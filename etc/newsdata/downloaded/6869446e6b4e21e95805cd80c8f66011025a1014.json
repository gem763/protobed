(AP Photo/Brennan Linsley, File)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said on Wednesday night that \u201cit\u2019s crazy\u201d that the United States spends about $13 million a year for each terrorism suspect held at the detention center at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and added that he would search for alternatives.\n\n\u201cI know about that,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington after a three-day campaign trip to New Mexico and California. \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy. It costs a fortune to operate, and I think it\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nBut he would not say whether he would consider closing the prison at Guant\u00e1namo. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a lot of things,\u201d he said without elaborating. Instead, he pointed out that his predecessor tried and failed to shutter the prison. \u201cLook, President Obama said that Guant\u00e1namo Bay would be closed, and he never got it done.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s comments came in reaction to a report in The New York Times tabulating the expense of housing the 40 prisoners remaining at Guant\u00e1namo, including the men accused of plotting the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. According to the report, the government spent more than $540 million last year to hold the prisoners, including pay for the military guards, the cost of the war court and related construction expenses.\n\nThe cost of $13 million per prisoner certainly makes the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo, which was set up by President George W. Bush\u2019s administration in the months after 9/11 and became a public relations liability, the world\u2019s most expensive prison.\n\nBy comparison, it cost U.S. taxpayers in 2012 just $78,000 per inmate at the \u201csupermax\u201d federal prison in Colorado, where some of the nation\u2019s most dangerous prisoners are kept and where some officials in the past have suggested transferring the Guant\u00e1namo detainees.\n\nBush sought to reduce the population before leaving office and released about 540 detainees, mostly transferring them to home countries like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Obama vowed during his 2008 presidential campaign to close Guant\u00e1namo, and his administration released another 200 through a similar approach.\n\nBut Obama was blocked by Congress from transferring the remaining detainees to any federal prison in the United States amid resistance to the idea of bringing terrorists to American soil. And when Trump ran for president in 2016, he vowed to keep Guant\u00e1namo open and even to send more terrorists there, although none have actually been added to the prison since he took office.\n\nIn his comments to reporters Wednesday night, Trump focused more on what to do with prisoners captured during the war with the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq and still held by the United States in the Middle East. The president has demanded that European allies take those prisoners who originally came from their countries. He repeated his threat to release them at the borders of those nations if they do not.\n\n\u201cThe big decision we have now is we have thousands of people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey came from other countries. We want those countries to take them back. We did them a big favor by stopping them. If they came from France, we want France to take them and to try and do whatever they have to do with them. But that\u2019s a very expensive situation.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said on Wednesday night that \"it's crazy\" that the United States spends about $13 million a year for each terrorism suspect held at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and added that he would search for alternatives.\"I know about that,", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tWU.zEmXq9NalbXQh7m88w--~B/aD0xNTIzO3c9MjE4NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/dca719f0-dae7-11e9-9f9d-829a162a4496", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
