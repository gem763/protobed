The sport has seen fans direct racial epithets at players, hold racist banners in the stands and hurl objects at opposing players and fans.\n\nAD\n\nEngland has not been immune from the problem. Chelsea banned six fans, one for life, after racist abuse was directed at Manchester City striker Raheem Sterling, who also plays for the national team. Manchester United strike Marcus Rashford, also a national team member, said last month soccer was \u201cgoing backward\u201d when it came to race relations within the sport.\n\nAD\n\nUEFA has punished Bulgaria with a partial stadium closure for the match against England because of racist fan behavior during recent matches against Czech Republic and Kosovo. The organization\u2019s three-step protocol calls for stadium officials to warn fans to cease any racist behavior upon a first offense. If the behavior persists, the referee is to stop the game and remove the teams from the field. Finally, the referee is to halt the game if the abuse continues.\n\nBut Abraham told the BBC the team had agreed to walk off the field together and disregard the UEFA process on perhaps the first or second incident of abuse, which could result in an English forfeit.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe did speak about that [the protocol],\u201d Abraham said. \u201cHarry Kane did ask the question about instead of going through the three steps, if we decide that we want to stop the game \u2014 no matter what the score is \u2014 if we\u2019re not happy with it, as a team we\u2019ll decide whether or not to stay on the pitch.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf it happens and let\u2019s say there\u2019s a warning or whatever in the stadium, then it happens again, we have to make a decision as a team and with the staff.\u201d\n\nDefender Trent Alexander-Arnold, of club team Liverpool, said if fans went after one England player, the entire team would respond.\n\n\u201cNobody should be made to feel uncomfortable on the pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone should be given the chance to play in a fair environment. We are a team. If one person is abused then we all are, we are one big family.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut English Manager Gareth Southgate told reporters: \u201cThere is the UEFA process and we have to have faith in that process. Then everything else is hypothetical. We want the players to be able to concentrate on football, they want to be judged on football. What I\u2019ve got to do is provide a secure, safe environment for them to play.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis is the first time England\u2019s team will play in Bulgaria since 2011, when English player Ashley Young was repeatedly called a \u201cmonkey\u201d by sections of the crowd.\n\n\u201cAs a player, with the situation that happened in Montenegro, I don\u2019t think as a team we were quite prepared and knowing there was a protocol in place,\u201d said Sterling, via Agence France-Presse. \u201cAs a team, we had a meeting and Gareth sat us down and explained there was a UEFA protocol. Now as players we have got to kind of give UEFA a chance to take that responsibility on board and deal with that situation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt this moment in time, full faith in UEFA.\u201d\n\nThose comments proved disconcerting for Bulgarian soccer officials. The president of the Bulgarian Football Union, Borislav Mikhaylov, wrote to UEFA, asking the organization to discipline the English side for spreading, \u201cderogatory claims\u201d the local spectators were \u201cpeople inclined to discriminatory behavior,\u201d according to The Guardian.\n\nAD\n\nUEFA has ordered Bulgaria to close at least 5,000 seats in its stadium, according to the AFP, and display a banner that reads \u201c#EqualGame.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The team is wary of racist behavior by Bulgarian fans at a Euro 2020 qualifying match on Monday.", "authors": ["Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aWYyRi6m7yYSPl4gJWeMOwqIauE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KYHF7GHLRMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
