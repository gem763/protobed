When they got to me, they said, \u2018We have reserved 25% of the procurement budget for you.\u2019 I chased them away, saying that I could not get involved in that.\u201d\n\nHe said the reason he had opened the case now would become clearer as it progressed, especially the link between allegations that he was involved in the assassination of prominent North West businessperson Wandile Bozwana, who was shot at least nine times in October 2015.\n\nHe said his rejection of the corrupt NTI offer triggered the formation of the North West Business Forum, the mission of which was to destroy him.\n\nBozwana was a member of the forum.\n\n\u201cI will prove that in court and people will clearly see the link,\u201d he said.\n\nMahumapelo said his analysis of the NTI offer was that it was meant to capture or compromise him.\n\n\u201cWhen you are compromised you cannot decide anything going forward. There is no way they can deny that they came to my hotel uninvited. And the statements of the two witnesses on my side, who were members of the board, will show that.\u201d\n\nHe said was no longer going to go easy on his detractors because \u201cwhen you are quiet, people think it is open season\u201d.\n\nGwabeni and Molapisi denied the alleged meeting with Mahumapelo. Gwabeni described Mahumapelo as an \u201cevil tyrant\u201d who projected himself as \u201crighteous and closer to God\u201d.\n\nHe said the erstwhile premier had \u201creached a cul-de-sac and he was now clutching at straws\u201d, adding that \u201cwith his level of pomposity, he would never have sat on such allegations for such a long time\u201d.\n\nHe said Mahumapelo should have found the nearest police station in Cape Town and opened the case.\n\n\u201cAnd after that he should have opened a case against himself because it is in contravention of law to keep quiet when you know of a crime being committed and his complacency must be investigated,\u201d he said.\n\nGwabeni, who previously chaired the NTI board, recalled a provincial cabinet meeting in Taung in Modimong on May 27 2015 when Mahumapelo allegedly tried to dissolve the board of the NTI because it had failed to appoint a transactional adviser to assess its possible sale to the Gauteng government.\n\nGwabeni said he opposed the move because South Africa was not a federal state and therefore a state company belonging to the North West by default belonged to the country and other provinces, such as Gauteng, as well.\n\n\u201cWe rejected the dissolution without due process.\u201d\n\nHe said that after the attempted dissolution of the board was challenged, four out of the seven board members resigned in a bid to collapse the body, but that also failed.\n\nHe said Molapisi \u2013 then the MEC of community safety and transport \u2013 was fired for contesting Mahumapelo\u2019s decision to move the administration of the school transport function from the provincial department of community safety and transport to the NTI.\n\nHe said Mahumapelo was trying to divert attention from the allegations that he was involved in Bozwana\u2019s murder, \u201cand the question is: Did he order the hit on Bozwana? If the answer is no, then the next question is: Was he happy about the activities of Bozwana?\u201d\n\nBefore his death, Bozwana had challenged Mahumapelo\u2019s government all the way to the Constitutional Court, attached state vehicles and often demonstrated outside Mahumapelo\u2019s McDonald\u2019s franchise store in Mahikeng.\n\nMolapisi questioned why Mahumapelo was opening the case now. \u201cI was serving in his cabinet then and thereafter. He should have removed me immediately; how do you work with somebody who is trying to corrupt you?\u201d", "description": "A belated criminal charge of extortion laid by ANC MP Supra Mahumapelo, the former North West premier, hinges on tenders at the provincial bus service company, the North West Transport Initiative, and an alleged dodgy offer made to him.", "authors": ["Setumo Stone", "Mandisa Nyathi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8935/8abf54d2f77944f3b4402bacb7e85732.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
