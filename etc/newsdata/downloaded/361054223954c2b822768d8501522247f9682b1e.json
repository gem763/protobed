In one recent case, involving Odebrecht SA, the Justice Department appeared to accept the Brazillian company\u2019s claims that it could not pay a $4.5 billion fine. The fine was to be split between governments in the U.S., Brazil and Switzerland. U.S. prosecutors agreed to subject the fine to an inability-to-repay analysis at a later date.\n\nThe guidance issued Tuesday instructs prosecutors to look at several considerations when assessing a company\u2019s claims, including its ability to raise capital and factors that led to its financial condition. Prosecutors are also encouraged to consider whether a possible fine could affect a company\u2019s ability to pay restitution to victims, according to the guidance.\n\nIn making their assessments, prosecutors are expected to collect information on a company\u2019s financial picture, including its cash flow, operating budget and divestiture plans. If prosecutors determine that a company cannot pay, they may recommend a lower fine or the implementation of an installment schedule.\n\nThe guidelines \u201chelp ensure that prosecutors stick to a more uniform set of considerations, and also that companies looking to resolve matters have greater insight into how prosecutors think,\u201d Mr. Benczkowski said.\n\nAdditionally, the Justice Department has renamed and reorganized its Securities and Financial Fraud Unit. It will now be known as the Market Integrity and Major Frauds Unit and will include five teams that focus on securities, commodities, government procurement, financial institutions and consumer fraud, respectively, Mr. Benczkowski said.\n\nWrite to Kristin Broughton at Kristin.Broughton@wsj.com", "description": "The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday issued guidance for federal prosecutors to use in cases where companies claim they can\u2019t pay a criminal fine.", "authors": ["Kristin Broughton", "Kristin.Broughton Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-114846/social", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
