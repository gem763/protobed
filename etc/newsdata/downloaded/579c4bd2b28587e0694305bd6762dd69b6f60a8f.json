Lindsey Graham after he criticized Trump's handling of the situation. (Oct. 16) AP, AP\n\nDAVENPORT, Ia. \u2014 President Donald Trump sold out United States allies and gave ISIS \"a new lease on life\" by withdrawing troops from Syria, former Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday.\n\nBiden, who is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, used a speech in Iowa to criticize several aspects of Trump's foreign policy, including the trade war with China and his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nTrump is \"a complete failure\" and \"the most reckless and incompetent commander-in-chief we've ever had,\" Biden said.\n\n2020 Election: 5 things we learned from the Democratic debate in Ohio\n\nBut he saved his harshest words for Trump's decision earlier this month to remove U.S. armed forces from northern Syria. Turkey subsequently invaded the country, including territory held by the Kurds, who were U.S. allies in the fight against ISIS.\n\n\"The events of this past week in Syria have brought devastating clarity to just how dangerous he is to our national security, to our leadership around the world, and to the lives of our brave men and women serving in uniform,\" Biden said, according to prepared remarks.\n\nThe decision to withdraw troops from Syria, Biden said, created a humanitarian crisis and gave ISIS \"a new lease on life by forcing the Kurds to defend themselves against Turkey instead of fighting ISIS remnants.\"\n\n\"These brave Kurdish and Arab forces paid a steep price, with over 10,000 making the ultimate sacrifice,\" Biden said, according to the prepared remarks. \"And then, Trump sold them out.\"\n\nTrump has stood by his decision.\n\n\"It's not our problem,\" the president told reporters Wednesday as Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo prepared to travel to Turkey to try to negotiate a ceasefire and avoid a humanitarian crisis on the Syrian border.\n\n\"Imagine how demoralizing this must be for our troops: Russian mercenaries taking victory laps inside the bases that President Trump ordered them to abandon. Turkey attacking the very people they fought alongside,\" Biden said.\n\nCLOSE The House has overwhelmingly voted its bipartisan condemnation of President Donald Trump's withdrawal of American forces from northern Syria. Democrats and Republicans banded together and approved a nonbinding resolution by 354-60 vote. (Oct. 16) AP, AP\n\nBiden also used the speech to highlight the Obama administration's efforts against ISIS.\n\n\"The Obama-Biden administration worked with and alongside partners in Syria with just a few hundred Americans supporting tens of thousands of local fighters to take the fight to ISIS on the ground,\" Biden said. \"Our strategy was so successful, it turned out that Trump\u2019s secret plan to defeat ISIS was to just keep doing what we were doing \u2014 until last week.\"\n\nTrump has faced bipartisan criticism for the withdrawal of troops, with the U.S. House voting overwhelmingly Wednesday afternoon to condemn the move.\n\n\"Even Republicans in Congress know this is irresponsible,\" Biden said. \"It's about the only time they've mustered the backbone to publicly criticize Trump.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/16/syria-joe-biden-criticizes-donald-trumps-troop-withdrawal-abandoning-kurds/4002870002/", "description": "\"The events of this past week in Syria have brought devastating clarity to just how dangerous he is to our national security, to our leadership around the world, and to the lives of our brave men and women serving in uniform,\" Biden said, according to prepared remarks.", "authors": ["Stephen Gruber-Miller", "Published P.M.
