He seems to think he is above the law.\n\n'As the Supreme Court showed us a few weeks ago, he is not. No-one is above the law, even a British Prime Minister.'\n\nShe said it is important to see what a Boris Johnson deal might look like, and that Parliament must be able to scrutinise his proposals. She said his current proposals 'cannot get through'.\n\nShe said, however, that if a deal was approved by Dublin and Brussels, it would be something that would be 'more likely' to pass Labour's tests.", "description": "Shami Chakrabarti accused the Prime minister of speaking with a 'forked tongue' over whether he legally has to seek a three-month delay to the departure from the EU.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/12/19359790-0-image-a-60_1570361990389.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
