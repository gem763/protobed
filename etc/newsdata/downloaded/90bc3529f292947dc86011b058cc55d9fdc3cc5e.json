Vahaamahina sees red after an elbow on Aaron Wainwright. Don't think there can be any complaints with that.

I\u2019m saying that\u2019s a red card.\u2019\n\nCaptain Guilhem Guirado and Vahaamahina himself had few complaints about the decision as Peyper explained it to them and the dismissed man held his hand up in apology to his team-mates as he jogged off the field.\n\nFormer Wales winger Shane Williams, working on the ITV coverage of the game, was left stunned by Vahaamahina\u2019s decision to hit Wainwright.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the right call [from the referee],\u2019 Williams said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s ridiculous.
