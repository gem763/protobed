A former world tour surfer herself, Rosy Hodge was well aware of the dangers associated with riding one of the \u201cmost treacherous waves in the world\u201d. So, too, Hamilton, but for altogether different reasons.\u200b\n\nOutwardly it appeared Hamilton was winning the physical battle as she launched straight back into the competition, eventually finishing third. But inwardly her mind was a jumbled mess of emotions. Hamilton was pregnant \u2013 unexpectedly, reluctantly \u2013 a fact weighing on her mind that she did not yet feel comfortable enough to tell anyone about. It wasn\u2019t surfing while pregnant that worried her, it was the daunting thought of motherhood itself.\u200b\n\n\u201cI knew that I was destined to be a mom one day or at least I hoped I would be,\u201d she tells Telegraph Women\u2019s Sport. \u201cBut then when it came my way, I kind of felt the opposite of that hope and desire and it shocked me,\u201d Hamilton, now 29, adds, referring to the moment she discovered she was pregnant with first son Tobias a few months before the invitational competition in Hawaii.\u200b\n\n\u201cI\u2019d only been married for just about a year, I wanted more time with my husband. I was pushing it with my sport and I was surfing better than ever. It was fun and challenging and I had a lot of drive going toward that. I felt like this was going to stop me.\u201d\u200b", "description": "When surfer Bethany Hamilton was flung from her board in a heavy fall during the 2014 Women\u2019s Pipe Invitational in Hawaii, the competition co-commentator took a sharp intake of breath.", "authors": ["Pippa Field", "Dame Sarah Storey", "Becky Downie"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/womens-sport/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000212487216-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8pxxW-EwPalPFlKF6QC4L1wmXXXyYzpkXK6P5iZeo1c.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
