We can take our anger out against Liverpool after the European disappointment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massive game and both teams will be going to win. We\u2019ll look forward to putting (the Valencia loss) right,\u201d Abraham added.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have a lot of ups and downs in a season. We\u2019ve got to move on and not dwell on it.\u201d\n\nLiverpool defender Virgil van Dijk, who made a rare error for Napoli\u2019s second goal, brushed off the notion that the loss was a wake-up call for the European champions.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a wake-up call - we have been performing outstanding since the start of the season and so there is no reason to panic,\u201d he said.\n\nLiverpool were held to a draw at Stamford Bridge last season, needing a late equaliser from Daniel Sturridge to take a point. The previous season Chelsea won 1-0 with a goal from Olivier Giroud.\n\nChampions Manchester City, beaten at promoted Norwich City last weekend will expect to get back to winning ways when they host Watford at the Etihad on Saturday.\n\nRelated Coverage Bullet point previews of Premier League matches\n\nPep Guardiola is without his two first-choice central defenders after John Stones joined Aymeric Laporte on the injury list.\n\nBrazilian Fernandinho partnered Nicolas Otamendi in the 3-0 Champions League win at Shakhtar Donetsk in Ukraine on Wednesday but 18-year-old Spanish defender Eric Garcia could be in contention for a start against the Hornets.\n\nFourth-placed Manchester United travel to West Ham United on Sunday while Tottenham Hotspur, who are third, face a tricky trip to Leicester City.", "description": "Frank Lampard's young Chelsea side face a major test of their progress when they face Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League on Sunday.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431432646&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I03N", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
