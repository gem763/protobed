I have to locate the fastball a little bit better and force their hand a little bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow it comes down to location,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are a few things I can sharpen up mechanically to make sure that happens.\u201d\n\nFormer Orioles outfielder Nick Markakis came off the injured list Friday and started in left field for the first time this season for the Braves.\n\nHe was 2-for-4 and drove in a run against Scherzer with a sacrifice fly in the fifth to make it 3-0.\n\n\u201cHe has always been a tough at-bat. You really have to execute pitches against him,\u201d Scherzer said.\n\nHowever, Scherzer (10-6) did not allow a home run for the first time in six outings.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t as crisp, but he battled,\u201d Washington manager Dave Martinez said of Scherzer. \u201cHe threw his fastball okay.\n\nHe was a tick off today. He gave us everything he had.\u201d\n\nAtlanta (92-57) now leads Washington (81-65) by 9 1/2 games in the National League East.\n\nThe Nationals were held to just three hits but still hold the top spot in wild-card race over the Chicago Cubs (79-68). Braves starter Mike Soroka (12-4) allowed just one hit and no runs in six innings.\n\n\u201cHe was very effective,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nThe three-game series with the Braves continues Saturday at 4:05 p.m. with the finale of\n\nthe set is Sunday afternoon at 1:35. Austin Voth is slated to pitch for the Nationals on Saturday, with Anibal Sanchez getting the ball on Sunday.\n\nWashington begins a three-game series Monday at the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
