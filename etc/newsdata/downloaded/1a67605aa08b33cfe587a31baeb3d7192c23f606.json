(Photo: Facebook/Peoria Police Department)\n\nA paralyzed police officer stood for the National Anthem, a goal 14 years in the making, during the Special Olympics in Arizona.\n\nOfficer William Weigt has been using a wheelchair since 2005, when he was shot in the line of duty. After a year of recovery, the 44-year-old former U.S. Army member rejoined the Peoria Police Department in Arizona as an Honor Guard member investigator, a job specifically created for him to continue serving his community.\n\nOn Friday, Weigt and his fellow officers graced the opening ceremonies for the Special Olympics Arizona Fall Games to present the American flag. But Weigt had a trick up his sleeve, and a surprise for Tiffanie, his wife of two years and their children. He planned to stand during the National Anthem using a specialized mode of transportation, the Permobil F5 power chair. \u201cBeing an Army veteran and not able to stand, it was a good moment,\u201d Weigt tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nWeigt uses the chair often to reach objects in high places, to help his range of motion and blood circulation, and even on a recent family to Disneyland. But he has never used it to stand during the National Anthem, until now.\n\nOver the weekend, the Peoria Police Department shared a photo and a video of Weigt\u2019s accomplishment, holding the American flag with one hand and the chair\u2019s controller in the other.\n\n\u201cI was standing, in total, for about 45 minutes,\u201d Weigt tells Yahoo Lifestyle, \u201cbecause we were going through a lot of dry runs to make sure we got it right.\u201d\n\nAfterward, Weigt drove himself home, exhausted and exhilarated, telling Yahoo Lifestyle, \u201cIt was well worth it.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Officer William Weigt, who has been paralyzed since 2005, stood for the National Anthem during Arizona's Special Olympics.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ch.P3imFk0nqVqshdQ.yVg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTA4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/d784b9c0-fa9d-11e9-bcf1-fa1d4ba3b55c", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
