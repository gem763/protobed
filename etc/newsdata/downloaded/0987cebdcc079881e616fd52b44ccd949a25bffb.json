But researchers say it should not turn off severely depressed women from taking them (file image)\n\nResearchers at the CHU Sainte-Justine medical centre in Montreal say the findings should not worry severely depressed women.\n\nThe study, published in the online journal British Medical Journal (BMJ) Open, is an observational one and can't establish a cause.\n\nThe experts, led by Professor Maelle Dandjinou, also said there was no link to gestational diabetes in women taking SSRIs - the most common antidepressants.\n\nIn the UK, fluoxetine is probably the best known SSRI and it is sold under the brand name Prozac.\n\nThe researchers speculate that antidepressants directly affect glucose metabolism, particularly as serotonin is involved in this process.\n\nSerotonin is found in the pancreas, specifically in the beta cells that release insulin to regulate blood glucose levels.\n\nRecent studies have shown the hormone to play a key role in controlling insulin secretion and that its absence leads to diabetes.\n\nWHAT IS GESTATIONAL DIABETES? Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that affects pregnant women, usually during the second or third trimester. Women with gestational diabetes do not have diabetes before their pregnancy. It usually goes away after the birth. It occurs when the hormones produced during pregnancy make it difficult for your body to use insulin properly, putting you at an increased risk of insulin resistance. Treatment focuses on managing blood sugar levels through diet, exercise and sometimes medication. Women can significantly reduce their risk of developing gestational diabetes by managing their weight, eating healthily and keeping active. Figures estimate one in five women will develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy. While it usually disappears after birth, sufferers are prone to complications such as overweight babies. High birth weight can lead to a complication called shoulder dystocia, where the shoulders of the baby get stuck in the birth canal during childbirth Source: Diabetes UK\n\nThe researchers also note that one of the side effects of antidepressants is weight gain - a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.\n\nThey drew on information from the Quebec Pregnancy Cohort, which includes all pregnancies in Quebec between 1998 and 2015.\n\nThere were 20,905 cases of gestational diabetes after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nResearchers randomly matched them with 10 unaffected pregnancies (209,050) of the same age and calendar year of delivery.\n\nAntidepressant use was assessed using information on prescriptions filled for these drugs between the start of pregnancy and the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.\n\nIn all, 9,741 - just over four per cent - of the mothers took antidepressants.\n\nResearchers then took account of potentially influential factors, such as the mother's age, welfare assistance, area of residence and other underlying conditions.\n\nWriting in the study, the researchers said: 'In this study, overall antidepressant use was associated with an increased risk for GDM.'\n\nThe research team also found the chance of gestational diabetes went up the longer the mothers-to-be had been taking the drugs.\n\nWomen who had been using antidepressants for less than 90 days saw a 15 per cent increased risk of gestational diabetes.\n\nThose who had been taking the drugs for less than 180 days were at a 17 per cent heightened chance of getting the condition.\n\nMeanwhile, expectant mothers who had been using the drugs for more than six months faced a 29 per cent greater risk.\n\nGestational diabetes affects around one in five pregnant women across the world, figures suggests.\n\nThe condition occurs when a woman's body cannot produce enough insulin to meet the extra needs of pregnancy, which causes blood sugar levels to spike.\n\nWhile it usually disappears after birth, sufferers are prone to complications such as overweight babies.\n\nHigh birth weight can lead to a complication called shoulder dystocia, where the shoulders of the baby get stuck in the birth canal during childbirth\n\nThe children of these pregnancies may also be more vulnerable to obesity and diabetes later on, according to other research.\n\nMothers are also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life.\n\nDiabetes affected 422million people globally in 2014, according to the World Health Organization. Some 90 per cent of adult patients suffer from type 2.", "description": "Researchers looked at every birth in\u00a0Quebec, Canada, between 1998 and 2015.
