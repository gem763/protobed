And the people know it,\u201d Democrat senators wrote in a legal brief.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the Court can heal itself before the public demands it be \u2018restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics\u2019.\u201d\n\nHighlighting sensitivity over the court\u2019s work, Republicans reacted in fury, saying the Democrats were a clear threat to judicial independence.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Sexual minority rights, abortion, immigration and guns \u2014 the Supreme Court convenes Monday to address an incendiary list of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/038665_immigration-is-one-contentious-set-tackled-supreme-court-in-its-new-session-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
