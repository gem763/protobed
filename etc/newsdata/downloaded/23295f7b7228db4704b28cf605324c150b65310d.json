Despite having executed a gorgeous pink-frocked waltz the previous week and giving Uma Thurman a run for her money in leggy loveliness, this just wasn\u2019t Anneka\u2019s dance. She clod-hopped out, grinning gamely but knowing deep down she was doomed.\n\nAnneka is untrained, and although she\u2019s physically in the best nick of anyone I know, she has never danced in a professional capacity in her life. She didn\u2019t go to theatre school and she has certainly never appeared dancing on the West End stage. Some of the other contestants (both past and present) have, because I\u2019ve seen them.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Some have definite dance form, others have none and some are a bit of a mystery. Let\u2019s just say that past dance triumphs are played down by the production, but, as a Twitter follower pointed out to me, would we really want to see an entire show of Ann Widdecombes? Certainly not. To be honest, I never want to see that woman\u2019s face again and I think Strictly\u2019s transformation of Widdecombe into some kind of harmless panto dame was one of the most terrifying PR jobs in recent times.\n\nWhat bothers me is that when children watch the programme, they are being told that if you try very, very hard then you will do very, very well and score lots of points whilst the ones lumping around like Lego need to try harder. Being trained in dance is, funnily enough, an extraordinary advantage in a dance competition.\n\nAs someone whose training stopped aged seven, I know that thanks to a certain natural bendiness I can make some extraordinary moves, but I have no musical ability whatsoever and cannot follow choreography to save my life. I once had to march on stage with two other women and would set off on the wrong foot every night. See, I can\u2019t even march in time and marching is really just walking.\n\nDancers have muscle memory, which is the thing that makes experienced dancers instinctively point their feet in the right direction and hold their shoulders just so.\n\nDancing isn\u2019t just about being fit either; even sports stars who have the right physique and the correct mentality can come a cropper on Strictly. Some of them don\u2019t have what I call \u201cmirror-ball imagination\u201d and fail to put any pizazz into their routines. They might be spot on with the steps but there\u2019s no magic.\n\nThere are definite exceptions to this rule. This year it\u2019s been great to see the female football player Alex Scott develop some gorgeous performance skills, whilst the Paralympic tennis table champ Will Bayley had everyone in tears last week with an interpretive dance piece that left judge Motsi Mabuse unable to speak.\n\nWill, being a sportsman with a disability, is so determined he will push and push and push himself, to the point of injury, that he couldn\u2019t dance at the weekend. That\u2019s another problem with expecting so much from the untrained: they have no idea how to save themselves from harm. They will \u201chave a go\u201d, because they don\u2019t know what the consequences might be. Even the pros get hurt, too, but most of the time they have the balance and the strength to avoid serious damage.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time the most improved couple got a few extra points? For me it\u2019s been a revelation watching fellow stand-up Chris Ramsey, who has plenty of stage experience but none of it in dance, fighting so hard to keep up. The man is doing his best, he\u2019s almost cross-eyed with concentration and yet there he is down at the bottom of the leaderboard. Which just goes to show kids that you can do your very best and still get ripped apart by the judges, because rather than attending Miss Miggin\u2019s academy of ballroom dancing since the age of three, you\u2019ve spent your career chatting into a mic.\n\nDespite my reservations, I\u2019m sticking with Strictly: it\u2019s just that nowadays when I\u2019m watching in my pyjamas on the sofa I\u2019m mentally scoring two different competitions, one for the pros and one for the Strictly amateurs. I know who I\u2019m rooting for the most.", "description": "I\u2019ve been struggling with Strictly this year, ever since my mate Anneka Rice left in week three.
