Disney\n\n\"Her life and activities are followed extensively by the media and the public.\"\n\nThe court documents add: \"The Opposition, which claims that consumers are likely to be confused between a boutique wedding event planning business and Blue Ivy Carter, the daughter of two of the most famous performers in the world, is frivolous and should be refused in its entirety.\"\n\nBeyonce's legal team also emphasized she is applying to trademark \"Blue Ivy Carter\", her daughter's full name, adding it identifies the child's \"celebrity\" rather than Ms. Morales' \"regional event planning business.\"\n\nTheir legal documents say Ms. Morales runs a \"small business\" with just a \"handful of employees\", a small online presence and poorly subscribed social media accounts.\n\nAccording to the Boston-based Blue Ivy events planning website, it has sites in New England, Florida, and California.\n\nThe trademark application was filed in January 2016, records show, with Ms. Morales filing her opposition in May 2017.\n\nBeyonce and Jay-Z are also parents to 2-year-old twins Rumi and Sir Carter.", "description": "The \"Lemonade\" singer filed an application to trademark the name of her eldest child in 2016.
