Malcom Walker, who looks after the boats in the dock, is seen climbing over a wall before going into a smaller boat to pick up the parcel which he hands over to the delivery driver.\n\nFull footage shows Malcolm telling the delivery driver to knock on the door, open it and shout Cheryl to make her aware that the parcels have arrived.\n\nAfter tripping up the driver was seen trying to reach a parcel he had dropped\n\nHe then goes onto the gangway and waits for the door to open and then explains what happens before leaving.\n\nThe driver then returns to take a picture of the parcel to say it had been delivered after saying it was undeliverable. Andrew's video has been viewed over 6,000 times. Liam Aaron Gillan wrote under Andrew's post: 'That's f*****g outrageous.'\n\nChristine Moore added: 'Unbelievable. But not in a way. What a t***.'\n\nMarie Brown disagreed and condemned the post writing: 'Feel for the guy to be honest. 'Ok he obviously shouldn't have thrown the package but I'd be annoyed -you live somewhere awkwardly accessible and the guy tripped on your gangway- lucky he didn't hurt himself and sue you.'\n\nSpeaking today Andrew said: 'I'm really offended and furious that happened and the swearing, there are kids around in the area. He just opened the door and then started shouting hello.\n\n'My mum could have just come out of the shower and could have been walking around half naked as some people do.'\n\nHe said his mother was horrified at what had happened and added that the situation was 'outrageous'.\n\n'Amazon came back to me saying 'we may need to look at retraining' and get back to me within 24 hours. I have to pay to repackage it and deliver it back to them. They haven't offered a refund for the damage.\n\n'The microwave has a massive dent on the side and the other was covered in water. I'm currently on holiday in Crete and I'm trying to deal with it and it's ruined our holiday.'\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said: 'We have very high standards for our delivery service providers and expect every package to be handled with care.\n\n'We have taken this incident seriously and have reached out to the customer to ensure the matter is resolved to their satisfaction.'", "description": "The driver had struggled to manage to reach the doorway of a boat, stumbling and dropping one of the parcels into the water.
