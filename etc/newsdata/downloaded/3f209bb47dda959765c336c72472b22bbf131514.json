As van Aanholt turns on his heel and hurriedly lays the ball back to Mamadou Sakho, Liverpool\u2019s remorseless front six scent blood. Mo Salah leads the hunt. Roberto Firmino tags in. A tentative pass into central midfield is the trigger for Naby Keita to join the press. Then Sadio Mane. Then Jordan Henderson and Andy Robertson. In the blink of an eye, Crystal Palace are being overrun, swamped by waves of red, the sharks circling, the Anfield crowd howling.\n\nThis is a story that normally has only one ending, and it\u2019s not with Andros Townsend thumping the ball home in front of a stunned Kop to put Crystal Palace 1-0 up after a brilliant, devastating counter-attack. But that\u2019s exactly what happened at Anfield in January: a sweeping 10-pass move, featuring almost the entire Palace team, with James McArthur and James Tomkins both executing Cruyff turns. It\u2019s one of the great forgotten Premier League goals: lost in the dizzying drama of the finish, in which Liverpool won 4-3, it didn\u2019t even make the shortlist for Goal of the Month. Like much of what takes place over the course of a 380-game season, it simply was, and then to all intents and purposes, it wasn\u2019t.\n\nPart of the reason for this, I think, is that it didn\u2019t really fit into any established pattern of behaviour. Nobody watches football \u2018clean\u2019: what we see is conditioned by what we\u2019ve seen before, what we want to see, and what we\u2019ve come to expect. And without wishing to descend into a tiresome reductio ad guardiolum, in which no discussion of English football is complete until someone has mentioned Pep Guardiola, it\u2019s fair to say that if his Manchester City side had scored that goal, the internet would have gone positively pink with delight. The Match of the Day pundits would have been moistening themselves on air.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut this was Crystal Palace, and more specifically Roy Hodgson\u2019s Crystal Palace, and everyone knows what to expect from them. It\u2019s two years this week since Hodgson arrived at Selhurst Park, the boyhood Palace fan who used to watch from the Holmesdale Road terraces as a kid, and now, in his eighth decade, was finally sitting in the dugout. Even now, as Hodgson\u2019s side sit fourth in the table, with a squad of offcuts and journeymen assembled on a relative shoestring, there\u2019s a sense that one of the Premier League\u2019s genuine feel-good stories is hiding in plain sight.\n\nExcept at some point, we made the collective decision that Hodgson wasn\u2019t allowed to be a feel-good story. After all, he failed with Liverpool, and he failed with England, and of course any manager who has ever failed must forever be deemed a failure. Quite apart from which, there\u2019s never been a less fashionable time to be a septuagenarian English manager playing organised, conservative football. In a game obsessed with novelty and innovation, new faces and new frontiers, Hodgson offers the very opposite: the known known, the flat back four, a gnarled and grizzled familiarity.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 20 players with something to prove this weekend Show all 21 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Getty Images 6/21 Neal Maupay (Brighton & Hove Albion) Brighton's \u00a316m summer signing is still working to consolidate his place in Graham Potter's preferred starting XI. A goal against Burnley on Saturday would certainly help his cause. CameraSport via Getty Images 7/21 Lewis Cook (Bournemouth) The midfielder is yet to feature this season as he continues his comeback from knee ligament damage. But he did play sixty minutes for the club in a behind-closed-doors friendly against QPR and could yet make the first-team squad this weekend. AFC Bournemouth via Getty Images 8/21 Matty Longstaff (Newcastle United) Newcastle have something of an injury crisis on their hands for their trip to Liverpool, with as many as seven first-team players absent. An injury to Sean Longstaff could meanwhile see his younger brother, Matty, make Steve Bruce's travelling squad. Getty Images 9/21 Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (Southampton) All eyes will be on the 24-year-old this weekend after he was challenged by manager Ralph Hasenhuttl to sign a new Southampton contract. \u201cWe are always in contact with his agent and Pierre knows about his important role for this club,\" the Southampton boss said.

He has scored four goals in four appearances for Burnley.

Chelsea desperate need him to hit the ground running, which will be difficult considering his lack of pre-season.

West Ham United FC via Getty Ima 16/21 Michael Keane (Everton) Michael Keane is another player who will hope to shrug off the international break when he returns to domestic duty this weekend. With John Stones and Joe Gomez injured, Keane partnered Harry Maguire in England's defence, only to make a horrific individual error as Kosovo opened the scoring in Southampton on Tuesday night.

Arsenal FC via Getty Images 18/21 Jordan Ayew (Crystal Palace) The 28-year-old was named Crystal Palace's player of the month after scoring twice in three games for the club. He will hope to continue his scoring streak when Palace play Spurs, and given Tottenham's recent form, will surely find himself with ample opportunities on the counter-attack. Getty Images 19/21 James Maddison (Manchester United) Manchester United sniffed around James Maddison this summer, ultimately deciding against bidding for the 22-year-old. But the speculation has persisted and all eyes will be on the midfielder at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon.

Getty Images\n\nThis isn\u2019t the start of some tedious debate about \u201ccredit\u201d, that utterly indefinable and thus infinitely arguable concept which appears to have become football\u2019s latest buzzword. Nor is this a parochial plea on behalf on the poor, endangered British manager. Besides, Hodgson always deserved better than to be lumped in with that sort of company anyway: your Hugheses and Pardews and Pulises and Allardyces. From Halmstad to the Hawthorns, Hodgson\u2019s CV always emanated a sort of exotic mystery that few of his contemporaries could match: a taste for adventure, an allergic dislike of comfort, a refusal to conform to type.\n\nThe irony is that while Hodgson\u2019s urbane cosmopolitanism was held against him when he first arrived in English football, the wheel has come full circle. Hodgson is one of the dinosaurs now, a product not just of his age and nationality, the sort of football his sides play or the sort of clubs he manages, but of tone. In an era where managers fancy themselves as televangelists, real-life Instagram influencers who aren\u2019t just picking a team but selling a lifestyle, Hodgson stands alone: the cussed realist, the weatherman who simply tells you that it\u2019s going to rain tomorrow, rather than trying to get you to buy into his exciting precipitation vision.\n\nAt a charity event this week, Hodgson was asked by the moderator whether he thought Palace could break out of its bottom-half purgatory and challenge the bigger clubs. For the modern managervangelist, this sort of thing is an easy win: a chance to talk about dreams and desire and never putting a ceiling on your ambition. Instead, Hodgson told the truth. \u201cIf I\u2019m realistic, I\u2019m not certain we can,\u201d he replied. \u201cStaying in the Premier League is always going to be the be-all and end-all for us: a bit of suffering. There's not going to be rainbows and blue skies and rose-coloured spectacles. There\u2019s going to be plenty of fighting and heartache along the way.\u201d\n\nThis, above all, is probably what\u2019s going to get Hodgson the sack at some point. But for now, things are modestly looking up. Two years after taking over a club bottom of the table, Hodgson has finished 11th and 12th, beaten five of the Big Six, won at the Etihad, the Emirates and Old Trafford, given Liverpool the scare of their lives. With the caveat that calendar-year tables are silly and meaningless and Definitely Not A Thing, Palace nonetheless sit third in a theoretical 2019 version, ahead of Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham, their opponents on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, despite losing Aaron Wan-Bissaka in the summer, spending just \u00a36 million on reinforcements and barely possessing a striker worthy of the name, Palace are still capable of springing a surprise. It was Hodgson who was instrumental in recasting Townsend and Wilfried Zaha as a slaloming front two, a move that has seen Zaha score more goals in this last two seasons than in the previous six combined. Vicente Guaita in goal has become an increasingly important springboard. Their centre-halves may not overlap like Sheffield United\u2019s - indeed, you suspect that such a tactic would literally kill Gary Cahill - but they turn up, hold the line, win their headers and do their jobs.\n\nReputations stick in this business. There comes a point in any career where the legacy is no longer open to renegotiation, when opinions can no longer be contested, only reinforced. This is doubly true when you\u2019re 72-years-old, your biggest jobs have been and gone, and everyone remembers that GIF of you looking sad at the 2014 World Cup. But Hodgson has spent a lifetime challenging conventions: that English managers never go abroad, that old-timers can\u2019t relate to the new generation, that modern players get turned off by relentless drills on defensive spacing, that it\u2019s impossible to be simultaneously Saul Bellow\u2019s biggest fan and Martin Kelly\u2019s, that defenders need to think like midfielders, that nobody ever recovers from messing up the England job, that romantic homecomings are inevitably doomed to failure. But then, that\u2019s the thing about innovation. If you spend long enough at it, it begins to look an awful lot like stasis.", "description": "From the moment Patrick van Aanholt runs into trouble near the left touchline, there\u2019s a vaguely foreboding sense that this might just end badly.
