Advertisements that objectify women. Song content. Some of my old songs, I would never write or sing today. I get embarrassed by some of that stuff. It just took a lot of time and growth to get to that place.\"\n\nBack in 2015, a US jury ruled that pop stars Robin and Pharrell had to pay more than $7m in damages to Marvin Gaye's family.\n\nWhy? Because according to their ruling the pair copied the late artist's music in writing the the 2013 mega-hit.\n\nThe eight-member California panel found that the pop stars lifted parts of Gaye's 1977 hit Got to Give It Up.\n\nCompiled by Alex Isaacs.
