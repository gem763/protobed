And we\u2019re actually fine with that because we don\u2019t really think we\u2019re competitors.\u201d", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Quibi, the Hollywood-backed streaming service set to launch next April, will offer people on the go short-form content that can", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/4cd92c_quibi-is-new-mobile-centric-short-form-streaming-service-aimed-millennials-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
