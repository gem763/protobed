She has been on hunger strike for a month to protest her detention.\n\nAccording to attorney Jawad Boulos, the 24-year-old was interrogated for 16 days straight without being allowed to see a lawyer. Boulos, who has since visited Labadi in prison, said the interrogations lasted hours while she was handcuffed to a chair. The interrogators, Boulos wrote, cursed and spit at Labadi, and threatened to arrest her sister and mother.\n\n\"All the means of torture and oppression were used to force her to sign a damning confession,\" Boulos said. \"But despite the cruel investigation, she did not confess.\"\n\nMiri, 29, was also arrested at the Allenby border crossing on September 2, where he was travelling to attend a relative's wedding in the occupied West Bank. He has suffered from brain cancer since 2010, and has undergone several surgeries.\n\nThe Palestinian Prisoners Affairs Authority published a letter by Labadi on October 8, where she recounted details of her interrogation.\n\n\"The Israelis threatened me with administrative detention if I did not confess, saying they did not have evidence against me but they could renew my detention for seven and a half years,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I've lost my sense of being as they do not know what humanity is. I told the interrogator that the psychological torture they carry out is much worse than physical torture - and he replied saying he knows that.\"\n\nIsrael has not given reasons for Labadi or Miri's detention. There are a total of 25 Jordanian citizens imprisoned by the Israeli occupation forces.\n\nEarlier this month, Jordan's foreign ministry said it summoned the Israeli envoy in Amman and handed him a letter protesting the two citizens' detention.\n\nIsraeli infiltrator arrested\n\nMeanwhile, Jordanian authorities arrested an Israeli man who infiltrated the kingdom through the northern border on Tuesday.\n\nThe man was being questioned before he is referred to the relevant authorities to take necessary legal measures, foreign ministry spokesman Sufian al-Qudah said, without giving more details.\n\nSome lawmakers called on the government not to release the Israeli man unless Israel frees the two detained Jordanians.\n\nJordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, becoming the second country in the Arab world after Egypt to establish diplomatic ties with Tel Aviv. The 25th anniversary of the agreement is this month.\n\nIn 2017, a diplomatic crisis between the two nations erupted when an Israeli embassy guard in Amman killed two Jordanians, an act that Israel described as self-defence.\n\nFollowing the incident, the guard and other embassy staff returned to Israel as the embassy in Amman closed for several months.", "description": "Jordan's FM Ayman al-Safadi demands the immediate release of two Palestinian-Jordanian citizens arrested by Israel.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/30/20894de5fb574f6d90146c8e6925b584_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
