You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThese are the key issues for holidaymakers with a booking involving Thomas Cook.\n\nCURRENTLY ABROAD\n\nI am on a Thomas Cook package holiday. What happens now?\n\nYour trip will continue as normal, with hotel bills paid and new flights provided by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) under the terms of the Air Transport Organiser\u2019s Licence (Atol).\n\nThe CAA has brought in a wide range of airlines to provide flights for Thomas Cook customers. The airlift, codenamed Operation Matterhorn, aims to replicate as closely as possible the original schedule, though with larger-than-usual aircraft being deployed it may be that \u2013 for example \u2013 flights to Bristol and Cardiff are combined. In such cases, coaches will be laid on to complete the journey.\n\nYou will be told when your replacement flight will be departing. The CAA says that in the Monarch airlift in 2017, 98 per cent of customers returned on the date they were originally scheduled to fly. No-one was asked to return home any earlier than originally planned, so no holidays were cut short.\n\nIf you are in the US, Mexico or the Caribbean, it may be that you will be flown home on a scheduled airline.\n\nI am abroad with a flight-only Thomas Cook ticket and no Atol protection. What happens to me?\n\nIf you are booked on a short-haul flight to the Mediterranean, Portugal or Atlantic islands, you will be offered a seat in the airlift operation. The government has taken the view that there is insufficient capacity among scheduled airlines and the foreign secretary said that no British holidaymakers will be stranded.\n\nThis assurance may not apply for long-haul flights. But \u201crescue\u201d fares will be provided by other airlines, such as British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Norwegian, United, American Airlines and Delta.\n\nEach airline normally announces its policy within 24 hours of any collapse. Fares are likely to be \u00a3150-\u00a3200 one-way, on production of proof of a Thomas Cook booking.\n\nYou can then claim back the cost of the original flight from the credit-card provider or travel insurance.\n\nI am abroad on a package holiday from another tour operator, but which uses Thomas Cook Airlines flights. What happens?\n\nYour tour operator (the holiday company that put the trip together) has primary responsibility to find an alternative flight for you. If you are in Europe, you are likely to be booked on one of the Operation Matterhorn airlift flights. From long-haul destinations your tour operator should come up with an alternative. This should be at no cost to yourself.\n\nYET TO TRAVEL\n\nI have a Thomas Cook package holiday booked. Will it go ahead?\n\nAlmost certainly not. The Civil Aviation Authority says: \u201cIn some cases we will appoint a fulfilment partner to provide the holiday.\u201d But that would be a rare event, and it is much more usual that your holiday will be cancelled.\n\nWhile dozens of flights are departing from UK airports to collect Thomas Cook passengers, they will not be carrying passengers outbound.\n\nWill I get my money back?\n\nYes. All package holidays sold in the UK are protected by the Atol scheme, administered by the CAA.\n\nCurrent customers who paid for some or all of the trip by credit card will be told to apply to their card issuer for a full refund, whether for a package holiday (flights and accommodation bought in the same transaction) or a flight-only ticket.\n\nPeople who paid for a package holiday with a debit card should make a claim under the Atol scheme. However, because of the scale of the collapse, obtaining a refund could take months.\n\nFlight-only customers who paid with a debit card can ask the bank for reimbursement under the \u201cchargeback\u201d scheme. Although there is no legal requirement for debit card issuers to pay out if the supplier collapses, this voluntary scheme is likely to provide cover.\n\nIf, for some reason, your bank does not refund you, travel insurance may help.\n\nI have flight-only tickets with Thomas Cook. Who refunds me?\n\nThese are unlikely to be Atol protected. If you paid with a credit card, you should be able to get a refund under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act \u2013 as long as the purchase is over \u00a3100. If it is less than that, or you paid with a debit card, go for \u201cchargeback\u201d.\n\nIf you handed over cash to pay for the flights, your best hope is travel insurance.\n\nI booked Thomas Cook flights, but arranged accommodation and car rental separately. Who do I claim from?\n\nYou have no automatic right of refund. Ask the providers of they room and rental car if they will allow you to cancel without penalty. If they do not offer a refund, you then have the option to go ahead with the trip using replacement flights (which could well be more expensive) or abandon the holiday and try to claim for \u201cconsequential losses\u201d from your insurer.\n\nMy trip is a package holiday from a different firm, but with Thomas Cook flights. Will it go ahead if Thomas Cook fails?\n\nProbably. The tour operator who put the trip together will need to try to find alternative flights. It may be that these will cost substantially more, and you may be asked to pay the difference. Were this to happen, you should be able to ask for a full refund of the cost of the holiday instead.\n\nI booked a holiday through a Thomas Cook travel agent with a different tour operator. Will my trip still go ahead?\n\nAlmost certainly, although you will need to contact the tour operator to check the status of your booking.\n\nI really need to travel. Will fares on other airlines increase?\n\nYes, prices are likely to soar in response to the sudden surge of demand from desperate holidaymakers. But if you can bide your time it is possible that other airlines will offer special low fares to travellers who can show they were originally booked on Thomas Cook.\n\nOTHER ISSUES\n\nI have a travel insurance policy issued by Thomas Cook. Is it still valid?\n\nYes. Thomas Cook will have sold you the policy on behalf of a separate travel insurer.\n\nI am owed hundreds of pounds by Thomas Cook following a heavily delayed flight. What are my rights?\n\nUnfortunately, you are an unsecured creditor and are unlikely to see a significant proportion of the cash.\n\nI was given a Thomas Cook gift card, and it still has money on it. Can I claim it back?\n\nNot from the company. But there is a chance that whoever bought you the card may be able to recoup the original cost from their credit-card firm or bank.\n\nIf they paid cash, it is most unlikely any money will come back.\n\nI have a Thomas Cook Cash Passport prepaid card. Is the money on it safe?\n\nYes. The cards are issued by Wirecard Card Solutions Ltd and operated separately from Thomas Cook. Wirecard is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.", "description": "Thomas Cook, the original package holiday company, is teetering on the brink of collapse.
