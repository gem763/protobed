David Rittich stopped 24 shots in his fifth straight start, and dropped to 2-4 with a 3.67 goals against average in six starts against Vegas.\n\nNosek got his third goal of the season after William Carrier broke into the zone from the right side and was stuffed by Rittich, who couldn't locate the puck after making the save. Nosek was there to clean up the rebound and punched it in to give Vegas an early 1-0 lead.\n\nThe teams combined for five goals in the second period.\n\nAndersson got it started when he took Mikael Backlund's pass on a 2-on-1 rush and lasered a wrist shot past Fleury to tie the score.\n\nKnights seize momentum\n\nJust 33 seconds later, Gaudreau got his third of the season when his shot deflected off Vegas forward William Karlsson's stick and past Fleury to give the Flames a 2-1 lead.\n\nMark Stone followed his own shot after Rittich's initial save and slammed the puck through the goalie's five-hole to tie the score 2-2.\n\nLater in the period, William Karlsson grabbed the puck behind the net and fed Carrier, who backhanded the puck off the crossbar for his second of the season to put Vegas back in front.\n\nThe Golden Knights seized the momentum when Stastny grabbed a rebound off the board, skated to the slot and fired a wrist shot under Rittich's pads to push the lead to 4-2.\n\nReaves added a goal in the third period when he intercepted a pass near the blue line and beat Rittich with a wrist shot through the pads to extend Vegas' advantage to three goals.\n\nLater in the period, Glass' backhanded pass went off Calgary wing Johnny Gaudreau's pad for his second career goal.
