The Houthi claims remain unverified, but a success of this scale would make the assault a tremendous victory for the rebels.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not yet commented on the claims, which, if true, would mark another embarrassment for the country just weeks after its oil production was temporarily crippled in drone and missile attacks on Saudi oil sites, attacks that the country was unable to defend itself against, attacks claimed by the Houthis. Saudi Arabia has the world's third largest annual defense budget.\n\nWeapon allegedly belonging to Saudi forces captured by Houthi forces is seen after an attack near the border with Saudi Arabia's southern region of Najran in Yemen, in this still image taken from video on September 29, 2019.

Saudi Arabia has concluded that the drone and missile strikes were \"unquestionably sponsored by Iran,\" but the country has yet to accuse Iran of launching the attack on Saudi Arabia.", "description": "If true, the Houthi victory would mark another major setback for Saudi Arabia in the wake of the recent drone and missile attacks on its oil sites.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9213672e22af242733d304?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
