But it shouldn\u2019t have. U.S. policy on Syria has teetered on a thread for more than a year, with many questions about what Washington\u2019s long-term goal was in eastern Syria. While the United States got involved in Syria conflict for a variety of reasons, the central mission that brought U.S. soldiers to eastern Syria has been the defeat of the Islamic State\u2014a goal that was partly accomplished. However, the United States has messages to its partners on the ground and its allies in the region that it has other, often conflicting goals, such as ensuring Turkey\u2019s security and leveraging Syria to reduce Iran\u2019s influence. The decision to withdraw, even partly, after almost eight years of engagement with the Syrian conflict, throws much of that in doubt.\n\nIt\u2019s worth looking back at the U.S. role in Syria over the last eight years to understand the complexities involved. The Syrian conflict and America\u2019s role in it is unique but has some antecedents. Washington has sent Americans into a variety of operations with some similar characteristics, such as Operation Enduring Freedom to confront terror in Afghanistan after September 11, or Operation Gothic Serpent in Somalia in 1993, aimed at capturing a warlord. Operation Inherent Resolve\u2019s expansion to Syria began in September 2014 and was aimed at degrading ISIS abilities, especially keeping ISIS from taking the mostly Kurdish city of Kobane on the Turkish border.\n\nThe United States was already involved in Syria by the time this operation began. While today\u2019s U.S. role in eastern Syria grew directly from the September 2014 decision to strike at ISIS, leading the United States to partner with local Kurdish forces, the larger picture was more complex. In July 2011, Robert Ford, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, went to Hama where protesters had gathered against the regime of Bashar al-Assad. \u201cHe witnessed average Syrians asking for change in their country,\u201d accounts noted at the time. Ford expressed solidarity with protesters, angering the regime. He was pulled out by Washington in October 2011 due to credible threats against him.\n\nThe United States decided to help the Syrian rebels. This was supported by then-CIA director David Petraeus and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, among others. Republicans also supported the program, which saw rebel units vetted and equipped. The initial optimism about the rebels quickly wore thin in 2013 as the groups became more radicalized and foreigners began to be kidnapped in northern Syria. The program would continue but eventually it would be seen as a failure, with assertions that more than $500 million had been \u201cwasted\u201d by 2016. The program was actually larger than that, reaching towards $1 billion by 2017. But U.S. newspapers began reporting in 2015 that only \u201cfour or five\u201d of the rebels who were trained were actually fighting, which made observers and policymakers wary of continuing U.S. commitment. U.S. weapons ended up in the hands of other groups besides those they were intended to go to. This was a byproduct of the Syrian rebellion; the opposition to Assad was fractured and preyed upon by extremists. Some of those extremists eventually joined ISIS. The Obama administration appeared to take a \u201ccondescending attitude\u201d toward the failure of the program that supported the rebels and became distracted by other issues, such as policies in Asia.\n\nThe reality was more than just American fatigue at not being able to find effective allies in Syria to train and equip. Washington was trying to get its global partners to sign onto the Iran Deal in 2014 and 2015 and the Syria rebels were fighting the Iranian-backed Assad regime. Obama had warned the Assad regime in 2012 about crossing a \u201cred line\u201d in Syria using chemical weapons. But in August 2013 the United States failed to act and the \u201cred line\u201d was not enforced. It was clear from that point the United States would not get directly in toppling Assad.\n\nThe decision not to strike Assad came despite the State Department\u2019s strong language against his regime. John Kerry, who was secretary of state during the Obama administration, described him as a \u201cthug and a murderer\u201d in August 2013. Kerry also asserted that if the United States did nothing about his use of poison gas then \u201cthere will be no end to the test of our resolve and the dangers that will flow.\u201d Kerry would continue to insist that there was no place for Assad in Syria\u2019s future. At this crucial moment the United States began to pursue several different strategies at once, with Kerry involved in the Geneva process discussions about \u201cpolitical transition\u201d in Syria. Inevitably the State Department track would relate to other states that were involved, such as Turkey, Russia and Iran. Turkey opposed the regime, while Russia and Iran supported it. For the United States that would mean NATO ally Turkey was a perfect partner. But a new problem had emerged on the horizon.", "description": "Most countries, including Turkey, Iran and Russia, do not train and equip locals only to then leave them to be attacked.", "authors": ["Seth J.
