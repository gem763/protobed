But a microphone mishap that temporarily suspended the event made headlines and prompted a mocking tweet from President Trump.\n\nGiven the president\u2019s fixation on CNN, there is some probability he will be tuning in on Tuesday. Hours before the broadcast, Mr. Trump tweeted falsely that the network\u2019s president, Jeff Zucker, \u201cwill be resigning momentarily.\u201d (In fact, Mr. Zucker was on the job in Ohio overseeing debate preparations.)\n\nIn an interview, Sam Feist, CNN\u2019s Washington bureau chief, said he was not sweating the unprecedented number of candidates in the debate .\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had 11 before, and now we have 12,\u201d Mr. Feist said between rehearsals at Otterbein University, in the cavernous gymnasium that has been converted into a one-night-only soundstage with seating for 1,500 people. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really change our approach.\u201d\n\nTo accommodate the jumbo-sized event, a small army of CNN crew members installed 550 lights, 50 speakers and at least 16 cameras inside the Clements Recreation Center, a building typically used as a campus fitness center. The candidates will stand at a dozen slender, identical lecterns installed in front of a glowing, 70-foot-long wall of LED lights.\n\nNot all of the preparation can be seen onstage.\n\nCandidates can be prickly about their personal space, particularly at a high-stakes event with the potential to either elevate or diminish their campaigns. In 2015, rival campaigns squabbled over the amenities of their backstage facilities at a CNBC-sponsored debate in Boulder, Colo. One adviser to Senator Rand Paul claimed that Mr. Rubio\u2019s quarters featured cushier seats.", "description": "Speaking time. Restroom proximity.
