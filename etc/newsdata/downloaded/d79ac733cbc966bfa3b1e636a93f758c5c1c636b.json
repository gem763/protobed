There's a bit of demographic challenge around that.'", "description": "Younger generations of Britons are abandoning the classic cup of builder's tea in favour of coffee and herbal brews, the company behind PG Tips has warned.", "authors": ["Matt Oliver For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/01/19864642-0-image-a-115_1571358704222.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
