One thing we\u2019ll look at is building a batting group that can bat long periods of time. Stack runs up and put pressure on.\n\n\u201cIt sounds old fashioned but we\u2019ve got to recognise that we need to look at that. We need the right people in the right places.\n\n\u201cWe want to bat long periods of time and then we want to create a bowling attack that is absolutely relentless and we saw some examples of that this summer. The Aussies made our lives really difficult.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cJoe and I had a good long conversation yesterday. I want to make sure that from the get go, Joe and I are aligned with how we're going to go about taking the Test team forward and these are his thoughts as well.\u201d\n\nSilverwood will have Graham Thorpe and Paul Collingwood as two of his three assistants with a bowling coach yet to be appointed, possibly former England bowler Jon Lewis who has been working with the young Lions.\n\nAnd in a week where players have been in the spotlight once more off the field, Silverwood confirmed that the midnight curfew will remain in place for all players and staff on duty with respect remaining the key word.\n\n\u201cYou want to be successful, but it's how you are successful as well,\u201d he added. \u201cIt's winning in the right spirit of the game. Winning with a little bit of class, and respecting your opposition as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the way you win that helps you become the most respected, keep driving the culture and when we are on the field, we\u2019re role models.\u201d", "description": "England's new coach has been outlining his blueprint to return England to the world's 'most respected' team", "authors": ["Dean Wilson", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20554178.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_ECB-Chris-Silverwood-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
