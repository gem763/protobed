I'm ready to see these boys blossom,\" said Solskjaer, who could be without the injured Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard on Saturday.\n\n\"There's not many clubs with our stature that play the young players that we do. They'll have a chance to come through and we're sure that some of these will be part of a successful team.\"\n\nWhile that approach reaped rich rewards with United's famous Class of '92, Ferguson had already built solid foundations for David Beckham and company to flourish on.\n\nSolskjaer is working on much shakier ground and, with fans quietly seething about the way United owners the Glazer family have allowed the club to spiral into mediocrity, his status as an Old Trafford icon may not be enough to keep the critics at bay for much longer.\n\nCurrently languishing in 10th place in the Premier League after winning just two of their first seven games, United are in desperate need of a morale-boosting victory at St James's Park this weekend.\n\nThey have not scored more than one goal in any game since beating Chelsea on the opening weekend of the season and if they cannot break that sequence against crisis-torn Newcastle the alarm bells will be ringing louder than ever.\n\nSecond-bottom Newcastle have won only once in eight games in all competitions since Steve Bruce took over and last weekend's 5-0 thrashing at Leicester ranked as a low point even for a club of the Magpies' chequered recent history.\n\nFormer United defender Bruce, caught in the middle of a furious feud between Newcastle fans and Magpies owner Mike Ashley, is without a win in 21 meetings with his old club.\n\nAnd despite Solskjaer's woes, it is self-preservation that will be on Bruce's mind when he goes head to head with his fellow United legend.\n\n\"I think I've got enough on my plate to worry about at the moment rather than worry about what Ole's got on his, but I wish him the best of luck,\" Bruce said.\n\nWEEKEND ENGLISH PREMIERSHIP FIXTURES:\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 5\n\nBrighton v Tottenham Hotspur - 13:30\n\nLiverpool v Leicester City - 16:00\n\nNorwich City v Aston Villa - 16:00\n\nBurnley v Everton - 16:00\n\nWatford v Sheffield United - 16:00\n\nWest Ham United v Crystal Palace - 18:30\n\nSUNDAY, OCTOBER 6\n\nArsenal v Bournemouth - 15:00\n\nManchester City v Wolves - 15:00\n\nSouthampton v Chelsea - 15:00\n\nNewcastle United v Manchester United - 17:30", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admits Manchester United are in for a bumpy ride as he tries to rebuild his struggling team.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7831/e8fa0dfca85342b69699792caaddea84.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
