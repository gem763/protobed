Elizabeth Warren topped former Vice President Joe Biden in five of seven national polls released this month \u2014 putting them neck-and-neck after months of Biden leading the pack for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe Massachusetts lawmaker even edged out Biden by 0.2 percentage points \u2014 26.6 to 26.4 \u2014 in the Real Clear Politics national average at one point this week, before Biden took back a 27.8-26 lead with the help of a new Fox News poll released Thursday night.\n\nThe brief slip marked the first time that the Democratic front-runner \u2014 embroiled in controversy over son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine \u2014 was overtaken since surveys about the contest to challenge President Trump began last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was comfortably in second place for most of the year, slipped to a distant third in the RCP average, with just 15.2%.\n\nA weekly Economist/YouGov poll released Wednesday put Warren ahead of Biden by four points, 29-25, while Quinnipiac University had her up by three points, 29-26, on Tuesday.\n\nWarren barely beat Biden by one point, 27-26, in an IBD/TIPP poll released on Oct. 4, and by three points, 28-25, in a Monmouth University poll Oct. 2. The Economist/YouGov poll released on Oct. 2 gave Warren a six-point lead, 28-22.", "description": "The Massachusetts lawmaker even edged out Biden by 0.2 percentage points \u2014 26.6 to 26.4 \u2014 in the Real Clear Politics national average at one point this week,...", "authors": ["Bruce Golding"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT119_warren_ZG_20191011022209.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
