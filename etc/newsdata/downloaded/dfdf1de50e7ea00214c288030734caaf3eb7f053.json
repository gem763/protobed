Learning clicker training took the photographer and her dog down many roads, one of which led to the Canadian National Exhibition stage where Cohen performed with the SuperDogs.\n\nNote: many cute dogs can be found within this video\n\nHow does Jess Bell take the animal photographs that mesmerize the internet? She shows you her process. 5:09\n\nIn this video, Bell shares her technique for capturing the frenetic energy of many different dogs in the photographs that have brought her many devoted fans. She introduces you to Cohen, who, by the way, has been decorated with many awards and has performed in movies and commercials (not to mention the fact that she has a Facebook following many humans might dream about). And Bell opens up about what taking these photos has meant to her \u2014 as an artist, a dog mom and the mother to her young daughter.\n\nFollow Jess Bell here (And you can follow Cohen here.)\n\nStream CBC Arts: Exhibitionists or catch it on CBC Television Friday nights at 11:30pm (12am NT) and Sundays at 3:30pm (4pm NT).
