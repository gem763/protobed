And while Bernie Sanders did use the opportunity to draw a contrast between himself and Biden, pointing out that he\u2019d voted against the war because he had \u201cnever believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq,\u201d Sanders\u2019 criticism continued to let Biden off the hook when it comes to the full history of his record.\n\nFor one, Biden continues to wrongly boil down his role in the Iraq War to his 2002 vote for the war authorization. As I reported for In These Times, Biden was a central figure in leading the march to war.\n\nAs chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden was an influential Democratic voice largely backing President George W. Bush\u2019s calls for regime change in Iraq. As early as February 2002, Biden was telling crowds that \u201cif Saddam Hussein is still there five years from now, we are in big trouble,\u201d that \u201cit would be unrealistic \u2026 to believe we can claim victory in the war on terrorism if Saddam is still in power,\u201d and that \u201cdialogue with Saddam is useless.\u201d\n\nThat July, Biden told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that if the administration could prove Saddam and al-Qaeda were in cahoots, it would justify a pre-emptive war. While a link between the two was fiction, this claim formed a key element of the Bush administration\u2019s case for war.\n\nThat month, Biden held congressional hearings on the subject of invading Iraq. Despite reports that top military brass was uneasy about Bush\u2019s push for war, Biden stacked the hearings with pro-war voices, and opened proceedings by warning that weapons of mass destruction \u201cmust be dislodged from Saddam, or Saddam must be dislodged from power.\u201d Former UN chief weapons inspector Scott Ritter, who, along with other experts critical of the administration\u2019s war narrative, wasn\u2019t invited to testify, warned that \u201cBiden's open embrace of regime removal in Baghdad\u201d could turn the hearings into \u201cpolitical cover\u201d for war.\n\n\u201cWe have no choice but to eliminate the threat,\u201d Biden later told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d of Saddam Hussein, citing the pro-war testimony he had arranged.\n\nThese snapshots illustrate Biden\u2019s leading role in selling the war to the U.S. public. But they also demonstrate he was well aware the Bush administration wasn\u2019t simply planning to send inspectors into Iraq, but rather was set on invading.\n\nIf Biden truly believed that his vote in October 2002 wasn\u2019t meant to pave the way for war, he likely wouldn\u2019t have embarked on a world tour two months later that involved meeting an Iraqi resistance leader in Germany, talking to the King of Jordan, and making pit stops in Israel and Qatar. Nor would he have spoken to the Kurd Parliament in Kurdish-controlled Northern Iraq, telling Saddam\u2019s bitter enemies that the United States would \u201cstand with you in your effort to build a united Iraq.\u201d\n\nNor does Biden\u2019s description of his actions after the war began tell the full story. It\u2019s true that Biden frequently criticized Bush for the way the war was conducted. But Biden was also one of the increasingly lonely Democratic voices insisting that war had been the right decision all along, despite Bush\u2019s bungling of its prosecution.\n\nIn June 2003, Biden told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Tony Snow that \u201cit was a just war.\u201d The next month he said he\u2019d \u201cvote to do it again\u201d and gave remarks to the Brookings Institution in which he charged that \u201canyone who can't acknowledge that the world is better off without [Saddam] is out of touch.\u201d In August, he called for sending 20,000-50,000 more U.S. troops to Iraq. And in a September speech to the National Press Club, he criticized \u201cthe knee-jerk multilateralists in my own party who have not yet faced the reality of the post-9/11 world.\u201d The list goes on.\n\nThe U.S. public must make sure the person they select to be president not only demonstrates wisdom, but also won\u2019t be swept away in a tidal wave of pro-war fervor. By allowing Biden to mislead voters on his Iraq War record, his rivals (and the debate moderators) are doing a disservice to the American public.\n\nWhat do you want to see from our coverage of the 2020 presidential candidates?
