Ukhozi cited misconduct as their reason for firing Ngizwe.\n\nNgizwe told Isolezwe that he won\u2019t take his dismissal lying down and could take legal action against the station. He wasn\u2019t satisfied with the way Ukhozi handled the situation and their reasons for his dismissal.\n\nAs expected, his fans were not happy about his axing from the biggest radio station in the country.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Tbo Touch, DJ Sbu and Gareth Cliff who launched their own radio stations, Ngizwe says he did it for his fans.\n\n\"My fans' requests saddened me. They made me think about what I could do for them. That was when the idea to start an online radio station came up,\" he told the Daily Sun.\n\nNgizwe Mchunu FM will play mostly traditional music. It goes live on Saturday 14 September from 09:00 to 23:00.\n\nLISTEN TO A BIT OF WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM THIS NEW STATION:", "description": "Ngizwe Mchunu FM will play mostly traditional music.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9354/86ed90cf35ac459694f52c46d310d6b4.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
