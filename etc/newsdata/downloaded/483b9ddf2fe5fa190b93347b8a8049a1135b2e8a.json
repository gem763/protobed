There are also no plans for Russian warships to escort oil tankers to the island nation amid a US crackdown.\n\nWhen asked by Rossiya 1 channel about speculations that he and Castro discussed establishing a permanent military foothold in the Caribbean, just 180 km from the US shores, Medvedev was brief.\n\nLet them talk\n\n\u201cWe discussed cooperation, remembered our past, how we met for the first time,\u201d the prime minister said.\n\nHe mentioned that Castro called the US sanctions against Cuba an \u201cincomprehensible childish solution.\u201d The military presence was not brought up, though.\n\nWhile the Soviets never established a permanent base on Cuba, a so-called training brigade was stationed on the island in wake of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. The unit, consisting of Soviet military specialists, was a heavily-guarded secret until 1979, but played more or less symbolic role. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the contingent of 1,500 was withdrawn.\n\nAlso on rt.com Russia vows to develop Cuban energy sector strangled by US blockade\n\nSome Cubans have never stopped hoping for the renewal of military aid from Moscow, and this includes the idea of Russian warships escorting the oil tankers to dodge US sanctions on Cuba and its chief oil supplier, Venezuela. But Medvedev has rejected this idea.\n\nWe\u2019ll find other ways for Cuba to get oil\n\nAs for the economy, Medvedev pointed out that the turnover between Russia and Cuba has significantly increased, just as the Russian investments. Russian companies will be upgrading almost 1,000 km of Cuban railtracks in accordance with the new deal.\n\nAlso on rt.com Khmeimim 2.0: Large-scale renovation at Russia\u2019s airbase in Syria protects jets & allows deployment of even MORE (PHOTOS)\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
