So alarm bells rang last month when it registered its biggest rise in 30 years after supply was reduced by the two attacks.\n\nThey knocked 5 per cent off global supply, but since Brent crude hit just over $69 a barrel in mid-September, it has come back down.\n\nBosdet points out the dynamics of the market have shifted in the past decade. The shale boom in the US has allowed it to become increasingly self-sufficient, producing enough to support the nation's gas-guzzling car drivers.\n\nThat has helped offset the reliance of the world's biggest economy on output from the 14-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), led by Saudi Arabia. Opec production is at its lowest level in eight years.\n\nBosdet watches the oil price for the impact it can have on the price of petrol on forecourts. He cites a rule of thumb that a $2 rise in the price of oil pushes up the price of petrol by 1p.\n\nBut, he says, there are other factors affecting prices at the pump, including gyrations in the pound and retailers' profit margins.\n\nThe oil price certainly matters to Saudi Arabia for another reason: it is said to be planning to sell a stake in its giant Aramco oil company, claimed to be the world's most profitable business.\n\nAs for existing oil shares, many of them are held for their dividends, points out Ian Forrest, investment research analyst at the Share Centre.\n\nShell and BP yield 6.3 per cent and 6.4 per cent respectively, which Forrest says is more than utilities such as National Grid and United Utilities.\n\nHe believes both companies are committed to maintaining their dividends. Ben van Beurden, boss of Shell, recently told the Financial Times that the company wanted to preserve its dividend at the same time as trying to invest in non-fossil fuel areas.\n\nBut Forrest says that from an 'investor's point of view there's no doubt that fossil fuels are going to make up a huge part of their revenues for many years to come.'\n\nThis could be a sticking point for those concerned about ethical and environmental issues.\n\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company last week severed ties with BP following complaints by green lobbyists, just days before BP named insider Bernard Looney, 49 to replace Bob Dudley as chief executive next March.\n\nThe Extinction Rebellion protests have drawn attention to climate change as a major issue for investors as well as everyone else.\n\nD'Ath says that environmental considerations need to be high on the agenda. The move to electric cars \u2013 held back by cost, battery-life and availability of charging points \u2013 is a 'long-term headwind' for the oil price.\n\n'It's difficult to know whether it's 10 years or 20 years. The risk is that it could happen much quicker than the market thinks,' D'Ath says.", "description": "All it needs is a quick glance at an oil price chart to see the volatility over the last ten years.
