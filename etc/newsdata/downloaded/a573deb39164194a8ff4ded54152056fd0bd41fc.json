Down the side guys. No one's coming up,' one climber said.\n\nThe climbers around him applauded and cheered, though the couple pushed on and continued their climb under the glaring stares of the waiting group.\n\nA few more urged the couple to turn back, but they insisted, 'We don't need the chain.'\n\nThe couple finally scaled the summit without injury.\n\nHundreds of people who had lined up since 4am on Friday to climb the 348-metre high landmark raced up the rock at 10am when it was opened for the last time\n\nA local traditional owner, Vincent Forrester, booed at the crowd when they started climbing on Friday.

It was announced in November 2017 that climbing Uluru, considered a sacred site by the local Anangu people, would be banned from October 26, 2019. Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park's board of management, made up of a majority of Aboriginal traditional owners, unanimously decided to close the climb. Traditional owner and board chairman Sammy Wilson said on behalf of the Anangu people it was time to do so. 'We've talked about it for so long and now we're able to close the climb,' Mr Wilson said. 'It's about protection through combining two systems, the government and Anangu. 'This decision is for both Anangu and non-Anangu together to feel proud about; to realise, of course it's the right thing to close it. 'The land has law and culture. We welcome tourists here. Closing the climb is not something to feel upset about but a cause for celebration. Let's come together, let's close it together. 'If I travel to another country and there is a sacred site, an area of restricted access, I don't enter or climb it, I respect it. It is the same here for Anangu. We welcome tourists here. We are not stopping tourism, just this activity.' On 26 October 1985 Uluru and Kata Tjuta - formerly known as the Olgas - were handed back to the Anangu people.\n\nHundreds of people started lining up from 4am on Friday to climb the 348-metre high landmark in Alice Springs.\n\nBut at 7am, when the rock climb usually opens, rangers put up a sign declaring it was closed.\n\nThis was in line with regulations requiring the climb to be closed when strong heat, wind or rain occurs, following numerous deaths at the rock in the past. The wind threshold is 25-30km/hr.\n\nThe climb opened three hours later at 10am by Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park operators.\n\nHundreds of visitors and tourists quickly began moving toward to rock face to make the climb.\n\nA local traditional owner, Vincent Forrester, booed at the crowd.\n\nAt the front of the queue early on Friday morning were Adelaide couple Joseph and Sonita Vinecombe, who flew into the area on Thursday.\n\n'We just got here early, mate,' Mr Vinecombe told AAP.\n\nMr Vinecombe said they were aware of the cultural sensitivities around the climb.\n\n'You want to be respectful, and I do respect the issues regarding it. There's thousands of people doing it and it is a conundrum,' he said.\n\nBehind them were the Derks family, including mother Kelly and her daughters Madison and Georgia, from Victoria.\n\nMadison, 19, was climbing for the second day in a row.\n\n'It was good to climb it, you feel really proud, and you've got to do it while you've got the chance,' she said.\n\nHundreds of visitors and tourists quickly began moving toward to rock face to make the climb (pictured waiting for it to open on Friday morning)\n\nThere were fears Uluru would stay closed on its last day due to high winds, but they died down and rangers eventually opened up the landmark\n\nA mild 33-degree forecast for the area on Friday means the heat will not be an issue for climbers.\n\nThe rush to beat the ban on climbing the rock from Saturday, or crazy 'climb fever' as the Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park ranger in charge Greg Elliot calls it, has shown no signs of abating.\n\nAfter the last of climber comes down on Friday, workers will immediately start removing all evidence climbing was ever allowed on the red sandstone rock, which is arguably Australia's most famous landmark.\n\nThe chain handhold, built in 1964 and later extended, that enables visitors to get up and down the sheer western face of what used to be known as Ayers Rock, will also be removed.\n\nThe National Park board decided in 2017 to ban the climb from this Saturday, which marks 35 years since the land title to the Anangu was given back on October 26, 1985.\n\nUluru is a sacred site and of great spiritual significance to local Aboriginal groups, including the Pitjantjatjara Anangu traditional owners who live in nearby Mutitjulu.\n\nThe Anangu people will celebrate with a ceremony at the rock on Sunday night.\n\nThe scarring from millions of pairs of feet scrambling up the rock for decades will take a long time to erode, possibly hundreds of years or even longer.\n\nA number of tourists have taken to social media and shared extraordinary images of massive lines of people waiting to shuffle up Uluru in the days before the ban is enforced", "description": "Footage showed the furious climbers at Uluru, in the Northern Territory, try to turn back the defiant couple as they made their way up the rock before the closure  on Saturday.", "authors": ["Hannah Moore", "Aidan Wondracz", "Adam Mccleery For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/00/20158974-0-image-a-2_1571960633926.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
