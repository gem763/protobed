But in recent years, governments and mobile spyware companies have begun targeting the devices where the messages were sent or received. The logic goes that if you hack the device, you can obtain its data.\n\nThat\u2019s what WhatsApp says happened.\n\nWhatsApp, owned by Facebook, quickly patched the vulnerability. Although blame fell fast on NSO Group, WhatsApp did not publicly accuse the company at the time \u2014 until now.\n\nIn an op-ed posted shortly after the suit was filed, WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said the messaging giant \u201clearned that the attackers used servers and Internet-hosting services that were previously associated\u201d with NSO Group, and that certain WhatsApp accounts used during the attacks were traced back to the company.\n\n\u201cWhile their attack was highly sophisticated, their attempts to cover their tracks were not entirely successful,\u201d said Cathcart.\n\nThe attack involved disguising the malicious code as call settings, allowing the surveillance outfit to deliver the code as if it came from WhatsApp\u2019s signaling servers. Once the malicious calls were delivered to the target\u2019s phone, they \u201cinjected the malicious code into the memory of the target device \u2014 even when the target did not answer the call,\u201d the complaint read. When the code was run, it sent a request to the surveillance company\u2019s servers, and downloaded additional malware to the target\u2019s device.\n\nIn total, some 1,400 targeted devices were affected by the exploit, the lawsuit said.\n\nMost people were unaffected by the WhatsApp exploit. But WhatsApp said that more than 100 human rights defenders, journalists and \u201cother members of civil society\u201d were targeted by the attack.\n\nOther targets included government officials and diplomats.\n\nIn a statement, NSO Group said: \u201cIn the strongest possible terms, we dispute today\u2019s allegations and will vigorously fight them.\u201d", "description": "WhatsApp has filed a suit in federal court accusing Israeli mobile surveillance maker NSO Group of creating an exploit that was used hundreds of times to hack into target\u2019s phone.
