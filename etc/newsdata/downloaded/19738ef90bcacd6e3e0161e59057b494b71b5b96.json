A neighbour described them as 'a nice couple' who had lived together in the house for between 12 and 18 months\n\nDoran escaped jail this week, much to the anger of her ex Chris Mahone (pictured together when they were engaged) and his friends who lost \u00a311,160 to her scam\n\nDoran (pictured outside Carlisle Crown court this week) stole money from 30 of her fiance's friends that was meant for his stag do and received a 15 month suspended sentence\n\nShe now lives in Egremont, Cumbria, with Ian Flinn, 32, who answered the door of their terraced home in his dressing gown today.\n\nMr Flinn said neither he nor Rachel wished to comment, saying: 'We're alright thanks pal.'\n\nA neighbour described them as 'a nice couple' who had lived together in the house for between 12 and 18 months.\n\nLast month Rachel accompanied Mr Flinn to his brother's 40th birthday party, which he described on social media as a 'brilliant family night.'\n\nDoran is pictured smiling next to Mr Flinn and his brother.\n\nShe was given a 15 month suspended sentence and ordered to pay back \u00a33,600 to Mr Mahone and the 30 stags who had planned to fly to Ibiza.\n\nThe party were left stranded at Leeds Bradford airport because Doran had squandered their cash on herself and sent them to the airport with forged flight documents, which were immediately spotted by Jet2 staff.\n\nOne member of the stag party Glyn Edwards, 33, told Mail Online the sentence shows crime does pay.\n\nMr Edwards said: 'It sounds like being a criminal pays off. If you are looking at the fine she got it was a quarter of what she got away with. No justice was done.\n\n'I imagine she will be paying back a pound a week, we were never asking for that money back anyway.\n\nMr Mahone apologised to his friends in an emotional Facebook post when he realised what his fiancee had done\n\nOne member of the stag party Glyn Edwards, 33, told Mail Online the sentence shows crime does pay.

I trusted her and was getting ready to settle down and spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n'I loved her at the time and I have not been able to move on because I cannot trust anyone else in the way I trusted Rachel.\n\n'I am trying to move on but I find it difficult to talk to women because I am scared of getting hurt.\n\n'My friends are gutted, they don't want the money back, they just want justice done. My friends could have turned on me but they didn't.\n\nIn a victim personal statement Mr Mahone described how his trust in women has been 'shattered'. Nine of the friends decided to go away anyway and booked themselves on a flight to Magaluf to make the best of a bad situation\n\n'I don't want to see Rachel again I just want some closure. Maybe when she has been sentenced I will regain some of my confidence and kickstart my life again.\n\n'I want Rachel to learn from what she has done.'\n\nDoran's barrister Kim Whittlestone told the court that she had begun a new relationship.\n\nSome of the group were unwilling to let Doran wreck their holiday and went away on an impromptu trip to Magaluf\n\nShe said: 'She has started building bridges.
