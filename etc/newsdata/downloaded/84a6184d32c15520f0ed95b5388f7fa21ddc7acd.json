Why? Anti-cheesers say that cheese makes us fat, flares up allergies, produces unwanted mucus, and is unfriendly to the human digestive system.\n\nThough not as forceful as the one against gluten, the anti-cheese crusade is the type where it\u2019s no longer just yogis, vegans, or Brooklyn trendsetters as the driving force behind the uproar; instead, it\u2019s the suburban, 30-something, CrossFit-attending, paleo-Jane\u2019s and Joe\u2019s.\n\nPersuaded heavily by the anti-dairy industry and the plant-based, vegetarian and vegan milk movement (that filtered water mixed with a handful of pulverized nuts); books like the China Study, which suggests that casein protein in milk causes cancer; or viral YouTube videos suggesting how casein is addictive, this sect of anti-fromagers blames cheese as the major culprit for a culture of upset stomachs, skin rashes, low energy-levels, and obesity.", "description": "Cheese isn\u2019t bad for you\u2014it\u2019s just a misunderstood food.", "authors": ["Johnny Adamic"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492122272/articles/2015/10/13/anti-cheese-crusaders-must-be-stopped/151012-adamic-cheese-crusades-tease_e1vqf2", "published_at": "2015-10-13"}
