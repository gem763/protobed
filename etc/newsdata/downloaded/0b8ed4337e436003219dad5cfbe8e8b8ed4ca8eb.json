The local news tracked Zamourka down in Koreatown to reveal who she was: a Russian immigrant who became homeless after a man stole her violin, which was her livelihood, and the musician ended up evicted. Hundreds of people have since donated to online fundraisers to help her get off the streets.\n\nAD\n\nAnd Los Angeles Councilman Joe Buscaino (D), hearing her Italian operatic solo, invited the 52-year-old to perform at the unveiling of the city\u2019s new Little Italy district on Saturday. Then, his office immediately started working on finding her housing, Buscaino\u2019s spokesman, Branimir Kvartuc, told The Washington Post.\n\nAD\n\nZamourka\u2019s tale may seem like a classic L.A. story, Kvartuc said: a gifted performer plucked out of the unlikeliest of places after a chance discovery, \u201clike the American Idol story but on social media.\u201d But where the allure of overnight fame brushes up against the city\u2019s homelessness crisis, Kvartuc said, it gets complicated. He wanted to get Zamourka off the streets in just one night, he said, but as with many of thousands of homeless people in Los Angeles, the transition typically takes much longer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy-peasy saying, \u2018Here\u2019s your new life,\u2019\u201d Kvartuc said. \u201cThe thing is, I have so much more news for her. \u2018You never have to spend another night outside again.\u2019 But I can\u2019t seem to deliver it to her.\"\n\nAD\n\nLate Monday night, he was driving around Koreatown looking for her.\n\nThe outpouring of support was escalating faster than she knew, he said. She had accepted the invitation to perform at Little Italy earlier on Monday, but afterward, Buscaino\u2019s office had come up with a bolder plan: They called back on Monday night, offering to put her up in an Airbnb while they figured out a more permanent place for her to live.\n\nAD\n\nBut when Kvartuc relayed that offer, she seemed hesitant, he said. By 10:30 p.m., he couldn\u2019t reach her.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been overwhelmed with the attention,\u201d Kvartuc said.\n\nImmediately after the LAPD\u2019s video went viral last week, Angelenos wanted to know her story. Some said they had seen her before, playing the violin or singing \u201cAve Maria\u201d on one corner, feeding pigeons on another. Some thought she was too good to be true, supposedly not looking homeless enough while singing opera.\n\nAD\n\nBut then the local news managed to find her.\n\nThey asked her, where did you learn to sing like that? She said she was never classically trained nor did she ever attend music school, but would take any opportunity to sing on a stage.\n\n\u201cYou know why I do it in the subway?\u201d she asked. \u201cBecause it sounds so great. It feels like I\u2019m already there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe said she was born in Russia and came to the United States when she was 24. To make a living, she said she taught violin and piano lessons until she started having health problems, which the news outlets did not specify. Eventually, she turned to street performances with her prized $10,000 violin \u2014 until a few years ago, when it was stolen.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen I lost that,\u201d she told KABC Monday, \u201cI felt like I lost everything.\u201d\n\nIt happened outside a restaurant in downtown Los Angeles, and was in part captured on video. Zamourka had just finished a performance in front of a modest group of fans, when suddenly a man who had been standing in the crowd swooped in and snatched Zamourka\u2019s violin. A friend who was there that night, Whitney Smith, recalled the incident to KABC on Monday.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden I just hear her scream,\u201d Smith said. She said two young men then chased the thief down the street as Smith turned her phone\u2019s camera on to record. \u201cI was standing there with her, saying \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it \u2014 they\u2019re going to get him.\u2019 Well, they did catch up to him, but the guy threw the violin down violently.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVideo footage Smith captured that night showed Zamourka crying over the broken instrument. A man tried to assure her the strings were still attached. Zamourka knew it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cOh, my violin!\u201d she cried in one long sob.\n\nShortly after the theft, Zamourka started sleeping on cardboard, she said, sometimes feeling threatened and scared, looking for shelter wherever she could find it.\n\nNow, she said, \u201cwhat\u2019s happening is something I can\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m speechless,\u201d she told KABC. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a miracle.\u201d\n\nMichael Trujillo, a Los Angeles-based political consultant, was among those watching the story on the local news over the weekend. He created a GoFundMe page for her. \u201cIt was just sort of spur of the moment,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nBy early Tuesday morning, more than 700 people had donated nearly $29,000.\n\nAD\n\nTrujillo said he contacted the Downtown Women\u2019s Center to see if they might use the money on Zamourka\u2019s behalf to provide services and help her find long-term housing. (The center declined to comment, citing privacy rules.) \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of trying to do this in a way she\u2019s comfortable with,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Monday night, Trujillo explained his plan to Kvartuc, just as the councilman\u2019s spokesman set out to find Zamourka.\n\nKvartuc grew frustrated as his search turned fruitless, like he couldn\u2019t wait another hour to assure Zamourka that her nights on the streets could end.\n\n\u201cShe has earned this already,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she knows it yet.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Hundreds have donated nearly $29,000, enough to house the former violinist and buy her a new instrument.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AAjqGdUqk9mdxfMzZ8dWmksMGeY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DJJFIO2THREZJPWK6YEKQIZACU.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
