The Congress did.\"\n\nHarper Neidig contributed.", "description": "President Trump's top trade official has declined to testify before a key House\u00a0panel about the administration's efforts to\u00a0include controversial language protecting internet platforms from legal liability in trade agreements, according", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/lighthizerrobert_072618am4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
