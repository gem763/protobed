You don't need to concentrate to walk, you can just look forward and step. You don't need to look at where your leg is to avoid falling.'\n\nProfessor Stanisa Raspopovic, who led the study from ETH Zurich said: 'When prosthetics do not work properly, people fall and suffer severe injuries.\n\nThe leg (pictured) has been found to work three people with above-the-knee amputations, who were able to climb stairs 30 per cent faster and avoid tripping over unseen obstacles\n\nThe electrodes in the leg pick up Bluetooth electrical signals created from seven sensors in the prosthetic foot and one in the knee, to detect the angle it bends (it is unclear who is pictured)\n\n'These electrodes may require less effort to control a leg, because it feels like part of someone's own body, which give people the confidence they need to walk more efficiently.'\n\nHOW DOES THE PROSTHETIC WORK? The holy grail for scientists making prosthetic legs, arms and hands is for those who use them to be able to feel their movements. But they have made only limited progress using electrodes attached to people's stumps, and no feeling has previously been restored in people with amputations above the knee, who have lost important nerves in the lower leg. The new breakthrough succeeded by embedding electrodes only a little larger than a human hair into the tibial nerve in the thigh - the first time this has been done. The electrodes pick up Bluetooth electrical signals created from seven sensors in the prosthetic foot and one in the knee, to detect the angle it bends. These allowed amputees to walk over an uneven surface, stepping on plastic rocks up to seven centimetres (2.8 inches) high while wearing glasses which prevented them looking down to avoid them.\n\nThe holy grail for scientists making prosthetic legs, arms and hands is for those who use them to be able to feel their movements.\n\nBut they have made only limited progress using electrodes attached to people's stumps, and no feeling has previously been restored in people with amputations above the knee, who have lost important nerves in the lower leg.\n\nThe new research succeeded by embedding electrodes only a little larger than a human hair into the tibial nerve in the thigh - the first time this has been done.\n\nThe electrodes pick up Bluetooth electrical signals created from seven sensors in the prosthetic foot and one in the knee, to detect the angle it bends.\n\nThese allowed amputees to walk over an uneven surface, stepping on plastic rocks up to seven centimetres (2.8 inches) high while wearing glasses which prevented them looking down to avoid them.\n\nResearchers led by technological university ETH Zurich, whose work is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, found people slipped and had to grip or lean on a handrail 40 per cent of the time when the electrodes were turned off.\n\nBut they stumbled only five per cent of the time when the electrodes were on and they could feel the plastic rocks under their feet.\n\nThe three men in the study, who had all lost large parts of their legs in traffic accidents, could climb a flight of five stairs 30 per cent faster using the leg (it is unclear who is pictured)\n\nBrain recordings showed walking, which is usually very difficult with an artificial leg, took no more effort than sitting, while in a questionnaire people said the leg felt more like their own (it is unclear who is pictured)\n\nThe three men in the study, who had all lost large parts of their legs in traffic accidents, could climb a flight of five stairs 30 per cent faster using the technology.\n\nBrain recordings showed walking, which is usually very difficult with an artificial leg, took no more effort than sitting, while in a questionnaire people said the leg felt more like their own.\n\nThey were able to feel sensations including pressure, vibration and tingling in 27 different areas of their leg and foot.\n\nExperts say embedding electrodes in a nerve, rather than just wrapping them around it, allows more feeling from different parts of the leg.\n\nDr Ben Metcalfe, a neural engineering expert from the University of Bath, said: 'The technology in this work is approaching a like-for-like leg replacement, rather than simply a mechanical stump.\n\n'This will transform the way that we repair injury, using bioelectronic technology to access the body's information highways and restore functionality.'\n\nDr Bryce Dyer, an expert in biomedical engineering from Bournemouth University, said: 'This could be important in the future as it would allow us to design more effective artificial limbs which are better for everyday tasks and reduce the chances of an accident.'", "description": "Amputees cannot feel the prosthetics currently given to them, so are at constant risk of falling.
