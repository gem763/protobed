FBI agents had infiltrated Keebler\u2019s group and built him the bomb, which fizzled.\n\nKeebler\u2019s supporters have previously told FOX 13 they believed he had been set up by the federal government.\n\n\"It was an investigative decision to capture that conversation after he thought he had detonated that explosive - to undercut that, to show folks this was not our concoction. This was his will. This is what he wanted to do. In his very own words, he expressed that,\" said Eric Barnhart, Utah's FBI Special Agent in Charge.\n\nThe judge said Keebler\u2019s myriad health issues, including a heart condition and prostate cancer, was a consideration in not giving him more prison time.\n\nKeebler is likely to return home to Tooele County Monday afternoon.", "description": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 The leader of a Utah militia group is being released from jail Thursday after he pleaded guilty on charges related to the attempted bombing of Bureau of Land Management building on the Utah-Arizona border.", "authors": ["David Wells", "Scott Mckane", "Ben Winslow"], "top_image": "https://localtvkstu.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/promo355424917.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2018-07-09"}
