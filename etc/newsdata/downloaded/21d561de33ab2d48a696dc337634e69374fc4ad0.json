It was estimated that there are 534 fewer detectives than needed, he said.\n\nThe province was in the process of setting up committees to address the criminal and social aspects of crime, but in the meantime, was consulting the Constitution to see whether it was possible for the Western Cape legislature to take control of the South African Police Service in the province.\n\nIn the meantime, police officers were doing the best they can, and many were going out of their way and above the call of duty to serve the province, Winde said.\n\nArmy battalions, currently in barracks in Cape Town, have not yet been served deployment papers to go into 10 identified gang-ridden neighbourhoods yet, Brigadier General Mafi Mgobozi told News24 on Wednesday night.\n\nThis after Cele announced last Thursday during his budget vote speech that the army would descend upon areas in the Cape Flats \"within 12 hours\" of his speech.\n\nThe troops will only be deployed once the paperwork is in order.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
