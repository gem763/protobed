Dominic Lorrimer\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a major issue, but you could perceive a conflict where a manager is doing everything \u2014 both managing the money and acting as market maker \u2014 and you could ask whether prices are therefore being set fairly and reasonably,\u201d Mr Vynokur told The Australian Financial Review.\n\nMore so than conflict mitigation, or even trying to increase transparency, Mr Vynokur suggested ASIC\u2019s intervention on active ETFs is mostly about quality control.\n\n\u201cMost capable active managers are now thinking about [launching] an ETF,\u201d he said. \u201cWhilst the current set of rules are robust, ETFs is a specialist area and you have fund managers who are not specialists viewing an exchange as just another distribution strategy.\u201d\n\nOf the $56.2 billion total ETF market capitalisation in Australia, BetaShares estimates that $3.7 billion is now in actively managed products.\n\nMr Vynokur said ASIC has done a \u201ccommendable\u201d job in ensuring the floodgates are not opened entirely to fund managers seeking an active ETF option, some of which he said have investment strategies without the appropriate liquidity profile to be listed on an exchange.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInternational inspiration\n\nMr Vynokur believes there are legitimate reasons why an active manager, especially a top-performing one like Magellan, would be hesitant to disclose its portfolio to an external market maker. To do so could effectively turn its most lucrative asset, its intellectual property, into a publicly viewable index.\n\nBut he also suggested there are a number of ways transparency can be enhanced without giving away its trade secrets.\n\nOne is to ensure structural separation between the money manager and market maker. For example, BetaShares acts as market maker for the five active ETFs in the market, while AMP Capital and Legg Mason run the portfolios for three and five of the products respectively.\n\nAnother alternative may lie in adopting models being experimented with overseas, such as an increasingly common practice in Canada of active managers disclosing portfolios to external market makers under a formal non-disclosure agreement, without disclosing publicly to the broader market.\n\nASIC has also flagged \u201crecent international developments\u201d including new regulatory frameworks for active ETFs in Hong Kong and the US as one of the factors in its decision to order the pause.\n\nA consultation is under way with market participants and the pause is expected to last for the remainder of the 2019 calendar year.", "description": "Is ASIC's temporary suspension on the $3.7 billion active exchange traded fund market just a routine reset or a sign it has serious concerns?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.378%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_505%2C$y_183/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3926989164aea38f5ed28843da65a3de9fdf4f5a", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
