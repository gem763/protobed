The Saudi officials behind the brutal slaying had planned everything meticulously. He would disappear without a trace.\n\nThe killers wanted nothing to disturb their boss\u2019s ambitious reform drive at home. The young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was trying to transform his country. He had spent the past two years courting the international community as part of his grand vision to modernise the Kingdom and attract foreign investment. He gave Saudis new freedoms, but he also cracked down harder than ever on dissent.\n\nHundreds of millions of dollars were spent on promoting Bin Salman and his reforms. A vast global public relations offensive courted world leaders and celebrities.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnd it appeared to be working \u2013 up until Khashoggi disappeared. When it emerged that the dissident journalist had been murdered inside the Saudi consulate, likely on behalf of the crown prince, that carefully crafted image was ruined, and Bin Salman found himself in the centre of a global scandal that threatened to derail all of his plans.\n\nThis army of public relations firms were now faced with an impossible task: to save the image of a man whom many now regarded as a brutal murderer. One year on from Khashoggi\u2019s killing, they may just have done it.\n\n*****\n\nThe fallout from the Khashoggi killing was unexpected, but Bin Salman\u2019s vast PR network was already on a war footing when the scandal broke.\n\nA year earlier, the Saudi information ministry announced a global campaign \u201cto promote the changing face of KSA to the rest of the world\u201d. This network of lobbyists and public relations experts had been working furiously to counter bad press from Saudi Arabia\u2019s devastating war in Yemen and its blockade of Qatar. Most of it, however, was working to promote MBS.\n\nIn early 2018, the crown prince embarked on a high profile media tour of the US \u2013 billed as a coming out party after assuming de-facto leadership of Saudi Arabia from his father. He held meetings with President Donald Trump, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, Hollywood stars, Wall Street financiers and Oprah Winfrey, to name a few. He appeared on the flagship news programme 60 Minutes for a sitdown interview, and attracted faint praise from columnists in the New York Times.\n\nThat trip was followed by a similarly loud visit to London. PR agencies took out full page adverts in national newspapers, and paid for giant billboards across the city announcing the visit. Industry insiders said that campaign could have cost as much as \u00a31 million.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The kingdom also hired a host of London firms, including Consulum, largely staffed by former employees of Bell Pottinger, and Freud\u2019s.\n\nThe aim was \u201cto present an image of KSA as striding towards reform, detoxify the government to reduce international political pressure, attract investment for economic growth, and open up foreign tourism,\u201d says Professor Hardy.\n\nBut not everyone was convinced. Many saw the PR push as just that, including Khashoggi himself. Nikita Bernardi, a PR consultant who works on human rights cases in the Middle East, remembers discussing the prince\u2019s plans with Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cHe and I were having this conversation in the days before his killing,\u201d she says. \u201cAlmost exactly a year ago I was in Washington DC organising a conference, the aim of which was to question this new face of Saudi Arabia they were trying to promote. Jamal Khashoggi was one of the speakers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe PR campaign felt so extremely superficial. It was almost designed for Western countries that needed him to look more palatable so that they can continue the status quo and sell arms and the rest of it. They needed him to look like he was changing things in the right direction.\u201d\n\nAt the very moment Khashoggi was airing his doubts about whether the crown prince was really a true reformer \u2013 in private and in public \u2013 Bin Salman\u2019s top advisors were plotting to kill him.\n\nKhashoggi went missing on 2 October after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. He had gone there to collect papers so that he could marry his fiancee, who waited for him outside. He was never seen again.\n\nSaudi Arabia initially insisted that Khashoggi had left the consulate, but after a steady stream of leaks by Turkish investigators, it changed the story, saying the 59-year-old was killed there in a \u201cfist fight\u201d.\n\nTurkish and international investigators later said that Khashoggi was murdered inside the consulate and his body disposed of. Agnes Callamard, the UN special rapporteur leading an independent human rights inquiry into the killing, said the murder was \u201cplanned and perpetrated by Saudi officials\u201d.\n\nBut the trail of evidence led all the way to Bin Salman himself. The CIA and some western countries believe the crown prince ordered the killing \u2013 something he has continued to deny.\n\nIn trying to silence Khashoggi, his murderers had the opposite effect. The journalist\u2019s disappearance sparked a firestorm that engulfed the crown prince. Donald Trump, who had been close to Bin Salman, described the attempts to deny the killing as the \"worst in the history of cover-ups.\"\n\nThe murder derailed the crown prince\u2019s carefully crafted rebrand. In the weeks that followed, as the crown prince was directly accused of involvement, a number of companies and leaders distanced themselves from the kingdom. London-based Freud\u2019s and Pagefield Global Counsel announced they were no longer working with the country, in addition to Milltown Partners, which was run by a former head of communications for Prince Charles.\n\nPR Week reported that Gladstone Place Partners, Glover Park Group, BGR, Portland Communications, and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher all ended their work for the Saudi government.\n\nBut though the kingdom lost much of its PR strength, the firms that stuck around \u201cwent into overdrive,\u201d Ben Freeman, who tracks foreign influence for the Center for International Policy, told the Washington Post.\n\nThose firms included Qorvis Communications, a US-based crisis communications company, and its parent company, MSL, which has worked with the Saudi government for nearly two decades. According to the Washington Post, MSL has received more than $18 million from the Saudi government since October 2018.\n\nThe Saudi government also signed a new $120,000-a-month contract with Karv Communications earlier this year, according to the Financial Times, to \u201cenhance the reputation and image\u201d of the country\u2019s Public Investment Fund, which is headed by Bin Salman.\n\nWith the crown prince under suspicion for the killing, the strategy of the PR firms changed, according to Professor Hardy. The incessant focus on MBS was replaced by more targeted persuasion.\n\n\u201cThe Saudi government sent out senior envoys to persuade key figures in media, politics and business of the sincerity of the investigation into the killing, and slow, discrete work to stabilise and rebuild confidence,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe are currently seeing a multi-pronged effort. KSA is investing in \u2018soft power\u2019 influence such as sports and tourism. Efforts to influence wider public perceptions through such things as sports investment have led to the charge of sportswashing,\u201d he says.\n\nProfessor Hardy points to the upcoming boxing rematch between Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz for the world heavyweight title that will be held in the kingdom.\n\nOn Friday, just days ahead of the anniversary of Khashoggi\u2019s killing, the government announced a new tourist visa programme for 49 countries.\n\nAnd yet, one year after Khashoggi\u2019s murder, the crown prince is making a return to the spotlight. On Saturday, Bin Salman appeared on 60 Minutes again. In the interview, he denied any personal involvement in the killing.\n\n\"This was a heinous crime,\" he said. \"But I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\"\n\n\"I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch,\" he said.\n\nBernardi, the PR consultant, says the interview marks a new strategy.\n\n\u201cThere is only so much that could have been done to protect his reputation. The damage was so great. In the whole year since Jamal has died you can see how the Saudi story has changed. First it was deny deny deny, then they said it was rogue agents, now we have the crown prince saying \u2018it happened under my watch\u2019.\u201d\n\nThat is a very PR line. To me that sounds like something that was thought about and rehearsed. It\u2019s just empty words. What are you taking responsibility for? Absolutely nothing Nikita Bernardi, PR consultant\n\n\u201cThat is a very PR line. To me that sounds like something that was thought about and rehearsed. It\u2019s just empty words. What are you taking responsibility for? Absolutely nothing.\u201d\n\nAgnes Callamard, the UN\u2019s expert on summary executions whose investigation found \u201ccredible evidence\u201d linking the crown prince to the murder, told Reuters that his remarks amount to a \"strategy of rehabilitation in the face of public outrage around the world\".\n\n\"He is creating a distance between himself, he is exonerating himself from direct criminal responsibility in the killing. He is creating layers, and layers and layers of actors and institutions which are protecting him from his direct accountability for the killing.\"\n\nThere are signs, however, that the international community has already moved on from the killing and is perfectly happy to let the crown prince back into the fold. After initially linking Bin Salman to the murder, the Trump administration has made it clear that it would not impact the US-Saudi relationship in any meaningful way.\n\nNext year, Saudi Arabia will host the G20 summit in Riyadh, where Bin Salman is likely to take centre stage. But while states will likely continue to do business with Saudi Arabia, it is unlikely that the crown prince\u2019s image will ever fully recover.\n\n\u201cMBS has used a wide range of tactics to soften his image in light of the murder, including expensive PR campaigns, publicity stunts and modest social reforms,\u201d says Yahya Assiri, director of ALQST, an organisation that documents and promotes human rights in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cBut such attempts have largely been undercut by Saudi Arabia\u2019s ever worsening human rights record, including the detention and targetting of dissidents, systematic torture, mass executions, and a lack of accountability for Jamal Khashoggi.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have seen increasing international pressure on Saudi Arabia, including two landmark joint statements at the UN, a US house resolution and a UK court ruling.\n\n\"While these measures have not always been sufficiently followed up by respective governments, and clearly much further pressure is needed, the time for business as usual is over.\u201d", "description": "The murder of Jamal Khashoggi was supposed to be quiet.
