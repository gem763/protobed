But the comedian was canned on Monday before ever making an appearance on the show.\n\n\"After talking with Shane Gillis, we have decided that he will not be joining SNL,\" an spokesperson said in a statement on behalf of producer Lorne Michaels.\n\nThe statement explained that Gillis' prior remarks were unknown to Michaels, who hired him \"on the strength of his talent as comedian and his impressive audition.\"\n\n\"We want SNL to have a variety of voices and points of view within the show ... The language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable. We are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to our standard.\"\n\nFollowing the announcement of his dismissal, Gillis responded over Twitter, \"It feels ridiculous for comedians to be making serious public statements but here we are.\"\n\n\"I'm a comedian who was funny enough to get on SNL. That can't be taken away,\" he said. \"Of course, I wanted an opportunity to prove myself at SNL but it would be too much of a distraction. I respect the decision they made. I am honestly grateful for the opportunity.\"\n\nA now-viral video posted by comedy reporter Seth Simons, first brought Gillis' controversial past to the mainstream, though some have distanced themselves from his particular brand of comedy for some time.\n\nIn the video \u2014 an excerpt of Matt and Shane's Secret Podcast, which Gillis co-hosts with comedian Matt McCusker \u2014 he uses a racist slur and makes fun of Chinese accents during a discussion about Chinatown.\n\nIn another episode, he uses gay slurs to describe comedians he doesn't think are funny.\n\nGillis' dismissal follows days of public outcry calling for his removal from the cast, which ironically was announced on the same day SNL hired its first cast member of East Asian descent.\n\nGillis had attempted to mitigate the controversy in a tweet last Thursday writing, \"I'm a comedian who pushes boundaries. I sometimes miss.\"\n\n\"I'm happy to apologize to anyone who's actually offended by anything I've said. My intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks,\" he explained.\n\nOn Monday, Gillis ended his statement saying, \"I was always a [Mad TV] guy anyway.\"", "description": "The comedian's rising star has dimmed in a controversy over a series of derogatory statements he made on his podcast.
