He was in every way a perfect officer of the law, and only when he chanced to stroll past the Plaza hotel did he reveal aspirations that set him apart from his fellow officers. Much to the amusement of his colleagues, Maple would peer through the windows of the Oak Bar and announce that he would someday join the men in suits and ties who laughed and drank on the other side of the plate glass.", "description": "Jack Maple was a New York City cop with champagne taste and a beer wallet.
