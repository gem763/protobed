Finally the second largest crypto asset on the planet appears to be moving without the influence of its big brother dictating things. ETH prices are on the up again today and the fundamentals keep improving.\n\nEthereum Golden Cross\n\nIt has been another good day for Ethereum prices which have finally reached the psychological $200 level after a month trading below it. A dip back to the 50 hour moving average just below $190 yesterday was short lived as price quickly bounced back.\n\nThe move back to just below $200 is the highest Ethereum has traded at since this time last month. A slight pullback has dropped ETH to $197 at the time of writing and it needs to break this barrier before its next leg up.\n\nA golden cross is clearly visible on the four hour chart as the faster 50 MA crosses above the slower moving 200. This is a bullish trend reversal signal and is usually followed by a rally. However, one analyst has noted that total market capitalization has not increased indicating that no new money is flowing into ETH yet.\n\n\u201cETH is up but total crypto market cap still staying flat, price increase could just be money being moved around from other crypto\u2019s rather than fresh money. Waiting for TMC to pass $260B\u201d\n\nETH is up but total crypto market cap still staying flat, price increase could just be money being moved around from other crypto\u2019s rather than fresh money.

At the moment the rest of the altcoins are flat or in the red but the possibility of an ETH decoupling will be strengthened if it can break the $200 barrier.\n\nBitPay Adds Support\n\nNews that crypto payments provider, BitPay has finally added Ethereum support is also bullish. In a press release the company said businesses can accept Ethereum for purchases without the need for any integration or enhancements. Originally only BTC, BCH and a few stablecoins were available on the platform.\n\nEthereum godfather Vitalik Buterin was pleased with the announcement, adding.\n\n\u201cIt is exciting to see BitPay leading the way in integrating Ethereum into global payment systems. This truly opens up a new world of possibilities for the Ethereum ecosystem, and together we can continue to be a leading innovator for real world use cases for cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nThe news adds to other bullish fundamentals for Ethereum such as Santander\u2019s $20 million bond on the blockchain last week, further developments in the DeFi ecosystem for DAI, and a successful network test of ETH 2.0 clients.\n\nImage from Shutterstock", "description": "This week has been all about Ethereum.
