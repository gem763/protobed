Aligning the policy closer to current tattoo trends also allows the Coast Guard to increase the pool of otherwise-qualified potential applicants,\u201d the service said in a statement.\n\nThe new rules say tattoos and/or brand logos may not be visible above the collar of the Coast Guard\u2019s Operational Dress Uniform\u2019s crew neck T-shirt.\n\nOne finger tattoo per hand is permitted however, to be situated between the first knuckle and second knuckle. One ring tattoo per hand remains authorized, but no tattoos are authorized on the thumbs.\n\nA single one-inch tattoo per hand is authorized on the hand between the wrist and the base of the finger. No tattoos are authorized on the palms though.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to see the Coast Guard\u2019s new tattoo policy reinforces a professional appearance to the public while adopting some of the very same tattoo standards that are now acceptable among the public,\u201d said Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard Jason Vanderhaden. \u201cThe new tattoo policy will expand our recruiting candidate pool and provide those already serving in the Coast Guard with a few new options.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
