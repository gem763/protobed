A mysterious but celebrated musician starts an inclusive, exclusive queer club night in New York City, but the Queen Bee of the Moment doesn\u2019t have an invite? How could it be? That\u2019s one secret I\u2019ll never tell. XOX \u2014 you get it, right? Tonight, Frank Ocean\u2019s first-ever queer club night, PrEP+, begins. PrEP+, which is technically attributed to Ocean\u2019s creative brand Blonded and takes its name from the HIV-prevention drug pre-exposure prophylaxis, pays \u201chomage to what could have been of the 1980s\u2019 NYC club scene if the drug \u2026 had been invented in that era,\u201d per a press release obtained by Pitchfork. House rules include: zero tolerance for discrimination, consent is mandatory, dance floor is for dancing, and no photos or videos allowed. Ocean is currently working on a nightlife-inspired album, which may explain his sudden need to be Ian Schrager. Only those who have tickets will be told the club night\u2019s location. And if you don\u2019t have one yet \u2026 oops. Tickets have apparently already been distributed.
