(Jim Young/Reuters)\n\nAfter backing himself into a political corner, the president chose the only palatable way out: executive overreach.\n\nThe president\u2019s decision to declare a national emergency at the southern border was an act of weakness, not strength.\n\nI understand that\u2019s not the party line, but it\u2019s an obvious political fact. When Barack Obama used his pen to give \u201cDreamers\u201d a reprieve from prosecution, it was an act of weakness, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPowerful presidents enact their agendas through Congress, not executive orders. It\u2019s why they usually manage to get their big-ticket items passed shortly after an election, when they can declare a mandate. Executive orders aren\u2019t as lasting because they can be overruled by Congress and future presidents.\n\nPresident Trump declared an emergency in part to conceal his weakness. The bipartisan deal to provide even less funding for border security than what was offered to the White House before the shutdown was an unadulterated defeat for the president. If Trump hadn\u2019t declared a national emergency the same day he signed the legislation, all of the headlines would reflect that. It was an effective way of changing the subject.\n\nIt\u2019s also grotesque.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, the White House has better legal arguments than many of Trump\u2019s most vociferous opponents claim. Since the National Emergencies Act of 1976 was signed by Gerald Ford, there have been 58 national emergencies declared under the law, and 31 of them are still in effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump noted in his Rose Garden announcement, \u201cthere\u2019s rarely been a problem\u201d with past emergency declarations. \u201cThey sign it; nobody cares. I guess they weren\u2019t very exciting. But nobody cares. They sign it for far less important things in some cases \u2014 in many cases.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s the point. Most emergency declarations haven\u2019t been very exciting, precisely because they were uncontroversial, dealing mostly with such things as narrow sanctions on international crime.\n\nUnder a different emergency power, President Obama declared a national emergency in 2009 to combat the swine flu. The logic was that Obama needed flexibility to act quickly, without waiting for Congress, and was based on the assumption that if Congress were capable of acting quickly, it would have approved the measure.\n\nThat\u2019s not the situation here. Congress did act. In a bipartisan vote, it expressed its will on what should \u2014 and should not \u2014 be done at the border.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president could have vetoed the deal, shutting down the government for a second time. But he didn\u2019t. Instead, Trump signed the legislation, then announced that he was unilaterally going to do what he wanted to do anyway.\n\nI don\u2019t like the legislation, and I certainly do not blame Trump for disliking it. But that\u2019s beside the point. Congress had spoken.\n\nThe president\u2019s formal justification is that the situation at the border is a national-security emergency requiring a military response. But as constitutional lawyer (and my National Review colleague) David French pointed out, our border arrangement with Mexico is a civilian enterprise.\n\nThe border wall isn\u2019t a military fortification, and the border is policed by civilian agents. Crime prevention in the U.S. is not a military mission. \u201cThe president waving his hands and citing \u2018national security\u2019 doesn\u2019t change any of these facts,\u201d French wrote.\n\nTrump even admitted that the whole thing is a farce, that it\u2019s not really an emergency. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to do this,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Peter Alexander, \u201cbut I\u2019d rather do it much faster.\u201d You could almost hear the cheers ringing out from all the lawyers gearing up to challenge this in court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll the emergency-power laws that Congress has passed over the decades give the executive branch powers it should not have. But with a few exceptions, they\u2019ve been more annoying than dangerous. Not so here.\n\nTrump has decided that not getting a political win from Congress justifies the use of monarchical powers to deploy the military on U.S. soil. It is, flatly, an abuse of power.\n\nThe fact that so many Republican members of Congress are fine with it is further evidence that both Congress and the Republican party have become a nest of capons \u2014 and even weaker than that strutting rooster in the Rose Garden.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency LLC\n\nSomething to Consider If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.
