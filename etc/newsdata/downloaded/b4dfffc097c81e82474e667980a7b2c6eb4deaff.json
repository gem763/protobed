Michael Horowitz released a scorching report on Comey, who leaked memos to a friend who later gave them to The New York Times. This was done to get a special counsel appointed to head off an investigation into Trump-Russia collusion. Comey said that these documents were his personal journals, not the property of the FBI. These documents detailed meetings he had with President Trump. These are highly sensitive documents which he decided to leak. These aren\u2019t journals, sir. And Comey probably knew that. While he was referred by the DOJ IG, the Justice Department didn\u2019t pull the trigger in bringing formal charges (via Washington Times):\n\nJustice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz said Wednesday that he referred former FBI Director James B. Comey for criminal prosecution this year after concluding he leaked sensitive materials to a friend. And the Justice Department watchdog told Congress he would \u201cassess\u201d Republican allegations of inconsistent statements in Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony before the Senate. Mr. Horowitz\u2019s disclosure that he made the criminal referral marks his first public statement about the criticism lodged against Mr. Comey in a report released last summer. He told lawmakers it is standard practice to make a criminal referral when wrongdoing is suspected. \u201cWe are required by the [Inspector General] Act to send information that we\u2019ve identified that could plausibly be criminal to the Department of Justice,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said. The Justice Department ultimately decided not to prosecute Mr. Comey despite the conclusion by Mr. Horowitz\u2019s team that he improperly leaked information to the news media. The documents leaked by Mr. Comey were sensitive but not classified.\n\nJames Comey purposefully leaked a memo so the special counsel could investigate the President.\n\n\n\nJames Comey relied on a bogus dossier to spy on an American citizen.\n\n\n\nJames Comey owes the country an apology.\n\n\n\n?? : @RepMarkMeadows pic.twitter.com/tRfcrLr2lv \u2014 Oversight Committee Republicans (@GOPoversight) September 18, 2019\n\nComey has become a hated figure on both sides. Democrats are still mad at him for reopening the Hillary Clinton email probe weeks before Election Day. Republicans are infuriated over the fact that despite an excoriating press conference in July 2016, where he outlined a pattern of irresponsible behavior by Clinton and her staff concerning the handling of classified information relating to her unauthorized server which she used for all official business while serving as secretary of state\u2014the FBI declined to bring formal charges. He found enemies on both sides of the river and ended up dead. Yet, this also kills the second tier of the \u201cget Trump\u201d campaign waged by the Left.\n\nBesides the Russian collusion myth, there\u2019s the obstruction of justice bit, which started as soon as Comey was fired for cause. It\u2019s all outlined by former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2019s letter on the matter. Comey was fired in May of 2017. And based on what we know about his actions in the twilight of his career at the FBI\u2014Trump was well within his right to dismiss his FBI chief.\n\nAnd on a side note, criminally referred for leaking sensitive material while he looked into Clinton for doing the same.
