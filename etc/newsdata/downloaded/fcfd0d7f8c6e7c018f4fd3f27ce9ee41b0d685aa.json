The convictions included one count of sexual penetration and four counts of committing indecent acts.\n\nThe verdict was kept secret from the public until February, when additional charges of sexual offences against Pell were withdrawn by prosecutors.\n\nThe Australian cleric filed his application in the High Court of Australia on Tuesday.\n\nIn his failed first appeal, Pell asserted that the guilty verdict had relied unreasonably on the testimony of one victim. His second victim died of a drug overdose in 2014.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'The little people have won': Activists react to Cardinal Pell losing his first appeal last month\n\nThe grounds for his latest appeal bid have not been made public.\n\nPell's conviction has rocked the Catholic Church, where he had been one of Pope Francis's closest advisers.\n\nHe was demoted from the Pope's inner circle last year, but the Vatican continues to face calls for Pell to be defrocked.\n\nPell will be eligible for parole in October 2022.", "description": "Ex-Vatican treasurer George Pell asks Australia's top court to review his sexual abuse convictions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14783/production/_108834838_621b76e7-3942-4005-a478-4b9fd41e7ae4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
