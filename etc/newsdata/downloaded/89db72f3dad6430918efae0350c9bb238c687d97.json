When my first son was born in 2014, I decided (at the last minute) that daycare costs weren't worth the stress of a longer commute, and I quit my job. Thankfully, after downsizing homes, my husband's salary was enough to keep us afloat.\n\nBut if I wanted spending money, I had to come up with it on my own \u2014 so I started putting my pricey English degree to work by writing and editing for friends. Five years later, I'm earning a full salary.\n\nWhile I'm thankful for my work as a freelance writer, I had to carve out my own career path by myself \u2014 which means I've made my fair share of financial mistakes.\n\nI may have done things a little differently had someone told me about the best ways to manage my money \u2014 and my taxes \u2014 as a freelancer. Here's what I'd recommend to anyone who's just starting the self-employment journey.\n\nPay your quarterly taxes\n\nLike other self-employed workers, I owe about 15% of my income to the IRS. In the beginning of my career, I spent all my freelance paychecks when I got them, failing to set aside money for (or even think about) taxes. Then, tax season would come, and I'd be shocked to discover I owed the federal government thousands of dollars.\n\nTo make filing much less complicated, I pay quarterly taxes throughout the year. It's a bit of a buzzkill to lose money immediately after getting paid, but setting money aside in a savings account each month and handing it over when the time comes both prevents surprises and pesky interest fees on payment plans later on.\n\nSet up a short-term payment plan when needed\n\nWhile I make an effort to get ahead of my taxes, there have been years when other expenses \u2014 car repairs, home maintenance, medical bills \u2014 have taken priority over quarterly estimates.\n\nIn those cases, I've still owed money, and sometimes, a lot of it. Thankfully, the IRS has a fairly convenient payment plan system for individuals who can't pay the lump sum they owe all at once.\n\nThere is, of course, a caveat: While there's no set-up fee for those who can pay their full balance in fewer than 120 days, a longer-term plan will run anywhere from $30 to $150 in fees, depending on how you pay. Thankfully, interest rates are fairly low at 3%.\n\nHire an experienced CPA\n\nThe first year I freelanced, I had worked half the year for my old employer and the other half for myself, which made my taxes somewhat complicated.\n\nI tried to use TurboTax to file on my own, but I couldn't believe the amount I owed. Rather than risking paying too much or too little, I consulted with a CPA who specializes in self-employed taxpayers and small businesses. Hiring a CPA came with a cost, but she was able to apply credits and write-offs I didn't think of, ultimately saving me money.\n\nHire a financial planner\n\nMy husband and I may have two incomes now that I have steady writing work, but that doesn't mean my income is as predictable as his.\n\nBecause freelancing has slow and busy months, and every client has different payment terms, it can be somewhat difficult to plan out a budget. Working with a financial adviser to manage our income has encouraged us to think long-term about our taxes and investments.\n\nReady to hire a financial planner?

Now, I track spending down to work-related car mileage.", "description": "Going full-time freelance has been great for this mom of two young kids, but she has four pieces of advice for anyone thinking of doing the same.", "authors": ["Ashley Abramson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d963dcf8bd8ec26c749e6d6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
