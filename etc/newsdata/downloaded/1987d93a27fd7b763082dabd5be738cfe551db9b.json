India, the music of Bollywood. Could the chaotic, fast-growing region of Southeast Asia be a new hotbed for hip hop?\n\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Universal Music Group (UMG) is seen at a building in Zurich, Switzerland July 25, 2016. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n\nVivendi\u2019s Universal Music Group (UMG) is hoping so.\n\nThe unveiling of its Southeast Asia headquarters in Singapore on Tuesday came with a performance from six newly-signed rappers - whose bleached hair, gold jewellery and baggy clothing jarred somewhat with the business hotel backdrop.\n\n\u201cWe are making a bet on hip hop but I think it\u2019s a pretty safe one,\u201d said Adam Granite, who oversees UMG\u2019s market development in Asia.\n\n\u201cHip hop is often about struggle and the streets and southeast Asia has some challenging components. You have poverty in places ... some difficult living situations, and where you see hip hop really resonate is when it can be as authentic as possible.\u201d\n\nOf the artists signed to UMG\u2019s flagship hip hop label Def Jam, Thai rapper Daboyway is the most well-known locally with one million followers on Instagram.\n\nHe said appetite for the genre in the region has been \u201ccrazy\u201d in recent years as listeners expand from long-established U.S. acts to focus on home-grown talent.\n\nAs such, many of region\u2019s artists sing in their mother tongue to solidify their domestic support.\n\nBut UMG\u2019s Granite says this is no longer as much of a barrier for international audiences, as exemplified by Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi\u2019s 2017 hit \u2018Despacito\u2019 and \u2018Gangnam Style\u2019 by Korea\u2019s Psy in 2012.\n\nThe challenges for rap music in the region may be closer to home. A genre which often tackles contentious social issues can be challenging in countries where free speech is curbed including Singapore and elsewhere in the region.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all had situations where radio stations say: we don\u2019t think we can play this song,\u201d said Malaysian rapper Joe Flizzow.\n\n\u201cWe try to be sensitive but at the same time being hip hop artists you\u2019ve got to keep it 100 (percent real) because people see right through it if you are being fake.\u201d\n\nUMG\u2019s new Singapore hub is designed to anchor its business in the region, which now includes a Vietnam office. Finding the next K-Pop would be icing on the cake.\n\n\u201cIt (K-Pop) really is world class: the quality of the artistry, of the songs, of the dancing, of the outfits,\u201d said Granite.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is to elevate the game in many of these other markets to get them on the scale that they can compete.\u201d", "description": "Korea brought the world K-Pop.
