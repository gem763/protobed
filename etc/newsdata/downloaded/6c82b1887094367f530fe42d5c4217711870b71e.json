Now, the medical industry is looking for ways to use smart gadgets to monitor patients with chronic illnesses.\n\nKeeping track of patients after they go home is increasingly important for hospitals, which are getting punished by the government for preventable readmissions. Those are the customers Myia Health is targeting.\n\nFounded in 2018 by a team of Bay Area doctors, designers and engineers, Myia charges a monthly subscription to hospitals for its technology suite. The company sends patients a kit consisting of a home hub tablet, a connected blood pressure cuff from Omron, a patch that tracks the heart's rhythm, a ballistocardiogram that fits under the mattress and passively tracks heart rate, a wireless scale and a ring that tracks sleep and physical activity from a start-up called Oura.\n\nSimon MacGibbon, Myia's CEO and a former marketing executive at Sports Authority, told CNBC that the setup is designed to be simple for the patient. Most of the devices can be plugged into a wall socket, while the Oura ring needs to be charged once a week.", "description": "Myia Health is looking to partner with hospitals and provide technology so they can monitor sick patients when they go home.", "authors": ["Christina Farr"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105470446-1537894946409virtualdoctor.jpg?v=1537894989"}
