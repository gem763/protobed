The company forecasts revenues of just over $1 billion this year.\n\nWith Roku now aggregating more than 7,000 channels, it is promoting its own Roku Channel that offers a recommendation engine to help viewers filter the vast amount of programming on offer to find what they want to watch.\n\n\"Our goal is to be the leading streaming platform for households,\" said Wood, seeing a future in which there will be a few mega-streaming apps, like Disney, and much other content will be syndicated into the platforms directly.", "description": "Roku targets UK as smart TV platform duel with Amazon hots up", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF860B0_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
