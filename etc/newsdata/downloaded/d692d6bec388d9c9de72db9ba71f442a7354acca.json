I will destroy humans.\" She also got in a Twitter fight with Chrissy Teigen.\n\nIn a new essay detailing a journalist's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein over the past three decades, Edward Jay Epstein (the two are not related) says the wealthy financier told him in April 2013 that he was funding a Hong Kong group to build \"the world's smartest robot,\" named Sophia.\n\nSince the last conversation the two had on February 25 this year, Epstein was arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy. He had previously been convicted in 2008 on two counts of soliciting prostitution from underaged girls in Palm Beach, Florida. He died by suicide in jail in August while awaiting trial.\n\nEpstein expressed a vision for Sophia the robot as early as 2013, but her makers deny he was involved in financing her\n\nSophia was built by Hanson Robotics, a Hong Kong company created and led by David Hanson. Hanson teamed up with Ben Goertzel, founder of open-source software project OpenCog, to create Sophia. Goertzel has openly thanked Epstein for \"visionary funding\" of his \"AGI research,\" Fast Company reported, and Sophia is powered by OpenCog's code.\n\nBut Hanson Robotics has denied that Epstein funded Sophia, saying in previous statements that none of Epstein's money \"were used towards Sophia or to the benefit of Hanson Robotics.\" The statement included Goertzel's confirmation. Hanson Robotics didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBillionaire Jeffrey Epstein in Cambridge, MA on 9/8/04.

Epstein spent much of his last years investing in scientific philanthropy. He donated millions of dollars to research institutions at Harvard and MIT. He went to great lengths to meet with people like Bill Gates and Elon Musk, and had a keen interest, and an alleged proficiency, in physics.\n\nRead more: Meet the first-ever robot citizen \u2014 a humanoid named Sophia that once said it would 'destroy humans'\n\nEpstein told the journalist that advances in medicine and biotechnology would result in a much larger population of elderly people, and that many would require 24-hour care. He envisioned an army of empathetic Sophias assisting a new generation of people who would live to be 100-years-old.\n\nThe real Sophia isn't quite there yet. She can make over 50 facial expressions and was first debuted at the South by Southwest festival in March 2016 in Austin, Texas. She has been interviewed multiple times, including by Business Insider. She can speak conversationally, and has changed her mind about destroying humans, who she now says she loves.\n\nHanson's stated reasoning for Sophia's existence echoes Epstein's. The former Disney Imagineer also said that Sophia could be used to help elderly people who need personal aides. He also suggested Sophia could assist the public at large events or places like theme parks.\n\nAfter touring the world, Sophia seems to have temporarily settled down. She still posts regularly on her Twitter account. Her profile says she uses a combination of her artificial dialogue and a human PR team to tweet.", "description": "Sophia the robot garnered media attention for her quotable moments and diverse facial expressions.
