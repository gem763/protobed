Part of the plan is a 16 spray nozzles that emit a soapy fluid across the lens housing to wash away anything that makes it through the air shield\n\nWHAT IS LIDAR? Similar to RADAR Uses lasers instead of radio waves Reads light reflected by environment Most expensive system costs $75,000\n\nThe tiara's first line of defence is a small nozzle that shoots a constant stream of pressurized air across the sensor lens, ensuring that bugs and other road debris are pushed away before they get close.\n\nThere's also a system of 16 spray nozzles that emit a soapy fluid across the lens housing to wash away anything that makes it through the air shield.\n\n'Our target is to have [the bug debris] cleaned in under one second,' Mark Bosca, Ford's chief engineer, tells Consumer Reports.\n\nLidar systems have been the source of some criticism in the self-driving car industry.\n\n'Anyone relying on lidar is doomed,' Elon Musk said earlier this year, citing the technolgy's high cost as a reason it wouldn't be widely adopted.\n\nThe biggest name in the industry, Velodyne, sells there lidar sensors for $75,000, but a rival company, Luminar, has begun work on a competing version of the sensor that can be sold for $500.\n\nMost of the semi-autonomous test programs currently on the road, including Tesla's Autopilot and Cadillac's Super Cruise, rely on radar sensors.", "description": "Bold new plan from Ford takes the transition from semi-autonomous to fully self-driving cars one step closer to reality.
