But the school said the color violated its strict dress code policy.\n\nMarian's father, Doug Scott, said the decision was unwarranted.\n\n'They didn't even call us,' her father Doug Scott told WILX.\n\n'Marian didn't leave the house, go on the street and get this done on her own, no - she's 8 years old, we did this ourselves in our own home and there's no way I felt like this would happen.'\n\nHowever, Paragon Charter Academy principal Ben Kriesch defended the decision and said the girl's red extensions were a violation of school policy.\n\nAccording to the academy's handbook, a student's hair color must be natural tones to get their picture taken.\n\nMarian Scott, 8, will have to wait until November to take her school photo after violating school policy\n\nThe eight year old's father said the decision was unwarranted. Doug Scott said: 'We did this ourselves in our own home and there's no way I felt like this would happen'\n\nParagon Charter Academy in Michigan, where Marian Scott, 8, was banned from joining her classmates on school photo day\n\n'If they would have reached out to us and say come get her... she's got a hair issue, we need you to change it, that's not allowed - I would have been fine with why this happened,' Scott told WILX.\n\n'They let her stay in school... so if she's not a disruption to the class, then why is she a disruption to the picture?'\n\nKriesch explained the girl was permitted to stay in class because students with a hair color or style violation have one week to get it corrected, WILX said.\n\nAccording to the school, it did leave a recorded message for parents explaining to the school photo dress code policy before photo day. However, Scott claimed he never received one.\n\nThe family is not removing her from the school, although said improving communication from Paragon administrators is necessary going forward.\n\nMarian returned to school on Monday - minus the red braid.\n\nHer family plans on to have her picture taken on the re-take day in November.", "description": "A third grader was barred from school photo because her red hair extensions were not 'natural tones.'
