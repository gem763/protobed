I was a bit tired this morning and I suddenly looked in the mirror as I was doing my tie and I went I haven't shaved.\n\nLate! Piers Morgan was left flustered as the opening credits of Good Morning Britain rolled on Wednesday\n\n'Every morning I get up and have a shower and a shave. How could I forget to shave?\n\n'And then I thought, \"can I get away with it?\", but no there was a slight stubble. There'd be someone out there like, \"oh, look at him the slovenly old vagrant\".\n\n'We had an emergency, but someone had an electric razor, which I haven't used for about 30 years.'\n\nCo-anchor Susanna Reid laughed off Piers tardiness, joking that he had been axed from the show, following a petition that has been running online to have him fired.\n\nSpat! Piers had been up the night before arguing with David Walliams and Matt Lucas on Twitter [pictured in happier times, in 2007]\n\n'For a moment there, I thought the petition had succeeded!' the brunette quipped.\n\nPiers' Twitter spat unfolded hours before, between him and the Little Britian comedy duo of Lucas and Walliams, who famously fell out themselves during a lengthy tiff.\n\nThe Twitter row began when Piers noticed that David had liked a tweet about him which read: 'Just a reminder that @piersmorgan released fake photos of torture in Iraq that endangered the lives of British soldiers, refused to apologise and rightfully got sacked.'\n\nPiers tweeted: 'Amusing that \u2066@davidwalliams regularly \"likes\" the nastiest tweets about me, yet is such a sniveling toady to my face.'\n\nHe then added, in a final dig: 'It\u2019s not my fault \u2066@BGT \u2069 ratings were so much higher when I was in your chair Dave!'\n\nTardy: A last-minute glance in the mirror before the show went live the following morning caused Piers to run onto the set late\n\nPiers explained as he took his seat while the opening credits came to an end: 'I was literally in my dressing room 10 minutes ago. I was a bit tired this morning and I suddenly looked in the mirror as I was doing my tie and I went I haven't shaved'\n\nPiers was a judge on Britian's Got Talent during its first-fourth seasons, alongside Amanda Holden and Simon Cowell, before being replaced with Michael McIntyre, David Hasselhoff and then David.\n\nDavid's former-comedy partner Matt also chimed into the tiff - which David failed to react to - by tweeting: 'Purely objectively - 1) He was probably being polite. Some people are. 2) Boasting about the BGT ratings and popularity when you were briefly on it to someone who has not only transformed the show but is consistently the biggest-selling author in the country didn't work.'\n\nPiers hit back: 'Hi Matt, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \"polite\" to be friendly to people in person but poisonous behind their back - it\u2019s cowardly. As for BGT, I was very proudly on it for the first 4 years when ratings topped 20 million. They\u2019re now half that. Not a boast, just a fact.'\n\nMatt simply replied: 'Go to bed!'\n\nCatty: Piers' Twitter spat unfolded hours before, when he noticed that David had liked an unsavory tweet about him\n\nTo which Piers had the last word, tweeting: 'Fight your own battles. You certainly fought one with him long enough.'\n\nThis isn't the first time Piers has hit out at David's position on the long-running ITV series.\n\nIn 2018, the news anchor told OK! Magazine: 'I'd be the new head judge if the money was right. If Simon made me an offer I couldn't refuse I would, and frankly looking at the performance of David Walliams, that question should come sooner rather than later!'\n\nTit for tat: David's pal Matt jumped to his defense\n\nHe used that opportunity as a chance to declare the viewing figures, too.\n\n'When I was a judge the ratings were 20 million, and they're half that now. I'm doing the maths and it doesn't look good for Simon!' he said.\n\nHowever, the show aired twice this year, with the regular season followed by a BGT: The Champions series this summer.\n\nThe show's fourth judge, Alesha Dixon, is currently judging America's Got Talent: The Champions, in a move that saw her replace Mel B behind the judging desk.", "description": "Piers Morgan was left flustered as the opening credits of Good Morning Britain rolled on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Andrew Bullock For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/12/19784822-0-image-a-29_1571225176732.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
