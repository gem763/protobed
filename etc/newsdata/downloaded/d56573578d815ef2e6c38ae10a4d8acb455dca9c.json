But the answer was clearly not good.\n\nThe two men were once close. Mr. Lombardo worked for Mr. Weinstein as the head of Miramax Italy. He helped save Mr. Weinstein\u2019s life after the movie mogul fell dangerously ill on the island of St. Barts and Mr. Weinstein served as the best man at Mr. Lombardo\u2019s wedding in 2003.\n\nNow, the fallout from Mr. Weinstein\u2019s catastrophic decline has engulfed him, too. Mr. Lombardo has become the object of scornful media coverage amid allegations by a well-known Italian actress and by a former model that he knowingly led them into private meetings in which Mr. Weinstein sexually harassed them nearly 20 years ago.", "description": "Fabrizio Lombardo insisted he was a key employee of the movie producer in Italy. Former colleagues and women who\u2019ve accused the mogul of harassment say otherwise.", "authors": ["Jason Horowitz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/25/world/europe/25lombardo/23lombardo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2017-10-24"}
