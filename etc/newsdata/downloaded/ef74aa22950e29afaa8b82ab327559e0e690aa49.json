(AP) - New York Jets defensive coordinator Gregg Williams says he and his coaching staff don\u2019t instruct players to use dirty tactics against opponents, as Cleveland Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. accuses.\n\nWilliams said Friday he has never told any players to take cheap shots, and his defenses play within the NFL\u2019s rules.\n\nBeckham accused Williams on Thursday of getting him injured in a preseason game two years ago while the receiver was with the Giants and Williams was a coach on the Browns\u2019 staff. Beckham said he was told by current Browns teammates they were instructed to take him out of the game.\n\nWilliams first jokingly asked who Beckham is, then said the media is cooperating by giving the receiver\u2019s comments attention.\n\nWilliams also bristled when asked about his Bountygate past, insisting someone else ask another question.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "New York Jets defensive coordinator Gregg Williams says he and his coaching staff don't instruct players to use dirty tactics against opponents, as Cleveland Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. accuses.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/browns_beckham_cheap_shots_football_94348_c0-177-4219-2636_s1770x1032.jpg?cbda33d6dfc577bc7b77f9d0855f5bc2f4ec9922", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
