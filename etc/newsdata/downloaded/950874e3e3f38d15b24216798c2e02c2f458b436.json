Haier later issued a notice on its platform saying the four employees did not take a nap during break time, but slept in public reception areas during working hours. This, the company claimed, violated Haier's employee code of conduct and their contracts should be terminated. Should employees be fired for taking a nap at work? Readers share their opinions.\n\nthunderbird (Canada)\n\nNo one should be napping on company time. If discovered, such behavior is subject to disciplinary action. In some severe cases, repeated misconduct may lead to termination of employment (in some Canadian government establishments).
