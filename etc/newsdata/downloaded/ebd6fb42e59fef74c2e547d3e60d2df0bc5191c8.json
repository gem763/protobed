Will rushed over and gave her a hug for comfort.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nShirley looked touched too, but managed: \"This is you, you came out here and shared your journey. I'm sure that every child in every children's hospital is looking at that today and has discovered that no matter what you put your mind to you can do it under extreme circumstances.\n\n\"You're inspiring. You give the whole nation hope.\"\n\nThe rest of the night saw some absolute showstoppers from the likes of Saffron and AJ, Karim and Amy and, unsurprisingly, Kelvin and Oti.\n\nSaffron and AJ triumphed this week, sitting at the top of the leader board with an unbelievable 38 points.\n\nThey wowed the judge with their Foxtrot set to Frank Sinatra, and earned Alfonso's only 10 out of 10 for the whole night.", "description": "Motsi and guest judge Alfonso were reduced to tears after Will and partner Janette Manrara visited Great Ormond Street Hospital before hitting the floor", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20657605.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Strictly-Motsi-cries-at-Wills-routine.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
