Not just because Liverpool won the Champions League but because he has been an amazing player for Liverpool.\n\n\"He gives so much to that side. And him and Mane together (on Liverpool's left)- I wouldn't want to be on the right side for the other team.\"\n\nEnrique experienced his fair share of United v Liverpool matches, and believes it is still a huge game in spite of the ever-growing gap in quality between the two sides.\n\n\"For the players, for the fans, it is still the biggest game,\" he added. \"Even Liverpool's rivalry with City, even with the way they are doing [pales in comparison]. The rivalry between United and Liverpool is different.\n\n(Image: PETER POWELL/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\"The preparation is the same. The only thing when you play this game is in your mind you are more nervous than other games - that is obvious.\n\n\"It's another game, it's [potentially] three points more, but for the fans and the players it means more. So if you win it, you have a good night after the game!\"", "description": "Since his move to Anfield from Hull in 2017 the Scottish international has become a key part of Jurgen Klopp's side", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Getty", "Peter Powell Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20391811.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-FC-vs-FC-Salzburg-United-Kingdom-02-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
