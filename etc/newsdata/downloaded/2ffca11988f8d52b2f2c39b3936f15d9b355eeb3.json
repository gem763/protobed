So I had to hide my cheese hat in Portia\u2019s purse.\n\n\u2018During the game they showed a shot of George and me laughing together and people were upset. They thought, \u201cWhy is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president?\u201d\u2019\n\nShe continued, addressing the backlash: \u2018Here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m friends with George Bush. I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have. We\u2019re all different and I think we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s okay that we\u2019re all different\u2026\n\n\u2018Just because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not going to be friends with them. When I say, \u201cBe kind to one another,\u201d I don\u2019t only mean only the people who think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone.\n\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019\n\nEllen joked: \u2018Even people who are already playing Christmas music, seriously, there is no excuse for that. But I\u2019m kind to them.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a sign that all is not horrible, the comedian shared a tweet that had been sent amid the maelstrom that read: \u2018Ellen and George Bush together makes me have faith in America again.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s all live life like that tweeter, eh?\n\nGot a showbiz story?
