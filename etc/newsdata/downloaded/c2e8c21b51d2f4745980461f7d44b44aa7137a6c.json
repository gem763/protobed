I don't think it's inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles.'\n\nChina's state broadcaster, CCTV, said it strongly opposed Silver's support of Morey and that it was reviewing its relationship with the NBA.\n\nCCTV argued that any comments that challenged a country's sovereignty and social stability were 'not within the scope of freedom of speech'.\n\nThe NBA has worked for years to cultivate the Chinese market and regularly plays exhibition games there. Its top stars, including Rockets guard James Harden, frequently visit to meet fans and take part in promotions with sponsors.\n\nThe Rockets are widely followed in China, partly because they drafted Yao Ming in 2002, who became a star for Houston and helped build the NBA's following in China.\n\nYao, who is now the Chinese basketball chief, is 'extremely hot' over the controversy sparked by Morey's pro-democracy tweet.\n\nHouston Rockets' general manager, Daryl Morey, apologized on Monday for the tweet he swiftly deleted over the weekend that included an image of the activists' rally cry: 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong'\n\nFormer Rockets player Yao Ming, who is now the Chinese basketball chief, is 'extremely hot' over the controversy sparked by Morey's pro-democracy tweet\n\nTIMELINE OF ROCKETS RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA 2002: The Houston Rockets drafts Chinese basketball player Yao Ming, who goes on to become a star for them and helps build the NBA's following in China 2009: Yao purchases the Shanghai Sharks, his former CBA team July 20, 2011: Hall of Fame center Yao announces his retirement and leaves the Rockets after helping them to build a huge following in China 2016: Shanghai-born Yao is elected to the Hall of Fame February 23, 2017: The Chinese Basketball Association votes unanimously to appoint former Houston Rockets star Ming as its president October 4, 2019: Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweets an image of the Hong Kong activists' rally cry: 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.' It prompts outrage from Chinese fans with Chinese business partners halting work with the NBA team as a result. October 5, 2019: The Rockets try to distance themselves from the controversy, with owner Tilman Fertitta writing on Twitter that Morey 'does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets... we are NOT a political organization'. October 6, 2019: Morey apologizes, saying he didn't intend to offend fans in China. The NBA issues its own statement, saying it recognizes Morey's views 'have offended so many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.' U.S. lawmakers argue that the NBA's response is shameful and shows how China is using its economic power to censor speech by Americans.\n\nSilver said he hoped to work with Yao to cool the escalating dispute after saying variously that he was 'extremely upset', 'extremely unsettled' and 'extremely hot'.\n\n'I am hoping that together, Yao Ming and I can find an accommodation,' said Silver, who visits Yao's hometown of Shanghai on Wednesday for two pre-season exhibition games.\n\n'But he is extremely hot at the moment and I understand it.'\n\nAlthough the two league bosses would be expected to meet as the NBA stages its annual China pre-season exhibition games, Silver did not explicitly confirm that a meeting would take place.\n\nSilver said the NBA had 'communicated directly' with Yao over the controversy.\n\n'I am not sure he quite accepts how we are operating our business right now, and I accept that we have a difference of opinion,' Silver said.\n\n'I don't come here to tell others how to run their governments... But at the end of the day I am an American and there are these values that are deeply rooted in the DNA of the NBA, and that includes freedom of expression for our employees.'\n\nIt comes as Chinese business have said they will no longer cooperate with the Rockets in the wake of the controversy.\n\nIn addition to CCTV refusing to broadcast NBA pre-season exhibition games this week, the broadcaster vowed to not show any future Rockets games.\n\nTencent Sports, which is the NBA's digital partner in China, also said it would suspend live streaming for future Rockets games. They also said they would not cover or post news about the team.\n\nSportswear brand Li-Ning and sponsor Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPD Bank) Credit Card Center said on Sunday they were suspending cooperation with the Rockets.\n\n'We want to express our indignation and strong condemnation,' read a statement from Li-Ning, published on the Twitter-like Weibo platform.\n\n'We have already stopped our cooperation with the Houston Rockets and continue to urge them to give a clear answer on this matter.'\n\nChina's SPD Bank also said on Sunday that it has suspended related marketing activities and publicity.\n\n'SPD Bank Credit Card Center expresses strong protest and opposition to the wrong remarks made by Houston Rockets' General Manager Daryl Morey,' the bank said in a statement on its Weibo account.\n\nNeither statements said whether the decisions were permanent.\n\nChinese smartphone maker Vivo, a key sponsor for the exhibition games in China, announced on Tuesday it was suspending all ties with the NBA, underscoring the strength of the backlash in the country.\n\nChinese sportswear maker ANTA Sports Products Ltd, which has endorsement contracts with several NBA players including Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson and Boston Celtics forward Gordon Hayward, also said on Tuesday it was halting contract renewal negotiations with the league.\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz criticized the response of the NBA on Twitter on Sunday\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke also tweeted in response to the statement\n\nFlorida Senator Rick Scott also weighed in accusing the NBA of being more interested in money than human rights\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Julian said China was using its economic power to silence critics\n\nNew Jersey Congressman Tom Malinowski tweeted the China was using its economic power to censor speech by Americans in the U.S.\n\nThe furore started when Morey posted a tweet on Friday featuring the message 'Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong' in reference to the four-month old protest movement that has upturned the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\n\nThe post was later deleted and 47-year-old Morey, the NBA's executive of the year in 2018, said his views did not represent the team or league.\n\n'I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,' Morey tweeted.\n\n'I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.'\n\n'I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention.'\n\nThe post drew rebuke from the Chinese Basketball Association, which is headed by former Rockets star center Yao Ming, who said it would suspend cooperation with the Rockets.\n\nThe Chinese league said on Sunday via its official social media that it 'strongly disagrees' with Morey's 'improper remarks' regarding Hong Kong.\n\nIn a separate statement, the NBA said: 'We recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.'\n\n'We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.'\n\nThat response sparked fierce criticism from U.S. lawmakers, with Texas Senator Ted Cruz writing: 'As a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party's repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong. Now, in pursuit of $, the @NBA is shamefully retreating.'\n\nHe added: 'We're better than this; human rights shouldn't be for sale & the NBA shouldn't be assisting Chinese communist censorship.'\n\nSenator Josh Hawley sent a letter to the NBA to express his 'disgust' over the league's decision to apologize for Morey's views.\n\n'Doing business in China is one thing, but for the NBA to kowtow to the demands of one of the world's most brutal regimes in the pursuit of profit is, frankly, revolting. You know better. And the people of this country deserve better,\" he wrote.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke said: 'The only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights. What an embarrassment.'\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Julian Castro added: 'The United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government.'", "description": "The NBA's lucrative Chinese following is facing an unprecedented threat after Rockets GM Daryl Morey last week tweeted support for pro-democracy protests in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/14/19444112-0-image-a-9_1570541992521.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
