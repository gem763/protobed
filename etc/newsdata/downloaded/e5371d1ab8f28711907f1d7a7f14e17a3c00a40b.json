The young ball of energy would look out at them and feel a pang of jealousy. She thought of all the hard work she put in to build herself up for September after the World Cup - wasted. All for an injury she picked up in only the second game of the season.\n\nAt just 20 years old, this five weeks out of touch with the group has felt long for the England forward. \u201cIt is difficult,\u201d says Stanway. \u201cEspecially when you\u2019re in the gym and the girls are on the pitch and you can hear them getting excited for game day, getting all pumped. I think that\u2019s one of the hardest things to kind of sink in.\n\n\u201cEverything you\u2019ve worked for and the efforts that you\u2019ve put in are kind of taken away from you. You kind of feel like, you\u2019re kind of out of it. It\u2019s kind of you\u2019re getting removed from an environment that you love the most and I think that\u2019s the hardest thing for me.\u201d", "description": "Every so often, when Georgia Stanway was working hard in the gym to recover from her hamstring injury, from inside she would hear the sounds of her Manchester City teammates on the pitch.", "authors": ["Sophie Penney", "Sam Dean", "Jamie Carragher", "Fiona Tomas"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000202126735-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqy81pHNlW26k7kWS-Prb1CsNXlHzFQX0q9rbqpSNZfi0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
