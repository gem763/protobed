The option\u2014a simple bill calling for a popular vote on Dec. 12\u2014is designed to appeal to opposition parties and will likely be voted on as soon as Tuesday.\n\nFor the approach he took on Monday, Mr. Johnson needed a two-thirds majority in Parliament to call an election. But with lawmakers from the main opposition Labour Party abstaining from the vote, his motion drew only 299 votes in favor and 70 against, falling far short of the 434 votes it needed.\n\nThe result marked the prime minister\u2019s third failed bid for an election, which he hopes will give him a parliamentary majority to deliver the country\u2019s divorce from the EU.\n\nMr. Johnson\u2019s new tack is to try to bring opposition parties on board with a new law calling for an election. That would require only a simple majority of voting lawmakers to agree. He has hesitated to take that step until this week because such legislation can be amended.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How likely is a British general election this year, will it just be about Brexit and what will be its outcome? Join the conversation below.\n\nNow, however, the prime minister hopes to take advantage of a shift by two smaller anti-Brexit parties, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party. They have indicated they would team up with Mr. Johnson to propose a law to hold an election on Dec. 9.\n\nThe three-day gap between those provisional dates could still prove problematic. Liberal Democrats want a vote on Dec. 9 to ensure that students can vote before they head home on Christmas vacation. Government officials, meanwhile, question whether a new law can be pushed through quickly enough to hold the vote on that date, even as they call for vote on Dec. 12. A five-week period must elapse between Parliament\u2019s last sitting and a general election. Other opposition parties could still try to amend the proposed law to skew the vote more in favor of anti-Brexit voters.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson speaking in the House of Commons on Monday after losing a parliamentary vote for an early general election.

It would also fall at a time when most students \u2014who polls show are far more likely than the general voting population to oppose Brexit\u2014are still at university, where they are generally registered to vote.\n\nThe smaller parties hope a new Parliament would be more inclined than the current one to make any Brexit deal subject to a second Brexit referendum.\n\nJo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said she wouldn\u2019t vote for the election if it were to be held on Dec. 12. But the bill is amendable and a new date could be proposed after it is passed.\n\nEarlier Monday, the EU agreed to delay Brexit for a third time until the end of January, acting on a request lawmakers had already forced the prime minister make against his will. That was a blow to Mr. Johnson, who repeatedly pledged to take the U.K. out of the bloc by Thursday come what may. Mr. Johnson accepted the extension in a letter later Monday.\n\nMr. Johnson renegotiated the Brexit deal with the EU this month. While Parliament approved the deal in principle, it didn\u2019t ratify it in time for Mr. Johnson\u2019s planned Oct. 31 exit and demanded more time to scrutinize it. If lawmakers agree Tuesday to a December election, his deal is unlikely to advance in Parliament.\n\nA December election, which would be the country\u2019s first in that month since 1923, could prove a pivotal moment in the Brexit drama. If Mr. Johnson were to win big, he could push his Brexit deal through Parliament and seal the departure that weeks ago appeared unattainable. But if anti-Brexit parties hold the balance of power in another hung Parliament, the departure could be canceled or another referendum held.\n\nA parliamentary vote this week would set the stage for one of the most bitterly fought elections in recent British history.\n\nVoters won\u2019t be choosing just between different views on Brexit but also two radically different economic visions for the country. The Labour Party is preparing to campaign on its most left-wing manifesto in more than a generation, renationalizing industries and raising taxes on businesses. The Conservative Party, meanwhile, is pitching Britain as a free-trading, lightly regulated business hub.\n\nHolding a general election isn\u2019t without risk for Mr. Johnson, even though he strongly leads in the polls. Britain\u2019s winner-takes-all electoral system means the outcome hinges on a few key districts. His predecessor, Theresa May, won 42% of the popular vote in 2017 and lost her majority in Parliament.\n\nMr. Johnson is currently polling at 35% of the vote according to a poll of polls by Britain Elects, but he is a full 10 percentage points ahead of Labour. Adding to the unpredictability, a handful of smaller parties are polling more strongly than before, potentially splintering the vote. If they take votes and seats away from the Conservatives, Mr. Johnson would struggle to win a majority.\n\nRelated Video After the latest string of rowdy parliamentary sessions and heated debates, British lawmakers finally endorsed a Brexit deal. But despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s push, Brexit may still not happen anytime soon.

Mr. Johnson\u2019s new election tactic is likely to pile even more pressure on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said Monday Mr. Johnson couldn\u2019t be trusted with Brexit. One reason he and other opposition figures cited for not backing the vote on Monday was that it didn\u2019t specify a date, which would be left to Mr. Johnson.\n\nIf Mr. Johnson had won the vote on Monday, he could have delayed the election into January and hypothetically taken the U.K. out of the bloc at the end of January without a deal with the EU. \u201cWe agree that an early election is necessary,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said before the vote, \u201cbut we need a good reason since no election has been held in December since 1923.\u201d\n\nAfter the vote, Mr. Corbyn didn\u2019t reject Mr. Johnson\u2019s new election plan, saying his party would \u201cscrutinize the bill\u201d to make sure it wouldn\u2019t result in a no-deal Brexit.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Johnson berated Mr. Corbyn for failing to trust the people of Britain to make their choice over who should run the country, offering instead the \u201ctoxic, tedious torture\u201d of another referendum.\n\n\u201cFor the third time he has turned down our offer to get Brexit done,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cWe will not allow the paralysis to continue.\u201d\n\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com and Stephen Fidler at stephen.fidler@wsj.com", "description": "A British general election remains likely this year as a way to resolve the Brexit stalemate, even though lawmakers blocked a bid by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to schedule an early ballot.", "authors": ["Max Colchester", "Stephen Fidler", "Max.Colchester Wsj.Com", "Stephen.Fidler Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-121517/social", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
