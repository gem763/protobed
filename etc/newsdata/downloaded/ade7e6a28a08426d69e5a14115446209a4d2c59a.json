While US and UK intelligence agencies conspire to engineer a justification for invasion, GCHQ translator Katharine Gun (whose real-life bravery deserves celebration) follows her conscience and alerts the media to their dirty-tricks campaign, throwing her quiet life into turmoil, putting her work, marriage and freedom at risk.\n\nKeira Knightley: \u2018Iraq was the first time I\u2019d been politically engaged\u2019 Read more\n\nIt\u2019s 2003, and Gun (played with no-nonsense conviction by Knightley) receives a US National Security Agency group email effectively asking her to spy on UN security council members to fix a forthcoming resolution vote for war. She\u2019s outraged, both by the proposal per se and because she believes Blair\u2019s claims of Saddam Hussein\u2019s al-Qaeda links and WMDs aren\u2019t backed up by the evidence. Despite ominous warnings about being \u201cin breach of the Official Secrets Act \u2013 some might call that treason\u201d, Gun leaks the email, which finds its way to the offices of the Observer. Here, journos and editors have stand-up showdowns about supporting or opposing the war, while a cast of extras add Greek choric background accompaniment. Declarative statements abound (\u201cIf you get it wrong, it\u2019ll sink you; it\u2019ll sink the paper!\u201d) but eventually this \u201cfucking good story\u201d hits the front page, and Gun\u2019s life implodes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Katharine Gun\u2019s story hits the front page of the Observer, 2 March 2003.

It\u2019s a gloomy environment: cinematographer Florian Hoffmeister shrouds the action in a cloak of darkness. Whether we\u2019re in the sinister warrens of GCHQ or the supposedly more comfortable confines of a cafe or a bedroom, Hoffmeister and Hood trap their characters in dim pools of light, shadows crowding the edges of the frame.\n\nBy contrast, there\u2019s a pantomine element to some of the performances, most notably Rhys Ifans\u2019s comically chaotic rendering of investigative journalist Ed Vulliamy, mutteringly referred to as a \u201cnutter\u201d, and played accordingly. As Observer editor (and Blairite flag-waver) Roger Alton, the baldified Conleth Hill comes on like a cross between Ed Asner\u2019s Lou Grant and the Fat Controller from Thomas the Tank Engine, all huff and bluster as he mishears \u201cSunni and Shia\u201d as \u201cSonny and Cher\u201d, storming around in a sweary, sweaty stew. Meanwhile Matt Smith is heroically handsome and endearingly deflating as reporter Martin Bright, wryly noting that an underground carpark rendezvous with Yvonne (\u201cFucking\u201d) Ridley is \u201ca little bit Deep Throat, don\u2019t you think?\u201d \u2013 an invocation of All the President\u2019s Men that does this film few favours.\n\nAmid the clutter of broad-strokes thumbnails and celebrity cameos (Tamsin Greig as former Foreign Office deputy legal adviser Elizabeth Wilmshurst; Kenneth Cranham as a scowly Judge Hyam), Knightley\u2019s nuanced portrayal of the uncertain, self-doubting Gun comes as something of a relief. She\u2019s particularly good at conveying Gun\u2019s horror when realising that her actions may have endangered her husband Yasar (Adam Bakri), a Kurdish Turk whose legal status proves vulnerable. A distanced close-up on Knightley\u2019s face as Ralph Fiennes\u2019s lawyer Ben Emmerson lays bare the Kafka-esque ramifications of her plight is masterfully understated.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rhys Ifans as the Observer\u2019s Ed Vulliamy, with Matthew Goode as Peter Beaumont in Official Secrets. Photograph: Ifc Films/Allstar\n\nAdapted by Hood\u2019s co-writers Gregory and Sara Bernstein from Marcia and Thomas Mitchell\u2019s book The Spy Who Tried to Stop a War, Official Secrets inevitably takes some dramatic liberties with its truths. In a recent Guardian feature, for example, former foreign desk assistant Nicole Mowbray recalled how this paper\u2019s readers\u2019 editor had phoned her to explain politely \u201cwith deft understatement and a total lack of drama\u201d that a typing snafu she\u2019d made had caused \u201csomething of an international incident\u201d. On screen, Mowbray is bawled out by Alton in front of the whole office; a minor invention, perhaps, but one that reminds us that most dramatised depictions of \u201ctrue events\u201d can be found guilty of \u201csexing up\u201d their sources \u2013 even those inspired by stories in which the devil really is in the detail.\n\nOf course, amid the cacophony of barefaced lying that Trump and Johnson have made the norm in this \u201cpost-truth\u201d era, Blair\u2019s bland massaging of facts (smugly reassuring David Frost that \u201cwar is not inevitable\u201d) can seem almost quaint, however catastrophic the consequences. Whatever its flaws, Official Secrets reminds us just how seriously the state took its pursuit of Gun, who had nothing to gain and everything to lose by raising the alarm, revealing the teeth behind the smarmy smiles.", "description": "Knightley stars as the GCHQ translator who leaked a classified memo to the Observer exposing the US plot to spy on the UN in 2003", "authors": ["Mark Kermode"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b02009597d78d6960a6f0ec4d963e982c2bf91b6/0_384_5761_3457/master/5761.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=55e18c339574ea0d4a6a7e08c208ab2b", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
