His strategy appears to involve fast-tracking the Brexit deal he reached with Brussels, then going to the voters.\n\nOpposition parties have blocked this stratagem largely because it would give Johnson control of the timing - and still leave open the possibility of Brexit hardliners engineering the \"no-deal\" withdrawal that they prefer.\n\nThe main opposition Labour Party - which says it wants an election, but not yet - has insisted it will not back a poll until it has gained assurances that Johnson will not allow the UK to crash out of the EU without a deal on the new deadline of January 31.\n\n191028184532150\n\nSmall parties to the rescue\n\nIn a surprise move at the weekend, however, the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party seized the agenda by jointly proposing a parliamentary device to deliver Johnson his election.\n\nThey proposed an election on December 9 in a political gamble based on the belief that they could win voters disillusioned with the main parties in a forthcoming poll.\n\nUnlike parliamentary rules that have so far prevented Johnson from engineering an election - by which he needs the backing of two-thirds or 434 of all MPs - the proposed move is likely to take the form of a simple bill that requires a majority of just one.\n\nWhile rejecting the plan in the wake of Monday night's defeat, Johnson proposed an identical device that differs only in terms of the proposed election date - December 12 - but reportedly would include a pledge to put his Brexit withdrawal bill on hold.\n\nParliament is set to decide on Tuesday, with the arithmetic suggesting that both Johnson's proposal or that of the Lib Dems and SNP could result in a December election.\n\n\"Under this Liberal Democrat and SNP one-line bill, there will be a need for just a simple majority - and if the prime minister inevitably has the Lib Dems and the SNP on side, then he should win,\" said Maddy Thimont Jack, a researcher at the Institute for Government in London.\n\nThe dates are important, because agreeing to an election on December 9 would block the prime minister from proceeding with his proposed Brexit withdrawal bill.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats move appeared to recognise that there is insufficient support within Parliament for its favoured policy of a second Brexit referendum - which could in theory entirely reverse the UK's decision to withdraw from the EU.\n\n191025073206900\n\nNikos Skoutaris, associate professor in European Union law at the University of East Anglia, said: \"The Lib Dem and the SNP initiative is puzzling, and probably has to do with the fact that they simply feel confident that in the next elections they are going to get more seats.\n\n\"I don't think they have abandoned the People's Vote - but I think they have become realistic in seeing in the current parliament that the numbers are not there, and so they may as well try in the next parliament.\"\n\nWill Boris win?\n\nIf on Tuesday night a sufficient number of MPs vote for an election, then a vote is certain to take place in December - a month during which UK politicians have typically eschewed elections.\n\nAnalysts said Johnson aims to fight a \"people versus Parliament\" election on the premise that British voters have been let down by their politicians over Brexit.\n\nAlthough his Conservatives are currently well ahead of Labour in the polls - for many observers all bets are off when it comes to predicting the outcome.\n\nRidge-Newman believes firmly, however, that Parliament's refusal to back Johnson's requests for an election will work against it - and in particular, against the leader of the Labour opposition, Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n\"I strongly believe that the way this scenario is panning out is actually strengthening Boris Johnson's position to an incredible extent,\" he said.\n\n\"The Conservatives are playing to the notion that Boris Johnson is pushing forward and breaking every sinew in order to deliver Brexit - yet Parliament, largely led by Jeremy Corbyn, is doing everything it can to stop it.\"\n\nSkoutaris said the entire Brexit debate had been characterised by rapidly changing political fortunes, making the outcome of an election particularly hard to call.\n\nHe added: \"In the current polls he is leading, but 40 days in UK politics is a very long time and anything can happen.\"", "description": "The prime minister has had every bid to go to the polls rebuffed, but there may yet be a chance of a pre-Christmas vote.", "authors": ["Gavin O'Toole"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/a9cff0fd96f44fecab08456a03193e06_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
