Democrats in the House are convinced the answer is yes, but Volodymyr Zelensky says no. In a lengthy press avail earlier in Kyiv, Zelensky told reporters that his July 25 conversation with Trump was \u201cnot corruption, it was just a call.\u201d Zelensky also helpfully added that no extortion took place over either US aid or a White House visit, the BBC reports:\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said there was \u201cno blackmail\u201d in a phone call with Donald Trump that is at the heart of a possible attempt to remove the US president from office. \u201cThis is not corruption, it was just a call,\u201d Mr Zelensky said on Thursday. \u2026 Speaking to reporters at a news conference in Kiev on Thursday, Mr Zelensky said of his 25 July call with Mr Trump: \u201cThere was no blackmail. It was not the subject of our conversation.\u201d He said the purpose of the conversation was to arrange a meeting with Trump, and there were no \u201cconditions\u201d from the US side.\n\nThe Associated Press offered a much more editorialized version of Zelensky\u2019s remarks. After first noting that the Ukrainian president is \u201ctrying to save his reputation\u201d and describing him as \u201cembarrassed \u2026 eager to please Trump,\u201d they get around to reporting that Zelensky considers the US transcript of the call accurate, and that he didn\u2019t feel pressured at all on the call:\n\nHe said he \u201cdidn\u2019t even check\u201d whether the Ukrainian transcript of the July call is the same as that of the White House, but says \u201cI think they match.\u201d \u2026 Zelenskiy said the call \u201cwasn\u2019t linked to weapons or the story with (Ukrainian gas company) Burisma,\u201d where Biden\u2019s son Hunter served on the board.\n\nZelensky didn\u2019t appear to be too uptight in ABC\u2019s portion of the \u201cmedia marathon,\u201d as the Ukrainians called it. Despite considerable pressure from reporter Tom Llamas, Zelensky refused to call Trump\u2019s mention of Biden in the call \u201ccorrupt,\u201d and insisted that his administration wants to deal with all corruption equally:\n\nDonald Trump made sure to mark the occasion:\n\nThe President of the Ukraine just stated again, in the strongest of language, that President Trump applied no pressure and did absolutely nothing wrong. He used the strongest language possible. That should end this Democrat Scam, but it won\u2019t, because the Dems & Media are FIXED! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nWill this end the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment push? Not on your life, as Trump himself acknowledges, but it might dent its credibility a bit. We now have both the transcript and Zelensky\u2019s public corroboration of it on record, plus Zelensky\u2019s testimony to the media about it. No doubt some self-interest is involved in Zelensky\u2019s calculation, but it\u2019s tough to build a case of quid pro quo and corruption when the two players in the alleged act both say nothing of the sort occurred \u2014 and the record backs that up.\n\nMeanwhile, RealClearInvestigations\u2019 Eric Felten picks up on a leak in Ukraine over a very different allegation of pressure and quid pro quo involving a US administration. A Ukrainian newspaper somehow magically got hold of some notes from Rudy Giuliani\u2019s private investigation, and voila!\n\nThe five pages of typewritten, printed-out notes \u2013 not transcripts \u2013together with the IG\u2019s cover letter to lawmakers, were posted this week on a Ukrainian website, The Babel. They appear to memorialize two conversations: one on Jan. 23, when Giuliani spoke by phone with the former general prosecutor of Ukraine, Viktor Shokin; the other is from two days later, when Shokin\u2019s successor, then-General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko, met Giuliani in New York. In addition to the fired Shokin\u2019s claim that President Poroshenko warned him not to investigate Burisma because it was not in the Bidens\u2019 interest, the notes say, the prosecutor also said he \u201cwas warned to stop\u201d by the then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey R. Pyatt. \u2026 Recounting Shokin\u2019s version of events, the notes say he \u201cwas called into Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s office and told that the investigation into Burisma and the Managing Director where Hunter Biden is on the board, has caused Joe Biden to hold up one billion dollars in U.S. aid to Ukraine.\u201d Poroshenko later told Shokin that \u201che had to be fired as the aid to the Ukraine was being withheld by Joe Biden,\u201d the Giuliani interview notes say.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly, um, helpful. Giuliani has confirmed the authenticity of his notes, and why not? It\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility that he leaked them himself, given how helpful it is to his narrative. We do know, though, that the latter part of this does relate to actual events, because Joe Biden himself was helpful enough to brag about holding up a billion dollars in US aid to get Shokin fired.\n\nSince then, Biden has insisted that Shokin wasn\u2019t being aggressive enough about Burisma and other oligarch-controlled entities in Ukraine, and accuses everyone who looks askance at the late-2015 quid pro quo of misreading Shokin\u2019s own corruption. Shokin obviously has his reasons for disputing that, and Giuliani has his reasons to make sure Shokin\u2019s story gets out.\n\nIs it true? It\u2019s tough to say without a truly independent investigation, but Hunter\u2019s connection to Burisma and those probes created a clear conflict of interest for Biden as Vice President. At the very least under these circumstances, Poroshenko could be forgiven a mistaken conclusion that Biden was acting to protect his son, if in fact it was a mistaken conclusion. That conflict of interest is why Biden\u2019s earning the scrutiny that\u2019s coming, about which we\u2019ll have more shortly.", "description": "Plus: Giuliani notes show pressure from ...
