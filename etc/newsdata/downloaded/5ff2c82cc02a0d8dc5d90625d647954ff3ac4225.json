Mally\u201d confiscated from him in Germany. Bieber hit back at PETA after the group criticized his recent purchase of two Savannah cats, an exotic breed that\u2019s produced by breeding a regular cat with an African Serval cat. The breed is legally restricted or banned in 13 states, according to the Savannah Cat Association. The singer paid an Illinois breeder $35,000 for the two kittens, Sushi and Tuna, ahead of his South Carolina wedding to Hailey Baldwin, and like any doting millennial pet owner, has already made an Instagram page for them.\n\nIn a statement to People that unfortunately began with \u201cBaby, baby, baby, nooooooo,\u201d a jokey reference to Bieber\u2019s 2010 hit \u201cBaby,\u201d PETA senior vice-president Lisa Lange said, \u201cJustin Bieber could inspire his fans around the world to save a life by adopting a cat from a local animal shelter \u2014 rather than fueling the dangerous demand for hybrid cats, contributing to the animal overpopulation crisis, and proving that when it comes to helping animals, his stance so far is \u2018I don\u2019t care.\u2019\u201d In his Instagram Stories on Thursday night, Bieber replied with his own statement: \u201cPETA can suck it.\u201d\n\nThough that seemed to sum up his feelings nice and succinctly, Bieber went on, arguing that PETA should \u201cgo focus on real problems,\u201d like \u201cpoaching and animal brutality.\u201d He also criticized the organization for not calling him out every time he paid exorbitant amounts of money for an animal instead of adopting one. \u201cU weren\u2019t tripping when I got my dog Oscar and he wasn\u2019t a rescue \u2026 every pet we get must be a rescue? I believe in adopting rescues but I also think there are preferences and that\u2019s what breeders are for.\u201d Then, in a follow up post: \u201cPETA go help with all of the plastic in the ocean, and leave my beautiful cats alone.\u201d He also tagged their Instagram page, \u201c@kittysushiandtuna.\u201d Neither PETA nor Bieber referenced O.G. Mally, who, according to a 2018 Babe (RIP) report, is still struggling to adapt to life at Germany\u2019s Serengeti Wildlife Park.\n\nAnyway, Sushi and Tuna already have over 243,000 followers on Instagram.", "description": "PETA criticized Justin Bieber for spending $35,000 on two exotic Savannah cat kittens ahead of his wedding to Hailey Bieber.
