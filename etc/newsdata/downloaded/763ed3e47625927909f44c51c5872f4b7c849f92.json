Mr. Nichols said his parents used to skate at the Empire Roller Skating Center in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, when he was young. His sister did, too; she had a pair of skates with wooden wheels.\n\nMr. Nichols liked skating outdoors. He began in the late 1970s, just as roller skating rebounded with a disco beat. Then, roller disco dominated popular culture with the catchy sounds of Gloria Gaynor , KC and the Sunshine Band and, later, the Bee Gees. It was popular, too, at exclusive clubs like the Roxy, in Chelsea, where Mr. Nichols occasionally skated.\n\n\u201cIt was a celebrity thing,\u201d Mr. Nichols said of the club. \u201cI\u2019m a baby boomer person.
