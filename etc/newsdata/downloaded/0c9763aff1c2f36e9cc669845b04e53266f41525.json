Trump said Baghdadi was \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming all the way\u201d before detonating a vest he was wearing.\n\nAD\n\nAsked how he knew what Baghdadi was doing in the moments before his death, Trump demurred. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it, but he was screaming, crying and whimpering,\u201d said the president, who repeatedly called Baghdadi a \u201ccoward.\u201d \u201cAnd he was scared out of his mind.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSecond is the role the Kurds and Russia played.\n\nIn the hours before Trump\u2019s news conference, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said it was a joint operation between them and the United States.\n\nFor five months there has been joint intel cooperation on the ground and accurate monitoring, until we achieved a joint operation to kill Abu Bakir al-Bagdadi.\n\n\n\nThanks to everybody who participate in this great mission.@realDonaldTrump#SDF#USArmy #Rojava #Baghdadi \u2014 Mazloum Abd\u00ee \u0645\u0638\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u064a (@MazloumAbdi) October 27, 2019\n\nTrump portrayed the U.S.-allied Kurds, who have carried the brunt of the recent U.S. withdrawal from northern Syria and whose value as allies Trump has minimized, as playing more of a bit part.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Trump initially thanked others, in fact, he mentioned Russia first, then Syria, Turkey and Iraq. He added that there was also \u201ccertain support [the Kurds] were able to give us.\u201d\n\nLater, Trump would credit Russia first in the news conference, saying it was \u201cgreat\u201d and that Iraq was \u201cexcellent.\u201d\n\nHe also disclosed that Russia was given a heads-up about the operation, even as top Democrats in Congress were not. \u201cWe told them, \u2018We\u2019re coming in.\u2019 \u2026 And they said, \u2018Thank you for telling us,\u2019 \u201d Trump said. He added, \u201cThey did not know the mission.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump said, however, that he didn\u2019t tell House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) because he worried about leaks spoiling the operation. Before the news conference, there were reports that Trump also hadn\u2019t notified House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who is a leader of the impeachment inquiry against Trump but would generally be a member of Congress you\u2019d inform about these things.\n\nAD\n\nTrump seems to be indicating that he trusts Russia with this information more than congressional Democrats, which will be a talking point in the days ahead. He also seems to be placing Russia ahead of the Kurds, even though Russia wasn\u2019t actually involved in the mission, which seems a conspicuous choice.\n\nThe third striking thing is the credit-taking. Trump wasn\u2019t initially very forward about how much credit he thought he deserved for this. As he took questions, it was clear what he was angling for.\n\nAD\n\nMost significantly, he repeatedly alluded to the idea that Baghdadi\u2019s death was a bigger moment than Osama bin Laden\u2019s. Bin Laden was killed in 2011 on President Barack Obama\u2019s watch, and Trump at the time accused Obama of taking credit for it.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest one perhaps that we\u2019ve ever captured,\u201d Trump said Sunday, early in the question-and-answer portion of the news conference.\n\nLater, he added: \u201cThis is the biggest there is. This is the worst ever. Osama bin Laden was big, but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center. This is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country.\"\n\nTrump also returned to his wildly exaggerated claim that he had warned people about a bin Laden attack in a book a year before the Sept. 11, 2001, strikes. One line about that showed just how much credit Trump intends on taking for all this in the days and months ahead.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get any credit for\u201d the bin Laden warnings, he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s okay. I never do. But here we are.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "So much detail, the role of the Kurds and his effort to portray this as bigger than bin Laden.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pCwXcuyKevjG5r77ypu0Du-EIL0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GK2HZRHYYYI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
