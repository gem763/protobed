Brown cherry pick facts from former astronaut Lisa Nowak\u2019s stranger-than-fiction story to reach some larger point about the metaphysical and psychological effects of space travel. But the significant and seemingly random changes, embellishments and omissions make you wonder why they even needed the tether of Nowak in the first place. And no, I\u2019m not talking about diapers or the lack thereof.\n\nNowak was a Naval Academy graduate, a mother of three and an accomplished astronaut who in July 2006 went to the International Space Station as a mission specialist on the shuttle Discovery. Less than a year later, in the midst of an affair with a fellow astronaut, she made national news by driving 900 miles to confront her lover\u2019s other girlfriend. She wore a wig and a trench coat and had in her car a knife, a BB pistol, a steel mallet and surgical tubing. She became the butt of many jokes, lost her job and was discharged from the Navy.\n\nThe headlines often summed up the situation as a torrid love triangle. Some wondered why a woman with a family and so many professional accomplishments would risk everything for an affair. Love makes you crazy, many concluded. But \u201cLucy in the Sky\u201d foists an alternate narrative on the situation: What if it wasn\u2019t really a jealous lover\u2019s rage? What if 12 days, 18 hours and 36 minutes in space changes a person\u2019s composition in ways that for all of our years of space travel we have yet to really reconcile with?\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating question, but one that \u201cLucy in the Sky\u201d only kind of deals with. Natalie Portman assumes the role of the protagonist who the movie calls Lucy Cola for perhaps no other reason other than having the excuse to use The Beatles song. She is a no-nonsense scientist who has spent her life striving to be the best, overcoming such professional handicaps as being a woman and not having an Ivy League education. She has a thick southern accent, an inexplicable Dorothy Hamill haircut, a sweet and doting husband, Drew (Dan Stevens) who can\u2019t open jars without her help, and, in this account, no children. She does, however, have a teenage niece (Pearl Amanda Dickson) who she often has to look after.\n\nWe meet Lucy in space and it\u2019s a powerful moment. Portman\u2019s almond eyes tear up and submit to the overwhelming enormousness of being wholly alone in the darkness. She sees her small life on earth as though in a trance. And suddenly it\u2019s over and she\u2019s back to doing school pickups and opening jars and running laps. It\u2019s a comedown that she\u2019s not prepared for, which is part of the reason why she finds herself in an extramarital dalliance with a fellow astronaut, Mark Goodwin (Jon Hamm), who has also had a life changing experience in space and come back somewhat broken.\n\nThere are moments of intense beauty in \u201cLucy in the Sky,\u201d mostly when Hawley zooms in on his star\u2019s evocative face. But Portman alone can\u2019t save this muddled endeavor. In his feature directorial debut, the creator of the \u201cFargo\u201d and \u201cLegion\u201d television series tries to do too much to make everything more interesting (like changing the aspect ratio of the frame more than a few times and forcing an eye-rolling butterfly metaphor into the story). In the end, too, neither Lucy nor Lisa is redeemed or made more remarkable. The film still settles for a sensationalist climax in an airport parking lot with Portman in a wig and a trench coat confronting Mark and his new girlfriend Erin (Zazie Beetz in a mostly thankless role).\n\nIt\u2019d be too easy to try to blame all the men involved, but in the past few years we\u2019ve had a number of quite interesting, nuanced and entertaining looks at tabloid scandals including \u201cMolly\u2019s Game,\u201d \u201dI, Tonya\u201d and even this year\u2019s \u201cHustlers\u201d - two of which were written and directed by men. The \u201cLucy\u201d team just missed the mark.\n\n\u201cLucy in the Sky,\u201d a Fox Searchlight/Walt Disney Studios release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \u201cfor language and some sexual content.\u201d Running time: 124 minutes. Two stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nMPAA Definition of R: Restricted.
