REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo\n\nShares in Atlanta-based UPS fell 3.7 percent to $114.18 on news of the departure of Chief Operating Officer Barber, who oversees the company\u2019s global small package, freight, supply chain, freight forwarding and engineering, and was instrumental in the company\u2019s turnaround.\n\n\u201cInvestors assumed he was going to be the next CEO and this caught us by surprise. Unfortunately the market does not like surprises,\u201d Seaport Global analyst Kevin Sterling said.\n\nUPS volume for Next Day Air delivery within the United States rose about 24% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, benefiting from strong e-commerce demand and rival FedEx Corp\u2019s (FDX.N) breakup with online retailer Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) this summer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Amazon, but it\u2019s beyond Amazon,\u201d Chief Executive David Abney said in a telephone interview with Reuters.\n\n\u201cCompanies are competing on time. Next Day has become the standard. We see it in our Next Day Ground and our Next Day Air,\u201d said Abney, who noted that the company\u2019s multi-billion-dollar investments in network upgrades have shaved per-package costs down 2.5%.\n\nDespite the advantage, investors remain wary of the potential ill-effects of the ongoing US-China trade war on the company as it gears up for what could be its biggest holiday season in history.\n\nUPS net income rose 16% to $1.75 billion, or $2.01 per share, in the third quarter.\n\nRevenue rose 5% to $18.32 billion.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned $2.07 per share.\n\nAnalysts on average had estimated earnings of $2.06 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.", "description": "United Parcel Service Inc's e-commerce fueled quarterly profit beat on Tuesday was overshadowed by news that Jim Barber, widely viewed as the world's biggest parcel delivery firm's next leader, would retire at year-end.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443729109&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L11P", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
