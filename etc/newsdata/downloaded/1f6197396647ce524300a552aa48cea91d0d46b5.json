The dynasty at the time wielded dominance over the world with twice China\u2019s output of last year.\n\n\n\nOn Oct. 1, China celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the communist state. I arrived at the national ceremony at 4 a.m. at the press booth set up at the east of the Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace that stands as the monumental gate in the center of Beijing \u2014 as required and sat there with other journalists for four hours until the ceremony began.\n\n\n\nBy 10:00 a.m. the 50,000 seats installed in the square were entirely filled. The audience had eyes on the main podium where China\u2019s incumbent and former leaders \u2014 Xi Jinping, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao \u2014 were all seated. The parade of China\u2019s newest weapons, including next-generation intercontinental ballistic missiles that can carry multiple nuclear warheads, displayed the country\u2019s mighty arms capabilities. The ceremony aimed at fully showing off the country\u2019s achievements over the span of 70 years lasted two hours and 40 minutes, ending with the spectacular release of a massive flock of 70,000 pigeons posing as \u201cpeace doves.\u201d\n\n\n\nXi\u2019s speech was 888 words long. He commanded the People\u2019s Liberation Army to uphold not just national sovereignty, security and prosperity, but also world peace. The Chinese soldiers were given a new role to safeguard world peace as if China was stepping up to replace the United States in the role of global police.\n\n\n\nWhat would Xi dream of? A recent column titled \u201cMan\u2019s world is mutable, seas become mulberry fields\u201d on the People\u2019s Daily suggests it. The column quoted Mao Zedong\u2019s famous poem, which he had written upon news of the Nanjing occupation seven decades ago, to envision the future of China.\n\n\n\nThe column boasted that over the last 70 years, China has developed without brutal capital accumulation or colonization. It achieved a broader and truer form of democracy for the people than the Western societies where political parties take turns to govern, the column said. The world again faces the crossroads for socialism and China will advance until it achieves perfect socialist society, it stressed. It sounds like a new Communist Party manifesto.\n\n\n\nAt the opposite side of Mao 70 years ago was Hu Shih, a propagator of American pragmatism and liberalism. On Jan. 2, 1949, he wrote in his diary that there was no use regretting for \u201cfailing to plant at high hills in the first place,\u201d referring to flooded mulberry fields alongside rivers. The United States may have to recite Shih\u2019s regret for reviving nationalism and socialism in China, particularly after a trade war with China.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
