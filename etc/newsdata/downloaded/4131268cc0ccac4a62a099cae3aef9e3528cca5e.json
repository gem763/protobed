A similar arrangement was rejected by Theresa May as a deal that no British prime minister could accept.\n\nJohnson will still have to win over parliament \u2013 including the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and the hardline Tory Brexiters, the European Research Group \u2013 on the basis that, under the deal, Northern Ireland will still legally be within the UK\u2019s customs territory.\n\n\u201cNorthern Ireland would de jure be in the UK\u2019s customs territory but de facto in the European Union\u2019s,\u201d one diplomatic source said of the tentative agreement.\n\nQuick guide Why is the Irish border a stumbling block for Brexit? Show Hide Counties and customs Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.\n\nBritain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety. The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland.

But as negotiations continue, there is nervousness in Paris and Berlin about the rush to find a deal for the EU27 leaders to sign off at Thursday\u2019s summit.\n\nSpeaking in Paris, a senior French official advised \u201cextreme prudence\u201d about the chances of a deal being struck that would satisfy the EU\u2019s capitals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the Irish who will make the deal. Yes, there are better atmospherics, but what matters is the content, and we have seen nothing yet. Whatever it is, we will want to look at it in very serious detail.\u201d\n\nGerman government officials said reaching a deal this week was an ambitious target and that agreeing on the technical issues could require another two months of talks unless the UK made significant enough concessions.\n\nThe Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, sought to reassure EU capitals fearful that a deal was being rushed.\n\n\u201cI would never ask the commission or the member states to compromise the single market, because our jobs and our economy and our security depends on that too,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to see how the next few days develop. If we can get to an agreement, on Thursday or Friday, and if the House of Commons is able to vote in favour of an indicative vote in favour of that agreement on Saturday it may not be necessary to even consider an extension.\u201d\n\nVaradkar expressed cautious optimism telling reporters in Ireland that \u201cinitial indications are that we are making progress, that the negotiations are moving in the right direction\u201d.\n\nIs a deal in sight? - Brexit Means ... podcast Read more\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Michel Barnier had set Johnson a midnight deadline to concede to EU demands and agree to a customs border in the Irish Sea or be left with nothing to take to the Commons.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator advised that the capitals would announce on Wednesday afternoon whether negotiations on an agreement would have to continue into next week.\n\nBarnier told the capitals that the starting point for a deal would be the Northern Ireland-only backstop, keeping the province in the EU\u2019s single market for goods and creating a customs border down the Irish Sea.\n\nQ&A What is a Northern Ireland-only backstop? Show Hide The British government\u2019s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements. Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament. If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop. Daniel Boffey\n\nAfter the meeting, Belgium\u2019s deputy prime minister, Didier Reynders, said: \u201cIf we have an agreement tonight it will be possible to go to the [European] council and then again to the British parliament. But it\u2019s not easy, we have some red lines, they are well known by all the partners. I\u2019m hoping it will be possible today to make some progress.\u201d\n\nIn a phone call with Johnson on Tuesday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, acknowledged the momentum towards reaching a deal, but raised the possible need for a \u201ctechnical\u201d Brexit extension beyond 31 October to allow talks to bear fruit.\n\nThe bloc has insisted the EU27 leaders will not negotiate when they meet. \u201cThe European council will be a political moment to tell the story, not to make detailed technical negotiations,\u201d said one French official. \u201cIt cannot be a catch-up. We do not do things urgently.\u201d\n\nThe thorny issue of how to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland has dogged the negotiations. The UK has accepted that Northern Ireland will remain in the EU\u2019s single market for goods, although it is seeking to find a way to time-limit the arrangement through a consent mechanism for Stormont.\n\nBarnier told ministers that the UK had dropped the original Stormont lock idea tabled by the prime minister on 1 October, which would have in effect given the DUP a veto on arrangements for avoiding a hard border coming into force and staying in force.\n\nUnder the new thinking, a majority of both nationalists and unionists would need to give consent at a point later in time.\n\nDowning Street last week accepted there would not be a customs border on the island of Ireland. The government has been seeking a way to avoid one in the Irish Sea on the basis that it would represent an economic dislocation of the country.\n\nBut the EU rejected the UK\u2019s proposal of a dual customs system at Northern Ireland\u2019s ports and airports that would involve tracking goods entering from Great Britain and applying differential treatment depending on their final destination.\n\nBarnier has instead pushed the UK to accept a model closer to a Northern Ireland-only backstop.\n\nUnder the deal being negotiated, Northern Ireland would not be part of the EU\u2019s customs territory, but the bloc\u2019s full customs code would have to be enforced in the Irish Sea.\n\nThe Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, who was also in Luxembourg and briefly met Barnier on Tuesday morning, had insisted a deal was \u201cstill very possible\u201d when speaking to reporters earlier. \u201cThe talks are ongoing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to give them space to proceed but detailed conversations are under way.\u201d\n\nPlay Video Michel Barnier says Brexit deal will be difficult but is 'still possible this week' \u2013 video\n\nSpeaking before his meeting with ministers, Barnier told reporters: \u201cThis work has been intense all over the weekend and yesterday, because even if the agreement will be difficult, more and more difficult to be frank, it is still possible this week \u2013 reaching an agreement is still possible, obviously any agreement must work for everyone, the whole of the UK and the whole of the EU. Let me add that it is also high time to turn good intentions into a legal text.\u201d", "description": "Negotiators understood to have agreed in principle to customs border down Irish Sea", "authors": ["Jon Henley", "Daniel Boffey", "Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/937596849031d67dea0dd34e8043b5ecf139c3cf/0_96_2117_1270/master/2117.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a68d58a95bea686d18031c5948640dda", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
