Elizabeth Warren \u2019s rally in Washington Square Park last week was a show of force in her competition with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for the votes of New York progressives, a side contest in the larger Democratic presidential primary.\n\nMs. Warren drew 20,000 people to the Monday night event, where she was introduced by Working Families Party National Director Maurice Mitchell. The progressive party backed Mr. Sanders in 2016, but announced its endorsement of his rival from Massachusetts that day.\n\nSome 20,000 people came to the Monday night event in Washington Square Park.\n\nBut Mr. Sanders still has a core of support, including thousands of volunteers who backed his 2016 campaign. They include the Democratic Socialists of America\u2019s New York branch and the New York Progressive Action Network, both of which are organizing for the senator.\n\n\u201cUntil there\u2019s a closing of ranks later on in the primary, they\u2019re just going to have to organize against each other, essentially,\u201d said New York state Sen. Julia Salazar, a Democrat and DSA member from Brooklyn.\n\nShe prefers Mr. Sanders to Ms. Warren because of Mr. Sanders\u2019s housing platform, and because she saw him as more committed to upend capitalist power structures than Ms. Warren. She said the WFP has previously based endorsements on a political calculus rather than ideology, and was puzzled by its decision. Some progressives were much harsher on Twitter .\n\nThere are clearly still supporters of Mr. Sanders in the party: WFP leaders said Ms. Warren won roughly 61% of its weighted vote, and 80% listed Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders as their top picks. A Siena College Research Institute poll last week showed Ms. Warren slightly ahead of Mr. Sanders among New York Democrats surveyed.\n\nNew York Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins spoke at the annual Business Council of New York State meeting.

While Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign announced nine additional endorsements last week, there were other politicians like New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams who attended her speech but weren\u2019t ready to commit.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Who do you think would be a stronger Democratic nominee, Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Williams, a former delegate for Mr. Sanders who won his office with WFP backing in a crowded special election, said the WFP endorsement of Ms. Warren was \u201chuge\u201d because the party intersected with most of the state\u2019s progressive organizations.\n\n\u201cI actually think it\u2019s a good problem to have. The last time we only had one person who was championing these ideas,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere should be a very strong debate, as long as we agree that we\u2019re going to come together at the end.\u201d\n\nBUSINESS OUTREACH: State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins made her first trip to the Business Council of New York state\u2019s annual meeting last week bearing a message of outreach.\n\nThe group, which represents employers around the state, has traditionally backed Republicans. Its leaders long warned that if the GOP lost control of the state Senate, an all-Democrat government would advance policies they had long resisted.\n\n\u201cI get it,\u201d Ms. Stewart-Cousins, of Yonkers, said at an opening reception. \u201cBut I hope that you get that we\u2019re not against business. We understand that our viability, our status as New York depends on your success.\u201d\n\nShe mentioned legislative action that made permanent the state\u2019s 2% cap on property tax increases, a major Business Council priority that had previously been championed by Senate Republicans. No GOP senators attended this year\u2019s conference, held at an island resort in Lake George, N.Y.\n\nDemocrats this year passed bills strengthening tenant protections, making it easier to bring sexual-harassment claims against businesses and granting labor protections to farmworkers. And Amazon.com Inc. scrapped plans for a headquarters campus in Queens in part because of opposition from Ms. Stewart-Cousins\u2019 deputy, Sen. Mike Gianaris. An aide to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has been endorsed by the group, brought this up at the conference on Thursday as he laid out the governor\u2019s priorities.\n\nBut the business council\u2019s president, Heather Briccetti, said Ms. Stewart-Cousins\u2019 speech resonated, and the senator received a standing ovation.\n\n\u201cI am excited, frankly, about engaging you in ways you never would have believed you would be able to engage with Democrats,\u201d Ms. Stewart-Cousins said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to give you an opportunity to get used to it.\u201d\n\nTHE QUESTION: Which New York town doubled in population on Sunday?\n\n\u2014 Know the answer? Leave a comment!\n\nTHE LAST ANSWER: New York last held its presidential and legislative primaries on the same day in 1972, when South Dakota Sen. George McGovern bested his rivals before winning the Democratic Party nomination. (He lost to Richard Nixon. )\n\nNew York last concluded its legislative session before Memorial Day in 1970, when lawmakers adjourned on April 20, according to the Red Book, an almanac of New York political information.\n\nWrite to Jimmy Vielkind at Jimmy.Vielkind@wsj.com", "description": "Elizabeth Warren\u2019s rally in Washington Square Park last week was a show of force in her competition with Bernie Sanders for the votes of New York progressives, a side contest in the larger Democratic presidential primary.", "authors": ["Jimmy Vielkind", "Jimmy.Vielkind Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109294/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
