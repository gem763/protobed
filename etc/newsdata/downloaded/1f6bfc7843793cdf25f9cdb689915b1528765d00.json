The book is a collection of letters addressed to her daughters and is out now.\n\nDear Girls, in case I die suddenly, this is very important information I want to pass down to you, more crucial than money or love. This might be the most important lesson in this book. Being able to select a great Asian restaurant is a big source of pride for me. It\u2019s what our family does together on the weekends. Life is too short to be wasting meals on bad food, and I would feel deep shame if I ever caught one of you eating at a gross Asian restaurant. I\u2019d rather catch you trafficking cocaine into Thailand through any number of orifices than see you eating at a P.F. Chang\u2019s. General rule of thumb: 99 percent of the clientele should be Asian. If you see groups of old Asian women there, that\u2019s a very, very good sign.\n\nFrom the book DEAR GIRLS: Intimate Tales, Untold Secrets & Advice for Living Your Best Life by Ali Wong.
