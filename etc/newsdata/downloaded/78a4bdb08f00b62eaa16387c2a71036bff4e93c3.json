He is getting better playing minutes, playing matches, scoring goals like tonight. He helped us tonight to win the match.\"\n\nContinuing in his post-match press conference, Emery said the 15 minutes Pepe played were 'perfect', and admitted the 24-year-old had been practising his set-pieces.\n\n\"New players usually need time for that adaptation and Pepe is a good player we believe in totally,\" he added.\n\n\"He\u2019s improving and tonight his two goals were very important. Pepe was perfect and finished this match which we deserved to win. We are very happy for him.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"He was trying a lot of set pieces last week and I was expecting him to shoot after that. I think the most important is the three points and how individual players can improve.\"\n\nIt was a perfect response for Arsenal following the disappointment of their 1-0 loss to Sheffield United on Monday, and they will now try to continue the momentum when they take on Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday.", "description": "The Gunners winger came off the bench to score two free-kicks and help Arsenal to a 3-2 win over Vitoria in the Europa League", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20719082.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Europa-League-Group-F-Arsenal-v-Vitoria-SC.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
