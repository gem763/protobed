Laura Kuenssberg has quoted a no 10 source on Twitter that talks in Brussels are \u201cclose to breaking down\u201d with the political editor for the BBC stating that it feels like any chance of a deal this month just died.\n\nGiven the lukewarm reaction to the government\u2019s proposals last week this shouldn\u2019t come as too much of a surprise, and now it seems increasingly likely that we get a general election almost solely focused on Brexit before the year is out.\n\nThe is trading lower against all its peers on the day and is back near its lowest level of the month against the US dollar, trading around 1.2250 last.\n\nLSE shares slide after takeover bid dropped\n\nThe worst performing blue-chip in London this morning is the London Stock Exchange Group PLC (LON: ) with shares falling by as much as 6% after Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Ltd (HK: ) announced it would drop its \u00a332B takeover offer. Shares in LSE have surged higher in recent months as speculation mounted that a takeover was on the cards, but given the current political disruption in Hong Kong it always seemed at least a tad optimistic to think this would go through without some serious resistance. There\u2019s been a clear trend of consolidation amongst the world\u2019s largest trading exchanges in recent years and while this latest attempt has come up short, it would not be too surprising for the LSE to be subject to further takeover interest going forward - especially if the pound remains at the current depressed levels that make the valuation more attractive to foreign investors.", "description": "Forex Analysis by XTB (David Cheetham) covering: GBP/USD, London Stock Exchange Group PLC, Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Ltd.
