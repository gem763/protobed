Trump\u2019s communications with Giuliani, for several reasons, may not be protected.\n\nAD\n\nThe attorney-client privilege shields confidential communications between a lawyer and a client, so long as they were made for the purpose of giving legal advice.\n\nAD\n\n\u2018He\u2019s wild as a March hare\u2019: Republicans decline to defend Rudy Giuliani\n\nGiuliani\u2019s first problem is that he has called the representation into question.\n\nThrough much of the Trump presidency, Giuliani held himself out as the president\u2019s personal attorney.\n\nWhen he announced a trip to Kiev in May, Giuliani planned to encourage the new administration to probe connections related to former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The reason, he told the New York Times, was \u201cbecause that information will be very, very helpful to my client.\u201d Giuliani canceled his trip after the story was published.\n\nAD\n\nRecently, however, he has said the opposite \u2014 that he views himself acting not as a lawyer but as an emissary. During an interview with the Atlantic last week, he said of his work in Ukraine: \u201cI\u2019m not acting as a lawyer. I\u2019m acting as someone who has devoted most of his life to straightening out government.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut even if a court decided that Giuliani was operating as an attorney, the privilege applies only to communications between a lawyer and a client for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.\n\nIt does not protect any conversation Giuliani may have had with the president of Ukraine or any other foreign official, even if Trump was on the phone. It\u2019s unlikely that Giuliani\u2019s conversations with State Department officials or attorneys, of which he recently said he possessed records, would be privileged, too.\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani did not respond to a request for comment for this report.\n\nThe privilege requires an attorney to be providing confidential legal advice \u2014 and therefore does not shield a client\u2019s directive to his attorney for nonlegal work such as persuading a foreign government to investigate a political opponent.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen a client tells his lawyer, hypothetically, \u2018Go off to the Ukraine and do X, Y and Z for me\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s not happening for the purpose of obtaining legal advice,\u201d said Kathleen Clark, an expert in government legal ethics who serves on the D.C. Bar\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct Review Committee. \u201cThat\u2019s the client asking his agent or henchman to do something. Even if you purported to be acting as a lawyer, the privilege has no application.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nExecutive privilege, on the other hand, is a nonstarter. It arises only by working in the government. Thus, as the president\u2019s personal attorney, Giuliani could not claim executive privilege through Trump.\n\nMuch of the information sought by Congress falls outside of the attorney-client privilege, but assuming there were some remaining communications over which Giuliani wanted to invoke it, the law is unclear whether Congress could pose another obstacle.\n\nAD\n\nSome legal experts have said that Congress does not recognize the attorney-client privilege because it is a common-law privilege, and Congress has authority, by statute, to override federal common law.\n\nAD\n\nThat reasoning is not correct, said Daniel Capra, a leading expert in evidence and legal ethics at Fordham University School of Law. It is a statute that establishes the federal law of privileges, by incorporating federal common law.\n\n\u201cAs far as I have been able to find, there is no court case that has decided the issue. But there are indeed examples in which a congressional investigation takes the position that it need not respect attorney-client privilege,\u201d Capra said, adding that any dispute has been settled or determined on other grounds.\n\nEthically speaking, an attorney is required to invoke privilege before a congressional investigation, unless the client has waived it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe lawyer has a duty to preserve confidences,\u201d Capra said, calling it \u201ca colorable claim\u201d so long as \u201cthere is not some other consideration that makes the claim frivolous \u2014 like there was no legal work being done.\u201d\n\nIncluding a third party in an otherwise privileged communication generally results in a waiver of privilege, Roy Simon, professor emeritus of legal ethics at Hofstra Law, told The Washington Post. Under the law, \u201cconfidential\u201d means that the only people privy to the communication are the client, attorney and maybe an agent (such as a secretary, paralegal or interpreter). By adding another person to the conversation who was not the client\u2019s agent, courts have held that the client waived attorney-client privilege.\n\n\u201cConversations with anyone from the Ukraine are not privileged. You cannot ward off a subpoena just by saying it was \u2019confidential,\u2019 because none of those individuals are agents of Donald Trump,\u201d Simon said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRudy Giuliani\u2019s remarkable Ukraine interview, annotated\n\nThere is also the crime-fraud exception to privilege. A court can pierce the privilege if a client is attempting to use the attorney to commit a crime, said Ellen Yaroshefsky, a professor of legal ethics at Hofstra. To prove that the exception applies, there must be evidence of the crime or fraud other than the documents or records sought. Given the information that has come to light surrounding potential criminal conduct such as campaign finance violations or extortion, the exception is a viable possibility.\n\nThe attorney-client privilege can\u2019t be used as a sword and a shield, Lawrence Fox, former chairman of the ABA Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, told The Post.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s situation presents myriad issues \u2014 most saliently that he was acting as a fixer and doing nonlawyer work and that other people were present, defeating the privilege.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get the privilege just by having a lawyer there,\u201d Fox said. \u201cLawyers only seek to enforce the privilege when it\u2019s clear you have a legitimate representation. If lawyers abuse it, courts can take it away from us.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nNow that there\u2019s an impeachment inquiry, what\u2019s going to happen to guns, the border and prescription drugs?\n\nThe IG, in an \u2018urgent\u2019 briefing on the Hill, called out politicization and harassment at State Department this summer\n\nWhat can Congress do if Mike Pompeo won\u2019t cooperate with its impeachment inquiry?\n\nBarr\u2019s probing of Australia, Britain and Italy suggests a conspiracy focus", "description": "Was Rudolph Giuliani acting as the president\u2019s lawyer?
