A single insecure library loading vulnerability, CVE-2019-8076, has been found in the Windows version of the installer that can be exploited to permit DLL hijacking.\n\nCNET: Mozilla tests Firefox VPN service to help protect your privacy\n\n\"This vulnerability exclusively impacts the installer used with the Adobe Application Manager,\" Adobe said. \"CVE-2019-8076 does not impact the existing Application Manager, and there is no action for customer[s] running earlier versions.\"\n\nAdobe thanked Hamdi Maamri, Eduardo Braun Prado, and the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative for reporting the vulnerabilities. It is recommended that users either allow automatic updates or upgrade their builds via the product's update mechanism.\n\nIn August, Adobe resolved security problems in a variety of software.
