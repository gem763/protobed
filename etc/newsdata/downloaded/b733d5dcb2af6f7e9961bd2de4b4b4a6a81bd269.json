Greggs needs imports of milk and butter from Ireland for its pastry and drinks. Faced with sterling\u2019s depreciation against the euro since 2016, and with new administrative costs from the Brexit-induced border changes, it has little scope to pass on price rises to a clientele with limited purchasing power.\n\nThe chain\u2019s trading update also revealed that the buzz from its vegan sausage rolls, a British coda on the much-hyped Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: ) IPO earlier in the year, is fading somewhat. Sales growth slowed to 12.4% in the third quarter, down from over 15% at the start of the year, while like-for-like sales growth slowed to 9.4% from over 11%. Those figures are set to lose even more luster in the final quarter, thanks to a strong set of comparatives from a year earlier.\n\nThe management has turned conservative as the economy has slowed this year under the pressure of repeated Brexit deadlines. Greggs now expects only 90 net store openings this year, down from 100 at its latest update three months ago. It repeated long-standing concerns about pressures on both food input and labor costs.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares fell 6.6% after Tuesday\u2019s update, although they\u2019re due a correction after a 60% increase since the start of the year \u2013 and they\u2019re still one of the best-performing stocks in the sector in Europe this year, ahead of brewers AB Inbev (BR: ) and Carlsberg (OTC: ), and defensive stalwarts such as Nestle (SIX: ) and Unilever (LON: ).\n\nElsewhere, European indexes lost some early gains Tuesday as a raft of depressing-looking underlined the bleak near-term outlook for the European economy, overshadowing the benefits of an even cheaper euro and pound. Ironically, the return of Brexit-related stockpiling led the to beat expectations, although at 48.3 it remained clearly in contraction territory.\n\nThe was down 0.2% by 5:15 AM ET, while the was down 0.1% and the German was effectively unchanged.", "description": "StockBeat: Brexit Crunch Time Is Bad News for Greggs", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC202A8_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
