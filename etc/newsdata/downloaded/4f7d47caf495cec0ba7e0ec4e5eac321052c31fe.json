Pollock and Cody Bellinger converge to start the celebration after the Dodgers beat Baltimore, 7-3, to clinch their seventh straight NL West title. (Nick Wass/AP)\n\nEntering the 2019 campaign, no pitcher had better handled the behemoth Los Angeles Dodgers than Ty Blach.\n\nAs the Dodgers collected the latter half of what before Tuesday was six straight National League West titles \u2014 twice following that achievement with a National League pennant \u2014 the left-handed Blach was one of only two pitchers to throw at least 50 innings against Los Angeles from 2016 to 2018 with a sub-3.00 ERA. The Arizona Diamondbacks\u2019 Robbie Ray still had an ERA nearly a full run higher than Blach\u2019s 1.88 mark in that span.\n\nBut after the Baltimore Orioles\u2019 7-3 loss to the Dodgers on Tuesday at Camden Yards, Blach\u2019s career ERA against Los Angeles was up to 3.57, and his ERA in his five-start tenure with Baltimore rose to 11.32. Blach, the former San Francisco Giant, allowed six runs in 2\u2153 innings, serving as the losing pitcher in a game that clinched a seventh straight NL West title for the Dodgers (94-52) and was the Orioles\u2019 sixth consecutive defeat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been one of those years,\u201d Blach said. \u201cI just feel like [I\u2019m] leaving a couple of pitches over the plate maybe and they\u2019re just taking advantage of some pitches they can leverage. But they\u2019re a good hitting team.\u201d\n\n[Box score: Dodgers 7, Orioles 3]\n\nAfter Blach struck out A.J. Pollock to open the night, the next three Dodgers reached, with Cody Bellinger\u2019s RBI single providing an early lead. A batter later, Corey Seager deposited Blach\u2019s 36th pitch into the right-center field stands for a three-run home run.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was making a lot of good pitches,\u201d Blach said. \u201cThey just kept battling and kept fouling pitches off and got me deep into counts.\u201d\n\nIn the third, Seager swatted his second home run, a two-run shot, to left. Blach departed two batters later. He left the game with 13 earned runs surrendered to the Dodgers in 5\u2154 innings this year.\n\nRookie Gavin Lux followed Seager\u2019s pair with his first career home run in the fifth, coming off Tanner Scott to give Los Angeles a 7-0 lead. The homers brought the Orioles to 164 allowed at Camden Yards, a major league record for most given up at home. Including the two games left in this series, The Orioles (46-98) have eight home contests left and would have to go 7-1 or better to avoid matching or passing last year\u2019s home record for the worst in the franchise\u2019s 65-year stay in Baltimore.\n\nThe offense was not blameless in the defeat, though scoring even a handful of runs against rising Dodgers ace Walker Buehler is a difficult task. After the Orioles recorded consecutive two-out singles in the second, Buehler struck out the next four and retired eight straight overall. Baltimore did not get another batter to second base in his seven innings, as he struck out 11 and allowed just four hits and no walks.\n\n\u2014 Baltimore Sun", "description": "Los Angeles hands Baltimore a sixth straight loss and earns a seventh division flag ina row.", "authors": ["Nathan Ruiz", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1hrx8uUIsKaUajq6wDBYWRsvKWo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PCTRWMGUIMI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
