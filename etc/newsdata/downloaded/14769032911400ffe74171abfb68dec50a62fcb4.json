Biden is a front-runner in the Democratic race to challenge Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nThe acting DNI, whom Trump appointed to lead the U.S. intelligence community last month, said that he has \u201cevery reason to believe\u201d the complainant, an unidentified U.S. intelligence official. He also said that Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for U.S. spy agencies, \u201cfollowed the law\u201d in handling the complaint, which alleges that the White House tried to hide Trump\u2019s attempts to get Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election.\n\nAtkinson told Maguire in a letter dated Aug. 26 that he found the complaint \u201ccredible\u201d and of \u201curgent concern.\u201d The law required Maguire to hand over the complaint to congressional intelligence committees within seven days. But he didn\u2019t release it until Wednesday night, days after he took it to the White House to review first.\n\nHouse Democrats on Thursday grilled Maguire over his decision to withhold the complaint for so long, suggesting that lawmakers might never have seen it had Atkinson not alerted them of its existence.\n\n\u201cThe first people that you go to after you read that allegation are the White House lawyers who are telling the White House officials who see this transcript to move it into a secret compartmentalized system,\u201d Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) asked. \u201cIs that yes or no?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Maguire said, adding that he felt obligated to check with the White House first because the complaint was \u201cunique\u201d and \u201cunprecedented.\u201d He said he wasn\u2019t sure whether the complaint fit the legal definition of \u201curgent concern,\u201d as Atkinson had been.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint alleges that senior White House officials \u201cintervened to lock down all records\u201d of Trump\u2019s July phone call with Zelensky. These officials were directed by White House lawyers to remove a transcript of the call from the computer system where such transcripts are typically stored and place it in a separate computer system meant to handle classified information, the complaint alleges.\n\nAsked Thursday if he would like to know whether the White House is hiding transcripts of conversations with foreign leaders, Maguire didn\u2019t give a straight answer.\n\n\u201cHow the White House, the Executive Office of the President and the National Security Council conduct their business is their business,\u201d he said.\n\nSwalwell continued to press Maguire: \u201cIf there\u2019s cover-up activity because the president is working improperly with a foreign government, that could compromise America\u2019s secrets. Is that right?\u201d\n\n\u201cCongressman, there is an allegation of a cover-up,\u201d Maguire responded. \u201cI\u2019m sure an investigation ... before this committee might lay credence or disprove that.\u201d\n\nActing DNI Maguire: \"How the White House, the executive office of the president and the national security council conduct their business is their business.\"\n\n\n\nRep. Swalwell: \"Well, it's actually your business to protect America's secrets, is that right?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's all of ours.\" pic.twitter.com/9GN3OkTVMm \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 26, 2019", "description": "Testifying before the House Intelligence Committee, he defended his decision to take the complaint to the White House first.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8cd4942100005f005e8b06.jpeg?cache=xsrwnzpsjl&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
