Or he could apologize or he could say, \u2018I don\u2019t really know what Bruce Lee was like. I just wrote it for my movie. But that shouldn\u2019t be taken as how he really was.\u2019\u201d\n\nAndrew Cooper/Sony Pictures Mike Moh plays the Asian American legend and Brad Pitt stars as Cliff Booth.\n\nIn one particularly cringeworthy scene, the martial artist, played by Mike Moh, challenges stunt man Cliff Booth, portrayed by Brad Pitt, to a fight. The martial artist ultimately serves as a narrative vehicle to show that Booth is still a worthy stuntman even though his career appears to be fizzling out.\n\nUpon seeing the movie, Lee said that it had illustrated her father as an \u201carrogant punching bag\u201d and told The Wrap that \u201cit was really uncomfortable to sit in the theater and listen to people laugh at my father.\u201d\n\nTarantino doubled down on his controversial take at a press conference in Moscow, during which he said that \u201cBruce Lee was kind of an arrogant guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way he was talking, I didn\u2019t just make a lot of that up. I heard him say things like that, to that effect. If people are saying, \u2018Well he never said he could beat up Muhammad Ali.\u2019 Well, yeah, he did,\u201d he said before misattributing a quote to the legend\u2019s wife. \u201cNot only did he say that, but his wife, Linda Lee, said that in her first biography I ever read. She absolutely said that.\u201d\n\nVariety notes that the passage Tarantino appears to refer to in Linda Lee\u2019s biography, \u201cBruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew,\u201d had in fact been citing a TV critic who wrote that \u201cthose who watched [Bruce] Lee would bet on Lee to render Cassius Clay senseless.\u201d\n\nBruce Lee remains a critical figure for Asian Americans, particularly men, who\u2019ve long been emasculated in Hollywood roles. The actor represented strength, and through his mastery of craft, avoided being relegated to the nerdy, sexless tropes that existed for Asian men at the time. Moh himself had idolized the star growing up. As senior reporter Brittany Wong writes in HuffPost, \u201cLee was the Asian American hero \u2015 the only one. Here, by the grace of the film gods, was a cocksure, ass-kicking, philosophy-spouting action star who actually looked like them.\u201d", "description": "Shannon Lee is speaking out about the director's depiction of her father.", "authors": ["Asian-American Affairs Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d4096d92400009d17936f2f.jpeg?cache=qugz84t4zz&ops=1778_1000"}
