A transitional government was installed in August following months of protests that led to the military ousting Bashir.\n\nInclusion on the list makes Sudan ineligible for desperately needed debt relief and financing from lenders like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Removal would potentially open the door for foreign investment.\n\nA senior U.S. official said in August that the country would test the commitment of Sudan\u2019s new transitional government to human rights, freedom of speech and humanitarian access before it agrees to remove the country from the state sponsor of terrorism list.\n\nHamdok said last month he had held useful talks with U.S. officials on the topic and expressed hope that an agreement could be reached \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia is also working on initiating investments in Sudan and improving existing projects, the tweet said, adding that Sudan was seeking Saudi Arabia\u2019s support in international forums and wanted to provide an environment for investment and expand its agricultural sector.\n\nSoon after Bashir was toppled in April, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced $3 billion worth of aid in the form of a deposit to the central bank, food, medicine, and petroleum products.", "description": "Saudi Arabia is working to remove Sudan from the United States' list of state sponsors of terrorism, a Saudi foreign ministry tweet said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
