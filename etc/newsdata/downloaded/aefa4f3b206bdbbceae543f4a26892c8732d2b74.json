He\u2019s just moving them to other parts of the Middle East.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cHe\u2019s moving troops back into Iraq. He\u2019s moving other troops into Saudi Arabia and he\u2019s using our forces almost as mercenaries, paid mercenaries who are going to go in as long as Saudi Arabia pays us money, it\u2019s good to go.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat happened to the American people having their voices heard through their representatives in Congress? We should make those decisions in Congress, and frankly, we have been in the Middle East for way too long. We have been in Afghanistan for obviously way too long and we should bring people home.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Sunday's broadcast of NBC's \"Meet The Press,\" Rep.
