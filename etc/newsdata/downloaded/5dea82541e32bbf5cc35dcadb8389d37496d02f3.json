(Mandel Ngan/Pool via REUTERS)\n\nIran warned the United States that it would broadly retaliate against any attacks in the wake of crippling strikes on the Saudi oil industry over the weekend, Iranian news agencies reported Wednesday.\n\nThe message, which was sent via the Swiss Embassy in Tehran that handles U.S. affairs in the country, condemned remarks by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other officials linking Iran with the attacks on a Saudi oil field and processing facility.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s response will be prompt and strong, and it may include broader areas than the source of attacks,\u201d the Mehr News Agency reported the official note as saying.\n\nIran\u2019s Fars News Agency said any response would be \u201crapid and crushing\u201d and target \u201cmore extensive areas than the origin of the attack.\u201d There have long been fears that Iranian proxy forces in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and elsewhere might attack U.S. forces in the region.\n\nYemeni Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for Saturday\u2019s attacks, which temporarily cut Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production in half and sent prices spiking around the world. U.S. officials, however, have cast doubt on the rebels\u2019 involvement, saying that the attacks were too sophisticated for them to have carried out.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Defense Ministry said it would reveal new evidence of Iran\u2019s involvement in a news conference scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nPompeo, meanwhile, is set to arrive Wednesday in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, where he will meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss the recent attacks and coordinate on countering Iran.\n\nPresident Trump has not blamed Iran directly for the attacks, however, pending an investigation of the incident and has said he would \u201clike to avoid\u201d a war.\n\nThe chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., told reporters in London that Iran or its allies were likely involved. He said U.S. military officials are reviewing how they could \u201chelp the Saudis defend themselves.\u201d\n\nInvestigators from the United States as well as France have been dispatched to oil processing facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais to determine the origins of the projectiles that slammed into them.\n\nThe attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure were the most serious in decades and far outstripped any past attacks by the Houthis on Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe rebels have been battling a Saudi-led coalition backing the internationally recognized government in Yemen since 2015. The conflict has caused the world\u2019s most severe humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn remarks to his cabinet, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the Houthi rebels were only responding to years of attacks and airstrikes.\n\n\u201cThe Yemeni nation was not the source of the conflict, but it was Saudi Arabia, the UAE, the Americans,\u201d he said, according to Iranian media.\n\nAt the same cabinet meeting, Iran\u2019s defense minister, Brig. Gen. Amir Hatami, denied that Tehran had any role in the attack. He noted that \u201cthe Yemenis carried out a similar operation around two years ago.\u201d\n\nThe tensions in the region center on a rivalry between Saudi Arabia and regional heavyweight Iran, especially in the Persian Gulf, a key international waterway for oil shipments. The United Arab Emirates is allied with the Saudis in that confrontation.\n\nThe United States has said Iran is behind a strong of attacks on ships moving through those water over the summer \u2014 a charge Iran denies.\n\nRead more\n\nPompeo making spur-of-the-moment trip to Mideast as Iran rules out talks\n\nBillions spent on U.S. weapons didn\u2019t protect Saudi Arabia\u2019s most critical oil sites from a crippling attack\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is headed to Saudi Arabia to discuss the brewing crisis.", "authors": ["Paul Schemm", "Overnight Foreign Editor Based In Addis Ababa", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mR_PDOyjt0PQDDk26YTqu4bFS4c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UPGTMCGZ7YI6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
