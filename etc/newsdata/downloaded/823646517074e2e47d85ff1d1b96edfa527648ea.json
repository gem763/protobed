Had they been, air prices would typically be \u00a320 higher.\n\nAs well as the LNER route from London to Edinburgh, there is an alternative direct rail journey on Virgin Trains from London Euston at 6.43am. Advance tickets between the English and Scottish capitals are priced at \u00a3143.\n\nYet using a cheaper route from Euston to Crewe and combining it with that very same Virgin train to the Scottish capital reduces the cost to just \u00a342 \u2013 undercutting the plane and all other train options.\n\nIt involves taking the train from the adjacent platform at London Euston: the 6.28am to Crewe.\n\nThis leg, on London Northwestern, costs just \u00a39. The train reaches the Cheshire station in just over two hours, with eight intermediate stops. It still arrives in Crewe before the 6.43am from Euston, which travels a longer route via the West Midlands.\n\nThe second part of the journey requires an Advance ticket on Virgin Trains from Crewe to Edinburgh for \u00a333.\n\nThe overall journey takes 5 hours 54 minutes, around 90 minutes longer than the East Coast main line served by LNER. But the saving represents around 34p per minute.\n\nAnyone holding a railcard can reduce the cost of their train journey by around one-third \u2013 taking the fare for London-Edinburgh to below \u00a328.\n\nThat undercuts the cheapest bus fares, with National Express at \u00a329.70 and Megabus at \u00a333.20. But these journeys take around 10 hours, roughly double the time of the rail journey.\n\nThe Independent also investigated the cheapest route via a third country: Norwegian from Gatwick via Copenhagen to Edinburgh, for a fare of \u00a3183 \u2013 more than four times the cheapest train option.\n\nMark Smith, the international rail expert know as The Man in Seat 61, said: \u201cTrain and plane seem neck and neck on price. But there\u2019s the significant extra cost of train or tram to and from the airport at each end, and there may be baggage fees as well.\n\n\u201cOver the last few years Anglo-Scottish trains have been taking market share back from planes as journey time has been cut and frequency improved. London-Edinburgh is almost half hourly now for much of the day.\n\n\u201cThe desire to cut CO2 emissions is also driving people to switch. But it\u2019s clearly always worth checking whether a \u2018split ticket\u2019 could save money.\u201d\n\nAn LNER spokesperson said: \u201cOur new Azuma trains are already helping bring thousands of extra seats between Edinburgh and London with train travel always kinder to the environment than flying.\u201d\n\nThe government-run train operator has conducted research on fares for next-day travel from London to Edinburgh and claims the average saving travelling by rail rather than air is \u00a346.47.\n\nFares were researched at 12 noon on Monday 16 September for travel from London to Edinburgh the following morning. These are the cheapest fares found:", "description": "Trains beat planes for short-notice bookings between London and Edinburgh \u2013 but only if the passenger does a bit of work.
