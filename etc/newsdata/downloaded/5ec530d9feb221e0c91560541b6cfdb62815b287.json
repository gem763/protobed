Jason Chuck, the chief consumer officer of listings company Domain - majority owned by Nine, publisher of The Australian Financial Review - told last month's AFR Property Summit that developers had been burnt before when they put in home-control technology hardware that was subsequently overtaken by cloud computing.\n\n\"When you look at technology being built into a building, just a few years ago, on the residential side, everyone was putting in a [hardwired] c-bus [control],\" Mr Chuck said.\n\n\"They were looking at how you prewire all your AV and all the various pipes you needed to put in. Now everything\u2019s in the cloud.\"\n\nPart of the hesitation to spend may also lie in Australia's physical distance from some of the world's biggest tech producers, JLL's Mr Taggart said.\n\n\u201cA lot of tech initiatives are driven by the US and Europe. We like to see things evolve naturally in Australia and Asia,\u201d Mr Taggart said.\n\nDespite this, more than one-third of Australian real estate companies considered themselves early adopters of new technology, compared with 25 per cent globally. As much as 36 per cent of the respondents said tech was a top investment priority in the next three years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost one-third said workspace and employee experience technology was a priority, compared to 30 per cent globally. Australians were particularly interested in investing IT services linked to pay, annual leave, meeting room bookings and locating staff within a building.\n\n\u201cThe solutions are there, but Australians are less into rolling them out on a large scale,\" Mr Taggart said.\n\n\"In a portfolio of 30 buildings, perhaps only half will have the new\n\ntechnology. People expect to measure a result based on a small sample of their portfolio, and that\u2019s part of the problem.\"\n\nMr Taggart said investment in commercial real estates technology would help companies track data such as energy consumption across their portfolio.\n\n\u201cThey can see a direct correlation between spending money and saving money,\" he said.", "description": "Australian corporate real estate companies aren't spending on IT systems out of fear the new technology will be superseded.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1fffe94863d11316934ce00121ecd126759f36af", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
