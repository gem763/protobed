He started to paint during the party and continued to work on it over the following two weeks.\n\nThe images on the truck show the silhouette of a male figure swinging a hammer towards metal cogs, with flying monkeys and red stars on the background. Across the back end and the reverse side of the truck are a group of soldiers running away from a cannon. The title, Laugh Now But One Day We\u2019ll Be in Charge is stenciled above the soldiers\u2019 heads, with the word \u201ccharge\u201d in large letters.\n\n\u201cBanksy is arguably the most important artist to have emerged since the millennium and this, his largest commercial work, represents a new high watermark of quality for works of his to appear at auction,\u201d said Ralph Taylor, Bonhams global head of post-war and contemporary art, in a statement. \u201cThe composition bears all the hallmarks of this peerless agentprovocateur.\u201d (French for \u201cinciting agent\u201d)\n\nThe truck then spent the next years traveling throughout Europe, and as far away as South America, as part of Turbozone\u2019s Cinderella show, Bonhams said. The piece is featured in Banksy\u2019s book, Wall and Piece, published in 2006.\n\nThe title of the piece is stenciled above the soldiers' heads. Courtesy of Bonhams\n\nIt is being offered for sale at a Bonhams motor car auction, the Goodwood Revival sale, on Sept. 13. The truck is accompanied by a Certificate of Authentication issued by Pest Control, Banksy\u2019s studio.\n\nBanksy is the foremost graffiti artist in the world, with his work adorning streets, walls, and bridges across nations and continents. He rose to international fame in the mid-2000s. His first London exhibition, Crude Oils, in 2005, took aim at the established art world. In 2006, he broke into Hollywood with his show Barely Legal in Los Angeles, Calif., which was attended by stars such as Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Dennis Hopper, and Cameron Diaz.\n\nOne of Banksy's most famous stunts involves his painting, Girl With Balloon, whichsold for\u00a31.04 million at Sotheby\u2019s London in October 2018. A mechanism triggered the painting to self-shred in the middle of the live auction and created a new piece, titled Love in the Bin (2018).", "description": "A Volvo truck covered in graffiti could fetch \u00a31.5 million at Bonhams London", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-102972/social"}
