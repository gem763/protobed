Hey EA Sports...who is this guy?\"\n\nEA's video game rivals Konami were quick to jump on Ribery's tweet to get one over on the competition.\n\nThey responded to the 36-year-old with a screenshot of him from their own Pro Evolution Soccer (PES) 20 game, displaying a clearer likeness, and said: \"Hey Franck! Do you know who this guy is?\"\n\nGoal report that one possible reason for the difference between the two games is that PES have exclusive rights to Serie A this season.\n\nAs such, clubs in the division are displayed with different names on FIFA 20, like Juventus are referred to as Piemonte Calcio.\n\nWithout the licence it is thought that Konami will have had the opportunity to use more resources to develop the image of players based in Italy.\n\nRibery has got off to a decent start with his new club since his move, producing two goals and one assist in his seven appearances.\n\nHowever he could well have ended up in the Premier League, after admitting there was interest in him from English clubs.\n\n\"I had other contacts, in England and also in Italy, but there was a spark with the Fiorentina executives,\" Ribery told Corriere della Serra .\n\n\"When I agreed to come to Florence I couldn't know that it would be love at first sight, but that's how it has been since the evening of the presentation. That night was special and I will always carry it with me.\"", "description": "The Fiorentina winger's appearance on the game bares little resemblance to him in real life - much to his disappointment", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Sipa Usa Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645859.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Italy-ACF-Fiorentina-Udinese.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
