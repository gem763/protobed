Southwest and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nHughes sued on behalf of Southwest passengers who incurred hotel, food and other costs because of flight cancellations at Chicago's Midway Airport on six days from Dec. 8, 2017 to Feb. 11, 2018.\n\nHe said Southwest canceled 250 flights to and from Midway on Feb. 11, including his scheduled flight from Phoenix, because it ran out of de-icer fluid, which no other carrier had done.\n\nHughes said was forced to fly instead to Omaha, Nebraska and stay overnight, returning to Chicago on Feb. 12.\n\nIn seeking a dismissal, Southwest said it could not control the weather, and its passenger contracts allowed it to cancel flights because of bad weather \"when necessary or advisable.\"\n\nThe case is Hughes v Southwest Airlines Co, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 18-5315.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)", "description": "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis in Chicago ruled on Tuesday that Southwest's ticketing terms did not imply that the Dallas-based carrier had a legal duty to always stock enough fluid.  \"Running out of de-icer implicates aviation safety, regardless of whether it was a foreseeable event,\"", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZoMo0kxOehztxWr_OTz.NA--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NDk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters-finance.com/91b47e03fc52e42781b51d4ac2de07c2", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
