Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) closed its 370,000 b/d Beaumont refinery on Thursday due to flooding. However, the floods have been nowhere near as severe as Hurricane Harvey two years ago, which knocked 4 million barrels a day of refining capacity offline.\n\nElsewhere, Saudi Aramco repeated its assurances Friday that it will have 11 million barrels a day of capacity back online by the end of the month, well above its current actual output level. However, reports that the country is buying Iraqi crude in order to help it guarantee its short-term customer obligations have left lingering doubts about the Saudi supply outlook.\n\nThose doubts, in turn, create an incentive for others to full a supply gap, analysts say. Rystad Energy expects Iraq to raise its output by 30,000 barrels a day in response to the current situation.\n\nMuch is riding on the kingdom's ability to recover from the initial attack and protect itself from future ones.\n\n\"A sustained oil price increase of $10 - $20 per barrel could cut global growth by 0.1\u20130.2 percentage point,\" said IHS Markit chief economist Nariman Behravesh in a research note. \" While the damage of an oil shock to the US economy will be much less than in the past, the harm to large net oil-importing economies such as China, Japan, and Europe could be significant.\"\n\nAmong other products Friday, gasoline futures were down 0.5% at $1.6929 a barrel, while natgas futures were up 0.4% at $2.547 per 10,000 MMBtu.", "description": "Oil Prices Up but Range-Bound as Trump Plots Next Move on Iran", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPECAG1CT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
