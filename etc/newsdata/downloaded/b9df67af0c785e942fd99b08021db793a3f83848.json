The president has also recently grilled certain Fox employees, including his confidant Sean Hannity, on this topic, one of these sources noted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been good to them,\u201d Trump said in these last few weeks, according to another one of the three sources. The president, a remarkably avid consumer of cable news, sounded surprised and frustrated that he was seeing too many people to his liking on the network treating him \u201cunfairly\u201d on their shows.\n\nThe president has long demanded unflinching loyalty from Fox News and Fox Business talent and brass, and hasn\u2019t been shy about making his disappointments public.\n\n\u201c.@FoxNews is at it again. So different from what they used to be during the 2016 Primaries, & before - Proud Warriors! Now new Fox Polls, which have always been terrible to me (they had me losing BIG to Crooked Hillary), have me down to Sleepy Joe,\u201d Trump posted to Twitter on Friday, adding to his running list of tweeted grievances against Fox News this year.\n\nBeyond his rage-tweeting, the president has in recent months reminded his senior aides, including his top economic adviser (and former CNBC star) Larry Kudlow, to branch out and make sure to keep doing more and more shows that aren\u2019t on Fox News, according to two people with knowledge of Trump\u2019s request.\n\nThe president has also told multiple associates that he sees Fox mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2019s sons as \u201cvery liberal\u201d and has quizzed former and current Fox personalities about what they think of them and if the Murdoch kids can be trusted. (Rupert Murdoch also doubles as a prominent informal adviser to Trump, often taking calls from the 45th president.)\n\nThe president\u2019s obsession with monitoring Fox\u2019s fealty and devotion to him might seem strange, or at least unnecessary to the casual observer. Fox News and sister channel Fox Business Network are bastions of pro-Trump propaganda, with primetime lineups crammed with vehement defenders of the president and MAGA diehards. Some of Fox\u2019s marquee names\u2014Hannity, Murdoch, Pete Hegseth, Lou Dobbs, Jeanine Pirro, to name a few\u2014regularly advise Trump on messaging and even policy, and the network has served as a pipeline of sorts for filling open jobs at the upper echelons of his administration.\n\nEven before the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump had kept close track of who at Fox was and was not subservient.\n\nSam Nunberg, who worked as a Trump political adviser at the start of the 2016 run, recounted to The Daily Beast how Trump would often use the same five-word phrase when addressing a Fox host he felt had crossed him: \u201cI\u2019m very surprised by you.\u201d Nunberg recalled one instance when he was with the then-future president in his Trump Tower office in May 2015, a month before the campaign launch, while Trump was doing a phone interview with Fox\u2019s Neil Cavuto.\n\nBy the end of their conversation, Trump believed Cavuto wasn\u2019t taking him or his presidential ambitions seriously and devoted too much airtime asking him about his finances. After Trump hung up, he looked up at the aides in his office and said, \u201cWhat the hell was that? We\u2019re not doing him again,\u201d according to Nunberg. (Trump, of course, would end up appearing with Cavuto again.)\n\nBut for all the drama and fuss, the dirty little secret is that a lot of people working at Fox News\u2014on- and off-camera\u2014aren\u2019t worried about Trump\u2019s hurt feelings and his latest mean tweets. In fact, some are pleased.\n\nMany Fox News employees, from rank-and-file to higher-level staff, have been largely unbothered by President Trump\u2019s public criticisms of the network, which are primarily directed at the organization\u2019s \u201cnews side.\u201d\n\nNetwork insiders told The Daily Beast that president\u2019s complaints have made little impact given the overwhelmingly positive coverage Trump has received across many Fox primetime shows throughout his presidency. Trump\u2019s Fox News tweets have only generated buzz in the building when he\u2019s targeted specific news personalities, including Leland Vittert and Shep Smith.\n\n\u201cI think the reaction is more of an eyeroll than anything,\u201d one Fox News staffer told The Daily Beast.\n\nFurther, some in the building feel that the Trump attacks are actually useful, as they can be used as rebuttals against critics calling them out for being \u201cstate media\u201d in the Trump era. In addition to the network\u2019s more favorable coverage of the administration, Fox News has faced criticism over the cozy relationship between many of its stars and the president, as well as the revolving door between the network and the administration.\n\n\u201cEverybody wins,\u201d said a Fox staffer on the opinion side.", "description": "The president has taken to prodding his friends at the network about Fox\u2019s news anchors treating him \u201cunfairly\u201d and whether the Murdoch sons can be trusted, sources said.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "Maxwell Tani", "White House Reporter", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1564507286/190730-swin-tani-trump-lashing-out-at-fox-hero_nhvm84", "published_at": "2019-07-30"}
