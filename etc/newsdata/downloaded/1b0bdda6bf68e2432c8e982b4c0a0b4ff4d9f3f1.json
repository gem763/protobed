Right: Portrait Matthu Placek\n\nBe prepared for sensory overload when you step inside Jacolby Satterwhite\u2019s new show at Brooklyn's Pioneer Works. Centering around his multi-part, digitally animated series Birds in Paradise, You\u2019re At Home is an immersive experience that includes video projections, virtual reality and sculpture. It even includes a retail store that sells records by PAT, his collaborative music project with Nick Weiss (of Teengirl Fantasy) which utilizes recordings by Satterwhite\u2019s mother Patricia.\n\n\n\nBuilt over many years, You\u2019re At Home is Satterwhite\u2019s first solo show at a major institution in New York, and it almost feels like a retrospective, as it encompasses so much of his past work, while also setting the stage for what\u2019s to come. Walk through the cavernous space and you\u2019ll see screens featuring naked and leather-clad bodies voguing, gyrating, and miming sexual acts in tangled industrial settings. Fantastical creatures fly through the sky to PAT\u2019s ambient, discordant dance music and Satterwhite\u2019s mother\u2019s innocent, disembodied voice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dystopian reflection, a utopian reflection, a neutral reflection,\u201d says the 33-year-old artist. Satterwhite has become a significant artist over the duration of his short but impactful career, often being grouped under 'queer art,' which may be partly why You\u2019re At Home is being hailed as presenting a kind of queer utopia. But Satterwhite says it\u2019s more complicated than that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ultimately a reflection of where I am right now. It\u2019s almost like a meditation of me trying to massage out the toxic curiosities and the positive curiosities. It\u2019s just me thriving, living and breathing. It\u2019s some good moments and some bad moments, but it\u2019s just me vulnerably resolving myself in public.\u201d\n\nIncorporating not only his mother\u2019s recordings but also her countless drawings of home goods that she envisioned as her dream product line, You\u2019re At Home feels like a reconciliation with the past \u2013 both for Satterwhite and his mother, who passed away in 2016 after suffering from schizophrenia.\n\nIt\u2019s a theme that\u2019s shared with another monumental project Satterwhite recently worked on \u2013 When I Get Home, by Solange (he created a video for the album\u2019s song \u201cSound of Rain\u201d). Though the similarities in their titles was a coincidence, the sense of personal reckoning was very much intentional.\n\n\u201cI always talked about this period being the end of my Saturn return, and the journey of building this body of work has been very vulnerable. It forced me to reconcile so many things. And so I feel like, at the end of producing this body of work, I got a ton of my agency back. I have a clearer vision and I\u2019m a lot more fearless and liberated.\u201d\n\nSatterwhite is intent on creating new artistic forms, and he achieves this with You\u2019re At Home by creating what he calls a \u201csensational hybridity of concepts.\u201d He is referring to not just his multimedia practices, but also his vulnerable state of \u201cbeing queer and black in the United States of America,\u201d and his mother\u2019s mental illness. \u201cWhen you mix the public and the private, it does create quite a vulnerable conflict that probably yields the most interesting things an artist can do,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just pulling from a constant vulnerability and fear and uncertainty in order to generate new forms.\u201d\n\nSatterwhite himself appears countless times throughout You\u2019re At Home, dancing among the \u201c50 or 60\u201d other performers he solicited. Utilizing his own naked body repeatedly in the work wasn\u2019t just a way to etch the personal into the political; it was also convenient. \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste anyone else\u2019s time asking them to do banal, irregular movements for eight hours a day and do outfit changes on the green screen,\u201d he says of the laborious process. \u201cIt [my body] was a resource that I had that I could master and have fun with for myself.\u201d\n\nHe likens this process to pioneering artist Bruce Nauman, who also \u201cused his body as a framework.\u201d Satterwhite says, \u201cSince I\u2019m more of a postmodernist human being in the Instagram era, where data mining is the new oil currency, I believe that certain kinds of symbolic things that are my identity are things that I should use serially in the work, to make something that is much more compelling than what we should get out of data mining,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI have access to my body all day, so it\u2019s a medium, it\u2019s a conduit for the message, you know? It\u2019s not necessarily personal.\u201d\n\nThe difference for Satterwhite, however, is that his very existence as a gay black man is politicized. \u201cBy nature, my body is going to yield the politic, and that\u2019s why I had to take a long break from painting\u2026 So, knowing that my body is a political agent, using it is a natural expression. That\u2019s why in some parts of the film I have myself lynched and shrouded. I\u2019m doing a Nigerian Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 G\u1eb9l\u1eb9d\u1eb9 masquerade ritual, but when viewers look at it, their take is [informed by] United States history and they think I\u2019m performing some kind of Jim Crow thing, some kind of tragedy. But really I\u2019m re-performing a ritual of renewal. I like to conflate how much my body has problematic agencies that can really deform what you see based on how I neutralize what the gesture is.\u201d\n\nAnother question the work raises is of the commodification and consumption of queer culture, as there is so much queer iconography situated around a retail environment. He says, \u201cThe burden of capitalism is the underlying subtext of the whole project, considering that it drove my mother crazy \u2013 drawing inventions as an outlet for the fantasy capitalist empire that she wanted to live in. She was taught that that desire was a spectrum for happiness, while watching the media for her whole life, and teaching her children that.\u201d\n\nSatterwhite says the \u201cthousands\u201d of drawings of home goods that his mother left behind naturally lent themselves to the retail store he created for the exhibition. For her, these home goods were a source of happiness, while Satterwhite says he found joy in \u201cwatching black female pop stars\u201d as he grew up in South Carolina.\n\n\u201cI think that gay men identify with those forces as an escape. Like, when you see someone trying to be larger than life, who represents an adversary you can identify with, they usually become something that you look at over and over again, while you\u2019re trying to escape places that aren\u2019t necessarily safe spaces for you to build, thrive and grow. So maybe, considering my mother\u2019s obsession with pop songs, it felt like a natural progression,\u201d he says, of turning himself into a quasi pop star figure with PAT.\n\nIn this way, You\u2019re At Home isn\u2019t just the bona fide realization of Satterwhite\u2019s multifaceted vision, but his mother\u2019s, too. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaboration,\u201d he says, simultaneously signaling the end of a period of grief and the beginning of a period of renewal.\n\n---\n\nYou\u2019re At Home is on view at Pioneer Works now through November 24. Satterwhite also has a show at the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, called Room for Living, on view through January 19, 2020.", "description": "i-D talks to the artist about 'You\u2019re At Home,' which encompasses virtual reality, video projections, sculpture, and music, in a triumphant personal reckoning.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da72204df4e600009d59dd8/lede/1571236759220-pjimage-37.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
