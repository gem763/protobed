And they didn't want them. They said, 'we don't want them'.\n\n'They came from France, they came from Germany, they came from the UK. They came from a lot of countries.\n\n'And I actually said to them, if you don't take them, I'm going to drop them right on your border. And you can have fun capturing them again.'\n\nHe went on: 'The United States taxpayer is not going to pay for the next 50 years. You see what Guantanamo costs.\n\n'We're not going to pay tens of billions of dollars because we were good enough to capture people that want to go back to Germany, France, UK, and other parts of Europe.\n\n'And they can walk back. They can't walk to our country. We have lots of water in between our country and them.'\n\nThe President also defended his own controversial travel ban on a series of Muslim-majority countries and called it 'very effective'.\n\nThe fate of captured ISIS fighters has been highly controversial in Europe since the terror group's supposed 'caliphate' crumbled to nothing earlier this year.\n\nDetention camps in Syria are believed to be holding more than 10,000 militants, including some 2,000 foreign fighters.\n\nIn addition, tens of thousands of ISIS-linked women and children are held at the al-Hol camp in north-eastern Syria.\n\nFears of a breakout have been on the rise since Turkey's invasion of northern Syria caused chaos in the region.\n\nSome ISIS supporters themselves have pleaded with their former home countries to let them stand trial at home.\n\nIn the most high-profile case in Britain, teenage ISIS bride Shamima Begum begged to come back to the UK after she gave birth in a prison camp.\n\nBut the UK government refused to let her return, and then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped her of her British citizenship.\n\nSecurity experts have warned it may be difficult to prove criminal charges against hundreds of fighters, meaning dozens or even hundreds of ISIS supporters would walk free in Europe.\n\nThe al-Hol camp (pictured earlier this year) houses tens of thousands of displaced people including relatives of ISIS fighters and security fears have been on the rise\n\n'German citizens have the right to return, but we have little ability in Syria at present to check whether German citizens are actually affected,' Berlin's foreign minister Heiko Maas said earlier this year.\n\nMaas said authorities would have to 'check to what extent they were involved in fighting for IS, which would result in criminal proceedings having to be opened against them.'\n\n'These people can come to Germany only if it is ensured that they can immediately be taken into custody,' he said.\n\nLast month the European Union set up a common counter-terrorism register in the hope of making convictions easier.\n\nThe new tool could also help prevent new attacks in Europe, as prosecutors will have access to more information on suspects, officials hope.\n\nFrench jihadists made up the largest contingent of European ISIS recruits, it is believed.\n\nAn ISIS cell of French and Belgian fighters previously crossed from Syria into Turkey and launched deadly attacks on Paris and Brussels in 2015 and 2016.\n\nTrump made his comments yesterday after announcing the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a U.S. special forces raid in Syria.\n\nThe Americans spent two hours in the compound and 'took highly sensitive material and information from the raid, much having to do with ISIS origins, future plans, things that we very much want,' Trump announced.\n\nU.S. intelligence workers will now begin searching the trove of information for evidence of planned attacks around the world.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. troops took DNA samples which were matched to an Iraqi prison where Baghdadi had been held in 2004, confirming his identity.", "description": "Demanding that Britain, France and Germany deal with their ISIS fighters at home, Trump warned the U.S. would not pay for hundreds of jihadists to be held at Guantanamo Bay 'for the next 50 years'.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/10/20274394-0-image-a-5_1572258297846.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
