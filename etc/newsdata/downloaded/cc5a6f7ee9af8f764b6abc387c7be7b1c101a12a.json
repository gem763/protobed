I was there to write the rules for whistleblowers and to protect them. Intelligence depends on whistleblowers being protected,\u201d Pelosi continued, citing one of the party\u2019s agreed-upon repetitive keywords and phrases intended to push impeachment \u2013 \u201cnational security.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the president doing what he\u2019s doing is undermining our national security as well as endangering people who speak truth to power,\u201d Pelosi declared.\n\nHer remarks follow the president calling the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d a \u201cfake\u201d and his second-hand description of the Ukraine call a \u201cfraud\u201d:\n\nThe Fake Whistleblower complaint is not holding up. It is mostly about the call to the Ukrainian President which, in the name of transparency, I immediately released to Congress & the public. The Whistleblower knew almost nothing, its 2ND HAND description of the call is a fraud! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nJake Tapper on Thursday reported that the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d is a \u201cregistered Democrat,\u201d lending credence to critics who say the impeachment inquiry is based entirely on partisan politics.\n\n\u201cFirst from CNN, a source familiar with the whistleblower investigation tells me that the political bias referred to by the Intelligence Community Inspector General is that the whistleblower is a registered Democrat. That is the bias,\u201d Tapper said.\n\n\u201cThe IG acknowledged the bias in his statement that said didn\u2019t change the facts of the whistleblower complaint. The attorney for the whistleblower declined to give us a comment,\u201d he added\n\nThe revelation followed a day of political fallout for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), who knew of the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint days before it was officially filed. According to reports, the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d took the complaint to a House Intelligence Committee aide, who relayed the information to Schiff.\n\nHowever, Schiff proclaimed in a September 17 interview on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe that \u201cwe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower\u201d:\n\n\ud83d\udea8 FLASHBACK \ud83d\udea8 Schiff claimed: \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the Whistleblower\u201d pic.twitter.com/czqCvE3hSF \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 2, 2019\n\nA committee spokeperson told the Washington Post that Schiff \u201cacknowledges that his statement should have been more carefully phrased.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegarding Chairman Schiff\u2019s comments on Morning Joe, in the context, he intended to answer the question of whether the Committee had heard testimony from the whistleblower, which they had not,\u201d a spokesperson said:\n\nAs he said in his answer, the whistleblower was then awaiting instructions from the Acting DNI as to how the whistleblower could contact the Committee. Nonetheless he acknowledges that his statement should have been more carefully phrased to make that distinction clear.\n\nThe Post\u2019s Fact Checker ultimately gave Schiff Four Pinocchios.", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said on Thursday that she is \"very worried\" about the security of the so-called \"whistleblower.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/pelosi-downcast-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
