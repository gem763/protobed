Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nSuccession showrunner Jesse Armstrong scored a big win during the 2019 Emmys, but at-home viewers weren\u2019t able to hear every word of his acceptance speech. When Armstrong accepted the award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series, he began by saying, \u201cQuite a lot of British winners. Maybe too many. Maybe you should have a think about those immigration restrictions,\u201d and then made a crack about immigration policy in the United States that was bleeped out of the broadcast. But no, he wasn\u2019t censored for mentioning immigration on a Fox outlet. (Fellow winner Alex Borstein also talked about her immigrant family members earlier in the night.) Armstrong was bleeped because, according to reports from the room, he made reference to the \u201cshithole countries\u201d that Donald Trump derided last year. Nothing too coarse for regular Succession viewers to hear, but apparently too much for broadcast TV.", "description": "Succession writer Jesse Armstrong won the 2019 Emmy for best writing for a drama series, but then got bleeped during the broadcast when he mentioned immigration and \u201cshithole countries.\u201d", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/22/22-jesse-armstrong.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
