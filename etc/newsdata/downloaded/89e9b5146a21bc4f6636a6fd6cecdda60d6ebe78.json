I've seen this many, many times. And I know where you're going with it. I've seen it with Raheem Sterling, I've seen it with Lewis Hamilton. I can't win, whatever I do.'\n\nEarlier this month Salazar was handed a four-year ban by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency for, among other violations, possessing and trafficking testosterone while training top runners at the Nike Oregon Project. Along with Salazar, endocrinologist Jeffrey Brown also received a ban, but Farah insisted he was never seen by the doctor.", "description": "Mo Farah distanced himself from his former trainer Alberto Salazar and accused the media of having an agenda against him", "authors": ["Source"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2945ecd4ea836b350e3b6c5176d92f1bf504ad51/0_831_2504_1502/master/2504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4faabe22dc87c9ad0f1584803730782e", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
