On Monday, Lakers forward LeBron James spoke publicly about the incident for the first time, and didn\u2019t mince words while calling Morey out for a tweet that he says could have caused people to be physically \u201charmed.\u201d\n\nWatch:\n\nLeBron says he believes Rockets GM Daryl Morey wasn\u2019t educated when he spoke about Hong Kong and that his tweet could have hurt a lot of people, including financially pic.twitter.com/UMj71DPQH7 \u2014 Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) October 15, 2019\n\nThe NBA received tremendous bipartisan criticism for their initial response to Morey\u2019s tweet, when they responded by calling the post \u201cregrettable\u201d for the offense that it caused. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver eventually tried to quell the backlash by championing Morey\u2019s free speech rights.\n\nNow, with the league representatives and players back from their tumultuous trip to China, it seemed like the news cycle of the NBA-China rift had died down. However, with James denouncing free speech in even stronger terms than the NBA did while calling a pro-democracy tweet \u201cuneducated,\u201d it\u2019s difficult to see the crisis going away.\n\nIt\u2019s also difficult to see why James would so willingly and unnecessarily reignite the controversy.\n\nThen again, perhaps it makes sense after all. James is still the best and most popular player in the league. Moreover, for nearly ten years he\u2019s championed numerous social justice causes and launched numerous attacks against President Trump, all to the delight of the sports media.\n\nMaybe he\u2019s become so used to being applauded for speaking his mind, that he no longer recognizes when he shouldn\u2019t?\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "LeBron James called Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey uneducated and went off at-length about the \"negative\" side-effects of free speech", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/gty-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
