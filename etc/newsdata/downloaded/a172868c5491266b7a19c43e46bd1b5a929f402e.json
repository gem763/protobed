Hillary is still the smartest of the bunch. She\u2019s also better known than any of the candidates, so she doesn\u2019t need a lot of money,\u201d Brown argued.\n\n\u201cClinton is the only candidate short of Barack Obama who has the brains, the battle-tested brawn and the national presence to take out Trump. And Obama can\u2019t run.\u201d he said.\n\nBrown\u2019s latest vote of no confidence in the current Democratic field echoes his earlier pronouncements. In February, he had already declared that none of the candidates \u2014 including his former girlfriend, Kamala Harris \u2014 could beat Trump.\n\nThe Democratic candidates \u201call have impressive credentials, winning personalities and positive messages, but none displays the \u201cpeople personality\u201d that our media-savvy president has mastered,\u201d Brown wrote at the time.\n\nThe most recent Public Policy Institute of California poll showed Harris in a distant fourth among likely Democratic primary voters in her home state, while former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) were locked in a dead heat for first place.\n\n\u201cHowever, among voters with a candidate preference, more than half (53%) would consider supporting another candidate,\u201d the PPIC poll added.\n\nJoel B.
