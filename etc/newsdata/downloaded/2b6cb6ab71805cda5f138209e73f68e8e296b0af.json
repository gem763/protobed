The company designs and manufactures connectivity and sensor products for harsh environments in a variety of industries.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of TEL, below, we can see that an upside rally could be shaping up. TEL has been trading sideways the past seven months but things have started to improve this month.\n\nPrices are above the rising 50-day moving average line and the rising 200-day line. Earlier this month TEL successfully tested the 200-day line.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has moved lower since late April signaling more aggressive selling but prices stayed in a sideways range despite that. This month the OBV line turned upwards and this could be the start of a reversal.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator moved up to the zero line recently for a new outright go long signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of TEL, below, we can see a picture that is turning more positive. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has bottomed the past three months and could soon break its downward drift.\n\nThe MACD oscillator has been above the zero line since April and looks like it can soon cross to the upside for a fresh go long signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of TEL, below, the software is projecting a possible downside price target in the $75 area. A trade at $97.41 will be an upside breakout and open the way for an upside price target.\n\nBottom line strategy: After looking over the charts of TEL, above, traders could go long TEL at current levels risking a close below $89. Add to longs above $97.50.", "description": "Let's check out the charts of TEL....TEL", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Te Connectivity Could Soon Connect With Higher Prices", "Let'S Check Out The Charts Of Tel.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "Tom Graff", "Bob Lang", "Carolyn Boroden", "Doug Kass", "Jim"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/d4685929-bb7b-11e8-b0bf-a90c4baa4f8d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
