Increasing evidence supports the presence of immune dysfunction and inflammation in the brains of children with ASD,' the authors wrote.\n\n'These findings highlight the important role...of IL-37 in the inhibition of inflammation, thus supporting the development of IL37 as a treatment for ASD.'", "description": "A new study led by Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, Massachusetts, has found high numbers of an inflammatory protein in the brains of children with autism spectrum disorder.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/19/18033982-0-image-a-2_1570473085676.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
