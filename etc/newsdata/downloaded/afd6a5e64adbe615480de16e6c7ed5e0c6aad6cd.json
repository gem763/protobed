Wade, the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 ruling that established the right to an abortion.\n\n\"I think this is a really unique moment for us as an organization,\" said Kelley Robinson, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes. \"The stakes are higher than ever, and we're coming out more powerful than ever with our largest investment ever made.\"\n\nThe financial commitment is a substantial increase from the $30 million Planned Parenthood committed to spending in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut the past year has raised questions about whether Planned Parenthood can enter 2020 with the same firepower it brought to the 2018 midterms, when it helped elect what Democrats describe as the first ever \"pro-choice\" majority in the House.\n\nWhy it matters: Planned Parenthood is a reliable mobilizer for Democrats. It plans to reach 5 million voters by Election Day and doesn't expect this year's trouble to stop them.\n\nRead more on the group's challenges \u2013 and plans \u2013 here.\n\nRelated: The organization also endorsed its first slate of 2020 candidates.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund unveiled nearly 90 endorsements in mostly battleground states, saying it is underscoring \"red-to-pink\" races where they think Democratic candidates can flip the seat, as well as \"frontline\" candidates who support abortion access and are vulnerable in the 2020 races.\n\nThe endorsees include Senate hopeful Mark Kelly, a Democrat running to unseat Sen.

Kentucky was the first state to win federal approval for work requirements, but a federal judge has twice struck them down. The same judge also blocked the Arkansas requirements from taking effect.\n\nThe cases are the first to reach an appeals court, and the verdicts could have far-reaching consequences. The Trump administration has made it a priority to approve work requirements, even in states that have not expanded Medicaid. Nine conservative states have been granted approval to date, and others are waiting.\n\nAccording to GAO, Kentucky's work requirements are estimated to cost $270 million to implement, while Arkansas would cost an estimated $26 million to implement.\n\nCDC confirms 26 deaths from vaping-related lung illness\n\nTwenty-six people have died from the vaping-related illnesses that are sweeping the country, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced Thursday.\n\nThe deaths were confirmed in 21 states, including three in California, two in Georgia and two in Kansas.\n\nIn all, 1,299 confirmed or probable lung injury cases related to vaping have been reported to the CDC so far, an increase of 219 cases from figures released last week.\n\nOf the 573 patients who provided information about what products they had used, 76 percent reported vaping THC, with or without nicotine-containing products.\n\nRead more here.\n\nWhat we're reading:\n\nDrug industry hired dozens of officials from the DEA as the agency tried to curb opioid abuse (The Washington Post)\n\n'We vape, we vote': How vaping crackdowns are politicizing vapers (Kaiser Health News)\n\nHealth officials urge caution in reducing opioids for pain patients (The New York Times)\n\nAmid vaping crisis, U.S. to issue new advice for doctors focused on lung infections (Reuters)\n\nState by state\n\nObamaCare in Arizona: More choice and stability expected for 2020 (Arizona Republic)\n\nParkland and Santa Fe schools disclose devastating after-effects of shootings (Politico)\n\nPennsylvania says changes to Medicaid will yield $85 million in savings (The Philadelphia Inquirer)", "description": "Welcome to Thursday's Overnight Health Care.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/plannedparenthoodprotestdc_030217getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
