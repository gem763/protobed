Model S electric automobile, equipped with Autopilot hardware and software, hands-free on a highway.\n\nTesla is acquiring DeepScale, a computer vision start-up that could help it develop fully driverless vehicles, CNBC has learned.\n\nThe deal could help Tesla's goal to deliver cars with advanced driver-assistance systems that are good enough for owners to rent them out as \"robotaxis\" on an Uber-like platform without drivers. However, like all automakers, Tesla is limited by the computational resources it can build into its vehicles.\n\nDeepScale's technology was designed to help automakers use low-wattage processors, which are standard in most cars, to power very accurate computer vision. These processors work with sensors, mapping, planning and control systems, to allow cars to make sense of what's going on around them.\n\nThis week, DeepScale CEO Forrest Iandola joined Tesla as a senior staff machine learning scientist, according to an announcement he posted on his LinkedIn page.\n\nIandola simply said, \"I joined the Tesla #Autopilot team this week. I am looking forward to working with some of the brightest minds in #deeplearning and #autonomousdriving.\" Iandola obtained a PhD in electrical engineering and computer science at UC Berkeley, where he worked on deep neural nets that could work on mobile devices with relatively small amounts of memory.\n\nTwo other people familiar with the deal confirmed that Tesla had bought the company outright, but declined to disclose the precise terms of the deal.", "description": "DeepScale's technology helps automakers use low-wattage processors, which are standard in most cars, to power very accurate computer vision.
