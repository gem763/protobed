The couple are having another wedding in South Carolina, nearly a year after they first tied the knot at a New York City courthouse.\n\nWhere are they hosting this larger, more lavish affair? According to People, it\u2019s taking place at Palmetto Bluff.\n\nSpecifically, the party will be held at Montage Palmetto Bluff hotel. Perched upon the May River in the Carolina lowcountry, the five-star property is filled with palm trees, oaks dripping with Spanish moss, and rolling green lawns. The amenities are top notch: guests can choose between rooms at a cozy inn, and secluded cottages nestled throughout grounds, which are expansive\u2014there\u2019s a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course, a marina with a boat dock, and a nature preserve.\n\nThe entire resort encompasses southern charm. Take the abundance of wraparound porches and verandas, as well as the scrumptious Carolina cuisine: the signature restaurant, Octagon, serves up elevated cuisine like she-crab soup, fried May River oysters, as well as shrimp and grits. The more casual Cole\u2019s, a scenic spot set upon a marsh, offers some seriously hearty barbecue\u2014pulled pork and ribs, anyone?\n\nAnd there\u2019s good news for couples, perhaps including Hailey and Justin themselves: Montage Palmetto Bluff has churches on the premises. They could wed in the white-clapboard, green-shuttered May River Chapel, which, as the name implies, overlooks an idyllic, meandering waterway. Then there is the slightly larger Somerset Chapel, with its grand arched windows.\n\nMultiple reports imply that the Biebers have rented out the entire place, which means that they can secure the ultimate reception space: the grand main lawn, which sprawls out in front of the historic inn, or the Cottage Lawn that peacefully borders the marshland and the river. Whatever they choose, it sounds like it will be an event to remember.\n\nOriginally Appeared on Vogue\n\n", "description": "Justin and Hailey Bieber chose a historic property in Palmetto Bluff, a scenic community on the South Carolina coast.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5JAkvH4iBNTiH8XW3NMxXA--~B/aD0yMjUwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/vogue_137/15f5ae5e9640a73cada02ce2a9361c97", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
