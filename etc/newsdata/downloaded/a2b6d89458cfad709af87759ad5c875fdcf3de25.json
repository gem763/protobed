DePaolo, the president and chief executive of Signature. \u201cIt\u2019s not the banks.\u201d\n\nNew York Commercial Bank said in a statement that it began issuing medallion loans before the housing crisis and that they were a very small part of its business. The bank did not engage in risky lending practices, a spokesman said.\n\nMr. Messados said in an interview that he disagreed with interest-only loans and other one-sided terms. But he said he was caught between banks developing the loans and drivers clamoring for them. \u201cThey were insisting on this,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are you supposed to do? Say, \u2018I\u2019m not doing the sale?\u2019\u201d\n\nSeveral lenders challenged the idea that borrowers were unsophisticated. They said that some got better deals by negotiating with multiple lenders at once.\n\nMr. Greenbaum, Mr. Chipman and Mr. Sapino declined to comment, as did Capital One.\n\nSome fleet owners worked to manipulate prices. In the most prominent example, Evgeny Freidman, a brash Russian immigrant who owned so many medallions that some called him \u201cThe Taxi King,\u201d said he purposefully overpaid for medallions sold at city auctions. He reasoned that the higher prices would become the industry standard, making the medallions he already owned worth more. Mr. Freidman, who was partners with Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former lawyer, disclosed the plan in a 2012 speech at Yeshiva University. He recently pleaded guilty to felony tax fraud. He declined to comment.\n\nAs medallion prices kept increasing, the industry became strained. Drivers had to work longer hours to make monthly payments. Eventually, loan records show, many drivers had to use almost all their income on payments.\n\n\u201cThe prices got to be ridiculous,\u201d said Vincent Sapone, the retired manager of the League of Mutual Taxi Owners, an owner association. \u201cWhen it got close to $1 million, nobody was going to pay that amount of money, unless they came from another country. Nobody from Brooklyn was going to pay that.\u201d", "description": "Thousands of immigrants who were chasing the dream of owning a New York taxi were trapped in reckless loans by bankers who made huge profits, The Times found.", "authors": ["Brian M.
