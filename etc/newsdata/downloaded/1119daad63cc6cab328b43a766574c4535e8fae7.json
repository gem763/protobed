But when does she have fun?\n\nName: Jennifer Aniston.\n\nAge: 50.\n\nAppearance: Almost the same.\n\nAlmost the same as what? Almost the same as how she looked 20 years ago, when she was starring in the hit series Friends, according to the Mail Online.\n\nAmazing. What is the secret of her youthful appearance? Not eating.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound ideal at all. Well, more specifically, she\u2019s adopted an \u201cintermittent fasting\u201d regime, more commonly known as the 16:8 diet.\n\nIs it like the 5:2 diet, except you starve for 16 days and then binge for 8 days? No, in this case the numbers represent hours. \u201cI noticed a big difference in going without solid food for 16 hours,\u201d Aniston told the Radio Times.\n\nSixteen hours without food? By the time you\u2019re allowed to eat, it would be past your bedtime! Fortunately, your sleeping hours are counted as part of the fasting period. You just have to delay breakfast until 10am.\n\nI could probably just stay in bed until then, as long as I were allowed to eat what I liked afterwards. You eat anything, but you must stop by 5 or 6pm, when the fasting begins anew.\n\nAnd does it actually keep you young? Who knows. Some people believe it is supposed to keep you slim, improve blood sugar control, boost brain function and increase life expectancy.\n\nYou know what\u2019s guaranteed to make you feel old? Eating dinner at 5pm. Most intermittent fasters prefer the more convenient 12 to 8 eating window, but 10 to 6 is considered optimal.\n\nOptimally joyless, do you mean? Obviously Aniston isn\u2019t completely rigid about the whole thing. She has a \u201ccheat\u201d day once a week where she treats herself outside fasting hours.\n\nAnd what does she have? Celery juice.\n\nShe treats herself to a celery juice? What an example to us all. Indeed she is.\n\nI was being sarcastic. She is certainly an example to Reese Witherspoon, her co-star in the new series The Morning Show. \u201cJen knows so much about health and fitness that I always defer to her,\u201d she told the Radio Times. \u201cShe\u2019s great at wellbeing advice.\u201d\n\nIs there more to her wellbeing regime? In addition to fasting, Jen does meditation, followed by five workouts per week. Witherspoon, the swot, manages six.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how these people find time in their schedule to get drunk. They don\u2019t need to get drunk; they get high on being a better person than you.\n\nDo say: \u201cFasting, meditation, exercise: what a great way to use up the hours between now and death.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cFocus, Jen. It\u2019s nearly 6pm, and this box of doughnuts isn\u2019t going to eat itself.\u201d", "description": "The star\u2019s wellbeing secrets include fasting, meditation and five workouts a week.
