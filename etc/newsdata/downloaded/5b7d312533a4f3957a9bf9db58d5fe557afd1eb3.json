Ulta managed solid sales growth and steady profitability. However, management noted that the core makeup category that comprises over half of its sales isn't rebounding as executives had hoped it would. As a result, Ulta reduced its outlook on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nNow what\n\nCEO Mary Dillon and her team expressed confidence that the makeup niche will recover, but likely not until 2020 at the earliest. Without healthy growth in this segment, it will be hard for Ulta Beauty to return to its prior pace of comparable-store sales gains of around 8% to 10% and increasing operating margin. Thus, investors have scaled back their expectations for the salon and beauty products retailer.\n\nMore From The Motley Fool\n\nDemitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.
