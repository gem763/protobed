Shape Created with Sketch. 18 of the greatest gigs ever \u2013 according to our critics 1/18 David Bowie, Rainbow Theatre, 1972 The long gone Rainbow in London\u2019s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. \u201cThey haven\u2019t even finished building the stage,\u201d I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with David/Ziggy walking out to the drums of \u201cFive Years\u201d and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven\u2019s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act \u2013 a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister) Getty 2/18 Dolly Parton, Dominion Theatre, 1983 Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London\u2019s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of \u201cDo I Ever Cross Your Mind?\u201d and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqu\u00e9 jokes and blue banter. There\u2019s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton) Rex 3/18 Live Aid, Dominion Theatre, 1985 You don\u2019t usually realise you\u2019re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing \u201cRockin\u2019 All Over The World\u201d. There were numerous stand-out moments; perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of \u201cLet It Be\u201d, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d and \u201cRadio Ga Ga\u201d to \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d and \u201cWe Are The Champions\u201d. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister) 4/18 BB King, Hammersmith Odeon, 1985 Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London\u2019s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of \u201cThe Thrill is Gone\u201d. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell's Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King's face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton) AP 5/18 Rollercoaster Tour, Brixton Academy, 1992 When The Jesus & Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey\u2019s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that\u2019s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like \u201cColin Zeal\u201d while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single \u201cPopscene\u201d, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I'd seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn\u2019t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont) Getty 6/18 PIxies, Brixton Academy, 2004 When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs \u2013 and music just doesn\u2019t get better than that \u2013 it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. \u201cTame\u201d sent me feral, \u201cGigantic\u201d was titanic, \u201cBone Machine\u201d crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through \u201cGouge Away\u201d, \u201cMonkey Gone To Heaven\u201d and \u201cDebaser\u201d, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was; Kim Deal\u2019s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago\u2019s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan\u2019s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order. (Mark Beaumont) EPA 7/18 Foals, Buffalo Bar, 2007 North London\u2019s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees \u2013 or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious; it\u2019s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you\u2019ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: \"The French Open\", \"Balloons\", \"Hummer\u201d, \u201cMathletics\u201d, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent \"new wave\" vocals. I\u2019d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read \"Math is for Everyone\"), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we\u2019d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray) Rex 8/18 Crystal Castles, Camden Crawl, 2008 Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass\u2019s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe; singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as \u201cCourtship Dating\u201d. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of \u201crock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u201d \u2013 or whatever the hell it is \u2013 most of the time, they\u2019re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There\u2019s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey) PA 9/18 Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008 It used to be that rock\u2019n\u2019roll was a young person\u2019s game; anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer\u2019s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I\u2019ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was \u2013 and indeed remains \u2013 untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges) Rex 10/18 Leonard Cohen, Benicassim Festival, 2013 Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It's sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as \"Dance Me to the End of Love\" and \"So Long, Marianne\" \u2013 are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of \"Hallelujah\". The song's been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it's surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith) Getty 11/18 Bobby Womack, Latitude, 2013 The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we\u2019ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. \u201cAll soul singers come from gospel,\u201d he told them. Womack\u2019s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn\u2019t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special. (Chris Harvey) PA 12/18 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014 Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival \u2013 a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier \u2013 her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard) Getty 13/18 Kate Bush, Hammersmith Apollo, 2014 After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I've ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a \"greatest hits\" section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of \"The Ninth Wave\". Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of \"Aerial\", \"The Sky of Honey\", was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I've ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones) Rex 14/18 Patti Smith, Field Day, 2015 Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the dark glasses,\u201d Smith said by way of introduction. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be cool, it\u2019s just, you know\u2026 the sun.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the f***ing coolest!\u201d a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled; tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn\u2019t matter if she messed up, as she did on \u201cBreak it Up\u201d, because she offered the instantly immortal words: \u201cI don\u2019t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.\u201d You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O\u2019Connor) Getty Images 15/18 D'Angelo, Hammersmith Apollo, 2015 When D\u2019Angelo released his surprise third record \u2013 the politically fraught Black Messiah \u2013 it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000\u2019s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to \u201cSugah Daddy\u201d, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who's live shows to join in the fun. At one point D\u2019Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D\u2019Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a divine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled \"The Second Coming\". (Roisin O\u2019Connor) Corbis 16/18 Lorde, Brighton Centre, 2017 A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde\u2019s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance \u2013 the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she'd chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance \u2013 and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard) Getty Images 17/18 David Byrne, Brighton Centre, 2018 When you\u2019ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations \u2013 some mind-blowing, others not \u2013 on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne\u2019s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance \u2013 no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones \u2013 and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges) EPA 18/18 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018 Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier \u2013 known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the \"Chris\" for her second album \u2013 tweeted: \u201cI think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!\u201d She delivered on that promise \u2013 falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet \u2013 as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: \u201cVive everyone!\u201d We left thrilled and elated.

The song's been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it's surely never felt as moving.

Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. \u201cAll soul singers come from gospel,\u201d he told them. Womack\u2019s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn\u2019t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.

But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival \u2013 a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier \u2013 her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard) Getty 13/18 Kate Bush, Hammersmith Apollo, 2014 After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I've ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a \"greatest hits\" section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of \"The Ninth Wave\". Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of \"Aerial\", \"The Sky of Honey\", was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I've ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones) Rex 14/18 Patti Smith, Field Day, 2015 Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the dark glasses,\u201d Smith said by way of introduction. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be cool, it\u2019s just, you know\u2026 the sun.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the f***ing coolest!\u201d a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled; tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn\u2019t matter if she messed up, as she did on \u201cBreak it Up\u201d, because she offered the instantly immortal words: \u201cI don\u2019t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.\u201d You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O\u2019Connor) Getty Images 15/18 D'Angelo, Hammersmith Apollo, 2015 When D\u2019Angelo released his surprise third record \u2013 the politically fraught Black Messiah \u2013 it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000\u2019s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to \u201cSugah Daddy\u201d, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who's live shows to join in the fun. At one point D\u2019Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D\u2019Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a divine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled \"The Second Coming\". (Roisin O\u2019Connor) Corbis 16/18 Lorde, Brighton Centre, 2017 A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde\u2019s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance \u2013 the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she'd chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance \u2013 and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard) Getty Images 17/18 David Byrne, Brighton Centre, 2018 When you\u2019ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations \u2013 some mind-blowing, others not \u2013 on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne\u2019s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance \u2013 no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones \u2013 and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges) EPA 18/18 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018 Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier \u2013 known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the \"Chris\" for her second album \u2013 tweeted: \u201cI think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!\u201d She delivered on that promise \u2013 falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet \u2013 as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: \u201cVive everyone!\u201d We left thrilled and elated.
