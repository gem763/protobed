(Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)\n\nDana Fisher has studied environmental activism for decades, but the crowds of people who took to the streets Friday to demand aggressive measures against climate change were unlike any she\u2019d seen.\n\nThey were young. They were diverse. And they were overwhelmingly girls.\n\n\u201cSomething different is happening here,\u201d the University of Maryland sociologist said. \u201cWe have a new wave of contention in society that\u2019s being led by women. \u2026 And the youth climate movement is leading this generational shift.\"\n\nIn a survey of more than 100 U.S. organizers of the climate strike and nearly 200 participants in the Washington event, Fisher found that 68 percent of organizers and 58 percent of participants identified as female. People of color made up at least 33 percent of the protesters in Washington \u2014 a proportion that almost matches the racial demographics of the United States.\n\nThese findings jibe with results of a recent poll of American teenagers conducted by The Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation. The poll found that 46 percent of girls said climate change was \u201cextremely important\u201d to them personally, compared with 23 percent of boys. At least twice as many black and Hispanic teens participated in school walkouts on climate change than their white counterparts, and girls were slightly more likely to have attended a walkout than boys.\n\n[\u2018We will make them hear us\u2019: Millions of youths around the world strike for action]\n\nThe female leadership of the climate strikes represents a significant change for a movement that has traditionally been dominated by white men, Fisher said. A 2014 study by the Green Diversity Initiative found that people of color made up about 12 percent of staff members and leadership at nongovernmental environmental organizations and foundations. Thirty percent of top positions in these groups were held by women.\n\nBut those numbers may be starting to shift. A follow-up survey in 2018 found that women constituted 52 percent of senior staff and 40 percent of board members at environmental NGOs, though people of color represented 21 percent of both groups.\n\nThe more diverse crowd at Friday\u2019s strike reflects a sea change that has been underway since the Women\u2019s March in January 2017, Fisher said. Women are at the helms of many of the progressive activist organizations that have sprung up in recent years, including Indivisible and the Sunrise Movement, she noted.\n\nMarine biologist Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, founder of the Urban Ocean Lab and a speaker at the New York climate strike, said she was \u201camazed\u201d by the diversity at Friday\u2019s event.\n\nJohnson, who is 39 years old and black, has long felt that perspectives like hers were sidelined in environmentalism \u2014 a reflection of the overall marginalization of women and people of color in society. But movements such as Black Lives Matter and Me Too \u201chave opened a lot of doors for new people and new voices,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing now to see the climate movement be this nexus for all these different awakenings,\u201d she continued. Environmentalists \u201care realizing we actually do need diversity, not just because it\u2019s nice to have, but that\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll win.\u201d\n\nThe icon of young climate activism is 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, who sparked the school strike movement when she began protesting alone outside the Swedish parliament more than a year ago.\n\nWhen the soft-spoken teenager appeared at New York\u2019s climate rally Friday, the crowd reacted as if she were the headliner of a rock concert. Tens of thousands of schoolkids waited for hours in sweltering heat to see her speak and yelled her name in unison as she took the stage.\n\nTeen girls of color have been at the forefront of the climate movement in America. Isra Hirsi, the 16-year-old executive director of Youth Climate Strike, has spoken about how her identity as a black Muslim woman drives her activism. The teenager-led environmental justice organization Zero Hour was founded by a Latina high schooler, Jamie Margolin.\n\n\u201cMaybe women can just see things that men can\u2019t,\u201d said Alexandria Villase\u00f1or, a 14-year-old who has been protesting in front of the United Nations since December and helped spearhead Friday\u2019s strike in New York. \u201cWe are more likely to believe in change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine a lot of boys following Greta\u2019s lead in the way that teenage girls in the U.S. have been,\u201d said Johnson, who spoke at the New York event. \u201cYou need this willingness to be part of a collective, and to just do what you can with no guaranteed outcome and no even clear rules, and it has been these girls stepping up to try to figure that out.\u201d\n\nHalf of the people who attended Friday\u2019s protest were college age or younger, and a full quarter of them were under 18. Fisher said she\u2019s never seen so many young people at a demonstration.\n\nThey didn\u2019t come from nowhere. Eight in 10 D.C. climate strikers said they had attended another strike or demonstration; nearly 60 percent had attended the March for Our Lives to protest gun violence in 2018.\n\nThe strikers were also remarkably civically engaged; the vast majority of organizers and just under half of the D.C. strike participants had contacted an elected official in the past year. More than 60 percent of organizers had participated in a direct action like the Shut Down DC protests that blocked traffic Monday \u2014 a number Fisher called \u201cridiculously high.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince \u2026 the day after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, the message has been very clear for left-leaning Americans that they can\u2019t sit on their butts and wait for change,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cI think young people have really heard that message, and it was especially clear after the Parkland shooting happened.\"\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re prepared to use all the tools in the democratic toolbox to push for change,\u201d she added.\n\nEmily Guskin contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nMost American teens are frightened by climate change, poll finds, and about 1 in 4 are taking action\n\nHow a seventh-grader\u2019s strike against climate change exploded into a movement\n\nGreta Thunberg to world leaders: \u2018If you fail we will never forgive you\u2019", "description": "\u201cWe have a new wave of contention in society that\u2019s being led by women,\" sociologist Dana Fisher said. \"And the youth climate movement is leading this generational shift.\"", "authors": ["Sarah Kaplan", "Reporter For Speaking Of Science", "September At Am", "Sarah Kaplan Is A Science Reporter Covering News Around The Nation", "Across The Universe.
