President Trump is also expected to attend.\n\nThe news comes as the president is embroiled in an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives, and Kushner has been pushing to beef up the White House communications' response to the investigations.\n\nIt will be a family dinner at the presidential retreat, a spot that the First Family has frequented less, and opted more often for vacation time at the president\u2019s own properties, such as his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach and Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey.\n\nIn fact, the couple had their wedding at Bedminster on Oct. 25, 2009.\n\nIvanka Trump posted on Thursday to her official Twitter account, writing that she was \u201cLooking forward to celebrating 10 amazing years of marriage to my love tomorrow!\u201d\n\nThe event comes days after President Trump withdrew another of his own branded properties, the Trump National Golf Course at Doral, in Florida, from consideration to host the next international summit of the G7 in May. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney called Camp David \"miserable\" and \"way too small\" in trying to justify the idea of hosting the G7 at Doral.\n\n\"I mean, who was here for the last time it was at Camp David?\" he said. \"Was that the perfect place? In fact, I understand the folks who participated in it hated it and thought it was a miserable place to have the G7. It was way too small. It was way too remote. My understanding is this media didn\u2019t like it because you had to drive an hour on a bus to get there either way.\"\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the event.\n\nCover: Jared Kushner, senior White House adviser, left, and Ivanka Trump, assistant to U.S. President Donald Trump, walk on the South Lawn of the White House to board Marine One before departing to Camp David in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Friday, June 1, 2018.
