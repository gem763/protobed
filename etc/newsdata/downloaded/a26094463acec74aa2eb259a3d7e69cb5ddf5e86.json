Exhibit A of this laxity in the staff has been acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. Even back in the spring, Mulvaney adopted a \u201clet Trump be Trump\u201d approach, loosening access to the president and enabling the president\u2019s more disruptive tendencies. He also made it clear to reporters that he enjoyed the perquisites of power and was uninterested in attempting to constrain Trump\u2019s impulses.\n\nThat disinterest in opposing Trump came to a head this past week, first in his disastrous press conference on Thursday and then his almost-as-disastrous Fox News Sunday interview with Chris Wallace.\n\nOne of the amusing aspects of Mulvaney\u2019s witless incompetence as a Trump shill is learning of Jared Kushner\u2019s disenchantment with his performance. When Kushner seems like the more competent person in a staff, that is a sign that the staff has scraped the absolute bottom of the barrel.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Drezner", "Washingtonpost.Com Outlook Its-Staff-Stupid"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
