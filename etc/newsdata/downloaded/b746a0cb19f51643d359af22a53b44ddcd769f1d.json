Some of the squad had their first run in Kenya last weekend and this is now our turn to get going. We want to lay a good foundation to take into the first two tournaments of the year in Dubai and Cape Town.\n\n\"The experience of the squad will help to get us going quickly,\" according to Sage.\n\nThe experience of what is needed to succeed will help another returnee to the squad, Ruhan Nel, to make the transition back to sevens rugby again.\n\nNel last played for the Blitzboks at the Rugby World Cup Sevens in San Francisco in July last year.\n\n\"It becomes very dark on the sevens field very quickly,\" Nel remembers with a smile.\n\n\"It will be a physical and mental challenge getting back out there, but it\u2019s something I want to do. There is nowhere to hide on a sevens pitch, so your fitness levels need to be very high. You must be prepared to give everything you have, even when the tank is empty.\"\n\nNel is not only keen to share the field with Sage and a host of former Blitzboks team-mates, but also facing some old foes from the likes of England, USA and Spain.\n\n\"Yes, I have not played against them in a while, so that will be a good test. You want to be tested in these tournaments to see where you are as a squad and where potential weaknesses in the system are, so it will be great from that perspective. We hope to get into our stride early,\" said the outside centre who toured with the Springboks to Europe a year ago.\n\nBlitzbok squad:\n\nChris Dry, Christi Grobbelaar, Dylan Sage (captain), Zain Davids, Ryan Oosthuizen, JC Pretorius, Selvyn Davids, Rosko Specman, Justin Geduld, Kurt-Lee Arendse, Seabelo Senatla, Ruhan Nel, Muller du Plessis\n\nManagement:\n\nNeil Powell (coach), Hugh Everson (physiotherapist), Ashley Evert (manager), Marius Schoeman (High Performance Manager)", "description": "Dylan Sage has given his Springbok Sevens team-mates advice ahead of this weekend's Athlete's Factory Sevens in Chester.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1246/1b33e0daabd54a269c8267b2f9abb199.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
