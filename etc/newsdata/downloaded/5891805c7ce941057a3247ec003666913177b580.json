Trump\u2019s affinity for Putin and his rejection of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections have brought additional scrutiny to those conversations. The White House has released little or no information about some of the conversations.\n\nAdam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee who is leading the impeachment inquiry, said in a television appearance this weekend that he would seek access to Trump\u2019s conversations with Putin as part of a growing investigation into his alleged abuse of presidential powers to aid his re-election campaign.\n\n\u201cI think the paramount need here is to protect the national security of the United States and see whether in the conversations with other world leaders \u2013 and in particular with Putin \u2013 that the president was also undermining our security in a way that he thought would personally benefit his campaign,\u201d Schiff said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.\n\nIt is not clear how the Kremlin could stop Trump from complying if the documents are subpoenaed by Congress, although the White House could claim the documents are protected by executive privilege.\n\nPeskov\u2019s remarks can also be seen as trolling, creating the perception that Trump is compromised by his relationship with the Kremlin in a show of contempt for current US political attitudes toward Russia.\n\nDemocrats have launched the impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, into investigating his political rival Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nRudy Giuliani: Ukraine sources detail attempt to construct case against Biden Read more\n\nAccording to records of a telephone call and a whistleblower complaint by a member of the intelligence community, Trump blocked military aid to Ukraine before repeatedly telling Zelenskiy on a 25 July call to speak with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani about investigating Biden\u2019s son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower complaint, the Trump administration sought to restrict access to records of his conversation with Zelenskiy by putting them on a system used to hold highly sensitive and classified material. The call did not contain any information pertinent to national security, the whistleblower complaint said, but was potentially embarrassing for Trump.\n\nWhite House officials also sought to limit access to Trump\u2019s conversations with Putin, CNN reported on Friday, refusing to circulate transcripts of at least one telephone call among senior staff. The White House also did not make available transcripts of calls between Trump and the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, after the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to the news station, in an effort to prevent leaks.", "description": "Few details have emerged of at least 11 phone calls and in-person meetings but Dimitri Peskov said: \u2018If the American send us signals, then we\u2019ll discuss it\u2019", "authors": ["Andrew Roth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7688486cc4cbd2110b3aea865b4134bf3b4ea3f/70_0_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ef8e380ddb4bb7364de688ed32d74d50", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
