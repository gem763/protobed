We were confident enough to think we\u2019d make the semifinals, so we feel like we are well prepared for the game.\u201d\n\nA veteran of four World Cups - he coached his native Australia to the final in 2003 and then guided Japan in 2015, and was a consultant with the Springboks in their title-winning campaign in 2007 - the 59-year-old Jones has a wealth of experience to deal with huge matches like the one approaching on Saturday.\n\nHe said his job was to \u201cminimize the stress for your players and allow them to be free, allow them to have a clear head.\u201d\n\nIt explains why Jones has thrown so many barbs at the All Blacks this week in three separate sessions with the media, including accusing someone of spying on his team\u2019s training session on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to have a bit of fun, isn\u2019t it?\u201d a smiling Jones told a packed news conference at a Tokyo hotel near the city\u2019s Disneyland resort.\n\nSo, he was asked, was it all mind games?\n\n\u201cHow do you define mind games?\u201d Jones responded.\n\nHis incendiary remarks this week were an example, it was put to the Australian.\n\n\u201cThen maybe we are having mind games,\u201d Jones said, laughing.\n\nHe has tried everything to pile the pressure on the All Blacks in public. Behind the scenes, meanwhile, he has been texting New Zealand counterpart Steve Hansen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m chuckling away,\u201d Hansen said earlier Thursday, \u201cand I get a text (saying), \u2018How you going, Steve?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m going fine, thanks Eddie.\u2019 He\u2019s laughing, I\u2019m laughing.\u201d\n\nThe serious business for Jones this week was selecting a team to take on New Zealand, and telling eight players in his 31-man squad they would not be involved in England\u2019s first World Cup semifinal match since 2007.\n\nThe headline selection was the return of flyhalf George Ford to the starting lineup, which moved captain Owen Farrell to inside center and meant Henry Slade dropped to the bench.\n\nThirteen players in the England squad were part of the British and Irish Lions party that earned a 1-1 series draw against the All Blacks in 2017.\n\n\u201cI think if you have experienced that before you understand what you have got to prepare yourself for,\u201d Jones said, \u201cand most of our squad have been involved in those games so we\u2019ve got great experience.\n\n\u201cThey know what New Zealand\u2019s going to bring to the game and they have practised this week to be equipped for it.\u201d\n\nFord wasn\u2019t one of those 13, but he believes he knows what it will take to beat the world\u2019s most celebrated rugby team.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have to be on our toes,\u201d he said, \u201cand alive in every moment of the game.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "England's players only began thinking about their Rugby World Cup semifinal match against New Zealand when the final whistle sounded on the defending champions' win over Ireland on Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Douglas"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
