He's in the group so he has a chance to play. We have had this morning a very good conversation, Mesut and me, and I said to him I haven't changed my idea about him.\n\n'He knows what I want from him because it's the same as last season in the first day of pre-season training when we had a conversation. It's the same as one month ago and in that way, some circumstances weren't helping us in every moment to be consistent or available to play.\n\n'But I will say I think the last weeks he has progressively been training well and adding his spirit to help us. For example, our conversation this morning was because I wanted to listen to him about how he's thinking now to help us and be with us tomorrow. Then if we are in the same spirit and the same idea, to play. It was a very good conversation and tomorrow he's in the group.'", "description": "Arsenal travel to Anfield for a place in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals and Ray Parlour believes the game could be the perfect time for Unai Emery to bring Mesut Ozil back in from the cold.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/08/20332226-0-Mesut_Ozil_right_is_pictured_in_training_on_Tuesday_for_Arsenal_-a-15_1572422548259.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
