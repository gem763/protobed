However, a man who answered a call to that number put the phone down when he heard it was the police.\n\nThe Hawks were called to investigate the matter, said the Hawks' Mpumalanga spokesperson, Captain Dineo Sekgotodi.\n\nSekgodi said officials established that the baby had been kidnapped shortly after birth from a Bellville hospital, when her biological mother complained that she did not feel well.\n\nSekgotodi said staff at the hospital told the Hawks that a woman who pretended to be a family member of the sick mother, offered to look after the baby.\n\n\n\nCraig, is in custody and her case was postponed to August 20 for a bail application.\n\nSekgotodi says the baby has been taken to a place of safety until she can be reunited with her 26-year-old mother.", "description": "A 44-year-old Cape Town woman is facing kidnapping and human trafficking charges after she allegedly tried to get an affidavit from the police in Mbombela, Mpumalanga, to help her adopt a baby.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9233/4a104333ecb84746a6653e400fdeae43.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-14"}
