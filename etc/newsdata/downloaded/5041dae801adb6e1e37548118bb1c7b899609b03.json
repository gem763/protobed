The streaming giant has recently said goodbye to two of its biggest, and earliest shows \u2013 the political drama House of Cards bowed out last year, while the prison-based dramedy Orange is the New Black concluded with its seventh season this summer. Meanwhile it has increasingly been cancelling newer, buzzier properties such as American Vandal, Tuca and Bertie and The OA prematurely, despite the fact they\u2019ve been critically acclaimed.\n\nMore like this\n\n- The show like nothing else on TV\n\n- Nine TV shows to watch in September\n\n- Are Mafia dramas becoming too real?\n\nGone are the days when Netflix had a reputation for renewing everything \u2013 anything \u2013 to beef up its gargantuan streaming library. In 2019, the service is no less cautious \u2013 and ruthless \u2013 than any traditional TV network. And because they only selectively release viewing figures, it\u2019s still hard to figure out what kind of content is latching on. When it comes to original programming, it certainly doesn\u2019t help that the sheer amount of new shows across the TV landscape is going to continue to rise \u2013 thanks to ever more rival streaming services launching, including Disney+, Apple TV and HBO Max.\n\nOne strategy Netflix seems to be using to try and keep its stock high is roping in the right behind-the-camera talent; producers, writers or directors who have as much of a personal brand as someone starring in a TV show. Star producer Shonda Rhimes signed a nine-figure deal to produce eight shows for Netflix. And Murphy, responsible for shows such as Glee, Nip/Tuck and the American Horror Story anthology series, signed a deal so large The Hollywood Reporter dubbed him \u2018TV\u2019s first $300m man.\u201d The Politician is the first of the star signing\u2019s confirmed projects for the streamer, and while it isn\u2019t a flawless debut in any sense, the show\u2019s long-term potential is worth getting excited about.\n\nThis first season is too blunt a tool for Murphy to definitively to carve out his space in Netflix\u2019s vast empire\n\nThe Politician\u2019s premise is both familiar and unusual, and plays out like a teen reimagining of House of Cards set at a left-of-left liberal high school in Santa Barbara. Peyton Hobart (Ben Platt) is running for school president because it\u2019s part of his audacious, life-long plan to end up as president of the United States. His route to the White House is meticulously crafted; since the age of seven he has studied the lives of former presidents, the better to home in on common experiences and traits so that he can emulate all of their successes and steer clear of their failures. Seven presidents went to Harvard, so he, too, must go to Harvard, or so he says in the opening of the pilot episode.\n\nThroughout its intended run \u2013 a second season has already been confirmed, though four to six are expected in total \u2013 the show is planning to observe Hobart through key stages of his life as he climbs towards the White House; it\u2019s definitely an exciting premise, which will allow the setting and supporting cast to change each year, echoing the template Murphy established in his other anthology shows American Horror Story and American Crime Story. But unfortunately this first season feels chaotic and messy, too blunt a tool for Murphy definitively to carve out his space in Netflix\u2019s vast empire.\n\nThere is still a lot to like; Platt, known primarily for his Broadway work (Book of Mormon, Dear Evan Hansen) and his role in the Pitch Perfect franchise, is the perfect choice to play a charming yet scheming sociopath. Adults adore Hobart; his fellow classmates are terrified of him \u2013 and his adoptive mother, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, sincerely tells him \u201cyour ambition frightens me.\u201d Paltrow is, sadly, underused and phoning it in through most of the season, as a static matriarch bored of her opulent life. She is supposed to be a zen anchor among the chaos but the role fails to exploit the camp and self-awareness she brought to her brief stint on Murphy\u2019s Glee.\n\nThe show\u2019s fantastic credits sequence, a literal expression of the idea that humans are the sum of their experiences, sees diplomas, antidepressants, presidential tomes, a matchbox from a strip club and even an intriguing, Chekhovian smattering of silver bullets assembled into wooden compartments that then join to form Hobart\u2019s body. But unlike the artefacts in its intro, The Politician isn\u2019t capable of wielding all its constituent parts into a cohesive narrative.\n\nMurphy\u2019s trademark dark humour seems curiously tempered; while there are digs at identity politics, and a cancer patient who is Hobart\u2019s running mate is routinely harvested for jokes, the characters\u2019 archly dead-behind-the-eyes delivery just feels flat. The script is also largely devoid of any real feeling: the younger members of the cast all have a lot to do, but rarely does it feel like anything they say is worth caring about.\n\nBette Midler is a genuinely brilliant bit of casting \u2013 though it would be a spoiler to say any more about her role\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the show doesn\u2019t have standout moments; one episode deftly adapts the premise of Gone Girl to great effect. Another focuses on an apathetic voter sitting on the fence of the high-school elections and the smothering he endures by Hobart and his opponent as they desperately chase swing voters. Here, Murphy\u2019s use of high-school drama as a tool to examine real world politics \u2013 with nods to the 2016 US election, in particular \u2013 gives us insight into what he might have been thinking when he made this show in the first place.\n\nPlatt gives a densely layered and complex performance, but the rest of the young supporting cast playing his peers \u2013 including Zoey Deutch, Lucy Boynton and Laura Dreyfuss \u2013 are far too thinly sketched. One of the most compelling characters is River (David Corenswet), a preppy, statuesque classmate whose intimate relationship with Hobart is when we see the titular politician for who he really is. It\u2019s just a shame he\u2019s used too sparingly as the underlying queerness of their relationship is so potent. Of the older guard, Jessica Lange is striking as the grandmother to Infinity, the aforementioned cancer patient, while January Jones\u2019s brief appearance is fairly unremarkable. Bette Midler, however, is a genuinely brilliant bit of casting \u2013 though it would be a spoiler to say any more about her role.\n\nAll that said, The Politician is enjoyable, and there\u2019s something in letting a show find its feet. Shows with dynamic, perfectly sculpted debuts often struggle to bear the weight of their acclaim beyond their first series \u2013 see Big Little Lies and Killing Eve \u2013 but here is one that has adaptability built into its DNA, with new locations, characters and challenges meeting Hobart at every stage of his political career. The finale, which acts as something of an epilogue to season one and a prologue to season two, certainly sets up The Politician as a show that\u2019s worth investing in.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nLove TV?
