Federal law states that asylum seekers may work but aren\u2019t entitled to do so.\n\nThe administration has long argued that migrants from Central America, who make up the majority of those illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, are attracted by the U.S. asylum system. Immigrants who pass an initial \u201ccredible fear\u201d interview are often allowed to remain in the U.S. for years as their claims wend their way through the backlogged immigration-court system, and in the meantime these immigrants are permitted to work.\n\nPrevious administrations have viewed work permits as a way of making sure these asylum seekers remain self-sufficient in the U.S. But the Trump administration regards the opportunity to work\u2014and send remittances back to workers\u2019 home countries\u2014as a major driver of illegal immigration.\n\nImmigrant-rights advocates argue that by cutting off the ability to work, the government is pushing an already-vulnerable group of people into a more desperate situation. Asylum seekers aren\u2019t eligible for government benefits.\n\n\u201cThis proposed rule would impact asylum seekers\u2019 ability to work legally and has the potential to drive people to work under the table,\u201d said Dan Kosten, assistant director of policy and advocacy for skills and workforce development at the National Immigration Forum.\n\nIn the government\u2019s 2018 budget year, the USCIS granted 1.6 million work permits, though it wasn\u2019t immediately known how many of those went to asylum seekers.\n\nAlso on Friday, Democracy Forward, a legal organization, filed a lawsuit in the District of Columbia district court on behalf of several asylum seekers against USCIS, alleging that several recent policy changes make it tougher for immigrants to pass their initial \u201ccredible fear\u201d interviews. Those policy changes include shortening the time asylum seekers have to consult with lawyers before their interviews and curtailing an immigrant\u2019s ability to delay an interview while seeking counsel or searching for documents.\n\nThe suit also alleges that any policy put forth by the USCIS is unlawful because its acting director, Mr. Cuccinelli, was installed without Congress\u2019s approval, jumping ahead of senior agency officials or others at the Department of Homeland Security who could have been elevated.\n\nWrite to Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com", "description": "The Trump administration supports making it harder for asylum seekers to receive work permits while they wait for their cases to be decided, a move that could deter some immigrants from entering the country illegally.", "authors": ["Michelle Hackman", "Michelle.Hackman Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104939/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
