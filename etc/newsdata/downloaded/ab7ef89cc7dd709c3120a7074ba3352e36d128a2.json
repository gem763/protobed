He isn\u2019t boisterous. He presents as stoic. People who watch games with him describe him as inquisitive but even-keeled, reacting not to a specific bounce but more interested in how it fits in the larger picture. At that moment, since his family officially took over the Nationals in July 2006, he had presided over 2,168 regular-season games and 28 more in the postseason. He had closed old RFK Stadium and opened a new ballpark. He had hired and fired managers. This is what it built to.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just amazing,\u201d Lerner said to his daughter. \u201cI\u2019m so happy.\u201d\n\nIt was his 94th birthday.\n\n\u201cPure joy,\u201d Debra said last week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s indescribable the happiness we saw on his face,\u201d Mark Lerner said.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 upcoming appearance in the World Series \u2014 a first for this franchise, the first for Washington in 86 years \u2014 means so many different things to so many different people. For the players, just a handful of whom have reached this point, it\u2019s a professional peak \u2013 with possibility still ahead. For the fans, so many of whom have suffered through previous October disappointments \u2014 not to mention 33 years without any baseball team at all \u2014 it is a potent cocktail of adrenaline and emotion. For General Manager Mike Rizzo and his staff, it is validation that their methods of scouting, developing and evaluating players works.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the stage, Lerner reveled in a moment that brought a kind of attention for his very different from the opening of a mall or development of an office building. \u201cI want to tell our fans: This is for you,\u201d Lerner said into a microphone, his words carrying out to those in the stands and a television audience beyond.\n\nBut for Ted Lerner, the Nats\u2019 pennant is about more than the fans. When the Nationals themselves had climbed down from the makeshift stage at the center of the ballfield, the trophy secured, Ted Lerner remained atop it. Still to come were the photos he had waited for. There, then, were his wife Annette and his three children, his sons-in-law and daughter-in-law, his grandkids.\n\nFor Ted Lerner, this was about family.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously very accomplished and very successful, super-smart, very self-confident,\u201d said Stan Kasten, the former president of the Nationals who now oversees the Los Angeles Dodgers. \u201cBut he is totally dedicated to family above all else \u2014 above all else. . . .\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEverything came down to how it worked within his family and reflected on his family. There\u2019s nothing more important to Ted than that.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how the Lerners pursued a baseball team. That\u2019s how they have run a baseball team. So that\u2019s how they celebrated a pennant. With the Lerners, there are no 5-3 votes. There\u2019s only consensus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a family dynamic,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cWe make decisions as a group. There are no knee-jerk decisions, no snap judgments. It\u2019s a deliberate process that takes the knowledge and the support of the whole family.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t how Ted Lerner built the Nationals. It\u2019s how Ted Lerner lives his life. He\u2019s so disciplined that until recently, his longtime tailor kept the same waist measurement from his 30s \u2014 and now he has to take them in. He\u2019s so pious that he won\u2019t attend Friday night games because of the Jewish Shabbat. Those qualities are reflected in his stewardship of the Nationals.\n\nFamily first, and last\n\nBy the time Major League Baseball decided to move the Montreal Expos to Washington following the 2004 season, the Lerners had flirted with sports ownership before. Mark Lerner thinks he was probably 8 when he began pestering his father, one of the most successful real estate developers in the country, about owning a team.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m at fault,\u201d Mark said in an interview Friday at Nationals Park in which his two sisters joined by video conference. \u201cSince I was a little guy, I always said to my dad, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be cool to have one of our own?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Lerners made a run at the Washington Redskins in the late 1990s, when the NFL awarded the team to Daniel M. Snyder. They had monitored the potential moves of the San Francisco Giants and the San Diego Padres, disappointed each time. Mark bought into Ted Leonsis\u2019s group that owns hockey\u2019s Capitals and basketball\u2019s Wizards.\n\nStill, in order to pursue the town\u2019s new baseball team, Ted and Mark couldn\u2019t be the only Lerners on board. \u201cIt was kind of a guy thing at the time,\u201d Debra said. Because decisions such as this have to be an everyone thing, the family wrestled with it. When they decided to move forward, Mark sent flowers to his sisters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe knew we might have a venture one day that we wanted to pursue, and we\u2019d need his support,\u201d Debra said.\n\nTo get the team, the Lerners would not only have to pay MLB\u2019s asking price of $450 million, but also beat out a half-dozen competitors. The arbiter was Bud Selig, then baseball\u2019s commissioner, who invited Ted Lerner to his office in Milwaukee as part of the interview process. Lerner, who also includes sons-in-law Ed Cohen and Bob Tanenbaum in his businesses and family decision-making, brought his entire family.\n\nSelig had previously owned the Milwaukee Brewers, which he turned into a family business. He had a strong affinity not only for local ownership, but for family ownership. Selig\u2019s mentor in baseball had been John Fetzer, the late owner of the Detroit Tigers, a family guy.\n\n\u201cWhen Ted came to Milwaukee with his family, he said, \u2018I know how you felt about Mr. Fetzer,\u2019\u201d Selig said in a phone interview last week. \u201cHe told me he was going to be my John Fetzer of this generation. The only thing I\u2019ll say: He didn\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d\n\nA different kind of business\n\nThe Lerners officially took control of the team in July 2006, and if he taught those who worked for him and others throughout baseball about his own family\u2019s importance in the operation, the baseball experience reminded his family of his defining characteristic: patience.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the most patient person I know,\u201d Mark Lerner said.\n\nThe Nationals were in a shambles \u2014 not just because they played at dingy old RFK Stadium, and not just because they were headed to the first of what would be six straight losing seasons. The minor leagues had no prospects. The scouting and player development departments had the lowest budgets in baseball. As a young man, Ted Lerner borrowed money from his wife to buy his first property \u2014 and become a billionaire. He built Tyson\u2019s Corner. He built White Flint Mall. He hadn\u2019t built a baseball team.\n\n\u201cI think he went in with eyes wide open that literally the bricks and mortar of a real estate business are hard to translate to a baseball business,\u201d said Marla Lerner Tanenbaum, his younger daughter. \u201cThe chance that\u2019s involved with baseball, the randomness that can be involved in baseball, is not really a big presence in the real estate business. There are facts. There are numbers. So I think the first thing he could really attack were the numbers, the financial situation of the franchise that he acquired. He dug into that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe stories from those early years, as the Lerners learned baseball, are part of Nationals\u2019 lore. Why did minor-league coaches need stopwatches? Why did each player need so many bats? Does this package really need to be sent FedEx? Why do scouts spend so much traveling from place to place? To baseball lifers, such questions were insulting. But Ted Lerner wasn\u2019t going to just accept baseball\u2019s norms until \u2014 and unless \u2014 he understood them.\n\n\u201cHe would learn where the potholes are and how to avoid them,\u201d said Kasten, who served as the team\u2019s president from the time the Lerners took over through the 2010 season. \u201cSometimes conforming is the way to go. Sometimes being contrarian is the way to go.\u201d\n\nAll the while, though, he was soliciting opinions. Even in his late 70s, he knew there were other owners and executives who understood baseball better than he did. Lerner picked up the phone and made the calls to try to figure it out. He met for hours with Scott Boras, the super agent with whom he has built a tight relationship and done several deals because, as Boras said last week, \u201cHe wanted to hear about the business from my side.\u201d\n\n\u201cI took several calls from him in those first few years. \u2018What\u2019s your strategy on the minor leagues? What kind of resources do you put into ballpark repairs?\u2019\u201d said Larry Baer, the CEO of the San Francisco Giants who is also a part owner. \u201cHe had a very inquisitive, active mind, and wasn\u2019t somebody who\u2019s sitting back and doing it for recognition.\u201d\n\nPatience rewarded\n\nPursuing something for recognition is actually counter to how Lerner conducts himself. He declined to be interviewed for this story, and over the years has spoken rarely, and in almost no detail, about how his team functions. Developing a mall can benefit the public, but it is a private pursuit. Selig long has referred to baseball as a \u201csocial institution.\u201d Explaining the family\u2019s thinking publicly is an aspect of ownership Lerner has avoided.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing like the business of sports,\u201d said Mark Attanasio, a financier who bought the Brewers in late 2004. \u201cEverything you do is under a microscope. Imagine being on Wall Street and making all these deals over the course of a day, and then at the end of the day having to explain all your decisions publicly. That\u2019s the position Ted found himself in. It\u2019s a transition for all of us.\u201d\n\nLerner has left the explaining to others \u2014 even in the early days. During his time as the team\u2019s president, Kasten was the most prominent forward-facing figure, but when he departed, he wasn\u2019t replaced. Mark Lerner writes letters to the fan base following major decisions and occasionally speaks for the family in interviews. But since he became the club\u2019s permanent general manager in 2009, Rizzo most often outlines the team\u2019s thinking \u2014 even though such decisions have been reached through discussions with the family. Last year, Ted Lerner transferred official stewardship of the club to Mark. But the patriarch\u2019s voice still matters.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the type of leader that allows you to voice your opinion \u2014 and sometimes vehemently voice your opinion,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cHe wants your true outlook and your true opinion and does not want to hear what you think he wants to hear.\u201d\n\nFrom 2006-10, only one franchise lost more games than the Nationals. From 2012 through this year, only one team has won more. To a nascent fan base, reaching the World Series could have seemed distant, if not impossible. To Ted Lerner, it was something to build toward at no one else\u2019s pace but his own. Sports inherently involve emotions, and the Lerner family isn\u2019t immune to them.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be around me after a loss,\u201d Mark Lerner said.\n\nTed Lerner doesn\u2019t ride that roller-coaster. That\u2019s why his joy Tuesday night mattered so much to his family, the people who matter most to him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that I would ever have that patience,\u201d Mark Lerner said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Debbie and Marla would either. I give him a lot of credit. That\u2019s very hard to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to continue to do it the right way whether I\u2019m here or not.\u2019 For a man of his age, to say, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. You have to be patient.\u2019 To me it\u2019s extraordinary.\u201d", "description": "Making baseball decisions the same way he became a billionaire developer, lifelong Washingtonian is relishing the moment.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MU61MrOIGKf6sYGYWtbik3IGIb0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q2XNMJHSSII6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
