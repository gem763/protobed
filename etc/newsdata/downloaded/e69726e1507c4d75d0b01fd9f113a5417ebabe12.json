Gold is gold.\"\n\nRussia's athletics federation has been suspended since a 2015 report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of mass doping in the sport.\n\nSince then some Russian athletes have been cleared by the IAAF, athletics' global body, to compete internationally as neutrals after demonstrating that they were training in a doping-free environment.\n\nBarred from wearing their national colors or celebrating with their flag, Russia's neutral athletes are serenaded by the IAAF anthem if they win gold.\n\nSidorova's all-time best result left American rival Sandi Morris with silver in her third successive major championship. Greek Ekaterini Stefanidi, the title-holder and Olympic champion, took bronze.\n\nMorris, the 2016 Olympic silver medalist, said she had no hard feelings about Sidorova's status as a neutral athlete.\n\n\"Sidorova is a friend of mine,\" Morris said. \"She can't help what is going on politically.\"\n\nDrained by her showdown with Morris, Sidorova said she knew her final jump was her last chance to claim the title.\n\n\"I thought this is a chance that needed to be taken,\" she said. \"If not, I would have had to jump again and I didn't really have the strength at that point.\"\n\nWhen she returns to Russia, Sidorova plans to celebrate her gold medal with whipped cream she bought before traveling to Doha.\n\n\"I'll come home and just eat it all,\" she said, chuckling.", "description": "Athletics: Gold is gold even without my flag, says Russian champion Sidorova", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8S0UG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
