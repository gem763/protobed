The information collected on the spreadsheet was based on medical records that state investigators had access to during inspections, according to the Star.\n\nWilliams was testifying before the state Administrative Hearing Commission, a nonpartisan panel that oversees cases involving state agencies and private citizens. The hearing is focused on whether the state was justified in refusing to renew the Planned Parenthood clinic\u2019s license to perform abortions after an inspection raised concern over alleged unsafe procedures.\n\nThe St. Louis clinic is the only abortion clinic in the state.\n\nPlanned Parenthood advocates described the health department\u2019s attempts to track patients\u2019 menstrual cycles as \u201cdeeply disturbing.\u201d\n\nMissouri House Minority Leader Crystal Quade (D) called for the state to investigate whether Williams violated patient privacy laws.\n\n\u201cState law requires the health department director to be \u2018of recognized character and integrity,\u2019\u201d Quade said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cThis unsettling behavior calls into question whether Dr. Williams meets that high standard.\u201d\n\nWe've learned deeply disturbing information: Randall Williams, the director of @GovParsonMO\u2019s Dept. of Health & Senior Services, \"kept a spreadsheet to track the menstrual periods of women who visited Planned Parenthood.\u201d https://t.co/B9nFAaJqvi #ShowMeAccess #StandWithPP #MoLeg \u2014 Planned Parenthood Advocates in Missouri (@PPMO_Advocates) October 29, 2019\n\nState health officials refused to renew the Planned Parenthood clinic\u2019s abortion license in June, citing safety concerns and claiming that the clinic failed to meet certain standards, according to The Associated Press and St. Louis Public Radio.\n\nDuring a March inspection of the clinic, an investigator found that it took the clinic five attempts to successfully complete one woman\u2019s abortion, AP reported. The clinic couldn\u2019t provide health officials with a \u201ccomplication report\u201d for that incident, which prompted the health department to further investigate the clinic and review medical records from women who underwent abortion procedures.\n\nDuring that inquiry, investigators found four other instances involving patients who underwent failed abortions and had to return to the clinic to have another procedure, according to the Star.\n\nDr. David Eisenberg, a physician who works with Planned Parenthood, said the cases the state\u2019s health department were focusing on were rare cases.\n\n\u201cThey have twisted the process in a way that four patients might jeopardize the health of over one million women in the state of Missouri, because those four patients experienced a rare but known complication,\u201d Eisenberg said, according to St. Louis Public Radio.\n\nPlanned Parenthood advocates claim that the state is withholding the clinic\u2019s licensure in a politically motivated attempt to cut off women\u2019s access to abortions.\n\n\u201cHealth officials clearly took advantage of the licensure process to access patient records & use that information to conduct a witch hunt with one goal: to end abortion access,\u201d Planned Parenthood Advocates in Missouri tweeted Tuesday.\n\nYamelsie Rodriguez, president of the Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, criticized the state for tracking women\u2019s menstrual cycles.\n\n\u201cMissouri\u2019s top health official, Randall Williams, scrutinized menstrual cycles of women in this state in order to end abortion access,\u201d Rodriguez said in a statement to AP.\n\nHealth officials clearly took advantage of the licensure process to access patient records & use that information to conduct a witch hunt with one goal: to end abortion access. https://t.co/B9nFAaJqvi #ShowMeAccess #StandWithPP #MoLeg \u2014 Planned Parenthood Advocates in Missouri (@PPMO_Advocates) October 29, 2019\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Williams revealed that he was \u201cpro-life\u201d and had never performed an abortion, the Kansas City Star reported. He also said that the state\u2019s concerns about the clinic were \u201cgrave\u201d but \u201cimminently fixable,\u201d suggesting that Planned Parenthood could still obtain its license if its concerns were addressed.\n\n\u201cBecause we now talked to clinicians that took care of those patients, we are very, very far along on feeling (we can improve) that care with some new policies that we can collaborate with them to implement,\u201d Williams said during his testimony.\n\nIn May, Missouri Gov. Mike Parsons (R) signed into law a ban on most abortions that take place eight weeks after a woman conceives. The law was supposed to go into effect in August. However, a judge temporarily blocked it as Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union challenge the law in court.", "description": "The efforts to track menstrual cycles were part of a larger investigation into claims of unsafe practices at the state's lone abortion clinic, according ...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db8acf5210000283bad4478.jpeg?cache=dscgknseth&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
