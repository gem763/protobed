Ty Long, the punter, made a 39-yard field goal at the end of the first half, but he also missed from 39 and 41 yards in the second half.\n\nBut the Lions made mistakes of their own. Kicker Matt Prater missed a field goal and an extra point, and Matthew Stafford threw two interceptions. Rivers and the Chargers led 10-6 in the third quarter and appeared poised to increase their advantage.\n\nJustin Jackson broke free for a 60-yard touchdown run, but that was called back for holding toward the end of the play. Then Rivers threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to Austin Ekeler, only to have that brought back for an illegal block.\n\nIt still appeared Los Angeles would reach the end zone. The Chargers had first-and-goal from the 1 - but Ekeler fumbled trying to leap toward the goal line. He\u2019d scored in similar fashion earlier in the game.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a time to leap, and there\u2019s a time to run through,\u201d coach Anthony Lynn said. \u201cUsually in a got-to-have-it situation, you can go over the top and extend the ball, but that definitely wasn\u2019t a got-to-have-it situation. The ball should have been secured.\u201d\n\nThe Lions recovered the fumble, and the Chargers never did score again. After falling behind, they drove into field goal range, but on third-and-19 from the Detroit 28, Rivers threw deep into coverage for Keenan Allen and was intercepted by Darius Slay with 1:03 remaining.\n\n\u201cWe were just trying to make a play at the end of the game, probably was too aggressive,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIf we could do it again, probably drop it off short and go for a field goal.\u201d\n\nRivers said no matter how the play looked, he didn\u2019t think it was any kind of desperation throw.\n\n\u201cSlay\u2019s back was turned to me, so I thought, Keenan maybe, interference maybe, or incomplete and let\u2019s go kick it,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t think interception or I wouldn\u2019t have thrown it.\u201d\n\nIt was a frustrating ending for Los Angeles on a day the Chargers rolled up 424 yards.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t fumble the ball on the 1-yard line, we can\u2019t have two touchdowns called back with penalties, we\u2019ve got to make our damn kicks,\u201d Lynn said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Philip Rivers rattled off a lengthy list of problems for the Los Angeles Chargers, trying to avoid using his team's health issues as an excuse.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/chargers_lions_football_66879_c0-68-1621-1013_s1770x1032.jpg?2323cf831d71335c1502a579fa56a6240a2ebd36", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
