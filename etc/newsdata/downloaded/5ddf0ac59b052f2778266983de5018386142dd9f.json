The perpetrators also scrawled the word \u201ctraitor\u201d in green paint across posters of the independence leader.\n\nLocal police in Rewa confirmed to the BBC that they were investigating the incident on three separate counts, including \u201cimputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration,\u201d \u201cintentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace,\u201d and \u201cstatements conducing to public mischief.\u201d\n\nThe caretaker of the Bapu Bhawan memorial, the site where the former independence leader was buried, denounced the theft as \u201cshameful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI opened the gate of the Bhawan early in the morning because it was Gandhi\u2019s birthday,\u201d he told Indian website The Wire. \u201cWhen I returned at around 11 pm, I found the mortal remains of Gandhi missing and his poster was defaced.\u201d\n\nInvestigations into the incident began after the leader of the local Congress political party, Gurmeet Singh, filed a complaint. Singh told the same website that \u201cGandhi\u2019s ideology has been shamed again\u201d and that the attack must have been carried out by Hindu nationalists who were follower\u2019s of Gandhi\u2019s killer.\n\n\u201cThis unlawful act must have been done by the followers of Gandhi\u2019s assassin Nathuram Godse,\u201d he said. \u201cThis madness must stop. I urge Rewa police to check CCTV cameras installed inside Bapu Bhawan and nab the accused.\u201d\n\nDespite being a figure revered around the world, with his supporters regarding him as the \u201cFather of the Nation,\u201d Gandhi\u2019s legacy remains unpopular with many Hindu nationalists opposed to his efforts to create Hindu-Muslim unity.\n\nIndia is currently governed by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, whose leader Narendra Modi just this week paid tribute to Gandhi in an op-ed for The New York Times. describing him as the best \u201cteacher to guide us.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom uniting those who believe in humanity to furthering sustainable development and ensuring economic self-reliance, Gandhi offers solutions to every problem,\u201d wrote Modi.\n\nHowever, many on the hardline wing of the party do not share the same enthusiasm, instead blaming him for dividing the country and the consequent bloodshed during the Partition of India, which saw India and Pakistan morphed into separate states following their declaration of independence from the British Empire in 1947.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Thieves in India this week removed some of the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi from the ground on what would have been his 150th birthday.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Mahatma-Gandhi-Central-Press-Getty-Images-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
