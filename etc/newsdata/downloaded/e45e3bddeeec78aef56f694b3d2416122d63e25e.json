Over the last 18 months, trading in our stores and market conditions on the high street have significantly worsened.\"\n\nConnolly said Brexit was a key factor in the firm's demise.\n\n\"The delay in Brexit has created negativities both in the global markets towards Britain and damaged consumer sentiment and retail footfall on the high street,\" she said.\n\n\"These have compounded the challenges we were facing and without such a delay, it is feasible to believe that our issues would have been more manageable. Instead, it has only intensified the pressures.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nTony Wright, joint administrator and partner at FRP, said: \u201cBonmarch\u00e9 has been a staple on the UK high street for nearly three decades, but the persistent challenges facing retail have taken their toll and led to the administration.\n\n\"There is every sign that we can continue trading while we market Bonmarch\u00e9 for sale and believe that there will be interest to take on the business.\u201d\n\nThe directors placed the business in administration after a sustained period of \"challenging trading conditions and cashflow pressure\", meaning the business was unable to meet financial obligations.\n\nThe administrators will keep Bonmarch\u00e9 stores open while looking into options for the business.\n\nEarlier this year Peacocks boss Philip Day took control of the high street retailer with his his Spectre investment vehicle. That investment has now been wiped out.\n\nThe deal valued the Yorkshire-based chain at around \u00a35.7million - just five years ago the firm was worth nearly \u00a3100million.\n\nA spokesperson for Spectre said: \"We are disappointed with the result of our investment in Bonmarch\u00e9, but our primary thought at this time is with the business' employees and families.\"\n\n(Image: Stoke Sentinel)\n\nBonmarch\u00e9, which was founded in 1982, warned last in March that trading had deteriorated, adding that it expected to lose around \u00a35million this year.\n\nThe Wakefield-based business employs a total of 2,887 people, including 200 staff at its head office, and trades through 318 stores across the UK, online and by phone.\n\nConnolly said: \"We would like to thank Spectre and their team of advisors for their advice, guidance and support over the last few months. We believe that if we had had an opportunity to work with the Spectre team closely at an earlier stage, another outcome would have been possible.\n\n\"Our first priority is to our colleagues and their families in the face of this difficult news. This is not the outcome we had hoped for and we will work with the administrators to do all it possibly can to protect as many jobs as possible and work towards finding a buyer for the business that can secure its future going forward.\"", "description": "The fashion chain has more than 300 shops and concessions and employs 2,900 people - it's now on the hunt for a new buyer", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Uig Via Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Stoke Sentinel"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14223986.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bonmarche-clothes-shop-Hamilton-Road-Felixstowe-Suffolk-England-UK.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
