He said that it wasn\u2019t pressure because he \u201cknows when he gives pressure\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Meyers asked. \u201cI know when I give pressure. Trump\u2019s only defence is I know when I commit a crime and that\u2019s not a crime.\u201d\n\nTrump has also said that Nancy Pelosi launched the impeachment inquiry before she read the transcript of the call, and after reading it she allegedly regretted what she started, as it was such a great call. \u201cAt this point he\u2019s just writing fan fiction about Nancy Pelosi,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s strangest soundbite arrived when he spoke to press by the chopper on Thursday and said he thinks Ukraine and China should both investigate Hunter Biden. \u201cHe basically just blew the whistle on himself,\u201d he said. \u201cHe should have a whistle around his neck at all times.\u201d\n\nTrump has also brought up the fact that Mike Pence has spoken to Zelensky and his calls are also being looked at. \u201cNo one deserves to be dragged down by Trump more than Mike Pence,\u201d he said.\n\nStephen Colbert: \u2018He will not shut the old hamburger hole\u2019\n\nOn The Late Show, Stephen Colbert also spoke about Trump\u2019s inability to keep quiet. \u201cThe constitution gives the accused the right to remain silent and clearly, Donald Trump has never read the constitution because he will not shut the old hamburger hole,\u201d he said.\n\nColbert said that the more Trump reveals, it \u201cjust makes him guiltier\u201d. He also referenced the chopper talk where he implicated himself. \u201cThat is literally what they\u2019re impeaching you for!\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t say that out loud!\u201d\n\nHe also joked about Trump now bringing China into the conversation. \u201cJust when you think Trump can\u2019t dig himself a deeper hole, he literally reaches China.\u201d\n\nThis week also saw Trump visiting The Villages in Florida, a retirement community that has been referred to as an adult Disney World. During a speech, Trump joked that he should be retiring with the audience. \u201cYes, you should \u2026 and Nancy Pelosi\u2019s working on it,\u201d Colbert quipped.\n\nColbert also referred to Trump as \u201cthe conspiracy theorist in chief\u201d as he played a clip of him ranting about how he believed that pharmaceutical companies are planting hoaxes to try and bring him down. Colbert urged him not to cause problems with them \u2013 \u201canti-depressants are the only thing getting me through your administration\u201d.\n\nTrevor Noah: \u2018He basically picked Ned Flanders as his VP\u2019\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) Mike Pence has a convenient history of being unaware of Trump\u2019s major scandals \ud83e\udd14 pic.twitter.com/YE3L4SQlCz\n\nOn The Daily Show, Trevor Noah joked that impeachment is \u201cthe \u2018Thank u, next\u2019 of politics\u201d before also bringing up Trump\u2019s confessional.\n\n\u201cThis guy is unbelievable,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s already facing impeachment for asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and now he\u2019s like \u2018You know what, China get in on it.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cTrump might be the only person on Earth who thinks two wrongs make a right.\u201d\n\nNoah also spoke about how Pence is slowly being implicated, listing the various ways that suggest he knows more then he is claiming. \u201cPence was so deep in this thing, I bet Mother would consider this cheating,\u201d he joked.\n\nNoah added: \u201cTrump is Homer Simpson and he basically picked Ned Flanders as his VP.\u201d\n\nPence\u2019s aides have said that he was unaware of anything nefarious going on and Noah then played a montage of Pence claiming he was unaware of every wrong thing Trump has done since he became president. \u201cHe\u2019s like every mom watching a movie,\u201d he said.\n\nNoah continued: \u201cIf that\u2019s true then that\u2019s actually not good for America. Because you realise if Trump gets kicked out then Pence is president but clearly he has no idea what\u2019s going on.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts discussed the impeachment investigation and Trump\u2019s televised Ukraine confession", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/844cb4e89a650c456011f13482a6d981d402a6cf/61_0_1467_880/master/1467.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=68c294ef7527449fd124d7cb5337e875", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
