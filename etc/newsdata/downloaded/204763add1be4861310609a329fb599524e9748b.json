Is this scary story one that happened IRL? Are you about to never leave your house ever again?\n\nWhile we may love to scare the absolute bajeesus out of ourselves on the reg with a horror film (especially at this time of year) do you know the terrifying true stories that lit the spark of inspiration for some of the most blood thirsty and nightmare-inducing flicks?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re about to.\n\nThe classic: Amityville Horror\n\nIt just LOOKS creepy\n\nSo nice they made it twice. And by nice we mean utterly disturbing.\n\nThe two films, first made in 1979 and then again in 2005 (which followed the 1977 book of the same name), were inspired by the true events of George and Kathy Lutz.\n\nThe pair claimed their house in Long Island was haunted by violent and demonic presences that eventually drove them out of their home.\n\nThe place was investigated by Ed and Lorraine Warren (more, much more on them later), with it believed the place was haunted following the DeFeo murders.\n\nHi Ryan (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nOn 13 November, 1974, Ronald DeFeo Jr shot and killed six members of his family at 112 Ocean Avenue, in the suburban neighborhood in Amityville. He was convicted of second-degree murder in November 1975.\n\nIn December 1975, George and Kathy Lutz and their three children moved into the house. After 28 days, the Lutzes left the house, claiming to have been terrorised by paranormal phenomena while living there, with George waking at 3.15am every morning \u2013 the time of the murders.\n\nIn the film, Ryan Reynolds also had a great beard.\n\nThe real house totally still exists by the way.\n\nThe Conjuring Universe\n\nSo much spook (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nPerhaps one of the most famous in western filmmaking, the Conjuring Universe centres on 2013\u2019s The Conjuring, 2015\u2019s The Conjuring 2 and its various shootoffs, like Annabelle Comes Home and The Nun.\n\nThe whole shebang is centred on Ed and Lorraine Warren, a self-proclaimed demonologist and a medium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEd and Lorraine really existed, you know, and here is where the inspiration lies, after they founded the New England Society For Psychic Research back in 1952.\n\nThe first movie centres on the real life story of the Perron family who, after moving into a massive farmhouse in Rhose Island in 1971, began to notice strange occurances including mysterious noises, odd smells and missing objects.\n\nThe real Lorraine Warren (Picture: FilmMagic)\n\nTurns out the house had been in one family for eight generations, with a bunch of members dying in rather suspicious circumstances such as murder and suicide. In the OG film, the spirit Bathsheba was depicted and turns out she was a very real person, a Satanist, apparently, who lived on the Perron property in the 1800s.\n\nWith the Perrons believing Bethsheba was terrorising them, the Warrens visited over a 10-year period and conducted many a s\u00e9ance in which it was believed the family\u2019s mother, Carolyn, was possessed.\n\nNot content with one film, we mean haunted house, the Warrens moved onto the Hodgson family, which formed the basis for the second Conjuring film.\n\nMore possessions, more demonic hauntings, all based on real life events. Fun times.\n\nAnnabelle Comes Home\n\nNope (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nPart of the Conjuring Universe you just got goosebumps reading all about above, Annabelle Comes Home (2019) is an offshoot off that but comes with her own horrifically creepy backstory.\n\nEd and Lorraine Warren investigated the apparently possessed doll of Annabelle before they headed to the Perron house, after, in 1968, two roomates claimed their Raggedy Ann doll was taken over by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle Higgins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple took the doll and placed it in the family\u2019s Occult Museum.\n\nSince then the doll has spawned many films including Annabelle, Annabelle: Creation as well as those in the Conjuring Universe such as Annabelle Comes Home.\n\nVeronica\n\nVeronica has a terrifying real story (Picture: Netflix/veronica)\n\nThe 2017 film, directed by REC mastermind Paco Plaza, tells the story of Veronica (played by Sandra Escacena), who, for some ridiculous reason, uses a ouija board during a solar eclipse and then tries to summon the spirit of a dead friend who died in a motorcycle accident. However, she and her friends accidentally disturb the spirit of Veronica\u2019s dead father and summon a sinister demon.\n\nThe case is known as the \u2018Vallecas case\u2019, which takes the name from the neighbourhood in Madrid where a young girl named Estefania Gutierrez Lazari reportedly performed a seance to summon a classmate who died in a motorcycle accident.\n\nA nun interrupted the fun \u2018ol paranormal activity and broke the ouija board, but after playing the game, Estefania complained to her parents about hallucinations and hearing voices, as well as convulsing. No doctors could figure out what was wrong with her \u2013 and in August 1991, two months after the ouija board incident, Estefania died a \u2018sudden and suspicious death\u2019 in the Gregorio Maranon Hospital.\n\nAfter Estefania\u2019s parents claimed they noticed shadows moving in their house and strange occurances, the police report stated four officers cited seeing doors open in an \u2018unnatural way\u2019, a Jesus separated from his cross, and hearing loud noises come from empty rooms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Exorcist\n\nApparently this actually happened (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nAnother classic, The Exorcist (1973) was claimed to be one of the freakiest movies ever released and decades on we have to say it\u2019s still pretty WTF.\n\nIn the film we see Regan who, after playing with a Ouija board and contacting a supposedly imaginary friend whom she calls Captain Howdy, begins acting strangely, including making mysterious noises, stealing, constantly using obscene language, and exhibiting abnormal strength.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more terrifying is the fact it\u2019s based on the story of a 14-year-old boy, Roland Doe, who was believed to have been demonically possessed in 1949.\n\nRoland\u2019s family reported furniture moving on its own, scratches all over his body, and loud, disembodied voices.\n\nCute, right?\n\nWith seemingly no other move to make, his family enlisted the help of the Catholic Church. Father Raymond Bishop, one of the priests noted in his diary: \u2018At midnight, the Fathers planned to give (Roland) Holy Communion, but Satan would have no part of it. Even while the institution of the Blessed Sacrament was explained, his body was badly scratched and branded. The word HELLO was printed on his chest and thigh.\u2019\n\nIt was latest concluded by paranormal sceptics that Roland was likely a mentally ill teenager acting out.\n\nThe Exorcism of Emily Rose\n\nAgain, everyone loves a film based on a real life exorcism, don\u2019t they?\n\nThis one (released in 2005) was based on the story of Anneliese Michel, who, at the age of 17, was diagnosed with epilepsy, and given medication, after showing symptoms of apparent possession.\n\nStill, she continued to have seizures, claimed she was having visions and hearing voices. Saying she was being told she was a sinner by one of the voices, she was genuflecting, or kneeling, 600 times a day and eventually rupturing her knee ligaments.\n\nAfter undergoing 67 exorcisms in 10 months, she eventually stopped eating and died of starvation in 1976.\n\nHer parents and priests were charged with negligent homicide for allowing her to starve \u2013 which formed the basis of the plot of The Exorcism Of Emily Rose.\n\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre\n\nBased on a real guy, apparently (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nLeatherface, the lead antagonist in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974 and 2003), was based on Ed Gein, a serial killer who was known as the \u2018Butcher of Plainfield\u2019.\n\nNot only Leatherface, he\u2019s also suspected to be the inspiration behind Normal Bates\u2019s Psycho character (owing to his apparent obsession with his mother) and Buffalo Bill in the Silence Of The Lambs.\n\nFun times.\n\nEd Gein inspired many heinous characters (Picture: Getty)\n\nHe is suspected to have killed several victims, and robbed the graves of the recently buried.\n\nUsing the skin of women, he created a suit that he wore supposedly pretending to be his mother (getting the Buffalo Bill vibes yet?), while also constructing lamps, belts and bowls made out of human body parts.\n\nWhen A Stranger Calls\n\nTurning kids off ever becoming babysitters, When A Stranger Calls (films released in both 1979 and 2006) is based on the unsolved murder of 13-year-old Janett Christmas in 1950.\n\nShe was babysitting when she rang the Columbia Police Department and told them to \u2018come quick\u2019 before hanging up.\n\nPolice weren\u2019t able to trace the call, so it wasn\u2019t until Greg Romack\u2019s parents returned they found the babysitter\u2019s body in a pool of blood, having been raped and strangled with a cord.\n\nForming the basis of many a horror story, it was ruled the murder had been an \u2018inside job\u2019 by someone who knew the layout of the house well.\n\nThe Girl Next Door\n\nThe Girl Next Door (2004) tells the horrific story of Meg and her disabled sister Susan, who lost their parents in a car accident and were sent to live with their reclusive aunt, Ruth her sons, Willie, Ralphie, and Donny.\n\nThe tragic story is loosely based on the death of Sylvia Likens, who was found dead at the age of 16 in the basement of her temporary home.\n\nAfter her parents left her and her sister in the care of Gertrude Baniszewski, a mother of seven, she was found dead only three months later.\n\nHer emaciated corpse was found, apparently with hundreds of wounds after she had been tortured to death.\n\nWolf Creek\n\nDid Ivan Milat inspire Mick? (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nThe Australian horror (released in 2005) centres on the abduction and murder of backpackers, who stumble across farmer Mick Taylor.\n\nSoon horrors occur as they\u2019re systematically picked off in a series of gory deaths, including being stabbed, shot and paralysed, seemingly in the name of sport for Mick who, as it is discovered, has a psychopathic collection of cars, cameras and possessions of those he\u2019d killed before.\n\nThe tale is based on a real string of murders that occurred in Australia\u2019s Belanglo State Forest in the 90s by Ivan Milat, AKA \u2018the Backpacker Killer\u2019.\n\nWhile the convicted killer (who died last week in prison) long denied his involvement in the murders of several backpackers, he was convicted for torturing and killing at least seven people. However, it\u2019s believed his body count is much higher.\n\nSome of his victims were killed through seemingly being used as target practice, others had their spinal cord severed and one was decapitated \u2013 her head never being found.\n\nEaten Alive\n\nThe 1976 horror tells the story of Judd, who owns the Starlight Hotel\u2026and a pet crocodile. Mentally-unhinged, he terrorises those who come to stay at his hotel by either feeding them to his crocodile or killing them himself with various objects, such as a scythe.\n\nThe tale is based on that of Joe Ball who owned the Sociable Inn in the early 1900s. He was said to have kept multiple alligators in an enclosure near the saloon and after three ladies went missing, it was believed Joe had murdered them and fed them to his pet alligators.\n\nThere was never any evidence as to this, however when police questioned him in 1938 he shot himself.\n\nAnyway, sleep tight.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
