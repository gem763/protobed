However, as investigations are now carried out by party staff, the power to expel can be restored to the NEC.\n\nA Labour party spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposals to fast-track expulsions in serious cases, the NEC has agreed detailed rule changes, which will be put to a vote at conference.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of Labour members are motivated by equality, justice and fairness. The party has taken decisive and robust disciplinary action following complaints about a small minority of party members. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s reforms, supported by the NEC, would further speed up these processes.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Jewish Labour Movement released a statement saying the proposed reforms were not good enough and criticised the plan to debate them on the Sabbath, which would stop Orthodox members taking part.\n\n\u201cTime and again, the party leadership and the NEC have demonstrated a complete failure in both judgment and commitment to tackle antisemitism. With a statutory investigation by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission well under way, this is the latest example of institutional failing.\n\n\u201cWe have learnt tonight from press reports that the party wishes to make sweeping changes to the disciplinary rules on antisemitism, without consulting us, its only Jewish affiliate, or any communal organisation. To add insult to injury, they will debate these changes at conference on the Jewish Sabbath, when religiously observant Jewish Labour delegates will be silenced, unable to participate in the debate.\n\n\u201cThe Jewish community has zero confidence that proposals to hand the NEC more powers on disciplinary matters will solve this crisis. There have been countless examples of NEC members either engaging in antisemitism or turning a blind eye to it. It will simply streamline the process of letting antisemites off the hook.\u201d\n\nThe row is just one of several controversial decisions to come out of Tuesday\u2019s marathon NEC meeting.\n\nThe body also decided to move to in effect abolish Labour Students, the party\u2019s student wing which is seen as being on the more centrist side of the party, provoking frustration from Labour MPs who said they relied on its volunteers in election campaigns.\n\nThe motion was brought by Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum and an ally of Corbyn. Labour Students is challenging the decision, saying it has paid its fees.\n\nThere is also a controversy over processes to select candidates as MPs. Some in Welsh Labour are unhappy that the NEC decided not to devolve the process for reselections, which will mean the central party retains control.\n\nA decision was also taken for the party to change the process for selections in key seats, which have been paused while the party concentrated on reselections and trigger ballots for sitting MPs.\n\nSome MPs believe there is a move under way to give the central party more control over selections and allow the leadership or trade unions to parachute favoured candidates into key marginal and safe seats vacated by retiring MPs rather than letting local members decide. Firm proposals have not yet been worked up by officials but they will be presented to a future NEC meeting possibly as soon as Friday.", "description": "Jewish Labour Movement also criticises party for allowing issue to be debated at party conference on Jewish Sabbath", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/704d0b8d13c8f14749baad79167989840433e49f/0_0_4635_2781/master/4635.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a9d38aecce4a697034711ffc18e9c999", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
