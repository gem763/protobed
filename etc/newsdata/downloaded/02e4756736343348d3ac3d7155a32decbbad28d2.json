'Both Turkey and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have fought against ISIS,' said James Jeffrey, a U.S. special envoy for Syria. 'If they are not forced to face off against each other, we can rely on both of them against ISIS,' he said. Jeffrey told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he was not consulted by President Donald Trump until after the start of the Turkish offensive in Syria. 'We've done a pretty good job of bringing this attack to a halt,' Jeffrey said. 'Turkey has not really gained all that much from this.' He estimated that the number of Kurdish victims of Turkey's advance was \"in the low hundreds.\" But he said that Turkish-supported Syrian opposition forces 'in at least one instance did carry out a war crime - and we have reached out to Turkey to demand an explanation.'\n\nKurdish fighters in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were key to defeating ISIS in Syria earlier this year.\n\nHowever, Turkey regards many of the Kurdish fighters as terrorists and wants a buffer zone against them on its southern border.\n\nPresident Trump abruptly pulled out U.S. forces earlier this month, clearing the way for the long-planned Turkish offensive.\n\nHis decision has been widely seen as a betrayal and Trump invited ridicule by declaring that the Kurds 'didn't help us with Normandy'.\n\nSince the Turkish offensive began on October 9, at least 114 civilians have been killed and some 300,000 people have been displaced.\n\nVladimir Putin's presidential spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, joined in that criticism today.\n\n'The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds over the past few years. But in the end, the US abandoned the Kurds, actually betraying them,' he said.\n\n'The US opted to abandon the Kurds on the border, almost forcing them to fight against the Turks.'\n\nA former head of the U.S. military made the same point. Retired Admiral Mike Mullen said Erdogan 'would not send those troops across that border if the Americans were there.'\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said the area of the 'safe zone' was calm late on Tuesday.\n\nErdogan had earlier threatened to resume Ankara's military offensive if the Kurds did not withdraw.\n\nThe Turkish operation 'is ending, and everything will depend now on the implementation of these agreements,' Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Vladmir Putin meet in the resort of Sochi for a summit to discuss the future of Syria\n\nAngry Kurds have blocked US troops in the streets as they cross from Syria into Iraq in a display of hostility after Washington pulled the plug on their support\n\nRussian forces moved in last week to support the Syrian army, whose help against Turkey was requested by the Kurds.\n\nMoscow is a key ally of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, who yesterday branded Erdogan a 'thief' for his incursion into Syria.\n\nAssad called the Turkish President a 'thief who robbed factories, wheat and fuel and is today stealing territory', according to state media.\n\nErdogan said last week he was not bothered by the Damascus regime's return.\n\nAnkara has also said that some of the 3.6million Syrian refugees in Turkey can be rehoused inside the safe zone.\n\nYesterday German leader Angela Merkel threw her support behind a proposal for an internationally enforced safe zone, possibly even involving German troops.\n\nMerkel told conservative MPs that the idea was 'very promising, even if there are many questions', sources in the parliamentary party said.\n\n'We cannot just stand by and watch and not do anything,' Berlin's defence minister told German television.\n\nU.S. troops leaving Syria and heading to Iraq yesterday in a withdrawal which has opened the way for a Turkish invasion and thrust Syria back into the international spotlight\n\nBut Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer's plan has already met with resistance from Merkel's coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD).\n\nIn addition, the use of military force remains a highly sensitive subject in Germany because of the legacy of World War II.\n\nThe U.S. has indicated that some of its withdrawn troops may stay in western Iraq to continue the fight against ISIS.\n\nBut Iraq appeared to throw those plans into disarray yesterday by saying the Americans had no permission to stay there.\n\nAngry Kurds have blocked U.S. troops in the streets as they cross from Syria into Iraq after Washington pulled the plug on their support.\n\nAmerican troops were even pelted with potatoes as they passed through a Syrian town on their way to Iraq on Monday.\n\nThe Pentagon is now considering keeping a small U.S. force in north-eastern Syria to protect oilfields.\n\nThe United States currently has 5,200 troops posted in Iraq, deployed as part of a Washington-led coalition against the ISIS jihadists.\n\nThe U.S. presence at several bases across Iraq is already controversial, with numerous political groups and pro-Iran Shiite armed groups demanding their expulsion.", "description": "WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT - Patients were seen with horrific burns on their faces and bodies while a distressed young girl was carried with a badly injured leg after the  blast in Ras al-Ain.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/10/20076080-0-image-a-2_1571822887557.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
