Trump, leaving no doubt that the Kremlin would like to see the incumbent re-elected.\n\nMutual affinity between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is undeniable, as gushing adoration dispensed by the U.S. president is received by the Kremlin\u2019s perennial occupant with a wily snicker.\n\nThe Kremlin openly enjoys the chaos of Trump\u2019s tumultuous presidency, accompanied by the Republican Party\u2019s abdication of American values, as the GOP continues to block stronger election security measures.\n\n\u201c Putin\u2019s government has a strong preference for the populists who reject the establishment and promote the agenda of inward-looking America. \u201d\n\nBut it would be a mistake to assume that the Kremlin\u2019s sympathies are reserved solely for the Republicans. When it comes to elections, all Americans are Putin\u2019s foes and those who can best divide them are the Kremlin\u2019s hand picked favorites. Putin\u2019s government has a strong preference for the populists who reject the establishment and promote the agenda of inward-looking America. The Kremlin\u2019s ultimate goal is the retreat of the United States from global affairs, which would allow the rest of the world to be quietly devoured by despots.\n\nIn covering Democratic debates, Russian state media elucidated the Kremlin\u2019s preferences. The title of one segment echoed Trump\u2019s words: \u201cThey won\u2019t make America great.\u201d And the hardest hit were the Russians\u2019 least favorite candidates: Former Vice President Joe Biden and California Senator Kamala Harris. The Kremlin\u2019s talking heads mocked Biden as an \u201celderly candidate,\u201d with a petty, painstaking accounting of his minor slip-ups. Russian state media snickered about Kamala Harris \u201chaving her dirty deeds exposed in front of the audience of millions.\u201d\n\nClashing with these unflattering descriptions was the upbeat coverage of Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. In spite of the fact he\u2019s older than Joe Biden, Sanders faced no criticism for his age. The Russian media portrayed Sanders as the frontrunner of the earlier Democratic debate night, allegedly deemed to be \u201cmore impressive\u201d by The Washington Post. (The article in question did not contain such a description.) Russian state TV gushed about its second Democrat darling: \u201cTulsi Gabbard became the most popular candidate in Google searches.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s ongoing support for Gabbard is not surprising, since her talking points are in perfect alignment with the Kremlin and its allies, including even and especially the Assad regime in Syria. During Wednesday\u2019s debate, Gabbard dramatically proclaimed: \u201cWe were all lied to\u201d [by the U.S. government] in perfect synchrony with Russia\u2019s constant assertions that the United States cannot be trusted. RT (formerly Russia Today) previously stated that, \u201cTulsi Gabbard\u2019s emergence fills a glaring lacuna in a political culture in Washington chronically afflicted with the moral and rabid sickness of an empire that has entered its mad dog days.\u201d\n\nSince 2016, RT\u2019s pundits have opined that Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s \u201cideology is basically made up\u201d and pondered whether she would abandon the Democratic Party and \u201cgo from Bernie Sanders to Donald Trump\u201d in order to secure a position within his administration.\n\nRussian state media is currently preoccupied with the notion Gabbard was left off Twitter\u2019s list of top trending topics intentionally. Russia\u2019s efforts to promote Gabbard\u2019s candidacy dovetail with the coverage by Fox News, which describes her as \u201cthe Democrat who stood out at debates among a pack of radical progressives.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Russia\u2019s support for Bernie Sanders is not a new phenomenon. During 2017 hearings in Russia\u2019s Federation Council, RT\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan admitted that the network spent the largest amount of money to promote Twitter content related to Bernie Sanders\u2014not Donald Trump. RT interviewed Bernie Sanders several times, \u201cbecause he was the only candidate who would agree to it.\u201d\n\nRussian analysts surmise that Sanders is too radical for most voters, ultimately pushing them away and causing a fraction of Democrats to vote for Trump. Russian state media analysts predict that the events of 2016 could largely be repeated in the 2020 elections: \u201cAt the time, Sanders and Hillary Clinton were spending energy on each other, which led to a split in the Democratic Party and Trump\u2019s victory. Today the situation is even worse, since two dozen candidates struggle to divide the electorate among themselves and continue to take away their votes from the party\u2019s primaries.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s support of Sanders and Gabbard is a continuation of the 2016 strategy that aims to use their candidacies as propaganda fodder\u2014but more importantly, strives to re-elect Donald Trump.\n\n\u201c RT predicts that 'the liberal-globalist world order' is coming to an end, to be replaced by a fundamentally different system, 'which will be discussed in the next three to four years by Putin, Trump and Xi Jinping' \u201d\n\nOne more example of the reason Trump is Putin\u2019s pick was on display this week with Trump\u2019s offer to help Russia contain the Siberian wildfires in a phone call initially publicized by Putin, not the American president.\n\nIt was taken as a promise of normalizing the relations\u2014without any concessions from the Kremlin. In stark contrast with the previous U.S. administrations, the American president did not address human rights violations and the increasing brutality with which the Kremlin is suppressing local protests. During his call with the Russian leader, Trump admittedly failed to bring up the issue of election interference, having consistently misrepresented it as a joke\u2014in spite of the damning findings by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nNotably, the American president\u2019s offer to help fight Russian wildfires is in sharp contrast with his reaction to the natural disasters taking place in the United States. Trump notoriously blamed California\u2019s forest management for the state's wildfires and chastised Congress for \u201cfoolishly\" sending excessive amounts of disaster relief funds to Puerto Rico. Trump\u2019s description of the USSR as merely Russia by another name, \u201cwhen it was all together,\u201d undoubtedly thrilled Putin\u2019s revanchist heart. The stream of outlandish statements made by President Trump overrides Russia\u2019s traditional methods of manufacturing disinformation, since the reality is truly stranger than fiction and the Russian headlines seem to be writing themselves.\n\nRT predicts that \u201cthe liberal-globalist world order\u201d is coming to an end, to be replaced by a fundamentally different system, \u201cwhich will be discussed in the next three to four years by Putin, Trump and Xi [Jinping]\u201d\u2014 unless Trump is replaced by someone like Biden, Sanders, Harris or Warren. According to the Kremlin-sponsored media, the chances of that happening are slim to none and \u201cDonald is doing just fine.\u201d", "description": "The Kremlin\u2019s Democratic darlings are Tulsi Gabbard and Bernie Sanders.
