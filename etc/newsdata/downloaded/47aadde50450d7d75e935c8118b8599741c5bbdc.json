A case in point is his decision last year to move the government headquarters into a luxurious skyscraper in La Paz.\n\nWhile still among the poorest countries in Latin America, Bolivia's poverty rate has decreased from 45 percent of the population in 2010 to 35 percent in 2018, according to the World Bank.\n\nEnvironmentalists blame him for raging wildfires that destroyed more than four million hectares (10 million acres) of forest and grassland, saying legislation enacted under Morales encouraged wholesale deforestation in order to expand agricultural production.\n\nIt's all a long way from his childhood herding llamas and helping his parents in the fields in a small, arid village in western Bolivia's Oruro department.\n\n\"Until I was 14, I had no idea there was such a thing as underwear. I slept in my clothes... (which) my mother only removed for two reasons: to look for lice or to patch an elbow or a knee,\" he wrote in a candid autobiography.\n\nFour of his six brothers and sisters died of malnutrition and disease before the age of two.\n\n- Referendum defeat -\n\nMorales never went to college and has considerable difficulty reading speeches in public, preferring to improvise by repeating phrases about the economic strides made under his government.\n\nMorales has been re-elected twice before with large majorities. His only defeat at the polls came in a 2016 referendum when he tried to amend Bolivia's constitution to run for a fourth time.\n\nRefusing to accept defeat, he petitioned the country's highest court, which analysts say is packed with his allies and which backed his right to run again.\n\nThe move led to protests and allegations of corruption from the opposition, whose candidate, former president Carlos Mesa, provided Morales with his stiffest electoral test yet.\n\nMorales has urged the electorate to give him \"five more years to complete our great projects\" and continue to expand one of Latin America's fastest growing economies.\n\nUnder Morales, Bolivia has increased foreign investment, particularly from China, to help it exploit its rich natural resources and is on track to become the world's fourth largest producer of lithium by 2021.\n\nA fierce critic of the United States, Morales is a staunch ally of leftist governments in Cuba and Venezuela.", "description": "Evo Morales, Latin America's longest-serving president who Thursday claimed a fourth term as Bolivia's president, is the country's first indigenous head of state.
