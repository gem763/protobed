The intelligence community\u2019s inspector general deemed the complaint an urgent matter, and the Democratic chairman of the committee, Adam Schiff, has accused Mr. Maguire of illegally preventing the complaint from being shared with lawmakers in order to protect the Trump administration.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What would you like to learn from the acting director of National Intelligence when he testifies next week? Join the conversation below.\n\nMichael Atkinson, the Trump-appointed inspector general, met Thursday morning with the committee in a closed-session. Mr. Atkinson declined to tell lawmakers the substance of the complaint or if it involves the president, but did say it involves more than one episode and is based on a series of events, according to multiple people who attended or were briefed on the meeting.\n\nMr. Trump disputed that he had said anything inappropriate in a call with a foreign leader.\n\n\u201cVirtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!\u201d he tweeted on Thursday. \u201cKnowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u201cheavily populated\u201d call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\u201d\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the whistleblower complaint.\n\nJoseph Maguire in 2018, before his eventual selection as acting director of national intelligence.

Rather, the complaint presented legal questions about whether it fell within the office\u2019s jurisdiction and how to handle involvement of potentially privileged information that required consultation with other parts of the executive branch.\n\nThe substance of the complaint was previously reported by the Washington Post.\n\nAfter the committee\u2019s briefing by Mr. Atkinson, which lasted for roughly four hours, furious Democrats said the Justice Department and possibly Attorney General William Barr were keeping Congress from learning the contents of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\n\u201cWe do know that the Department of Justice has been involved in the decision to withhold that information from Congress,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cWe do not know\u2014because we cannot get an answer to the question\u2014about whether the White House is also involved in preventing this information from coming to Congress.\u201d\n\nOn advice from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence determined that the allegation didn\u2019t meet the statutory definition of an \u201curgent concern\u201d requiring reporting to the intelligence committees. A department spokeswoman confirmed that the guidance came from the office, which offers advice to the executive branch, but didn\u2019t say whether Mr. Barr was involved in the discussions.\n\nMr. Schiff issued a subpoena last week to Mr. Maguire over the complaint while suggesting the issues divulged by the complainant were being withheld to protect Mr. Trump or other administration officials.\n\nMr. Maguire initially appeared to rebuff the subpoena, but Mr. Schiff said late Wednesday he had agreed to testify at an open hearing next week.\n\nLittle is known about the person who made the complaint. Andrew Bakaj, a former intelligence and Pentagon official who runs a legal practice focused on whistleblower and security clearance issues, confirmed in an email he represents the complainant but declined to comment further.\n\nMr. Atkinson\u2019s urgency in dealing with the complaint, which his office received Aug. 12, was undercut by a determination by the office\u2019s general counsel that the complaint concerned conduct by someone outside the intelligence community, and so didn\u2019t rise to the level of an \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Atkinson \u201cdetermined that this complaint is both credible and urgent, and that it should be transmitted to Congress under the clear letter of the law,\u201d Mr. Schiff said Wednesday.\n\nMr. Schiff on Thursday released letters written by Mr. Atkinson that expressed a forceful disagreement with the Justice Department\u2019s factual analysis of the matter, which he said clearly involved an \u201cintelligence activity\u201d and required disclosure to Congress.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee is also expected to be briefed by Messrs. Maguire and Atkinson next week and is working on finding the \u201cappropriate forum\u201d for the complaint, a committee spokeswoman said.\n\n\u201cThere is a very specific process in place for IC whistleblower complaints because they deal with classified and sensitive information,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there\u2019s genuine uncertainty about where a complaint falls in that process, we have to address it. But it should never be negotiated in the media.\u201d\n\nFormer national security officials said it was extremely unlikely that details of a president\u2019s conversation would have circulated as a result of U.S. intelligence agencies listening to a direct phone call between the president and a world leader. Other more plausible scenarios could have prompted the whistleblower complaint, they said.\n\n\u201cIf the president was accidentally picked up on a phone call, [U.S. intelligence analysts] would throw the headphones down immediately and purge the transcript,\u201d a former senior intelligence official said.\n\nWhite House National Security Council staff typically listen to presidential calls with other heads of state and maintain transcripts and contemporaneous handwritten notes, which are tightly controlled but usually disseminated to relevant cabinet secretaries and other senior personnel, former officials said.\n\nDue to previous leaks of his calls with foreign leaders, the Trump White House has sought to limit access to such memorandums.\n\nStill, former officials pointed to those types of files as the likely source of the substance on which the complaint originated. \u201cIt could be that the whistleblower was on the receiving end of that transcript, or it was passed on into their possession,\u201d said Ned Price, a former NSC official during the Obama administration.\n\nMr. Trump had a number of conversations with foreign leaders in the weeks leading up to the filing of the complaint, including a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 31.\n\nMr. Trump also received letters from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over the summer and held meetings with the leaders of Pakistan, Qatar and the Netherlands.\n\nMr. Trump traveled to Japan in June for the Group of 20 summit, where he met with world leaders including Mr. Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. During the trip he had an impromptu meeting with Mr. Kim at the border between North Korea and South Korea.\n\n\u2014Sadie Gurman\n\nand Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Dustin Volz at dustin.volz@wsj.com and Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com", "description": "A whistleblower complaint that has prompted a standoff between the U.S. intelligence community and Democrats in Congress involves President Trump\u2019s communications with a foreign leader.", "authors": ["Dustin Volz", "Siobhan Hughes", "Dustin.Volz Wsj.Com", "Siobhan.Hughes Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108689/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
