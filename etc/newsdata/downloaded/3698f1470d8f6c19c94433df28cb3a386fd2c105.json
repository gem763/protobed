The Army\u2019s AI Task Force, created earlier this year as part of the Defense Department\u2019s broader effort to turn what was once science fiction into reality, has brought together military officials and academic leaders at Carnegie Mellon University, an institution considered to be the birthplace of AI research.\n\nTucked in a spot more than two miles off the main campus that is unlikely to be found unless one knew where to look, the school\u2019s National Robotics Engineering Center serves as the epicenter of a partnership between the Army and academia. On the center\u2019s sprawling warehouse floor, prototypes of military vehicles, robots, self-driving cars and a host of other gadgets undergo constant testing and tweaking.\n\nBeyond the mind-blowing experimentation and next-level research, Army leaders keep an eye on the bigger picture. The nation\u2019s security, they say, requires keeping a step ahead of adversaries in the rapidly evolving world of AI.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a national imperative,\u201d Col. Doug Matty, deputy director of the Army\u2019s AI Task Force, told The Washington Times in an exclusive interview. The Times was granted access to the facility this week, though many of the projects on display involve sensitive or proprietary research and cannot be publicly revealed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still coming to grips with the power that advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, can provide,\u201d Col. Matty said. \u201cWe know there are orders of magnitude of improvement that are available when you solve the right problem with the right technology.\u201d\n\nNext great challenge\n\nThe Army task force is just one example of how the Pentagon views AI as a central piece of America\u2019s national defense \u2014 at a time when many private analysts are warning Russia and especially China have opened a significant lead in many fields of research.\n\nThe Defense Department\u2019s recent AI strategy declared that the technology \u201cis expected to impact every corner of the department, spanning operations, training, sustainment, force protection, recruiting, health care and many others.\u201d\n\nInside the Pentagon, the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) coordinates efforts across the military branches \u2014 including the Army \u2014 in pursuit of a seamless strategy with one simple goal: to be the world\u2019s leader in AI.\n\nReminiscent of the Manhattan Project or the Apollo space program, the AI all-hands push requires that the military work closely with outside partners and attract the brightest minds in the nation.\n\n\u201cIf we do not find a way to strengthen the bonds between the United States government and industry and academia, then I would say we do have the real risk of not moving as fast as China when it comes to\u201d artificial intelligence, JAIC Director Lt. Gen. Jack Shanahan told reporters during a recent briefing at the Pentagon.\n\nIt\u2019s clear, administration officials and analysts say, that America\u2019s chief rivals have similar goals. China is aggressively researching AI and has committed billions of dollars to an effort to revamp its own military for next-generation fights.\n\nIn a speech late last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping said Beijing must improve its AI capabilities so the nation is not reliant on military hardware and software from other nations.\n\nChina will \u201censure that our country marches in the front ranks where it comes to theoretical research in this important area of AI, and occupies the high ground in critical and AI core technologies,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia also is pursuing a comprehensive AI strategy to aid its military, academic institutions, health care system, and other areas of its society. Much like the U.S., Moscow\u2019s approach relies heavily on ramping up cooperation and coordination between the military, academic and private sectors.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is now reportedly reviewing a draft of the nation\u2019s AI strategy and may soon announce massive new investments into the technology.\n\nThe right partner\n\nFor the U.S., military officials say finding the right partner in the quest for AI dominance was crucial. Leaders at Carnegie Mellon say their campus \u2014 and the school\u2019s decades-long reputation as a hub of AI research \u2014 provide a unique environment and a top-of-the-line facility that\u2019s already equipped with hundreds of millions of dollars in equipment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons the Army is here,\u201d Joshua Cauvel, technical program manager at the school\u2019s Robotics Institute, told The Times.\n\nIndeed, Army leaders say their AI team was given an ambitious mission with little time to waste. Building facilities from scratch wasn\u2019t an option.\n\n\u201cThe hypothesis was, \u2018Can you turn your timeline from years to months?\u2019\u201d Col. Matty said. \u201cAnd what we\u2019re seeing is with the right resources, with the right technical support, with the infrastructure you have to have and the leadership support, \u2026 you can change months, weeks, to even days in terms of progress. And you see it right in front of you.\u201d\n\nFor example, the Army AI Task Force says that fully automated medical evacuation aircraft could be deployed in as little as five years. Such a revolutionary change would not only take rescue pilots out of harm\u2019s way, but would also free up the men and women traditionally tasked with evacuation to perform other missions.\n\nBeyond the exciting battlefield capabilities, officials also point to less glamorous benefits AI can provide. The Army task force is rethinking its \u201ctalent management\u201d strategy to better incorporate technology, with AI algorithms under construction that will better analyze a soldier\u2019s education and experience when it comes to making assignments.\n\nThe idea, officials say, is to use AI to dig deeper and find information that could be missed on a resume or even in face-to-face conversations.\n\nThat project and others, Col. Matty said, is an example of how the Army isn\u2019t simply eyeing new technology as it comes online and then figuring out what to do with it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to solve the maze backwards,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is starting at the finish.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
