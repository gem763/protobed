Despite her esteemed career, one man on social media decided to focus on her wardrobe decisions and told her that her high-waisted pants were \"foolish.\"\n\n\"Just wanted to let you know that the clothes you've been wearing, especially those crazy pants that ride half way up your torso, are not cool looking, in any way,\" a man, identified only as Jeffery, messaged Vespa on her professional Facebook account on Thursday. \"They look rediculous [sic] on you. Please change your wardrobe, you're way too pretty to look so foolish.\"\n\nThen, while Vespa was live on air on Friday, Jefferey sent her a follow-up message: \u201cOMG you really looked uncomfortably [sic] tonight. Try dressing like a normal woman. Doesn\u2019t KGW pay you enough for a wardrobe makeover?\u201d\n\nIn response, Vespa wore five different high-waisted pants during separate newscasts throughout the weekend; meanwhile, a conversation regarding the policing of female bodies started to brew on Vespa's Facebook page.\n\nOn Sunday, Vespa addressed the man\u2019s comments on-air.\n\n\u201cThis is dumb,\" Vespa said of Jeffery\u2019s message. \"We know that. These are my pants. I like them. I bought them.\"\n\n\"The thing is, I posted about this on social media and it really hit a nerve with people. Hundreds are sounding off about the pressure that women obviously face, especially those in the public eye, to embody the epitome the body of physical attractiveness at all times,\" Vespa continued. \"If we don't, it's somehow seen as a sign that we're less credible, or less capable, and by and large, guys don't have to deal with this, as my awesome male coworkers can and have attested to.\"\n\nCommenters agreed with Vespa regarding this inequity.\n\nErika Thomas, an evening anchor with 5NEWS, commented, \u201cI\u2019m am evening anchor who\u2019s not a size 2 and have been criticized for my weight many times... just last week, I got a lovely email telling me that a chiffon blouse and black slacks (when 99% of the time I wear dresses) were \u2018unprofessional\u2019 and I should dress differently if I wanted to be \u2018taken seriously.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for posting this! The pressure that society puts on girls and women is ridiculous and harmful,\u201d another commenter wrote.\n\n\u201cPREACH! This is fantastic Maggie. It really bothers me hearing people harassing hard working journalists for what they wear,\u201d Scott Perry, a photographer for KATU News, wrote. \u201cI see it so much in this business. I hope one day people will eventually stop.\u201d\n\nVespa's mother, who worked at as a news anchor in Peroria, Ill., also sympathized with her plight.\n\n\u201cShe talked about getting horrible, toxic comments from people and unbelievably sexist things that make [Jeffery\u2019s comments] look pale in comparison,\u201d Vespa told the Washington Post.\n\n\"Our goal here is to send a message, to women, to girls, to everyone. Dress how you want, look how you want,\" Vespa said on-air. \"And if anyone tries to make you feel less than because of that, that's their problem, not yours. In other words, there is no one way for a normal woman to look or be. Ten years ago I would have needed someone to remind me of that, now I'm very comfortable to let it roll off my back while I wear my high-waisted pants.\"\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A nine-year veteran of broadcast journalism struck back at a viewer after he offered her some nasty, unsolicited fashion advice.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nAXWUzCDaYfOQt_ERWGm6w--~B/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-us/video/video.insideeditioncbs.com/dea349d68b97c5fdaeb132209ad50d9d", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
