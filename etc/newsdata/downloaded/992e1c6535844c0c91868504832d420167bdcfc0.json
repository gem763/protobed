But Is Everyone a Writer?", "language": "en", "text": "In early 2018, she introduced the first of her weekend-long, application-only s essions. For $1,200 per person, groups of about eight spend Saturday and Sunday at her Manhattan apartment, in Washington Heights \u2014 or, on one occasion, for $1,800, in a borrowed house in Los Angeles \u2014 for a course in first-person essays or memoir, with a focus on idea creation, writing, editing, rewriting and pitching. ( The New York program used to cost $1,600 and included a chef-cooked dinner. Also, smaller groups pay slightly less because with fewer students, more time is spent writing during the workshop itself.)\n\nMs. Daum invites guest speakers and provides a catered lunch.\n\n\u201cI tell my students, \u2018We are going to come to this work as if I am your editor, and as if it was 15 years ago when an editor would actually talk to you on the phone or even take you out to lunch,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nEmily J. Smith, 3 7, was working as a product manager for tech companies when she signed up. She dreamed of a career in writing but couldn\u2019t quit her tech day jobs to enroll in a pricey master of fine arts program.\n\nWhen she heard from a friend about Ms. Daum\u2019s workshop, she applied immediately. \u201cI write essays, personal essays, that try to emulate her style,\u201d Ms. Smith said, \u201cso getting her feedback on my work was an incredible opportunity and I also wanted to meet her and get to know her.\u201d\n\nHer work with Ms. Daum, as well as in workshops led by another writer, Chloe Caldwell, helped Ms. Smith learn to write essays about relationships, power and the culture of online dating, like those she has published in the Rumpus and Medium.\n\nMs. Smith now has a literary agent and is including in a book proposal an essay she worked on with Ms. Daum in the seminar. Ms. Smith also created a dating app meant to combat the loneliness of online dating that her essays describe. Called Chorus, it will allow a dater\u2019s friends to help play matchmaker.", "description": "Workshops hosted by published authors like Elizabeth Gilbert and nonauthors like Caroline Calloway have commodified creativity.", "authors": ["Katherine Rosman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/19/fashion/18WRITERWORKSHOP4/18WRITERWORKSHOP4-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
