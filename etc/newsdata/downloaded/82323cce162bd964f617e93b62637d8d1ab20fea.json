(Image: Dan Howley) More\n\nWhile the changes are incremental, they are welcome improvements. And if you've got an older model or are looking to buy your first Apple Watch, they could entice you to grab a Series 5.\n\nAlways-on display\n\nWith the addition of an always-on display to the Apple Watch Series 5, your watch will now permanently display the time without your raising your wrist or tapping the screen.\n\nNovel-ish?\n\nOkay, yes, mechanical watches have always done this, but it\u2019s a feat for smartwatches. The additional battery drain from the screen always running can significantly cut back on usage time for smartwatches, which is why Apple hasn't offered an always-on display until now.\n\nCompeting smartwatches also have always-on displays, but they have drawbacks. The Fitbit Versa 2's always-on display changes the watch face to a simple digital read-out rather than lowering the brightness of the existing face you're using. Samsung's always-on display functions similarly to Apple's in that it lowers the display's brightness. But the feature isn't on by default, and will drastically cut into the watch's battery life.\n\nFor the Series 5, Apple says it added the always-on display feature without having to also sacrifice the watch's battery thanks to a new screen technology and improved power management. In fact, the company says the Apple Watch Series 5 gets the same 18 hours of battery life as the Series 4, which doesn't have an always-on display.\n\nIn practice, the watch's always-on mode doesn't look all that different from the normal mode. For the most part, the watch faces simply dim and you lose the second hand. Animated faces like those from Disney's \"Toy Story\" or the Liquid Metal and Motion faces dim to a standard digital readout, though those are the exception to the rule.\n\nWhile complications, like the date, weather, and activity tracking, are always visible on the display, notifications aren't.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 5's always-on display lowers the screen's brightness and removes the second hand, saving battery life. (Image: Dan Howley) More\n\nApple said this was a purposeful decision, as having notifications appear on the always-on display would mean someone sitting next to you could see your texts. You can also set it so sensitive notifications like your mail messages and heart rate are hidden.\n\nThe always-on display feature only applies to the watch's face and the Workout app. When used then, you'll still be able to see all of your important workout information, but hundredths of a second on the timer will be hidden until you raise your wrist.", "description": "The Apple Watch Series 5 brings an always-on display and incremental updates that make it an excellent option for newcomers, and those with older Watch models.", "authors": ["Daniel Howley", "Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nK_8Uf7pR7xHsBzB2.0caw--~B/aD03NDM7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/67ae4090-de4a-11e9-bd78-7a317e8938cf", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
