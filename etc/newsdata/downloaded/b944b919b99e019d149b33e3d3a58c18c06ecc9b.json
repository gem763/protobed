The company suspended them on the heels of an FBI investigation. Then, uBiome filed for bankruptcy and said it would focus on its last remaining test, a consumer product called Explorer.\n\nuBiome once convinced Silicon Valley that testing poop was a $600 million business. The company focuses on the diverse community of bacteria in our bodies known as the microbiome.\n\nuBiome's valuation depended heavily on the idea that its products could be considered health tools and used to guide medical decisions. Its last remaining test, the Explorer, is instead pitched as a fun way to get a better understanding of what's going on in your gut, but uBiome says it shouldn't be used to make medical decisions.\n\nRead more: uBiome convinced Silicon Valley that testing poop was worth $600 million. Then the FBI came knocking. Here's the inside story.\n\nA spokesperson from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which governs laboratories, and a spokesperson from uBiome each confirmed to Business Insider that the company no longer maintained the certificate.\n\nuBiome continues to display the certificate for the program, known as CLIA, on its website. The CLIA rules stand for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and are designed to ensure that laboratories meet standards of cleanliness and reliability appropriate for healthcare.\n\nThe uBiome spokesperson said uBiome's CLIA license was removed automatically after uBiome suspended sales of its clinical tests, and added that the company would also be automatically withdrawn from its other lab-certificate program, which is with the College of American Pathologists, or CAP.\n\nThe spokesperson said uBiome planned to remove both icons from its website this week.\n\nMounting challenges for a startup that once convinced Silicon Valley that testing poop was a $600 million business\n\nuBiome has faced a rocky and challenging few months, kicked off by an FBI raid that was related to its billing practices, according to The Wall Street Journal. As that probe has continued, uBiome has lost all of its top executives, laid off half of its staff, and faced serious questions about the scientific validity of its products.\n\nMost recently, the company filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThis latest setback suggests that things are continuing to get worse for uBiome. Out of an initial offering of three products, the company has only one remaining.\n\nAll three products, however, were built on a scientific dataset that insiders previously told Business Insider was flawed.\n\nThat dataset was used as a reference for all the health insights that uBiome provided. It was meant to reflect a healthy adult's microbiome. But it contained data gleaned from poop samples that were taken from 45 minors and at least one nonhuman, company representatives confirmed to Business Insider in August.\n\nRead more: uBiome insiders say key science at the buzzy startup was flawed from the start. Now, the company and a top science journal are investigating.\n\nOutside experts told Business Insider there were other problems with uBiome's tests as well. For example, one-time poop samples like the kind uBiome analyzed simply are not comprehensive enough to provide people with real health insights, they said.\n\nPlus, the patient history that uBiome collected was based on the honor system, meaning some people in uBiome's dataset that were assumed to be healthy may have, in fact, been sick. That could throw off uBiome's analysis and render its insights less meaningful, the experts said.", "description": "uBiome suspended sales of its clinical products on the heels of an FBI probe.
