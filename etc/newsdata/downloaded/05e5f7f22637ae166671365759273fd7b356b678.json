The attacks continued and eight minutes later the first wounded soldiers were reported.\n\nAccording to President L\u00f3pez Obrador, the commander of the military unit responsible of leading the raid was offered $3 million pesos, or $157,00, to let Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez walk free.\n\nBut when he declined their proposition, the cartel threatened to kill him and his family.\n\nTowards the end of the video, Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez begs his brother: 'Please tell them to stop. Relax. Tell them to retreat. But just tell them. I don't want there to be any more chaos, please.'\n\nLater that afternoon, police withdrew from the residence having released Guzm\u00e1n in exchange for a ceasefire.\n\nThirteen people were killed in the bloodshed.\n\nPresident Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (left) defended the decision to release Guzm\u00e1n (right), saying he was protecting civilian lives\n\nCartel leader Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n ordered an all-out attack on the Mexican military after they surrounded his brother's house\n\nA Mexican soldier records the moment Guzm\u00e1n instructs his brother Archivaldo to stop attacking security forces\n\nA cartel member carrying a grenade launcher to fight the army in Culiac\u00e1n on October 17 after violence erupted over the attempted arrest of El Chapo's son\n\nA body is seen laying on the street after the deadly gun battle.
