That's a lot of money,' the mother-of-one said.\n\n\u2018My money, pretty much at the moment covers nursery costs and then what Roland earns, that pretty much goes to anything else on top,' she explained.\n\nSavvy Tracy and Roland learned to work with their tight budget, but the same cannot be said of Simona.\n\n'I try to have some kind of budget in my head but I never stick to it,' she admitted to the couple. 'If I find something I truly love and it costs way too much, I still have to have it.'\n\nOn a normal holiday, Simona (pictured during the low-budget holiday) would be relaxing on a beach with a glass of wine, and would be heading out to a club or a bar for the evening\n\nTasked with the challenge to find an activity and buy dinner with only \u00a320 in her pocket, Simona (pictured with Tracey) struggled to cope\n\nShe then told Tracy and Roland that she\u2019d spend an unlimited amount on bags, with her most expensive buy costing \u00a315,000.\n\nTasked with the challenge to find an activity and buy dinner with only \u00a320 in her pocket, Simona struggled to cope.\n\n'Twenty pounds as a budget I think will really open her eyes,' hopeful Tracey said. 'She might struggle with it but I hope when she does she'll come to appreciate what we have to do on a day to day basis.'\n\nBut Simona was of another opinion, and decided not to rise to the challenge, handing the camera crew the twenty pounds note.\n\n'I have no idea how much things cost, I don\u2019t look at the prices,' she said. 'You don't have to be a billionaire to know that this is s***,' she said, digging in to a plate of fish and chips.\n\nSimona (pictured) was of another opinion, and decided not to rise to the challenge, handing the camera crew the twenty pounds note\n\nBut eventually, the heiress (pictured) had a change of heart, and put together a plan to find an activity for the family\n\nBut, after her meal, the heiress had a change of heart, and put together a plan to find an activity for the family.\n\nShe found a mini-golf Tracey, Roland and Bailey could enjoy together, but decided to opt out and go back to the caravan instead of accompanying them.\n\nThe couple seemed disappointed to see the young woman snub golf in favour of warming up in the caravan.\n\n'It is a shame that she's not joining us,' Tracy said, 'It's kinda made me feel a little bit flat, because I was quite looking forward to having a bit of a giggle with her.'\n\nThe wealthy heiress told the family she would rather not eat than not being able to afford something she'd like to buy.\n\n'For me it's so important, so I would actually rather not eat,' she said.\n\nIn spite of their differences, the family and Simona parted on good terms, with Roland and Tracy inviting the heiress to come another holiday with them.\n\nRich Kids, Skint Holiday airs on Mondays at 9pm on 5Star.", "description": "Simona, a Lithuanian heiress living off her parents' investments in Knightsbridge, went on holiday with Tracy and Roland Sanders-Wainwright on last night's Rich Kids, Skint Holiday.", "authors": ["Claire Toureille For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/12/20032352-0-image-a-4_1571743656406.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
