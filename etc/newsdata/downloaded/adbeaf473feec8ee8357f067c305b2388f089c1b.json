(Stock image)\n\nSteve Webb replies: I was very sorry to read about your recent diagnosis.\n\nWith regard to the National Insurance system, the way in which the system works is that this year\u2019s contributions paid by workers are used to pay this year\u2019s retirement pensions and other NI benefits (plus a small amount that goes towards the NHS).\n\nThis means that there isn\u2019t a literal pot of money with your name on it that would be available to your family if you did not reach state pension age.\n\nHowever, there are a few ways in which you or your family members might get something back from the state system.\n\nFirst, there are certain benefits which you may be able to claim as someone who has had a diagnosis of terminal illness, particularly if your life expectancy is relatively short.\n\nSteve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below\n\nThese are not dependent on your record of NI contributions, but they would at least mean you were getting some money \u2018out of the system\u2019 having put so much in.\n\nYou still have to satisfy certain conditions but you should find that your claim is processed more quickly and you have to jump through fewer hurdles.\n\nThe charity Marie Curie has provided a helpful guide to benefits for people who are terminally ill here.\n\nSecond, in terms of the National Insurance system, if you were to die before pension age and if you have a spouse or civil partner under pension age, they would be able to claim a \u2018Bereavement Support Payment\u2019.\n\nThis is a lump sum (which can help with things like funeral costs) and a monthly payment which runs for 18 months.\n\nThe standard rate is currently a lump sum of \u00a32,500 and a monthly payment of \u00a3100. A higher rate is payable to those who have dependent children.\n\nFinally, if your state pension forecast shows that you were set to receive an amount in excess of the full flat rate (currently \u00a3168.60), then half of any excess can potentially be inherited by a surviving spouse when they reach state pension age.\n\nI appreciate that your question was primarily about your state pension rights, but it is worth saying that if you are a member of an occupational pension scheme, they may well have special rules for those who are terminally ill.\n\nFor example, if you have not reached the normal pension age for the scheme, they may still allow you to draw a pension immediately and without any reduction, though this will depend on the rules of the individual scheme.\n\nI hope that this is helpful and wish you and your family well.", "description": "I worked full time until I had to take ill health retirement, just over a year ago, so I paid enough contributions to get a full state pension.
