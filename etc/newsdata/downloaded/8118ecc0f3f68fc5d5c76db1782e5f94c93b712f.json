His defense is anything but, as allies like Rudy Giuliani keep undermining his position with their own misconduct. His approval rating is on the wane, and he trails his Democratic opponents in key swing states like Wisconsin.\n\nAnd yet most congressional Republicans refuse to break with the president. Despite his obvious wrongdoing and complete unfitness for the job, the vast majority of Republican office holders in Washington are \u201cride or die\u201d supporters of Trump.\n\nSign Up for the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nThe most common explanation for this stalwart commitment is simply fear. \u201cAcross the country,\u201d reports The Washington Post, \u201cmost G.O.P. lawmakers have responded to questions about Trump\u2019s conduct with varying degrees of silence, shrugged shoulders or pained defenses. For now, their collective strategy is simply to survive and not make any sudden moves.\u201d The former Arizona senator Jeff Flake made a version of this point last month, when he said that most Senate Republicans \u2014 \u201cat least 35\u201d \u2014 would vote to remove Trump if it were on a secret ballot.\n\n[Join Jamelle Bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing, culture and ideas from around the internet.

This overwhelming support is a threat to almost any lawmaker who breaks ranks. Challenge Trump and you may end up in a primary against a more MAGA-compliant opponent.\n\nI think there\u2019s another explanation \u2014 one that accounts for Republican behavior without casting these lawmakers as would-be dissidents.\n\nOn most issues, congressional Republicans don\u2019t actually disagree with or disapprove of the president. They might find him coarse and occasionally abhorrent \u2014 when he was still the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan took a shot at Trump after his \u201cboth sides\u201d remarks regarding the white supremacist march and violence in Charlottesville, Va. \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean they have a problem with his administration.\n\nAnd why would they? Despite his somewhat heterodox campaign, Trump has been a remarkably conservative president. For most Republican lawmakers, to oppose Trump would be to oppose their own interests.\n\nMost Republican lawmakers were sent to Washington to fight for spending cuts, lower taxes and conservative judges. Why would any of them stand against a president who has delivered on each count? Trump has taken an ax to domestic spending programs for the poor \u2014 his Agriculture Department just proposed new cuts to food stamps; he signed a tax cut that funnels trillions to the highest earners; and he stacked the federal judiciary with right-wing ideologues. It\u2019s hard to imagine a better outcome for a conservative politician.\n\nWhen Trump occasionally deviates from conservative orthodoxy \u2014 or otherwise bucks the party\u2019s consensus \u2014 Republican lawmakers try to push him back in line. Earlier this year, Senate Republicans didn\u2019t hesitate to challenge the administration on its plan to impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods imported from Mexico. \u201cI will yield to nobody in passion and seriousness and commitment for securing the border,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said to reporters at the time. \u201cBut there\u2019s no reason for Texas farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and small businesses to pay the price of massive new taxes.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Senate Republicans took a collective stand against Trump after the White House announced his plan this week to withdraw American forces from northern Syria, clearing the path for Turkish military operations against Kurds in the region. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, warned Trump against a \u201cprecipitous withdrawal\u201d; Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called the move \u201ca big win for Iran and Assad, a big win for ISIS\u201d; Ben Sasse of Nebraska said the president \u201cneeds to know that this bad decision will likely result in the slaughter of allies who fought with us, including women and children.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that the Republican base isn\u2019t invested in American foreign policy toward Syria. It\u2019s also true, however, that Trump may well lash out against his Republican critics, which could turn his voters against them on this particular issue. But Senate Republicans spoke right up. This time around, the fear that\u2019s supposed to drive their acquiescence to Trump doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIf Republicans are willing to challenge Trump on his foreign policy, including the disposition of American troops abroad, then the difference when it comes to Ukraine \u2014 as well as other scandals, like the president\u2019s continued corruption and self-dealing \u2014 may just be that they don\u2019t see a problem. You can read Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s willingness to downplay Trump\u2019s open call to intervene in the 2020 election as a craven surrender, or you can take it at face value: Maybe Rubio just doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal.\n\nNone of this would be out of character for congressional Republicans. These are the lawmakers who refused to fix the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court killed a key provision of the law in 2013. They said nothing when Trump tried to launch a crusade against imaginary \u201cvoter fraud.\u201d They are at best indifferent to the restrictive laws and voter purges that keep millions of Americans from the polls.\n\nSometimes, the simplest answer is the correct one. Why are most Republicans silent in the face of the president\u2019s attempt to cheat his way to re-election? Perhaps it\u2019s because they don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong \u2014 or because they don\u2019t care if it is.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
