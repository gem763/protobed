A teen protester was shot Friday night in the thigh after an off-duty police officer fired his pistol in self-defense.\n\nLawmaker Dennis Kwok says the High Court on Sunday refused to grant an injunction on the mask ban, but it will hear later this month an application by 24 legislators against Hong Long leader Carrie Lam's use of emergency powers to impose the measure by circumventing the legislature.\n\nLam said the mask ban was needed to stop the violence.\n\nA protesters uses a cut paper bag as a mask in a march in Hong Kong, Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019.
