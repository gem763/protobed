Small-scale farmers will surely grow into commercial farmers,\u201d Camane said.\n\n\u201cThere will be that interest to develop small-scale farmers as there will be demand for high-end products.\u201d\n\nThe entity wants to produce concentrated mango and orange juice, essential oils from oranges, avocados and lavender, vitamin C pills, cold meats, luxury leather goods, and furniture.\n\nMega is also looking at establishing a sugar mill, and may use sugar cane to tap into the renewable energy sector and create biofuel.\n\n\u201cThe profile of the skills that will be created will be high, and we aim to develop opportunities for those who are uneducated to be able to do something of value,\u201d said Camane.\n\nHe added that some investors had shown an interest. One investor is keen on a renewable energy plant to supply electricity to tenants in the SEZ.\n\nThe SEZ, Camane said, was situated in Nkomazi because it was close to the N4 Maputo Corridor toll road and the Port of Maputo.\n\nThe area also has rail connections to export to markets in the Southern African Development Community and the rest of the world.\n\nCamane said that other governments would be involved to ensure the success of the project as investors would need accommodation, schools and other social infrastructure.", "description": "The area, which is close to eSwatini and Mozambique, has the rail and road infrastructure for a special economic zone, and predicted investments will boost GDP and uplift communities.", "authors": ["Sizwe Sama Yende"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9467/2e7e4c335f1d45038042cacd5749d0b4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
