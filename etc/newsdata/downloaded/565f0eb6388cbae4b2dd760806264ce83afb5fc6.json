The 31-year-old Czech has also played for the Florida Panthers, Chicago Blackhawks and Winnipeg Jets.\n\n\"Eight hundred, it's a special number and I was definitely excited for sure,\" Frolik said. \"Couldn't go better, to score on the second shift.\"\n\nAndrew Mangiapane also scored, and Elias Lindholm added an empty-net goal for Calgary, which snapped a two-game losing skid.\n\nDavid Rittich made 21 saves and improved to 3-2 on the season.\n\nDefenseman Matt Niskanen scored early in the third period as the Flyers closed within 2-1.\n\nBrian Elliott made 35 saves in his first start of the season for the Flyers.\n\nWith Elliott pulled for an extra attacker, the Flyers couldn't produce an equalizer in the final two minutes of regulation.\n\nElliott stopped Lindholm twice in the first four minutes of the third.\n\n\"If there is anything positive to take from tonight's game, I would say it's the play of our goaltender Brian Elliott who played a really strong game,\" Flyers head coach Alain Vigneault.\n\n\"He did what a goaltender is supposed to do, which is give your team a chance to win. He gave us a chance to come back in the third.\n\n\"We definitely did not play the way we wanted to. We didn't execute and we didn't make any plays with the puck.\n\n\"We're going to have an opportunity to jump back tomorrow and do a better job.\"\n\nTravis Konecny fed Niskanen in the high slot from behind the net for Philadelphia's first goal of the game at 4:58.\n\nKonecny's assist was his seventh point in four games.\n\nThe Flyers opened their regular season in Prague against the Chicago Blackhawks and returned to Philadelphia for one home game before hitting the road again in Western Canada.\n\n\"It hasn't seemed to affect us. Maybe it did tonight. I don't know,\" Niskanen said. \"It's not an ideal situation but I don't think anybody in here is going to use that as an excuse.\n\n\"We just had two days off. We should be fresh, ready to go. We weren't good enough in the first two periods.\"\n\nTrailing by a goal, Philadelphia pressed early in the second period.\n\nRittich stopped Oskar Lindblom in the first minute and shut down James van Reimsdyk twice in the slot four minutes in.\n\nMangiapane made it 2-0 at 14:15. Flames captain Mark Giordano dished the puck to Mangiapane at the point, and his low knuckler beat Elliott on the stick side.\n\nFrolik scored at 1:35 of the first period. He knocked down a clearing attempt by Flyers defenseman Justin Braun and whipped the puck over Elliott's glove.\n\nNOTES: A Calgary goal with five seconds remaining in the opening period was waived off. Officials ruled Sean Monahan kicked the puck into Philadelphia's net.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlyers: Finish a three-game trip at Edmonton on Wednesday.\n\nFlames: Host the Detroit Red Wings on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
