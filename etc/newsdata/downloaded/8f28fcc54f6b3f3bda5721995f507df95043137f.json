Wales\u2019s game against Uruguay and USA versus Tonga were also cleared, but Namibia against Canada in Kamaishi was called off.\n\n\u201cThe decision was taken following a comprehensive assessment of the venue and associated infrastructure on Sunday morning in partnership with the host city,\u201d organisers said in a statement.\n\nThey urged fans to \u201ccheck travel operator information before departing and plan to arrive early as it may take longer than usual to enter the stadium\u201d.\n\nIreland\u2019s bonus-point 47-5 win against Samoa makes the Yokohama match a straight shoot-out between the hosts and Scotland to decide the final qualifier from the tightly contested Pool A.\n\nJapan are four points ahead in the table, putting them in the box seat to reach their first quarter-final. For Scotland, even a win might not be enough with a maximum two bonus points on offer for the losing side.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Public safety\u2019 \u2013\n\nTwo other matches far from the path of the storm will also go ahead as scheduled \u2014 the Wales-Uruguay clash in the far southwestern city of Kumamoto, and USA-Tonga in Hanazono near Osaka.\n\nBut tournament director Alan Gilpin said he had \u201cno option\u201d but to cancel Sunday\u2019s early match between Canada and Namibia in the northeastern town of Kamaishi due to significant typhoon damage.\n\nLandslides and flooding in the vicinity of the stadium and along access roads to the venue following torrential rain meant the game had to be scrapped on \u201cpublic safety\u201d grounds, organisers said in a statement.\n\nThe cancellation was a blow for the northern town of Kamaishi, whose hosting of World Cup games was a potent symbol of recovery from a 2011 tsunami disaster when it was nearly wiped off the map.\n\nIt also robbed Namibia of a chance to grab their first World Cup win and end their record run of 22 games at the tournament without a victory. Canada are without a win in their last 10 World Cup matches.\n\nIn the end, only one game was held at the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium \u2014 Uruguay\u2019s stunning, 30-27 upset of Fiji in Pool D.\n\nThe stadium, the only purpose-built venue at the World Cup, was built on the site of a school which was the scene for the \u201cMiracle of Kamaishi\u201d, when more than 400 children sprinted into the mountains to safety.\n\n\u201cOur hearts go out to the teams and also their fans, but also the people of Kamaishi, who have been incredible during what has been a special journey in recent years,\u201d said Gilpin.\n\nOrganisers said fans should not travel to the stadium, which will be closed, and they would be entitled to a full refund.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 rain \u2013\n\nHagibis made landfall on Saturday evening and barrelled across the country, bringing fierce winds and torrential rain.\n\nIt was a direct hit on Tokyo and Yokohama, a city of some three million just south of the capital.\n\nAcross the country, at least seven people died and several others were injured or reported missing due to the storm, which brought \u201cunprecedented\u201d amounts of rain to the country.\n\nSevere flooding has already taken place with many rivers breaking their banks, including the Tama River which runs through Tokyo.\n\nOrganisers had earlier cancelled two matches planned for Saturday \u2014 England v France and New Zealand v Italy, both in the path of the storm.\n\nIt was the first time in the 32-year history of the Rugby World Cup that games had been scrapped, and raised criticism of the decision to hold the tournament during Japan\u2019s typhoon season.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Rugby World Cup organisers gave the go-ahead for Japan\u2019s crunch match against Scotland on Sunday despite the fall-out from", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/5a252b_typhoon-hagibis-brought-unprecedented-rain-large-parts-japan-crunch-japan-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
