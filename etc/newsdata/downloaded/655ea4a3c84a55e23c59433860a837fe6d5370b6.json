The world at the moment is a circus with us at the centre. I am not influenced by it.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer has a number of injuries but with key players David De Gea and Paul Pogba having seemingly been ruled out of the fixture on Thursday the under-pressure United boss changed his stance 24 hours later.\n\nPaul Pogba, right, and David De Gea have been at the centre of pre-match speculation (Martin Rickett/PA)\n\nKlopp, however, is not falling for it.\n\n\u201cI am 100 per cent aware of the strength of Manchester United, I expect their best possible line-up,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI think Ole said \u2018No chance for De Gea and Pogba\u2019. Today it is \u2018Maybe\u2019 and tomorrow it is \u2018100 per cent\u2019.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how all these games are played. No problem with that but I am old enough, I am experienced enough, to judge these things in the right way.\n\n\u201cThe less the opposing manager knows about your line-up the better it is, so that\u2019s an advantage.\n\n\u201cI am four years in England and it is still strange how little you know about whether a player is fit or not \u2013 in Germany we allow the press four or five times a week to watch training so you cannot hide anything.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer also suggested the visit of Liverpool was the ideal game for his side to kick-start their floundering season.\n\nUnited would take great delight in denying their arch-rivals the chance to equal Manchester City\u2019s record of 18 successive Premier League victories.\n\nKlopp, however, took issue with that.\n\n\u201cThey said that we are the perfect opponent \u2013 I don\u2019t think there are a lot of teams who would love to play us at the moment, it looks like Man United are the only team who does,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe have to make sure that is a misunderstanding.\n\n\u201cThey have a really good football team there in a situation they don\u2019t like so they want to change it.\n\n\u201cWe have to make sure if they want to change it they have to start a week later.\u201d\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has come under pressure at Old Trafford (Owen Humphreys/PA)\n\nIn comparison with Klopp, Solskjaer actually has a better record after their first 29 Premier League matches: 14 wins and seven draws compared to the German\u2019s 13 wins and eight draws.\n\nThe Norwegian remains under scrutiny but Klopp feels that is unfair.\n\n\u201cI have no clue about his position. It\u2019s not important what you are writing, it is more important what the board, Ed Woodward and the Glazer family are telling him. I don\u2019t have an opinion about that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want every manager in the world to have as much time as he can get to bring through his ideas, but you can never compare situations \u2013 our situation when I came in to their situation now.\n\n\u201cMan United is a massive club and nobody is ready to wait for success. In my case it was not any different.\n\n\u201cHe has to live with that. If there was any doubt internally, it would be bad. But as long as it is only externally, that is not important really.\n\n\u201cI know people think sometimes the manager has to manage Real Madrid before he can take over but that is not the truth. He knows what he has to do.\u201d", "description": "The Premier League leaders are in pursuit of records as they take on a struggling Manchester United side.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/21/wire-19902862-1571431139-152_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
