But some states are refusing to sign on, saying it doesn\u2019t do enough to hold the Sacklers and their company accountable.\n\nThe legal battle will play out in court over time, but here\u2019s what we know now:\n\n___\n\nWHAT ROLE DID THE SACKLERS PLAY IN THE FAMILY BUSINESS?\n\nBrothers Mortimer, Raymond and Arthur Sackler - all physicians - purchased Purdue Frederick in 1952. Raymond and Mortimer Sackler bought Arthur Sackler\u2019s stake upon his death in 1987 and the two brothers founded Purdue Pharma four years later.\n\nBoth have since died. One of the heirs, Richard Sackler, served as president of the company and some served on its board. All have left the board in recent years.\n\nEight of the family members - Richard, Jonathan, Mortimer, Kathe, Beverly, Theresa and David Sackler and Ilene Sackler Lefcourt - are named repeatedly in lawsuits nationwide for their roles; some suits name many more.\n\n___\n\nHOW MUCH MONEY DOES THE SACKLER FAMILY HAVE?\n\nThe Sacklers\u2019 net worth was an estimated $13 billion as of 2016, making them America\u2019s 19th-richest family, according to Forbes magazine. But the exact value of their fortune is not known and believed by some to be much larger.\n\nSeveral states say that the family has worked methodically to move money out of Purdue to insulate their fortune.\n\nAn Associated Press review of court papers, securities filings by companies that have had dealings with Purdue, and documents leaked from an exclusive Bermuda law firm indicate the family has shielded their wealth in an intricate web of companies and trusts, including some located in offshore tax havens. The family has previously declined to discuss the matter.\n\nThe size and scope of their fortune may become clearer in court depending on how things proceed. But given the apparent complexity the financial web, it could prove difficult and time consuming to reveal it completely.\n\n___\n\nHOW MUCH COULD THEY END UP PAYING?\n\nIt depends on how various legal actions play out.\n\nThe Sacklers have already agreed to pay up to $4.5 billion. That amount is contingent on the sale of the family\u2019s international drug company, Mundipharma. They also would lose any wealth from the future operation of that company.\n\nThey could potentially pay much more depending on the outcome of bankruptcy proceedings and lawsuits directly naming the family. Generally in a bankruptcy, all the company\u2019s assets are fair game for creditors but the owner\u2019s wealth is considered separate. There are some scenarios, however, where the personal wealth of the owners could be pursued, according to legal experts.\n\nThe Sacklers\u2019 wealth could be at risk if the line between the company and owners was not properly observed. For instance, if the owners weren\u2019t keeping separate accounting books or they were having the company pay for their personal expenses, they could be found personally liable for actions of the company, according to Michael Simkovic, professor of law and accounting at the University of Southern California. But those types of cases are unusual and hard to win, he said.\n\nAnother way they could be held to account is if they were actively involved in the day-to-day management of the company and were personally responsible for some acts, or were managing and directing people who were responsible for acts that led to liability, Simkovic said.\n\nJessica Gabel Cino, a law professor at Georgia State University, said that in large bankruptcies like this one, family members do sometimes have to make contributions to the bankruptcy estate.\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to leave the bankruptcy unscathed,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the same time, they can use the bankruptcy to protect themselves from other lawsuits. That\u2019s because as soon as the company files for protection, it could put all other lawsuits against the company on hold.\n\nThe Sackler family is facing a number of lawsuits that name them personally. There is some leeway within the bankruptcy court to decide if those cases will be put on hold until bankruptcy proceedings are complete or be a part of the bankruptcy itself, depending on the nature of the claim.\n\nThe Sacklers have denied any wrongdoing.\n\n___\n\nHOW MANY LAWSUITS ARE THE SACKLERS FACING?\n\nAt this time, more than 20 states have sued family members by name for their role in the crisis. Each suit varies slightly, but many claim the Sacklers knowingly misled the public and medical communities while draining money from the company.\n\nIf the lawsuits against the families allege criminal activity - such as fraud or actions that would deliberately hurt others - those would likely move forward regardless of the bankruptcy, said Richard Squire, a professor at the Fordham University Law School.\n\n\u201cThe bankruptcy proceeding would likely block some claims,\u201d he said. \u201cThe claims that include a high degree of fault - criminal activity or recklessness -may survive but they are riskier.\u201d\n\n___\n\nHOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE?\n\nSome corporate bankruptcy proceedings are prepackaged, meaning the plan has been agreed upon by everyone involved beforehand. Those can move through the court quickly and be resolved within a month. But given the array of claimants and complexity of Purdue, experts say it will likely take longer.\n\nIn the bankruptcy of Adelphia Communications, for instance, the cable television company filed for protection from creditors in 2002 but its agreement took five years to gain approval.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Alex Veiga and Anne D\u2019Innocenzio contributed to this report\n\n___\n\nThis article has been corrected to clarify that one Sackler heir served as president of the company, not that some oversaw operations day-to-day.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In a story Sept. 12 about the impact of a possible Purdue Pharma bankruptcy on the Sackler family, The Associated Press reported erroneously who founded Purdue Pharma and when.
