From Moscow to Manhattan, millions around the world marched in one of the largest youth-led demonstrations in history. Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg, whose solitary protests triggered a global movement, championed environmental action in front of tens of thousands in New York City. Close to 300,000 people massed near Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg Gate. In the Solomon Islands, threatened by a rising ocean, students rowed to protests in longboats.\n\nThe coordinated \u201cclimate strike\u201d in more that 150 countries delivered an unmistakable message to world leaders convening this week at the United Nations. In the West, including the United States, opinion polls show majorities \u2014 especially among young populations \u2014 in favor of substantive government action to address global warming. And there\u2019s an urgency for that action.\n\nA major U.N.-backed report found that the past five years were the warmest on record and that annual sea-level rise has dramatically sped up from two decades ago. New data suggests that the growth rate for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is 20 percent faster than the past decade. The report warned that if emissions continue to rise at their current pace, the world will be on the brink of catastrophe by 2040, rocked by disasters that follow extreme weather, drought and inundated coastlines.\n\nThe \ud83c\udf0d\u2019s leading #climate science organizations have published a new report for the @UN #ClimateAction Summit.\n\n\n\nIt shows the glaring \u2013 and growing \u2013 gap between agreed targets to tackle global warming and the actual reality.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffdhttps://t.co/g06YO5y8QT #TimeForAction pic.twitter.com/ygqllu92UZ \u2014 UN Climate Change (@UNFCCC) September 22, 2019\n\n\u201cGovernments always follow public opinion, everywhere in the world, sooner or later,\u201d U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told reporters last week, adding that \u201cwe need to keep telling the truth to people and be confident that the political system, especially democratic political systems, will in the end deliver.\u201d\n\nGuterres raised the alarm ahead of a U.N.-led climate action summit on Monday, where some 60 world leaders will announce major new commitments to cutting emissions and transforming their economies along more sustainable lines. Not unlike his itinerary at the Group of Seven summit in France last month, President Trump will skip the special session on climate for a meeting on religious freedom, one of his administration\u2019s pet ideological projects.\n\nThat\u2019s hardly a surprise. Abroad, Trump thumbed his nose at the international scientific consensus and commenced his nation\u2019s withdrawal from the landmark Paris climate accord. At home, he has worked to unravel myriad environmental regulations, including a ruling last week revoking the state of California\u2019s ability to set its own auto emissions targets. Trump argues that multilateral pacts and state regulations are an unfair shackle on the American economy. He has waved away American responsibility for curbing emissions by pointing to the mammoth energy needs of developing nations such as India and China, whose governments and state-run companies are still expanding investment in coal.\n\nAnd he\u2019s not alone. Just last week, Trump hosted Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who memorably once brought a lump of coal to Parliament as a prop to brandish against his opponents\u2019 plans to push renewable energy.\n\nTrump also has a kindred spirit in Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who became the environmental villain of the moment when international attention fell on the fires in the Amazon and the role his right-wing government\u2019s loosening of forestry protections played in the spread of the blazes. Brazilian Foreign Minister Eduardo Araujo defended his boss during a visit to Washington earlier this month, casting the rhetoric around climate change as a leftist conspiracy and \u201ca pretext for dictatorship\u201d because its activists somehow seek to \u201csilence debate.\u201d He said Trump and Bolsonaro were outliers \u201cfighting\u201d against a \u201cglobalist pact.\u201d\n\nWielding this ideological animus, Araujo told Today\u2019s WorldView at a briefing that his government would bring to the United Nations a message anchored around the sovereignty of nations. That would comfortably echo the politics of Trump\u2019s last two speeches from the dais of the General Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur political climate is not friendly to this discussion at this moment. Multilateralism is under attack. We have seen the rise of authoritarian governments,\u201d Alice Hill of the Council on Foreign Relations told the New York Times. \u201cWe see these pressures as working against us. We don\u2019t have leadership in the United States to help guide the process.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 250,000 people gathered in New York to hear Greta Thunberg speak.\n\n\n\nTo wild cheers - followed by chants of \"Greta! Greta!\" - she told them: \"We will make them hear us\" https://t.co/jUfVHc1LvK pic.twitter.com/CVIllJ1XbR \u2014 Sky News (@SkyNews) September 21, 2019\n\nFor that reason, the impetus may have to come elsewhere. A handful of U.S. governors will be in attendance in a bid to fill the political vacuum left by Trump. Dozens of major multinational companies with a combined market cap of $2.3 trillion have signed on to a U.N. climate pact committing themselves to bring down their emissions and \u201cdecarbonize\u201d in the years ahead.\n\nIn an interview with Today\u2019s WorldView last week, American billionaire and philanthropist Bill Gates said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that climate change was not a bipartisan cause in the United States. He pointed to the need not just for symbolic gestures, but for significant public and private investment to transform economies and foster \u201can innovation ecosystem\u201d that would \u201creduce the cost of going green very dramatically.\u201d (If that entailed raising taxes on the wealthy, Gates told Today\u2019s WorldView, he would have no problem obliging.)\n\n\u201cClimate change is a very difficult problem,\u201d said Gates, whose influential foundation identified in a report last week the effects of intensifying droughts and floods as one of the factors exacerbating inequality in countries around the world. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like disease eradication. You need to succeed throughout the world.\u201d\n\nGates is struck though by the volume of the current conversation around the climate and \u201cthe intensity of interest\u201d among the public. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a contrast versus five years ago, where it was hardly discussed at all,\u201d Gates told Today\u2019s WorldView.\n\nThat growing awareness is fueled by real events. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to not be terrified by the unraveling that we are seeing from the Arctic to the Amazon, as well as the terrifying human impacts in places like the Bahamas. And how can we not be enraged that planetary arsonists are occupying the highest office, from Brazil to the United States?\u201d prominent leftist activist and author Naomi Klein told the New York Review of Books. \u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s not just the planet that is on fire. So is the climate justice movement, shaming politicians, demanding a transformational approach to the crisis, redrawing the political map.\u201d\n\nAfter deliberations in New York, a new wave of climate protests are planned for Friday.\n\n\u201cI have the feeling that politicians are often just [focusing on] the next vote,\u201d said 25-year-old student Jakob Lochner, speaking to my colleagues on the sidelines of Berlin\u2019s protest. \u201cIf you look around, there are so many people on the street; there is kind of a social tipping point.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
