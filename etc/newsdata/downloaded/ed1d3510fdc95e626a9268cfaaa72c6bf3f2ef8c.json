It\u2019s also developing a universal source of cells for use in immunotherapy \u2014 to act as \u201cdisease-eaters\u201d, as Disley puts it.\n\nSpeculative IP development is another focus. \u201cBecause of the systematic nature of the technology we\u2019re in a position very rapidly to identify areas of therapy that have particular cell conversions at their essence \u2014 and then drive that IP generation around those cells very quickly and create an IP footprint,\u201d he says.\n\nPartnering deals is the third piece. Mogrify is also working with others to co-develop and bring targeted cell therapies to market. Disley says it\u2019s already closed some partnerships, though it\u2019s not announcing any names yet.\n\nThe startup is drawing on around a decade\u2019s worth of recent work genomics science. And specifically on a data-set generated by an international research effort, called Fantom 5, which its founders had early access to.\n\n\u201cWe started with that massive Fantom data-set. That\u2019s the baseline, the background if you like. Think of it like two cities in America: Chicago and New York. There\u2019s your source cell, there\u2019s your target cell. And because you have all the background data of every piece of the network \u2014 every building, every skyscraper \u2014 if you look at the two you can identify the difference in the gene expression, therefore you can identify which factors will regulate a wide array of those genes. So you can start identifying the differences between the two,\u201d explains Disley.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve then added to that massive data sets in DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions\u2026 so you start to now overlay all of that data. And then we\u2019ve added on top of that new next-gen sequencing data and epigenetic data. So you\u2019ve now got this massive data-set. It\u2019s like having a network map between all the different cell types. So you\u2019re therefore then able to make predictions on how many interventions, what interventions are needed to drive that change of state \u2014 and it\u2019s systematic. It doesn\u2019t just recommend one set. There\u2019s a ranking. It can go down to hundreds. And there is some overlap and redundancies, so for example if one \u2014 you\u2019re preferred thing \u2014 doesn\u2019t work the way you wanted it to you can go back and select another.\n\n\u201cOr if there\u2019s an IP issue around that factor you can ignore that piece of the network and use an alternative route. And once you\u2019ve got to your target cell, if it needs to some tweaking you can actually re-sequence it and take that back and that\u2019s your starting cell again. And you can go through this optimization process. So what comes out at the other end\u2026 you\u2019ve got a patent that it like a small molecule composition of matter patent; it\u2019s the therapeutic. So you\u2019re not coming out with the target, you\u2019re actually coming out with here is the composition of matter on the cell.\u201d\n\nIn terms of timeframe for getting novel cell therapies from concept to market Disley suggests a range of between four and seven years.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve identified the cell type that can be be the basis of your GMP manufacturable process and then you can tweak that to take it to the therapeutic indication you can develop a cell therapy and bring that to market in five years,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the old days with small molecules where it can take ten, 15, 20 years to get a serious therapy on the market.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re treating patients\u2026 is because there are no other treatments for them, when you go into phase two and do your safety study [and] efficacy study you\u2019re actually treating patients already in terms of their disease. And if you get it right you can get a fast track approval. Or a conditional approval\u2026 so that you may not even have to do a phase 3 [testing].\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not using any artificial intelligence here,\u201d he also emphasizes, pointing to his experience investing in companies in the \u201cbig extreme data space\u201d which he argues do best by using \u201cunbiased approaches\u201d.\n\n\u201cAI I think is still trying to find its way,\u201d he continues. \u201cBecause in its essence it will be able to get to answers with smaller amounts of data but it\u2019s only as good as the data you train it on. And the danger with AI\u2026 it just learns to recognize what you want it to recognize. It doesn\u2019t know what it doesn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cIn combination, once you continue to generate this massive cell network data etc you can start applying aspects of machine learning and AI. But you couldn\u2019t do Mogrify with AI without the data. You have to do it that way. And the data is so complex and combinatorial \u2014 2,000 transcription factors, in terms of regulation of those genes, they then interact in network to do the protein-protein interactions, you\u2019ve got epigenetic aspects of that, you could even start adding cell microbiome effects to that later \u2014 so you\u2019ve got a lot of factors that could influence the phenotype of the cell that\u2019s coming out the other end.\n\n\u201cSo I think with AI you have to be a little careful. I think it will be a more optimizing tool once you\u2019ve got sufficient confidence in your system.\u201d\n\nThe plan for the Series A funding is to ramp up Mogrify\u2019s corporate operations and headcount \u2014 including bringing in senior executives and expertise from industry \u2014 as well as spending to fund its therapy development programs.\n\nDisley notes its recent appointment of Dr Jane Osbourn as chair as one example.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing in more people with a lot of cell therapy experience from big pharma, around then more on the manufacturing and delivery of that \u2014 so really building so that we\u2019re not just a tech company,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve very strong already, we\u2019re already 35 people on the tech and early stage drug discovery side \u2014 we\u2019re going to add another 30 to that. But that\u2019s going to be increasingly more people with big pharma, cell therapy development, manufacturing experience to get products on to market.\u201d\n\nPartner search is another focus for the Series A. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find the right strategy partners. We\u2019re not doing services, we\u2019re not doing products \u2014 so we want to find the right strategic partners in terms of doing multi-programs in a partnership,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd then a series of more tactical deals where people have got a specific problem with a cell conversion. These more turnkey deals, if you like. We still get up-fronts, milestones and royalties but they\u2019re smaller.\u201d\n\nDespite now having enough money for the next two to two and half years it\u2019s also leaving the Series A open to continue expanding the round over the next 12 months \u2014 up to a maximum of another $16M.\n\n\u201cWe have so many interested investors,\u201d Disley tells us. \u201cThis round we didn\u2019t actually open our round. We did it with internal investors and people we\u2019re very close to who we\u2019ve worked with before, and there were investors lining up\u2026 [so] we are leaving it open so that in these next 12 months we may choose to increase the amount we bring in.\n\n\u201cIt would be a maximum of another $16M if it was an A round but we may decide just to go straight forward if we progress very fast to a much bigger B round.\u201d", "description": "Cambridge, UK-based biotech startup Mogrify, which is working on systematizing the development of novel cell therapies in areas such as regenerative medicine, has closed an initial $16 million Series A.
