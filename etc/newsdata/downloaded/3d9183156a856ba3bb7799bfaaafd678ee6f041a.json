(AP) - Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason knows a handful of areas where his Commodores can improve quickly on offense.\n\nStart faster, snap the ball better to the quarterback, have Riley Neal move up in the pocket rather than scramble sideways and throw the ball downfield in a combination of issues.\n\nNot playing the nation\u2019s No. 3 team also could help.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Mason said Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s no panic here. You just learn a lot about yourself in game ones that you can transfer.\u201d\n\nThe Commodores (0-1) certainly have plenty of room for improvement. They managed only 225 total yards in their opening 30-6 loss to Georgia. Ke\u2019Shawn Vaughn, the top returning rusher in the Southeastern Conference, was held to 74 yards rushing and 24 yards receiving.\n\nTheir new starting quarterback was 14 of 25 for just 83 yards passing, and Neal didn\u2019t complete a pass longer than 12 yards. Neal connected with wide receiver Kalija Lipscomb only three times for eight yards, while tight end Jared Pinkney had two catches for 11 yards.\n\nThe graduate transfer from Ball State beat out Deuce Wallace for the starting job. It didn\u2019t help that Vanderbilt played without the left half of its offensive line because of injuries, something Mason said kept Neal from taking shots downfield.\n\nLeft tackle Devin Cochran and left guard Saige Young remain day to day with unspecified injuries. Mason said backup running back and kick returner Jamauri Wakefield will miss some time after being injured late against Georgia and being carted off the field.\n\nNow the Commodores visit Purdue (0-1) on Saturday still looking for their first touchdown after settling for a pair of field goals in the opener. That\u2019s not the start they expected even after having to replace departed quarterback Kyle Shurmur from an offense that averaged 28.5 points and 411.2 yards per game last season.\n\nMason remains confident Vanderbilt picked the right quarterback as the new starter.\n\n\u201cThat dude\u2019s a good football player,\u201d Mason said. \u201cI like his temperament. I like his demeanor. I mean he never seemed rattled, OK man, or out of sorts in terms of frustration, and that\u2019s what you want from a quarterback. The reality was we\u2019ve got to do a better job all the way around. He\u2019s going to do his job. Everybody\u2019s got a job to do, and so we\u2019ll be better this week.\u201d\n\nPurdue coach Jeff Brohm knows how much experience Mason has back on offense.\n\n\u201cThey have some good players and first game of the year when you play Georgia, that\u2019s a tough task,\u201d Brohm said.\n\nGetting Vaughn room to run could help, and he has some experience at Purdue, running for 180 yards in a big win Nov. 7, 2015, while playing for the Boilermakers before transferring to Vanderbilt. Mason said he didn\u2019t know about that performance, with Vaughn not mentioning that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all tied together,\u201d Mason said. \u201cWe need a great offensive performance on Saturday.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.
