The Smart Score integrates all of TipRanks' data on a stock, using eight factors known to predict market performance. A score of 1 indicates the stock is likely to underperform the market in the near-term.\n\nImportant numbers\n\nBy far the most important numbers for Nio at this time are related to its balance sheet and its costs.\n\nAt the end of the second quarter Nio had approximately $600 million in liquidity. About $342 million of that was in cash, $148.5 million in short-term investment, and $200 million in convertible note financing from Tencent Holdings.\n\nOver the last several quarters Nio spent around $180 million on R&D per quarter. On its second quarter earnings call the company said it is cutting R&D spending while shrinking its workforce from 9,900 to 7,800.\n\nTaking into account the cut in spending, the company will probably still spend as high as $150 million a quarter in my view. It's possible it could be less than that because that's my high-end spending outlook.\n\nI'm looking for operating losses to be somewhere around $300 million on the low end, which means, based upon the numbers here, that the company as it stands today, only has enough liquidity to run operations at best, to the end of 2019.\n\nThe challenge to turn a profit has gotten harder because of the reduction in subsidies by the Chinese government from $9,500 for the ES8 in 2018, to only $1,600 as of the end of June 2019.\n\nSince the company hasn't released its figures for the third quarter yet, we have to go by its performance in the second quarter, which were unimpressive to say the least.\n\nAs of the end of June, gross margins plummeted from a negative 13.4 percent in the first quarter of 2019 to a negative 33.4 percent in the second quarter.\n\nOperating losses in the reporting period were a hefty $469.9 million.\n\nWith the company not releasing its third-quarter numbers yet, it has to be assumed the results are worse than expected, which could drive the share price of the company near the $1 per share mark, if not lower.\n\nThe Tencent factor\n\nThere are a number of scenarios that could play out for Nio, with the most likely to be a cash infusion from Tencent Holdings. Even though it's possible Tencent may be reluctant to throw more cash at Nio, it will probably want to defend its exposure to Nio by supplying it with a cash lifeline. The big question there is whether or not Tencent considers the risk worth it.\n\nMy thought is Tencent's self-interest will result in it providing more capital to Nio, although there may be some stipulations that come with it.\n\nUnder the current conditions of the company, it's most likely that Tencent or another China-based auto company will acquire Nio and take it private. I don't think that'll come about until it releases its most recent quarterly results.\n\nStory continues", "description": "When Nio (NIO) released its latest sales numbers for the latest quarter, the 35.1 percent increase in sales gave some investors optimism for the company's future potential.While the increase in sales looks impressive, the reality is the company only delivered 4,799 vehicles, with the majority of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/12nX486YLFji651XgoLdjQ--~B/aD04NjU7dz0xMjczO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/tipranks_452/6cf344ddee2d708cd61a5ea9642c1791", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
