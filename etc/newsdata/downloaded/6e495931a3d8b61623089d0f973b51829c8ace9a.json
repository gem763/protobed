Indeed the necessary coordination is being carried out by our headquarters and the Americans,\" Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar was quoted as saying on Saturday.\n\nAkar was speaking as he and military commanders visited operation headquarters along the border, state-owned Anadolu news agency reported.\n\nSeventy-four Kurdish-led fighters, 49 Turkey-backed Syrian rebels and 20 civilians have been killed in the fighting, according to war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\nThe United Nations has said 100,000 people have fled their homes.\n\nTurkey's Defence Ministry said 415 YPG militants had been \"neutralised\" since the operation began, a term that commonly means killed.\n\n\n\n\n\nISLAMIC STATE\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), with the Kurdish YPG as its main fighting element, now holds most of the territory that once made up Islamic State's \"caliphate\" in Syria, and has been keeping thousands of fighters from the jihadist group in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nThe Kurdish militia say the Turkish assault could allow the jihadist group to re-emerge as some of its followers were escaping from prisons.\n\nIn its first big attack since the assault began on Tuesday, Islamic State claimed responsibility for a deadly car bomb in Qamishli, the largest city in the Kurdish-held area, even as the city came under Turkish shelling.\n\nFive Islamic State fighters fled a jail there, and foreign women from the group being held in a camp torched tents and attacked guards with sticks and stones, the SDF said.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper has told his Turkish counterpart they should deescalate the situation before it becomes \"irreparable\", while European Council President Donald Tusk warned it could lead to a \"humanitarian catastrophe\".\n\nErdogan's spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, responded to the criticism on Saturday, saying \"Turkey's fight is against terrorists, not Kurds or civilians\", and telling those who condemn Turkey that thousands of civilians were killed in U.S.-led coalition operations in Syria's Raqqa and Iraq's Mosul.\n\n\"Blackmail and threats will never deter Turkey from its just cause,\" Kalin wrote on Twitter. \"God willing victory will be ours.\"", "description": "Turkish forces stepped up their bombardment around a town in northeast Syria on Saturday, the fourth day of an offensive against a Kurdish militia, after U.S. troops in the region came under artillery fire from Turkish positions.
