Legend has it that the scourge of medieval Catholicism had the idea while walking through a forest at night, where the starry night sky was glistening through the trees. Inspired, Luther chopped down a tree, took it home, and decorated it with candles to recreate the effect.\n\nFast forward 500 years and the Christmas tree is a near-universal feature in our homes during December (although health and safety has put paid to those fire hazard candles). And that means there\u2019s half a millennium of intimidating Christmas tree expertise that you have to crack at this time of year.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ve laid out everything you need to know to buy the perfect Christmas tree in 2019.\n\nLuther may (or may not) have come up with the idea, but it took until the 17th century for the Christmas tree to spread beyond southern Germany. Early decorations hung from prickly pine branches included multi-coloured paper roses, gold foil and fresh apples.\n\nPrince Albert is widely credited as having introduced the Christmas tree to Britain in 1840, but the first known Christmas tree was actually set up in 1800, by Queen Charlotte, the German wife of George III at Queen\u2019s Lodge, Windsor. It grew in popularity among the aristocracy until Albert drew mass attention to the tradition by importing several spruce firs from his native Coburg.\n\nBy 1860, it was considered social suicide among the upper classes not to have one during the festive season.\n\nIt\u2019s a question that would have made dear Luther spit out his Christmas pudding \u2013 but before you decorate a tree, you need to decide whether to go real or artificial.\n\nA common misconception is that artificial trees are better for the environment. The Carbon Trust estimates that a two-metre-tall artificial tree has twice the carbon footprint of a real tree that ends up in a landfill. If that real tree is burned, then the artificial tree\u2019s footprint is ten times as large. Consequently, your artificial tree would need to last at least ten Christmases for it to be considered better for the environment.\n\nAside from the environmental issue, what other reasons are there for going artificial? \u201cSome people really don\u2019t like the needles on real trees, or we would recommend an artificial tree if the client had an allergy,\u201d says Helene Webb of Cardinal Christmas Decorating, a bespoke luxury Christmas decorating service.\n\nAccording to a survey by Haymax, one third of the UK population suffers from an increase in itchy skin and cold-like symptoms after putting up their Christmas tree. An allergy to the real trees, known as \u2018Christmas Tree Syndrome\u2019, is a result of mould that builds up on the branches and trunk. If your symptoms become noticeably worse in and around the room the Christmas tree is kept in, then artificial is the way to go.\n\nAs for going with a real tree, the arguments are all about authenticity. \u201cOne of the nice things about a real Christmas tree is when you do come down every morning, it will be in a different shape from when you went to bed,\u201d says Harry Brightwell, secretary of the British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA). \u201cThey are living, so they change as they\u2019re getting older \u2013 just like the rest of us.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWebb mentions the loss of that Christmas tree fragrance with artificial trees, and while retailers now sell Christmas tree fragrance sticks to try and recreate the smell, they are far from the real deal. \u201cI always say to people who only have an artificial tree that they\u2019re missing out,\u201d says Brightwell. \u201cNo one is going to remember climbing into the loft and pulling down the same tree as last year.\n\n\u201cBuying your Christmas tree is about creating that special event to signal the start of Christmas.\u201d\n\nWhen to buy your real Christmas tree - and how to choose\n\nDo buy early. All Christmas trees are felled at the same time, so there is no point in delaying.\n\nAll Christmas trees are felled at the same time, so there is no point in delaying. Do think twice before buying from a pop-up tree seller. They\u2019ll disappear as fast as they appear, so you won\u2019t be able to return dodgy goods.\n\nThey\u2019ll disappear as fast as they appear, so you won\u2019t be able to return dodgy goods. Do measure the room heightbefore you go out \u2013 and don\u2019t forget the extra room the stand takes. Your tree has to fit!\n\nThe major garden centre chains started to sell Christmas trees in late November and, although many will consider this too early to buy a tree, the truth is that it\u2019s a case of the earlier the better.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no benefit at all from waiting into December,\u201d warns David Mitchell, Wyevale Garden Centre\u2019s Christmas tree expert. According to Mitchell this is because all the trees get cut at the same time, in early-November; their distribution is then drip-fed over the following weeks. It is therefore better to get there early and start caring for and feeding your tree, rather than letting it sit on a pile with all the others, yearning for the water it needs to stay healthy.\n\nOn the BCTGA website, you can put in your postcode and find your local Christmas tree farm, along with the types that they stock. Pop-up Christmas tree sellers will also be out in force during the coming weeks, but it is generally wise to go with a BCTGA member who will be available to help you out should you encounter any future problems with your tree.\n\nYou should be looking for a British-grown tree as its carbon footprint will be substantially less than one that has been transported from mainland Europe. Importantly, it will also be fresher.\n\nRoom height is very important. \u201cA lot of people can get carried away and get something too big for the space and forget that the stand adds an extra 20cm at the bottom,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an easy mistake to make and you might find that you have to cut the top off, which then gives you a conundrum in terms of where are you going to put the fairy.\u201d\n\nGenerally speaking, people look for one of two shapes: tall or wide. The wide, bushy types are more popular in continental Europe, especially in Germany, the Christmas tree\u2019s home. Here in the UK, we are more into tall and slim, possibly due to the fact the average home size is four metres squared smaller.\n\nThe slimmer profile also lets more light shine through the tree branches. And, with Christmas baubles getting ever heavier, they can hold decoration all the way up to the top branches.\n\nThe options:\n\nNordmann fir\n\nA 20ft Nordmann fir tree in St George's Hall, Windsor Castle Credit: PA More\n\nThe BCTGA estimates that 80 percent of the real trees sold in the UK are Nordmann firs. It is sometimes called the non-drop as it doesn\u2019t shed its needles as often as other varieties.\n\nThe Nordmann has lots of defined layers while the needles have a thick, waxy coating (useful if you suffer from allergies). Its soft foliage means it should be lustrous to the touch and won\u2019t have you screaming for the first aid box like other options.\n\nNorway spruce\n\nA Norway spruce Christmas tree Credit: ANDREW CROWLEY/The Telegraph More\n\nThe second-most-popular option is the Norway spruce, which comprises roughly 15 percent of all real trees sold at Christmas. This is the Christmas tree that will tap into your nostalgia \u2013 it used to be the most popular and widely available. However, the needles on a spruce shed more than the Nordmann and are very fine and spiky, making it less practical for families with pets or children who like to explore with their hands. Ouch!\n\nBest of the rest\n\nThe Fraser fir is a good option if you are struggling for space, owing to its tall and slim profile. It is darker green than the Norway and the Nordmann, and has a distinct citrus fragrance. The Noble Fir is the bushiest of the options and has greyish-blue needles. The Scots pine is the only Christmas tree native to the British Isles and the most common Christmas tree option in the US, because it is a relatively easy option to grow and maintain.\n\nLast year, prices on Christmas trees were between \u00a345 to \u00a355 for most 6-7ft Nordman trees grown by official BCTGA members, while Norway spruces were around \u00a325 to \u00a335. Expect to pay the same this Christmas.\n\nWhat to do when at the store\n\nEvery tree is unique, so get among them to assess whether they\u2019re right Credit: Hero Images/Hero Images More\n\nDon\u2019t buy a tree that is in netting.

Don\u2019t buy a tree with pale and tired needles. It\u2019s already on its way out.\n\nRight, you\u2019ve decided on your variety, and where you\u2019re going to pop it. Now comes Christmas tree judgement day.\n\nThe BCTGA estimates that seven million real trees are sold in the UK each year, so there\u2019s plenty of choice. Every tree is unique, so you really have to get in and among them to assess whether they\u2019re right for your needs.\n\nBecause of this, you will want to see the Christmas trees out of the netting. Alarm bells should be jingling if the seller is keeping all their trees in netting.\n\n\u201cIt would beg the question, are they trying to hide something if they haven\u2019t un-netted the trees,\u201d ponders Mitchell. \u201cIt\u2019s also better for the trees to be un-netted so that they can relax. The branches can settle rather than being kept firmly upright throughout the harvest, as you might find that when you take the net off they stay in that position.\u201d\n\nThe Christmas tree outing is like being a singleton hunting for love at the work Christmas party. You want to put that tree through its paces and make sure that this is a relationship that\u2019s going to last more than a few weeks\n\nHere\u2019s the BCTGA\u2019s whistlestop routine when looking for Christmas (tree) love:\n\n\u201cHold the tree in your hands loosely and then run your fingers along the branches to make sure the needles are attached to the tree. We also suggest lifting it a foot off the ground and gently tapping it a couple of times on the floor just to make sure it is healthy and the needles are staying on. You\u2019ll probably find a few brown needles on the inside of the tree drop to the floor, but you wouldn\u2019t expect to see a lot of the green needles do that.\u201d\n\nThe needles should be a dark green, rather than pale and worn out. Look for symmetry. The tree should feel lustrous to the touch and not dried up.\n\nTreat it mean to keep it keen, but don\u2019t forget to show it a good time. Give the tree a little spin so that you can see movement in the branches and needles. Imagine that tree sitting in your house, and getting through the awkward festive meet and greet with the parents. Is this the one for you?\n\nHow to look after your Christmas tree\n\nDo take the tree out of the netting. Asap!\n\nAsap! Do saw off the bottom of the tree. Then slice off the bark on the base for optimum water retention.\n\nThen slice off the bark on the base for optimum water retention. Don\u2019t bring the tree indoors straight away.

It\u2019s thirsty...\n\nThe first thing to do when you get your tree home is to cut the netting open. Let it move and breathe.\n\nIf you\u2019ve bought early, the tree doesn\u2019t necessarily need to come straight into the house. Set up a bucket of water in your garden patio for the tree to stay in until you wish to invite it into your home \u2013 preferably in a shaded area.\n\nRegardless of when you buy the tree, the next step is vital.\n\nSaw off a few centimetres from the bottom and then shave and peel off around a centimetre of bark from the new base of the tree. \u201cIt\u2019s all about water uptake at the start with your Christmas tree, and the water actually goes up the bark rather than through the wood of the tree, which is a popular misconception,\u201d says Mitchell.\n\nWhether you\u2019re keeping it in the bucket or putting it in a stand, you\u2019ll also want to get it fed from day one. When your tree is cut, it will try to seal itself off to prevent infection \u2013 the feed keeps the pores of the tree open, so that it drinks all the way to Christmas. Feed your tree on the first day and then again on the fifth.\n\nYour Christmas tree stand should have a little vessel so that you can keep it watered. It can drink up to two pints of water a day. If it is continuously gorging itself on your water supply, consider turning the heating down. If you kept it in a bucket of water outside before bringing it in the house then you will not see this level of fast drinking, according to Mitchell.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about sunlight \u2013 a cut tree doesn\u2019t need that to keep it green.\n\nWhat do you do with your Christmas tree at the end of the holidays?\n\nPoor old forgotten Christmas tree Credit: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images Europe More\n\nTraditionally the 12th night after Christmas day (January 6) is the time to get rid of all your decorations, including your tree.\n\n(January 6) is the time to get rid of all your decorations, including your tree.

Go to the Recycle Now website to see how and where to recycle Christmas trees in your local area.\n\nThe pot-grown Christmas tree\n\nWhat if we told you that there was a way to celebrate Christmas forever \u2013 or as long as a tree can feasibly live for?\n\nIf you invest in a potted tree that has been dug up with some of the roots and then placed in a soiled pot, then you\u2019ve basically got your tree sorted for next year without having to barter with any tree dealers anymore. Just take it out of the pot, and replant it in your garden for next year.\n\nHowever, there is one problem with the potted Christmas tree. Left unchecked, they can easily grow to four to five metres in height, which can cause difficulties when trying to land a sleigh in a back garden on Christmas Eve.\n\nFor more Christmas features and gift guides, see www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas", "description": "Did you know that\u00a0Martin Luther\u00a0is said to have invented the modern Christmas tree?\u00a0Legend has it that the scourge of medieval Catholicism had the idea while walking through a forest at night, where the starry night sky was glistening through the trees.
