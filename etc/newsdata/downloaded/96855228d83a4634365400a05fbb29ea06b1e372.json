REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he thinks a trade deal between the United States and China will be signed by the time the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings take place in Chile on Nov. 16 and 17.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He will provide Beijing\u2019s perspective on the progress of the talks in a speech on Saturday, according to a tweet from editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a tabloid published by the People\u2019s Daily of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party.\n\n\u201cI think it will get signed quite easily, hopefully by the summit in Chile, where President Xi and I will both be,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House, without providing details.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with China very well,\u201d Trump also said.\n\nThe White House has announced that China agreed to buy up to $50 billion of U.S. farm products annually, as part of the first phase of a trade deal, although China seems slow to follow through.\n\nThe so-called phase 1 deal was unveiled at the White House last week during a visit by vice premier He as part of a bid to end a tit-for-tat trade war between Beijing and Washington that has roiled markets and hammered global growth. U.S. officials said a second phase of negotiations could address thornier issues like forced technology transfer and non-financial services issues.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he thinks a trade deal between the United States and China will be signed by the time the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings take place in Chile on Nov. 16 and 17.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442479923&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H1S2", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
