Think of this brunch casserole as a one pan, (almost) full English breakfast.\n\nAll it needs is a green salad or some sliced fruit to make it a meal.\n\nAssemble it in the morning, pop it in the fridge and then into the oven when your guests arrive.\n\nReplace the pancetta or bacon with crumbled sausage or chorizo if you like, and add a spoonful of dijon mustard or harissa to the egg mixture for some heat.\n\nTo make it vegetarian, skip the pancetta and instead add long slices of roasted courgette or saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.\n\nAny leftovers make an excellent lunch on Monday.\n\nTomato and bacon brunch casserole\n\nServes 6 generously\n\nAbout 200g of French bread, sliced into 2cm rounds\n\n30g butter, melted\n\n450g beefsteak tomatoes, cored and cut into \u00bdcm slices\n\n200g diced pancetta or smoked streaky bacon\n\n3tbsp chopped chives\n\n50g soft goat\u2019s cheese\n\n10 large eggs, beaten\n\n500ml milk\n\n9x13\u201d / 33 x 23cm baking dish\n\nPreheat oven to 185C\n\nFry the pancetta or bacon until cooked but not crisp. Place the bacon on a piece of paper towel to drain.\n\nLightly brush butter on the inside of the baking dish. Place the sliced bread in the dish, completely covering the bottom. Tear bits off if you need smaller slices to fill in spaces.\n\nBrush the tops of the slices with the remaining butter. Next, add a layer of tomatoes and sprinkle generously with pepper and lightly with salt. Top with the pancetta/bacon, chives and goat\u2019s cheese.\n\nCombine the eggs with the milk and season with salt and pepper. The pancetta/bacon is salty so be generous with the pepper but only add about half a teaspoon of salt.\n\nSlowly pour the liquid over the casserole. Let sit for at least a half an hour. Place in the preheated oven for around 25 minutes \u2013 it should puff up and the egg should be completely cooked in the centre.\n\nRemove, let sit for a few minutes, then slice and serve.\n\n@juliapleonard\u200b", "description": "Brunch is best when there\u2019s no agenda, no timetable, no rush.
