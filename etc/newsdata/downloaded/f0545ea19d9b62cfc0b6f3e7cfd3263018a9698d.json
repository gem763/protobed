I prefer to do that and we have suggested he do that.\n\n\u201cWe can suggest to give his apology, but he is not ready, not in his mind with that situation.\n\n\u201cNow he is devastated, he is upset, he is down, and right now the most important thing is how he is feeling.\u201d\n\nXhaka, Calum Chambers and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang are among the players Emery has left at home for tonight's League Cup tie at Anfield.\n\nMesut Ozil, who has not featured since the win over Nottingham Forest in last round, is in the frame to make his first appearance in a month.", "description": "Xhaka will not play for Arsenal at Liverpool in Wednesday night's Carabao Cup clash at Anfield", "authors": ["Mike Walters", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20753287.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-FC-v-Crystal-Palace-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
