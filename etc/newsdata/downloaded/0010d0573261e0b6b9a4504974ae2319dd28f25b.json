And as is his MO, the media-obsessed president has been fixated on not just the identity of the whistleblower behind the internal complaint that brought this scandal to the fore, but also on who, exactly, has been namelessly feeding intel to the press.\n\nIn the course of casual conversations with advisers and friends, President Trump has privately raised suspicions that a spiteful John Bolton, his notoriously hawkish former national security adviser, could be one of the sources behind the flood of leaks against him, three people familiar with the comments said. At one point, one of those sources recalled, Trump guessed that Bolton was behind one of the anonymous accounts that listed the former national security adviser as one of the top officials most disturbed by the Ukraine-related efforts of Trump and Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney who remains at the center of activities that spurred the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201c[Trump] was clearly implying [it, saying] something to the effect of, \u2018Oh, gee, I wonder who the source on that could be,\u2019\u201d this source said, referring to the president\u2019s speculation. Bolton, for his part, told The Daily Beast last month that allegations that he was a leaker in Trump\u2019s midst are \u201cflatly incorrect.\u201d\n\nThe former national security adviser\u2014who departed the administration last month on awful, mutually bitter terms\u2014is working on a book about his time serving Trump, and has \u201ca lot to dish,\u201d one knowledgeable source noted.\n\nNeither Bolton nor White House spokespeople provided comment for this story. Matt Schlapp, an influential conservative activist with close ties to the White House, said his assumption was that the leaks were coming from \u201ccareer folks inside who hate Trump\u201d and that the president and his campaign had \u201c14 months of this\u201d to come. As for Bolton, Schlapp said, \u201cHe\u2019s smarter than that, although he does aggressively defend himself.\u201d\n\nTrump has felt under siege from within before, including at various flashpoints of his presidency. For instance, near the end of the Mueller probe, the president became so distrustful and resentful toward Don McGahn, his own White House counsel at the time, he started asking those close to him, \u201cIs [Don] wearing a wire?\u201d\n\nBut the current sense that he has been undermined by people whom he brought into his orbit has come at a critical juncture and colored some of the decisions he has made since the whistleblower complaint became public. The president has openly declared that the whistleblower committed an act of treason. He has attempted to stop prominent advisers\u2014including his ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, a man who donated $1 million to his inauguration\u2014from testifying to Congress, only to apparently fail. On Monday, Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former top adviser on Russia and Europe, was on Capitol Hill, where she reportedly told lawmakers that Sondland and Giuliani circumvented the standard national security process on high-profile Ukraine matters. The president has struggled to add to his current legal team, and appeared to begin putting some distance between himself and Giuliani last week.\n\nAnd when outside allies began to talk about constructing a war room to help with impeachment, Trump shot down the concept, in part out of a sense that he couldn\u2019t rely on them to get the message out right. One top White House aide subsequently labeled the idea an exercise by \u201coutside peeps trying to self-aggrandize.\u201d\n\nThe impression left on Republicans is one of a president increasingly driven by paranoia and a desire for insularity\u2014and not, necessarily, to his own benefit.\n\n\u201cThere is a certain level of frustration that all the sudden the president says something, then Rudy does, and it is not always consistent. There is a frustration that not everybody knows what they should be doing. It is not that they can\u2019t defend the president it is a frustration that they don\u2019t know exactly how they are supposed to defend the president,\u201d said John Brabender, a longtime GOP consultant. \u201cFrom the president\u2019s perspective, this whole thing is a witch hunt and is outrageous and, therefore, it shouldn\u2019t even need explanation\u2026But with that said, you can\u2019t just be angry. You need a unified communications team.\u201d\n\nAccording to those who\u2019ve known the president, the sense that a good chunk of the government has never fully accepted his presidency and has actively worked to undermine it has animated much of his activity over the past few weeks. And though they believe he has a point, they also wonder if it is making him functionally incapable of taking the advice of some advisers: to simply ignore impeachment and apply his attention to other facets of governance.\n\nTrump, they add, is preternaturally incapable of ignoring press about him and lingers particularly on leaks that depict atmospherics of his inner sanctum, the West Wing, and his internal well-being.\n\n\u201cIn my experience, what he despises is somebody writing that Donald Trump feels under siege and his emotions are this and his thinking is this,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign aide. \u201cHe hates people saying what he is thinking\u2026 And one of his most frequent tricks in terms of talking about himself on background [as an anonymous source] is him having the reporter say [he is] someone \u2018familiar with the president\u2019s thinking.\u2019\u201d\n\nNunberg said he had yet to see a blind quote in any recent report that would lead him to believe that Trump is cold-calling reporters. But the president is certainly working the fourth estate. Democratic aides were left shaking their heads last week when they received an email from the White House with the subject line, \u201cArticle from President Trump\u201d and a PDF attachment of a Kimberly Strassel Wall Street Journal column.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s apparently so anxious about GOP support in the Senate, he\u2019s taken to sending WSJ columns against the House inquiry,\u201d said a Senate source.\n\nStill, for all of Trump\u2019s grousing and preoccupation with who is and isn\u2019t stabbing him in the back, loyalty has always been a one-way street for this president. Last week, after the news broke that Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Soviet-born businessmen tied to Giuliani, were arrested on charges of violating campaign-finance law, a reporter at the White House asked Trump if the former New York mayor was still his personal attorney. The president responded that he didn\u2019t know.\n\nThough the president would later tweet out his support for Giuliani over the weekend, Trump has a long track record for being loyal to and supportive of a longtime associate, friend, or staffer\u2014up until the moment he\u2019s not. Perhaps the quintessential example of this is that of one of the president\u2019s former attorneys, Michael Cohen, who famously turned on Trump after becoming convinced that the president had abandoned him while he was in the crosshairs of federal prosecutors.\n\nAsked by The Daily Beast last week if the president told him that he still had his lawyer\u2019s back\u2014an attorney who further earned the president\u2019s trust by defending Trump during the Mueller investigation\u2014Giuliani let out a big belly-laugh and responded, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing, [no knife], in my back.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy back feels very comfortable right now,\u201d he added.", "description": "Trump fears the leaks are now coming from the people he chose to serve\u2014and that only increases the paranoia currently infecting the West Wing.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "Sam Stein", "White House Reporter", "Politics Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571103431/191014-swin-trump-snitces-tease_bumoff", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
