His steadily-declining shooting percentages are going to rocket back up. He\u2019s going to break out as an elite player who should have gone No. 1, and not just a guy who gets empty-calorie points.\n\nThat\u2019s what Wiggins is thinking, anyway.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nESPN put out its list of top 100 players in the league and very reasonably did not have Wiggins on it, despite him scoring 18.1 points per game last season. In an excellent job of trying to create a second story out of the 100 list by asking about the \u201csnub,\u201d Wiggins said he isn\u2019t worried about what people say about the four-years, $122 million still on his contract, but he wants to re-establish himself, he told Eric Woodyard of ESPN.\n\n\u201cEveryone is counting pockets. Some people are mad about [it], some people are happy for you,\u201d Wiggins told ESPN. \u201cThat\u2019s how the world goes, especially when you\u2019ve got something they don\u2019t have or do something they don\u2019t do. That\u2019s how the world goes. \u201cEven when I averaged almost 24 points and got the max deal, people were still saying stuff,\u201d he added. \u201cLook at max players and some max players don\u2019t average as much, but it is what it is. I\u2019m just trying to get right, get back on track.\u201d\n\nIf you just shrugged your shoulders, join the rest of the league.\n\nMost Timberwolves fans have moved on from counting Wiggins as the second star to help out Karl-Anthony Towns. Most front office people on other teams have moved on as well, as evidenced by Wiggins\u2019 nonexistent trade value (sources around the league say Minnesota has tested the market only to find no team that wants that contract unless the Timberwolves throw in sweeteners).\n\nStory continues\n\nMinnesota\u2019s new head of basketball operations Gersson Rosas said Wiggins has to be a \u2018main contributor\u2019 if the Timberwolves are going to return to the playoffs. Which is one reason most experts have them missing out.\n\nBut Wiggins believes in himself. Timberwolves fans should expect and want nothing less than that, they just may not want to get their own expectations too high.", "description": "If you just shrugged your shoulders, join the rest of the league.", "authors": ["Kurt Helin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HPvi4GOGy_gctVBdqHtUmw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjMuMTI3MzY0NDM4ODM5OQ--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QKGGouAdTniNOkj7DRZVSg--~B/aD00NDg7dz03OTM7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/003d7f6ef34a26537d524cb9e9bf4b9b", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
