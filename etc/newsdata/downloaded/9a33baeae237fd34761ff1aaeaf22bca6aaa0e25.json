Kornmesser)\n\nSince then, 4,000 other exoplanets have been found and numerous more projects are planned to search for more exoplanets.\n\nQueloz now has more than 100 celestial objects named after him.\n\n\"We opened a new window in astrophysics - we demonstrated that there are other planets like the ones we have orbiting our solar system,\" he said.\n\nSearching for life on exoplanets is formally part of the research agendas of both NASA and the European Space Agency.\n\nLast month the discovery of water on a \"super-Earth\" planet known as K2-18b caused scientists to speculate that it could feasibly support life.", "description": "Didier Queloz is \"convinced\" we are not alone in the universe", "authors": ["Sophie Curtis", "Image", "Upi", "Barcroft Media", "Collection Mix", "Subjects Rm", "Esa Hubble Eso M.
