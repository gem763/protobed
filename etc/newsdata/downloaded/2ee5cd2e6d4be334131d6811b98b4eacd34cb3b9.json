Um yeah, I know. It's wild. But there is some backstory here, so stay with me.\n\nThe soon-to-be married Brits are naturists, which Dictionary.com defines as people \"who appreciate the beauty and benefits of nature\" and are also \"nudist(s).\" In an ad on Bark.com, either the bride or the groom inquired after \"people out there who are comfortable in their own skin or are naturists too\" to be a part of their wedding day.\n\nThe ad made it clear that they were pretty desperate for help: \"We\u2019ve been let down by three sets of people so far, with the last ones initially agreeing and then as the day nears pulling out at the last minute, it\u2019s an incredibly stressful situation when all we want is for our wedding be 100% authentic.\"\n\nThey obviously knew it'd be high-key hard to find people who were actually willing to serve drinks and food in their birthday suits at a formal event, but the pair seemed insistent on doing it their way. \"We had previously considered having clothed staff, but we do not feel comfortable in the presence of clothed people,\" they wrote, \"so why would we want to feel uncomfortable on the most special day of our lives?\" Well, when you put it like that...\n\nSo, if you want to lend a hand (and/or your naked bod) to these lovebirds, respond to their ad. Did I mention the gig pays ~$38 an hour and you'll only be serving 30 people? Why not make that bread and witness the magic of loving unity all while feeling super free?\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Here comes the bride, all dressed in...nothing.", "authors": ["Megan Uy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TCD2ySKlKcioau.6dXkzYQ--~B/aD01MTI7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/delish_597/2d28306e8fced5cd5d520b842073578e", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
