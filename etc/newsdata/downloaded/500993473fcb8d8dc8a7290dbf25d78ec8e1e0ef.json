Van Rooyen filled in as head coach during de Bruin's absence.\n\nVan Rooyen has been part of the Lions' backroom staff since 2009, most recently as head of strength and conditioning.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based Lions made three straight Super Rugby finals from 2016-18 but lost all three. De Bruin was coach when they lost last year. The Lions finished ninth in the standings this season and missed out on the playoffs.\n\nVan Rooyen says \"we have a young but dynamic team and a blank canvas. It is up to us what we make of it.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "JOHANNESBURG (AP) - The Lions Super Rugby team has appointed Ivan van Rooyen, its former fitness chief, as new head coach.Van Rooyen replaces Swys de Bruin,...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
