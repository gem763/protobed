The relative quiet came after a volatile day for European stocks on Thursday, when the ECB launched a long-awaited package of stimulus measures, including an interest-rate cut and a renewed program of bond purchases, known as quantitative easing.\n\nMoritz Sterzinger, a director at financial-advisory firm JCRA, flagged concerns that further quantitative easing might have limited impact on growth and inflation, given that interest rates are in negative territory.\n\nHe questioned: \"How big are the diminishing returns to monetary stimulus, and how effective are additional rate cuts and another round of quantitative easing going to be in terms of stimulating the economy?\"\n\nThe ECB also set plans on Thursday for a new two-tiered system for charging interest on the deposits held by eurozone banks, in an effort to ease some of the losses lenders face as rates dip further into negative territory. The central bank set up an updated lending program.\n\nAnalysts at Rabobank said the new measures are good news for banks and \"unequivocally positive\" for those in the periphery of the eurozone in particular.\n\nAmong the biggest gainers in Europe on Friday were Italy's Unione di Banche Italiane, known as UBI Banca, which was up 2.5%, Germany's Commerzbank, up 3.7%, and Spain's CaixaBank, which gained 4.6%. The Stoxx Europe 600's banking sector climbed 1.8%.\n\nThe yield on 10-year Italian government bonds ticked up to 0.917% from 0.8437% on Thursday, while the yield on the equivalent German bund rose to minus 0.496% from minus 0.517%.\n\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys rose to 1.799%, from 1.789% on Thursday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nIn Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rallied 1% and Japan's Nikkei was up 1.1%. Markets in China, Korea and Taiwan were closed for a holiday.\n\nOn the trade front, The Wall Street Journal reported Beijing was making efforts to narrow the scope of negotiations with the U.S., separating issues like national security that have held up the talks. That came after President Trump on Wednesday postponed new tariffs that were set to be imposed on $250 billion of Chinese imports from Oct. 1.\n\nIn currencies, the British pound climbed 0.9% against the U.S. dollar, a day after local papers reported that the Democratic Unionist Party had suggested it would accept Northern Ireland keeping some European Union rules in place after Brexit, which could ease a major sticking point.\n\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of its peers, slipped 0.3%.\n\nLater in the day, investors will be watching for fresh retail sales data from the U.S., as well as a measure of consumer confidence. Economists forecast retail sales grew 0.2% in August, after ticking up 0.7% in July.\n\nWrite to Avantika Chilkoti at Avantika.Chilkoti@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 13, 2019 06:20 ET (10:20 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
