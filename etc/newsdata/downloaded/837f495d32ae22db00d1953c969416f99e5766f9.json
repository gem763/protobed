The decision by Moody\u2019s to downgrade Ford\u2019s credit rating is comparable to what happens to a car buyer whose credit score drops.\n\nThe 2 Big Reasons Ford Stock Looks Good on This Dip More\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com\n\nThat\u2019s just what happened.\n\nAs Ford\u2019s second-quarter earnings report made clear, in June it had almost $91 billion in long-term Ford Credit loans meant to help buyers pay for Ford cars. $50.5 billion of Ford Credit debt, presumably dealer loans, will mature within one year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut the Moody\u2019s report attacked the business for weak cash generation as it pursues a costly restructuring program.\n\nWhat\u2019s really going on?\n\nIs it the Cars or the Buyers?\n\nThe \u201ctell\u201d here is that Moody\u2019s also called Ford\u2019s outlook \u201cstable,\u201d noting it has $23 billion in cash and under $12 billion in \u201cautomotive debt\u201d taken out for the company. Rather than operate a separate loan operation, Ford carries Ford Credit, based in Omaha, as a subsidiary. Banks expect some loans to go bad, holding reserves against which losses are charged off. Ford Credit isn\u2019t operating that way.\n\nIn 2002, Ford sold its Brazilian loan portfolio to a local bank for $430 million. That bank then issued more loans to buyers on its own account to boost Ford\u2019s market share. Handing loans to buyers as debt is controversial. If the portfolio isn\u2019t properly managed it can generate huge losses in an economic downturn. A recession would be a double whammy for Ford\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nBut Ford Credit also provides valuable data to its parent company. One-third of its profit now comes from data, up from one-fourth just two years ago. Ford recently bought a small electric scooter startup, Spin, mainly for the data.\n\nThe Reinvention of Ford\n\nMeanwhile, the reinvention of Ford continues.\n\nMost reporters highlight the $11.1 billion investment Ford is making in electric and self-driving cars. But that also means it\u2019s retreating from its traditional business. About 10% of Ford\u2019s white-collar office staff was recently let go. Job cuts are coming in Europe, South America and Russia.\n\nFord is focusing its internal combustion efforts on big trucks and SUVs, which continue to sell in the U.S., while pushing EVs in Europe. The company hopes to get half its European sales from hybrids and EVs within three years.\n\nFord is working closely with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) on electric vehicles. Volkswagen in turn is pushing the modular electric drive matrix (MEB) platform, building its first MEB-based factory in China. This is a single platform that works across all car models and lowers costs. Sharing that development expense with other car companies cuts costs further.\n\nFord isn\u2019t putting all its eggs in Volkswagen\u2019s basket. It has also invested in Rivian, an electric truck startup. The company has also invested in Argo AI for autonomous car technology. Its latest Michigan factory is expected to produce semi-autonomous vehicles within two years.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Ford Stock\n\nAs a stock, Ford is strictly for income investors. The 15 cent per share dividend yields over 6.3% at a time when long-term U.S. bonds yield just 2.3%.\n\nAs a company, however, Ford is currently highly speculative. It\u2019s trying to figure out the new worlds of electric and self-driving cars while acknowledging the sunset of its old business models. Profits are expected to come from new directions and its winding up its old ways of doing business.\n\nElectric and self-driving cars filled with data excite Ford. They scare Moody\u2019s.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.
