He said that the car\u2019s tyres were slashed and the paint scratched off the body, Swedish newspaper Expressen reports.\n\n\u201cI had had dinner with my mum. Then I parked the car at home to leave some stuff. After 30 minutes, I went down to drive my mum home, and then I see that the paint is torn and that there are holes in the tyres, \u201d he said, noting that the attack was the same as a previous incident earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI had the car for ten days. I got it back from the last workshop last week, where it had been repainted after last time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating that my stuff can\u2019t be left in peace. I have to change the car \u2014 I can\u2019t have this car \u2014 and I probably have to move. That\u2019s the reality,\u201d he added.\n\nSwedish Populist Politician\u2019s Home Targeted In Arson Attack https://t.co/QqsgimhWAA \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 25, 2018\n\nBali garnered support on social media from many followers including Sweden\u2019s leading terrorism expert Magnus Ranstorp, who called the incidents \u201cvery serious\u201d.\n\nCar burnings and property damage against conservatives and populists who come out against mass migration have become increasingly common. In Sweden, several members of the populist Sweden Democrats have seen their homes attacked including one attempt of arson in Stockholm.\n\nIn Germany, the Alternative for Germany (AFD) has recorded hundreds of incidents of violence and vandalism against their members and supporters over the years. In 2016, vandals set fire to former party leader Frauke Petry\u2019s car.\n\nThe level of violence \u2014 with far-left Antifa extremists taking much of the credit \u2014 has dramatically increased in the last few years. Earlier this year, there was an attempted assassination on an AfD politician, and the bombing of an office of Matteo Salvini\u2019s League last August in Italy.\n\nDenmark Introduces Permanent Border Controls with Sweden Due to Gang Violence https://t.co/JNjQkevg1o \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 13, 2019", "description": "Swedish Moderate Party MP Hanif Bali, an outspoken critic of mass migration, said he might have to move house after his car was vandalised.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/04/baliscreenshotyoutube-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
