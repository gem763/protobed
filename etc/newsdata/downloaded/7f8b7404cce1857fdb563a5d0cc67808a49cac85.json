But on Friday, The New York Times and other outlets reported that the Trump administration is considering barring Chinese companies from listing on U.S. exchanges.\n\nIn a newly released interview, taped in June, former Cisco (CSCO) CEO John Chambers said his \u201cgood friends\u201d in Silicon Valley have praised President Donald Trump for confronting the issue of trade with China, but Chambers lightly criticized the execution of the strategy.\n\n\u201cSeveral of my good friends said that, at least finally a president is taking the issue on squarely,\u201d Chambers says. \u201cIt surprised me because when I'm at dinners with startups and larger companies in the Valley, most of them believe this issue had to be dealt with.\u201d\n\n\u201cBringing it to the attention, it wasn't a very gentle landing. And we'll see if we get landed, but I think it needed to be a firmness,\u201d he adds.\n\nOn Thursday, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce confirmed the purchase of \u201cconsiderable\u201d amounts of pork and soybeans from U.S. producers ahead of senior-level talks on October 10. Don\u2019t expect a breakthrough anytime soon, Chambers said.\n\n\u201cThe relationship with China is going to continue to be tough for a while,\u201d Chambers says. \u201cI personally believe it's in both countries' best interests to work through it and get back to a win-win ... But the issues had to be addressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can't be win-lose in today's world,\u201d he adds.\u201cYou can't ask one country to do something and not expect the other country to be fair in the exchange.\u201d\n\nChambers made the comments during a conversation that aired in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.\n\nFor a decade, Chambers ran internet hardware company Cisco, growing the business to yearly revenue of nearly $50 billion. He\u2019s currently the CEO of the firm JC2 Ventures, where he funds and advises startups. He also guides Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron on how to make their countries favorable to startups.\n\nThe American Chamber of Commerce in China conducted a survey in May of almost 250 member companies that found about 75% reported that the increase of U.S. and China tariffs has negatively affected their business.\n\nNEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 20, 2016 : John Chambers, Executive Chairman, Cisco participates in a panel discussion during the annual Clinton Global Initiative on September 20, 2016 in New York City.

Two days after the tweet, he said he was having \u201csecond thoughts\u201d about the escalation of trade tensions.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office later confirmed that the Trump administration would move forward with the tariff increase on $300 billion worth of goods set to be taxed in September.\n\nAdditional tariffs on the $250 in goods are set to go into effect on Oct. 15, five days after the next scheduled talks; and tariffs on some of the $300 billion in goods took effect on Sept. 1 and the remaining goods will be subject to tariffs beginning on Dec. 15.\n\nAndy Serwer is editor-in-chief of Yahoo Finance.
