Kamala Harris currently lead the Democratic primary field in CHC endorsements with three apiece.\n\n\u201cI know for a fact that if Biden doesn\u2019t get elected in the primary next year, we\u2019re gonna have Trump as a president again,\u201d said Gonzalez, who switched his endorsement earlier this month from Juli\u00e1n Castro to Biden.\n\nMorning Score Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

California Sen. Kamala Harris has also requested a meeting but has yet to meet with the caucus, members said.\n\n\u201cHe was the first one that really made the effort to come and speak to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to address our concerns and look for support, and he was way out there early. And I think that was important,\u201d Correa said.\n\nIn the meeting with the group, Biden made his case for why he\u2019s the candidate best positioned to defeat Trump next November. He also took questions and pledged to pursue immigration reform, one of the Hispanic Caucus\u2019s top issues.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Aside from goodwill toward Castro, many had local concerns to consider: Nearly three-quarters of CHC members are concentrated in four states \u2014 California, Texas, New Jersey and New York \u2014 and each of those states has or had at least one candidate in the 2020 hunt.\n\nAs a result, many of those who have endorsed \u2014 roughly a third of the caucus \u2014 have tended to support home-state hopefuls. Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s two CHC endorsements, for example, come from fellow New Jersey lawmakers: Sen. Robert Menendez and Rep. Albio Sires. Two of Harris\u2019 three endorsements come from her home state.\n\nCastro\u2019s only supporter now that Gonzalez switched to Biden is his brother Joaquin.\n\nBiden allies suggest it\u2019s only a matter of time before some members who remained loyal to home-state candidates come out publicly for the former vice president.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very lucky to have the support that we have now,\u201d said a Biden campaign official. \u201cBut that\u2019s just the beginning. There\u2019s a significant effort underway to get more support, and we expect to see that fairly soon.\u201d\n\nThe Castro brothers, for their part, have not pressed hard within the CHC for endorsements.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro (right) and Rep. Joaquin Castro have not pressed hard within the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for endorsements. | Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had any, like, strong-arming or, \u2018Please support my brother\u2019\u201d from Joaquin Castro, said one member requested anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cNothing like that. I think generally speaking, he\u2019s been very respectful of members who\u2019ve already chosen a candidate.\u201d\n\nBut Juli\u00e1n\u2019s failure to take off, nine months after announcing his bid, has left many anxious to choose sides.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re staying loyal. It\u2019s just a matter of what\u2019s the breaking point,\u201d Vela said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very clear to me that with respect to members who are [supporting their state\u2019s candidate], the vice president is by far the next choice of most of these members.\u201d\n\nBiden, however, is not a universal choice. Asked about the effort inside the Hispanic Caucus to get members to coalesce around his candidacy, Rep. Chuy Garcia (D-Ill.) said, \u201cSome of us are kind of concerned\u201d about the early push to support the former vice president.\n\nGarcia said it would be tough for all 38 members to rally behind a single candidate. But he acknowledged that \u201cit means something\u201d if a group of members can organize in favor of a candidate.\n\nGarcia, who endorsed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016, said he\u2019s still weighing his options for 2020 but might be ready to endorse someone after the October debate. A dozen candidates have qualified for the stage.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m wanting him to be impactful, to shine,\u201d Garcia said of Castro. \u201cIn the times we live in with this administration in place, I think it\u2019s especially important that someone who is of Latino heritage do well.\u201d\n\nRep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) acknowledged that \u201cthere\u2019s a natural inclination to support\u201d Castro given that he\u2019s the single Latino candidate. He noted Castro was the only candidate to speak at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute\u2019s annual gala earlier this month.\n\nBut Espaillat is still weighing his options \u2014 he has met with several candidates, including Biden; Sanders; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/2607/1155968404_6085815684001_6085813667001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nWhile Juli\u00e1n Castro has shined in some debate moments, his tough criticism of Biden since this month\u2019s debate appears to have rubbed many Democrats \u2014 including some in the CHC \u2014 the wrong way.\n\n\u201cDuring the last debate when he took a couple of shots at Biden, I think that hurt him more than helped him. And I\u2019ve heard that from a number of sources,\u201d Correa said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not gonna mention who, but a lot of people felt that Mr. Castro I think hit a little bit below the belt with some of his comments.\u201d\n\nMore important are widespread concerns that, deep into the primary calendar, Castro is not getting enough traction.\n\n\u201cI want to see him in as long as possible,\u201d said Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), who hasn\u2019t endorsed a candidate yet. \u201cHaving Juli\u00e1n in the race to add the perspective from the community is vital to remind people that Latinos come from all different backgrounds.\u201d\n\nBut Gomez added that he\u2019s keeping an eye on the electability and viability of the candidates \u2014 particularly with regard to fundraising.\n\n\u201cI wish Juli\u00e1n had more resources to put a more robust campaign structure and I think he\u2019s trying to stay in the game, but he has a tough hill to climb,\u201d he said.\n\nCastro warned supporters last week that he won\u2019t be able to stay in the race if he doesn\u2019t qualify for November\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t say this lightly,\u201d he wrote in a fundraising email Thursday. \u201cIf I don\u2019t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/38/ab/ec9cb18c45089447ede301a0211e/20190929-joe-biden-nevada-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
