REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe system combines data on clients\u2019 banking activities, with public data on company ownership and directorships, to flag desirable potential clients to HSBC staff and offer ways to connect to them through existing relationships.\n\nUsing data and artificial intelligence to try and boost revenues is part of HSBC\u2019s broader push to squeeze more out of its large physical network and client data, a key priority for interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the first commercial uses of investment in financial crime prevention, and the business we\u2019re getting in this way is inherently lower risk and quicker to win,\u201d said Stuart Nivison, HSBC\u2019s global head of client network banking.\n\nHSBC declined to comment on how much it expects to make from the new system but said the broader \u2018network income\u2019 initiative has already yielded hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue.\n\nThe drive is an important part of the bank\u2019s efforts to defend its global presence at a time when some analysts and investors are saying it should shrink or exit markets like the United States where it makes returns below its cost of capital.\n\nHSBC was forced to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in financial crime compliance as part of a $1.9 billion settlement in 2012 with U.S. authorities over the bank\u2019s failure to prevent money laundering by drug cartels though its Mexican unit.\n\nThe system works by mapping individual customers\u2019 and companies ties to each other and then looking for unusual patterns of transactions or unearthing previously unknown connections between those entities.\n\nThat system has already freed up more than 400 staff to go from manually checking transactions and records to client-facing roles where they can spend time helping customers, said Adrian Rigby, chief operating officer of HSBC\u2019s trade business.\n\nHSBC\u2019s Nivison said the lightbulb moment was realizing the tool could be repurposed to look for \u2018green flags\u2019 of attractive potential clients rather than \u2018red flags\u2019 of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cWe took our customer dataset and combined it with (Britain\u2019s) Companies House data and turned the algorithm around to look for attractiveness in a client, whether that be through sector, growth of the company, and connection to existing clients,\u201d Nivison said.\n\nThe tool has mapped 22.5 million entities and people in Britain, and can identify in three minutes a network of connections that a staff member would have taken three hours to map out manually, he said.", "description": "British bank HSBC has converted a financial crime-spotting algorithm it was forced to build in the wake of a money-laundering scandal into one that can scope out new business opportunities, bank executives said.", "authors": ["Lawrence White", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434515039&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0TE-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
