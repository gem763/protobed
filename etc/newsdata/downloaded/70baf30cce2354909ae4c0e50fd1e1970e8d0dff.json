She was born in Peterborough but has lived in Littlehampton for the majority of her life, having chosen to stick around as it\u2019s a \u2018beautiful, peaceful town\u2019.\n\nShe pays \u00a3625 a month (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHi, Adelaide! How much do you pay to live here?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rent is \u00a3625 a month.\n\nThe water costs \u00a330 a month. This flat doesn\u2019t have gas so I don\u2019t have to worry about that. The electric is pay as you go so I usually put about \u00a340 a month on it.\n\nAnd what do you get for what you pay?\n\nWe have five rooms \u2013 two are bedrooms, one bathroom, a kitchen, and a lounge.\n\nDo you think you have a good deal?\n\nYes, this is the cheapest two-bedroom flat I could find in the area and it has nothing wrong with it!\n\nAdelaide has lived in Littlehampton for most of her life (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHow did you find the flat?\n\nI saw it advertised in an estate agent\u2019s window.\n\nI\u2019ve been here for about five months. Before here we lived in a shared house so it\u2019s a relief to finally have some privacy.\n\nDo you like where you live?\n\nOur home is in a small seaside town called Littlehampton. I live near the town, beach and a train station, so it\u2019s really convenient.\n\nI like it because there\u2019s lots of space, it\u2019s near a lot of local amenities.\n\nThis flat also has a lot of character, including a Juliet balcony.\n\nShe likes how peaceful the seaside town is (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHow have you made the flat feel like home?\n\nI\u2019ve bought a lot of quirky ornaments to make it seem more homely.\n\nAre there any issues with the flat?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo.\n\nDo you have plans to move again?\n\nNo, as at the moment as I\u2019m very happy here.\n\nAnd what about buying a place?\n\nI do not have enough money.\n\nFair point. Shall we have a look around?\n\nSo here\u2019s the entryway (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThe living room (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAdelaide has only lived here for five months, having previously rented in a houseshare (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThat might be why things look a bit sparse (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nBut Adelaide has added plenty of ornaments to make the flat feel like home (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThe kitchen (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nA clock themed around food and tea? We\u2019re into it (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nWho doesn\u2019t want a rainbow butter dish? (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nGotta have fridge magnets (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAdelaide\u2019s bedroom (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nWe think Adelaide likes pink (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nOh hey, Audrey (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nOh hi, pink bunny (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThe second room is the baby\u2019s (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nBig fan of the sharks (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\n(Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThe bathroom (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nYes, there\u2019s a tub (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAnd finally, the toothbrushes \u2013 complete with a shark (Picture: Scott Ramsey/Metro.co.uk)\n\nWhat I Rent is a weekly series that\u2019s out every Tuesday at 10am. Check back next week to have a nose around another rented property.\n\nHow to get involved in What I Rent What I Rent is Metro.co.uk's weekly series that takes you inside the places people are renting, to give us all a better sense of what's normal and how much we should be paying.
