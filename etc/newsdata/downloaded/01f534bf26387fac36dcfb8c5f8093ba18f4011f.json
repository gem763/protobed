Are we clear?\"\n\nThe teams ran to the same tunnel together after the flag was thrown, but there weren't any noticeable scuffles as OU players bunched up while the Longhorns went single file up the ramp.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: and", "description": "DALLAS (AP) \u2014 The entire teams for No. 6 Oklahoma and 11th-ranked Texas were issued an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty 30 minutes before the annual Red River rivalry, meaning any player getting flagged for the same thing during the game will be ejected.", "authors": ["Schuyler Dixon", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
