Bill Pulte is using it to give away money.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe 31-year-old from Oakland County, Michigan, is no stranger to wealth: His family founded the PulteGroup in 1950, a home-building giant now worth just shy of $10 billion.\n\nFor the past several months, Pulte has been using his wealth for good \u2014 giving away thousands at a time to those in need, even catching the attention of President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cTHANK YOU BILL!\u201d the president tweeted in July, responding to Pulte vowing to give away $30,000 to a U.S. Veteran if President Trump retweeted him.\n\nBut Pulte says his goodwill isn\u2019t all for recognition. Instead, it\u2019s about a deeper urge to connect.\n\n\u201cIt's about time we use social media for good,\" he told FOX Business.\n\nVitriol seems to be much louder on the Internet than positivity, Pulte explained but said he desperately wanted to change that.\n\n\u201cI'm a wealthy individual who understands technology better than somebody in an older generation, and I thought, \u2018Why aren't we bringing philanthropy online?\u2019\u201d\n\nHis original goal was to give away $100,000 by the end of the year. He later raised that bar to $1 million. \u201cIf we use Twitter, we can instantly take care of whoever is suffering the most anywhere in the United States,\u201d Pulte said.\n\nWe're helping people in most immediate need. - Bill Pulte to FOX Business\n\nAnd though he comes from a wealthy family, Pulte isn\u2019t using his inheritance to give away. He\u2019s using his own money, and he\u2019s using the internet to crowdsource from others, too.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % PHM PULTE CORPORATION 36.50 -0.05 -0.14%\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t know this, and it\u2019s not necessarily worth me convincing them, but I actually became wealthy independent of my grandfather and independent of my family,\u201d Pulte told The Detroit Free Press. He owns a private-equity firm that buys and runs building companies. \u201cThe great majority of my wealth is money that I earned on my own.\u201d\n\nStill, the philanthropist said it's going to take a lot of people to allow the movement to be sustainable.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"Not just one, two or 10 people. One person, like me \u2026 can't make a big impact. But if I can inspire others to be giving, to the tune of hundreds of thousands of people, that's when we can really start to move the needle.\u201d\n\nTo decide where to donate, Pulte said, he has \u201can army of volunteers\u201d who help him do the vetting. They scour the web to find those in need, using popular funding websites like GoFundMe to discover and contribute to already-existing campaigns.\n\n\u201cWe try to do as much homework as we can,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you also try to rely on the good faith of people. And sometimes that means that we're going to be a victim [of scams].\u201d But \u201ceven if 90 percent of [the people we help] are real, at least we're helping 90 percent.\u201d\n\nWhen the team finds a new recipient, the transfer of funds is almost instant. That\u2019s because, much like their approach to using Twitter to scout recipients, their approach to actually giving away the money is digital, using mobile services like Cash App.\n\nSo far, Pulte and his team have raised money for the family of a young girl killed in a car accident, for a life-saving $2 million drug that helped save an infant\u2019s life, to save a 106-year-old woman from eviction \u201cand we've helped a number of veterans.\u201d\n\nThe response, Pulte said, has been great.\n\n\u201cAND THIS RIGHT HERE FOLKS IS WHY I JOINED THIS AMAZING TEAM & MOVEMENT,\u201d one Twitter user said. \u201cI HAD NO IDEA WHERE MY LIFE WAS HEADED JUST A FEW SHORT MONTHS AGO!!! THANKS FOR ALL THE FAITH, HOPE & LOVE TO ME & MY 3 CHILDREN!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no doubt that @pulte's actions are the reality that will change our world,\" another user from East Africa said. \u201cMay God Bless him and his team. Much love and respect from Uganda, East Africa.\u201d\n\nAnd another user who received $500 said, \u201cOh my gosh!!!!!!! I'm literally shaking right now that I cant type this!!! This couldn't have came at a better time thank you so much @pulte and #twitterphilanthropy this group has done wonders for me, I have made new friends & restored my faith in humanity love you all.\u201d\n\nTo date, Pulte has given away more than $100,000 of his own money \u2014 and he doesn\u2019t plan to stop any time soon.\n\n\u201cI think giving to other people is a lifelong mission,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm very excited to see how this whole thing is going to unfold over the coming years. We\u2019ve got a lot of momentum.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "\u201cIt's about time we use social media for good,\" Bill Pulte told FOX Business.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
