Bob Bromage told news outlets Monday that the family was walking along Fripp Island when they spotted the trash bag-wrapped package floating in the water. They dragged it onto the beach and lugged it to their rental in a golf cart, later slicing it open to discover bricks of white powder. At that point, they figured they'd better call police.\n\nAuthorities assessed the cocaine's value at more than $600,000. Officials are working to determine its origin.\n\nBromage said narcotics don't frequently wash up in the county. He thinks Hurricane Dorian may have pushed it ashore.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
