must approve an extension to the transition period\n\nThe withdrawal agreement provides for the transition period to be extended by agreement by up to two years, to the end of 2022. The decision to extend must be agreed by the end of June 2020.\n\nThe bill gives parliament a say if the UK government decides to ask for an extension. But many MPs are worried that Boris Johnson wouldn\u2019t ask for one, opening a \u201ctrapdoor\u201d to a delayed no-deal Brexit if there is no trade deal with the EU in place by the end of 2020.\n\nSo expect an amendment, if the WAB passes second reading, along the lines of the Benn Act, to require the government to seek an extension to the transition period if a trade deal has not been negotiated by December 2020.\n\nProtection of workers\u2019 rights seems weak\n\nThere is a section about workers\u2019 rights in the non-binding political declaration that accompanies the withdrawal agreement. The withdrawal agreement requires the UK government to negotiate the long-term trade deal with the EU on the basis of the political declaration, and the WAB says that, if ministers propose to reduce standards of worker protection below EU standards, they have to make a statement to parliament saying so. No, that is not exactly a copper-bottomed guarantee.\n\nEqually, if the EU legislates for new workers\u2019 rights, the government must report to parliament, saying whether it intends to match them.\n\nParliament will have a say over trade deal negotiations\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It says ministers may not engage in negotiations unless a statement of objectives has been approved by the House of Commons, and that ministers \u201cmust seek to achieve\u201d those objectives.\n\nThe bill authorises payment of the exit settlement\n\nIt does not say how much it is, not least because that will depend on whether the transition period is extended or not. It was widely reported as \u00a339bn, but changing exchange rates reduced it a bit, and delaying Brexit since March meant we carried on paying contributions as a member state, and will pay less for a shorter transition period.\n\nThere is a \u2018parliamentary sovereignty\u2019 clause\n\nThe bill includes a clause that begins: \u201cIt is recognised that the parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign.\u201d This is persiflage designed to keep the sillier Eurosceptics happy. They do not like the continuing application of EU law during the transition period, or the eight-year phase-out of European Court of Justice jurisdiction over some EU citizenship questions.\n\nThe final vote on the bill will be conclusive\n\nThe bill replaces the need for a separate \u201cmeaningful\u201d vote by parliament on whether to leave the EU. It also overrides the provision in the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 for a 21-day cooling-off period before approving an international treaty (which is what the withdrawal agreement is).\n\nThat means that the final vote in the Commons on the bill will be the conclusive one. That will probably be the vote on third reading, which Boris Johnson wants to happen on Thursday, but it may well be later if the government loses control of the timetable \u2013 and there could still be votes after that if the House of Lords passes amendments, which the Commons would then have to consider.", "description": "MPs will be voting this evening on whether they support the principle of the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill, known as the WAB, to take us out of the European Union.
