Fewer than 100 remain open for business.\n\nHowever, 10,000 miles away, in Australia, another store called Kmart is thriving.\n\nThe only problem? The two department stores have nothing to do with each other.\n\nFew Americans are likely aware that Kmart has a doppelganger in the land Down Under. As it turns out, an Australian chain called Kmart sports the same name and practically the same \"red K\" branding as the once beloved American retailer, yet the two companies are completely unrelated.\n\nThis Australian Kmart, owned by the conglomerate Wesfarmers Limited, operates 231 department stores across the continent. The chain once had a licensing agreement with the Sears Holdings Corporation allowing it to use the store's name, but in 2017, the Australian company acquired the brand name in the region for $100 million, according to its annual report.\n\nInterestingly, Wesfarmers is the same company behind Target \u2014 the Australian retailer that, just like Kmart, has nothing to do with the American store bearing the same name and nearly identical branding.\n\nRead more: There's an Australian store called Target that has nothing to do with the American one \u2014 and the Australian one is way better\n\nAs an American college student studying abroad in Sydney, Australia, I wanted to see what this Australian Kmart had to offer.\n\nHere's what it was like inside Australia's version of a Kmart.", "description": "Despite having the same name and similar branding, the two Kmarts have nothing to do with each other.", "authors": ["Carrigan English"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d97a5e2d831b215897494b1?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
