Here are key details from Thursday's Commerce Department report:\n\n--Purchases of newly built single-family homes fell 0.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 701,000 in September from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a sales pace of 709,000 in September.\n\n--The number of new homes for sale in September would last 5.5 months at the current pace, down from 6.4 a year earlier.\n\n--The median sale price of a new home in September was $299,400, which was down from last year, when the sale price was $328,300.\n\n--Sales data can be volatile and subject to revisions. The September decrease in new-home sales carried a margin of error of plus or minus 16.1 percentage point. Sales in August were revised down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 706,000 from an initial estimate of 713,000.\n\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 10:15 ET (14:15 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
