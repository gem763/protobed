But the U.K. is still in the EU.\n\nWhy it matters to the market: \"It can be said that Powell thinks there will not be any reason to ease again in the short or medium term, but that he can be convinced to ease if things don\u2019t go right,\" Brien added.\n\nPowell's view seems to reflect that of the market, as stocks have jumped to new all-time highs this week and Treasury yields have risen to their highest level in months, with the yield curve steepening.\n\nAnd with Powell's assurances that the Fed will be there to cut rates further should things get worse, the market is feeling confident.\n\nBetween the lines: Rick Rieder, BlackRock\u2019s CIO of global fixed income, asserts that the Fed's policy rate is now just right and \"delivering a very powerful dose of the 'right stuff' from a policy perspective.\"", "description": "BlackRock's CIO says Fed's policy rate is now just right", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/uyL9Yeu7XJY9rZ9ChUoSk1jyc48=/0x291:4928x3063/1920x1080/2019/10/30/1572471510195.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
