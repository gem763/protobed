Malvo was convicted of capital murder in the D.C. sniper shootings but is seeking to have his life sentences revisited because he was a juvenile. (Rich Lipski/The Washington Post)\n\nOne evening in February 2002, a 21-year-old single mother named Keenya Cook was making dinner and taking care of her six-month-old daughter when the doorbell rang at her Tacoma, Wash., home. When Cook answered, 16-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo shot her in the face, killing her. Shortly after his first murder, Malvo threw up.\n\nHe had shot the wrong target. On orders from his mentor, John Allen Muhammad, Malvo was supposed to shoot Isa Farrington Nichols, Cook\u2019s aunt, who had supported Muhammad\u2019s ex-wife in the custody battle over their children. The slaying orphaned Cook\u2019s daughter, devastated her family and ended Nichols\u2019 marriage. But Nichols, and some other victims of the D.C. sniper rampage 17 years ago, are supporting Malvo\u2019s bid to be resentenced for his life without parole term, which will be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday as the latest chapter in the high court\u2019s evolving reconsideration of how to handle juveniles in the criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cThis is not about him being released,\u201d Nichols said, knowing that even reducing Malvo\u2019s ten life sentences would not lead to his freedom. \u201cThe first time I heard it, I was like, \u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019 This was someone sent to my door to kill me. But as I listened more and more, I understood the totality of what\u2019s involved, and the other families involved in youths sentenced to life without parole...I believe there\u2019s a bigger picture here. This is something that needs to be done.\"\n\nNot all victims want to see Malvo\u2019s case reopened. Nelson Rivera, whose wife Lori Lewis Rivera, 25, was killed by the snipers in Kensington, Md., joined an amicus brief filed by the Maryland Crime Victims\u2019 Resource Center which said the rulings clearing the way for Malvo\u2019s resentencing \u201cre-traumatize, revictimize, and violate the legal and human rights of victims.\u201d The center\u2019s lawyer, Victor Stone, said that \u201cpeople like Mr. Rivera lost a really important family member.\u201d Ordering new hearings \u201cputs a tremendous burden and revictimization on victims\u2019 families who struggle with that loss. They spent years trying to resume a normal life. The lack of finality to them, that is really something,\u201d particularly if they must relive the trauma in new hearings.\n\n\n\nSniper survivor Paul LaRuffa, who was shot at close range by Lee Boyd Malvo in 2002, now supports Malvo's bid for resentencing after the Supreme Court ruled that juvenile defendants should not receive mandatory life sentences. (MARVIN JOSEPH/TWP/TWP)\n\nAfter Cook\u2019s slaying in Washington state, Malvo and Muhammad shot at least 21 more people around the country, killing 14 of them, including 10 homicides in the Washington area in a three-week rampage in October 2002 which terrorized the D.C. region and mesmerized the world. The pair were arrested near Frederick, Md., and prosecuted in Virginia in 2003, where capital punishment was still an option for juveniles. Muhammad was sentenced to death, but Malvo\u2019s jury chose a life sentence without parole rather than death for the Jamaican teen, who was 17 at the time of the sniper shootings. He then entered pleas to two additional Virginia shootings, and to six Maryland murders, and received eight more life sentences.\n\nThen the Supreme Court began a string of rulings which recognized the developing nature of teenage brains, and changed the way juveniles are prosecuted. First in 2005, the court ruled that it was unconstitutional for juveniles to receive the death penalty, and in 2010 that juveniles may not receive life sentences for non-homicide convictions. Then in 2012, in \u201cMiller v. Alabama,\u201d the court ruled that juveniles may not be sentenced to life without parole unless they are found to be irreparably criminal. And in 2016, in \u201cMontgomery v. Louisiana,\u201d the court ruled that its \u201cMiller\u201d ruling could be applied to juvenile life sentences imposed years earlier.\n\n\u201cThe distinctive attributes of youth,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan wrote in \u201cMiller,\u201d \u201cdiminish the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders, even when they commit terrible crimes.\u201d The ruling did not prohibit life sentences without parole, but required that judges or juries consider whether the crime \u201creflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity,\u201d or the defendant is \u201cthe rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption\u201d deserving of the harshest penalty.\n\nAnd so Malvo, through his original trial attorney Craig S. Cooley, sought a new sentencing in Virginia. Malvo at the time was one of about 2,800 people nationwide who were juveniles when they were sentenced to life without parole, according to the Campaign for Fair Sentencing of Youth. Once the Supreme Court declared that the \u201cMiller\u201d ruling was retroactive, resentencing hearings began across America, with about 1,950 inmates getting new hearings or relief from new laws: 22 states and the District of Columbia have now prohibited life sentences without parole for juveniles.\n\n\n\nLaw enforcement officers search the Chevrolet Caprice that John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo used during their sniper shootings in the D.C. area in October 2002. Muhammad and Malvo were found sleeping in the car at a rest stop near Frederick, Md., and arrested. The Bushmaster rifle used in the shootings was also found in the car. (BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS)\n\nThere is also a racial disparity to juvenile sentencings, said Jody Kent Lavy, executive director of the Campaign for Fair Sentencing of Youth. \u201cAfrican-American youth get life sentences at a rate of ten times white youth,\u201d Lavy said. \u201cAnd racial disparity actually increases when judges get more discretion in sentencing.\u201d\n\nMalvo, now 34, is one of 12 juveniles serving life in Virginia, and \u201che understands that even if his sentence is reduced...he\u2019s not getting out,\u201d Cooley said. Malvo has six convictions in Maryland, where a similar motion for resentencing is pending, and prosecutors in Arizona, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Washington state could still charge him with murder. \u201cIt may benefit people who have only one charge and sentence to deal with,\" Cooley said of the Supreme Court case. \"It\u2019s an important case for precedential purposes.\u201d\n\nCooley and Malvo first had their resentencing motion granted by U.S. District Judge Raymond A. Jackson in 2017, who made it clear that Malvo\u2019s two convictions in Fairfax County, Va. -- capital murder of FBI analyst Linda Franklin as an act of terrorism, and multiple murders in a three-year period -- and two in Spotsylvania County, Va., were undisturbed and that new sentences could still result in life without parole. In Virginia, juries determine sentences in criminal cases, and judges then impose those sentences, with the option only to reduce them.\n\nMalvo\u2019s trial in 2003 was essentially one long sentencing hearing, in which his defense team laid out his troubled life story, and manipulation by Muhammad, as part of an insanity defense, which the jury rejected. But neither the jury nor Fairfax Circuit Court Judge Jane Marum Roush considered the criteria established nine years later by the Supreme Court, of \u201cirreparable corruption\u201d and the \u201ctransient immaturity of youth,\u201d and Jackson ruled that Malvo was entitled to have his crimes reviewed through that lens.\n\nFranklin\u2019s husband, William \u201cTed\u201d Franklin, said he was unfamiliar with developments in the case and declined to comment.\n\nVirginia Attorney General Mark Herring (D) appealed Jackson\u2019s ruling, and last year the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit reluctantly sided with Malvo. Judges Paul V. Niemeyer, Robert B. King and Albert Diaz wrote that their conclusions were made \u201cnot with any satisfaction but to sustain the law.\u201d\n\nHerring appealed again, and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.\n\nThe attorney general argues that the lower courts improperly expanded the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings to cases where the court had discretion in sentencing, as opposed to a mandatory life sentence.\n\n\n\nIn 2003, Fairfax County Chief Deputy Commonwealth's Attorney Raymond F. Morrogh, left, and Commonwealth's Attorney Robert F. Horan enter the courthouse before the trial of Lee Boyd Malvo. Morrogh, now the Commonwealth's Attorney, opposes Malvo's bid for resentencing. (Rich Lipski/twp)\n\nVirginia has argued twice (and lost twice) that the judge in Malvo\u2019s case had the discretion to reduce the jury\u2019s life term for capital murder to something less. In 2017, the Virginia Supreme Court ruled that life sentences in capital murder cases could be partially suspended. Cooley said that in 2003 \u201ceverybody in the state who did these things believed there was no prerogative for the judge. Certainly the judge didn\u2019t think so.\u201d Cooley, who has tried dozens of capital murder cases and taught capital murder at the University of Richmond Law School, said, \u201cNever did anybody suggest there anything other than the two options: death or life without parole.\u201d\n\nRoush, who imposed the jury\u2019s two life sentences in March 2004, is now retired. She declined to comment. Malvo\u2019s Supreme Court brief notes that Virginia \u201chas identified no case prior to \u2018Miller,\u2019 and counsel is aware of none, in which a Virginia court sentenced a juvenile convicted of capital murder to anything less than life without parole.\u201d For the Supreme Court case, Cooley recruited Washington lawyer Danielle Spinelli to lead Malvo\u2019s team. Spinelli was part of the team which convinced the high court in 2005 to ban executions for juveniles.\n\n\n\nLee Boyd Malvo, now 34, in a recent photo from the Virginia Department of Corrections. He is serving life without parole at the Red Onion State Prison in Pound, Va. (AP/AP)\n\n\u201cA life-without-parole sentence\u201d for a juvenile without considering a defendant\u2019s maturity and changeability, Spinelli wrote, \u201cviolates \u2018Miller\u2019 whether it is \u2018mandatory\u2019 or not.\u201d\n\nBut the 4th Circuit ruled that it didn\u2019t have to decide whether Malvo\u2019s sentences were mandatory because the \u201cMontgomery\u201d case confirmed that \u201ca sentencing judge also violates \u2018Miller\u2019s\u2019 rule any time it imposes a discretionary life-without-parole sentence\u201d without first making a finding of permanent incorrigibility.\n\nFairfax County Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Raymond F. Morrogh, who helped prosecute Malvo in 2003, said Virginia law has never prohibited judges from suspending part of a capital murder sentence, as it specifically does for other crimes.\n\nMorrogh noted that Malvo\u2019s maturity and culpability were amply explored at his trial. \u201cThat was the crux of the defense argument for a month in front of the jury,\u201d Morrogh said. \u201cIt is a rare case that any juvenile should get a life sentence, but these were multiple killings. In my opinion, he was at least as bad as Muhammad. He sat there during the trial and drew pictures of [former Fairfax prosecutor] Bob [Horan] and me with targets on our backs.\u201d\n\nThe case has attracted amicus briefs from significant parties on both sides. The Justice Department filed a brief in support of Virginia, and the court has granted the solicitor general time to participate in Wednesday\u2019s oral arguments.\n\nStone said the impact on the victims should not be overlooked. \u201cThis affects lots of lives across the country,\u201d Stone said. He has represented victims whose juvenile offenders won resentencings in Maryland, and \u201csome ask for our help, some can\u2019t talk when they stand up in court, and some don\u2019t want to deal with it. Their whole life was changed.\u201d\n\nThe American Bar Association and a group of former and current state and federal prosecutors and judges, to include former FBI and CIA Director William Webster, filed briefs on behalf of Malvo, as did a group of crime victims including sniper victims Nichols, shooting survivor Paul LaRuffa and Cheryll Shaw, whose father Jerry Taylor was killed in Arizona in March 2002, as Malvo and Muhammad made their way east from Tacoma.\n\n\n\nCraig S.

(Jahi Chikwendiu/TWP)\n\nLaRuffa\u2019s life was changed in September 2002, when he walked out of his Clinton, Md., restaurant, climbed in his car, and then was shot five times by Malvo at point blank range. Malvo then took $3,000 cash and LaRuffa\u2019s laptop, which Muhammad used to plot their subsequent violence. LaRuffa recovered, is now retired, and supports Malvo\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cI really agree there is a big difference between youth and adult offenders,\u201d LaRuffa said, \u201cand I think they should be treated differently in the justice system. They have a better chance of being rehabilitated.\u201d He said it was \u201chard when you use Malvo as an example,\u201d because the sniper shootings were so horrific. \u201cThis case is for all juveniles. I think it\u2019s reasonable to say if the death penalty for young people is off the table, it\u2019s kind of the same reason life without parole is off the table.\u201d", "description": "The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that juveniles may not be sentenced to mandatory life sentences without parole, and so Malvo is seeking new hearings on his four Va. life sentences.", "authors": ["Tom Jackman", "Reporter Covering Criminal Justice Locally", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EZuPPsCvhF3mEkh0G1_vv8iQGZs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NI3BOZQCWUI6FAIC5PXJYZXBSA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
