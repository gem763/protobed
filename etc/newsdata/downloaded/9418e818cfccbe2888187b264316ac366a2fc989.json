One of the videos showed a person being shot in the head, according to prosecutors.\n\nAMERICAN AIRLINES MECHANIC ACCUSED OF SABOTAGING PLANE DENIED BAIL OVER POSSIBLE TERRORIST TIES\n\nFederal investigators said they also learned that Alani lied about taking a trip to Iraq in March to visit his brother and also sent $700 to someone in Iraq. Alani allegedly told an American Airlines co-worker in June his brother was kidnapped and became a member of the terrorist organization.\n\nAlani, 60, worked as a mechanic for the airline when he allegedly sabotaged a Nassau-bound Boeing 737 with 150 passengers and crew aboard at Miami International Airport over stalled labor negotiations.\n\nProsecutors said Alani glued styrofoam inside the nose of the aircraft that disabled a part used to gauge airspeed and other critical flight data. Pilots detected the issue before takeoff, and a subsequent inspection discovered the problem.\n\nAirport surveillance captured Alani, who walks with a limp, working on the plane's nose for about seven minutes. He was identified by co-workers.\n\nAfter his arrest earlier this month, he told agents he acted \u201cout of my evil side\u201d and \u201cwanted to do something to delay\u201d the plane \u201cto get overtime\u201d for maintenance repairs, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maria Medetis told the judge Wednesday.\n\nAMERICAN AIRLINES MECHANIC ACCUSED OF SABOTAGE WAS FIRED BY ALASKA AIRLINES OVER MISTAKES: REPORT\n\nWhile Alani is not yet charged with a terror-related crime, Medetis said the potential links to the Islamic State give rise to the possibility that his actions had a darker purpose beyond what he insisted was a labor issue.\n\nThe judge ultimately denied Alani bail.\n\nThe defense has argued that prosecutors can\u2019t prove Alani intentionally put people in danger. They said Alani was an experienced mechanic who knew the alleged sabotage would ground the plane before takeoff.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, Alani had been fired from Alaska Airlines in 2008 over several maintenance mistakes, some that led to Federal Aviation Administration investigations, according to court documents from his unsuccessful discrimination lawsuit that Business Insider obtained.\n\nAlani was fired after the incident and the Federal Aviation Administration revoked his aircraft mechanic certificate.\n\nHe is expected to enter a plea Friday on charges of willfully damaging, destroying or disabling an aircraft.\n\nFox News' Louis Casiano and Brie Stimson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "An American Airlines mechanic accused of sabotaging a plane in July reportedly told arresting agents he had an \u201cevil side,\u201d a nefarious persona\u00a0prosecutors sought to expose Wednesday as they presented alleged\u00a0evidence of his Islamist sympathies -- and aspirations --\u00a0at a bail hearing in Miami.", "authors": ["Stephen Sorace"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/19/694940094001_6087686013001_6087689556001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
