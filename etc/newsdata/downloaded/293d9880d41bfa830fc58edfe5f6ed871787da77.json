Maher, who hosts HBO's \"Real Time,\" discussed obesity on his show last week.\n\n\"We have gone to this weird place where fat is good. It's pointing out that fat is unhealthy, that's what's bad,\" Maher said. \"Fat shaming doesn't need to end. It needs to make a comeback. Some amount of shame is good.\"\n\nCorden said he was surprised at Maher's rant because Maher had been \"pleasant\" with him in the past. He also noted that \"fat-shaming never went anywhere.\"\n\n\"There's a common and insulting misconception that fat people are stupid and lazy and we're not,\" Corden said. \"We get it. We know that being overweight isn't good for us and I've struggled my entire life with trying to manage my weight and I suck at it.\"\n\n\"We're not all as lucky as Bill Maher. We don't all have a sense of superiority that burns 35,000 calories a day... Fat-shaming is just bullying and bullying only makes the problem worse,\" Corden added.\n\nHe ended his segment with a word of advice for Maher: \"While you're encouraging people to think about what goes into their mouths, just think a little harder about what comes out of yours.\"", "description": "\"We're not all as lucky as Bill Maher.
