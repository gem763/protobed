As a result, it said, manufacturers would cut spending on research and development, which would lead to fewer new drugs being introduced over time. CBO projected that a reduction in revenues of $500 billion to $1 trillion would lead to about 8 to 15 fewer drugs coming to market over 10 years, out of approximately 300 drugs in total that might be approved over that time.\n\n\u201cCBO\u2019s report confirms House Democrats\u2019 \u2018dictate or destroy\u2019 price controls only serve to hurt the development of future cures and damage American innovation,\u201d Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s tracking poll finds that 88% of Americans favor allowing the federal government to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies for Medicare, though that support shrinks to 33% or less when people are told that the policy could lead to less drug research and development or limit access to newer medications.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor its analysis, CBO assumed Pelosi\u2019s legislation would be enacted by the end of this year, and House Democrats reportedly hope to bring it to a vote as soon as the end of the month as part of an effort to signal that they remain focused on American\u2019s pocketbook issues even as they pursue an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. But GOP lawmakers oppose Pelosi\u2019s bill and the idea of allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices \u2014 and progressives are reportedly working on a list of changes they\u2019d like to make to the plan.\n\n\u201cCongressional Republicans have said they want to work with Democrats on much smaller drug pricing legislation, for example speeding the introduction of cheaper generic drugs,\u201d The Hill\u2019s Peter Sullivan writes. \u201cPelosi is still hoping that if Trump, who has railed against high drug prices, endorses the bill, it would put pressure on congressional Republicans. Still, the measure faces dim hopes in the Senate, where Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has vowed to block it.\u201d\n\nLike what you're reading?
