He\u2019s got the big serve, he\u2019s got the height and he uses angles very well,\u201d said Djokovic.\n\n\u201cBackhand \u2014 hard to break that backhand, it\u2019s very flat.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t make many mistakes and he can hit anything he wants from that corner.\n\n\u201cForehand maybe has been his weaker side, but now he\u2019s improved that, so he\u2019s a very complete player.\u201d\n\nMedvedev, seeded three, starts his Shanghai Masters later Tuesday against Britain\u2019s Cameron Norrie.\n\nNadal, ranked second in the world, pulled out of Shanghai because of a wrist problem.\n\nBut Djokovic is primed for a battle with the 19-time Grand Slam champion for the year-end number one spot.\n\n\u201cI have been in this position many times before, obviously,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRafa has had an amazing year so far and I have to do well here in order to really have a chance or go toe to toe with him in the indoor season.\u201d", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 World number one Novak Djokovic hailed Daniil Medvedev as a \u201cvery complete player\u201d on Tuesday, having lost to the young", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/b69d47_novak-djokovic-serbia-hits-return-his-men-doubles-kevin-krawietz-andreas-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
