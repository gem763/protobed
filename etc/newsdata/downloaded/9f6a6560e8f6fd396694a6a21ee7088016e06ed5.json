U.S officials say, however, that those troops were expected to be repositioned in the region. Some of them could go to Iraq.\n\n\u201cI viewed the situation on the Turkish border with Syria to be for the United States strategically brilliant,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cSyria may have some help with Russia, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a lot of sand,\u201d he later said. \u201cSo you have Syria and you have Turkey. They\u2019re going to argue it out, maybe they\u2019re going to fight it out. But our men aren\u2019t going to get killed over it.\u201d\n\nActing last week after a phone call on Oct. 6 with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Trump abruptly upended five years of U.S. policy with his decision to withhold protection from Syria\u2019s Kurds and to withdraw first about 50 special operations forces and then the roughly 1,000 U.S. troops in northern Syria.\n\n\u201cThis is a mistake worse than what (Barack) Obama did\u201d when the former president withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, Republican U.S. Senator Lindsay Graham, usually among Trump\u2019s strongest supporters, told reporters.\n\nThe White House, fighting the domestic political damage, released a letter dated Oct. 9 by Trump to Erdogan that said: \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool!\u201d, urging him to halt the offensive.\n\nSANCTIONS\n\nWashington announced sanctions on Monday to punish Turkey, but Trump\u2019s critics said the steps, mainly a steel tariffs hike and a pause in trade talks, were too feeble to have an impact.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said sanctions included the entire ministries of energy and defense and could be broadened to others. Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives plan to introduce sanctions legislation.\n\nTrump dispatched some of his top aides, including Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Turkey for emergency talks to try to persuade Ankara to halt its assault. Trump said he thought Pence and Erdogan would have a \u201csuccessful meeting\u201d with Erdogan, adding that if they did not, U.S. sanctions and tariffs \u201cwill be devastating to Turkey\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nErdogan\u2019s spokesman said Turkey\u2019s Foreign Ministry was preparing retaliation for U.S. sanctions.\n\nA meeting between Trump and Republican and Democratic lawmakers was cut short - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top congressional Democrat, said Trump had a \u201cmeltdown\u201d over a 354-60 House vote condemning his Syria withdrawal. Republicans said Pelosi \u201cstormed out.\u201d\n\nSmoke rises over the Syrian town of Ras al Ain, as seen from the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nDozens of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans joined the majority Democrats in the vote. The split underscored deep unhappiness in Congress over Trump\u2019s action, which many lawmakers view as abandoning Kurdish fighters who had been loyally fighting alongside Americans to defeat Islamic State.\n\nTrump has denied giving a green light to Turkey to attack the Syrian Kurds.\n\nErdogan has insisted there will be no ceasefire, and said he might call off a visit to the United States in November because of the \u201cvery big disrespect\u201d shown by U.S. politicians.\n\nHe also denounced Washington for taking the \u201cunlawful, ugly step\u201d of imposing criminal charges against a Turkish state bank over charges it broke sanctions on Iran. Washington says the case is unrelated to politics.\n\nTurkey\u2019s assault has spawned a humanitarian crisis, with 160,000 civilians taking flight, a security alert over thousands of Islamic State fighters abandoned in Kurdish jails, and a political maelstrom at home for Trump.\n\nSyrian government forces, backed by Washington\u2019s adversaries Russia and Iran in the more than eight-year civil war, have taken advantage of the power vacuum left by U.S. troops to advance into the largest swath of territory previously outside their grasp.\n\nSenior Republicans voiced dismay.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that we are where we are,\u201d the characteristically understated Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, telling reporters he hoped Pence and Pompeo \u201ccan somehow repair the damage\u201d during their trip to Ankara.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. prosecutors unveiled charges against Turkey\u2019s majority state-owned Halkbank over allegations it took part in a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran. Halkbank denies wrongdoing and called the case part of the sanctions against Turkey.\n\nThe Turkish advance, and Washington\u2019s decision to evacuate its own forces, have brought the two biggest militaries in NATO close to confrontation on the battlefield. The United States has complained about Turkish artillery fire near its troops.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nThe Syrian Observatory said Russian troops had crossed the Euphrates River to advance to Kobani\u2019s outskirts.\n\nLebanon\u2019s al-Mayadeen TV reported that Russian-backed Syrian forces had also set up outposts in Raqqa, the one-time capital of Islamic State\u2019s caliphate, which the Kurds captured in 2017 at the peak of their campaign with U.S. support.\n\nTrump did not object to an agreement cut between Kurdish-led forces and the Syrian government to protect Syria from a Turkish offensive, Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) Commander Mazloum Kobani said.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had no problem if Russia helped Syria in a conflict with NATO ally Turkey and rejected criticism of his withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria that exposed Kurdish allies, calling it \"strategically brilliant.\"", "authors": ["Alexandra Alper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441586874&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1SV", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
