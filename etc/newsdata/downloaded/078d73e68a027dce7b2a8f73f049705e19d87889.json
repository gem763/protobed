Although it has attractive new styling and a new hybrid powertrain, it retains the same practical and highly spacious interior that's made it such a favorite. Unfortunately, we strongly suspect that this new Fit won't be sold in the U.S. market, as U.S. Honda representatives won't comment on its future, leading us to believe that this nameplate will be dropped from the lineup soon.\n\nThere are five versions of the new Fit: Basic, Home, Ness, and Luxe models essentially serve as different trim levels with various trim and color options, while a Crosstar variant incorporates SUV-esque design cues to turn the Fit into a little crossover imitator.\n\nThe same innovative layout that places the fuel tank under the front seats makes for a remarkably spacious cabin, with rear seats bottom cushions that can be folded up to accommodate taller items in addition to the traditional fold-flat seats that expand the cargo area.\n\nPhoto credit: Honda More\n\nHonda isn't providing much detail about the Fit's powertrains at this point, only saying that it will offer some sort of standard gasoline engine as standard and a new two-motor hybrid system as an option.\n\nThe current third-generation Fit remains on sale in the U.S. for now, but we believe its days are numbered, as Fit sales have dwindled and are down 17 percent through September of 2019. The little hatchback is outsold by its crossover counterpart the HR-V by a factor of more than two to one, and Honda recently shifted Fit production back to Japan so that it could build more HR-Vs in Mexico where the two nameplates previously shared a production line.\n\nWe've reached out to Honda representatives for an official word on the Fit's fate in the U.S. and will update this story with more information. The new model will go on sale in other global markets in February 2020.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The new fourth-generation Fit hatchback is here, but its prospects for the U.S. are not looking good.", "authors": ["Connor Hoffman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/09sjfW3daBtO2jjK2bXsNg--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/bb4c54c3850b0f0ded0b15cd9db85799", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
