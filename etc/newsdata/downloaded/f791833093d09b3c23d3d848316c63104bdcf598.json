REUTERS/Lisi Niesner\n\nIt also said Iran was starting to follow through on its pledge last week to further breach its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, this time installing more advanced centrifuges and moving towards enriching uranium with them, which the deal bans.\n\nDiplomats say Iran has yet to explain to the International Atomic Energy Agency how the uranium particles ended up at what Tehran has said was a carpet-cleaning facility.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vehemently opposes Iran\u2019s nuclear deal with major powers, first pointed to the site last year, calling it a \u201csecret atomic warehouse\u201d and saying it had housed unspecified radioactive material that had since been removed.\n\nDetails of IAEA inspections are confidential and the agency generally does not comment on them. But the IAEA\u2019s acting chief made clear that in meetings in Tehran on Sunday he pushed Iran to improve cooperation with the U.N. non-proliferation watchdog.\n\n\u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d Cornel Feruta, who took over as IAEA chief in an acting capacity after the death of his boss Yukiya Amano in July, told a news conference during a quarterly IAEA Board of Governors meeting.\n\n\u201cI think that was a message very well understood,\u201d he said of his meetings with officials including Iran\u2019s foreign minister and its nuclear energy chief.\n\nThe IAEA has told member states that Iran has had two months to answer its questions, though it has only given a very general description of the issue because it is confidential, diplomats who attended a briefing by its inspections chief last week said.\n\nAt the same time, the Vienna-based IAEA has not yet sounded the alarm because such questions are part of a painstaking process that can often take many months.\n\n\u201cWe are very, let\u2019s say rigorous, meticulous and we are faithful to our mandate,\u201d Feruta said, without going into specifics.\n\nNEW BREACH\n\nThe 2015 nuclear deal only lets Iran enrich uranium with just over 5,000 of its first-generation IR-1 centrifuge machines. It can use far fewer more advanced centrifuges for research but without accumulating enriched uranium.\n\nBut in response to U.S. sanctions imposed since Washington withdrew from the deal in May last year, Iran has been breaching the limits it imposed on its atomic activities step by step.\n\nLast week the Islamic Republic said it would exceed the deal\u2019s limits on research and development, the term applied to Iran\u2019s use of technologically advanced centrifuges.\n\nAn IAEA spokesman said Iran had informed it that it was making modifications to accommodate cascades - or interconnected clusters - of 164 of the IR-2m and IR-4 centrifuge. Cascades of the same size and type were scrapped under the deal.\n\nIAEA inspectors have verified that smaller numbers of various advanced centrifuges had been or were being installed, the spokesman added.\n\n\u201cAll of the installed centrifuges had been prepared for testing with UF6,\u201d though none of them were being tested with UF6 on Sept. 7 and 8, he said, referring to the uranium hexafluoride feedstock for centrifuges.\n\nHe added that Iran had also informed the agency it would modify lines of research centrifuges so that enriched uranium was produced, which is not allowed under the deal.\n\nIn a confidential report to member states, the IAEA also said Iran had made those modifications on some lines.", "description": "The U.N. nuclear watchdog told Iran on Monday there is no time to waste in answering its questions, which diplomats say include how traces of uranium were found at a site that was not declared to the agency.", "authors": ["Francois Murphy", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427891486&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880SS", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
