Just ask your smartphone.\n\nStarting Wednesday, McDonald\u2019s Corp. MCD, +0.08% will let job seekers start an application by using voice commands with Amazon\u2019s AMZN, +0.27% Alexa or Google\u2019s GOOGL, -0.14% Assistant.\n\nIf users say, \u201cAlexa, help me get a job at McDonald\u2019s,\u201d Alexa will ask which country they want to work in and play McDonald\u2019s catchy \u201cI\u2019m lovin\u2019 it\u201d jingle. After that, users can share their phone number and get a link to continue the application process. Alexa also shares some facts about working for the company, such as how it can lead to jobs in other fields.\n\nThe function is available in the U.S., Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. McDonald\u2019s is also exploring adding the feature in other markets. It\u2019s not yet available through Apple\u2019s Siri.\n\nThe move is an unusual one. While some job recruitment companies have built voice-recognition systems on Google and Amazon\u2019s platforms, but both companies say McDonald\u2019s is the first direct employer to use its platform in this way. McDonald\u2019s developed the technology itself.\n\nFor McDonald\u2019s, voice-initiated hiring is a way to stand out in a tight job market. The U.S. unemployment rate of 3.7% is near a 50-year low. Unemployment is also below 4% in the U.K. and Germany.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s employs 2 million people at 38,000 restaurants worldwide, and its needs are constantly changing based on turnover and seasonal demands. Over the summer, the Chicago-based company said it was hiring 250,000 people in the U.S. alone. McDonald\u2019s is currently seeking 338 part-time crew workers in the New York area and 414 in Toronto, according to company hiring sites.\n\nApplications by voice \u2014 dubbed McDonald\u2019s Apply Thru \u2014 are also part of a broader effort to use technology to streamline every part of the restaurant, said David Fairhurst, McDonald\u2019s executive vice president and chief people officer. For customers, that means digital ordering kiosks and mobile ordering; for employees, it means online scheduling and virtual reality games to train store managers.", "description": "Starting Wednesday, McDonald\u2019s Corp. will let job seekers start an application by using voice commands with Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Google\u2019s Assistant.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR999_mcd_hi_ZG_20190925061405.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
