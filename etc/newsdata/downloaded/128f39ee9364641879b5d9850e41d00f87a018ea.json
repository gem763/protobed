On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nA high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Bukit Sembawang Estates. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying Bukit Sembawang Estates for its dividend - read on to learn more.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Bukit Sembawang Estates!\n\nSGX:B61 Historical Dividend Yield, October 26th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 10% of Bukit Sembawang Estates's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. We like this low payout ratio, because it implies the dividend is well covered and leaves ample opportunity for reinvestment.\n\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Unfortunately, while Bukit Sembawang Estates pays a dividend, it also reported negative free cash flow last year. While there may be a good reason for this, it's not ideal from a dividend perspective.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Bukit Sembawang Estates's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Bukit Sembawang Estates has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having fallen by at least 20% one or more times over this time. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was S$0.11 in 2009, compared to S$0.22 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 7.2% per year over this time. The growth in dividends has not been linear, but the CAGR is a decent approximation of the rate of change over this time frame.\n\nDividends have grown at a reasonable rate, but with at least one substantial cut in the payments, we're not certain this dividend stock would be ideal for someone intending to live on the income.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. Over the past five years, it looks as though Bukit Sembawang Estates's EPS have declined at around 2.1% a year. If earnings continue to decline, the dividend may come under pressure. Every investor should make an assessment of whether the company is taking steps to stabilise the situation.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like Bukit Sembawang Estates Limited (SGX:B61) tend to be popular with investors, and for good...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Jl.N1iyKd03I06jU0eqXzA--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/aeeab1cb94c518d386a509c2490cb429", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
