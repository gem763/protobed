He also said the ECB is \u201csymmetric\u201d in its pursuit of its price -stability target.\n\nAs he nears the end of his tenure at the ECB, Draghi repeated his view that more government spending \u201ccould greatly help\u201d the central bank\u2019s mission. He warned that the current loose stimulus \u201cmay have to last a long time if there is no support from fiscal policy\u201d and will be less effective unless governments loosen their purse strings.\n\nHis comments will probably irk countries such as Germany which have traditionally rejected talk of loosening government budgets. The ECB\u2019s most recent policy meeting sparked a revolt from officials upset over Draghi\u2019s plan to reactivate quantitative easing, with central bank governors from countries including Germany, France and the Netherlands opposing the measure.\n\nGerman Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger unexpectedly quit last week, more than two years before the end of her term. She spoke against the need for renewed bond-buying before the meeting.\n\nDraghi indirectly blamed the Bundesbank for his rather testy relationship with the German public. His whatever-it-takes pledge to save the euro was challenged in courts by a group of German lawyers. Newspaper Bild portrayed him as a vampire sucking out savings the day after the ECB\u2019s most recent stimulus decisions.\n\n\u201cExplanation of our policies to the citizens of the euro zone relies on national central bank communication,\u201d ECB president, who leaves at the end of October, told the FT. \u201cWhenever they supported Governing Council decisions at national level, public opinion at country level was also supportive.\u201d\n\nDraghi also pointed to a number of dangers faced by the 19-nation region, including the risk of a no-deal Brexit, which has gone up.\n\nHe urged a closer fiscal union for the euro area, saying without it the currency zone will remain a \u201cfragile construction.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the inherent weakness of national states in a globalized world, what matters is to make the union stronger. In some areas, further integration achieves this goal,\u201d Draghi said. \u201cWe need a common euro-zone budget. Clearly the political debate on that still has a long way to go. But I am optimistic.\u201d", "description": "Draghi Says ECB Has Room to Do More, But Needs Fiscal Backup", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pica134a7f83086e96a9cb1e3ffb13101c4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
