(AP Photo/Baderkhan Ahmad)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is leaning in favor of a new Pentagon plan to keep a small contingent of U.S. troops in eastern Syria, perhaps numbering about 200, to combat the Islamic State group and block the advance of Syrian government and Russian forces into the region\u2019s coveted oil fields, a senior administration official said Sunday.\n\nIf Trump approves the proposal to leave a couple of hundred Special Operations forces in eastern Syria, it would mark the second time in 10 months that he has reversed his order to pull out nearly all U.S. troops from the country. Last December, Trump directed 2,000 U.S. troops to leave Syria immediately, only to relent later and approve a more gradual withdrawal.\n\nThe decision would also be the potential second major political reversal in a matter of days under pressure from his own party, after he rescinded Saturday a decision to host next year\u2019s Group of 7 summit at his own resort.\n\nTrump has come under withering criticism from former military commanders, Democrats and even some of his staunchest Republican allies for pulling back U.S. troops from Syria\u2019s border with Turkey, clearing the way for a Turkish offensive that in nearly two weeks has killed scores of Syrian Kurdish fighters and civilians and displaced hundreds of thousands of residents.\n\nA senior administration official said Sunday that Trump has since last week been considering a plan to leave a couple of hundred troops in northeast Syria, near the border with Iraq, for counterterrorism efforts. The official said it is a concept Trump favors.\n\nThree other administration and Defense Department officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential military planning, confirmed over the weekend that the option was being discussed among top U.S. policymakers and commanders.\n\nThe senior administration official said it was highly likely that troops would be kept along the Iraqi border area \u2014 away from the cease-fire zone that Vice President Mike Pence negotiated with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey last week. The main goal would be to prevent the Islamic State group from reestablishing all or parts of its religious state, or caliphate, in Syria and neighboring Iraq.\n\nA side benefit would be helping the Kurds keep control of oil fields in the east, the official said.\n\nTrump seemed to hint at this outcome in a message on Twitter on Sunday, saying, \u201cWe have secured the Oil.\u201d\n\nThe senior administration official suggested that the president was balancing competing impulses: achieving the ultimate goal of bringing U.S. forces home from Syria \u2014 part of a signature campaign promise to pull U.S. troops from \u201cendless wars\u201d \u2014 and ensuring that efforts to contain and diminish ISIS continue. The order also could be heard as at least a partial answer to those who have criticized the president\u2019s policy.\n\nThe officials indicated that Trump could describe the continued deployment of the small contingent of troops as a thoughtful, reasonable way to help safeguard regional and U.S. security without violating his campaign pledge.\n\nThe senior official insisted the president\u2019s approach to the incursion ordered by Erdogan had been mischaracterized and pushed back against a widely held public narrative that Trump \u201cgreenlighted\u201d the attack. Critics of Trump\u2019s Syria policy have said the president, by telling Erdogan that he would order U.S. troops to pull back from positions along the border where they had fought alongside Syrian Kurds, essentially acquiesced to the Turkish offensive.\n\nErdogan called Trump on Oct. 6 for the express purpose of informing him that Turkish forces planned to cross the border, the official said, and Trump made it clear to him that it was not a good idea \u2014 and did not endorse the attack. Trump followed up on Oct. 9 with a now-infamous letter to Erdogan.\n\nThe senior administration official said the U.S. troops were withdrawn from the border area because Turkish forces were coming across into Syria, and that they were sitting in harm\u2019s way, a rationale that Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also have expressed in recent days.\n\nSpokeswomen for Esper and Milley declined on Sunday to comment on any options under discussion.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is leaning in favor of a new Pentagon plan to keep a small contingent of U.S. troops in eastern Syria, perhaps numbering about 200, to combat the Islamic State group and block the advance of Syrian government and Russian forces into the region's coveted oil fields", "authors": ["Eric Schmitt", "Maggie Haberman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LuQnj9cmHyTv2WyjJgM7zA--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/95a402a0-f3fd-11e9-a975-d65a810ab54f", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
