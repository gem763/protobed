An image of a letter confirming the star's music would not be used by Trump and his team in October 2018 was also posted online\n\nTrump raged against Joe and Hunter Biden at his first campaign rally since the impeachment inquiry began, calling the former vice president an 'a** kisser'\n\nPrince's legal team relentlessly protected his material from unauthorized use prior to his passing in 2016, and a copyright case involving a YouTube video of a baby dancing to his song 'Let's Go Crazy' notably became the subject of a lengthy federal appeals case that nearly made its way to the Supreme Court.\n\nPrince died in 2016 from an accidental fentanyl overdose at his Paisley Park complex in Chanhassen, Minnesota.\n\nAttorneys for Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler sent a cease-and-desist letter to the White House in August ordering the president to stop playing the song 'Livin' on the Edge' at rallies, roughly three years after taking similar action in response to Mr. Trump using the tune 'Dream On' on the campaign tail without approval.\n\nQueen complained after Mr. Trump took the stage to 'We Are the Champions' during the 2016 Republican National Convention, roughly two months after lawyers for the Stones declared the band's entire catalog off-limits to Mr. Trump in light of his campaign using 'Start Me Up' without permission.\n\nNeil Young was the first artist to raise objecting with Mr. Trump using their music, and within hours of the president declaring his candidacy.\n\nRepresentatives for Mr. Young issued a statement shortly after 'Rockin' in the Free World' was played without permission during Mr. Trump's candidacy announcement in June 2015.", "description": "The star's, inset, team issued a statement on Twitter after the song was heard on loudspeakers\u00a0at The Target Center before POTUS took the stage, main, on Thursday.", "authors": ["Lauren Fruen For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/05/19570826-0-image-a-19_1570766594006.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
