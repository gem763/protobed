Lucy McBath\u2019s (D-GA) office in Sandy Springs, Georgia, over her support of pursuing an impeachment inquiry against President Trump.\n\nMcBath, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee, voted in favor of the impeachment inquiry last month. Protesters gathered outside of her office on Wednesday to demonstrate support for the president, chanting \u201cfour more years\u201d and holding up Trump 2020 signs. One sign spotted at the protest read, \u201cImpeach Pelosi.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s had an agenda from day one to bring [Trump] down,\u201d resident Jill Wright said of McBath, according to AJC.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats need to work for their constituents and not have an agenda,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey are disrespecting our president and they are also setting a poor example for our children.\u201d\n\nMcBath is in a vulnerable district, barely edging out former Rep. Karen Handel (R-GA) in 2018. McBath won by one percent, or 3,264 votes.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District tilted in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor in the 2016 election by 1.5 percent, although Trump ultimately won the state. However, as internal polling suggests, Democrats in key congressional districts face an uphill battle, as the majority of constituents do not consider Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky an impeachable offense, and that conversation largely serves as the basis for the partisan-fueled impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cPro-Trump patriots showed up to @RepLucyMcBath\u2018s office in #GA06 this week to protest her support of Pelosi\u2019s impeachment witch-hunt,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. wrote.\n\n\u201cSorry #LiberalLucy, you can\u2019t vote for Pelosi for Speaker, support her impeachment witch-hunt and still call yourself a \u2018moderate,'\u201d he added. \u201c#VoteHerOut\u201d:\n\nPro-Trump patriots showed up to @RepLucyMcBath's office in #GA06 this week to protest her support of Pelosi's impeachment witch-hunt.

Protesters confronted Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at the Reno airport this month and demanded her to \u201cstop the impeachment\u201d of Trump:\n\nNevadans greeted @ewarren in Reno and let them know exactly how they feel about the Democrats\u2019 despicable attempt to impeach @realDonaldTrump and undo the 2016 election.
