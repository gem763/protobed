Who gains from that? Not my people.\n\n\"I just couldn't be a sellout. I couldn't be an enabler. There's things within that organization that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.\"\n\nMaroon 5 was the halftime performer, with Big Boi and Travis Scott also taking part.\n\nRihanna wasn't the only celebrity to refuse a role at the Super Bowl over Kaepernick. Comedian Amy Schumer posted on Instagram in October 2018 that, as a show of support for the quarterback, she wouldn't appear in a Super Bowl commercial.\n\nKaepernick has not played in the NFL since 2016. His decision to kneel during the national anthem before games helped launch a social justice movement in the league that led to the Inspire Change initiative, through which NFL owners have agreed to contribute up to $89 million over six years toward causes players were supporting.\n\nJennifer Lopez and Shakira will be the co-headliners of the Super Bowl LIV halftime show in Miami this season. They will be the first artists to perform during the NFL's signature event since the league entered into a partnership with Roc Nation, the entertainment company founded by rapper, businessman and activist Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter, to lead its endeavors in music and entertainment.", "description": "In her support of Colin Kaepernick, Rihanna says she \"couldn't be an enabler\" by performing at the Super Bowl last February.", "authors": ["Jake Trotter", "Brooke Pryor", "Adam Teicher", "Eric D.
