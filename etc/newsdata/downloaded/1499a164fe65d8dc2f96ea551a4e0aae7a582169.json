This giraffe will be rehabilitated and return to the wild, as a number of others have done before him. Right now, giraffes are undergoing what has been referred to as a silent extinction. Current estimates are that giraffe populations across Africa have dropped 40 percent in three decades, plummeting from approximately 155,000 in the late 1980s to under 100,000 today. The decline is thought to be caused by to habitat loss and fragmentation and poaching, but because there haven't been long term conservation efforts in the past, it's hard to know exactly what is happening. Reticulated giraffes themselves number fewer than 16,000 individuals. Scientists are now undertaking major studies to better understand why giraffes are disappearing and what can be done to stop it.

Naskmariz/PhotoVoice/Frontline AIDS/PITCH\n\nAccording to Reuters, Shell said earlier this year it plans to take an \u201cactive role\u201d in the auction \u2013 the fourth round of leases auctioned by the Crown Estate.\n\nIn a statement, the Crown Estate said the auction comes after \u201c18 months of engagement with the market and stakeholders through which The Crown Estate has developed and refined its proposals\u201d.\n\nCompanies will assess the areas available and then make their own proposals for project sites.\n\nThe Crown Estate will then asses the viability of the proposals, with the tender process beginning in October and expected to take around 12 months.\n\nFirst seabed rights could be awarded in early 2021, The Crown Estate said.\n\nExisting leases on the Crown Estate charge royalties equal to 2 per cent of revenues for use of its seabeds. In 2018 the business collected \u00a341m from offshore wind. The latest round is expected to generate millions more for the Treasury and the Crown Estate.\n\nHuub den Rooijen, director of energy, minerals and infrastructure at the Crown Estate said: \u201cThe UK is home to the world\u2019s largest offshore wind market, attracting global investment, meeting UK electricity needs, and playing a crucial role in the transition to a net zero economy.\n\n\u201cLeasing Round 4 is the next chapter in this remarkable transition, developed and refined through extensive engagement with the market and stakeholders, to deliver an attractive, fair, objective process, which helps to balance a range of interests in the marine environment.\n\n\u201cRound 4 projects will take the UK sector from strength to strength, delivering clean, affordable, home-grown electricity and joining a robust pipeline of projects in UK waters, which together will deliver a fourfold increase in operational offshore wind capacity by 2030\u201d.\n\nThe estate\u2019s last major licensing round for offshore wind took place a decade ago, with winners including Britain\u2019s SSE and Norway\u2019s Statkraft announced in early 2010.\n\nBritain currently has around 9.3GW of operational offshore wind capacity, with over 8 per cent of the country\u2019s electricity coming from offshore wind in 2018.\n\nThis includes the world\u2019s largest fully operation offshore wind farm, Orsted\u2019s 659 megawatt Walney Extension project off the coast of Cumbria.\n\nCrown Estate Scotland is also set to launch an offshore wind seabed licensing round for sites off the Scottish coast in October.\n\nHugh McNeal, Chief Executive of industry body RenewableUK said: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see the UK stepping up its ambition with a new round of offshore wind development now underway. This will engender further momentum in our world-leading offshore wind sector, securing billions of pounds in investment in new infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThese powerhouses of the future will create thousands of highly-skilled jobs, continuing the rapid regeneration of our coastal communities, as well as benefitting our UK-wide supply chain.\u201d\n\nJonathan Marshall, head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, also welcomed the move.\n\nHe told The Independent: \u201cThe more people we have competing for the contracts that underpin offshore wind, the more competitive it is and the lower prices will be, so the less we\u2019ll be paying for our electricity.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe amount of offshore wind the UK needs to build to meet its carbon targets is quite significant.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the government wants to stay within any sort of distance of its carbon targets it\u2019s going to have to allocate more and more offshore wind.\n\nAndrew Cooper, the Green Party\u2019s energy spokesperson, told The Independent: \u201cOur preference is for publicly or community owned wind farms where energy is generated for the common good rather than private or corporate gain, but we can\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We have a climate emergency and we need to generate energy from clean sources urgently so we welcome any positive action that addresses the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cWe would also ask the royal estate to invest the share they receive from the wind farm into further actions which reduce carbon emissions preferably to benefit people on lower incomes and those in fuel poverty.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "description": "The royal family is expected to raise millions as the Crown Estate announces\u00a0its first major auction of offshore windfarm leases in a decade.
