Bobby Ginn said the wind blew the soldiers into pine trees after they jumped from a C-130 cargo plane, according to a report from WDAM7. But there was no wind whatsoever, witnesses told the Washington Examiner.\n\n\"They were calm skies,\" one paratrooper said. \"The kind of calm where a flag hangs limp.\" The paratrooper, and others who talked to the Washington Examiner, spoke without attribution because they are not authorized to communicate with the media.\n\nThe jump went awry on two levels, soldiers said.\n\n\"Shit just didn't line up between the jump masters in the plane and the jump masters on the ground,\" one airborne soldier told the Washington Examiner.\n\n\"It had to do with getting the right jump rhythm,\" said another.\n\nThe drop zone is very small, about half the size of a football field, the first soldier said. \"It's a tight zone, even in daylight.\"\n\nA US paratrooper during Exercise Swift Response 16 in Germany, June 15, 2016. Visual Information Specialist Gertrud Zach/US Army\n\nAnother soldier who has frequently jumped at Shelby said the mission, part of Arctic Anvil training, \"was a MASS TAC [Mass Tactical] exercise, aiming to get as many soldiers on the ground as possible at one time, in order to overwhelm the enemy.\"\n\n\"They try to mass numbers on the ground in as little time as possible,\" the soldier said. \"Normally there are 1-2 seconds between jumpers. The jump masters pushed out as many as they could during the green light.\"\n\nMore soldiers wanted to take part in the jump but were unable to get on the roster.\n\n\"They flew in a long way to do this,\" the first soldier said. \"They rigged up somewhere else and flew in to get on the jump.\"\n\nOne witness on Reddit identified as \"al_1776\" said 84 members of the unit became stuck in trees after the jump. Witnesses reported multiple medical evacuations were made via helicopter to Forrest General Hospital in nearby Hattiesburg.\n\nThe injured paratroopers belong to the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, based in Alaska. They have been participating in a 10-day training exercise called Arctic Anvil, which included 650 soldiers jumping into the drop zone.\n\n\"Airborne operations all bear an inherent risk,\" the 4th Brigade said in a statement posted to Facebook. \"We strive to mitigate this risk as much as possible. Forrest General Hospital was notified prior to the jump of the potential influx of patients and the types of injuries to be expected and emergency vehicles were on standby on Camp Shelby prior to the jump.\"", "description": "\"They were calm skies,\" one of the paratroopers involved in the botched jump said. \"The kind of calm where a flag hangs limp.\"", "authors": ["Russ Read", "Washington Examiner"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5991dc4df1a85012028b4bc9?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
