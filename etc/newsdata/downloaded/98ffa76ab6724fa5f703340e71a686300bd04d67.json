The Russian ruble rose by over 1% against the dollar, while the Korean won strengthened by 0.9%.\n\nThe news also caused the euro to turn around after it had initially sunk in response to the European Central Bank's latest package of monetary easing measures earlier in the day. The ECB cut its key deposit rate to -0.5% and said it would resume quantitative easing on an open-ended basis against the backdrop of a slowdown that was \"more serious than expected\" in the words of its outgoing President Mario Draghi.\n\nThe , which measures the greenback\u2019s strength against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.2% to 98.390 as of 10:26 AM ET (14:26 GMT). The euro recovered to $1.1045, up 0.3% on the day, up from an intra-day low of $1.0927 after the ECB's decision.\n\nThe ECB's action would have normally raised the pressure on the Federal Reserve to follow suit at its own policy meeting next week. However, given that the reported move by the White House would remove some of the uncertainty that has been weighing on the U.S. economy, it may also weaken the argument for the Fed to loosen policy.\n\nThe Japanese yen, a safe-haven in times of market turmoil, fell with rising 0.1% to 107.92.", "description": "Forex - Euro Surges vs Dollar as Trade Truce Report Trumps ECB", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEAB106U_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
