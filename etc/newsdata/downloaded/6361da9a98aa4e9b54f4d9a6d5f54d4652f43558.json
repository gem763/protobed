We\u2019ll split the analysis into three groups: very cheap, mid-tier, and expensive. A greater emphasis will be placed on the lower end of the price scale.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nThere are 12 games available tonight.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDIRT CHEAP BARGAINS\n\nTim Melville \u2013 SP \u2013 Colorado Rockies (at Giants)\n\nMelville is a below average, soft-tossing righty. He\u2019s among the worst pitchers in the league, although his numbers have been greatly affected by Coors Field. In a super small sample, he\u2019s allowed an 8.04 ERA at home (15.2 innings) and a 2.13 ERA on the road (12.2 innings). We shouldn\u2019t let this split affect our analysis beyond allowing the possibility that sea level Melville might not be entirely futile. To return value on his price tag, he need only supply about five innings and four strikeouts. The Giants offense is weak, and Oracle Park is pitcher friendly.\n\nBrian Dozier \u2013 2B \u2013 Washington Nationals (vs Drew Smyly)\n\nDozier is a classic platoon target. Although he\u2019s performed rather unimpressively overall, he\u2019s still mashed lefties to the tune of .281/.379/.509. As in his peak, he remains an extreme pull hitter. Smyly is excessively homer prone (2.59 HR/9) in part because he allows a lot of pulled, fly ball contact. Dozier projects to deliver around one-quarter of a home run with upside to go wild.\n\nBrad Miller \u2013 2B/3B \u2013 Philadelphia Phillies (vs Anibal Sanchez)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Phillies are using Miller in the heart of the lineup. He\u2019ll likely bat fifth tonight. The juiced baseball has helped to reinvigorate the 29-year-old \u2013 he\u2019s popped 10 home runs in 155 plate appearances. Strikeouts and a low batting average remain a problem for him, rendering Miller something of an all-or-nothing power target. He projects for a one-in-four chance to homer versus Sanchez. Notably, the Nationals righty is not homer prone, although he does have some modest issues with left-handed hitters.\n\nKhris Davis \u2013 OF \u2013 Oakland Athletics (at Andrew Heaney)\n\nDavis\u2019s largely absentee 2019 campaign has been well-document. While he\u2019s shown a few flashes of life in September, it\u2019s not enough to declare him healthy or effective. However, tonight we\u2019ll get to witness something special \u2013 a matchup between one of the most homer prone pitchers (1.90 HR/9) and a former power-hitting great. Who will win this race to the bottom? Projection systems peg Davis for around 30 percent of a home run, although they largely don\u2019t know how to incorporate the nagging injuries which have clearly affected Khrash.\n\nAlso Consider: Mike Montgomery, Chris Owings, Pablo Reyes, DJ Stewart, Billy McKinney, Ryan McBroom, Sheldon Neuse, Jared Walsh, Rowdy Tellez, Gavin Lux, Justin Smoak\n\nMID-TIER MUST PLAYS\n\nFranmil Reyes \u2013OF \u2013 Cleveland Indians (at Ross Detwiler)\n\nLast night, the White Sox sacrificed Hector Santiago to the Indians offense, leaving him in for four innings despite allowing seven runs and three deep flies. They\u2019re likely to do the same with Detwiler. He\u2019s a bad lefty with a 6.98 ERA in 59.1 innings. More importantly, he\u2019s an extremely homer prone (2.73 HR/9) ground ball pitcher. As a fly ball hitter, Reyes should feast. Multiple home runs are not out of the question. In fact, Reyes has the best chance to homer tonight.\n\nAlso Consider: Matt Chapman, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Yasiel Puig\n\nHIGH PRICED VALUES\n\nShane Bieber \u2013 SP \u2013 Cleveland Indians (at White Sox)\n\nOne of the most challenging things about the last week of the season is finding pitchers who can be reliably counted upon to toss a full outing. With the Indians just half a game back on a Wild Card slot, they have to go all out. That includes setting Bieber loose. Of course, if they build an imposing lead \u2013 as they did last night \u2013 a good Bieber outing could still end after five frames. Like any high strikeout rate pitcher, he matches up well against a volatile White Sox offense. As a team, they have one of the most extreme combinations of many strikeouts and few walks. Expect around seven innings and nine punch outs.\n\nAlso Consider: Jacob deGrom, J.D.
