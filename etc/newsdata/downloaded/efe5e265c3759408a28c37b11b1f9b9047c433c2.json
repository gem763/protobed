REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nThe country has been convulsed by protests since October 20, when its Supreme Electoral Tribunal abruptly suspended the publication of results from an electronic count.\n\nWith 84% of votes counted, polling showed Morales was likely headed to a run-off with chief rival and ex-president Carlos Mesa. But when reporting of the count resumed after a nearly 24-hour pause, Morales had pulled off a razor-thin victory.\n\nThe final, legally-binding vote tally gave him 47.08% of votes to Mesa\u2019s 36.51%, less than a percentage point over the 10-point lead needed to avoid a run-off and giving him another five-year term.\n\n\u201cMorales made a mistake,\u201d Mesa told protesters on Sunday, adding that discontent with the leftist president has been fermenting since voters rejected his attempt to lift term limits in 2016.\n\nA court ruling later gave Morales, who has been in office nearly 14 years and is Latin America\u2019s longest-serving head of state, the green light to run once again.\n\nThe streets of La Paz, which has a million residents, were half-empty on Monday morning, with many shops and schools shuttered. The opposition-controlled mayor\u2019s office was also closed.\n\nRoad blockades mounted by residents using cars, wood planks, rope and even dumpsters were visible in both the middle-class south and working-class north of the city, according to Reuters witnesses.\n\nPeople in Santa Cruz, Bolivia\u2019s agricultural and industrial center, have been on strike since Wednesday of last week.\n\n\u201cWe are demanding that our vote be respected,\u201d said Marta Colque, 32, who works at a daycare center.\n\nMorales wants to \u201cstay forever\u201d, Colque said, as she stood at a blockade in the city center.\n\nThe Bolivian government said on Sunday it planned to agree a deal with the Organization of American States within days to audit the election.\n\nMorales, 60, has said he will go to a second round if irregularities are found, but also that rural supporters could put cities under siege.\n\nHe is set to hold an event in El Alto, north of La Paz, later on Monday.\n\nSlideshow (20 Images)\n\n\u201cThe speed with which this is all happening is striking,\u201d said politics professor Marcelo Arequipa, of San Pablo Catholic University.\n\nWhile on Friday protesters were calling for a second round, now there are some asking for the vote to be annulled, Arequipa said.\n\n\u201c\u2018(Morales) must go\u2019 may come next.\u201d (This story corrects percentage of votes won by Carlos Mesa to 36.51% from 35.51%)", "description": "Protesters blocked roads and shopowners kept their stores shut in La Paz on Monday morning as Bolivians took to the streets in a strike called by the opposition to protest at what they say was fraud at elections giving President Evo Morales a fourth term.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445894234&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R18T", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
