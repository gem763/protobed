A third group of plants were in the middle, including maple, magnolia and rose.\n\nSenior plant pathologist at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), Matthew Comey, said a database compiled from a large number of confirmed samples supplied by gardeners was behind the findings.\n\n\"The RHS has long advised on what plants might be best avoided if honey fungus is a known problem on your plot but this new research, for the first time, also accounts for a plant's popularity in gardens and therefore the diseases' likely true impact,\" he said.\n\n\"Following the planting advice isn't a guarantee against the disease but a sensible precautionary measure akin to practicing good plant hygiene.\"\n\nHoney fungus has been made worse in recent years by warm, dry summers, which make plants more susceptible to attack.\n\nThe fungus colonises and kills a variety of trees and woody plants and once present in a garden can be managed but not eradicated.\n\nThe yellow-brown mushrooms that appear above ground are the fruiting bodies of much larger organisms, which can spread large distances underground.\n\nA specific honey fungus measuring 2.4 miles (3.8 km) across in the Blue Mountains in Oregon is claimed to be the largest living organism on Earth.\n\n\"The honey fungus is part of the recycling of plants,\" said Matthew Comey. \"The dead and dying, the weak, the sick plants, these are the ones that tend to succumb in a forest - and really it's an equilibrium, it's a balance.\n\n\"If people can try and grow plants naturally so they're comfortable with where they are - they're in the right environment, they're in the right place, everything else is good for them, then they're much less likely to succumb.\"", "description": "Citizen scientists have helped shed light on a type of fungi that can spread underground for miles.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C86D/production/_109090315_gettyimages-859747820.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
