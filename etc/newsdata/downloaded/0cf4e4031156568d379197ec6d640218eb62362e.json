The European Union placed an arms embargo on Caracas in November 2017.\n\nThe EU also promised in its statement to hold an aid donor conference with the United Nations next month to raise more funds for Venezuelans, including the 4 million refugees who have fled into neighbouring South American countries.\n\nWashington has been urging the European Union to take a tougher stance on Maduro, who France, the United States and several Latin American nations accuse of installing a dictatorship as the crisis deepens in Venezuela.\n\nU.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams, in Brussels earlier this month to meet EU officials, had told reporters he \u201casked the EU to join us in keeping the pressure\u201d on Maduro because \u201cthey don\u2019t want to give up power\u201d.\n\nUnder Maduro, Venezuela, which has the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves, suffers chronic shortages of medical supplies and has seen its economy ruined.\n\nLike the United States, most of the European Union has publicly backed Venezuelan opposition politician Juan Guaido as the man to help restore democracy. Maduro is accused of human rights violations and rigging the 2018 presidential election.\n\nMaduro calls Guaido a U.S.-backed puppet seeking to oust him in a coup.\n\nHowever, much of the EU\u2019s diplomacy has been focussed on trying to agree a negotiated end to the crisis and move towards a timetable for new presidential elections, so far to no avail.\n\nThe EU called on all parties to come back to negotiations chaired by Norway that Venezuela\u2019s opposition said had ended earlier this month, after Maduro\u2019s government froze its participation.", "description": "The European Union warned on Friday it was ready to impose new economic sanctions on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to hasten change, saying the \"grave situation\" in the country must end with a transition to new elections.", "authors": ["Robin Emmott", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434458619&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0ID", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
