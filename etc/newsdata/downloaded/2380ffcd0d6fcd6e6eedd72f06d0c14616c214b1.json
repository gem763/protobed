It is important.\u2019\n\nSauro and his firm, Enzo Homes Ltd, were yesterday found guilty of contravening a tree preservation order by magistrates in Swansea, south Wales.\n\nThe tree contractor who carried out the illegal felling was fined another \u00a3120,000 for the destruction in the ancient woodlands.\n\nA court heard the towering 90ft tree was estimated to be worth more than \u00a366,000 but, in reality, it was \u201cirreplaceable\u201d.\n\nSauro said the felling was an accident - but a judge ruled he \u201cdeliberately\u201d ordered it to be chopped down to make way for 80 new homes.\n\n(Image: Media Wales)\n\nSauro and his company, Enzo Homes Ltd, were ordered to stump up a fine totalling \u00a3300,000 by a district judge in Swansea, South Wales.\n\nEnzo Homes were fined \u00a3120,000 while Sauro was fined \u00a3180,000.\n\nAnnabel Graham-Paul, prosecuting, said: \u201cThis was an intentional breach or flagrant disregard for the law.\n\n\u201cThe trees felled are irreplaceable natural resources. The soils in the ancient woodland can never be replicated.\n\n\u201cSwansea Council aim to replace the trees within two years but the ancient woodlands are irreplaceable and the redwood is going to take a long time to grow back to its former glory so it is by no means going to be a like for like replacement.\u201d\n\nSwansea Magistrate\u2019s Court heard Sauro made \u201cno financial gain\u201d from felling the trees and is involved with the council\u2019s plans to replant what was cut down.\n\n(Image: WALES NEWS SERVICE)\n\nAlex Goodman, representing Sauro said: \u201cSauro has sourced replacement trees at his own expense which are being carefully nurtured in a nursery.\n\n\u201cThis reflects Sauro\u2019s remorse and regret for what happened.\u201d\n\nDistrict judge Neale Thomas said: \u201cI find it difficult to equate the harm to a monetary value. The harm is much greater.\n\n\u201cIt is inconceivable on this evidence the felling of this tree and the ancient woodland was done in any other way than deliberately.\n\n\u201cThere would have been discussions about how it was to be done, permission obtained to remove the fence and any other preparatory work.\u201d\n\n(Image: Media Wales)\n\n\u201cMr Sauro caused the destruction of these trees in the most obvious way: namely by directing they should be felled.\n\n\u201cThis is a deliberate planned breach of the tree preservation order and in defiance of it\u201d.\n\nSauro and his firm, Enzo Homes Ltd, were found guilty of contravening a tree preservation order.\n\nBoth the company and its director were also ordered to contribute a total of \u00a315,000 towards the prosecution costs.\n\nA court heard the firm were developing 80 houses at the site in Penllergaer Estate, Swansea, when the trees were chopped.\n\nSelf-employed contractor Arwyn Morgan, 50, felled the 90ft tree dating back to 1842 to make way for new houses.\n\n(Image: Media Wales)\n\nMorgan previously pleaded guilty to contravening a tree preservation order at Swansea magistrates.\n\nThe father-of-three was fined \u00a3120,000 and ordered to contribute \u00a32,000 toward the prosecution costs.\n\nThe magnificent high tree was planted in 1842 - around 10 years before redwood seeds are credited with being brought to Britain from America.\n\nIt was planted by keen botanist John Dillwyn Llewelyn who imported trees from all over the world.\n\nSwansea council received an anonymous phone call in November last year saying trees had been felled.", "description": "Fiorenzo Sauro, 49, had 70 protected trees illegally felled to build 80 homes, magistrates in Swansea heard", "authors": ["Image", "Wales News Service", "Media Wales"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20587635.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-WNS_151019_Giant_Redwood_Chopped_33JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
