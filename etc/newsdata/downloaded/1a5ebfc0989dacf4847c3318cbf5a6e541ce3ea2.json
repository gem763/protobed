The man once rumoured to be \"Zuma\u2019s spy\", 48-year-old Dlomo has been missing for almost nine months. The State Security Agency (SSA), his employer until very recently, cannot find him.\n\nThe alternative, as any good spy novelist will tell you, is probably a kidnapping by a nefarious foreign enemy or worse, and would undoubtedly draw the attention of the police. Since the Hawks confirmed to News24 that they have not been drawn into the fray, it is safe to assume that this is not a \"missing persons\" case. Yet.\n\nSo where in the world is Thulani Dlomo?\n\nDlomo was fired by the SSA last week, after being AWOL since his return from Japan, where he was South Africa\u2019s ambassador, in January this year. Before his posting to Tokyo, Dlomo headed the SSA\u2019s infamous Special Operations (SO) unit, later found by an independent review to have served the interests of former president Jacob Zuma.\n\nDlomo has occupied several addresses in Durban over the last twelve years. News24 visited them this week, and discovered that he is as elusive as ever.\n\nThe quiet suburb and the Merc\n\nDlomo has used an address in a quiet suburb called Yellow Wood, Durban, on-and-off from around 2009 to 2017. Deeds office records show that Dlomo sold this house in 2015, and its current owner claims not to know him.\n\nThe small property is nestled down a grass embankment, in a quiet street of mostly upmarket homes. It is an unassuming house: grey, with a high fence, and two pitbulls lounging on the porch.\n\nThe curtains are open, cars are in the driveway, and laundry is on the line. Someone is home. The pitbulls make up for the lack of a doorbell.\n\nThere are security cameras all over the property \u2013 on the walls and at the entrances. A Mercedes-Benz and a Toyota Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) with a trailer attached are in the driveway. It is said that Dlomo still drives one of the SSA\u2019s Mercs, and that he has been travelling in and out of the country.\n\nThere are some animal skins on the roof.\n\nThe dogs next door, not to be outdone by their effervescent neighbours, bark even louder, just as this journalist\u2019s efforts to stay upright on the steep grass embankment in the rain degenerate from the comical to the life-threatening.\n\nOver the deafening barking, a neighbour shouts that there is a lady who lives in the grey house. Her name is \"Dlomo\", the neighbour says. Her first name is \"Linda\". The woman will not come out to talk to you, the neighbour sighs.\n\nBingo.\n\n\"Dlomo\", the security paraphernalia, the Mercedes-Benz, the trailer\u2026 This must be the missing spy\u2019s hideout.\n\nBut it is a man called Linda Mhlongo who emerges from the house a day later, with a little encouragement from a different neighbour.\n\nMhlongo insists he does not know any Thulani Dlomo. But deeds records show that Mhlongo bought the property in 2015 from Dlomo, who bought the house in 2009.\n\nAnyone home?\n\nA more likely place for Dlomo to be hiding out, and his current address, is a modest block of flats in central Durban. It was listed as Dlomo\u2019s address as recently as September this year, and he has used the address since 2015.\n\nIt is likely that this is where Dlomo lived when he was running the SOU (having been appointed there in 2012), before he left for Tokyo in 2017.\n\nIt is also the address of a Christian women\u2019s network run by his wife.\n\nThe building, no more than eight units, is, barely big enough to take up more than a third of the block. It is situated on a busy side street, around the corner from a shopping centre. You would drive right past it if you weren\u2019t looking for it.\n\nPerhaps Dlomo took former finance minister Pravin Gordhan's call for South Africans to tighten their belts seriously, because this is not the kind of place one would expect to find a very senior government employee.\n\nThe Dlomo\u2019s unit number\u2019s doorbell rings and rings. Neighbours say they have never heard of Thulani Dlomo. The guardsman on the property and the security guard don\u2019t know who he is, either.\n\nThe flat is owned by Oarabile Dlomo, Dlomo\u2019s wife, and a relative. Social media depicts a deeply religious woman, hands raised in the air in euphoric hallelujahs. Records show that Oarabile Dlomo started working at the SSA in at least May 2019, possibly earlier, just months after her husband returned from Japan. Clearly, even God needs spies.\n\nShe could not be reached for comment this week.\n\nSupernatural skills\n\nBut there is another address for Dlomo that stands out.\n\nIn 2017, about a month after his arrival in Japan, Dlomo listed as one of his addresses a derelict building in Durban, with boarded up windows, which is the registered address of KwaZulu-Natal Security Services.\n\nIts sole director is Shadrack Sibongiseni Dladla. Dladla is a director of a company with strong ANC ties called Reshebile Aviation and Protection Services. City Press reported in 2018 that the company had controversially been awarded tenders to provide security at all the country\u2019s airports.\n\nEither Dlomo was living in the otherwise abandoned building while being in Japan at the same time \u2013 taking his spy skills to supernatural levels \u2013 or he had some connection to Dladla\u2019s security companies while being an ambassador at the same time. Dladla could not be reached for comment.\n\nWith Dlomo nowhere in sight, there were three more addresses worth pursuing. One in another modest suburb, Montclair \u2013 a small, sweet house in a cul-de-sac \u2013 in which no one had ever heard of Dlomo. Another modest block of flats nearby returned the same result. The last address was another block of flats near Durban North Beach, even more modest than all the others, where no one was home, either.\n\nAll of Dlomo\u2019s phone numbers went unanswered this week, except for one \u2013 the SSA\u2019s landline. News24 asked to speak to one Thulani Dlomo. The operator, predictably, was silent.", "description": "Thulani Dlomo has been missing for nearly nine months.
