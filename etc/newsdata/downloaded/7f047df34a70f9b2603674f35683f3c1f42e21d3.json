In the past, the media could gin up enough hysteria to drive down Trump\u2019s approval numbers, at least until the public figured out it was all fake news.\n\nIn fact, in the Rasmussen daily tracking poll, the most accurate poll of the 2016 presidential election, shows Trump\u2019s job approval rating has not only climbed from 45 to 49 percent over the last four days, his approval rating is four points higher than Barack Obama\u2019s was on this same day during his failed presidency.\n\nObviously, these numbers can change, but we are now in the second week of Ukraine Hoax Hysteria, so as these numbers stand today, they are worthy of note.\n\nOne conclusion you might make from them is that time is not on the side of the media and Democrats, is not on this side of this absurd impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe plan, obviously, was to blitzkrieg the public into backing impeachment, which would force Republicans to go along with public opinion.\n\nFor days and days and days we were hit 24/7 with screaming headlines and secret testimony that resulted in damaging (and selective) leaks\u2026 There is just no question the media and Democrats thought they had learned from the mistakes of the Russia coup and the plot to destroy Brett Kavanaugh: 1) Move fast, 2) hide your accuser\u2019s (the whistleblower\u2019s) true identity, and 3) do as much as possible in secrecy.\n\nTrump, though, outsmarted them by releasing the transcript of his call with the Ukrainian president, which none of his enemies expected him to do because they were sure it was a smoking gun.\n\nWell, it wasn\u2019t, but watching the media roll out their game plan as though the president had not released the transcript is more than a little amusing. I mean, now that we\u2019ve seen the transcript, stories, like this, that were obviously written two weeks ago under the assumption Trump would never give up the transcript, actually make me laugh out loud.\n\nTrump is also outsmarting the Democrats and the media by refusing to cooperate with what he correctly refers to as a kangaroo court. Good grief, this so-called whistleblower, who we already know is a registered Democrat, who we already know colluded with Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) to create the complaint, who we already know benefited by a sudden Deep State rule change to facilitate his complaint, who we already know is a crony of Joe Biden\u2019s(!!!), wants to testify in secret \u2014 which is the stuff of banana republics.\n\nThis is not a legitimate inquiry, not even close. Somehow the media and Democrats came up with something that is even more of a partisan witch hunt than the Russia Hoax, and I just don\u2019t see the American people seeing something so toxically partisan and perversely secretive as legitimate.\n\nFurthermore, if Democrats actually had the goods on Trump, if the media actually had the goods on the Orange Bad Man, they wouldn\u2019t have to play all these games in secret and spread all these lies.\n\nIf anything, Trump\u2019s remarkably steady approval rating show us the public is in wait-and-see mode. Democrats might be consolidating their own voters to push up the polls backing impeachment, but the public at large appears to be waiting for the evidence\u2026\n\nAnd since there is none, Trump is smart to obstruct and delay, smart to treat this coup with the contempt it deserves, because the longer the public is forced to stare at this Potemkin Impeachment, the more they will see it is based on bluff, hysteria, media bias, a desire to meddle in the 2020 election, and stark-raving fear of what the upcoming Inspector General reports are going to say about the Obama administration\u2019s appalling, illegal, and unprecedented spying on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
