REUTERS/Sukree Sukplang\n\nAn apparent early-morning North Korean missile test only reinforced the flight, nudging the Japanese yen, Swiss franc and gold slightly higher.\n\nData released overnight showed the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in September to its weakest level in more than a decade and sent the greenback sharply lower from a more than two-year high.\n\nIt nursed those losses on Wednesday, drifting down to 0.9923 Swiss francs, after broaching parity, and falling slightly to 107.64 yen.\n\nThe dollar was marginally weaker at $1.0940 per euro and fell against the Australian and New Zealand dollars, retracing some of its large Tuesday gains, while the equities market tumbled.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management had said its index of U.S. factory activity fell to 47.8, the lowest reading since June 2009. A figure below 50 signals the domestic factory sector is contracting.\n\n\u201cWhile the data... represented a negative surprise in the sense that it came in below consensus expectations, in other ways the industrial slowdown is not a surprise at all,\u201d BNY Mellon analysts said in a note, pointing to Sino-U.S. trade tensions and signs of a slowdown around the world.\n\nThe manufacturing number is a bad omen for September U.S. labour figures due on Friday, since moves are often correlated, the bank said.\n\nBNY Mellon said that while the Fed \u201cstubbornly\u201d feels rates are appropriate for an economy that continues to perform well, \u201cit will ultimately have to accept that the pillars of support - the labour market and the consumer - are weakening.\u201d\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies the dollar was slightly weaker at 99.087, after hitting a two-year high of 99.667 overnight.\n\nThe pound drifted lower to $1.2296. That has it heading back towards an almost one-month low hit overnight as traders are increasingly nervous about Britain crashing out of the European Union at the end of the month.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson will unveil his final Brexit offer to the European Union on Wednesday and make clear that Britain intends to leave the EU on Oct. 31, no matter what.\n\nThe Australian dollar, which hit its lowest in a decade on Tuesday after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut interest rates and kept the possibility of further easing alive, bounced a little to $0.6708. But few are expecting a sustained rise.\n\n\u201cA comparison of yesterday\u2019s and September\u2019s post\u2011meeting RBA statement suggests yesterday\u2019s statement is, if anything, slightly more dovish,\u201d said Joe Capurso, senior currency strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.\n\n\u201cWe expect the RBA to cut the cash rate again in February 2020,\u201d he said.\n\nTrading could be subdued in Asia on Wednesday time because China\u2019s financial markets are closed until Monday for public holidays. In offshore trade, the Chinese yuan was steady at 7.1448 per dollar.", "description": "Worries about a slowing U.S. economy and the possibility of further interest rate cuts in the wake of weak U.S. manufacturing data kept the dollar pinned down on Wednesday, as investors sought safety elsewhere.", "authors": ["Tom Westbrook", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436068365&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9101S", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
