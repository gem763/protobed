The band couldn\u2019t have taken offense at the title\u2014it was drawn from one of Jagger\u2019s own salacious compositions, albeit an officially unreleased one\u2014but rather at the entire over-the-top nature of the film. The Stones evidently wanted to be seen as outlaws, but only inasmuch as they could control and contain that image. In addition to showing a less savory side of the Stones than they might have preferred, Cocksucker Blues isn\u2019t aurally flattering either. It\u2019s an undercooked feast for the ears, full of incidental, ambient sounds: scraping, scratching mumbling, full of the noises that are usually edited out of documentaries, or professionally avoided in the first place. But as with the visuals, there\u2019s a method to Frank\u2019s sonic madness. Passages of sound collage dissolve into visceral concert recordings, including a searing onstage performance with Stevie Wonder as the band\u2019s guest. If vanity was at play in the Stones\u2019 decision to ban the movie, they did themselves a disservice. (Upon Frank\u2019s death, though, the band did issue a glowing statement in remembrance.)\n\nIn addition to allowing Frank to film them for a documentary, the Stones chose as the cover of Exile an outtake from The Americans, Frank\u2019s pioneering 1958 book of photography. The latter is a tour de force of the quotidian, the everyday elevated to the grace of classicism. Stunning contrasts between blacks, whites, and washes of gray render light itself as an object of contemplation. And Frank\u2019s human subjects are imbued with the nobility of statuary. That said, there is no living poor with style in The Americans; there is only realness, illuminating and shadow-draped all at once. The book, resonant with the Beats and containing a preface by Jack Kerouac, helped establish the sensibility and visual language of the emerging counterculture. Frank was there at the beginning of what eventually became the hippie movement, and he was there to capture its decline as emblemized by the Stones. It\u2019s telling that of all Frank\u2019s pictures Jagger and company could have chosen for the cover of Exile, they picked a grid-like collage of circus performers and carnival freaks titled \u201cTattoo Parlor\u201d that makes its inhabitants seem caged.\n\n\u201cThere are too many images, too many cameras now,\u201d Frank once told Vanity Fair. \u201cWe\u2019re all being watched. It gets sillier and sillier. As if all action is meaningful. Nothing is really all that special. It\u2019s just life. If all moments are recorded, then nothing is beautiful and maybe photography isn\u2019t an art any more. Maybe it never was.\u201d As cynical as that sentiment sounds, there\u2019s a strident idealism at the heart of it. Frank pioneered the use of the photograph\u2014both still and moving\u2014as a means by which to document the ephemeral, the transgressive, and the uncomfortable as well as the beautiful. He knew that careful composition could bring about the most naturalist state, and that the lens can find truth not just in the spectacular, but also in the mundane.", "description": "A controversial film about the band directed by the late photographer is an off-kilter masterpiece that reveals his singular eye.", "authors": ["Jason Heller"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/h_14.19993900/facebook.jpg?1568234175", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
