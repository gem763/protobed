The budget carrier plans to raise cash through common and preferred shares.\n\nPhilippines AirAsia was looking at a $600 million valuation and had planned to raise $200 million this year to buy aircraft acquisition and expand its routes.\n\nIt aims to grow revenues by 39% to a record 29 billion pesos ($560 million) by carrying 10 million passengers this year, said Philippines AirAsia vice chairman Shiela Romero.\n\nThe airline, which started its Philippine operations in 2012, has a fleet of 23 Airbus aircraft catering to Philippine and foreign routes.", "description": "The Philippine unit of AirAsia Bhd is postponing its initial public offering (IPO) to next year or 2021 as it focuses on corporate reorganization and seeking funds from existing shareholders, its chairman said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Neil Jerome Morales", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438704593&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9807Z", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
