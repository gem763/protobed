A no-deal exit would release U.K. phone companies from that ban, and the government warning suggests carriers are ready to take advantage by reintroducing roaming fees.\n\nThe documents say telecom companies will have to \u201ctake reasonable steps\u201d to keep customers from incurring roaming charges without realizing it. It\u2019s an issue officials noted a year ago, and at the time they said there would be a charge limit of 45 pounds ($55) a month. There\u2019s no word on whether that cap would still be in place.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jennifer Ryan in London at jryan13@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Thomas Pfeiffer at tpfeiffer3@bloomberg.net, John Lauerman, Marthe Fourcade\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- If you\u2019re anywhere near the Northern Irish border during a no-deal Brexit, keep an eye on your mobile phone bills.People who live or travel near the border may be affected by \u201cinadvertent roaming\u201d signals on their phones, according to U.K. government documents published Tuesday.One of", "authors": ["Jennifer Ryan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
