(Jorge Silva/Reuters)\n\nThe president defied political temptation and did the right thing by walking away from the table.\n\nA couple of years ago, opponents of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential bid warned that a Trump presidency would be a crazy spectacle. Jeb Bush famously said that Trump was a chaos candidate who would be a chaos president.\n\nSome even conjured various wild scenarios that might unfold under a President Trump. They said it might look something like this: As tensions flared in some hot spot \u2014 the Middle East or maybe along the India\u2013Pakistan border \u2014 or as the president conducted perilous negotiations with, say, North Korea, he would be distracted or bedeviled with some sort of domestic scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know if anybody predicted the specific details of Wednesday\u2019s cavalcade of crazy, but if they did, they should collect their door prize.\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former \u201cfixer\u201d and vice president of the Trump Organization, owed his career to the fact that he would happily be his boss\u2019s pet snake. By his own admission, Cohen proudly did the president\u2019s \u201cdirty deeds\u201d (his words), likening himself to the Tom Hagen character in The Godfather. He threatened anyone who crossed Trump, paid off inconvenient women, and boasted with a loser\u2019s false courage how he would take a bullet for his boss. He celebrated, with an alacrity rarely matched by Stalin\u2019s henchmen, his employer\u2019s near-superhuman genius and empathy.\n\nThen, on Wednesday, as he stopped by Congress before he heads to prison, he shed his old skin, the way snakes can, and tried on a new role of martyr and moralist. It\u2019s possible his professed redemption is sincere. It certainly seemed like it at times. But one needn\u2019t be a cynic to doubt it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless, Cohen\u2019s testimony seemed designed to simultaneously enrage the president in every way possible and ingratiate himself with his left-wing critics. Cohen impugned the president\u2019s character, his intelligence, honesty, and wealth. He called Trump a draft-dodging racist and grifter. If I had to guess, his testimony was framed in the best way possible to compensate for the fact that Cohen could not corroborate the most extreme versions of the Russia-collusion theory, which is a political Holy Grail for Democrats and much of the media.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump was in Hanoi, Vietnam \u2014 a locale he studiously avoided visiting in his youth by claiming to have bone spurs \u2014 to negotiate with the murderous dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong-un.\n\nThe summit, like the first one, was ill-considered. It rested on the assumption that Trump, the world\u2019s greatest dealmaker, could charm Kim and the North Korean regime out of its nuclear program. The worry from foreign-policy experts across much of the ideological spectrum was that Trump would blunder into a deal just for the sake of being able to declare victory. Rumored concessions leaked out in the media as if through an open faucet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, it didn\u2019t happen. The summit was a failure on its own terms, and ironically, that made it a kind of victory for Trump. The political tumult in Washington gave Trump every personal incentive to come up with any deal he could in order to change the subject and have something to boast about. This was, after all, part of the political rationale for his declaration of an emergency to build the wall at the border: It changed the subject from his defeat in the post-government-shutdown budget deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have long argued that the North Koreans can\u2019t be talked out of their nuclear program because their nuclear program is central to the rationale for the regime\u2019s entire existence. It would be like talking Hitler and the Nazi regime out of their desire for conquest and their obsessions with the Jews; it\u2019s simply the nature of the regime. You cannot reason a leopard to abandon its spots. It\u2019s doubtful Trump fully recognizes this yet, but that\u2019s irrelevant. He recognized enough: Any deal he could have gotten with Kim would have been worse than doing what he did \u2014 walk away from the table. Whether he came to this conclusion on his own or was cajoled into it by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton is irrelevant, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne can rightly bemoan or lament the fact that the Trump presidency made the Cohen spectacle possible in the first place. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the president defied political temptation and did the right thing.\n\n\u00a9 Tribune Content Agency LLC\n\nSomething to Consider If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.
