Sometimes there will be one or two extra at some point in year.\n\nIs this all about getting me to spend more money?\n\nYes, almost entirely. The iPhone event is always Apple's most product focused event, and in recent years those iPhones have been getting more and more expensive.\n\nBut you'll get something out of the event even if your wallet (and your old iPhone) stays in your pocket. Apple should also announce the release date for its new iOS 13 operating system, which will bring new features to older devices too, for free.\n\nHow do I watch along?\n\nApple has gradually made it easier to watch with each passing year. As such, this is the easiest yet.\n\nChief among the reasons is the fact that the company is finally putting the live stream on YouTube. That is undoubtedly the easiest way to watch.\n\nBut it's also offering people the chance to watch along in a variety of other ways, too.\n\nFor all the details on watching live click here.\n\nIs it worth watching it live?\n\nThe events can be long \u2013 sometimes very long. And while there's lots of spectacular goings on to fill the time, there can also be a lot of bits that aren't really necessary to watch in detail.\n\nMost likely, you already know if you're going to be watching along: if you want to know everything about the new phone, and everything else as soon as you can, then it's definitely worth catching. If those things aren't true, and you're not , then watch along after.\n\nYou'll still be able to get all of the same information if you watch after \u2013 Apple always posts the full keynote online afterwards. And that has the advantage of letting you skip through any parts that aren't especially thrilling.\n\nIs this when the iPhone actually comes out?\n\nNo, probably not. It's likely that the iPhone and any other products won't actually arrive for a couple of weeks, as is usual, to give them time to arrive at the Apple Store.\n\nWhat will happen soon after the event is that pre-orders will open, giving people the chance to put down money for the new phone. In previous years, that was incredibly important \u2013 but lately, and especially when the new phones are relatively similar, it's been much easier to get hold of an iPhone quickly without pre-ordering.\n\nApple will also start giving the phones to those members of the press that it invites to its events. They will then write up reviews a few days after, giving the first real glimpse of whether the phones and other products live up to the promises made during the keynote.\n\nFor all the details on the release date, click here.\n\nWhat is the new iPhone going to look like?\n\nLike the current one, mostly. It will have an extra lens in the camera, and perhaps some more colours, but otherwise it will look identical.\n\nThat applies to all three of the current models, which will be replicated in the current line-up, though they are expected to take different names. The iPhone XR will become the iPhone 11; the XS is rumoured to be known as the iPhone 11 Pro; the XS Max is said to be the iPhone 11 Pro Max.\n\nThe bigger changes are likely to happen on the inside. All of the new phones should get Apple's latest \u2013 and probably much faster \u2013\n\nFor everything you need to know about the new iPhone, have a look here.\n\nWhat else will Apple announce?\n\nGiven the relative lack of changes in the iPhone, it might actually be overshadowed by other devices. The Apple Watch, for instance, could have more dramatic updates than its bigger sibling; Apple could finally reveal the details of its much anticipated streaming services.\n\nFor the full low-down on everything that Apple might announce that's not the iPhone, check here.", "description": "Apple is about to hold its biggest event of the year.
