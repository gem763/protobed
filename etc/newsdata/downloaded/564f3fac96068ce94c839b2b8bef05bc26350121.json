But inside [the ring] there are no friends, there is no respect or anything.\n\n\"It will not be an easy fight. I think it will be a hard fight, but nothing is easy in life, so we are training very hard. We will be prepared for whatever he brings.\"", "description": "Anthony Joshua vs Andy Ruiz Jr will take place in a purpose-built venue which is now being built in Saudi Arabia", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Matchroom Twitter", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584285.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Anthony-Joshua-vs-Andy-Ruiz-Jr-rematch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
