He died in 2010.\n\nThe 66-year-old faces investigations into alleged fraud, money laundering and other allegations, although she enjoys immunity from arrest as a member of Congress and would keep it as vice-president.\n\nShe has often visited Cuba to see daughter Florencia, who has received medical treatment there this year. Her son Maximo is a deputy in Congress and also faces legal problems.\n\nHowever, Kirchner retains immense popularity among Argentines who view her as a champion of the poor.\n\nWarning: Brazil's far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro (pictured at the Japanese imperial enthronement in Tokyo earlier this week) has warned of economic chaos if Kirchner wins\n\nAdvertisements: A series of election posters for Fernandez and Kirchner are seen covered in graffiti in Buenos Aires yesterday\n\nSupporters wear T-shirts bearing her image, refer to her affectionately by her initials CFK and barely mention presidential candidate Fernandez.\n\n'She's the one who has the votes, she makes it all happen,' said Gaston Perez, who waited more than four hours to see her in Buenos Aires.\n\nAt the rally she electrified the crowd, reflecting an emotional connection that eludes most other Argentine politicians.\n\n'If I'm a candidate for vice president, it's not because I want to be vice president. That's clear. I thought of it as a way to help shape a new majority in Argentina,' she said.\n\nHer campaign is tapping into anger over an austerity package imposed by Macri's government as part of a $55billion financing deal with the IMF.\n\nThe current president's supporters counter that the big spending and state intervention under Kirchner's leadership got Argentina into trouble in the first place.\n\nThe stunning results of the primary - a win for Fernandez by nearly 16 points - sparked economic panic and a market sell-off.\n\nOn the day after the primary Argentines rushed to buy dollars as a hedge against possible economic volatility.\n\nIncumbent: Argentina's current president Mauricio Macri (holding the microphone) faces an uphill battle to stay in power\n\nChallenger: Left-wing candidate Alberto Fernandez (pictured during an election debate on Sunday) is expected to win the election with his running mate Kirchner\n\nAfter loud complaints from bankers, consumers and business leaders, the central bank started spending its dollar reserves to bolster the local currency.\n\nMacri's campaign has sought to exploit those fears, arguing that Kirchner would be the puppet master under a new left-wing presidency.\n\n'She'll be the one who governs,' said Miguel Pichetto, Macri's candidate for vice president. 'She's the one who would have power, have no doubt.'\n\nNicolas Trotta, an aide on the Fernandez-Kirchner ticket, dismissed that theory but said the new president would 'gladly consult' his deputy.\n\nAnother analyst, Patricio Giusto, also doubted she would try to sideline Fernandez.\n\n'I don't see Cristina wanting to turn Alberto into a puppet, speaking over him, making her own administrative agenda,' he said.\n\nThe Mercosur trade bloc was established in 1991 and now includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay as full members.\n\nVenezuela was a full member but was expelled in 2016.", "description": "Former Argentine leader Cristina Kirchner (pictured) is the running mate of left-wing candidate Alberto Fernandez and would be widely seen as the power behind the throne if they win the election.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/11/20125468-0-image-a-33_1571911631162.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
