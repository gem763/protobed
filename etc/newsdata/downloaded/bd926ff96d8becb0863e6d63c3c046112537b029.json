As Axios reports, the letter comes after at least twelve top officials were dismissed or resigned from a cybersecurity team that protected the White House from security threats from Russia and other entities.\n\nThis team \u2014 the Office of the Chief Information Security Officer (OCISO) \u2014 was built after the Obama administration was attacked by Russian hackers in 2014. As the memo states, the OCISO \u201cwas established to take on the responsibility of securing the Presidential Information Technology Community (PITC) network.\u201d Since then, the team has \u201csignificantly matured the security posture of PITC and no major compromise has occurred,\u201d according to the memo.\n\nHowever, in July the OCISO was folded into the U.S. Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) \u2014 an entity that is not covered under the Presidential Records Act, which mandates all records be preserved.\n\n\u201cIt is highly concerning that the entire cybersecurity apparatus is being handed over to non-PRA entities,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cThis is a significant shift in the priorities of senior leadership, where business operations and quality of service take precedence over securing the President\u2019s network. As a career cyber security professional, this is alarming.\u201d\n\nVastakis adds that he believes OCISO staff are \u201csystematically being targeted for removal from the Office of the Administration (OA) through various means,\u201d including \u201crevocation of incentives, reducing the scope of duties, reducing access to programs, revoking access to buildings, and revoking positions with strategic and tactic decision making authorities.\u201d\n\nThe security professional concludes his memo by predicting that history will repeat itself. Of course, the biggest question is why? Why hide this group\u2019s actions from official records? Why weaken White House cybersecurity and drive out professionals? Once again, the White House did not immediately respond to Gizmodo\u2019s questions and we\u2019ll update this post when it does.", "description": "In the 1,006 days since Donald Trump became president, his administration has shown little vigilance\u00a0when it comes to its own security, and a new internal memo suggests the White House is working to weaken its own cybersecurity safeguards....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Alex Choros"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/otp2icrx30sihirxourc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
