In it, the authors outline how Bloom offered advice to Weinstein in memos on how to \u201chelp you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Rose McGowan: 'Lisa Bloom Should Be Disbarred' for Working With Harvey Weinstein\n\n\u201cWe can place an article re: her becoming increasingly unglued,\u201d Bloom suggested in the memo, \u201cso that when someone Googles her this is what pops up and she\u2019s discredited.\u201d\n\nBloom, who apologized to Weinstein\u2019s accusers in 2017, issued another apology after the book was published. But McGowan called the lawyer\u2019s actions \u201cmind bending and illegal\u201d on social media and called for her to be disbarred.\n\nThe lawsuit also names the spy firm Black Cube as a defendant, calling it part of the \u201cWeinstein Protection Enterprise\u201d that was designed to protect Weinstein from any sexual abuse accusations that might come to light.\n\nAlso Read: Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan: We Are Not Part of Harvey Weinstein's $44 Million Settlement\n\nThe suit outlines how Black Cube obtained a draft of McGowan\u2019s memoir, in which she planned to go public about her abuse at Weinstein\u2019s hands at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. It alleges that the spy, known to McGowan as Diana Filip, gained her trust by posing as an advocate. The spy later recorded her conversations with McGowan and stole a draft of the memoir from her laptop.\n\n\u201cMcGowan has suffered tremendously from Defendants\u2019 conspiracy and lies,\u201d concludes the lawsuit. \u201cHer book sales suffered; her expenses mounted; her job opportunities vanished; and her emotional health cratered. She has experienced trauma and depression from Defendants\u2019 actions, and the deep betrayal will have life-long effects.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for the defendants did not immediately respond to TheWrap\u2019s request for comment.\n\nPamela Chelin contributed to this report.\n\nRead original story Rose McGowan Accuses Harvey Weinstein and His Ex-Lawyers of Racketeering in New Lawsuit At TheWrap", "description": "Rose McGowan has filed a racketeering lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein and attorneys David Boies and Lisa Bloom, accusing them of conspiring to discredit her sexual assault claims against the disgraced film producer.\u201cThis case is about a diabolical and illegal effort by one of America\u2019s most powerful", "authors": ["Jeremy Fuster"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9V3.5sZb2eqkX91EGFMi1w--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/379dee11b699cc7ac1966171111ad321", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
