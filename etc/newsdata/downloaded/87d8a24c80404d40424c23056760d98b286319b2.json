The cash market Dow is also down over 250 points.\n\nSellers started to hit the Dow during the pre-market session after the South China Morning Post reported China is toning down its expectations ahead of trade negotiations with the United States. Although most investors don\u2019t expect a major announcement following the October 10-11 meeting, some were hoping for a \u201cmini-deal\u201d.\n\nOne sticking point is President Trump is looking for a broad deal and China is willing to accept a partial deal. Traders are also saying they expect China to retaliate against the U.S. for blacklisting additional Chinese technology firms.\n\nAt 13:50 GMT, December E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are trading 26170, down 271 or -1.02%.\n\nDaily December E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average More\n\nDaily Technical Analysis\n\nThe main trend is down according to the daily swing chart. A trade through 25703 will signal a resumption of the downtrend.\n\nThe minor trend is also down. A trade through 26615 will change the minor trend to up. This will also shift momentum to the upside.\n\nThe main range is 25014 to 27312. Its retracement zone at 26163 to 25892 is potential support.\n\nThe short-term range is 27312 to 25703. Its retracement zone at 26508 to 26697 is resistance. This area stopped the rally at 26615 on Monday.\n\nDaily Technical Forecast\n\nBased on the early price action and the current price at 26170, the direction of the December E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average the rest of the session on Tuesday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the main 50% level at 26163.\n\nBullish Scenario\n\nHolding 26163 will indicate the return of buyers. If this move creates enough upside momentum, we could see a retest of the short-term 50% level at 26508, followed by the minor top at 26615, the short-term Fibonacci level at 26697 and the downtrending Gann angle at 26768.\n\nBearish Scenario\n\nA break under 26163 will indicate the selling is getting stronger. The first target angle comes in at 26087. If this angle fails as support, the selling is likely to extend into another angle at 25895, the main Fibonacci level at 25892, a Gann angle at 25799 and the main bottom at 25703.\n\nTaking out the long-term uptrending Gann angle at 25718 could trigger an acceleration to the downside.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "Based on the early price action and the current price at 26170, the direction of the December E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average the rest of the session on Tuesday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the main 50% level at 26163.", "authors": ["James Hyerczyk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MbchWSVrtob73P7G6GhBiQ--~B/aD00MDI7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/fa1315448f0e2c81b8f566cef5776640", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
