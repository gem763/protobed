But something about this current Liverpool squad's never-say-die spirit suggests their current six-point advantage over Manchester City could sustain.\n\nVAR from perfect\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nAnother week of VAR controversy was highlighted by a controversial penalty decision at Brighton which earned the ire of Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker.\n\nEverton appeared to be easing to a priceless away win when VAR decreed Michael Keane had fouled Aaron Connolly in the box - earning the Seagulls a spot-kick which turned the game in their favour.\n\nIt was the first time VAR had been used to award a penalty, and other incidents over the weekend included contentious over-rules and atmosphere-sapping delays after a goal has gone in.\n\nReferencing the intention of only using VAR for clear incidents, Lineker tweeted that technology had gone from \"pole vault heights\" to \"limbo dancing levels\".\n\nPulisic makes his mark\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nIt's been a tricky settling in period for Christian Pulisic in England, but he finally showed what he is capable of with a man of the match display at Turf Moor.\n\nHis treble helped fire Chelsea to a 4-2 victory over Burnley on Saturday as Frank Lampard's fourth-placed side stayed level on points with Leicester and in touch with Liverpool and Manchester City .\n\nThere were rumours the American was already growing frustrated over his lack of minutes, but he's given Lampard the perfect food for thought.\n\nAnd there will no doubt be more to come.\n\nMore penalty problems for Man Utd\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nRashford (2), Martial and Paul Pogba have all missed from the penalty spot now this season for Solskjaer's men, who have missed four of six from the spot.\n\nIt didn't cost them against Norwich, but they need to really nail it down, because it turned a win at Wolves into a draw and a draw with Palace into a defeat.\n\nSolskjaer laughed off his side's failings, and jokingly suggested Rashford had missed his on purpose as a goodwill gesture in response to a controversial VAR call.\n\n\"The first one I don't think is a penalty, if it takes two minutes it's not clear and obvious,\" Solskjaer said. \"But Marcus [Rashford] did the honourable thing and missed it.\"\n\nDifferent Spurs on show - but why?\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSo much has been said about Spurs this season, and just how poor they have been, but their performance against Liverpool was the old Tottenham, the team that belies the critics and defies the odds against them when they take on richer, bigger spending rivals.\n\nThe side which turned up at Anfield could give anyone a game.\n\nThe question is, why does that team not turn up every week these days?\n\nThe answer may be simple. This is the biggest stage, with the world watching, and there are TOO many of their players looking to leave.\n\nThey will inevitably raise their game for these, to increase their profile.\n\nMaybe Tottenham have made a mistake in letting too many top players get to the end of their contracts.\n\nArsenal agony\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nBut for a late Sokratis strike being ruled out by VAR, Arsenal could have been sitting just two points behind Frank Lampard's hyped Chelsea young guns and nine-shooters Leicester in the Premier League table.\n\nInstead, a gap of four points has opened up, and they are left to reflect on tossing away a two-goal lead against Crystal Palace in a match marred by the petulant reaction of captain Granit Xhaka upon being substituted.\n\nThe boos facing Xhaka as he trudged off encapsulated the other issues afflicting the Gunners at the moment, and the impatience of many fans with what they see to be Unai Emery's questionable and inconsistent tactics.\n\nFabulous Foxes\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSome seem almost defeatist in their assumption that the super spending power of the Premier League elite will once again prove the decisive factor in the chase for Champions League places.\n\nNot so Leicester, who under the astute guidance of Brendan Rodgers have harnessed a growing belief that they can repeat - at least to some extent - their stunning title-winning season of 2016.\n\nFriday night's staggering 9-0 win at Southampton simply showcased the stunning emergence of players like James Maddison and Ben Chilwell as bona-fide Premier League stars.\n\nThey currently sit in third place for a reason - the top two apart, the Foxes are the best of the bunch, no matter what the cheque-books would have you believe.\n\nOdds against Hasenhuttl\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWhilst it would be wrong to judge Ralph Hasenhuttl's reign at Southampton on one result, the 9-0 drubbing by Leicester on home soil is bound to cause some serious damage.\n\nThe Austrian did a decent job of steering the Saints away from the drop zone last season, but he is now the favourite to be the next Premier League manage to leave his post.\n\nSouthampton are struggling and find themselves in the bottom three with just one win from their last six.\n\nThere is going to be some serious soul searching at St Mary's this week as they try and piece themselves back together after the crunching defeat.\n\nAt least they have the Carabao Cup tie in midweek to take their minds off things...\n\n...against Man City.\n\nCheque-book woes for Magpies\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAsk Newcastle fans if money guarantees success.\n\nAfter urging Mike Ashley to dip into his considerable cash-flow, the Magpies appear to have been landed with two almighty flops.\n\nFor their combined \u00a361million price tag, Miguel Almiron and Joelinton have summoned a single goal so far this season and continued to look woefully inadequate in Sunday's draw with Wolves.\n\nHome-grown brothers Sean and Matty Longstaff, in contrast, have given long-suffering north-east fans the biggest cause for optimism this season.\n\nIf Steve Bruce is to win over his doubters and steer his side to Premier League safety, he will know which of those two pairs he can best rely on.\n\nMilivojevic is Arsenal\u2019s bogeyman yet again\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nMaybe Luka Milivojevic is a Tottenham fan?\n\nThe Serbian penalty expert made no mistake yet again from the spot against the Gunners, and amazingly this was his fifth goal in six games against Arsenal, who he seems to relish playing against.\n\nIt was also the 21st penalty he has successfully converted in his career, with only three missed, while Palace have scored more goals from penalties than any other team since their return to the Premier League in 2013 (39)\n\nMilivojevic is surely the most accomplished penalty taker in the whole league along with Harry Kane, and considering Palace\u2019s struggle for goals, it is a good job their number four is so lethal from 12 yards.", "description": "PLUS: Leicester equal goal scoring record, Newcastle's forwards not firing, and Chelsea's new boy makes his mark", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Pa", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20727147.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-ENG-PR-SOUTHAMPTON-LEICESTER.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
