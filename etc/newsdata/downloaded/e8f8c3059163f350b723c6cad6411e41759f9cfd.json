One by one, United\u2019s players filed out of the Old Trafford dressing room in silence until, by the end, there was just Crerand and his manager left.\n\nThe pair had grown close over the years but Crerand had not seen his fellow Scot like this before. \u201cHe was going to quit, he was going to give up at the end of the season and, I think, retire from football,\u201d Crerand recalled this week.\n\n\u201cHe was so down after that game, you wouldn\u2019t believe it. You have to remember he was the man who took on the Football League secretary Alan Hardaker and instigated English teams in Europe and here he was mumbling about never winning the European Cup. I told him we would. \u2018We\u2019ll win it next year boss, we\u2019ll win it next year\u2019.\u201d\n\nIt was never mentioned but the memory of Munich and the air crash that had claimed 23 lives eight years earlier had hung over that tie against Partizan and seemed to amplify Busby\u2019s emotional distress. Belgrade, and the Partizan Stadium, had been the scene of United\u2019s dramatic 3-3 draw against Red Star in February 1958, when the Busby Babes booked their place in the European Cup semi-finals only for tragedy to strike after that ill-fated refuelling stop on the way home at Munich-Riem airport.\n\nReturning to Belgrade with a team rebuilt out of the ashes of one of football\u2019s worst disasters was always going to be an acutely sensitive experience for the crash survivors, Busby, Bobby Charlton, Bill Foulkes and Harry Gregg. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any mention of \u201858 on the plane but people were thinking about it. It was there,\u201d Crerand said. \u201cI think only they could tell you what they were feeling.\u201d", "description": "Even now, 53 years on from the last time Manchester United and Partizan Belgrade met in Europe, Paddy Crerand can picture Matt Busby, crushed, despairing and emotionally spent.", "authors": ["James Ducker", "Northern Football Correspondent", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000213909209-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOO1DkfkdgLE_z8gnRL4Qgf35SWLtOllAYRC1UMyWsZc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
