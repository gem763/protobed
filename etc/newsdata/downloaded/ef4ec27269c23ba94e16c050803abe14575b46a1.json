(David Burke/CBC)\n\n\"It was a shame to watch it happen because we knew it was someone's property, possibly someone's livelihood,\" said Lowe, adding that he's not sure who is responsible for cleaning up the mess.\n\n\"It was pretty surprising.... We just thought how terrible it was and we were just worried about what was happening over on the cove side.\"\n\nDarrell Power, who also lives in Herring Cove, said he was one of many people in the area who lost wharfs and sheds.\n\nHe said boats were smashing against the shoreline Saturday, and some of those are likely damaged.\n\n\"This blue boat and white boat were just like dinky toys in the water. I've never seen anything like it, and 65 years I've been here,\" said Power, standing on a breakwater scattered with large boulders Sunday morning.\n\nHerring Cove was also badly hit by Hurricane Juan in 2003, a powerful storm that caused widespread damage and days-long power outages.\n\nDorian brought boulders onto a breakwater in Herring Cove, N.S.

Police closed the road, which is the main highway between Glace Bay and Sydney.

(CBC)\n\nThe Kejimkujik National Park on Nova Scotia's South Shore will be closed until further notice because there's no power in the park and there are many downed trees, as well as broken trunks and branches that pose a safety risk to visitors. Parks Canada will provide an update on Wednesday at noon AT.\n\nShelley Allen, who lives in Queensland, N.S., said Conrads Road \u2014 which has been battered by past storms \u2014 was generally not impacted by Dorian.\n\n\"It wasn't as bad as I expected,\" said Allen, adding that her driveway washed out.\n\nHillary Harris, who lives on Preston Street in Halifax, said her family was watching as the storm lashed a large tree in front of their home.\n\nEmergency officials were asking people to stay off roads in the Halifax area, where many streets were littered with downed trees and power lines. (Eric Woolliscroft/CBC)\n\n\"We were looking at this tree outside our house and noticing that the trunk was wobbling a bit, sort of like a wiggly tooth,\" said Harris, standing on her deck in front of the uprooted tree.\n\n\"The paving stones started lifting. We could see the ground coming up, and that was really worrying. At one point we all ran to the back of the house.\"\n\nHarris said the tree then started to fall, taking power lines down with it.\n\n\"It was exciting and scary and we were sort of helpless to do anything,\" she said. \"I've never seen anything like it.\"\n\nEmily Townsend said her community of Ketch Harbour, N.S., was hit hard.\n\nPowerful storm surge scattered debris across a road in Ketch Harbour, N.S.

(David Burke/CBC)\n\nMartha Elkins and her husband Lyle live along Shore Road, just across from the ocean. As the storm roared into the region Saturday, it started flicking baseball-size stones across the road and onto their property.\n\n\"A little bit frightening, but I've been through several hurricanes, it was not the worst,\" said Martha Elkins.\n\n\"There was so much water in the front of our yard here it almost went up to our steps,\" her husband added.\n\nMartha Elkins said \"storm gawkers\" then began pulling up next to their home.\n\n\"It was a circus. During the height of the storm there were sometimes 12 cars in front of the yard,\" she said, adding that those people put themselves in danger, and she feels such roads should be closed during bad storms.\n\nThe lack of power prompted people in the Halifax area to descend upon open Tim Hortons restaurants for breakfast Sunday morning. Dozens of cars could be seen lined up on streets in Halifax and Dartmouth.\n\nPost-hurricane Tim Hortons lineup in Halifax, Nova Scotia <a href=\"https://t.co/7FveuuHqjk\">pic.twitter.com/7FveuuHqjk</a> \u2014@Brett_CBC\n\nEmergency officials said such lineups were blocking roads and obstructing cleanup efforts.
