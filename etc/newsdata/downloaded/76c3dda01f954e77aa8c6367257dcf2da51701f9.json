But a campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity and without official authorization to discuss the speech, said that Mr Parscale was referring less to possible candidacies in the future and more to activities such as political speeches and fundraising.\n\nThe president and his family have worked aggressively to marginalise or mute whatever anti-Trump sentiment has remained within the national Republican Party.\n\nWhether that influence remains once he is out of office \u2014 and whether the party reverts to its former shape or adopts a new one \u2014 remains an open question.\n\nLongtime supporters of Trump noted that he and some in his family tended to crave flattery, particularly in public settings, and they chalked up the \u201cdynasty\u201d remark from Mr Parscale to puffery.\n\nPrivately, some Republicans \u2014 who did not want to publicly fight with the president\u2019s campaign manager \u2014 dismissed Mr Parscale\u2019s choice of words, noting that the concept of dynastic politics was harmful to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and that it is not a concept historically favoured by populists.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I love aspects of the fight. I don\u2019t know how much I would love aspects of the actual job yet.\u201d\n\nA person close to the younger Trump said he \u201ccurrently has zero interest in running for office\u201d and that his sole political focus is his father\u2019s campaign next year.\n\nStill, the person added that while the younger Trump does not expect to be a candidate himself, he anticipates being involved in Republican politics \u201cfor many years to come.\u201d\n\nIvanka Trump, the president\u2019s elder daughter, is also seen by West Wing aides and people who have worked with the family as harbouring ambitions of her own for elected office.\n\nPeople close to her insist that she has never discussed it, although some of her friends, in private conversations, have been open about the prospect that they see her as a future presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cIf she ever wanted to run for president,\u201d Mr Trump told The Atlantic in a recent interview, \u201cI think she\u2019d be very, very hard to beat.\u201d\n\nLara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, who is actively involved in his re-election campaign, is also mentioned as a possible candidate by some close to the family.\n\nSuch comments make clear that the Trump family hopes to extend its influence into the future. And the remarks touched on two lingering questions about the future of the Trumps: Will any of the president\u2019s children run for office, and will he fade quietly if he loses in 2020, or finishes a second term in 2024?\n\nEven if no other Trump tries to run a campaign, advisers to Mr Trump believe he will remain active \u2014 on his Twitter feed, in television interviews and potentially at political events of his own.\n\nFew believe he is going to cede the spotlight easily, or follow previous presidents in laying low after leaving office.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "President Donald Trump may be the only member of his family to win major elected office, but his campaign manager for the 2020 re-election effort is already envisioning a family political dynasty that will outlast his time in the White House.", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/09/trump-family.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
