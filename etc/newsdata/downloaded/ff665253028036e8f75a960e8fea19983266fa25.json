The letter reveals the deep grudges held by the Biden campaign over the past few months whenever the Times dared to mention anything regarding Biden and Ukraine.\n\nThe letter repeatedly faults The Times for insufficiently burying the Biden-Ukraine scandal.\n\n\u201cBloomberg reported that the investigation of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma on which this Schweizer-Giuliani conspiracy theory is predicated had been \u2018long dormant,\u2019\u201d the letter quibbles, but \u201cThe Times failed to note this crucial development and continued to cover Giuliani\u2019s allegations while depriving readers of this and other essential context, preserving Giuliani\u2019s and Schweizer\u2019s narrative in spite of known facts.\u201d\n\nDid the New York Times not get the Biden campaign\u2019s talking points!? Didn\u2019t every mainstream media outlet agree to express absolutely zero interest in anything related to the Bidens and Ukraine!?\n\n\u201cWe submit that the Times should publicly answer for these failures in reporting on this pressing issue fairly, accurately, and in a way that prioritized truth and judiciousness over sensationalism,\u201d the letter concludes, \u201cWe also believe that these occurrences speak to the urgent need for a restoration of a public editor at the paper.\u201d\n\nMaybe Biden should threaten to wait in the lobby of the New York Times for six hours and see if he can get those responsible for this fired.", "description": "The Biden campaign sent an angry letter to the New York Times Wednesday evening, taking the newspaper to task for investigating the seemingly corrupt dealings of the Biden family in the Ukraine..10/10/2019 14:35:18PM EST.", "authors": ["Bronson Stocking", "Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/151/a96c77b2-4508-487d-a99f-56a3ebe90353.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
