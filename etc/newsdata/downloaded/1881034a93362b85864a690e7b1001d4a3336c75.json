The couple pictured together with their son\n\nYoga instructor Tandi pictured doing some poses next to her husband, Mitchell, while he hunts\n\nThe pair, seen above, are happily married despite their differences - with Tandi's only rule being that Mitchell stores his meat in the garage\n\nFocusing on gaining a healthier lifestyle, Tandi immediately felt revitalized thanks to her new diet and later turned vegan after researching the dairy industry.\n\nAt first Mitchell, who married Tandi in January 2015, a month after her switch to veganism, didn't understand the reasons for his wife's change in eating habits.\n\nBut eventually he started to see things from Tandi's perspective and now only eats meat from animals he has killed using a bow and arrow.\n\nThe couple's four-month-old son, Brooks, is currently being raised a vegan but Tandi says she would not stop him from following in his father's hunting footsteps.\n\nThe couple first met when they were just 16 and it wasn't until four years later that Tandi (pictured) gave up her meat-loving ways to embrace vegetarianism after watching her grandmother pass away from cancer\n\nFocusing on gaining a healthier lifestyle, Tandi (pictured) immediately felt revitalized thanks to her new diet and later turned vegan after researching the dairy industry\n\nAt first Mitchell, who married Tandi (pictured) in January 2015, a month after her switch to veganism, didn't understand the reasons for his wife's change in eating habits\n\n'I was actually raised on a typical American diet - highly processed food with animal products at every meal,' said Tandi. 'But I soon became vegan after realizing the horror of the dairy industry.\n\n'I became so passionate about the positive effects of a vegan diet and I wanted to share it with the world. I understood the negative habits the western world has ,and wanted to be a part of the conscious shift towards healing for all.'\n\nTandi admitted that it was devastating that her husband didn't agree with her at first, but that she tried not to push him.\n\n'I became a vegan a month after we were married,' she said. 'I never looked at his hobbies in an objective way before. Hunting and eating animals are so normalized, I never questioned it.\n\nBut now the couple (pictured with their pet dog and baby boy) are raising their four-month-old son Brooks on a plant-based diet\n\nSpeaking about the decision to raise her son as a vegan, Tandi (pictured recently with her baby boy) added: 'My four-month-old is currently vegan because I am'\n\n'But when the veil of animal agriculture was exposed to me in a new way, I went through a period of being mad at the world. I felt lied to. And my husband and oldest friend didn't make the connection right away. Which was also devastating.\n\n'What saved my marriage was realizing that people will not change if you tell them what they're doing is wrong. You have to lead by example and lead with compassion and understanding.\n\n'When I let the pressure of my husband having the same food values as me go, everything changed and slowly but surely he caught up to me.'\n\nSpeaking about the decision to raise her son as a vegan, Tandi added: 'My four-month-old is currently vegan because I am.\n\nEventually Mitchell (pictured during a hunt, right) started to see things from Tandi's (left) perspective and now only eats meat from animals he has killed using a bow and arrow\n\nTandi admits that the couple (pictured with their pet dog) are sometimes questioned about their contrasting views on animal product consumption\n\n'People think it's really far out. But it works for us because we're able to integrate our values to be the best version of ourselves,' said Tandi (pictured)\n\n'Once he's old enough to understand how food is sourced, he can decide if he wants to eat animal products. But until then he will get all his nutrients from plants.\n\n'I feel like everyone has their own choices. I can only try my best to raise a child who is aware [of hunting], questions things and makes decisions based off his own values. And if they're genuine values I will absolutely support him.'\n\nTandi admits that the couple are sometimes questioned about their contrasting views on animal product consumption but says that their relationship is proof that both vegans and non-vegans can live together.\n\n'People think it's really far out. But it works for us because we're able to integrate our values to be the best version of ourselves,' said Tandi.\n\n'People of the far vegan way and people of the far conservative way seem to have the biggest misunderstanding. We eat whole plant foods plus my husband has deer or grouse, it's quite easy actually. We have dairy-free alternatives as well.\n\n'Everyone is so far on one side of the spectrum. But the truth is everything is not a one size fits all, lifestyle and diet included. We have to integrate. And we must take the best options on both sides and practice them.'", "description": "Yoga instructor Tandi Rolen, 28, from  Washington, met her husband, gunsmith and fishing guide, Mitchell, 28, when they were 16, and turned vegan months after their wedding.", "authors": ["Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/11/19985004-0-image-a-75_1571652297474.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
