Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers, a former marketing executive at Gap Inc. and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. , is leaving the embattled e-cigarette maker.\n\n\u201cCraig Brommers, an incredibly talented marketing executive, has asked to transition out of Juul Labs in the coming months so that he can pursue opportunities with other companies,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement.\n\nMr. Brommers was the company\u2019s first CMO when he joined in April, having most recently served as CMO of Gap\u2019s flagship brand. Juul will now eliminate the post, the spokesman said. He declined to make Mr. Brommers available to comment.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nJuul is undergoing a broader reorganization including marketing cutbacks as it navigates a Federal Trade Commission investigation into its marketing, a proposed U.S. ban on flavors that comprise more than 80% of its sales, and general alarm over a spreading vaping-related illness.\n\nJuul\u2019s products haven\u2019t been tied to the illness, but a recent federal warning to stop using all vaping products has hurt sales.\n\nIn an investigation that began before Mr. Brommers joined Juul, the FTC is examining whether the company used influencers and other marketing to appeal to minors. The company says it never targeted minors, and only ran a small pilot using influencers.\n\nThe company late last month named a new chief executive, K.C. Crosthwaite, and suspended broadcast, print and digital ads for its U.S. products.\n\nProgrammers including CNN, TNT, TBS, Viacom and CBS had already said they would stop taking e-cigarette ads.\n\nJuul ran commercials on TV networks such as Discovery Channel, A&E and the Travel Channel more than 1,500 times in September, according to iSpot.tv. The spots depict former smokers talking about their switch to vaping. Other ads this year have supported raising the minimum age to buy tobacco and vaping products to 21 and described steps that Juul says it has taken to combat youth smoking.\n\nThe company plans to cut some 500 jobs by the end of the year as it prepares for the ban on popular flavors.\n\nWrite to Nat Ives at nat.ives@wsj.com", "description": "Juul Labs\u2019s first CMO is leaving the embattled e-cigarette maker, a spokesman said.", "authors": ["Nat Ives", "Nat.Ives Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-121644/social", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
