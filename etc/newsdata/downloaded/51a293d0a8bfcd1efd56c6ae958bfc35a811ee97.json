REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo\n\nMany fashion players are trying to bolster their environmental credentials as the sector comes under attack for fuelling a throwaway culture.\n\n\u201cThe fashion industry is facing sustainability challenges and we know we have been part of the problem. Going forward, our aspiration is to be part of the solution,\u201d said Zalando co-Chief Executive Rubin Ritter.\n\nThe global production of clothes has doubled since 2002, mainly because people only keep garments half as long, Ritter said, noting that the fashion industry accounts for about 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions and transportation for 14%.\n\nRitter admitted that Zalando\u2019s sustainability push could dent profitability as offsetting carbon had a cost, while ending sales of brands which don\u2019t share its values could hit sales, but should be good for business in the long term.\n\n\u201cWe see a clear link between acting sustainably and continued commercial success,\u201d Ritter said. \u201cWe believe that it will be a competitive advantage in the future.\u201d\n\nZalando has seen online searches for \u201csustainable\u201d fashion jump 66% in the last year, with sales of items it flags as sustainable rising tenfold in the last two years to 260 million euros (\u00a3225 million), Ritter said.\n\nZalando wants to generate 20% of gross merchandise value - sales made on its platform by itself or its partners - from more sustainable products by 2023, about 3-4 billion euros.\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of demand for these products,\u201d Ritter said.\n\nZalando said it wanted to be \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d in its own operations and all deliveries and returns as of today, including self-operated properties, parcel transportation and packaging.\n\nIt switched to over 90% renewable energy at its own buildings this year, is piloting using electric vehicles for deliveries and said it would offset remaining carbon emissions that could not be eliminated in its operations.\n\nCarbon offsetting involves helping to fund a cut in emissions elsewhere, such as through preventing deforestation.\n\nZalando pledged to design its packaging to minimize waste and eliminate single-use plastics by 2023, noting that its boxes are already made from recycled materials.\n\nBy the launch of the 2020 spring/summer collection, its ZIGN private label will be repositioned as a \u201csustainable\u201d brand and flagged as such online, aiming to meet international standards for social, environmental and animal welfare practices.", "description": "Zalando , Europe's biggest online-only fashion retailer, announced plans on Wednesday to cut its emissions of carbon dioxide, eliminate single-use plastics in packaging and sell more shoes and garments made in a sustainable way.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446493388&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0QI", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
