Early this month prices broke to the downside breaking the uptrend from January. Prices closed below the relatively flat 200-day moving average line testing the early June price low.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has rolled over and turned down telling us that sellers of DAL have become more aggressive.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is now below the zero line in sell territory.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of DAL, below, we can see that prices are now below the 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line looks to have topped the past three months and the MACD oscillator has turned down to a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of DAL, below, we can see a potential downside price target of $45 being projected.\n\nBottom line strategy: We find a number of bearish clues on our charts, above, so we want to recommend a defensive strategy on DAL. Weakness below $51 is likely to precipitate further declines to the $45 area in the weeks and months ahead. Try to avoid the long lines at the TSA check point by coming early as well as the long side of DAL.", "description": "Let's check our frequent flyer miles and the charts this afternoon....DAL", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Delta Air Lines Is Losing Its Lift So Prepare For Lower Prices", "Let'S Check Our Frequent Flyer Miles", "The Charts This Afternoon.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Eric Jhonsa", "Jim Cramer", "Bob Lang", "Paul Price", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/ae1abdec-18c6-11e9-b220-a56d91e2df7b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
