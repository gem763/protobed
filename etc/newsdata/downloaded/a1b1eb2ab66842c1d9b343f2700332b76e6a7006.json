He shaped the beard like the Nationals\u2019 \u201cW\u201d logo and quickly caught the attention of television cameras and social media.\n\nBrooks said he competes in facial hair competitions across the U.S. and donates his winnings to charities and nonprofit organizations.\n\n\u201cIt's a blast,\u2019 he told WJLA-TV. \u201cSince I figured out how to style my beard I figured I'd represent my hometown sports teams. I have been styling and competing for eight years now and it usually takes anywhere from one to three hours to complete one of these beard designs. I use a ton of hairspray to get these ideas to work out.\u201d\n\nHe said he plans on styling the beard again to replicate the \u201cW\u201d logo.\n\nJUSTIN VERLANDER BECOMES FIRST PITCHER TO LOSE FIRST 5 WORLD SERIES DECISIONS\n\n\u201cThe Curly W photos are from a couple years back when I went to a Nationals versus Colorado Rockies game in Denver,\u201d Brooks told the station. \u201cI've changed the beard up a bit but I am going to style it into a W again pretty soon to support this historic moment in D.C. sports history... I like to make people smile and by doing something different like this and I hope to bring some good mojo to this incredible team!\u201d\n\nBrooks has been seen in several photos using his beard to support all of D.C.'s pro sports teams.\n\nThe Nationals are up 2-0 in the series against the Houston Astros. Game 3 is set for Friday night.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nA baseball team from Washington hasn\u2019t won the World Series since the Washington Senators in 1924 against the New York Giants.", "description": "A Washington Nationals fan with one of the wackiest beards anyone has ever seen hopes that is epic beard will bring D.C. its first World Series championship since the 1920s.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
