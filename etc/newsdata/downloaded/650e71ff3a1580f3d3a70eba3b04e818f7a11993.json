This map shows which trains serve which lines and where the Rugby World Cup stadiums are in relation to them. Note that some lines share the same track. The map shows the locations of the stadiums and not the precise stadium name\n\nHokkaido/Tohoku Line \u2013 Series H5 (Hokkaido Railway Co), E5 (East Japan Railway Co)\n\nThe H5 bullet train (pictured) is the joint fastest on the network, with a maximum operating speed of 199mph\n\nIf you want to see the landscape in Japan rushing past at maximum speed, then hop on the Hokkaido or Tohoku Lines, because the H5 and E5 bullet trains operating on them are the joint fastest on the network.\n\nThey reach speeds of up to 199mph on the Tohoku Line. (Click here to see one passing at speed through a station.)\n\nThe two lines share the same track until Shin-Aomori at the top of the mainland, then the Hokkaido Line services carry on and zip through one of the world\u2019s longest undersea tunnels, the Seikan Tunnel, which runs for 53.85km (33.4 miles) \u2013 that\u2019s 3.4km longer than the Channel Tunnel.\n\nThe Hokkaido Line will connect directly with Hokkaido\u2019s capital, Sapporo, by 2030.\n\nEast Japan Railway is currently testing the newest Shinkansen, the Alfa-X, which it hopes to operate on the new line at speeds of up to 224mph/360kph, which would be the fastest train in service in Japan.\n\nCapacity: 731.\n\nTop speed: 199mph/320kph.\n\nStadiums served: Kamaishi (Tohoku Line) and Sapporo Dome (Hokkaido Line, then transfer to the Hokuto limited express to Sapporo).\n\nNearest bullet train stations: Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto (Sapporo Dome) and Morioka (Kamaishi).\n\nAkita Line - Series E6, East Japan Railway Co\n\nThe E6 Series runs to Akita, which is a mini-shinkansen line with a top speed of just 80mph. Though the train travels at 199mph before it branches off\n\nThe Akita Line is a spur known as a \u2018mini-shinkansen\u2019 \u2013 a bullet train branch line - that runs off the Tohoku Line and is operated by the blindingly quick E6 Series.\n\nHowever, once it branches off west to Akita the maximum line speed drops from 199mph to 80mph.\n\nCapacity: 336.\n\nTop speed: 199mph/320kph.\n\nStadiums served: None.\n\nJoetsu Line \u2013 Series E7 and E4, East Japan Railway Company\n\nThe E4 Series (pictured) is unique in the Japanese fleet because it\u2019s a double-decker\n\nThe E7 and E4 Series bullet trains are no slouches, but are the slowest in the fleet with maximum service speeds of 160mph and 150mph respectively.\n\nHowever, the E4 Series is unique in the Japanese fleet because it\u2019s a double-decker.\n\nIt operates as an eight-car set that can be joined together to provide a one-train capacity of 1,634 seated passengers.\n\nCapacity: 934 (E7), 1,634 (E4).\n\nTop speed: 161mph/260kph (E7) and 150mph/241kph (E4).\n\nStadiums served: Kumagaya and Tokyo.\n\nNearest bullet train stations: Kumagaya and Tokyo.\n\nHokuriku Line \u2013 Series E7 (East Japan Railway Company), Series W7 (West Japan Railway Co)\n\nThe E7 Series is a relative bullet train slow-coach, with a top operating speed of 'only' 161mph\n\nThe E7 Series also serves the Hokuriku Line, which ends in Kanazawa, but will continue to Tsuruga by 2022.\n\nThe Line opened in 1997 just in time for the Winter Olympics in Nagano, one of the stops along the way.\n\nCapacity: 934.\n\nTop speed: 161mph/260kph.\n\nStadiums served: None.\n\nTokaido/Sanyo Line \u2013 Series N700A, Central Japan Railway Co and West Japan Railway Co\n\nAn N700A bullet train passes in front of the mighty Mt Fuji, which comes into view 44 minutes after departure from Tokyo\n\nThe trains on these two lines are among the most-photographed in Japan \u2013 because they pass Mount Fuji as they hurtle westwards.\n\nFor views of the 12,400ft volcano, which is around 62 miles from Tokyo, sit on the right-hand side travelling westwards, and obviously the left-hand side coming back. It\u2019ll come into view 44 minutes after leaving Tokyo.\n\nThe \u2018A\u2019 in the series name stands for \u2018advanced\u2019.\n\nBoth the N700 and N700A have a one-degree tilt capability, which permits greater speed around curves. But the N700A can accelerate faster.\n\nHowever many of the older sets have now been retrofitted with \u2018A\u2019-grade technology.\n\nCapacity: 1,323.\n\nTop speed: 186mph/300kph (Sanyo Line) and 177mph/285kph (Tokaido Line).\n\nStadiums served: Tokyo, Yokohama, Fukuroi's Ecopa Stadium, City of Toyota (Tokaido Line); Kobe, Fukuoka, Oita (Sanyo Line).

These are operated by the West Japan Railway Co and go to Kyushu island\n\nThe N700 plies its trade all the way to the island of Kyushu via the Sanyo and Kyushu lines.\n\nThe Sanyo Line, which ends at Hakata station in Fukuoka on the island, was the second to be built and opened in 1975.\n\nThe Kyushu Line extension opened in 2004 \u2013 and was finished in March 2011.\n\nThe N700-8000 Series bullet train is run by the Kyushu Railway Company to Kagoshima-Ch\u016b\u014d - the southern terminus on the Kyushu Line and for now the southernmost stop on the network - and has the same external livery as the N700-7000. The line is currently being extended to Nagasaki, with services due to start running in 2022.\n\nCapacity: 546.\n\nTop speed: 186mph/300kph (Sanyo Line), 161mph/260kph (Kyushu Line).\n\nStadiums served: Kobe, Fukuoka, Oita and Hanazono (Sanyo Line); Kumamoto (Kyushu Line).\n\nNearest bullet train stations: Shin-Kobe (Kobe), Hakata (Fukuoka), Kokura (Oita), Kumamoto (for Kumamoto stadium) and Shin-Osaka (Hanazono).\n\nKyushu Line \u2013 Series 800, Kyushu Railway Co\n\nThe 800 Series spends a lot of its time in tunnels on the Kyushu Line - but it has a homely interior, with wooden seats and floors\n\nThe 800 Series began operating in 2004.\n\nIts maximum operating speed is 161mph, but it\u2019s designed to reach 177mph.\n\nLarge portions of the Kyushu Line are in tunnels, so the designers of the Series 800 made the interior as pleasant as possible, with wooden seats and floors for a more homely vibe.\n\nCapacity: 384.\n\nTop speed: 161mph/260kph.\n\nStadiums served: Kumamoto.\n\nNearest bullet train stations: Kumamoto (for Kumamoto stadium).\n\nYamagata Shinkansen - E3-1000 Series and E3-2000 Series, East Japan Railway Company\n\nThe E3 Series is a slightly narrower bullet train and serves the Yamagata Line at speeds of up to 171mph\n\nThis is another mini-shinkansen line, like the Akita Line, and is operated by the slightly narrower E3 Series.\n\nThese can hit 171mph, but once they branch off on the line to terminus station Shinjo, the limit is 80mph.\n\nCapacity: 394.\n\nTop speed: 171mph/275kph.\n\nStadiums served: None.", "description": "Rugby fans visiting Japan for the World Cup are in for a treat if they use the country's bullet trains to reach the stadiums.
