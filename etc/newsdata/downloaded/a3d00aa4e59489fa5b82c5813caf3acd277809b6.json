It actually defends the police against the authoritative findings of Henriques because they wanted to boost public confidence in themselves,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Home Secretary should remove the IOPC director general and the IOPC must be abolished and replaced by experts who are genuinely qualified to assess and to criticise police failings. We now know the police watchdog is blind,\u201d he added.\n\nHis lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson QC, said: \u201cIt is a fundamental mistake for the IOPC to think that police are justified in abusing their powers in order to maintain public confidence in themselves \u2013 that is an improper motive and it is outrageous that the IOPC should think it is a valid excuse for accusing innocent men of heinous crimes or misleading a judge to obtain a search warrant for their homes.\u201d\n\nWriting in the Daily Mail, Sir Richard expressed concern over the watchdog\u2019s \u201clack of knowledge of criminal procedure\u201d and called on Home Secretary Priti Patel to take action.\n\nHe said the IOPC investigation was \u201cflawed\u201d, that \u201cno effective interrogations\u201d took place and that he found it \u201cdifficult to conceive that no misconduct or criminality was involved by at least one officer\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhilst all five, absent any proper investigation, must be presumed innocent, the responsibility of the IOPC was to carry out a high-quality investigation in a timely manner,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThe delay in reaching their findings of almost three years is gross and inexcusable, and goes some way to inhibiting any further investigation.\n\n\u201cThe investigative process itself was minimal, unprofessional and the decision-making was flawed.\u201d\n\nSir Richard said the two most senior officers among the five investigated \u2013 Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse and Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald \u2013 had not been asked \u201ca single question in interview \u2026 written answers having been accepted without questioning\u201d.\n\nHe concluded: \u201cMaintenance of law and order depends upon the effective oversight of those invested with power. Who guards the guards themselves? A malfunctioning police force has not received the necessary oversight.\u201d\n\nDaniel Janner QC, whose late father Lord Janner was also accused by Beech, said the IOPC had \u201coverlooked clear evidence of serious failings and negligence\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe IOPC gives the impression of working hand in glove with the police. Confidence in our police needs to be restored.\n\n\u201cI am calling for a judge-led independent inquiry into Operation Midland and how patently false allegations are handled by the police.\u201d\n\nThe IOPC said: \u201cThis was a thorough and detailed investigation, reviewing over 1,800 documents, 300 statements gathering 14 independent witness accounts and gaining accounts to three officers who were under investigation. This was not a cursory exercise.\n\n\u201cAs Sir Richard writes \u2018no subject should be tried without proper investigation\u2019. And, as he acknowledges in his own review, the IOPC is the right and correct authority to do this. Our investigation was both independent and impartial.\n\n\u201cTo suggest there is no accountability is also wrong. Our report \u2013 due to be published (on Monday) \u2013 contains 16 learning recommendations that advocate systemic change so this never happens again.\u201d", "description": "Harvey Proctor has criticised the Independent Office for Police Conduct\u00b4s report.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/10/wire-19387698-1570440266-941_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
