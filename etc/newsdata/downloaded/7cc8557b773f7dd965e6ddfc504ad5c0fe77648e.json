You can reserve a unit online, though you\u2019ll need to drive in to pick it up.\n\nApple\u2019s 2018 MacBook Air is cheaper than ever at Micro Center (via Slickdeals) if you\u2019re willing to pick it up in-store. Normally $1,199, it\u2019s now $799 for the base model, which has an 8th Gen Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, and 128GB of storage. If you want to double the storage (but sadly not double the RAM) that model now costs $999.\n\nThe latest MacBook Air revision for 2019 improves on last year\u2019s version in subtle ways, according to our review. This year\u2019s model has a True Tone display, allowing the screen to automatically adjust the color temperature based on the ambient lighting, and model starts at $1,099, which is $100 cheaper than last year\u2019s base model sold for. If those differences don\u2019t sell you, Micro Center\u2019s deal is probably worth taking up.\n\nThe Google Pixel 3A XL (64GB) is $379 today only at Best Buy if you activate it with Verizon, AT&T, or Sprint. This is $100 off of its usual price, and Best Buy is also including a $100 gift card with purchase (but only for the 3A XL model). The smaller Pixel 3A is also $100 off with activation, bringing the cost down to $299.\n\nIf you don\u2019t intend to activate the phone, or would prefer to buy it unlocked, you\u2019ll still receive the $100 Best Buy gift card when you buy the Pixel 3A XL at full price. This is the same promotion that Amazon ran during Prime Day 2019, but it works out to be considerably cheaper if you happen to be activating the Pixel 3A XL on a carrier.\n\nThe Pixel 3 is the better phone if you need more power, as well as features like waterproofing, and wireless charging. However at around half of its cost, the Pixel 3A XL (as well as the smaller 3A) is just as capable when it comes to taking excellent photos \u2014 plus, it has a headphone jack.\n\nDieter Bohn stands by the Pixel 3A XL in The Verge\u2019s review, saying \u201cIn 15 years of reviewing phones, I am not sure if I\u2019ve ever been able to write the following sentence: a $400 phone has a camera that\u2019s among the best you can get on any smartphone.\u201d", "description": "If you\u2019re not sold on the 2019 MacBook Air, last year\u2019s version is going for its cheapest price yet at Micro Center. It\u2019s $400 off of its regular price for the 128GB model. Best Buy is also discounting Pixel 3A XL phones if you activate them.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PUduhQ_6DNWR55RQh9AVmetARPc=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13390439/vpavic_181104_3068_0157.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-19"}
