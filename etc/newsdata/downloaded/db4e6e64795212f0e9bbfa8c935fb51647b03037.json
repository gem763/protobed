After enough dislikes, it is removed. This directly translates into sales!!\"\n\nThe FTC charged the company and Ms Riley with two violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act.\n\n'Wrong message'\n\nA commission reached a proposed settlement that prohibits Sunday Riley and Ms Riley from posting fake reviews in the future.\n\nHowever, two FTC commissioners who oversaw the case voted against the proposed settlement, and said that by not penalising Sunday Riley or seeking financial redress \"this action does little to address the epidemic of fake reviews online\".\n\nIn a joint statement, Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter of the FTC, said: \"This settlement sends the wrong message to the marketplace.\n\n\"Dishonest firms may come to conclude that posting fake reviews is a viable strategy, given the proposed outcome here. Honest firms, who are the biggest victims of this fraud, may be wondering if they are losing out by following the law. Consumers may come to lack confidence that reviews are truthful.\"\n\nThe FTC said it will accept comments from the public for 30 days before finalising the proposed settlement with Sunday Riley.", "description": "Staff at Sunday Riley were found to have posted fake positive reviews on beauty giant Sephora's website.", "authors": ["Dearbail Jordan", "Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/18A8/production/_109321360_sundayriely.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
