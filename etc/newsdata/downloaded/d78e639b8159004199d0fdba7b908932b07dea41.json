'It doesn't feel greasy, it feels really soft and supple.'\n\nThe product, which was launched on Monday - just days after the brand celebrated its fifth birthday - contains a blend of four nourishing oils: jojoba, evening promise, rosehip and grape seed, which all help to create that dewy look, while also moisturizing the skin.\n\nA further boost of hydration comes in the form of sugarcane squalane, while evodia rutaecarpa extract helps to brighten the skin, leaving you with that post-facial glow that lasts all day long.\n\nPicture perfect: Many YouTubers and Instagram stars, including Sincerely, Sarah C, noted that the serum offers a model-worthy glow that is normally only seen in skincare campaigns\n\nGet the glow: YouTuber Serein Wu said of the product that it 'makes your skin look really hydrated and dewy and clear'\n\nHigh praise: 'I am so glowy and super dewy,' Lizbeth Hernandez exclaimed after applying the oil-serum hybrid for the first time\n\nWhich is exactly what its creators intended when formulating Futuredew, with Glossier founder Emily Weiss revealing to Popsugar: 'You know when you get a facial or when you put [your skin care] on in the morning?\n\n'You look amazing if you've done your zillion steps, but by noon, [you may not] look glowy anymore... This is still dewy and glowy for 12 hours.'\n\nA brand spokesperson echoed that sentiment, saying in a statement: 'You know that dewy sheen you get after you put on all your serums and moisturizers? The one that looks so good but evaporates as soon as you leave the bathroom? We created Futuredew to bottle that effect and make it last.\n\n'Futuredew is an oil-serum hybrid packed with nourishing oils (that don\u2019t feel greasy) and brightening plant-based extracts to deliver an instant and lasting glow. The lightweight formula is designed to be used as the final step in your skincare routine for that gleamy, refreshed look that Glossier is known for.'\n\nDespite being promoted as skincare however, the product really straddles the line between traditional skincare and makeup, acting more as a hybrid between the two, both in terms of the texture of the formula, and its suggested use.\n\nWhile traditional serums tend to be much more thin in terms of the formula, Futuredew has a thicker, almost tacky feel to it before it's applied into the skin and any trace of stickiness disappears.\n\nIt is also recommended for use both as the final step in your skincare routine - with the brand suggesting that it is applied even after SPF - but can then be applied on top of makeup as a highlighter, which certainly helps to solidify its position at the makeup end of the skincare spectrum.\n\nBut while the product certainly doesn't fit into a traditional skincare category, that hasn't stopped fans from waxing lyrical about its dew-giving abilities.", "description": "Glossier launched its new Futuredew\u00a0oil-serum hybrid on Monday.
