A week later, however, Mr. Parker announced that Nike was shutting down the Oregon Project and cutting official ties with Mr. Salazar, though it said it would still finance his appeal.\n\nShalane Flanagan , a Nike-sponsored runner who this week joined the coaching staff of another elite training group at Nike, said she was not surprised by the activities cited in the agency report on Mr. Salazar but that she did not realize Mr. Parker had been aware of what was going on.\n\n\u201cThere must be some deeper layers to this that are over my head,\u201d Ms. Flanagan said of Mr. Parker\u2019s leaving as chief executive.\n\nSeveral current and former female Nike-sponsored runners came forward this year to say they had been forced to decide whether to risk financial penalties from the company if they became pregnant. Nike responded by changing its policy, waiving performance-pay reductions for pregnant athletes.\n\nIn early 2018, a number of women inside the organization described the environment at Nike as a toxic boy\u2019s club. They said their careers had been blunted, they felt marginalized in meetings, and they had endured other forms of sexual harassment and gender discrimination.\n\nAs a result, Nike and Mr. Parker removed more than a dozen executives, both male and female. Those who left the company included Trevor Edwards , the president of the Nike brand who was widely seen at the time as a candidate to replace Mr. Parker.\n\nKeJuan Wilkins , a spokesman for Nike, said Mr. Parker\u2019s decision to step aside now was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d a result of the Oregon Project controversy or any other issue. Rather, he said, it was part of a plan with the board that has been in the works for months to name a successor.", "description": "Mr. Parker, who was involved in multiple controversies in recent years, will become executive chairman of the sportswear company.", "authors": ["Julie Creswell", "Matthew Futterman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/business/22nike1/merlin_162026688_34762508-b696-4f87-a579-b700f934d1bc-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
