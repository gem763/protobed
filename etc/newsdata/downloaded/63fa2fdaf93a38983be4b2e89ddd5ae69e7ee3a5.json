Only a week ago, there were 215 suspected cases in 25 states.\n\nDeaths have been reported in Indiana, Illinois and Oregon. A fourth fatality was announced Friday by the Minnesota Department of Health. The department said the person was over 65 and died after being hospitalized for a lung injury incurred after vaping an illicit product containing THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.\n\nNew York state officials have suggested the culprit may be \u201cvery high\u201d levels of vitamin E found in some vape cartridges containing cannabis.\n\nBut while a majority of people who\u2019ve gotten sick have vaped from cartridges containing cannabis products, some have only been vaping nicotine, according to the CDC.\n\n\u201cWhile the investigation is ongoing, the CDC has advised that individuals consider not using e-cigarettes, because as of now, this is the primary means of preventing lung disease,\u201d Dr. Dana Meaney-Delman, who is investigating the matter for the CDC, told reporters on a conference call Friday.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to finding out what is making people sick,\u201d said Robert Redfield, director of the CDC. \u201cAll available information is being carefully analyzed, and these initial findings are helping us narrow the focus of our investigation.\u201d\n\nFor now, the whole thing remains pretty mysterious, wrote Christiani.\n\n\u201cUntil the investigation into the cause of this epidemic of vaping-induced respiratory injury is complete, no conclusions can be drawn as to which compound or compounds are the causes of injury,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPhysicians should discourage their patients from vaping.\u201d\n\nCover: A man breathes vape from an e-cigarette at a vape shop in London, Friday, Aug. 17, 2018.(AP Photo/Frank Augstein)", "description": "\u201cThere is clearly an epidemic that begs for an urgent response.\u201d", "authors": ["Gavin Butler", "Caleb Quinley", "Sarah Ngu"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d72a1f2666dcf000ea3d6d9/lede/1567793721377-AP_18229364638343.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8009xh;0xw,0.125xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
