What went wrong? | Giles Tremlett Read more\n\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n, a co-founder of Podemos, which he left in January after disagreements with its leader, Pablo Iglesias, said he was launching the party, M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds (More Country), because he wanted to help form a government and encourage disillusioned leftwing voters to turn up at the polling stations.\n\n\u201cI understand the widespread anger of the Spanish people with the current leaders and with the political stalemate,\u201d he said in front of a crowd cheering \u201cpresident\u201d.\n\nErrej\u00f3n\u2019s party could further fragment the vote and either help the right get a majority or make it harder for any bloc to do so. There was already no guarantee the new election would make it any easier to strike a deal to form a government, and there will now be three main parties on the left and the right, after the far-right Vox made a breakthrough in the April election.\n\n\u201cThis makes it even more difficult to foresee how the new parliament will look, and what type of feasible majorities will emerge,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez-Albertos, a political scientist at Spanish National Research Council.\n\nPodemos was the dazzling new force in Spanish politics. What went wrong? | Giles Tremlett Read more\n\nErrej\u00f3n, 35, who is considered more moderate than Iglesias and was his second in command in Podemos, had in 2016 backed an agreement with the Socialists that Iglesias eventually rejected. In a recent interview, Errej\u00f3n said he was in favour of a government deal with S\u00e1nchez.\n\nIn his first speech as a candidate, Errej\u00f3n said he wanted to achieve an agreement among leftwing forces to form a government.\n\nS\u00e1nchez is currently ahead in opinion polls, but Errej\u00f3n and Iglesias are on bad terms, making a three-way government deal potentially difficult.\n\nBased on how a previous, regional party he set up earlier this year did in local elections in May, Errej\u00f3n could hope to get as many as five seats in the national parliament in the Madrid region alone.\n\nSome analysts said the new party could convince leftwing voters put off by the lack of a deal between the Socialists and Podemos to turn up at polling stations.\n\n\u201cThe leftwing electorate is going to be motivated. Some to defend Iglesias, others to punish him,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez-Albertos said.", "description": "Podemos co-founder \u00cd\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n says he hopes to attract disillusioned leftwing voters", "authors": ["Reuters In Madrid"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42a40c3299fe0eccef7ed2d9acc20301e14f333c/0_126_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=05e547bf614292530becf904ee990d46", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
