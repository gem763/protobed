That question generates new headlines every time the president faces a new scandal. Trump has been married three times, after all. He doesn\u2019t know anything about the Bible. 21 women have accused him of sexual assault. But white evangelicals hold fast to him through it all. If you\u2019re befuddled by all that Christian support for a seemingly unchristian man, Netflix\u2019s new docuseries The Family should resolve your confusion.\n\nThe series, which chronicles the political ambitions of a secretive network of conservative Christians, is the latest project from The Overnighters filmmaker Jesse Moss. With The Family, Moss has produced original reporting that deserves urgent attention. The series uncovers the work of Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt, who went to Romania to campaign against same-sex marriage, and of Maria Butina, who exploited the National Prayer Breakfast as part of her attempt to influence American politics. It also draws from the earlier reporting of journalist Jeff Sharlet; the first episode dramatizes Sharlet\u2019s infiltration of Ivanwald, an Arlington, Virginia home for young men run by Family associates. Sharlet would later publish two books about the Family, known also as the Fellowship, and its associates: The Family, in 2008, and C Street, in 2010.\n\nFounded by Abraham Vereide as an outreach to elites, and led by Doug Coe for decades until his death in 2017, the Family reveres power and thrives in secrecy. It has no problem, Moss tells us, with bad men. Before Vereide launched the National Prayer Breakfast, he sought out Nazi war criminals on orders from the U.S. State Department \u2014 and though he didn\u2019t hold Nazi beliefs, Sharlet reports that Vereide openly admired their anti-democratic discipline. In the decades since, the Family\u2019s associates have formed working relationships with some of the world\u2019s bloodiest dictators. At least one associate \u2014 former Michigan representative Mark Siljander \u2014 did time in prison in connection to these overseas activities. And Trump is just the strong man they\u2019ve waited to serve. As Sharlet recalls in the series, Coe had no time for sheep and wished instead to reach the wolf. Bring in the \u201cWolf King,\u201d as Coe called this strong man, and you have a figure who could finally create a God-led government.\n\nMost evangelicals have nothing to do with the Family. Even so, its theology is relatively mainstream, as I\u2019ve discovered not only through covering the Christian right, but through my own upbringing and education in the evangelical world. The idea that God ordains a person\u2019s place in the world is not unique to Vereide or his successor, and it has pernicious side effects. If God picks our leaders, the thinking goes, we should obey them \u2014 no matter how violent their personal lives or how vicious their political views. If you worship power, the pursuit of it becomes a sacrament. The Trump presidency is not blasphemy, then, but God\u2019s will.\n\nWhy make this series now, years after Jeff published The Family and C Street?\n\nJesse Moss: I had not read Jeff\u2019s book when it came out. I wasn\u2019t even aware of the Fellowship. The big question I had was, first of all, How did I miss this? But then, Is this organization still relevant? Is this real? A question I thought this series might help to answer was the relationship between the Christian right and Donald Trump. I feel fortunate that, in the course of making the series, the question of relevance was answered by two things. One was Maria Butina [and] the Russian-spy story exploding at the National Prayer Breakfast. The second was digging into the story of Robert Aderholt in Romania.\n\nWhen Trump was running for office and it became quite clear that white evangelicals did not have a problem with his personal life or with the seeming superficiality of his faith, I think some of my peers in the press thought that it was hypocritical for evangelicals to support him. But what I get from your reporting, Jeff, and from the documentary, Jesse, is that hypocrisy is perhaps not the best way to understand this support. Is it actually proof of a logically consistent, underlying ideology?\n\nJeff Sharlet: One of the most frustrating things to me about American political life and American media is the insistence on hypocrisy as the frame through which we understand the Christian right. There\u2019s a na\u00efvet\u00e9 about that \u2014 for secular liberals to imagine, as if Christian conservatives have never heard of this thing called politics, and as if they too don\u2019t say, \u201cI have these ends, what are the means I need to achieve them?\u201d As if they don\u2019t have an idea, which is especially strong in the Fellowship, that God does what he wants. That God uses tools.\n\nWe see now the rise of far-right authoritarian governments worldwide. The Family and Fellowship associates have been really active in a lot of these countries. Should we assign them any credit for that phenomenon?\n\nSharlet: I think of the Ugandan dictator Yoweri Museveni and Bob Hunter, who is sort of [The Family\u2019s] Ugandan liaison. You go back into the records \u2014 this is stuff that we couldn\u2019t get into the series \u2014 and you see that, actually, Hunter was traveling in conversation with the Reagan government. They were looking to recruit a foreign leader. They wanted an anti-communist leader. The Family became the conduit through which they did that work. It wasn\u2019t that the Reagan administration was going to support democracy in Uganda and the Family convinced them otherwise. The Family made it possible in that case, as it did with Senator Chuck Grassley in Somalia.\n\nMoss: In the case of Butina, they set up a framework in which someone who maybe didn\u2019t have Jesus in her heart could exploit the National Prayer Breakfast. Or maybe that is, in fact, the purpose of the framework to begin with. It\u2019s what Jeff talks about: Is it na\u00efvet\u00e9 or is it cynicism? It\u2019s the triumph of the Fellowship that it\u2019s a combination of the two. We see that also embodied in someone like Mark Siljander, and Robert Aderholt\u2019s work in Romania to campaign against same-sex marriage. There\u2019s a whole lot happening in Central Europe around homosexuality now, and we didn\u2019t trace all of those threads back to the Fellowship. But it\u2019s bigger than the Fellowship. It\u2019s a kind of alliance of interests. I think that those authoritarian relationships are a threat to our democracy, and it\u2019s not theoretical.\n\nEven if someone has only watched the series and hasn\u2019t read Jeff\u2019s books, it\u2019s hard to avoid that we\u2019re talking about a very male organization. How do they perceive masculinity, how does it feature in their theology, and how does it influence their relationship to power?\n\nSharlet: You\u2019re probably familiar with the tradition of muscular Christianity in American Christianity. We see this idea that if Jesus was alive today, he\u2019d be a Navy SEAL. Certainly, the Family doesn\u2019t invent this kind of supermacho theology. They embrace the idea of male headship that one sees in a lot of conservative evangelical settings, but they put it to political uses. So, they will work with powerful women \u2014 there\u2019s no line they won\u2019t cross in order to work with power and they believe that they\u2019re theologically called to do so \u2014 but it\u2019s on a male-leadership model.\n\nMoss: In adapting that chapter of Jeff\u2019s book that deals with his experience at Ivanwald, I really had to tone down the homoerotic subtext. Even though it\u2019s very present in Jeff\u2019s description, I felt like that would tip the series too far into a space that would detract from the deeper reporting. I\u2019ll also say that when I ended up at this small [men\u2019s] prayer group in Portland, it helped me understand on a non-intellectual level the attraction of a movement of men where I might work out my anxieties around sexuality or social standing or religion. It was helpful to see why you might find refuge in this group and in this movement.\n\nSharlet: Jesse made the right choice in not focusing on the homoeroticism of it, but it\u2019s pretty pervasive, right down to former Senator Sam Brownback, who\u2019s now Trump\u2019s ambassador for international religious freedom, telling me that his prayer cell would discuss their sexual feelings. A bunch of congressmen getting together to talk about how they struggle with masturbation, you can say that\u2019s silly and goofy and innocuous. I would argue that is in keeping with that mega-Christian right best seller, Every Man\u2019s Battle \u2014 the battle is supposedly with masturbation. There\u2019s another best seller, Every Woman\u2019s Battle, and every woman\u2019s battle is basically to keep her man sexually satisfied. There\u2019s a real stark divide there. Those things play out in the world and that\u2019s why it matters.\n\nMoss: We did hear from [former Tennessee representative] Zach Wamp about how he believes the organization is committed to a greater degree of transparency, to reflect the diversity of our modern moment in its own leadership. Only time will tell whether that commitment is real.\n\nSharlet: I would argue that time has told, because they said all those same things back in 2010 when Rachel Maddow and I forced them out into the open around the Uganda thing. We actually arranged for Bob Hunter, who you see in the series, to go on the Maddow Show and he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been too secretive and want to change that.\u201d And they didn\u2019t. As for diversity, there\u2019s this secular liberal fantasy that the Christian right has always been like the KKK. The reality is that it\u2019s not, it\u2019s always been much more racially diverse \u2014 certainly internationally \u2014 but there\u2019s also tiers of citizenship. The Family decided in the \u201970s that they were going to make their own Black Panthers. And they did it. They called them the Black Buffers. All white-led, but you wouldn\u2019t see the white men. They bought the matching dashikis. They were supposed to infiltrate Black Power organizations and report back. And the leadership was based on the very explicit premise that the biggest problem facing blacks in America is the black man himself. And the answer to racism is not to be found in legislation or government, but in the submission of the black man to God. That\u2019s the diversity that they\u2019re offering.\n\nTrump really does embody so much about the Family. He\u2019s got this swaggering masculinity. He\u2019s the Ur-capitalist. But I wonder if the Family sees Trump as a way to break things down, to the point where a more traditional politician like Josh Hawley of Missouri, or Tom Cotton of Arkansas \u2014\n\nSharlet: Or Mike Pence.\n\n\u2014 or Pence. Someone who will reorder society in the way that the Family wants. Is that conspiratorial on my part, or is that their thinking?\n\nSharlet: That\u2019s certainly not conspiratorial. That\u2019s very explicit in their rhetoric. Trump is not the endgame, but he is, I think, a huge pivot. It\u2019s a very, very long game. And Sarah, you may be one of the few reporters that we\u2019re talking to who knows the difference between pre-milliennialism and post-millennialism.\n\nThat\u2019s probably true.\n\nSharlet: They\u2019re post-millennials. Certainly there are pre-millennials involved, but the Family is about building the 1,000-year kingdom of God on Earth. That\u2019s the theology.\n\nMoss: I think it\u2019s also why it was really important to look back at the history of the movement \u2014 their birth in the 1930s, and their anti-labor activism, and the close relationship with fascism. They might say today that it\u2019s ancient history, but that\u2019s the DNA of the organization, of its philosophy and theology. It\u2019s really important to understand. It may seem inflammatory to talk about the work that Abraham Vereide did in postwar Germany, but this is the organization\u2019s history. This is not something we\u2019re speculating about.\n\nSharlet: When I wrote The Family, I had a chapter called \u201cThe F Word.\u201d The F-word was fascism. I said they are not fascist. I said there\u2019s more than one kind of authoritarianism under the sun. I said fascism is impossible in America and American fundamentalism will prevent it. And I think I was wrong. We\u2019re not there yet, but we see the potential. We see just how quickly the theology of the Wolf King can lead us down that road.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and condensed for length.", "description": "A conversation with director Jesse Moss and journalist Jeff Sharlet about the Netflix docuseries The Family, which investigates the purpose and influence of a clandestine, decades-old evangelical Christian organization known as The Family.", "authors": ["Sarah Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/29/29-the-family.w1200.h630.jpg"}
