Responding to that proposal, Potter said:\n\n\u201cI see no argument that makes sense to have something that complicated out there when you have large, liquid capital markets in the U.S.\"\n\nPotter further said that Carney failed to take into account how the U.S. dollar\u2019s status has benefited other countries. \u201cNot having one currency that you can basically price things and have a deep market in, that makes life much harder for the global economy,\" Potter concluded.", "description": "Simon Potter, the former executive vice-president and head of the markets group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is the latest veteran to express concerns over Facebook\u2019s Libra-like cryptocurrencies.The post Ex-Fed official says central banks should be \u2018very concerned\u2019 about Libra-like cryptocurrencies", "authors": ["Yogita Khatri"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IXp70z75T4mXKlIjZUW7NA--~B/aD00NTA7dz02NzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_block_83/355ce9208a855283f16db6a154546d42", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
