As tensions rose in her nightmare, Evans claims that dream-Howell told her that she needed to swallow her engagement ring to protect it from the villains.\n\n\"I popped that sucker off, put it in my mouth and swallowed it with a glass of water riiiight about the time I realized what I was doing,\" Evans wrote on Facebook. \"I assumed this too was a dream, because WHO ACTUALLY SWALLOWS THEIR ENGAGEMENT RING, so I went back to sleep.\"\n\nExcept, when she woke up on Wednesday morning, she realized her left ring finger was bare \u2014 and she knew exactly where her ring had ended up.\n\nEvans woke her soon-to-be husband and explained that she had swallowed her ring in her sleep. While doubtful at first, the couple found the situation so funny they ended up crying from laughter. Eventually, after Googling \"do other adults swallow rings,\" they decided a trip to urgent care was necessary.\n\nAfter explaining her plight to the nurses and doctors, in between bursts of laughter, an X-Ray confirmed that Evans had swallowed her custom-made engagement ring.\n\nA gastroenterologist was consulted, and ultimately it was decided that Evans should not let nature run its course and that an upper endoscopy should be performed.\n\nDespite needing the procedure, which would involve anesthesia, Evans was thankful.\n\n\"I was really happy because I don't know if I can look at it and appreciate it in the same way if I had to search for it,\" Evans joked to ABC10.\n\nEvans shared that she began to experience discomfort from the ring, and nerves set in after she had to sign a \"release form just in case you die,\" according to her Facebook post.\n\n\"I cried a lot because I would be SO MAD if I died,\" she wrote. \"I waited a long time for that damn engagement ring and I WILL marry Bobby Howell.\"\n\nDoctors successfully retrieved Evans' ring, but gave it to Howell for safekeeping. Howell waited a day before entrusting Evans with the ring again.\n\nEvans, who now removes her ring before going to sleep, will marry Howell in her home state, Texas, next May.\n\nShe did not immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A woman unintentionally swallowed her engagement ring while dreaming she was keeping it away from villains \u2014 and ultimately required surgery to remove it.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kT3pqU7s.Fgy4duaqmnEQg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.cbsphiladelphia.com/7aa83bf88f069eb8549d59f11b2d9bfa", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
