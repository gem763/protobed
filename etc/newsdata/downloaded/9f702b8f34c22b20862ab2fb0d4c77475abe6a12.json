England were half decent, Pavarotti made everyone fall in love with opera, Roger Milla danced around the corner flag, Paul Gascoigne cried and \u2013 to paraphrase Gary Lineker\u2019s famous quip \u2013 at the end of it all the Germans won. But apparently this rottweiler wasn\u2019t so enthused by the whole spectacle when Argentina, featuring the great Maradona, faced Yugoslavia in the quarter-finals. With the dog\u2019s jaws clamped around an Adidas Etrusco Unico football and its handler chuckling to himself, this frame goes to show that sometimes the best sporting images aren\u2019t of the action itself. Incidentally, Argentina won the match on penalties, despite Maradona\u2019s effort being saved.\n\nPhotograph: Mark Leech/Offside\n\nWords: Jonny Weeks\n\nBuy your exclusive print here\n\nPrice\n\n\u00a355 including delivery\n\nPrints\n\nPhotographs are 30x40cm and presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100-plus years.
