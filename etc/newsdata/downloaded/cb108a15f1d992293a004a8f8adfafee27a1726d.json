So he drew a picture of the other side cheating and called it fraud.\n\nHe drew a picture of his inauguration with so many people in it!\n\nThen Donald set off to be president, taking his big, black Sharpie with him. And the moon followed him.\n\nBeing president is hard work, which he did not like. So he drew pictures that made it look as though he was working on the golf course and at the country club.\n\nHe drew a lot of pictures that showed polls going up, up, up!\n\n\n\n(Tom Toles/The Washington Post)\n\nHe drew a picture of himself with all his children. He made everybody slender. He drew his advisers. He made them look competent.\n\nHe drew a picture of the Constitution that said immigrants cannot be citizens.\n\nHe drew a certificate for himself that said he was a genius and another saying he was very healthy.\n\nHe drew a picture of himself giving money to charity and still having more money than anybody ever thought he did.\n\nHe drew a country called Nambia.\n\nHe drew a witch hunt.\n\nHe drew a picture of happy people getting tax cuts and great health care and another picture of the government debt going away.\n\nHe drew a picture of workers with smiley faces in steel mills. He drew a picture of ships going across the ocean to China with lots of coal and soybeans. He drew a picture of Chinese people waving a white flag.\n\nHe drew a picture of the Group of Seven with Russia at the table.\n\nHe drew a picture of Greenland with the American flag on it.\n\nHe wanted to meet with allies, but he did not have any, so he drew some. They looked happy.\n\nHe drew a picture of George Washington\u2019s army fighting at airports!\n\nHe drew Democrats as criminals and reporters as traitors.\n\nHe drew a weather map with a big, frightening storm!\n\n\n\n(Tom Toles/The Washington Post)\n\nBut there was one thing Donald did not know how to draw: He could not make a picture of Mexico paying him for a wall.\n\nSo he drew a picture of the Pentagon paying for the wall by taking money away from 127 projects.\n\nThey took money from schools and day care for children of military families. They took money away from a place for troops to eat. They took away fire stations from people who fly planes. They took money from people hurt by storms in Puerto Rico. They took money that protected Japan and South Korea. They took money that protected Europe from Russia. Many people were sad.\n\nBut, luckily, Donald kept his wits and his black Sharpie. He drew schools for the children and a dining room and fire stations for the troops. He erased Puerto Rico from the map. He drew Kim Jong Un with valentines instead of bombs so he did not frighten Japan and South Korea. He drew fierce dragons and a moat to protect Europe from Russia. He drew a friendly Vladimir Putin who would not frighten them.\n\nAfter all this work, Donald was hungry and tired. He drew himself nine Big Macs, and he ate them all. He made his bed, and he drew Melania in it. She was frowning, so he drew a smile on her face. He got in bed and drew up the covers.\n\nThe black Sharpie dropped on the floor. And Donald dropped off to sleep.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "With apologies to \u201cHarold and the Purple Crayon.\u201d", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics", "September At Pm", "Dana Milbank Is An Op-Ed Columnist.
