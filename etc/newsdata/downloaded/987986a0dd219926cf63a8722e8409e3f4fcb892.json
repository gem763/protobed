REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\n\nWASHINGTON/WEST CALDWELL, New Jersey (Reuters) - Ambriola Co Inc\u2019s mammoth warehouse in West Caldwell, New Jersey, is crammed full of boxes and wheels of harder cheeses such as Parmigiano Reggiano, Pecorino Romano and Grana Padano - and more is coming, lots more.\n\nPhil Marfuggi, president and chief executive officer of Ambriola, a unit of Auricchio SpA, one of Italy\u2019s largest cheese producers, is among the many importers and shop owners across the country who are scrambling to stockpile European cheeses before new U.S. tariffs kick in on Oct. 18 in efforts to shield consumers from price hikes.\n\nThe Trump administration on Wednesday slapped 25% tariffs on cheese and other European Union products ranging from whisky to woolens, in retaliation for EU subsidies on large aircraft. Both sides say they are open to negotiations, but trade experts see little chance of averting the duties - at least in the short run.\n\nImporters began ordering millions of dollars of extra wheels of Parmigiano Reggiano and other harder cheeses after the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office in July added cheese to its list of EU products potentially facing tariffs due to the dispute over aircraft subsidies.\n\n\u201cWhen that list came out, that\u2019s when I ... started bringing in many more containers of cheese of Reggiano, Provolone,\u201d said Marfuggi, who has another 21 shipping containers full of cheese en route to be added to the stockpile in the company\u2019s warehouse in Caldwell, which sits about 15 miles west of Manhattan.\n\nMarfuggi said he ordered an extra $15 million of cheeses that could be stored for over a year to ensure adequate supplies for existing customers and protect pricing through the end of the year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been building up inventory ... because we have a target on our backs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new duties could slash U.S. imports of EU cheeses valued at $1.5 billion a year by 30% and jack up prices across the country, said Marfuggi, who also serves as president of the Cheese Importers Association of America.\n\nSome higher-priced items will simply disappear from stores, he predicted, like Moliterno al Tartufo, an aged Italian cheese with an intense truffle flavor. Even Parmigiano Reggiano could be at risk if prices rose to $30 a pound, he said.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be some items ... that the supermarkets are just not going to handle anymore. It\u2019ll be price prohibitive for that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe tariffs will hit consumer prices and eventually jobs across the United States, said Ralph Hoffman, executive vice president of Schuman Cheese, one of the largest importers of hard Italian cheeses.\n\nOver 20,000 U.S. retail stores ranging from Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) to Wegmans Food Markets sell EU cheeses. These cheeses generate some $3.5 billion of revenue for U.S. companies, supporting some 20,000 jobs, including buyers, deli clerks, truck drivers and warehouse workers, Hoffman said. He noted that the new tariffs come on top of existing duties of around 15%.\n\nSpecialty grocer The Fresh Market expects the tariffs to affect about 35% of the 200 cheeses it carries at its 160 stores.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting to see how the importers are going to pass the cost along,\u201d said Andrew Harvell, who heads the company\u2019s cheese department. \u201cEverything\u2019s still up in the air,\u201d he said, adding that Fresh Market had pre-ordered enough cheese to last through the holiday season, but may need to raise prices soon thereafter.\n\nMike Bowers, the third-generation owner of a specialty cheese shop at Washington\u2019s storied Eastern Market, said he began hoarding extra wheels of hard cheeses - some weighing as much as 80 pounds - in July when USTR first announced it could impose tariffs on cheese and other agricultural goods.\n\nHis glass cheese counters, coolers and large walk-in refrigerator are filled to overflowing, but Bowers said his supplies will not last through the holiday season. He said he will have to pass on the cost of the tariffs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a small guy. I can\u2019t buy a $100 cheese and sell it for $50 and expect to stay in business too long,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have a stockpile of cheese to make sure that I\u2019m able to maintain inventory and maintain sales at my counter,\u201d Bowers said. \u201cAnd then as time goes on, we\u2019ll have to see.\u201d\n\nHe said the quality of U.S. cheeses was improving, providing good alternatives for some popular European cheeses, but he would have to find ways to be more \u201cinnovative\u201d in the future.\n\nHe also has a solid selection on hand of Swiss cheeses that are not subject to EU tariffs, including a Gruyere-style L\u2019Etivaz, made in copper pots according to ancient tradition.\n\nMarfuggi said it was a relief that USTR opted for 25% tariffs instead of the 100% rate initially proposed, but he worries that buyers would switch to domestic or other foreign supplies if the tariffs stayed in place a long time.\n\n\u201cIf that happens, you\u2019re going to lose a considerable amount of consumer base, and it\u2019s hard to win that back,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd cheese hoarding cannot solve all the expected shortages, he warned. Many softer cheeses cannot be stored for nearly as long, so prices of those items will likely rise quickly.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a Gorgonzola lover, you\u2019re definitely out of luck,\u201d Marfuggi said.", "description": "Ambriola Co Inc's mammoth warehouse in West Caldwell, New Jersey, is crammed full of boxes and wheels of harder cheeses such as Parmigiano Reggiano, Pecorino Romano and Grana Padano - and more is coming, lots more.", "authors": ["Andrea Shalal", "Aleksandra Michalska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437409906&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF940DD-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
