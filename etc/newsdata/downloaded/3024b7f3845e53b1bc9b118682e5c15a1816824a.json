About a hundred Mongolians live in this town, as do immigrants from other parts of the world.\n\nBorolzoi and Narandelger Chinbat, a married couple who work in a factory that manufactures car seats, are among tens of thousands of foreign workers who recently moved to Hungary, lured by the country\u2019s rapid economic growth and acute labor shortage.\n\nUnder Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary has been one of the most stridently anti-immigration voices in the European Union. Yet officials have been less vocal about the country\u2019s own legal-immigration regime\u2014which recently became one of Europe\u2019s most liberal.\n\nGovernment officials couldn\u2019t be reached for comment for this article.\n\nHungary is suffering from a severe labor shortage caused by decades of emigration and declining birthrates. Hungary\u2019s population dropped by some 300,000 to 9.7 million in the past decade. Given robust economic growth and low unemployment, wages have been rising fast\u2014nearly 12% this year alone. Employers are struggling to fill about 80,000 vacancies.\n\nAbout a year ago, Mr. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government began expediting work permits, a move to attract qualified foreign workers who might have otherwise been drawn to more affluent nations in Western Europe. Under rules enacted in 2017 and 2018, recruiting companies are able to obtain permits in weeks instead of months.\n\nSince then, immigrants from Ukraine, Mongolia, India, Vietnam and other countries have been popping up in factories, on construction sites and in farms. The Hungarian government even invested in an advertising campaign to recruit workers from Ukraine and Serbia. Citizens of those two countries are now free to work without a permit in over 100 trades where vacancies are particularly high.\n\nA flag of Mongolia outside the Chinbats\u2019 home.

The government hasn\u2019t released statistics covering the time period since the start of the new rules, and it is difficult to estimate recent totals of foreign workers. Ferenc D\u00e1vid, a Hungarian labor economist and former head of the National Alliance of Employers, an employer association, estimates the figure to be between 150,000 and 200,000.\n\nGy\u00f6rgy Gask\u00f3 employs 21 Indian workers at one of his dairy farms. He says the government has made it much easier to hire from overseas. But heavy competition from Poland and Slovakia means he is often forced to add his own incentives.\n\nThe policy, he said, was \u201chugely controversial here because the government, especially Mr. Orb\u00e1n, constantly speaks against foreigners.\u201d\n\nMr. Orb\u00e1n told a conference this month that governments shouldn\u2019t accept immigration\u2014which he referred to as \u201cpopulation replacement\u201d\u2014as a solution to their demographic woes.\n\nCsongor Juh\u00e1sz, co-founder of Prohuman Ltd., a recruitment company that operates in several European countries, including Germany, said it was now easier to hire overseas workers in Hungary than in other EU countries.\n\nHe said he had been able to get work permits approved swiftly for automotive, construction and logistics workers from Ukraine, India and Vietnam. Typically, waiting time for groups of dozens or even hundreds of workers is eight to 21 days, compared with up to several months previously.\n\nHe and other recruiters now offer free accommodation and subsidized meals as well as provide interpreters and return trips to workers\u2019 home countries.\n\nMs. Chinbat, who works as a seamstress in the M\u00f3r car-seat factory, said she enjoys life in Hungary, even though she and her husband don\u2019t speak the language. She and her husband plan on applying for permanent residency once they have spent three years in the country.\n\nWork permits in Hungary typically are valid for two to three years. With renewals, some provide a pathway to permanent residency and, eventually, citizenship.\n\nSeveral recruiters said they had more difficulty bringing in citizens of Muslim countries, though they have had some success in the case of highly skilled specialists.\n\nEssam Tarik, a 23-year-old software engineer from Egypt, moved to Budapest with his wife in November to work at a tech company.\n\n\u201cI quite like it here, and I plan to stay longer,\u201d said Mr. Tarik. Two of his colleagues, both software engineers who joined the company this year, were recruited in Brazil.\n\nFigures from Eurostat, the EU statistics agency, showed the biggest migrant groups to be awarded residency permits\u2014which also cover the right to work\u2014in Hungary in 2017 were Ukrainians, Chinese and Serbs. By contrast, Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis, all from Muslim countries, were the most-represented nationalities among foreigners receiving residency in Germany that year.\n\nThe liberal opposition to Mr. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s nationalist Fidesz party has criticized the government for being too lax on immigration. Roland M\u00e1rton, a Socialist Party politician from the western city of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, has campaigned against the influx of about 2,000 Ukrainian workers to his community, which has been partially funded by the local government. He said the foreign workers have pushed down wages and strained the local government\u2019s budget and services.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Is Hungary\u2019s new approach to immigration one that should be emulated in other countries? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nOther countries in the region with governments that have spoken out against immigration have quietly adopted similar policies. Poland, with a population of 38 million, issued 680,000 first-time residency permits in 2017\u2014a record for any EU country in a single year, according to Eurostat\u2014and significantly more than Germany or France, which have 82 million and 67 million inhabitants, respectively. More than 86% of the Polish permits went to Ukrainians, some two million of whom now live in Poland.\n\nA draft of the Polish government\u2019s new immigration policy leaked in August and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal asserted that Muslims are often incapable of integration and that immigration should come from culturally close countries. The government declined to comment on the draft.\n\nMr. D\u00e1vid, the Hungarian labor economist, said immigration would continue to increase as the region\u2019s most skilled workers keep being drawn to Western Europe by higher wages.\n\n\u201cThis is it not a tragedy from the point of view of employment policy, nor is it a tragedy for society,\u201d Mr. D\u00e1vid said. \u201cThis is quite normal.\u201d\n\nInside the Chinbats\u2019 home.
