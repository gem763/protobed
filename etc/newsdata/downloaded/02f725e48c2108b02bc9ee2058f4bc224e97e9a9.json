Giuliani.\n\nIn their early May phone call, Putin \u201cdid what he always does\u201d in seeking to undercut the United States\u2019 relationship with Ukraine, said a former U.S. official familiar with details of the conversation. \u201cHe has always said Ukraine is just a den of corruption.\u201d\n\nThe efforts to poison Trump\u2019s views toward Zelensky were anticipated by national security officials at the White House, officials said. But the voices of Putin and Orban took on added significance this year because of the departure or declining influence of those who had sought to blunt the influence of Putin and other authoritarian leaders over Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOfficials cited the departures of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, both of whom had backed U.S. military assistance to Ukraine but were no longer in position to protect that stream of funding when it was suspended in the weeks leading up to Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton was also seen as a fervent backer of Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, but his relationship with Trump deteriorated rapidly this year before he was pushed out of the White House last month.\n\n\u201cOver time you just see a wearing down of the defenses,\u201d a former White House official said, describing the struggle to contest the influence of Giuliani, Putin and Orban.\n\nAD\n\nThe House impeachment inquiry is centered on Trump\u2019s alleged attempt to use the power of his office to coerce Ukraine into taking measures that the president hoped would help him in the 2020 election.\n\nAD\n\nThere is no evidence that Putin spoke about Biden or endorsed Giuliani\u2019s unsubstantiated claims that it was Ukraine \u2014 and not Russia \u2014 that had interfered in the 2016 election. Still, officials said that treating Ukraine as a pawn is consistent with Putin\u2019s approach toward the former Soviet republic.\n\nAmerican policy has for years been \u201cbuilt around containing malign Russian influence\u201d in Eastern Europe, a U.S. official said. Trump\u2019s apparent susceptibility to the arguments he hears from Putin and Orban is \u201can example of the president himself under malign influence \u2014 being steered by it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe official and others spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of internal discussions at the White House and the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAD\n\nIn his testimony, Kent indicated that U.S. officials were encouraged by Trump\u2019s initial phone call with Zelensky after his April election and hoped the president would see the new leader as a potential partner in long-standing U.S. efforts to help Ukraine fend off Russian aggression and battle internal corruption.\n\nInstead, Kent testified, Trump\u2019s view of Zelensky and Ukraine seemed to sour in the ensuing months, with Trump voicing disdain for Kyiv, ordering the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine removed, blocking Vice President Pence from attending Zelensky\u2019s inauguration and suspending the flow of $391 million in military and other aid to the country.\n\nAD\n\nTrump spoke with Putin by phone and met with Orban at the White House in the weeks between Zelensky\u2019s April 21 election and his May 20 inauguration. Trump also spoke with Putin on June 28, during a global summit in Japan, and by phone on July 31, days after the call in which he solicited a \u201cfavor\u201d from Zelensky.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has consistently refused to accept evidence that Russia interfered on his behalf in the 2016 election. Last week, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney confirmed that Trump had ordered aid to Ukraine suspended in part to compel Kyiv to investigate a debunked conspiracy theory that a hacked Democratic National Committee computer server was taken to Ukraine in 2016 to hide evidence that it was that country, not Russia, that interfered in the presidential election.\n\nIn a heated exchange at the White House last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) confronted Trump by saying, \u201cWith you, all roads lead to Putin.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump turned to Putin for guidance on the new leader of Ukraine within days of Zelensky\u2019s election. In a May 3 call, Trump asked Putin about his impressions of Zelensky, according to a Western official familiar with the conversation. Putin said that he had not yet spoken with Zelensky but derided him as a comedian with ties to an oligarch despised by the Kremlin.\n\nAD\n\nBefore running for president, Zelensky starred in a television sitcom in which he portrayed the Ukrainian president.\n\nThe May conversation with Putin coincided with a White House visit by Orban that many in the administration had opposed because of the Hungarian leader\u2019s moves to undercut democratic institutions in that country and his combative relations with U.S. allies in Europe.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI can tell you, knowing the president for a good 25 or 30 years, that [Trump] would love to have the situation that Viktor Orban has, but he doesn\u2019t,\u201d David Cornstein, Trump\u2019s ambassador to Hungary, said in an interview published by the Atlantic this spring.\n\nThe May visit from Orban began with an hour-long meeting between Trump and the Hungarian leader with no note-takers, officials said. Bolton and the Hungarian foreign minister joined afterward.\n\nAD\n\nSenior U.S. diplomats said they had limited insight into the private conversation between Trump and Orban, let alone how Trump\u2019s views of Ukraine have formed. But one official familiar with the encounter said that it became \u201cclear that the meeting with Orban had solidified\u201d Trump\u2019s pessimistic view about Kyiv and Zelensky.\n\nOrban\u2019s grievances toward Ukraine are grounded in a historic border dispute and the claimed mistreatment of a Hungarian-speaking minority that resides in Ukraine. But Orban\u2019s animosity toward Zelensky is also ideological, officials said, noting that Zelensky has positioned himself in opposition to Orban as a Western-leaning reformer.\n\nWhite House and State Department officials had sought to block an Orban visit since the start of Trump\u2019s presidency, concerned that it would legitimize a leader often ostracized in Europe. They also worried about Orban\u2019s influence on the U.S. president.\n\n\u201cBasically, everyone agreed \u2014 no Orban meeting,\u201d said a former White House official involved in internal discussions. \u201cWe were against it because [we] knew there was a good chance that Trump and Orban would bond and get along.\u201d\n\nThe effort to keep distance between Trump and Orban began to fray earlier this year with the departures of senior officials and the emergence of new voices around the president. Among the most important was Mulvaney, who became acting chief of staff in January and was seen as sympathetic to Orban\u2019s hard-right views and skepticism of European institutions. In Congress, Mulvaney\u2019s former Freedom Caucus colleagues last year backed Orban\u2019s efforts to kill a small U.S. grant designed to nurture independent media outlets in Hungary.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s involvement in approving the Orban visit was one of several instances in which he overruled national security officials, officials said. At the same time, Mulvaney also facilitated an arrangement in which Trump directed other diplomats, including the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, to work with Giuliani on his Ukraine agenda.", "description": "The Russian and Hungarian leaders reinforced Trump\u2019s view of Ukraine as a hopelessly corrupt country.", "authors": ["Greg Miller", "National Security", "Intelligence", "Greg Jaffe", "National Security Reporter", "John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "Ellen Nakashima"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0gksYWFkjirlbs2nMRNYdRKTzLo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X6QDUZDY3EI6TPJFZGEVKXTXMY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
