The preliminary event schedule for adults includes trivia night, book, crocheting and writing clubs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beacon for the city,\u201d said Dennis Walcott, president and CEO of Queens Public library. \u201cIts location is just ideal both for the borough of Queens but as well as for New York City overall \u2026 Being located between two ferries gives the opportunity for people to come over, visit and relax and surrounded by parkland as well. So it\u2019s a beautiful place for what libraries are about in today\u2019s society.\u201d\n\nThe opening of Hunters Point \u2013 the early design of which was reached by Steven Holl Architects in 2010, with construction starting in 2015 \u2013 is being seen as a positive sign for the health of New York libraries, and has been largely welcomed by the community despite some criticism over its price tag.\n\nWhen it opens today, it will become the 217th in New York, where libraries attract a total of 37.7 million people per year. In Queens, one of America\u2019s largest public library services, Walcott says none of the borough\u2019s residents lives more than approximately one mile away from a library.\n\nBut in the age of Donald Trump, whose administration has proposed budget cuts that would close the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the government agency that gives grants to libraries and museums, the high profile opening is a political statement, too.\n\nWhile most library funding comes from local sources, American Libraries Association (ALA) spokesperson Shawnda Hines said federal money is still \u201cvital\u201d for their survival. \u201cFor three years in a row, the Trump administration has threatened to eliminate IMLS altogether,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cObviously libraries are more important than ever under Donald Trump, who is assaulting our sense of decency and who has sought to dismantle the civic space and stability as we knew it,\u201d said Jimmy Van Bramer, local council member and chairman of New York City Council\u2019s cultural affairs and libraries committee.\n\nHe said Americans should respond to Trump by improving their libraries and other spaces where \u201cpeople can come together, talk, meet and actually defend their democracy and their neighborhoods\u201d.\n\nDespite increased internet access and growing distractions, libraries have proven remarkably resilient in the US, adapting their services to the changing needs of communities. Next year, libraries are expected to play a central role in the US census when, for the first time ever, it will be available online.\n\nAccording to the latest Public Libraries Survey report, published by the IMLS in May, although library funding across the US improved in the three years leading up to 2016, it remained below pre-recession levels.\n\nMeanwhile, visits remain relatively high. In 2016, there were 1.35bn visits to public libraries. This compares to 1.39bn the previous year.\n\nIt\u2019s in stark contrast to Britain, where last year nearly 130 public libraries closed.\n\n\u201cNo one would have predicted 30 years ago that of all the public institutions we have, the library would be the most adept at transforming to meet needs of contemporary citizens. But it has,\u201d said Eric Klinenberg, director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University and author of Palaces for the People.\n\nHunters Point, he said, is a reminder of the potential of public architecture. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to depend on tech firms and star architects to have beautiful buildings.\u201d\n\nCiting Oodi, in Helsinki, Finland, the current star of the library world, Central library in Calgary, Canada, and, in the US, Austin Central library in Texas and the library systems in Columbus, Ohio, Seattle and Chicago, he said \u201cthere are a lot of great libraries\u201d, but that America could still do better.\n\n\u201cThe American public library system is truly special by international standards. But that\u2019s only because we\u2019ve inherited a tremendous gift from the generations that have come before us and for the most part what we\u2019ve been doing is squandering our inheritance.\u201d\n\nThere has been some criticism of the project, however. Slow Build, a 2017 report by Centre for an Urban Future named Hunters Point library as an example of a project that \u201cgrew dramatically in scope and cost\u201d after being given the go-ahead.\n\nLast year a petition, signed by over 1,000 people called it \u201can embarrassment and a prime example of New York City government waste and inefficiency\u201d.\n\nIan Michaels, a spokesperson for NYC Department of Design and Construction, said: \u201cIn January 2019, the city released its comprehensive plan to improve capital project delivery, which will make the system more streamlined and more efficient. Had that plan been in place, the library would have been done much more quickly. Hunters Point library would also be a candidate for Design-Build [a contracting method connecting designers and contractors], which New York City is advocating for strongly in Albany.\u201d\n\nBut in Hunters Point, residents were excited about the opening. At a nearby play area, Luciana Santos, 31, who looks after two young children, had already looked at the library\u2019s events schedule.\n\n\u201cIt looks great \u2026 It took a while to get ready I think, but now everyone\u2019s excited for opening,\u201d she said.\n\nReading a book nearby with her daughter, Laura Varland, 33, said she currently goes to Court Square library, which is about a mile away, but plans to switch allegiance to Hunters Point when it opens because it\u2019s closer to home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful building,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an architectural design. It\u2019s taken a while to be built, so we\u2019ve all been watching it with bated breath \u2026 and waiting for it to open, so we\u2019re excited that it\u2019s finally opening.\u201d", "description": "The project earned criticism for its price tag, but it is being seen as a positive sign for the health of New York libraries", "authors": ["Miranda Bryant"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7248ec8dfd26759f2c6f986248769bb3e78f1ad/309_177_2289_1375/master/2289.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=615d841dc28c50f887c7fd4388ff0809", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
