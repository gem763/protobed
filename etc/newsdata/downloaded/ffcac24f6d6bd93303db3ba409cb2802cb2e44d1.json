It forced Christensen\u2019s resignation and prompted both the school and police department to issue public apologies and promises of reform.\n\nAccording to the 77-minute body camera footage, released by the police department, Christensen tackled the student after he and administrators said they tried for several days to get her to behave at school. In the video, Christensen can be heard recounting the complaints against her: disrupting class, standing up on the bus and taking too much milk at the cafeteria.\n\nAD\n\nChristensen later accused the student, who has not been publicly identified, of assaulting him and other school officials \u2014 allegations an internal affairs investigation found to be false.\n\nAD\n\nFarmington Police chief Steve Hebbe called the incident a failure.\n\n\u201cLike many of you, I was shocked and angry when I watched this video,\u201d Hebbe said in a statement. \u201cWe value our relationship with our community and will continue to work hard to maintain the public\u2019s confidence in our department.\u201d\n\nChristensen, who didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, stepped down after the internal investigation found he violated the department\u2019s use of force policies, Hebbe said. The department also reassigned and demoted Christensen\u2019s supervisor.\n\nAD\n\nInvestigators with the state police force and the San Juan County District Attorney\u2019s Office reviewed the case, but both agencies told the Farmington Daily Times that neither the officer nor the student would face criminal charges.\n\nHebbe told the newspaper that the student was diagnosed with a mild concussion and suffered scrapes and bruises. New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas (D) told local news that his office would also look into the matter.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cStudents should always feel safe in schools. I have called for an expedited investigation and will work directly with all proper authorities involved in this regrettable tragedy,\u201d he said in a statement to the TV channel KOB4.\n\nAD\n\nThe case highlights concerns shared by many social justice advocates over the role police officers play in schools across the country. Critics of the arrangement have said campus law enforcement disproportionately affects black and Hispanic students and operates with a lack of federal oversight.\n\nRaeford Davis, a former North Charleston officer turned policing reform advocate, said Christensen\u2019s actions were representative of a systemic problem.\n\n\u201cThis is not one bad officer,\u201d Davis wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis is American policing #JustComply mindset taken to its logically absurd conclusion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nChristensen\u2019s body camera footage begins about 35 minutes before he grabs the student and slams her to the ground. Christensen and other school officials can be seen following her around the campus while they wait for her mother to arrive.\n\nAD\n\nThe officer can be heard complaining that the student was \u201crefusing to do anything that anyone says\u201d and that \u201cthis has been an ongoing issue.\u201d Christensen told one of the administrators that he was trying to get approval to detain the student.\n\n\u201cThen I can put her in handcuffs,\u201d he said.\n\nChristensen and the school principal then followed the student inside the building, where she lingered by the front, picking at a sign taped to the door. Christensen asked the principal how much the sign was worth and threatened to arrest the student if she didn\u2019t stop toying with it.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you destroy it, it\u2019s called criminal damage to property,\u201d he said, raising his voice. \u201cI\u2019m going to charge you with criminal damage to property. Yeah, you\u2019re going to go to jail for 50 cents. Yeah, plus resisting, plus disrupting the education process.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMinutes later, when the student pushed the principal\u2019s hand away from the door and walked back out of the building, Christensen followed her. Grabbing her backpack, he yelled \u201cyou\u2019re done\u201d seven times and tried to force the student\u2019s arms behind her back. During the struggle, Christensen\u2019s camera fell off and recorded the rest of the incident from the ground.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna assault the principal,\u201d Christensen said, shoving her against the outside of the building.\n\nHe wrestled with her for nearly three minutes before letting her get up and walk away.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d she said, \u201cI want to go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get that option!\u201d he replied, shouting.\n\nAD\n\nHe again accused her of resisting arrest and assault \u2014 this time on him, too.\n\nPointing at the camera still filming from the ground, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s all on that camera right there.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The case forced the officer's resignation and prompted both school and police department to issue public apologies and promises of reform.", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xAo_1tPmrIs2x7hSWvQk76ecAkg=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-23-2019/t_46aa18380ee94fdf9e9ed0970fe0dcc4_name_Screen_Shot_2019_10_22_at_11_39_27_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
