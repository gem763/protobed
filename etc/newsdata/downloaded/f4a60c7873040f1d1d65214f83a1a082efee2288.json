The National Book Awards know this; today, they\u2019ve announced their finalists across five categories \u2014 the 25 books to move to the top of your stack. Just two of the writers on this year\u2019s list have been previous finalists, and both are in young people\u2019s literature \u2014 Jason Reynolds and Laura Ruby. Among the other nominees are four debuts \u2014 Kali Fajardo-Anstine\u2019s short story collection Sabrina & Corina and Julia Phillips\u2019 novel The Disappearing Earth in fiction, along with Sarah M. Broom\u2019s memoir The Yellow House and Albert Woodfox\u2019s memoir Solitary (with Leslie George, also a debut writer) in nonfiction. The translated literature category, now in the second year of its current incarnation, recognizes work translated from Arabic, French, Hungarian, Japanese and Finnish (including international sensations L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai and Yoko Ogawa).\n\nThe longlists came out last month, and if you\u2019re keeping score, a few notable picks didn\u2019t make the latest cut, including Taffy Brodesser-Akner\u2019s debut Fleishman Is in Trouble (currently being adapted into an FX limited series), Ocean Vuong\u2019s debut novel On Earth, We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous (which just earned the writer a MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d Grant), previous winner Colson Whitehead\u2019s novel The Nickel Boys, and Hanif Abdurraqib\u2019s fanboy essay collection Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to A Tribe Called Quest. Among the happy finalists are Vulture subjects Susan Choi (for her Rashomon-like teen #MeToo saga Trust Exercise) and Marlon James (whose Black Leopard, Red Wolf, is being adapted into a film by Michael B. Jordan). We won\u2019t learn the winners until the ceremony on November 20, leaving you plenty of time to study up.
