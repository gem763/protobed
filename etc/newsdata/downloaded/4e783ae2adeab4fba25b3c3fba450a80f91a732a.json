(will do this until she's old enough to understand and not want to match her mama) Xxx,' Erin captioned the sweet photo.\n\nEarlier in the day, The Footy Show presenter broke down in tears during an emotional appearance on WSFM's Jonesy & Amanda.\n\nTaking a toll: Earlier in the day, The Footy Show presenter broke down in tears during an emotional appearance on WSFM's Jonesy & Amanda\n\nThe 37-year-old journalist, who has been subjected to vicious online trolling over her 'rivalry' with Johns, told WSFM she was having a 'rough' time in the lead up to Sunday's NRL Grand Final.\n\n'I am so sorry, I haven't put my contacts in this morning,' she said, wiping tears away from behind her sunglasses.\n\n'I had a rough night. I didn't sleep very well and these are prescriptions.'\n\nThe radio appearance came amid reports Andrew Johns doesn't get along with Molan, who replaced Paul 'Fatty' Vautin on The Footy Show last year.\n\n'Joey [Johns] has never been a fan of Erin, which isn't fair because she works her a**e off... The whole Footy Show thing, with Fatty being booted, that is where it started to go sour,' an insider previously told The Daily Telegraph.\n\nReports: The radio appearance came amid reports Andrew Johns (R) doesn't get along with Molan, who replaced Paul 'Fatty' Vautin on The Footy Show last year\n\nJohns also removed himself from The Footy Show panel around the same time Vautin was replaced by Molan.\n\nMeanwhile, Johns also cannot stand the fact that Molan repeatedly interrupts her fellow Channel Nine commentators and giggles while on air.\n\n'He just doesn't like working with her,' a source told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday.\n\n'Joey is a stubborn bastard,' they added. 'If somewhere along the line she's p***ed him off he'll probably carry it around for the rest of his life.'\n\nJohns, Molan and Channel Nine have denied the existence of any feud.\n\nFollowing reports of a feud, Molan has been widely criticised online by NRL fans, who have made it clear they would rather see Johns in the commentary box.\n\n'I don't mind Erin, however, if I was the producer I would much prefer an immortal who can read and dissect the game and call things most others can't see than someone who has never played the game and reads the autocue,' one fan wrote on Facebook.", "description": "On the back of what has been an undeniably difficult few days, Erin Molan appeared to have been revelling in time at home with her one-year-old daughter, Eliza.", "authors": ["Demeter Stamell For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/11/19248210-0-image-a-69_1570100246069.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
