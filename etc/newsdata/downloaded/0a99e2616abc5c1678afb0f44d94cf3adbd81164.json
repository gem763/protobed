This includes implementing clearly signposted security and surveillance systems.\n\nShe added: \u201cIn the unfortunate event of an attack on an employee, it\u2019s crucial that employers ensure the wellbeing of all affected staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to meet with them, providing pastoral support and taking medical advice as needed.\n\n\u201cSuch support may be needed on a long-term basis, bearing in mind that violent incidents will often affect a victim for months, if not years.\u201d", "description": "Shop workers are suffering major mental health problems including post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of violence in stores, which has surged to a five-year high, according to a report.
