USA TODAY\n\nRENO, Nevada \u2013 Republicans are firing back after authorities in Nevada said they would investigate a protest staged at Reno-Tahoe International Airport.\n\nAirport officials were quick to apologize on Wednesday after roughly a dozen protesters confronted Elizabeth Warren, a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, on her way to a scheduled campaign appearance in Carson City.\n\nOfficials said in a tweet that the airport wasn\u2019t properly notified of the protest and that its attorneys planned to investigate the incident, which quickly went viral thanks to a video posted on Twitter by Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald.\n\nGOP operatives immediately cried foul. They say the airport launched no such investigation, and failed to apologize, after Republican former U.S. Sen. Dean Heller faced down Democratic protesters at the airport last year.\n\nSeveral replied to the airport\u2019s tweet with videos of the Heller incident and calls for the airport to end its \u201chypocritical\u201d handling of political protests.\n\nJeremy Hughes, President Donald Trump\u2019s Las Vegas-based regional political director, warned the airport to keep track of their emails in anticipation of an incoming public records request from the GOP.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t stand for your hypocrisy,\u201d he wrote in a Thursday morning tweet. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see who thought this was a good idea.\u201d\n\nNevada GOP spokesman Keith Schipper tweeted that airport officials\u2019 response amounted to \u201ccrocodile tears\u201d for Warren.\n\n\u201cThe leadership at Reno-Tahoe International Airport is riddled with hypocrites,\u201d Schipper added in a text message to the Reno Gazette Journal. \u201cThey sit on their hands and keep quiet when protests against Republicans break out in the airport, but wasted no time coming to the defense of Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nThis evening-just hours before his ritzy fundraiser tomorrow with President Trump-@SenDeanHeller was greeted by protestors at the Reno airport calling on him to reject Trump\u2019s money... just like he did in 2015. And per usual...Heller dodged the question. #NVSenpic.twitter.com/SUUJ9TtBjT \u2014 NV Dems (@nvdems) June 23, 2018\n\nElizabeth Warren: Elizabeth Warren joins Dems in criticism of Trump's June 18 call with China\n\nVideo of Wednesday night\u2019s protest shows around a dozen protesters following Warren to her car and shouting at her about socialism. The protesters also urged her not to support Trump\u2019s impeachment. At least one called her \"Pocahontas\" \u2014 an apparent reference to Trump's nickname for Warren, who has apologized for identifying as a Native American in the past.\n\nThe clip had been viewed more than 945,000 times as of Thursday morning.\n\nIn a lengthy statement issued late Thursday, the airport admitted neither protest was properly permitted and pledged to more rigorously enforce future events.\n\n\"While these events were different in tone and vitriol, they both highlight the need for the protest policy to be better enforced,\" wrote airport spokesman Brian Kulpin.\n\n.@RenoAirport Authority apologizes to @ewarren for the group of protestors on 10/2 in violation of airport policies. Airport Police weren't given prior notice of the arrival. Protestors didn't follow the permit process & the airport's attorney will be investigating the incident. \u2014 Reno-Tahoe Airport (@RenoAirport) October 3, 2019\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/03/republicans-cry-foul-over-probe-into-pro-trump-protest-reno-airport/3860499002/", "description": "Nevada Republicans accused the Reno-Tahoe International Airport of having a double standard on political protests.", "authors": ["James Dehaven", "Published P.M.
