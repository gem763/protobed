The project was much smaller in terms of production scale and plot, but leveraged that intimacy to tell the story of a family trying to heal after trauma drove them apart. It also centered on three black female characters, a rarity for the genre.\n\nDespite earning generally positive reviews at South by Southwest last year, \u201cFast Color\u201d struggled to find a distributor. The one it did find months later, Codeblack Films, served as an African American-focused branch of Lionsgate Entertainment \u2014 until Lionsgate severed that partnership in January. The film\u2019s marketing budget was slashed at the last minute, adding another obstacle to the already difficult course independent films must go through to find an audience in the ever-changing industry. In the end, it grossed just over $76,000 at the box office.\n\nAs of late this summer, however, audiences might get another chance to discover the dystopian world of \u201cFast Color,\u201d which received an outpouring of grass-roots support on social media after its quiet theatrical release. Amazon Studios is in the midst of developing the property into a television series, along with original screenwriters Julia Hart, who directed the film, and Jordan Horowitz, her husband; JuVee Productions, Viola Davis\u2019s company with her own husband, Julius Tennon; and LD Entertainment, which also produced the film. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\n\u201cWe loved this idea of the power of mothers, and the cliche that you could lift up a car if your kid was underneath it,\u201d Hart recently told The Post of the inspiration behind the story. \u201cI realized I\u2019d never seen a story about a mother who was literally a superhero.\"\n\n[Review: The excellent 'Fast Color' shows women of color with superpowers, literally]\n\n\u201cFast Color\u201d veers away from the more extravagant elements of the superhero films we\u2019ve come to know and instead focuses on the internal crises such characters might face. Gugu Mbatha-Raw plays Ruth, a recovering drug addict on the run in the drought-stricken American Midwest. She experiences seizures that cause earthquake-like tremors in the terrain around her, part of why she\u2019s being followed by government scientists who hope to harness the powers she cannot control.\n\nRuth\u2019s desperation leads her to return to the farmhouse she abandoned years ago, still inhabited by her mother, Bo (Lorraine Toussaint), and Ruth\u2019s daughter, Lila (Saniyya Sidney), both of whom have some sort of cosmic ability to see bright flashes called \u201cthe colors,\u201d as well as the power to disintegrate and reassemble objects with their minds. They work to better Ruth\u2019s emotional state by helping her regain control of her own powers, eventually realizing she can use them to save their decaying world.\n\n\u201cI loved the quiet strength of these women, effortlessly balanced by their vulnerability,\u201d Toussaint wrote in an email. \u201cThey reminded me of my mother and my grandmother. I knew these women. A woman\u2019s power can be a scary thing, especially to the woman herself, yet Julia so lovingly ushers each of these women into their fullness of being.\u201d (Mbatha-Raw declined to be interviewed.)\n\n\n\nHart, right, with her son on the set of \u201cFast Color.\u201d (Courtesy of Lionsgate)\n\nFor Hart, who didn\u2019t become a director until after having a child, motherhood was an enlightening experience. In writing her second feature with Horowitz, she realized she wanted to avoid simply dropping her characters into the existing tropes of a male-dominated genre.\n\n\u201cIn thinking about what sort of powers mothers would have if they had superpowers, it was this idea that women\u2019s power is creativity and creation,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just when we\u2019re talking about the ability to grow human life inside of us, but \u2026 coming together to fix things instead of coming together to fight.\"\n\nHart and Horowitz wanted Mbatha-Raw to play Ruth from the moment they watched her dynamic performance in Gina Prince-Bythewood\u2019s \u201cBeyond the Lights.\u201d But in casting a woman of color as the lead, the screenwriters, who are both white, realized they\u2019d have to tweak the script to fit a character whose life experiences would be outside of their own. In addition to doing \u201ca ton of reading\u201d \u2014 Hart had already sought inspiration from Toni Morrison\u2019s \u201cBeloved,\u201d as some critics picked up on \u2014 they worked closely with the actresses to tell a more truthful story.\n\nThe exploration of black womanhood isn\u2019t central to \u201cFast Color,\u201d but the potential for it attracted JuVee Productions, which makes a point of \u201cfinding these incredible characters and narratives with people of color, women of color,\u201d according to Tennon, the company\u2019s president of development and production.\n\n\u201cThe other thing that Viola spoke about and that we\u2019ve talked a lot about, too, is the idea of showing female superheroes in a way that a lot of the male superhero genres do,\u201d Andrew Wang, JuVee\u2019s head of television development, chimed in. \u201cIf you think about Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne, they\u2019re allowed to be antiheroes and complicated. Wonder Woman is not.\"\n\nDavis, who was unavailable for an interview, has played an antihero in \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d since 2014, Wang pointed out, adding that the show \u201cmade her into a global phenomenon and changed the way people perceive what a television lead looks like.\u201d Davis won an Emmy for the role in 2015, becoming the first woman of color to win in the lead drama actress category.\n\nWang said JuVee, which has a first-look deal with Amazon, was brought on because, with Davis\u2019s insight, it brings the \u201cperspective of an authentic experience\u201d to the characters. There\u2019s more real estate in television, meaning if \u201cFast Color\u201d receives a series order, it could expand beyond what was introduced in the film. Hart and Horowitz expressed an excitement in getting to build out other communities, some of which might have superheroes in them as well. Davis, per Wang, really connected with the idea of further exploring what it means to be a black mother with supernatural abilities.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be culturally specific,\u201d Wang explained. \u201cThere is no world where we could cast someone other than a black woman as the main role of this show. \u2026 That\u2019s what we\u2019re leaning into.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom left, Mbatha-Raw, Saniyya Sidney, David Strathairn, Lorraine Toussaint and Hart. (Courtesy of Lionsgate)\n\nHorowitz, a producer best known for working on \u201cLa La Land,\u201d noted that \u201cFast Color\u201d struggled to find a distributor because of the \u201cincorrect\u201d notion that \u201cthere isn\u2019t a ton of international value for women of color stories like this.\u201d Though it still felt right to release the film in theaters so critics would be more likely to write about it, he said, the traditional model of waiting at least 90 days between a film\u2019s theatrical release and its digital debut feels increasingly outdated for indie projects like this one.\n\n\u201cTheatrical is a really historical model that looks to what has come before,\u201d he explained. \u201cStreaming is more forward-facing, and it\u2019s about finding new audiences and new stories to tell for audiences. It\u2019s shifting, and we\u2019re still figuring out what kind of movies work in the world.\u201d\n\nWhile the wide reach of streaming services bodes well for the potential \u201cFast Color\u201d series, Hart described the feedback they received on the film as uniquely rewarding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weirdly more special, in a way, because if something has millions and millions of dollars in marketing, and it\u2019s in a hundred theaters, and everyone goes to see it, it\u2019s like, \u2018Cool, of course everyone did that, because it\u2019s the easy thing to do,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThere was something incredible about the fact that [\u201cFast Color\u201d] was so hard to find and so hard to see. The people who tweeted at me about driving 50 miles to go see it, I don\u2019t know. \u2026 It\u2019s been really special.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nViola Davis will play Michelle Obama in Showtime anthology series \u2018First Ladies\u2019", "description": "\"Fast Color,\" which once struggled to find a distributor, is now being developed into an Amazon television series.", "authors": ["Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter", "Sonia Rao Is A Pop Culture Reporter.
