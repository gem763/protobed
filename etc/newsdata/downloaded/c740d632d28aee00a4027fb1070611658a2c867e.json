He\u2019s good. He\u2019s a great martial artist. Good striking. Good wrestling. Good jiu-jitsu. I think he\u2019s got a lot of hype and he\u2019s a guy I can definitely beat. It\u2019s a fight I wanted to derail another hype train.\u201d\n\nAccording to the oddsmakers, Frevola is the underdog against betting favorite Pena. Underdog status is nothing new for the Gracie Tampa South lightweight. He\u2019s only been a betting favorite once in his UFC tenure.\n\n\u201cI love being the underdog,\u201d Frevola said. \u201cI love when people doubt me and proving them wrong. I\u2019m about to do it again Saturday night.\u201d\n\nFrevola, 29, will look to continue the momentum of his first UFC victory, over Jalin Turner at UFC 236 in April. Prior, Frevola fought to a draw against Lando Vannata and was knocked out by Marco \u201cPolo\u201d Reyes.\n\nAs for Frevola\u2019s opponent, \u201cViolent Bob Ross\u201d Pena finished Matt Wiman via third round ground-and-pound. In seven career victories, Pena has only gone to the judges\u2019 decision one time.", "description": "Matt Frevola is pulling no punches as he enters his fourth promotional bout against against Luis Pena at UFC on ESPN+ 19", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Christian Stein", "Farah Hannoun", "Dave Doyle", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/matt-frevola-ufc-236-post-fight-interview.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
