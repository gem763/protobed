What gets the eggheads excited is that it raises big questions about the nature of consciousness.\n\nDirected by Australian Matthew Lutton, the show aspires to the state of virtual reality, thanks to the shifting colours of Paul Jackson\u2019s lighting, and Jethro Woodward\u2019s wraparound sound design, which makes you feel like you\u2019re on board the spaceship itself\n\nMy biggest problem with both films was not so much figuring out their meaning as simply staying awake.\n\nThe tale is of a weirdly sentient distant planet, Solaris, that has developed its own consciousness and begun haunting the minds of the crew on a spaceship.\n\nAdding creepiness to downright weirdness, it brings their dreams to eerie life. Never mind figuring out what it all means, I found both films potently soporific.\n\nBetween the story\u2019s short scenes a huge shutter blinks over the widescreen stage and the heaving waters of the surface of Solaris are projected, as if from a dream\n\nSo the first great achievement of David Greig\u2019s fleet-footed new stage adaptation is that I didn\u2019t nod off.\n\nThe second is Hyemi Shin\u2019s white box set-design that recreates the spaceship\u2019s multiple interiors with the slick, Sixties finish of Star Trek\u2019s Enterprise.\n\nShin\u2019s staging conjures multiple locations: portals and passages; labs and sleeping quarters.\n\nBetween the story\u2019s short scenes a huge shutter blinks over the widescreen stage and the heaving waters of the surface of Solaris are projected, as if from a dream.\n\nDirected by Australian Matthew Lutton, the show aspires to the state of virtual reality, thanks to the shifting colours of Paul Jackson\u2019s lighting, and Jethro Woodward\u2019s wraparound sound design, which makes you feel like you\u2019re on board the spaceship itself.\n\nEven so, I couldn\u2019t help feeling sorry for the actors who have to compete with the seamless spectacle for attention.\n\nIndeed, the set gets to do more acting than the cast \u2014 sometimes literally, thanks to a video turn from Matrix and Lord Of The Rings star Hugo Weaving, who plays the ship\u2019s former captain, now deceased.\n\nAs that lover, Keegan Joyce (above) is more flamboyant \u2014 albeit increasingly plagued by his own arcane questions about the status of his consciousness as the embodiment of a memory from someone else\u2019s brain (we can but sympathise)\n\nThe sex of the new skipper has been switched, with the casting of Polly Frame, and while this is of little consequence, she is no George Clooney.\n\nFrame is wholesome, cheerful, occasionally quite concerned. But the role needs big\u2011name charisma to mesmerise us with the story of a woman haunted by a long dead lover.\n\nAs that lover, Keegan Joyce is more flamboyant \u2014 albeit increasingly plagued by his own arcane questions about the status of his consciousness as the embodiment of a memory from someone else\u2019s brain (we can but sympathise).\n\nYes, you\u2019re right: without giving too much away, there are at least two dead people on the prowl.\n\nSupporting roles are despatched efficiently but are sketchy. Instead, it\u2019s the set which \u2014 like Solaris itself \u2014 hogs the limelight.\n\nFast, at London\u2019s bijou Park Theatre, is no less peculiar, in a different way. It\u2019s the true story of quack dietician Linda Hazzard, who believed you could starve yourself into good health.\n\nShe operated out of a sanitarium called Wilderness Heights in Washington State and would, doubtless, prosper in Hollywood today. Between 1908 and 1912, she is believed to have killed 19 people \u2014 before doing the same for herself in 1938.\n\nDirected by Kate Valentine, there\u2019s never any doubt, in Kate Barton\u2019s 70-minute melodrama, that Hazzard was bona fide bonkers.\n\nPlayed by Caroline Lawrie, her bulging searchlight eyes sweep the audience and chill the blood. She holds forth with speeches of self-exoneration while swindling, isolating, and starving gullible patients.\n\nThe only thing missing is a moustache for her to twirl. With Natasha Cowley and Jordon Stevens as two of the hapless victims and Daniel Norford as a local reporter, it\u2019s a slight but diverting piece of social history.\n\nBrilliant Bryn is a riot in this jaunty classic\n\nDon Pasquale (Royal Opera House)\n\nRating:\n\nVerdict: Terfel\u2019s best comic turn\n\nDirector Damiano Michieletto keeps everyone on the move in Paolo Fantin\u2019s ingenious set, making good use of the revolve\n\nIt is almost a decade since we last saw Donizetti\u2019s comedy masterpiece at Covent Garden and this new production by an all-Italian team is the best since the classic Ponnelle staging of 1973.\n\nNot to spoil any surprises, Bryn Terfel\u2019s elderly Pasquale (pictured) is stuck in the Sixties, while Ernesto and Dr Malatesta are the epitome of today\u2019s Italian cool and Norina is a sparky young lady running a photographic studio. Clever use is made of 21st-century tech.\n\nSince he first essayed Italian buffo roles, Terfel has loosened up and is much funnier.\n\nHe is a big fellow \u2014 so was the original Pasquale, Luigi Lablache, later Queen Victoria\u2019s singing teacher \u2014 but moves like a Welsh rugby three\u2011quarter and still has the grand voice.\n\nMaking her Royal Opera House debut, Russian soprano Olga Peretyatko is an insouciant Norina with a touch of acid. Her Ernesto, Romanian tenor Ioan Hotea, makes a lovely sound.\n\nTiny flaws in their tuning will surely be ironed out as the run proceeds. Austrian baritone Markus Werba (as Dr Malatesta) lacks Italian roundness of sound but is a tidy singer and a convincing mainspring of the action.\n\nDirector Damiano Michieletto keeps everyone on the move in Paolo Fantin\u2019s ingenious set, making good use of the revolve. Donizetti wanted the opera in modern dress, so he would probably approve.\n\nFrom the first bar of the overture, Evelino Pido shows his command of Donizetti style. He gets lovely sounds from the orchestra \u2014 special nods to cellist Tim Hugh and trumpeter Ian Balmain.\n\nThe chorus is well marshalled in the servants\u2019 Act 3 scene. All I miss is the traditional reprise of the patter duet.\n\nThis opera is often accused of being heartless, but it is to everyone\u2019s credit that the composer\u2019s compensating warmth is well brought out.\n\nSee it broadcast live at your local cinema next Thursday, with an encore screening on October 27.\n\nTully Potter\n\nFrankenstein's monster mashup\n\nFrankenstein (Theatre Royal, Brighton, and touring)\n\nRating:\n\nVerdict: OMG! Mary Shelley goes like, millennial\n\nMary Shelley was just 18 when she started her novel that has stood the test of 200 years, so I struggle to believe she was any kind of airhead.\n\nRona Munro\u2019s excitable new adaptation of the gothic horror story, however, portrays Shelley as a giddy teenage diarist rather than the complex thinker she surely was.\n\nThe idea may be to make this production more \u2018relatable\u2019 to GCSE students, but it comes at the cost of dumbing down.\n\nPerformed with rubber-ball verve by Eilidh Loan, Shelley is on stage almost throughout, making up the story and telling her characters what to do.\n\nShe is, essentially, a literary bossy boots as she takes charge of Dr Frankenstein\u2019s ghoulish experiments.\n\nAt one point she congratulates herself, saying: \u2018That was a proper death bed scene . . . you\u2019re welcome!\u2019\n\nAll right, it got a laugh, but I\u2019m more interested in the action than Shelley\u2019s self-opinion.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Castle-Gibb\u2019s Frankenstein goes almost cross-eyed with self-reproach over his god-like presumption to create life.\n\nThe plight of his monster is slightly lost amid all the hand-wringing, but Michael Moreland\u2019s rangy zombie impresses as the anti-hero; he bestrides the stage like a buff and articulate Poldark extra.\n\nPatricia Benecke\u2019s production is easy on the eye, with a set that looks like Narnia before the thaw. Our actors shimmy up and down barren, white trees and disappear in and out of coffin-like doorways.\n\nTraces of Shelley\u2019s pre-woke thinking make it through the edit, including her insistence that great men needn\u2019t worry about small matters like conscience or family.\n\nBut after that stab in the eye for feminism, it ends with Shelley declaiming about power and responsibility in a story I could have sworn was more about liberty and daring.\n\nAlso opening\u2026\n\nThe Niceties (Finborough Theatre, London)\n\nRating:\n\nVerdict: Two heads talking about identity\n\nThe Niceties, is essentially two hours of two women \u2014 one young and black, the other older and white \u2014 talking at each other, with no possibility of slipping away from this small pub theatre until the interval.\n\nIt is a play about ideas, and whether you like it depends on whether you\u2019re engaged by the culture wars about identity, and whether millennials are thoughtful and socially aware young people or irritating snowflakes.\n\nActually, even if you can\u2019t abide this stuff, you may well be bowled over by the cracking performances.\n\nThis extended argument of a play stands or falls by the strength of the two protagonists, and Janie Dee as Janine, a liberal university professor, and Moronke Akinola, as Zoe, the millennial activist, are both utterly convincing.\n\nThey don\u2019t play their roles, they inhabit them, to the extent that the lady next to me, who came with her granddaughter, was utterly exasperated with Zoe for spending all her time on university activism.\n\nThe Niceties, is essentially two hours of two women \u2014 one young and black, the other older and white \u2014 talking at each other, with no possibility of slipping away from this small pub theatre until the interval\n\nEleanor Burgess\u2019s play of 2018, which has its European premiere in Matthew Iliffe\u2019s production, is set in an elite US university.\n\nJanine is discussing Zoe\u2019s essay: she says the reason America never had a radical revolution was that slaves were excluded from the process. Janine wants to see evidence, not a web page. Zoe prefers the evidence of her own feelings.\n\nAnd so we get into the minefield of whether top universities are for white elites, playgrounds for future investment bankers, addressing white concerns, and whether traditional academic scholarship is worth anything.\n\nZoe is quite fantastically irritating: quick to take offence, fabulously rude, and, it turns out, recording the whole conversation on her phone.\n\nIn the second half, Janine is surrounded in her office by packing cases; the public row about their quarrel has ended badly for both. Moreover, we find that Janine is in fact lesbian and working class: so, more identity issues.\n\nAt the end, the discussion ends: the women have nothing to say to each other. But it gives plenty for the rest of us to talk, and think, about.\n\nMelanie McDonagh\n\nThe Girl Who Fell (Trafalgar Studios 2)\n\nRating:\n\nVerdict: Whimsical fallout of teen suicide\n\nWelcome to the Trafalgar 2: a studio theatre smaller than my flat. We, the audience, are crowded round a tiny lit clearing of a stage and a shaky set to experience the fallout of a young girl\u2019s suicide.\n\nIt\u2019s a difficult tale to make witty and warm, even with the strong added whiffs of rom-com.\n\nDespite the serious \u2014 grim \u2014 subject matter, Sarah Rutherford\u2019s new work (which I saw in preview this week) is playful and light.\n\nBut it\u2019s also terminally shallow and emotionally slender. Between the mum (Claire Goose), the best friend and the boyfriend (Rosie Day and Will Fletcher giving us good flouncy teenager), and a stranger (Navin Chowdhry), we slowly learn what happened, and the impact it\u2019s had on their lives.\n\nWe jump uncomfortably (and unconvincingly) from jovial joshing to devastating drug problems and back again.\n\nMy least favourite theatrical blueprint (after dreadful shows which run chronologically backwards...I\u2019m looking at you, Merrily We Roll Along!) is the one where, prior to the action of the play, something huge has happened, and the ensuing drama is just a series of scenes which unveil that mystery.\n\nIt rarely works, and usually winds up being tiresome.\n\nThe circumstances of the suicide come to light agonisingly slowly, important interactions in the build-up are revealed, and some (pretty obvious) twists are thrown in; but it\u2019s all so undramatic and unsurprising.\n\nAt the centre is a fascinating crisis that\u2019s ripe for artistic examination: the effect of social media on young people\u2019s mental health.\n\nThe best friend, a Shakespeare-quoting teen with a short school tie who only drinks \u2018white chocolate mochas\u2019, says it would be more normal to \u2018run off to Syria\u2019 than delete Instagram. But that\u2019s as close as we get to exploring the problem.\n\n\u2018Social Media\u2019 is just dropped into conversation for relevance every so often, with the unfounded confidence of my Grandma saying \u2018DVD\u2019.\n\nThis isn\u2019t helped by the broad and sketch-like performances, which (when you\u2019re sitting 4ft from their faces) are quite a problem.\n\nThankfully, there is a streak of charming humour. Although a scene, played for laughs, where the mother is weeping and praying for her dead daughter, was a strange, uncomfortable watch.\n\nReal life \u2014 complete with real-life tragedies \u2014 is just as complicated and contradictory, but a million percent more convincing than this manufactured \u2018viral tragedy\u2019.\n\nLuke Jones", "description": "PATRICK MARMION: The tale is of a weirdly sentient distant planet, Solaris, that has developed its own consciousness and begun haunting the minds of the crew on a spaceship.", "authors": ["Patrick Marmion For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/01/19854454-0-image-a-13_1571357382520.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
