This is the Democrat Party now,\u201d Loesch told \u201cFox & Friends,\" disputing O'Rourke's claims that a majority of Americans agree with his position on the issue.\n\nAs part of his plan to curb gun violence in America, Biden is proposing that owners of assault-style weapons either sell their firearms through a voluntary buyback program or register their weapons with the government.\n\nBIDEN WANTS TO GIVE ASSAULT WEAPON OWNERS TWO OPTIONS: SELL YOUR GUNS TO THE FEDS OR REGISTER\n\nThe proposal is part of a wide-ranging plan the Democratic presidential candidate unveiled Wednesday ahead of his appearance at a gun safety forum in Nevada.\n\nBiden, like many of his rivals for the nomination, is calling for a ban on assault-style weapons. For current owners who don\u2019t sell them back, the former vice president proposes that such weapons be regulated under the National Firearms Act, which was enacted in the 1930s to cut down on gangland violence during the Prohibition era.\n\nBIDEN SAYS HE'S COMING FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s talking about is ultimately a repeal of the Second Amendment. He\u2019s talking about going after all semi-automatic firearms. There\u2019s no such thing as an assault weapon. You either have something that\u2019s semi-automatic or you have something that\u2019s select-fire, you have full auto,\u201d she added.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe gun control push from Democrats was evident at a recent presidential debate, where candidate Beto O'Rourke, a former congressman from Texas, generated a huge round of applause by vowing to use a mandatory gun buyback program to take assault weapons from Americans.\n\nMeantime, the White House has been in negotiations with lawmakers on measures like increased background checks.\n\nLoesch said the exact terms used to describe \"assault weapons\" are important because that dictates what law is implemented.\n\n\"Do more than virtue signal, demonstrate an understanding of the law that you want all of us to abide by.\"\n\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.", "description": "Nationally syndicated radio host and former spokeswoman of the National Rifle Association (NRA) Dana Loesch said on Thursday that former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s proposed\u00a0crackdown on assault-style weapons is the same as 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-03-at-11.50.44-AM.png"}
