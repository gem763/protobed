If the IEA's forecast plays out, it would bring total renewable capacity to approximately 3,700 GW by 2024.\n\nCapacity refers to the maximum amount that installations can produce, not what they are currently generating.\n\nSolar photovoltaics (PV) are due to make up nearly 60% of the expected rise, with the onshore wind sector accounting for 25% and offshore wind responsible for 4%. Photovoltaic refers to a way of directly converting light from the sun into electricity.\n\nThe IEA said that distributed solar PV \u2013 systems installed on commercial buildings, homes and in industry \u2013 would make up nearly half of the increase in the solar PV market.\n\nOverall, renewables' share in worldwide power generation is seen growing from 26% now to 30% in 2024.\n\n\"Renewables are already the world's second largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,\" Fatih Birol, the IEA's Executive Director, said in a statement issued Monday.\n\nThe IEA noted that challenges remained in the shape of \"policy and regulatory uncertainty, high investment risks and system integration of wind and solar PV.\"\n\nFor 2019, renewable power capacity additions are seen increasing by 12% following a stall last year.\n\nGrowth this year is being driven by solar PV, which has benefited from \"rapid expansion in the European Union\", a stronger Indian market and an \"installation boom\" in Vietnam. Growth in the onshore wind sector is also cited as a contributing factor.\n\n\n\nIn July, a research note from analysts at UBS said that 2018 saw global energy demand increase at its fastest rate since 2010.\n\nThe note said that although there was a \"growing desire\" to transition away from fossil fuels, \"demand for most energy resources, including fossil fuels\" would continue to rise.\n\nIt added that while renewable fuel supplies were set to increase at a fast pace, diversification from non-renewable resources would be expensive and time consuming.", "description": "Solar power is set to play an important role in the increase.", "authors": ["Anmar Frangoul"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106189466-1571398537922gettyimages-560091015.jpeg?v=1571398560", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
