He would scream every ten to 15 minutes and I would be up and down all night without fail, comforting him.\n\nChloe, pictured holding up a bottle of the spray, said beforehand she was 'constantly' up in the night with him which made bedtime 'really stressful and unenjoyable'\n\nThe former maternity ward photographer from East Sussex used the spray for a month to achieve the results. Joshua had been crying regularly as he had started teething\n\n'My husband Josh works nights, so to settle all four children on my own was a task in itself, and I\u2019d spend over an hour every night trying to appease everyone.\n\n'I really was at my wits end.\n\n'But my new routine is working wonders - I feed him, give a baby massage, pop him in his pyjamas and then use the pillow spray five to ten minutes before bed and slowly settle him down for the night.\n\n'He nods off almost instantly, sleeping through from 9pm for eight hours every single night I've used it.'\n\nChloe had been trying to find new ways to help Joshua sleep on his own for a while, and stumbled across the pillow spray, with the Very Hungry Caterpillar packaging catching her eye.\n\nAfter the magical results wowed her, the mother-of-four decided to invest in a bottle for herself and her three other children, Brooklyn, 12, Ava-Lily, eight, and Mila, five.\n\nThe spray is fragranced with Sicilian lavender, ylang ylang, jasmine, amber and mandarin.\n\nChloe said that she uses the pillow spray five to ten minutes before his bedtime every night\n\nThe 'magic' spray contains scents of Sicilian lavender, ylang ylang, jasmine, amber and mandarin, to help infants doze off comfortably\n\nChloe said: 'I\u2019m absolutely over the moon with the pillow spray, it has completely changed Joshua\u2019s bedtime routine and he is a much happier and more settled baby.\n\n'My husband didn't believe me until I started sending him pictures of Joshua fast asleep and now we've bought one for our bed and our other three children.\n\n'Before using the spray, I had no time for myself both during the day and in the evening.\n\n'Now Joshua is falling asleep at 9pm, I have time to do face masks and paint my nails.\n\n'I can spend time with my other children in the evening too and it finally means that when Josh has nights off we get some time to ourselves.\n\nChloe loved it so much she even invested in a bottle for her and her husband Joshua's bed. The 29-year-old account manager goes straight to sleep, she said, after coming in from night shift\n\n'I\u2019m in a much better place mentally, and have been enjoying TV series, reading to the girls and I\u2019m generally content knowing I can get in bed and have a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\n'The household is a much brighter place!'\n\nChristina Moss and Julia Yule, co-founders of Bloom and Blossom, added: 'With five children between us, we know the trials and tribulations of settling into a bedtime routine all too well, and we\u2019re delighted that Chloe has found a solution with our pillow spray.\n\n'We often hear from parents struggling with their little one\u2019s sleep and if we can help even a few mums and dads to create more positive bedtime routines, then we\u2019ve done our job.'", "description": "Mother-of-four Chloe Bashford, 26, from East Sussex, claims she got her youngest son Joshua to sleep from 9pm to 5am  every night after using Bloom and Blossom bed spray for a month.", "authors": ["Luke Andrews For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/10/19731986-0-image-a-22_1571130564089.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
