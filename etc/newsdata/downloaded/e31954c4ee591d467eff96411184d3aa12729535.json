Last year she sold just 40 properties \u2013 and all at reduced prices.\n\n\u201cWhen people list their home, what we say is: what\u2019s your hurt price?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then we need to go lower from there.\u201d\n\nScandal on all sides as Canada heads for \u2018election of discontent\u2019 Read more\n\nCanadians go to the polls on 21 October in a federal election still considered too close to call.\n\nA CBC poll tracker shows the opposition Conservatives holding a slim lead over the ruling Liberals \u2013 though neither is projected to win a majority government.\n\nBut the same poll tracker projects a Tory landslide in Alberta, where the Conservatives hold a nearly 45-point lead over Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals.\n\nAlbertans have long been wary of the Trudeau name \u2013 Justin\u2019s father Pierre forced the province to sell petroleum at a discount to the rest of Canada \u2013 but they did give the younger Trudeau the benefit of the doubt in 2015.\n\nIn the last federal election, the Liberals took four of the province\u2019s 34 seats. But even then, the provincial economy was starting to slow down. The drop in oil and gas prices the previous year sent unemployment soaring to north of 10%.\n\nThe local economy has stayed sluggish ever since \u2013 and many Albertans hold the prime minister responsible, accusing him of showing indifference to their plight and pandering to other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cI think the federal government has a specific hate on\u201d for Alberta, Moser said. \u201cWe have a federal government that wants to choke the Alberta economy for its own political reasons.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the province\u2019s oil sands \u2013 some of the largest petroleum deposits in the world \u2013 have come under attack from environmentalists who argue that extraction of the carbon-heavy fuel is incompatible with fighting climate change\n\nTrudeau has tried to play both sides of the climate issue. He promises to make Canada a climate leader and marched in recent climate protests.\n\nBut his government has also purchased the Trans Mountain pipeline, to ensure the completion of a project to carry Alberta oil to the west coast despite intense opposition from Indigenous groups and the government of neighbouring British Columbia.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Suncor tar sands processing plant near Fort McMurray, Alberta.

Total income in Alberta crashed by 20% between 2014 and 2016, while 130,000 jobs were lost in a province of 4.3 million, according to Trevor Tombe, an economist at the University of Calgary.\n\nIn the boom years, Alberta\u2019s prosperity attracted workers from across Canada and high school dropouts earned C$100,000 in boomtowns such as the oil sands hub Fort McMurray.\n\nThe boom, the bust, the darkness: suicide rate soars in wake of Canada's oil crisis Read more\n\nLloyd George moved to Alberta from Nova Scotia in 2001 with little more than ambition and two suitcases. Nearly 20 years later, he runs an oil supply company, providing specialty pipes for petroleum projects.\n\nHe\u2019s staying profitable, he says, though business would be \u201cdouble or triple\u201d with a better economy \u2013 and more pipelines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been four years of kicking someone while they\u2019re down,\u201d he said of the Trudeau government\u2019s treatment. \u201cWe\u2019re in an abusive relationship and we can\u2019t leave because there\u2019s nowhere else to go.\u201d\n\nLong the malcontents of the Canadian confederation, Albertans complain the province\u2019s oil bounty is spread to other provinces through equalisation payments.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s home province has been the largest recipient of such payments \u2013 a fact not lost on Albertans, who note that Quebec opposes pipelines, even as tankers transport oil down the St Lawrence River.\n\nAmid the perceptions of antipathy from the federal government, some in the province have even revived the idea of separating from Canada. \u201cI\u2019d support it,\u201d George said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll hate it every step of the way.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in Canada, the environment has emerged as a key issue for voters, but in Alberta \u2013 a region whose economy depends on fossil fuels, voters seem indifferent to the climate crisis, despite the wildfires that tore through Fort McMurray in 2016, and record floods which inundated Calgary in 2013.\n\nThe disasters \u201chad little impact on public sentiment\u201d, said Keith Brownsey, professor at Mount Royal University in Calgary. \u201cDependence on oil and natural gas has led to a focus on the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change is a secondary issue here.\u201d", "description": "With the province\u2019s economy still sluggish the climate crisis seems to be a secondary issue for voters in Canada\u2019s federal election", "authors": ["David Agren"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d470dabdaabd0ace0bafdf0c271cb97f2cf2698/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=345260f119feec90054e320ecce91ed1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
