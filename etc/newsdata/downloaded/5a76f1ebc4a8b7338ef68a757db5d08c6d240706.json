One census tract next to the plant has the highest cancer risk anywhere in America due to airborne toxicity, 50 times above the national average, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency [EPA].\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lydia Gerard and Robert Taylor in Tokyo.

We want to give them this information,\u201d Gerard, whose husband, Walter, died of cancer last year, said to security guards in front of the building\u2019s second-floor reception area.\n\nWalter was diagnosed with the disease two years before the 2015 release of the EPA report.\n\nAfter failing to get a response, Gerard tried again. \u201cCould someone from Denka please come down and receive this,\u201d she said, referring to the health study by the UNHR, a US-based civil society group that organised their trip to Japan.\n\nSurrounded by guards and several men in business suits who could not be identified as their lanyard IDs were facing inwards, she added: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to talk to them or receive any information, we just want to hand this to someone from Denka.\u201d\n\nThe toxic emissions in Reserve, a town in St John the Baptist parish \u2013 a predominantly black, working-class community \u2013 come primarily from the Pontchartrain Works facility, the only place in the US to manufacture the synthetic rubber neoprene.\n\nReserve is the focus of a yearlong Guardian series, Cancer Town, examining the fight for clean air in the town, as well as other communities in the area between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, known colloquially as Cancer Alley.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The former Dupont, now owned by Denka chemical plant located in Reserve, Louisiana on 11 July 2019.

The Japanese government, however, does not class chloroprene as a dangerous chemical, and no public records are kept on chloroprene emissions in Omi, on the Japan Sea coast, where Denka runs the only plant in the country that manufactures the chemical, but via a different process than the one used at its plant in Reserve.\n\nWhen the group travelled east of Tokyo to Chiba prefecture, home to a large Denka chemicals plant, staff told them that the facility did not produce chloroprene and politely declined requests for an impromptu guided tour of the facility similar to those offered to local schoolchildren.\n\nThe Reserve plant, originally built by the US chemicals giant DuPont, went into operation in 1968. The firm sold it to Denka just before the damning EPA report was published in 2015.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Japan the day before their fruitless visit to the Denka HQ, Gerard, who was born close to the plant and raised a family there, said her husband \u201chad always been healthy, and we believe that [his cancer] was the result of chloroprene from the Denka facility.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to move. The plant has to bring emissions down, or it has to move. It\u2019s Denka\u2019s responsibility to be good neighbours, but they don\u2019t see the need to bring emissions down. There is no reason why they can\u2019t do what is necessary.\u201d\n\nTaylor and Gerard, accompanied by Ruhan Nagra, the executive director of UNHR, found their paths blocked by security guards as soon as they entered the second-floor lobby that houses the Denka headquarters.\n\nThe confrontation, witnessed by the Guardian, lasted around 25 minutes and ended after a stocky man in dark sunglasses who appeared to be head of security repeatedly asked the three to \u201cleave the building immediately\u201d and refused to accept and pass on the UNHR study.\n\nThe standoff was a repeat of an unsuccessful attempt Taylor and Gerard had made to enter a Denka shareholders\u2019 meeting during their first visit to Japan in July.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t talk to us,\u201d said Taylor, whose adult daughter, Raven, is ill with a rare intestinal disease \u2013 gastroparesis \u2013 that he said doctors had tied to chloroprene. \u201cThis is the way they treat us \u2013 like we\u2019re nothing. We get the same from DuPont and Denka even though they\u2019re in my front yard, and from the governor of Louisiana. This strategy is pointless \u2013 they\u2019re never going to allow us in there. We\u2019re seen as the low-hanging fruit because we are the least able to protect ourselves.\u201d\n\nAt least one security guard followed Taylor, Gerard and Nagra to a subway station on the opposite side of the road.\n\nOutside in the drizzle, Gerard reflected on another unsuccessful attempt to engage with the company she blames for the cancer that killed her husband.\n\n\u201cThis all goes to show what big business feels about people like us,\u201d she said, sheltering beneath an umbrella. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear what we have to say. They all want us to go away and be quiet. But we\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d\n\nBut she and Taylor voiced hope that their visit would generate more interest in their plight in Japan, where the media have largely ignored the claims made against the company. Following their most recent visit, a major daily newspaper and a weekly business magazine have reportedly said they plan to run articles on the issue.\n\nUNHR did manage to secure a meeting with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation [JBIC], which helped finance Denka\u2019s purchase of the DuPont plant.\n\n'Almost every household has someone that has died from cancer' Read more\n\nJBIC officials refused to discuss its involvement in the Denka project, however, citing ongoing litigation involving Denka, according to Nagra. At its meeting with Nagra, Taylor and Gerard, the bank would only talk in general terms about the procedures it follows when financing projects, she added.\n\nThe JBIC classifies the Denka plant as a category C project, meaning that it has determined that the plant \u201cis likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impact\u201d and requires no environmental review or monitoring.\n\nJBIC representatives refused to discuss why the bank had selected that classification when pushed by Nagra. It is not clear if a C classification would prevent Reserve residents from filing a complaint via the JBIC\u2019s in-house grievance process.\n\nMinutes after he and Gerard were left with no choice but to leave the Denka building, Taylor struggled to hide his bitterness towards the company \u2013 for its refusal to countenance that it is responsible for dangerously toxic air, and for its apparent disregard for the victims and their families.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so insignificant to them that they set the dogs on us to prevent us from going in,\u201d he said. \u201cTo talk to us would be to admit that we\u2019re human. It\u2019s like they\u2019re saying, \u2018We can dump anything we want on your community and you have to sit down and let it happen.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Residents of Reserve, Louisiana aimed to present evidence to Denka that its plant\u2019s toxic emissions are responsible for high rates of cancer in their town", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f38a1cd787b1c93bde48de183fdc900996db0e/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dbb0ee0c4ced507f856b3de2df7f0229", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
