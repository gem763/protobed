Eat 30 different plant-based foods each week. 2. Move and exercise as much as possible to regulate your bowel movements and increase the diversity of your gut microbes. 3. Avoid unnecessary medications and smoking, as there is growing research to suggest these can impact our gut microbes.\n\nWhen it comes to improving your general gut health, alongside eating as many as 30 different plant-based food each week, Dr Rossi said we should all move more.\n\n'Exercise helps to regulate your bowel movements and increases the diversity of your gut microbes,' she said.\n\n'Yoga has also been shown to reduce stress, which can have a profound on your gut health due to the gut-brain axis.'\n\nThe doctor believes we should all avoid unnecessary medications and smoking, as there is 'growing evidence to suggest some medications can impact our gut microbes'.\n\n'With your diet, there's no one specific food or food group we should eat more of - it's all about diversity, getting as much variety of plant-based foods as possible and hitting our recommended fibre intake of 30g per day,' Dr Rossi said.\n\nDr Rossi's diagram shows a plate that consists of vegetables - which takes up the majority of the space - fruits, herbs and spices, fermented dairy, wholegrains, protein-rich foods and fats\n\nWhat does the ideal day on a plate look like?\n\nAs a starting guide for her clients, Dr Rossi said she always shares what an example of good gut health might look like on a plate.\n\nDr Rossi's diagram shows a plate that consists of vegetables - which takes up the majority of the space - fruits, herbs and spices, fermented dairy, wholegrains, protein-rich foods and fats.\n\n'This is just a guide, and can be tweaked according to your microbes and preferences,' Dr Rossi said.\n\n'The most important thing to remember is that you choose whole instead of refined foods.'\n\nWhen it comes to fermented foods, Dr Rossi said the research supports the hype around folate and vitamin B12.\n\n'Fermented dairy like kefir also has the best evidence for gut health so far,' she said.\n\n'But more research needs to be done.'\n\nWhat are some of the most simple ways to get more fibre? 1. Add flavour and texture to your favourite soup by stirring in cooked barley or legumes. 2. Sprinkle mixed seeds on you breakfast - whether it's cereal, toast or eggs. 3. Replace a third of the mince in your lasagne with cooked lentils for a twist your gut will love. 4. Keep your skin on both your fruit and vegetables. 5. A small handful of nuts, seeds and dried fruit is a quick way to boost your fibre when you're in a rush. 6. Make the switch from white to wholegrain and seeded bread.\n\nDr Rossi (pictured) said that the biggest thing to increase in your diet is fibre, which helps to feed the different bacteria in your gut\n\nCan you drink alcohol if you want a healthy gut?\n\nDr Rossi is the author of the new book Eat Yourself Healthy (pictured)\n\nLastly, Dr Rossi tackled the issue of whether you can drink alcohol if you want a healthy gut, and thankfully for those who are inclined to enjoy a glass of wine or two, it's not all bad news.\n\n'While alcohol in excess can increase gut permeability - which is often referred to as \"leaky gut\" - research shows that red wine in moderation is linked with good gut health, measured by increased bacterial diversity and anti-inflammatory gut bacteria,' she said.\n\nHowever, before you go and open up a bottle, the expert revealed you shouldn't move too fast:\n\n'One glass a week or fortnight was enough to show some benefit,' she said.\n\n'So you shouldn't feel guilty if you're not over-indulging much.'\n\nDr Rossi is the author of the new book Eat Yourself Healthy, An Easy-to-Digest Guide to Health and Happiness from the Inside Out.\n\nFor more information, please click here.", "description": "A leading gut health expert has busted the biggest myths surrounding gut health - and revealed the three simple things everyone can do to improve their general digestive system.", "authors": ["Sophie Haslett For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/04/19236724-0-image-a-36_1570074094888.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
