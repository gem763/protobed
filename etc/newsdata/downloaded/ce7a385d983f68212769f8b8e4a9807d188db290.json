It said in September that the bank expected to book a provision of GBP600 million to GBP900 million.\n\nThe London-listed lender made an pretax loss of GBP8 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of GBP961 million in the year-earlier period, after returning to profitability in 2017.\n\nRBS's net loss came to GBP315 million, compared with a profit of GBP448 million a year earlier.\n\nTotal income for the quarter fell to GBP2.90 billion from GBP3.64 billion in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nNet interest income fell to GBP2.01 billion from GBP2.15 billion a year earlier. RBS said its net interest margin, the difference between the money it earns on lending and pay out on funding, decreased by seven basis points compared with the second quarter.\n\nRBS ended the quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio--a key measure of balance-sheet strength--of 15.7%, which included a 50 basis point reduction in respect of the PPI charge.\n\nThe bank also reaffirmed its previous outlook guidance for the full year, with revenues forecast to be GBP12.31 billion, taken from FactSet and based on 15 analysts' estimates.\n\nWrite to Sabela Ojea at sabela.ojea@wsj.com; @sabelaojeaguix\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 02:46 ET (06:46 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
