I'd always wanted to go to Italy - it was one of my dreams. When I arrived, I was in love.\n\n'The Trevi Fountain was on my list since it's one of the things you can't miss when in Rome.\n\n'I went there three times and the pictures were taken the first time I went.\n\n'It was around 9am and a girl asked me to take pictures of her, we talked for a bit and found out she's from Montr\u00e9al too.\n\nAlycia was on a two-week road trip around Italy which saw her take in many other sites including the city's Colosseum\n\nHer mother Cynthia, pictured here with Alycia and Alycia's father Dennis, spotted the romantic moment as the family looked through pictures from the road trip\n\n'She offered to take pictures of me and she went 'wait, there's a couple kissing in the background of your pictures, we should move to take some without them' so I looked back and laughed.\n\n'I love art, history and nature so Italy was the perfect match for it.\n\n'I went to Rome, Florence, Naples, Pompeii, Sorrento, Positano, Bari, Lecce and Tivoli then back to Rome.\n\n'It's so lovely, I hope I can find them because they might want these really cute pictures.'", "description": "Student Alycia Savard-Ouellet, 19, from Quebec unwittingly captured the romantic moment while posing in front of the Trevi Fountain in Rome while on a two-week road trip around Italy.", "authors": ["Luke Andrews For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/09/19981356-0-image-a-2_1571645657212.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
