It seems BMX pro Matt Whyatt doesn't win The Bachelorette, as he was pictured last month on a romantic date with Married At First Sight 'villain' Jessika Power\n\nThey looked very comfortable in each other's company, with Matt wrapping his arms around Jessika's waist and affectionately rubbing her shoulders.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt exuded bad boy charm in a striped T-shirt that showcased his sprawling arm tattoos, a pair of black shorts and a backwards facing baseball cap.\n\nMeanwhile, Jessika flaunted her curvy figure in a tight white T-shirt dress.\n\nCaught in the act! The pair were spotted passionately kissing while spending the day together on the Gold Coast on September 22, just weeks before The Bachelorette season premiere\n\nShe slung a black messenger bag over one shoulder and completed her casual look with a pair of tan leather sandals.\n\nAfter saying goodbye to Matt, Jessika jumped into her car and drove away.\n\n'It looked like she had stayed with him for a few days', an onlooker said.\n\nGetting handsy! They looked very comfortable in each other's company, with Matt wrapping his arms around Jessika's waist and affectionately rubbing her shoulders\n\nEarlier in the day, the pair were seen returning to Matt's apartment after visiting a local McDonald's restaurant.\n\nThey shared a lively conversation as they strolled down the street together.\n\nJessika clutched a take-away beverage as she showed off her flat stomach in a white crop top and mini skirt.\n\nShacking up? 'It looked like she had stayed with him for a few days', an onlooker said\n\nIt comes after Daily Mail Australia revealed that Matt and Jessika had 'spent the night together' after meeting at a Gold Coast nightclub in early September.\n\nMultiple sources confirmed the pair flirted up a storm inside the YOT Club, before leaving together and going back to Matt's place.\n\n'They were all over each other in their private booth, they didn't care who saw them,' said an insider.\n\nBreezy outing: Earlier in the day, the pair were seen returning to Matt's apartment after visiting a local McDonald's restaurant\n\nOnce the pair were back at Matt's, they cheekily sent a 'disappearing photo' of themselves in bed together to some of the other Bachelor contestants on Instagram.\n\n'Everybody in The Bachelor world was gossiping about Matt's hook-up with Jessika in the secret Bachelor group chats,' another source revealed.\n\n'Some of the girls even seemed a bit jealous because they were hoping to have a shot with Matt on Bachelor in Paradise.'\n\nWho needs The Bachelorette? They shared a lively conversation as they strolled down the street together\n\nBefore spending the night together, Jessika had shared a photo of herself cuddling up to Matt inside the nightclub on her public Instagram story.\n\nThe pair appeared quite close in the photo, with a scantily-clad Jessika leaning in close to the BMX daredevil, who smiled while pointing at her cleavage.\n\nMatty's antics will leave Channel 10 publicists fuming, as contestants on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette are contractually required to keep a low profile on social media to avoid spoiling the show.\n\nLooking good! Jessika clutched a take-away beverage as she showed off her flat stomach in a white crop top and mini skirt\n\nOnce the show is airing, all of their Instagram posts and captions must be approved by Channel 10's publicity department until their elimination has aired.\n\nIf Matt happens to be the 'winner' of Angie's season - which now seems highly unlikely - it will be interesting to see how she reacts to his night with Jessika.\n\nMeanwhile, Angie has confirmed she is still dating the person who wins her heart, telling The Project on Wednesday she is 'very, very happy' with her new man.\n\nScandalous! It comes after Daily Mail Australia revealed that Matt and Jessika had 'spent the night together' after meeting at a Gold Coast nightclub in early September\n\nEyewitness account: 'They were all over each other in their private booth, they didn't care who saw them,' an insider said of their nightclub hook-up\n\nHow will Angie take the news?
