We have spoken to witnesses, but we are interested in further information from anyone that has made any observations,\" he said.\n\nTom Rowsell, who was having lunch outside the cathedral where he is to be married this weekend, told daily Aftonbladet he saw two men dash from the building toward a motorboat waiting on Lake Malaren.\n\n\"I saw a white little boat with an outboard motor on the back. The two men hurriedly jumped on board and it sped off,\" he said.\n\n\"I knew immediately they were burglars, because of the way they were behaving,\" he added.\n\n'Not possible to sell'\n\nThe theft occurred just before noon on Tuesday, and police quickly had helicopters, patrols, and search dogs looking for the thieves but their efforts have so far proved fruitless, Dangardt said.\n\n\"There is of course going to be a lot of media interest in these types of objects. There will be pictures in the media. It's just not possible to sell these kinds of objects,\" the national police coordinator for thefts of cultural artefacts, Maria Ellior, told news agency TT.\n\n\"So we can only speculate about (the thieves) intentions,\" she added.\n\nSimilar heists have occurred before.\n\nIn 2013, King Johan III's burial regalia was stolen from Vasteras Cathedral. It was recovered several days later in a garbage bag left on a a countryside road, following an anonymous tip.\n\n\"One can hope that something like that will happen in this case,\" Ellior said.\n\nThe perpetrators of Tuesday's heist risk up to six years in prison for aggravated theft.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Robbers who nabbed two 17th century royal crowns and an orb from a Swedish cathedral remained at large after fleeing their daring midday heist by motorboat.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7743/ecac9e88b6734fddb6bba77ed8cabfad.jpg", "published_at": "2018-08-01"}
