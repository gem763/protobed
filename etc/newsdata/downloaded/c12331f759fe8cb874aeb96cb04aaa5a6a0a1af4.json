And it represented a subtle but notable shift from what he\u2019s been saying as signals of a potential economic slowdown have increased. The latest came Tuesday with a report that U.S. manufacturing contracted last month for the first time in three years.\n\nAD\n\nAfter touting the benefits of his trade war for months, Trump has made three key concessions in the past few weeks on matters he had earlier denied or deflected: American companies pay the tariffs on the goods they import; those costs can be passed on to consumers; and those increased costs can lead to an economic slowdown.\n\nAD\n\nBut Trump\u2019s acknowledging that the U.S. stock market is likely to have taken a hit from his trade war is perhaps his most telling trade war concession. Trump has tethered his job performance as president to the stock market and regularly criticized his predecessors when stock market performance was poor.\n\nThe Trump vs. Obama economy \u2014 in 15 charts\n\nFor months, Trump blamed the Federal Reserve for the slowing of U.S. economic growth and for the volatility in U.S. markets.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf [the Fed] would have not done the quantitative tightening, our market would have been up another 10,000 points,\u201d Trump said in June.\n\n\u201cIf [interest rates] weren\u2019t raised so fast, you would see another, probably, 10,000 points on the Dow,\u201d Trump said in July.\n\nNow, as Trump\u2019s own economic policies undermine his stated economic goals, he is pivoting from touting immediate benefits of a trade war to talking up long-term benefits of a trade war, while painting himself as willing to take political risks to achieve them.\n\nThe question for Trump is whether voters will see it that way, too.\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cIf I wanted to do nothing with China, my stock market \u2014 our stock market \u2014 would be 10,000 points higher than it is right now,\u201d President Trump said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Jm Rieger", "Video Editor For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/folDzJ4h5S3bl1Zh3WrS088x980=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-04-2019/t_c9d4ee0ac0944858a85d6f4bf891d68d_name_3e491ed6_cf50_11e9_a620_0a91656d7db6_scaled.jpg"}
