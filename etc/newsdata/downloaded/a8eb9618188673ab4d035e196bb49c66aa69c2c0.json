Miley and Kaitlynn decided to end things after a month of dating/lots of public make outs.\n\nBut don't get too upset about it\u2014Miley and Kaitlynn remain on good terms, and Kaitlynn even left a sweet message on Miley's Instagram earlier today. Plus, according to a source, \"They\u2019re still friends. They\u2019ve been friends forever and were there for each other when they were both getting separated, but they\u2019re just not in a romantic relationship anymore.\"\n\nPhoto credit: Chris Wolf/Star Max - Getty Images More\n\nFor those of us wondering why Milynn decided to call it quits, apparently, it's partially because Miley isn't too interested in being in a couple right now. A source tells People, \"Miley doesn\u2019t want a serious relationship...She and Kaitlynn spent every day together and it just wanted anything that Miley wanted to continue doing. She wants to focus on her career.\"\n\nIf you can remember all the way back to last month, you'll also recall that Miley and Kaitlynn got together right after Miley announced her split from husband Liam Hemsworth, so it makes total sense that she doesn't want to hop right back into something.\n\nNeither Miley nor Kaitlynn has acknowledged the split on social media, but Miley is pretty unpredictable, so it should be interesting to see what she does next...\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "I guess they got pretty serious in a month! \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "authors": ["Alanna Lauren Greco"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DckxFGSkDi8vS2xB1p1fDA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/ec941099c05e241690ab6b00609494f6", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
