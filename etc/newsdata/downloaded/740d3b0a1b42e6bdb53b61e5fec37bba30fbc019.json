Don\u2019t blame us, the book\u2019s authors and NYT reporters told Lawrence O\u2019Donnell last night on MSNBC. Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly claim that their submission of the \u201cadaptation\u201d from their book included the fact that the supposed victim of Kavanaugh at a second party doesn\u2019t have any recollection of the incident. The editors removed it, they tell a credulous O\u2019Donnell, because of sensitivity to using the names of victims of sexual assault.\n\nWell, that\u2019s one explanation (via Leah Barkoukis):\n\nPlot thickens.\n\nRobin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly claim that the qualifier about the other alleged Kavanaugh accuser not remembering an incident at Yale was included in the initial NYT draft but removed. pic.twitter.com/p9wUTnFyM1 \u2014 Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) September 17, 2019\n\nNormally, however, editors work with contributors on their submissions. The process usually requires a last look by contributors to the edited material for any last-minute issues created by the editing. Why did the two reporters sign off on the submission rather than insist that the key sentence be restored to provide the proper context, perhaps with a redaction in place of the woman\u2019s name? O\u2019Donnell doesn\u2019t ask, and the two never volunteer an answer.\n\nMollie Hemingway isn\u2019t buying it for another reason. First, as she initially noted on Twitter, the two sat around for at least a full day without speaking up about the missing sentence and context, even when it started getting noticed. More importantly, though, Hemingway discovered that the two left out the same information in an NPR interview that was taped late last week before the NYT \u201cadaptation\u201d had been published:\n\nIn response to a question about any other women coming forward, the authors excitedly tell Max Stier story, never mentioning that they never spoke to the woman or that she denied it through several friends. Difficult to blame this on editing. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 17, 2019\n\nNot only that, but the two also discuss with NPR how Leland Keyser helps to establish Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s credibility without ever once mentioning that Keyser told them explicitly that she doesn\u2019t find Blasey Ford credible. That\u2019s before they get to Stier\u2019s story, which was a secondhand bit of gossip about something so inconsequential that the alleged victim doesn\u2019t recall it at all. The authors also claim that they \u201chaven\u2019t found motivations for them to lie,\u201d even though Blasey Ford\u2019s attorney admitted last week that part of their motivation in coming forward was to defend Roe v Wade and to \u201cput an asterisk\u201d next to Kavanaugh\u2019s name in perpetuity.\n\nChristine Ford's lawyer Debra Katz says putting \"an asterisk\" next to Kavanaugh's name in case Kavanaugh attacked Roe v. Wade \"is part of what motivated Christine.\" pic.twitter.com/zoFr2T8Aec \u2014 Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) September 4, 2019\n\nThis explanation is basically nonsense, in other words. Kelly and Pogrebin authored a hit piece in the NYT that ignored important context and contradictory information because they\u2019ve been ignoring both all along. The NYT column was part and parcel of a dishonest smear campaign that has been in motion since the summer of 2018 in an attempt to intimidate Roe-critical jurists. If the editors did remove the exculpatory sentence, it was only in service to the same mission that the authors intended all along.\n\nIt is interesting, however, to see Pogrebin and Kelly throw their editors at the NYT under the proverbial bus. Will the editors return the favor? The plot is definitely thickening, as Chuck Ross says.\n\nUpdate: Should one of the authors have disclosed that she was at Yale the same time as Kavanaugh? Perhaps not that, but her connection to activists might have warranted a more thorough mention. Via Twitchy:\n\nDid you know Robin Pogrebin was a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh? I didn\u2019t until last night\u2014seems to be an important detail she should disclose in her reporting: https://t.co/VhVC9sXbE9 \u2014 Julie Kelly (@julie_kelly2) September 17, 2019\n\nThat by itself probably doesn\u2019t merit a disclosure. A lot of people attended Yale in some form or fashion during Kavanaugh\u2019s years there. Being on campus doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you know everyone or participate in every event. By itself, it\u2019s not a conflict of interest. Of course, that\u2019s not exactly \u201cby itself\u201d either, as Mollie Hemingway points out:\n\nMore than that, Pogrebin was long-time roommates at Yale with Kathy Charlton, a woman centrally involved in the anti-Kavanaugh efforts (according to public statements from her husband). That she was roommates is briefly disclosed, but Charlton's coordinating role is not. https://t.co/izJYFqAl3X \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 17, 2019\n\nSo the latter point was disclosed but perhaps not fully explained. That seems like a curious choice for authors concerned about credibility, but probably one of the more minor points in this saga. How much influence did Charlton have on Pogrebin in reporting this story, especially in the form it took at the Times?", "description": "\"We certainly never intended to mislead in any way ...\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/odonnell-pogrebin-kelly.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
