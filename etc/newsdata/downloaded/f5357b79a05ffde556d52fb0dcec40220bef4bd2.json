As a technologist and Indigenous person in that environment and then seeing all the layoffs, I knew I wanted to do things differently,\u201d Ward said.\n\nDifferent meant building a values-based for-profit business that would allow him to use his skill set and technology to support and advance Indigenous peoples.\n\n\u201cThere was and is a digital divide between Indigenous people and the rest of Canada,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, our people need to get online and I can help them do that.\u201d\n\nSocial enterprises are broadly defined as revenue-generating for-profit or not-for-profit organizations that want to be good citizens and make a positive social, economic or environmental impact. Their numbers are on the rise, largely due to two key trends: Growing consumer/investor awareness around the social impact of their spending and investing, and the increasing access to capital for social enterprise entrepreneurs.\n\nThe number of socially conscious consumers has risen by 170 per cent in the past 20 years and the global social finance market is projected to reach $1 trillion by 2020, according to Making an Impact: Ontario\u2019s Social Enterprise Progress Report, a report by the province\u2019s previous Liberal government.\n\nFor Ward, the timing of his business idea was right and the need was there. Ward incorporated Animikii, which means thunderbird in Ojibwe and is also his spiritual name, and began working with non-profits, First Nations and M\u00e9tis communities on Indigenous-focused projects that in some way improve their lives.\n\nThat focus continues to advance Animikii\u2019s growth across its service lines \u2014 software development, websites, graphic design and digital communications \u2014 turning the digital agency into a one-stop shop to help people get online.\n\n\u201cMany Indigenous entrepreneurs are already running a social enterprise. They just aren\u2019t calling it that,\u201d said Ward, a Business in Vancouver 2019 40 under 40 Award winner and sought-after speaker on social enterprise. \u201cThis country was founded on business and social enterprise. The fur trade was an economic relationship where Indigenous people were exporting goods internationally for the benefit of our people and community.\u201d\n\nAnimikii also funds a scholarship for Indigenous youth in technology and entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cThat aspect of giving back for the benefit of community is ingrained in how many Indigenous people do business,\u201d Ward said. \u201cThat\u2019s also true of First Nations communities, which have an economic development focus. Individuals and entire communities are running social enterprises.\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not just Indigenous people who are interested in social enterprises.\n\nFor example, Umang Dua founded Mississauga, Ont.-based TrySight Inc., which develops products and technologies for people with low vision \u2014 defined as visual impairment that can\u2019t be fully corrected with glasses, contact lenses, medication or eye surgery.\n\nDua launched TrySight in 2008 when he was 25 years old with the goal of making a social impact, having been inspired by his grandmother, who was losing her sight from low vision. The software engineer, who had worked as a consultant for IBM and become disillusioned with the corporate world, decided to solve her problem.\n\nAs a student at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, he had designed a technology to help people living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease), who are unable to move or speak, to communicate. He wanted to have that same impact in his working life.\n\n\u201cI wanted to know that I was making someone\u2019s life better in some way,\u201d he said.\n\nDua\u2019s first product was computer screen magnification software that also read out emails, so anyone with low vision could access their computer. But it wasn\u2019t until he attended a trade show in Florida in 2009 and landed a $500,000 order from the United Kingdom government that he knew the business could be a success.\n\nI wanted to know that I was making someone\u2019s life better in some way TrySight founder Umang Dua\n\nTrySight recently received a $1-million grant from the federal government\u2019s new Accessible Technology Program, which invests in hardware and software solutions that help Canadians with disabilities overcome barriers, to develop artificial intelligence-based glasses that will tell users what\u2019s around them, and it has also benefited from tax credits from the Scientific Research and Experimental Development program.\n\nToday, Dua has eight employees and a suite of 10 products and four technologies used by 800,000 people in more than 16 countries. His clients are largely institutional \u2014 the Toronto District School Board is a significant client \u2014 and TrySight has increased revenues by 25 to 30 per cent increase each year over the past five years.\n\nSimilarly, Animikii during the past four years has grown to 11 full-time staff, five contractors and is hiring for three open positions. In 2016, Animikii became the first Indigenous company in Canada and second in North America to become a B Corporation, certifying it as a company whose entire social and environmental performance meets the highest standards.\n\n\u201cBefore that, it was, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re doing a niche thing.\u2019 Now I\u2019m receiving interest and validation from the mainstream social impact world,\u201d Ward said.\n\nAnimikii this year received funding from Raven Indigenous Capital Partners, a new Indigenous-led venture fund that invests in Indigenous social enterprise.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re developing a new product focused around Indigenous data sovereignty that will allow people to design data sets, control their own data access and possess their own data,\u201d Ward said. \u201cWe\u2019re building a tool that will bridge that digital divide and hopefully scale Indigenous technology in a way never before seen.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post", "description": "Social enterprises are on the rise amid growing consumer awareness around the impact of spending and increasing access to capital", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/social-enterprise.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
