Near the end of the event, Sandberg promised to \u201ckeep listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople in our communities are dying at the hands of white supremacy \u2014 the stakes are that high,\u201d said Jessica J. Gonz\u00e1lez, co-founder of Change the Terms and vice president of strategy at Free Press, who attended the event. \u201cNow that Facebook has heard some of our stories and calls for change, there can be no doubt about the path forward: We at Change the Terms urge them to adopt all of our policy recommendations. The safety of users must be a priority on the platform.\u201d\n\nGonz\u00e1lez said the Facebook assumed mostly a \u201clistening posture\u201d throughout the town hall, hearing concerns about \u2014 among a litany of other pressing issues \u2014 a lack of transparency around how changes in its enforcement policies are being carried out. In late March, Facebook instituted a policy barring \u201cpraise, support and representation of white nationalism and white separatism,\u201d for example. It has also made some strides to update the methods by which hateful content is analysed and reviewed.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez added that data scientists she\u2019s met with are eager to analyse how the changes are impacting the platform, but finding it impossible to do so; something they attribute to a lack of participation by Facebook.\n\nFree Press, the digital and consumer advocacy group, issued a report ahead of the meeting on Thursday morning titled Facebook vs. Hate. The report examined how Facebook\u2019s policies have evolved since October 2018 when the Change the Terms coalition was launched. Facebook officials have sat down with members of coalition dozens of times over the last year, Gizmodo was told.\n\nWhile the report acknowledges that Facebook has dedicated considerable resources toward addressing hate on its platform, it nevertheless finds that enforcement of its policies remains \u201clacklustre.\u201d\n\n\"Gov't. should never be in control of categories of speech, but it can play the role of incentivizing good behavior by working w/ industry to create standards, and helping combat the spread of violent content, i.e. the Christchurch video.\" \u2014KJ Bagchi @AAAJ_AAJC #CivilRightsxTech pic.twitter.com/69fYJgxjNh \u2014 Free Press (@freepress) September 26, 2019\n\n\u201cFacebook still struggles to enforce its policies, and it has intentionally built flexibility into its Community Standards on hate speech,\u201d the report states. \u201cThis flexibility allows hateful activities to thrive when they don\u2019t technically \u2018cross the line.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThough Facebook conducts a trusted-flagger program, which fast tracks review and highlights content flags by vetted organisations and individuals, it\u2019s not clear how effective it is,\u201d the report adds.\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe civil rights leaders also pressed Sandberg on enhancing the training of its moderators, to include cultural competency. One leader cited the harrowing report published this February by the Verge that detailed the serious mental health issues that notoriously plague Facebook\u2019s army of moderators, whose job involves exposing themselves to an onslaught of hate speech, violent images, and graphic pornography.\n\nThey also expressed dismay over Facebook\u2019s announcement this week that it wouldn\u2019t seek to block any content posted by politicians that violate its hate-speech rules, and that politicians\u2019 posts would not be subject to any fact-checking. Facebook\u2019s critics say they\u2019ve essentially given politicians free rein to engage in disinformation campaigns aimed at swaying the results of the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cFacebook should get rid of this embarrassing policy which allows millions of elected officials around the world to engage in the most vile of speech on Facebook\u2019s platforms,\u201d said Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Centre for American Progress. He noted, in particular, a raise in hate-speech against Latinos that he says has been encouraged by the White House.\n\n\u201cAt this civil rights town hall we have heard repeatedly that this is a mistake that puts people of colour and religious minorities in danger,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis year, the Latinx community has been targeted and murdered in mass violence events orchestrated and promoted by white supremacists on social media platforms like Facebook.\u201d said Daiquiri Ryan, a policy counsel at the National Hispanic Media Coalition. \u201cWhen hate infiltrates, invades and spreads online, we lose yet another safe space for people of colour to authentically tell their stories, participate in the digital economy, and engage in political discourse.\u201d", "description": "A diverse group of civil rights leaders sat down in Atlanta in the U.S. on Friday for a town hall attended by Facebook officials, including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, to discuss the matter of hateful content, racist threats and misinformation that continue to plague the platform....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "James Whitbrook"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/yaa0l3hduwtaiizzxnmd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
