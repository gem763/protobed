The twist revealing that the airport deal predates his administration could boost Trump's case.\n\nTRUMP PROBES ROCKET TO FRONT OF DEM AGENDA, AS PRESIDENT DISMISSES NEW ETHICS COMPLAINTS\n\nPolitico, which was among the outlets to publish stories this week examining the relationship between the Air Force and the resort, reported that the Air Force crews stayed at Trump\u2019s Scottish resort up to 40 times since 2015.\n\nIt also reported that the contract with the Prestwick Airport was in fact signed during the Obama administration. The Washington Post also reported that the airport was sending visiting crews to Trump\u2019s course before he ran for president.\n\nThe Air Force said in a statement that relatively few crews stayed at Trump Turnberry between 2015 and 2019.\n\n\u201cWe reviewed the vast majority of the 659 overnight stays of Air Force crews in the vicinity at Glasgow Prestwick Airport between 2015 and 2019. Approximately six percent of those crews stayed at the Trump Turnberry,\u201d the statement from an Air Force official said. \u201cAs a practice, we generally send aircrews to the closest, most suitable accommodations within the government hotel rate. The review also indicated that about 75 percent of the crews stayed in the immediate vicinity of the airfield and 18 percent stayed in Glasgow.\u201d\n\nThe Post noted that no evidence has emerged to show Trump did anything to alter the existing arrangement since entering office. The New York Times, meanwhile, found that the deal involved the Air Force paying a discounted rate of as little as $130 a night, compared with a typical rate of more than $300 a night. It was one of 13 hotels booked by the airport, and is approximately 40 minutes away from the airport.\n\nTrump has dismissed criticism on the issue, saying he had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the stops.\n\nAIR FORCE DEFENDS STOPOVER: TRUMP'S SCOTLAND HOTEL WAS THE CHEAPEST AROUND\n\n\u201cI know nothing about an Air Force plane landing at an airport (which I do not own and have nothing to do with) near Turnberry Resort (which I do own) in Scotland, and filling up with fuel, with the crew staying overnight at Turnberry (they have good taste!). NOTHING TO DO WITH ME,\u201d Trump tweeted on Monday.\n\nStill, Trump continues to face concerns about other government functions at his properties, including the pitch to hold the next G-7 meeting at his Doral resort in Florida.\n\nDemocrats have indicated they are zeroing in on the administration\u2019s use of Trump Organization properties, which they claim violates the Emoluments Clause and could feed their case for impeachment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLast week, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., penned a letter to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and Secret Service Director James Murray seeking information about Trump\u2019s \u201capparent promotion and solicitation of foreign and U.S. government business at Trump Organization owned or affiliated properties.\u201d\n\nFox News' Lucas Tomlinson and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "description": "The controversial arrangement by the U.S. Air Force\u00a0to refuel at a Scottish\u00a0airport near President Trump\u2019s Turnberry golf resort apparently was signed\u00a0under the Obama administration, according to multiple reports.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/obama-trump-AP-Reuters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
