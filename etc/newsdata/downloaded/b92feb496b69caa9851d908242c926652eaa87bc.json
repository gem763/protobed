USA TODAY\n\nA Georgia judge has ruled that a wrongful death lawsuit involving a stuntman and a fatal fall on the set of \"The Walking Dead\" in 2017 will go to trial in December.\n\nJohn Bernecker died from injuries suffered on the Gwinnett County, Georgia, set of the hit AMC show about zombies, when he fell headfirst from a balcony 22 feet high and landed on concrete instead of air-bag crash pads, on July 12, 2017. He died two days later.\n\nHis mother, Susan Bernecker, is suing AMC, Stalwart Films, the producer and a long list of other defendants, including actor Austin Amelio, who was the only other person on the balcony at the time of Bernecker's fall.\n\nThree motions filed by the defendants seeking to toss the lawsuit were pending before state Judge Emily Brantley. She issued three rulings, beginning Sept. 19 and culminating in a third ruling Tuesday that rejected the defendant's motions, giving the go-ahead for a trial that is to start Dec. 9.\n\nNorman Reedus as Daryl Dixon in an episode of 'The Walking Dead.'

(He also represented the family of Sarah Jones, a 27-year-old camera assistant killed on a railroad track on the set of the Gregg Allman biopic \"Midnight Rider\" in Georgia in 2014. A jury awarded nearly $4 million to her family after a trial in 2017, and the railroad owner eventually settled the case.)\n\n\"John Bernecker was an amazing person,\" Harris said in a statement to USA TODAY on Friday. \"We're grateful that the judge made the correct legal ruling and will allow a jury to decide this case. We're looking forward to telling John's story in court in December.\"\n\nAmong other issues, the defendants' lawyers asserted an \"assumption of risk\" argument in one of their motions for summary judgment: that Bernecker understood the risks of performing the stunt in which he was fatally injured.\n\n\"Defendants argue that Bernecker was an experienced stunt manand that he knew what he was doing and had been hurt on stunts many times before. In other words, Bernecker knew the risk of his profession and voluntarily engaged in this act,\" Brantley wrote in her Oct. 8 ruling. \"The Court does not agree.\"\n\nIn the same ruling, Brantley also denied the defendants' motion to exclude testimony from stunt expert Conrad Palmisano, based on Georgia's admissibility of evidence rules.\n\n\"The Court finds that Mr. Palmisano is highly qualified to testify regarding the effect that unscripted and unplanned physical contact would have had on the performance of a high-fall stunt, and his testimony is sufficiently supported and reliable to be admissible to assist the jury in its deliberations on issues they may not ordinarily be familiar with or understand,\" Brantley wrote.\n\nCLOSE When she\u2019s not spending time with her grandchildren, 68-year-old Terrie Hamrick is likely dressed as a zombie as a \u201cwalker\u201d for \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d TV series AP\n\nAMC sent a statement to USA TODAY responding to the rulings:\n\n\u201cThis was a tragic accident,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile we continue to believe our motions for summary judgment were appropriate and supported by the facts in this case and the law, we respect the Court\u2019s decision \u2014 without making any determination on the merits of either side\u2019s arguments \u2014 to allow the case to proceed.\u201d\n\nMore: 'Walking Dead' stuntman fell head-first on concrete, report says\n\nBernecker's mother filed the lawsuit in January 2018, alleging AMC \"orchestrated and enforced a pattern of filming and producing 'The Walking Dead' cheaply and, ultimately, unsafely.\"\n\nMore: 'The Walking Dead' stuntman's mom files wrongful death suit\n\nAccording to her lawsuit, AMC pressured Stalwart Films to keep budgets unreasonably low, leading filmmakers to cut corners on safety precautions.\n\nAMC said in a statement in 2018 that it takes the safety of its employees very seriously and meets or exceeds industry safety standards on set.\n\nThe Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued a \"serious citation\" to production company Stalwart Films after investigating the incident, according to a statement released last January.\n\nMore: 'Walking Dead' film company fined for stunt mishap that killed John Bernecker\n\nOSHA proposed penalties totaling the \"maximum allowable\" fine of $12,675 for the company\u2019s \"failure to provide adequate protection from fall hazards.\"\n\n\u201cThis tragedy should serve as a wake-up call for the entertainment industry,\u201d Kurt Petermeyer, OSHA Atlanta regional administrator, said in the statement. \u201cThe entire industry needs to commit to safety practices for actors and stunt people involved in this type of work.\u201d\n\nContributing: Associated Press, Bryan Alexander\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/11/walking-dead-stuntman-death-judge-rules-lawsuit-should-move-forward/3938109002/", "description": "A Georgia judge denied defendants' motions to toss a wrongful death lawsuit involving a \"Walking Dead\" stuntman.
