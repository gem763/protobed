A source said: \u2018As we ramp up campaigning ahead of a general election, we are maximising the use of the resources we have to ensure we are successful. Karie will drive this crucial work from HQ, as she did during the last election.\u2019\n\nAnd Ian Lavery, the party chairman, tweeted: \u2018A brilliant move by JC to ask Karie Murphy to spearhead our general election campaign.\n\n\u2018She is a hero of our party and movement \u2013 her drive, commitment and sheer political determination is awesome.\u2019\n\nIt was reported that matters came to a head after Andrew Fisher, the head of policy and the author of the party\u2019s last manifesto, quit last month. He was talked out of leaving immediately after delivering a scathing assessment of the \u2018blizzard of lies and excuses\u2019 emanating from Mr Corbyn\u2019s office.\n\nA Shadow Cabinet ally said Jeremy Corbyn (pictured with Karie Murphy at the Labour Party Headquarters in central London in June 2017), who tends to avoid confrontation, had \u2018screwed up his courage\u2019 to make the move\n\nThe Guardian said it was Mr Fisher that finally convinced Mr Corbyn a shake-up was necessary.\n\nA Shadow Cabinet ally said the Labour leader, who tends to avoid confrontation, had \u2018screwed up his courage\u2019 to make the move.\n\nIt is understood Miss Murphy resisted the switch to the party headquarters on Victoria Street, Westminster.\n\nIt is unclear whether she will return to a chief of staff role in Downing Street if Labour wins power.\n\nTensions have been running high since Labour\u2019s conference in Brighton last month, which kicked off with a botched attempt to abolish Tom Watson\u2019s job of deputy leader.\n\nThe attempted coup against Mr Watson was initiated by Momentum chairman, Jon Lansman, but he told friends it had the approval of Corbyn\u2019s office.\n\nMiss Murphy is widely believed to have known about the move in advance.\n\nThe former nurse has had a long career in the Labour movement, including several years on Mr Watson\u2019s staff.\n\nIn 2013 she tried to become Labour candidate in Falkirk, but the selection process was suspended following allegations of vote-rigging. Miss Murphy was cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nA source close to Mr McDonnell said he had no role in the staffing of the leader\u2019s office or Labour HQ.", "description": "After weeks of infighting, Karie Murphy - an ally of union baron Len McCluskey - has been removed from the Labour leader's Westminster office.", "authors": ["Daniel Martin Policy Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/00/19466774-0-image-a-101_1570575842122.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
