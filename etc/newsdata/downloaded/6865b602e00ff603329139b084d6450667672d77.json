(AP) - Running back Cyrus Habibi-Likio says Oregon\u2019s defense in practice is as good as - or even better than - some of the teams the Ducks have faced so far.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like game day, every day out there in practice. Game day,\u201d he said.\n\nOregon\u2019s D has been revived under new defensive coordinator Andy Avalos, and it is having a historic run for the No. 12 Ducks.\n\nAfter dropping its season opener against Auburn, Oregon has reeled off five straight wins. The Ducks now sit atop the Pac-12\u2019s North Division at 3-0, their best start in conference play since 2013.\n\nThe stats are impressive.\n\nOregon is ranked third nationally in allowing an average of just 8.7 points per game. Over the five-game winning streak, the Ducks have given up just one touchdown while outscoring opponents 195-25. They\u2019ve kept all five of those opponents to single digits in scoring for the first time since 1958.\n\nAs for Pac-12 play, Oregon has held its first three conference opponents to under 10 points for the first time since 1933.\n\nThe Ducks\u2019 D has stopped opponents from scoring a touchdown on nine straight trips into the red zone. Additionally, Oregon has allowed just one TD over its opponents\u2019 last 63 drives, forcing 21 three-and-outs.\n\n\u201cIf you look back at us at during spring ball, you saw a complete transformation of the defense, the way it\u2019s taught, the way it\u2019s coached, the scheme itself. The amount of pride taken by the players is still the most impressive thing. These guys attack it, and I get to watch it every single day. So, I\u2019m certainly excited for what is to come,\u201d Oregon coach Mario Cristobal said.\n\nThe defense will face a new challenge on Saturday when the Ducks visit No. 25 Washington (5-2, 2-2). Huskies coach Chris Petersen knows Avalos well: he was on Petersen\u2019s staff at Boise State.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys that has stayed on a constant state of improvement and figuring out how to do it a little bit better but stayed true to your roots and what you believe in fundamentally and philosophically and all those things. Those guys play at a high level. There are not assignment errors going on out there. You\u2019re not going to get anything easy on them,\u201d Petersen said.\n\nAvalos is Oregon\u2019s third defensive coordinator in four seasons. He was hired to replace Jim Leavitt, who parted ways with Oregon after two years after never seeming to mesh with the Ducks. Avalos spent seven seasons at Boise State before arriving in Eugene. And so far, it seems like it\u2019s been a good fit.\n\n\u201cObviously we\u2019re still growing in a lot of different ways, but we love the direction we\u2019re obviously going right now,\u201d Avalos told reporters Wednesday.\n\nDuring Oregon\u2019s 45-3 victory at home over Colorado last Friday, safety Verone McKinley III had a pair of interceptions, becoming just the second freshman in the nation with two. He also had a career-high five tackles and was named the Pac-12\u2019s Player of the Week.\n\n\u201cThe man\u2019s a genius,\u201d McKinley said about Avalos. \u201cEver since he first got here, he\u2019s stepped in and we\u2019ve loved him. We love him an we appreciate having him.\u201d\n\nOregon held the Buffaloes to just 299 total yards, the third straight opponent kept to under 300.\n\n\u201cOh man, the way our defense is playing, they\u2019re definitely playing top of the nation,\u201d receiver Jaylon Redd said. \u201cHow they\u2019re playing, they take the weight off our shoulders, and at the same I\u2019m putting weight on my shoulders just because I want to help the defense so much because I see they\u2019re busting their behind to make everything right. They get three-and-outs almost every drive.\u201d\n\nAvalos said the defense will need consistency heading into the second half of the season, with a tough slate of games on the road against the Huskies, USC and Arizona State.\n\n\u201cIt sounds cliche, but it\u2019s really about how we prepare in here,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019ve got to pick that up and obviously keep the focus.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Running back Cyrus Habibi-Likio says Oregon's defense in practice is as good as - or even better than - some of the teams the Ducks have faced so far.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
