To connect the outskirts of Belfast with Scotland\u2019s mainland, offering the world a symbol of his forward-thinking nation\u2019s economic vitality in the process.\n\nBoris Johnson has asked officials at the Department for Transport to produce a \u2018factual paper\u2019 on the feasibility of building a bridge across the Irish Sea\n\nThis grand feat of engineering, dubbed the \u2018Brexit Bridge\u2019, will span up to 28 miles and according to current estimates cost anything from \u00a315 billion to \u00a320 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s also an immense technical challenge. Critics, including one eminent engineer, have declared the chances of its proceeding without a hitch as \u2018about as fanciful as building a bridge to the Moon\u2019.\n\nAccording to leaked briefing papers obtained by Channel 4, civil servants have nonetheless been told that the PM wants a detailed run-down of \u2018the risks around the project\u2019 not to mention a few ideas about \u2018where this money would come from\u2019.\n\nIn a country which seems incapable of building any new railway line, airport runway or major road either on time or on budget, this extraordinary endeavour seems optimistic to say the least.\n\nAfter all, the most feasible of the two proposed routes must cross an often choppy stretch of water more than 1,000 ft deep.\n\nThe crossing would be adjacent to Beaufort\u2019s Dyke, a 900ft deep, 30-mile long trench which the Ministry of Defence previously used as a dumping ground for live munitions\n\nIt would require dozens of vast support towers, roughly 1,400ft tall, to be built, transported on site, and then dropped with great precision and fixed firmly into the sea bed.\n\nAdding to the perils, the crossing would be adjacent to Beaufort\u2019s Dyke, a 900ft deep, 30-mile long trench which the Ministry of Defence used as a dumping ground for live munitions between the end of World War I and the Seventies.\n\nMore than 1.5 million tons of explosives \u2014 along with devices containing mustard gas and the nerve agent Sarin \u2014 are thought to be decomposing on the sea floor there, along with radioactive waste from Britain\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. No complete map of their location exists.\n\nThe winds in the North Channel \u2014 the name for that part of the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Scotland \u2014 are notorious and can create threatening seas.\n\nIndeed one of Britain\u2019s worst sea disasters was here on January 31, 1953, when a British Rail ferry, the Princess Victoria, tried to make the crossing from Stranraer to Larne in raging winds.\n\nShe failed after the loading doors were stove in by huge seas and went down even as rescue boats tried to find her in atrocious conditions. A shocking 133 people died.\n\nSo can we be sure such a long bridge carrying high-sided lorries would survive such a storm?\n\nBoris isn\u2019t about to let such trifling questions derail the grand scheme, though.\n\n\u2018The Prime Minister has made no secret of his support for infrastructure projects that increase connectivity for people and particularly those that strengthen the Union,\u2019 was how a Downing Street spokesman put it this week.\n\nOne big reason for his support is, perhaps inevitably, Brexit.\n\nAccording to leaked briefing papers obtained by Channel 4, civil servants have nonetheless been told that the PM wants a detailed run-down of \u2018the risks around the project\u2019\n\nA bridge that physically connects Northern Ireland with the mainland has long been supported by Arlene Foster\u2019s DUP, who regard it as a bold physical symbol of the link between Ulster and the rest of the UK.\n\nCourting her party is, of course, crucial to Johnson\u2019s ability to extricate Britain from the EU: though currently in coalition with the Tories, its stringent opposition to the so-called Irish backstop helped condemn Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal to defeat in the House of Commons earlier this year.\n\nImportantly, the DUP reportedly believe that committing to build a bridge physically connecting the mainland with Northern Ireland might help solve the current impasse in Westminster by reducing the threat of a post-Brexit border across the Irish sea under any new deal \u2014 a fact that Johnson himself foresaw last year.\n\n\u2018What we need to do is build a bridge between our islands,\u2019 he declared, during an interview that was highly critical of Theresa May\u2019s leadership. \u2018Why don\u2019t we? Why don\u2019t we? There is so much more we can do, and what grieves me about the current approach to Brexit is that we are just in danger of not believing in ourselves, not believing in Britain.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, in Scotland, where polls suggest there is much general hostility to Boris Johnson in advance of a possible UK general election, the idea is also hugely popular.\n\nA bridge that physically connects Northern Ireland with the mainland has long been supported by Arlene Foster\u2019s DUP\n\nBoth of the proposed routes \u2014 either a 13-mile crossing from Torr Head in Northern Ireland to Scotland\u2019s Mull of Kintyre (itself a long way north from most of Britain), or the 28-mile span from Larne to Portpatrick \u2014 will after all provide a fillip to the country\u2019s somewhat moribund economy by strengthening trade with Ireland.\n\nPerhaps that explains why even the SNP, whose stock reaction to new Tory policy proposals is immediate outrage, are also vigorously backing it. The Scottish Government\u2019s constitutional relations secretary, Michael Russell, has called it a \u2018great idea\u2019.\n\nThe idea of creating a physical link between the UK and Ireland is nothing new, as it happens.\n\nAs far back as 1897, a group of businessmen from Belfast went to London to ask the British Government for \u00a315,000 towards the cost of assessing the feasibility of a tunnel. No cash was forthcoming, but various similar proposals have been knocking around ever since.\n\nMost recently, in the mid-2000s, engineering firm Symonds asked the Irish government to pay around \u00a310 million towards a study looking at a tunnel project. It concluded that any such endeavour was unlikely to generate enough revenue to recover its costs.\n\nThe proposal the current project is likely to be based on has been drawn up by Alan Dunlop, Visiting Professor of Architecture at Robert Gordon University and Liverpool University.\n\nHe believes it could fuel a \u2018Celtic powerhouse\u2019 by allowing traffic to avoid expensive, and slow, ferry routes to the mainland.\n\n\u2018One haulier I was speaking to was making dozens of trips across from Northern Ireland to Scotland every year and the cost of that was \u00a3600 each time,\u2019 he has said. \u2018So when you take personalised stories like this, you can see how the financial benefit would add up.\u2019\n\nOthers aren\u2019t so sure, though. Economist Dr Esmond Birnie of Ulster University, who has studied the economic impacts of a bridge, believes it would be unlikely to pay for itself in the long term.\n\n\u2018Even on the most generous assumptions it is unlikely that the total measurable economic benefits of such a bridge would come anywhere close to its very considerable cost,\u2019 he has argued.\n\nIn a country as divided as Northern Ireland, things are never entirely simple, though.\n\nWhile the DUP are keen on building links with the mainland, their rivals in the nationalist community are anything but, raising fears that a \u2018Brexit Bridge\u2019 would become an immediate terrorist target.\n\n2011 saw China open the Danyang\u2013Kunshan Grand Bridge, which takes rail traffic across an astonishing 102.4 miles\n\nYet the scheme\u2019s biggest issues are not economic but practical. While many longer bridges have been built in recent years \u2014 2011 saw China open the Danyang\u2013Kunshan Grand Bridge, which takes rail traffic across an astonishing 102.4 miles \u2014 none has covered such a deep and hostile stretch of water.\n\nThailand\u2019s 34-mile-long Bang Na expressway, the world\u2019s longest road bridge, was built across dry land, while Europe\u2019s current longest, the 10.7 mile Vasco da Gama, is in coastal waters near Lisbon. Its longest foundation piles go down a mere 311ft, roughly a third of the depth that would required to cross the Irish Sea.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, has form for ploughing public money into ill-fated bridges.\n\nAs Mayor of London, he became a vigorous proponent of actress Joanna Lumley\u2019s so-called Garden Bridge across the Thames, even making a secretive trip to San Francisco in 2013 in an effort to get Apple to sponsor it.\n\nCosts proceeded to spiral, while critics complained about the project being privately run yet publicly subsidised and argued that the scheme would become a costly white elephant.\n\nAmid growing warnings that the Garden Bridge was likely to dramatically exceed its \u00a3185 million budget, with further concerns about its procurement processes, the project was shelved by Johnson\u2019s successor, Sadiq Khan, in 2017. By then, the cost to taxpayers had reached an astonishing \u00a343 million, with nothing whatsoever to show for it.\n\nThat failed bridge would have spanned a grand total of 30 metres, across a tidal river. Johnson\u2019s \u2018Brexit Bridge\u2019 must, by contrast span roughly 45,000 metres of open sea \u2014 meaning that, on previous form, it\u2019s heading straight for troubled water.", "description": "The Prime Minister has asked officials at the Department for Transport to produce a 'factual paper' on the feasibility of building a bridge across the Irish Sea, writes GUY ADAMS.", "authors": ["Guy Adams For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/11/21/18365724-0-image-a-31_1568235541490.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
