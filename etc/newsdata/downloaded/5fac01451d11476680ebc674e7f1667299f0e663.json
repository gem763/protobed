We want to see action!\" the group wrote on Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nLONDON TO LISBON\n\nMore than 2 million people live in areas of London that have illegally high levels of air toxins, according to official data.\n\nTo change that, the city this year introduced the world's first Ultra Low Emission Zone, requiring all vehicles to meet strict standards or pay a fee to enter the centre, Khan said.\n\nOthers offered carrots instead of sticks.\n\nThe mayor of Lisbon, Fernando Medina, said the Portuguese capital launched a discounted single fare ticket in April that had already resulted in a 30% increase in public transport use.\n\nIt has also increased green spaces, he said, with the equivalent of some 200 football pitches newly planted.\n\nMilan's Mayor Giuseppe Sala said the Italian city was implementing a large low-emission zone and planned to completely switch its bus fleet to electric within seven years.\n\n\"Politically it is not easy to tell people they can't use their car but at this moment it is necessary,\" Sala told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on the sidelines of the conference.\n\nCities are vital to limit global warming as they account for about three-quarters of carbon emissions and consume more than two-thirds of global energy, according to the United Nations.\n\nKnown technologies such as electric buses could deliver more than half the cuts needed to keep global temperature rises below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the U.N. says.\n\n\"Bold and ambitious climate action has the added benefit of reducing harmful pollution and cleaning the air we breathe,\" said the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti.
