Sensenbrenner said in a statement that when he first began public service, \"I said I would know when it was time to step back\" and that he'd decided now was that time.\n\nTwo other House members also announced Wednesday they would not seek reelection next year: Bill Flores, Republican of Texas, and Susan Davis, Democrat of California.\n\nThe spate of House Republican retirements puts them ahead of their pace during the 2018 election cycle, when 34 did not run for re-election. That was the party's highest number of retirements since at least 1930.\n\nSensenbrenner's district, which includes parts of Milwaukee's suburbs, is considered safe Republican terrain. Even so, his departure adds to a parade of GOP lawmakers who will not be back, including at least four seats that Democrats have a legitimate shot at capturing, and will complicate Republican efforts to win back the chamber's majority.\n\nDemocrats control the House 235-197, with one independent and two vacancies in North Carolina that are scheduled to be filled in special elections next week.\n\nSensenbrenner was a chief author of the USA Patriot Act, an anti-terrorism measure enacted in response to the attacks of September 11, 2001. A combative conservative, he has championed immigration restrictions, including curbing asylum and barring immigrants in the country illegally from obtaining driver's licenses. In 2015, he wrote legislation restricting the Patriot Act by limiting federal gathering of some data on individuals.\n\nSensenbrenner is a descendent of the founder of Kimberly-Clark, the company credited with inventing the sanitary napkin. Financially comfortable since birth, he also won at least one District of Columbia lottery, for $250,000.\n\nIn his statement, Sensenbrenner said he's cast 23,882 House votes and sponsored or co-sponsored 4,299 pieces of legislation, of which 217 were signed into law by six different presidents.\n\nDavis' and Flores' districts are both considered safe for their parties.\n\nDavis, a 10-term veteran, has worked on education and military issues. She became the fourth Democrat to say this year that they won't run again in 2020.\n\nFlores, who once led the conservative Republican Study Committee, has served five terms and said he'd always committed to serving fewer than six.\n\nBesides the 15 GOP retirees, a 16th \u2014 Representative Tom Marino of Pennsylvania \u2014 quit Congress early this year and has already been replaced by another Republican.", "description": "The second-longest serving current member of the House became the 15th GOP lawmaker to announce he won't run for re-election in 2020.
