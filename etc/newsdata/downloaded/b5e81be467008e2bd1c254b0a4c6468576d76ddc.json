After Reines suggested that that a rematch between Hillary and Donald Trump would solve the purported problem Democrats face in their 2020 primary, Politico decided to check with her former colleagues on Capitol Hill. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d replied Joe Manchin, a position echoed by many other Senate Democrats \u2014 and on the record, too.\n\nFor instance, here\u2019s the #2-ranking Democrat in the upper chamber:\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s done a great service to our country and public service, and I supported her wholeheartedly, but I believe it\u2019s time for another nominee,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin.\n\nAnd a red-state Democrat:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be good for her,\u201d said Montana Sen. Jon Tester. \u201cShe\u2019s been through this war once. The Republicans have made a target out of her for 30 years and she\u2019s still going to [be] that same target. I just think it would be tough.\u201d\n\nWhat about the women in the Senate Democratic caucus? Don\u2019t they want to see Hillary vindicated? Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not high up on their priority list:\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of really fantastic candidates out there already. Let\u2019s leave it at that,\u201d said Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono. \u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know whether the world has passed on or not,\u201d said California Sen. Dianne Feinstein. \u201cI\u2019m a friend of hers and I\u2019m extraordinarily fond of her. But that\u2019s a factor.\u201d\n\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t account for all 47 Senate Democrats, but add in Richard Blumenthal, Martin Heinrich, Ben Cardin, and Doug Jones, and the consensus seems pretty clear. Politico didn\u2019t apparently reach out for comment to six of the Democrats who are running for the nomination themselves (Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Michael Bennet, and Bernie Sanders in name only), but their responses would be more or less a given.\n\nEspecially Sanders\u2019, one would imagine.\n\nAfter last cycle\u2019s dreadful attempt at a coronation and the damage it did to the DNC\u2019s credibility just to end up in a loss to Trump anyway, a lack of enthusiasm for Her Majesty is not unexpected. What does seem notable is how willing all of these Senate Democrats were to go on the record to dismiss Hillary. The Clinton Establishment must really be dead after its quarter-century run in the Democratic Party. That blunt dismissal from so many leading Democrats makes it very clear that the door is not only shut, it\u2019s locked, bolted, barricaded, and perhaps even set for an auto-destruct sequence if Reines and others keep trying to push Hillary through it in 2020.", "description": "\"I supported her wholeheartedly, but I believe it\u2019s time for another nominee.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/hillary-eyes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
