We liked the site and we knew it was expensive but we were very determined to make it work,\" said Little Lane co-founder Mike Wu.\n\nConstruction will begin in January, with plans to open in 2021. The centre will accommodate 380 children and 100 staff, offering double the amount of space per child required under planning laws.\n\nAdding in other costs associated with the purchase and plans to spend an extra $30 million on building and operations costs at Emerald Place, Mr Wu estimated a total of $100 million would be spent on the development.\n\nA play for parents\n\nLittle Lane co-founder Shan Kuo said the childcare facility would not just be reliant on families moving to the developing Fishermans Bend area. She said she foresaw parents from all over Melbourne who worked in the city flocking to the childcare centre.\n\n\"It just makes sense to have children in a facility near where they work if they're working in an inner-city area,\" Ms Kuo said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Little Lane founders own 17 centres nationally and plan to open two more by the end of the year.\n\nMs Kuo said a similar pattern appeared when Little Lane opened a centre in Brisbane.\n\n\"To start with it was a bit of challenge but once we got a reputation, people started coming from all over Brisbane,\" she said.\n\nIn September the childcare power couple announced they planned to raise $150 million in a sale-and-leaseback deal by selling seven of their other centres.\n\nMr Wu said they had received \"a couple\" of offers but could not comment further.", "description": "Kids will play among fruit trees and an artificial creek at Little Lane's latest childcare facility in Fishermans Bend.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4549%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_681%2C$y_389/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b1d5883321ff7bc7d2a75616b463a0b7c76419de", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
