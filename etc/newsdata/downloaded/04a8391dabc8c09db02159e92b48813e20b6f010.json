I did not think he\u2019d devote a seven-minute segment to it, replete with inviting back that guest, Joe diGenova, to double down on his attack on that contributor, Andrew Napolitano.\n\nGranted, that\u2019s what a good Trumpist should do in the era of Trump: Never let a slight pass without answer, especially a slight from a liberal. To do so would be redolent of cuckery. But I figured Fox executives would step in and either tell Tucker to drop it or to limit his response. Instead he all but accuses Shep in the clip below of being a left-wing hack. \u201cIt makes people cynical when you dress up news coverage, when you dress up partisanship as news coverage and pretend that your angry political opinions are news, you know, people tune out,\u201d says Carlson near the end of the clip \u2014 never mentioning Smith by name, just as Shep never named him in his own segment yesterday. Even though he replayed the footage of Smith\u2019s criticism during this same segment.\n\nThis Fox news/opinion civil war is going to be insane. Will Shep unload on Tucker on his own show today? I can sort of understand why management might be inclined to let them keep at it \u2014 I haven\u2019t been this interested in Fox programming in years. Imagine the ratings.\n\nA few points about the segment itself. At one point Tucker takes mild umbrage at Shep calling diGenova a partisan. I can see why \u2014 just because a lawyer takes a view of a legal matter that happens to align with his party\u2019s interests doesn\u2019t mean his view was distorted by partisanship. DiGenova, however, has been a sufficiently ardent and outspoken Trump defender in his Fox appearances that Trump tried to hire him as his attorney early last year. (Ultimately he declined due to potential conflicts of interest.) Accusing him of partisanship is a bit like accusing Laurence Tribe of Democratic partisanship because Tribe just so happens to take the anti-Trump position in all legal disputes involving the president. How unfair is it really?\n\nTucker also marvels at one point at how peeved Shep was at diGenova\u2019s criticism of Napolitano considering that the underlying legal question, whether Trump committed a campaign finance violation in his chat with Zelensky, is a matter of debate among experts. But \u2026 that was Shep\u2019s point exactly. It wasn\u2019t Napolitano who implied that the matter was a slam dunk; it was diGenova in his first segment with Carlson, when he called Napolitano a \u201cfool\u201d for believing that Trump might be guilty of something. Tucker and Joe are the ones behaving as though there\u2019s no good-faith position on the other side here, not Smith and Napolitano.\n\nAnd really, nothing about this segment answers Shep\u2019s most basic complaint: It\u2019s fine to disagree with Napolitano \u2014 again, the legal issue is debatable \u2014 but there\u2019s no need to disparage him on Fox\u2019s own airwaves by dismissing him as a \u201cfool.\u201d DiGenova actually disparages him again in this clip, insisting that Napolitano\u2019s criticism of Trump is a matter of personal pique at the president for not appointing him to the Supreme Court. It\u2019s a petty grudge, nothing more thoughtful than that. It *has* been reported that Napolitano thought he might be in line for a SCOTUS seat, however surreal that might seem, but Napolitano is also a devout libertarian of longstanding who\u2019s complained for years about the executive branch claiming powers that don\u2019t belong to it under the Constitution. It\u2019s possible that Napolitano has become a Trump critic because Trump\u2019s behavior has irritated that libertarian sensibility, not because he\u2019s mad at Trump for not giving him a job. If Tucker\u2019s so indignant at Shep for assuming a petty motive (partisanship) to explain diGenova\u2019s legal analysis, why would he let diGenova attribute a petty motive to Napolitano?\n\nT-minus three hours and 40 minutes until Shep\u2019s show as I write this.
