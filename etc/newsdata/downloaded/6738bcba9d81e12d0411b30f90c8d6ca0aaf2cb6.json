The Cowboys racked up 352 yards on the ground - thanks in part to a career performance by Chuba Hubbard - and 203 via the pass.\n\nHubbard\u2019s 221 yards and three touchdowns vaulted him into the national lead for rushing yards after the season\u2019s first week.\n\nOregon State was ranked 121st out of 129 for total defense, and 127th for rushing defense after the first game. It was a continuation of the struggles the Beavers had last season, when they gave up an overall average of 45.7 points and 536.8 yards per game - ranking them 128th in the nation.\n\nStill, it\u2019s just the first game, and Smith pointed to that fact this week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not overreacting to game one. This is the first game, after all that practice. Games are different. But we\u2019re not underreacting, either,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on the details and urgency to improve.\u201d\n\nOne point of emphasis for Smith was the Beavers\u2019 need to stop opponents on third down. The Cowboys converted 10 of 13 third downs.\n\n\u201cWe made the point on third down - and that did show up watching the tape - we\u2019ve got to do better on third down. But we did put them into situations on third downs that we\u2019ve just got to execute better,\u201d he said.\n\nOregon State\u2019s defense forced no turnovers. Jaydon Grant had the team\u2019s only sack although there appeared to be several more chances. But the Beavers did show some improvement with nine tackles for loss.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating. I mean, we worked so hard during fall camp, during winter conditioning,\u201d said inside linebacker Shemar Smith. \u201cWe still had progress, some flashes in the game. We just have to do it every time to come out with the outcome that we want.\u201d\n\nAnd granted, Oklahoma State\u2019s offense was solid in the opener. Hubbard, who showed flashes of what he could do last season, was particularly effective.\n\nHubbard was charitable toward Oregon State\u2019s defense afterward.\n\n\u201cThose guys definitely played with heart. Obviously, it\u2019s a first game, you\u2019re gonna make some mistakes. As an offense, we were rolling. Offensive line was moving guys. They did a great job there. I\u2019m not gonna knock on their defense, They played hard,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cI know they\u2019ll definitely have a better season than last year.\u201d\n\nOffensively, the Beavers fared well. Isaiah Hodgins caught nine passes for 170 yards and two touchdowns. Quarterback Jake Luton threw for 251 yards and three scores. Smith\u2019s only issue afterward was getting the ground game going.\n\nHawaii, Oregon State\u2019s opponent on Saturday, presents an entirely different challenge with its run-and-shoot offense. The Rainbow Warriors had a bye last weekend after a zero week 45-38 upset of Arizona.\n\nCedric Byrd II caught 14 passes for 224 yards against the Wildcats. Quarterback Cole McDonald threw for 378 yards and four touchdowns but he threw four interceptions, too, and didn\u2019t play the second half.\n\n\u201cThese guys play good at home. They\u2019re coming off a great win against Arizona, and then a bye week, so we\u2019ve got our work set out for us, which I know our guys will be excited about,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou want to play against challenges, and so we\u2019re looking forward to this challenge.\u201d\n\nOutside linebacker Addison Gumbs said after the opener that he wasn\u2019t discouraged.\n\n\u201cI still feel like we\u2019re a good defense. We didn\u2019t come out and show it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I still believe in the guys in this locker room and I think we\u2019ll come out and bounce back next week against Hawaii.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "One of the things Oregon State coach Jonathan Smith said he wanted to improve in his second season with the Beavers was the defense.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
