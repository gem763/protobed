Everything the UK Prime Minister said had already been reported in the media. He proposes to ditch Theresa May\u2019s contentious \u201cbackstop\u201d arrangement for the Irish border and intends to replace it with a regulatory border in the Irish Sea. This would effectively split Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, as the former would stay in the European single market for goods but leave the customs union.\n\n'A plan designed to fail and provide no serious proposals', said the opposition parties in the House. Under the new proposal, they argued, why can Northern Ireland stay in the single market and not Scotland? It seems very likely that the deal will be rejected by parliament as there isn\u2019t enough support from hard-line Eurosceptics. So, the PM will be forced to seek an extension to Brexit, even though he has threatened to break the law and force a no-deal exit. Time is ticking. The uncertainty continues.\n\nThe GBP/USD\u2019s price action is mirroring the political uncertainty hanging over the markets. Over the past four days (today included), the cable has displayed as many doji candles on the daily chart. These candles are formed when the opening and closing prices are roughly equal, with wicks in either direction \u2013 suggesting that neither the bulls nor the bears are in full control of price action.\n\nThe current indecisiveness suggests a sizeable move is upon us once either the bulls or bears are defeated. Overall, I am leaning slightly towards the bullish side given the reaction of the this week. So, I would not be surprised if the cable were to rise from here and stage a short squeeze rally \u2013 despite the ongoing Brexit uncertainty.\n\nGBP/USD Daily Chart\n\nDisclaimer: The information on this web site is not targeted at the general public of any particular country.
