The Nasdaq Composite was up 71.85 points, or 0.91%, at 7,975.59.\n\nAmong other stocks, Delta Air Lines Inc fell 3.5%, the most on the S&P 500, after the carrier forecast disappointing current-quarter profit.\n\nCisco Systems Inc dropped 2%, after a report that Goldman Sachs downgraded the network gear maker's shares to \"neutral\".\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 2.20-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.96-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded four new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 10 new highs and 71 new lows.
