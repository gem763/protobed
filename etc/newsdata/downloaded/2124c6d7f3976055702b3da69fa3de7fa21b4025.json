Recession risk remains low for now, but today\u2019s update also reaffirms that a rebound in growth is unlikely any time soon.\n\nUS Real GDP Change\n\nThe median nowcast is currently anticipating a 2.0% increase in U.S. output for Q3, based on several models compiled by The Capital Spectator. This median matches the 2.0% gain previously reported for Q2. The official Q3 GDP report \u2013 the \u201cadvance\u201d estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis \u2014 is scheduled for release on Oct. 30.\n\nToday\u2019s median update reflects a slightly softer nowcast vs. The Capital Spectator\u2019s previous Q3 estimate of 2.2%, published on Sep. 24.\n\nRecent survey data, however, has painted a darkening picture of US economic activity \u2013 the ISM Manufacturing Index reflected contraction for a second month in September.\n\nNote, too, that the IHS Markit Composite Index \u2013 a survey based indicator that incorporates manufacturing and services data and is used as GDP proxy \u2013 points to a sluggish trend.\n\nComposite Output Index\n\n\u201cThe surveys are consistent with the economy growing at a 1.5% annualized rate in the third quarter, with forward-looking indicators suggesting further momentum could be lost in the fourth quarter,\u201d says Chris Williamson, chief business economist at HIS Markit, in a report published last week.\n\nBut some analysts say that the hard data, reflecting formal economic reports, offer a more encouraging profile. \u201cWhile the survey data have been steadily disappointing expectations, hard data have been a source of positive surprises,\u201d advises Doug Peta, chief U.S. investment strategist at BCA Research, in a note to clients. \u201cThe labor market remains vibrant enough to exert downward pressure on the unemployment rate, and services continue to expand despite the contraction in manufacturing, both here and abroad. The expansion has slowed, but it\u2019s not finished yet.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, but it\u2019s premature to completely dismiss the headwinds. A survey of economists published this week predicts that U.S. growth will fall below 2% next year \u2013 marking the slowest trend in three years. \u201cThe rise in protectionism, pervasive trade policy uncertainty, and slower global growth are considered key downside risks,\u201d says Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics and survey chair for National Association for Business Economics.\n\nA lot can happen between now and 2020, of course, and so all the usual caveats apply. Meantime, looking at the outlook for the GDP trend through a year-over-year lens suggests that economic growth will stabilize in the immediate future. The annual change in output is expected to hold at roughly the 2% mark for the near term, based on The Capital Spectator\u2019s average estimate via a set of combination forecasts.\n\nReal GDP 1 Yr % Changes\n\nBut as a casual review of recent headlines reminds, several potentially crucial risks continue to lurk, including the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and impeachment risk. Exactly how these and other factors unfold is unknown, but this much is clear: the road ahead is unusually cloudy. Based on the numbers published to date, however, there\u2019s still a reasonable argument for expecting that modest U.S. growth will endure for the foreseeable future.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by James Picerno covering: .
