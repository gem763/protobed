The initial suit, filed in U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York, sought more than $150 million in damages.\n\nPeloton, which is planning to debut on the Nasdaq Stock Market in the coming weeks, sells stationary bicycles and more recently treadmills for in-home use. Customers pay about $39 a month to stream classes the company produces using its own instructors on those machines, or about $20 a month for a digital subscription to cycling, running, boot-camp, yoga and other classes.\n\nPeloton countersued in April, alleging those publishers\u2014which include Downtown Music Publishing, Pulse Music Publishing, Ole and Peermusic \u2014and the NMPA engaged in anticompetitive behavior by banding together to extract unfair licensing terms for music.\n\nIn a letter to U.S. District Judge Denise L. Cote on Thursday, the publishers asked for permission to amend the complaint in their suit. They said they had found 1,300 more songs that had been used allegedly without permission, including ones recorded by Taylor Swift, Adele, Beyonc\u00e9, Bruno Mars, Ariana Grande, Britney Spears, Lizzo and Maroon 5.\n\nNewly discovered works include Ray Charles \u2019s \u201cGeorgia On My Mind,\u201d The Who\u2019s \u201cI Can See For Miles\u201d and The Beatles\u2019 \u201cI Saw Her Standing There.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeloton\u2019s customers pay for customized workout entertainment and Peloton\u2019s popularity depends on the accessibility of music on its platform,\u201d said NMPA Chief Executive David Israelite.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Peloton said the publishers had filed exaggerated claims on the eve of court-ordered mediation and timed the filing to capitalize on Peloton\u2019s inability to publicly respond in detail during the company\u2019s pre-IPO quiet period.\n\nIt said its proprietary music platform was developed with the collaboration of partners, which include all the major labels, major music publishers and performance-rights organizations.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to defend ourselves against claims made in this matter and look forward to pursuing our counterclaims,\u201d the company said.", "description": "A group of music publishers alleges Peloton\u2019s workout video-streaming service used more than twice as many songs without permission as they had previously claimed, and they are seeking more than $300 million in damages.", "authors": ["Anne Steele", "Anne.Steele Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107185/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
