Meanwhile, many young professionals are being put off from working in the industry. As Rebecca reported:\n\nYoung people working in wealth tell Business Insider that the allure of lucrative fields like tech, the daunting challenge of drumming up business as a newbie, and lingering unease with the industry for those who came of age during the financial crisis help explain why the jobs may have seemed less appealing.\n\nThat comes as many big financial firms look to wealth management as a big business opportunity. Morgan Stanley's bet on winning over unicorn-startup employees is starting to pay off, for example.\n\nThese clients promise the potential of steady earnings over generations, as wealthy parents pass on their wealth to their offspring. Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman said Thursday that its massive wealth management business is \"clearly stabilizing the firm.\"\n\nMerrill Lynch has responded to this generational gap by shifting how it handles staff who drop out of its financial-adviser trainee program. Those who exit its trainee program are now often transitioning to other roles within the firm instead of leaving altogether, according to Andy Sieg, the president of Merrill Lynch wealth management.\n\nIt's also paying more: Business Insider was first to report that Merrill Lynch hiked trainee financial advisers' starting salaries by $10,000 earlier this year as it looked to attract new talent.\n\nOn the flipside, Wells Fargo said this week that retirements drove its financial adviser headcount lower in the third quarter, and it expects to see more retirements as it uses incentives to encourage younger advisers to take over clients.\n\nAdviser demographics are \"one of the realities of the wealth management industry that has not received a lot of attention,\" Sieg previously told Business Insider, and firms need tackle how to position the next generation.\n\nSamantha Lee/Business Insider\n\nThe inside story\n\nOur mission at Business Insider is pretty simple: to live up to our name and go inside the most interesting and dynamic businesses in the world.
