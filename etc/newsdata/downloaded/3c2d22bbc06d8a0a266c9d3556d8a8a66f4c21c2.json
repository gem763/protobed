It features experienced management and an excellent record of tracking its index. It is a fine option in its niche, earning a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Silver.\n\nUntil early February 2018, the fund tracked the MSCI US REIT Index, which holds domestic-equity REITs, or firms that manage properties and collect rent. That index doesn't include mortgage REITs, which invest in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities rather than actual properties, nor does it include non-real-estate specialty REITs, such as timber or cell-tower REITs.", "description": "A low fee and broad diversification make this fund a top choice.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/bltae44f6bf21212646/5c76b9bb14828807488f6b86/BenJohnson_1x1.jpg"}
