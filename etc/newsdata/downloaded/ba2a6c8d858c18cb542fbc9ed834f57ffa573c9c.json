To call this a feisty draw with Crystal Palace would be doing a major disservice to the sheer number of incidents on an afternoon when the connection between the Arsenal team and their supporters appeared more frayed than at any point in Unai Emery\u2019s reign.\n\nThe lingering image of this match will be the sight of a furious Granit Xhaka swearing at his own supporters and marching down the tunnel, his shirt abandoned on the floor behind him. The home crowd turned on the club captain and then called en masse for Mesut Ozil, the exiled playmaker who cannot even make the substitutes\u2019 bench.\n\nFor months to come, the mention of Palace will conjure up images of VAR reviews and missed opportunities in Emery\u2019s mind. He now has a major problem to solve with Xhaka, and he made clear afterwards that he also has a major problem with the video technology after his side were denied a late winner which would have gone some way towards rebuilding the atmosphere around the club.\n\nAll this is before Emery even considers the way his team surrendered a two-goal lead, seized after just nine minutes, and allowed Palace to turn this match into the unruly scrap they wanted.", "description": "A day of chaos, controversy and mutiny at the Emirates, where Arsenal\u2019s frenetic start to the season continued in the most extraordinary fashion.", "authors": ["Sam Dean", "Chris Bascombe", "Keith Hackett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000214337406-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqP-t--XiuvYMJPd4Ncdgt2l4f0Cz7thBsRaa17oqZtNM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
