His nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party\u2019s base is more TV-watchers than Instagrammers.\n\nNevertheless, less than two weeks before the October 13 election, Poland's opposition parties have failed to keep up with the ruling party\u2019s online campaign, say critics.\n\nOpposition parties \u2014 including the largest, Civic Coalition \u2014 appear to have learned little from their stinging 2015 defeat, when PiS\u2019s sophisticated online campaign helped sweep the then-longshot nationalist party to power.\n\n\u201cPiS is unfortunately the only modern party in Poland right now,\u201d one official close to the opposition parties told POLITICO.\n\nPiS\u2019 internet prowess is largely credited to Pawe\u0142 Szefernaker, now a senior official at the interior ministry, who was still in his 20s when the party leadership handed him the keys to its online operation in 2015.\n\nOpposition parties appear to have learned little from their stinging 2015 defeat, when PiS\u2019s sophisticated online campaign helped sweep the then-longshot nationalist party to power.\n\nNow 32, he believes PiS is still enjoying a classic tech advantage: being the first mover.\n\n\u201cBack in 2015, politicians relied on the traditional forms of contact with their voters, such as videoclips and billboards,\u201d said Szefernaker. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really appreciate the role the internet could play in the campaign.\u201d\n\nSzefernaker convinced PiS\u2019s campaign strategists to let him send presidential candidate Andrzej Duda careening down a ski slope wearing a GoPro camera. He also filmed a good-humored Duda reading nasty tweets about himself, in the style of U.S. President Barack Obama.\n\nThe digital efforts got traction and continued after the election. Following PiS\u2019s shock victory, Duda would become the first head of state to stream a Q&A session on Facebook Live. PiS was also ahead of the curve in using Twitter in Poland, saturating the platform \u201cimmensely\u201d in 2015, said Anna Mierzy\u0144ska, a Polish online marketing consultant.\n\nDigital skillz\n\nRados\u0142aw Fogiel, who oversees the party\u2019s 2019 online strategy, said PiS hasn\u2019t enjoyed the same element of surprise this year, but has changed tactics accordingly.\n\nIn July, hours before the Civic Coalition announced its policy manifesto, PiS put up a fake website called Forumprogramoweko.pl, fooling voters and search engines seeking information about the party\u2019s real policy positions. Clicking on issues like \u201ceducation\u201d or \u201cforeign policy\u201d led voters not to Civic Coalition\u2019s campaign statements, but to pages of gaffes by the party\u2019s politicians.\n\nThe site remains active.\n\nFogiel is aware that PiS's base of older and more conservative voters is not a natural fit for digital politics, and that the opposition is working to close the digital gap.\n\n\u201cSometimes we joke in the team that if Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski were to set up a Twitter account, it would be the most momentous event in Polish politics since 1989,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our competitors have also done their homework.\u201d\n\nAnalysts agree the opposition is catching up to the ruling party\u2019s online machine in some areas \u2014 but too slowly.\n\n\u201cPiS is still outdoing them,\u201d said Joanna Sawicka, an analyst at Polityka Insight, a think tank. \u201cBut at least they started to do something.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes we joke in the team that if Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski were to set up a Twitter account, it would be the most momentous event in Polish politics since 1989\" \u2014 PiS online strategist Rados\u0142aw Fogiel\n\nCivic Coalition\u2019s \u201chashtags get good quantitative results, but it didn\u2019t really get out of their bubble\u201d of the party's electoral base, Mierzy\u0144ska said. \u201cTheir campaign has the outreach, but it doesn\u2019t translate to electoral results.\u201d\n\nSawicka believes PiS\u2019s leadership has won the organizational battle so far, granting younger strategists like Szefernaker and Fogiel key responsibilities. Opposition campaigns stick with veterans, even in defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing that campaigns lose, and the same people are in charge,\u201d she said.\n\nCivic Coalition is spending more money on digital advertising than any other party \u2014 more than 68,000 z\u0142oty (\u20ac15,800), or four times PiS\u2019s 17,000 z\u0142oty, in the first week of September, according to Facebook data But it\u2019s PiS that has so far shown more success in converting its money into votes, not just clicks.\n\n\u201cPiS wins a lot of their supporters online,\u201d said Mierzy\u0144ska. \u201cIts politicians spend a lot of time building relationships on the internet.\u201d\n\nAccording to 57 percent of Poles, PiS is running the best electoral campaign, a survey by IBRIS, a Warsaw polling firm, found last week. Only 4.8 percent preferred Civic Coalition\u2019s campaign.\n\nDirty tricks, or just tricks?\n\nThough most observers agree PiS has played a smarter online game, accusations of deception \u2014 and perhaps violations of online platforms\u2019 terms of use \u2014 have been flung by both sides.\n\nA 2017 analysis by Oxford University\u2019s Computational Research Project found right-wing bot accounts were twice as active in Polish social media as left-wing ones during the 2015 vote. The study also claimed the Polish right had deployed false social media accounts in 2015, nicknamed \u201cSzefernaker\u2019s Eggs\u201d for the young PiS digital campaign chief.\n\nThe report was inconclusive, however, on the degree of influence digital manipulation played in 2015. \u201cThere is a great deal of speculation as to how these sorts of operations work,\u201d it said. \u201cRelatively little is known about these techniques in practice.\u201d\n\nThis August, Deputy Justice Minister \u0141ukasz Piebiak resigned after Polish news website Onet alleged he had \u201carranged and controlled\u201d an online campaign against judges critical of a PiS-backed judicial reform. Piebiak had contracted an internet troll, known only as \u201cEmilia,\u201d to target an opposition judge online, sending more than 2,000 messages containing false accusations and personal details, the report claimed.\n\n\u201cPiS wins a lot of their supporters online. Its politicians spend a lot of time building relationships on the internet\" \u2014 online marketing consultant Anna Mierzy\u0144ska\n\nBoth sides have leveled accusations of trolling, however. Last week, right-wing magazine Sieci accused Civic Platform, the lead party in the Civic Coalition, of running Sok z Buraka, an anti-PiS Facebook page. The report said it employed hate speech and personal attacks against the government, and had 800,000 followers.\n\nSpeaking for the government side, Szefernaker denies PiS has engaged in digital manipulation. \u201cNo such actions, linked to bots and trolls, were carried out by PiS,\u201d he said. He claimed it simply didn\u2019t work, so PiS didn\u2019t do it. \u201cOn the internet, this sort of activity is not effective,\u201d because \u201cinternet users can immediately feel it\u2019s fake,\u201d he said.\n\nOther critics question how large a role digital campaigns play in Poland at all. Traditional retail politics and generous government subsidies is what drives votes. \u201cPiS gives people the impression that they\u2019ve never lived better,\u201d said \u0141ukasz M\u0119\u017cyk, editor of 300Polityka, a daily news monitoring website.\n\n\"They feel safe, there\u2019s no unemployment, they have extra money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you perfectly use Twitter or Facebook.\u201d", "description": "Opposition politicians are struggling to match PiS\u2019s digital game.", "authors": ["Zosia Wanat", "Jan Cienski"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/poland_social240x155-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
