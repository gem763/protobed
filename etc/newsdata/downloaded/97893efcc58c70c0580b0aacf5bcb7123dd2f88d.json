We're not friends, nor will we be, but the national team is the most important thing.'\n\nBravo and Barcelona star Vidal, who both have over 100 Chile caps, are long-term team-mates but their bond has now entirely deteriorated.\n\n'I have said things [to Bravo] and I don't have any reason to say them in the press,' Vidal continued. 'I am man enough to say things face to face. I don't know if he understood what I said, but we haven't spoken again since then.'\n\nChile drew 0-0 with Colombia in an October friendly before beating Guinea 3-2. Vidal and Bravo started together in both matches.\n\nSouth American qualifying for the 2020 World Cup is due to begin in March of next year. Chile have friendlies against Bolivia and Peru to come before then, next month.\n\nVidal says the pair, pictured during the Confederations Cup in 2017, will never be friends but will remain professional while on international duty\n\nVidal also revealed he isn't happy at Barcelona and hinted at a move to Inter Milan\n\nVidal also admitted he 'isn't happy' at Barcelona after falling down the pecking order at Camp Nou and discussed reports regarding a potential move to Inter.\n\nHe has started just two matches for Barcelona this season.\n\n'I am not happy, I am not happy,' he said. 'All my career I have started and this time it hasn't happened. I am calm, I am working to turn it over and win the position. I know it will come.\n\nHe added: 'I lived very nice moments with Antonio Conte. The quality leap I gave was thanks to him. In football the most important thing is trust and when a coach of that prestige gives it to you, you improve a lot.'", "description": "Barcelona midfielder Arturo Vidal has lifted the lid on his ongoing feud with Chile team-mate Claudio Bravo after revealing the pair aren't friends and don't speak on international duty.", "authors": ["Alec Fenn For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/11/20371000-0-image-a-40_1572434009631.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
