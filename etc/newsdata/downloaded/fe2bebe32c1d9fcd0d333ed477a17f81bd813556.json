But the astounding images from the annual Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition, which is developed and produced by the Natural History Museum in London, throw into sharp relief the brutality of predator-prey interactions and the resilience of species around the world.\n\nThis year, photographers traipsed through the Amazonian jungles of Peru, dove deep into the waters of French Polynesia, and stalked isolated ice floes in Antarctica to capture images of animals' struggles to survive and get a decent meal.\n\nPicture takers from 100 countries submitted 48,000 entries for the contest, including photos of a leopard seal lunging for a penguin, a male hippo crushing a newborn in its jaws, and a sea turtle strangled by a rope.\n\nHere are 14 of the \"highly commended\" front-runners in this year's contest. The overall winners will be announced on October 15.", "description": "The front-runners in the 2019 Wildlife Photographer of the Year contest showcase human-animal interactions and animals' struggles to get a decent meal.", "authors": ["Aylin Woodward"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7950792e22af03e474993b-2560-1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
