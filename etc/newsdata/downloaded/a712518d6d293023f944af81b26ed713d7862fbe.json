That would mean the introduction of new customs checks between the North and the Republic.\n\nBut Johnson says a hard border on the Irish island can be avoided by using technology so checks can be conducted far from the physical border.\n\nAll sides are anxious to avoid a hard border because of fears that it might reignite sectarian violence between those who want Northern Ireland to join the Republic and those who want to remain in the UK.\n\nAfter telephone talks with Varadkar, EU's Tusk expressed similar skepticism about Johnson's proposals.\n\nTusk said that the EU stands \"fully behind Ireland\". In sharp contrast, he coined his message to Johnson as \"we remain open, but still unconvinced\".\n\nThe BBC reported that Varadkar had said the proposal \"did not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop\", which is the EU's suggested mechanism to avoid a hard border by essentially committing the whole of the UK to follow EU rules until the two parties can agree on a free-trade deal.\n\nThe UK's opposition Labour Party and several other smaller opposition parties have already said it is unworkable.\n\nDespite Johnson's firm commitment to leave the EU by Oct 31, British lawmakers have passed cross-party legislation calling for him to gain their approval of any Brexit deal before Oct 19 or ask the EU to delay the exit date.\n\nJohnson told members of Parliament on Thursday that his proposals are a \"broad landing zone\" on which the UK and the EU can base future talks. Despite the two sides being \"still some way from a resolution\", he said hopes to see \"rapid negotiations\", so an agreement can be approved by the bloc at the EU-UK summit on Oct 17.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, said Johnson's proposal is a \"rehashed version\" of the one put forward by Theresa May.\n\n\"These proposals would lead to an even worse deal than the one put forward by the previous government,\" he told MPs. \" ...These plans are simply unworkable.\"\n\nThe Guardian newspaper reported that John McDonnell, the Labour Party's shadow chancellor, had said: \"Any responsible prime minister would have spent the past three months trying to build a consensus in Parliament and across the European Union in order to break the deadlock. However, Boris Johnson has neither the intention nor ability to negotiate a deal or protect jobs and communities across the United Kingdom.\"", "description": "European Union leaders have given a lukewarm response to the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's latest proposals for a Brexit withdrawal deal that would detail their relationship after the United Kingdom leaves the bloc.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/05/5d97fa84a310cf3e979fd418.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
