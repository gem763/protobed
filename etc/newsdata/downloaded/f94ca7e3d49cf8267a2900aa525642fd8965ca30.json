Hodgson approved, shaking a fist in celebration.\n\nFahrmann\u2019s attempt to stop the penalty was his last action of the match as he was substituted and limped off. Third-choice goalkeeper Michael McGovern, 35, replaced him, making his Premier League debut - and first league appearance since April 2017.\n\nStory continues\n\nNorwich threatened as half-time approached as Teemu Pukki and Emi Buendia both had shots saved - with Todd Cantwell also having a strike blocked by centre-back Martin Kelly.\n\nPalace had been sitting on their lead, but there was a more positive start to the second half from the home side, with McArthur and Patrick van Aanholt shooting over.\n\nNorwich also began struggling to deal with Palace corners, as the pressure carried on.\n\nZaha headed another chance over late on but, unlike in the previous home game, they were not made to pay for their missed opportunities - and did the opposite by having the last word.\n\nSubstitute Andros Townsend killed the game off, squeezing the ball home after being teed up Zaha.", "description": "Norwich\u2019s alarming away form continued as they slumped to a fourth defeat out of four on their travels in the Premier League, following goals by Luka Milivojevic and Andros Townsend.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/s1syiFxGUALl5wKeHsLaqw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Dn5EBiUHLeDxBAItuBq6TA--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/fc67a15e20299fdf5141b043e7470199", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
