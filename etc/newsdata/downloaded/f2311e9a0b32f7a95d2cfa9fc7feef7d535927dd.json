The organisation said it had set up an \u201cemergency room\u201d to deal with the spike in arrests, and that at least 100 more people were likely to have been detained after protests in Suez, Alexandria and Giza. Another NGO, the Egyptian Centre for Economic & Social Rights, stated it had recorded at least 274 arrests since the demonstrations began.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to get cases around the clock,\u201d said Mohamed Lotfy of ECRF. \u201cI think the riot police and the ministry of the interior didn\u2019t expect this size of protests.\u201d ECRF recorded arrests in at least 12 locations, including Cairo, Giza, Alexandria, Suez, and towns such as Dakahlia, Qalyubia and Kafr el-Sheikh.\n\nProtesters and police clash in Egypt for second day running Read more\n\nOn Friday protesters had taken to the streets across Egypt for the first time in years, in defiance of a de facto six-year ban on demonstrations. Those who came out to call openly for an end to Sisi\u2019s rule risked immediate arrest as well as the use of teargas, rubber bullets and live rounds.\n\n\u201cThe Friday protest was such a shock to me because people were not able to voice any of their anger. So this was a sign of hope that people still have a voice, they\u2019re not dead. I feel encouraged to protest next Friday, the same as many others,\u201d said 32-year-old Hafsa, a teacher who protested in Cairo\u2019s el-Matareya district on Friday.\n\n\u201cNow in Matareya, there\u2019s a heavy police presence with riot police at the entrance to all main streets. There are also plainclothes policemen who search people at random. 24/7 there are mobile patrols roaming the streets to intimidate people,\u201d she said.\n\nRiot police and security forces surrounded Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square on Saturday evening, to prevent potential demonstrators accessing the symbolic site. But in the north-eastern city of Suez, crowds of protesters chanted against the president before being broken up by a wave of teargas, live rounds and arrests.\n\nArrest data shows that protesters were either too young to fully partake in the 2011 uprising that overthrew Hosni Mubarak, or are part of an older generation less accustomed to demonstrations. \u201cIt\u2019s the average Egyptian who has never protested in the past, perhaps they joined the millions in Tahrir when they were younger,\u201d said Lotfy. \u201cBut if you look at the list, many are in their 20s. This feels like a new generation of protesters.\u201d\n\nTimeline After Tahrir Square Show Hide Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak steps down after almost 30 years in power amid anti-government Arab spring protests. Rallies continue all year. Islamist parties win drawn-out parliamentary elections. Mohamed Morsi of Muslim Brotherhood wins presidential election. Mubarak sentenced to life in prison for complicity in killing 800 protesters in 2011. Army overthrows Morsi. Security forces kill hundreds in pro-Morsi camp. Former army chief Abdel Fatah al-Sisi wins presidential election. Morsi sentenced to death. Egypt's appeal court orders retrial in 2016. Isis claims responsibility for bombing Russian plane in Sinai. Crew and 224 tourists killed. IMF approves three-year $12bn loan to Egypt designed to help country out of economic crisis. Suicide bombers kill dozens at two churches as worshippers celebrate Palm Sunday. Egyptian airstrikes on northern Sinai after militants assault on a mosque kills 305 people. Sisi announces he will run for a second term.\n\nThose documenting events were also targeted for arrest. A man named Mohamed Saied who filmed protests in Suez and posted footage to social media recorded an emotional message Saturday night. \u201cThe police are downstairs from my building, they\u2019re coming to arrest me,\u201d he says. \u201cAll I did was film.\u201d\n\nThe number of arrests in Cairo on Saturday overwhelmed the capacity of all nearby police stations, with detainees being housed in a barracks meant for Egypt\u2019s central security forces. From there, detainees are taken in groups for questioning by the police as well as Egypt\u2019s national security agency, both known for their use of \u201csystematic, widespread enforced disappearances and torture that most likely amount to crimes against humanity\u201d, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nBut there has been little official response to the protests. Egypt\u2019s State Information Service released a statement targeting Cairo-based international journalists on Saturday evening, warning them to \u201cabide by internationally recognised professional standards\u201d, in covering the protests.\n\n\u201cMany world capitals witness daily incidents without anyone jumping to conclusions or exaggerations that are usually not even remotely close to the truth,\u201d it said. The presidential spokesman Bassam Rady was not reachable when contacted by the Guardian.\n\nThe call for this weekend\u2019s protests came from Mohamed Ali, a former military contractor and actor who released a string of videos accusing Sisi and the military of high-level corruption. His accusations were previously dismissed as \u201clies and slander\u201d, by the Egyptian leader. Ali has since called for a \u201cmillion-man\u201d march this Friday.\n\nProtests looked set to continue with Sisi on a trip to New York where he was due to give a speech on \u201cpreserving world peace and security as well as fighting terrorism\u201d at the UN general assembly. His absence underlines a dilemma facing Egyptian security forces at home, who are under pressure to contain demonstrators without using excessive force.\n\n\u201cProtests are likely to continue if the government failed to devise an appropriate \u2018political\u2019 response. Confusion and inconsistency inflame protests rather than contain them,\u201d said the political analyst Nael Shama. \u201cShrewd authoritarian leaders survive when they choose the right mix of repression and concession.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis movement is not run by high-ranking politicians or activists. It\u2019s normal people protesting,\u201d said Assem, a 35-year-old lawyer from Alexandria.\n\n\u201cMohamed Ali is not a hero but he got people talking and getting angry. I will participate in whatever protests occur, but I will be careful because the level of police response last Friday was suspicious. Anything is possible, and who knows what might take place.\u201d", "description": "Younger generation takes to the streets in defiance of six-year ban on demonstrations", "authors": ["Ruth Michaelson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76b0891ed692bc1f5b11e53e7fd747754e1fd808/50_0_2933_1759/master/2933.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0b4af25a7967de32a49a755da4f93a89", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
