He's also been offered the chance to star in an American movie - though he turned it down for footballing reasons.\n\nHowever, while his life may now seem glamorous, it's not always been plain sailing for the big man.\n\nAfter leaving Watford, England, as a teenager in 2001, Akinfenwa signed with Lithuanian side FK Atlantas, a move his agent organised through his connections at the club. The move was supposed to be a platform for Akinfenwa to showcase his talents. Instead, he spent the season being racially abused at the hands of the club's fans.\n\n\"It's hard. I went through it at 18,\" Akinfenwa told Business Insider during a meet at the FIFA 20 launch event in Greenwich on Wednesday. \"Mine was in an Eastern European country. And it was severe.\"\n\nHe told The Guardian that he endured everything from monkey chants, to being called \"a n-----.\" But rather than succumb to the abuse and leave Lithuania, Akinfenwa stayed, and faced the problem Beast Mode style, eventually going on to become a fan favourite, as well as open his own Adidas store in the city of Klaipeda.\n\nWhile it's still not a time he remembers fondly, Akinfenwa now believes the experience means he can help other players suffering the same, as well as from mental health problems that can accompany such abuse through the vector of his new charity Beast Mode State of Mind, which is set to open in 2020.\n\n\"We're doing a charity where it's about embracing who you are, not worrying about the stereotypes, not worrying about the pressures of society or what people think you should be,\" Akinfenwa told Business Insider.\n\nHe added: \"For me, you've got to be comfortable. You've got to be comfortable in yourself. So if somebody's coming out and they're talking about your weight, your colour, you've got to be comfortable in yourself. Don't let them depict you in that way.\"\n\nRacial abuse in soccer has been highly prevalent in the news in recent weeks.\n\nChelsea striker Tammy Abraham was targeted on Twitter by attackers who called him a \"black c---\", and a \"f------ n-----,\" after he missed a penalty in the Europa Super League final.\n\nManchester United duo Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba were also targeted following their side's 1-1 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nThere have been others too - Romelu Lukaku, Yakou Meite, and Raheem Sterling are just a few who have spoken about the abuse they've suffered in recent weeks at the hands of fans all across the world.\n\nWhile his charity might not be open just yet, Akinfenwa still has advice for those going through what he once did as a teenager in Lithuania.\n\n\"My advice would be that, firstly, remember it's ignorance,\" he said. \"So perhaps they need to be educated. And also that talking helps. Do not feel like you need to put in on your shoulders. And do not feel like talking about it makes you any less of a man.\n\n\"It's not a problem that's going to get dealt with overnight, its a societal problem. It's not just football. It happens in society day-to-day. So my advice would be that it's not going to be able to get tackled overnight. Talking helps.\n\n\"Don't allow it to affect your soul.\"\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "\"Do not feel like you need to put in on your shoulders,\" the man known as the world's strongest footballer told Business Insider at the FIFA 20 launch.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9389/94483726b1034f2994e1e96280876873.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
