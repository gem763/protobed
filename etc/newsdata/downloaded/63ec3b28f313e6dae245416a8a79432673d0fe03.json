The company is also facing lawsuits involving its baby powder, opioids, medical devices and other products.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re operating within a very litigious environment, and we must at times be willing to go to trial when the science, facts and law are on our side,\u201d J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said in an email.\n\n\u201cWe also have to remain open to resolving cases through settlement when and where that\u2019s appropriate to do. We have a proven track record of being able to successfully and appropriately manage this balance,\u201d Knewitz added.\n\nThe company has had its share of legal wins, losses and settlements.\n\nAn Oklahoma judge in August ordered J&J to pay $572.1 million to that state for its part in fueling the opioid crisis by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers, although the sum was substantially less than investors had expected.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Johnson & Johnson logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 29, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nJohnson & Johnson has said it plans to appeal the ruling.\n\nEarlier this month, the company agreed to pay $20.4 million to settle claims by two Ohio counties, avoiding a federal opioid trial.\n\nIn 2013, J&J paid more than $2.2 billion to resolve civil and criminal investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice into its marketing of Risperdal and other drugs.", "description": "A jury award that hit Johnson & Johnson with $8 billion in punitive damages for a case involving its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal highlights the risks of the drugmaker's all-or-nothing legal strategy, several legal experts told Reuters on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Carl O", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438847408&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9818C", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
