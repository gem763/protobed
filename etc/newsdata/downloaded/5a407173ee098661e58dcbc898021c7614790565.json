In addition, Angelina Jolie will headline an upcoming \"Eternals\" film and Natalie Portman is slated to wield Thor's magical hammer in \"Thor: Love and Thunder.\"\n\nLarson recalled filming an \"Endgame\" sequence in the climactic finale that featured Captain Marvel fighting alongside the rest of Marvel's superheroines.\n\n\"To get to be with all of those women for the day ... it felt like we were a part of this like coven working together for this goal,\" Larson said. \"It was an opportunity for us to share and hang out. And as many people know, a lot of the time women aren\u2019t working together. It\u2019s kind of been this new breath of fresh air for us in our industry that there\u2019s more female ensemble films, which has allowed us the opportunity to really communicate with one another.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/09/brie-larson-marvel-women-all-female-movie/3921262002/", "description": "After having a huge team-up in 'Avengers,' Brie Larson says her fellow Marvel women are 'passionate' about an all-female superhero project.", "authors": ["Brian Truitt", "Published P.M.
