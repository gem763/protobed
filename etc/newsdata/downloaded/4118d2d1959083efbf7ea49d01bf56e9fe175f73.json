(Photo: Nicholas Kamm via Getty Images)\n\nPresidents and their families have celebrated Halloween at the White House since Mamie Eisenhower decorated it with skeletons and jack-o'-lanterns back in 1958. Continuing the light-hearted tradition, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania greeted young trick-or-treaters on the South Portico with baskets full of candy in front of festive decorations for the third year in a row.\n\nWhile the president may have faced some unwelcome \"boos\" at Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday, he happily entertained a few ghostly boos, along with ghouls and monsters, at the White House on Monday.\n\nWalking out to the Addams Family theme song, Donald and Melania welcomed military families and local school children with their parents in front of a Halloween display filled with spooky trees and pumpkins lining the East and West staircases.\n\nWhile the president and first lady did not dress up, the event stuck with a haunting theme thanks to instrumental music provided by the United States Air Force Strolling Strings, according to a statement released by the White House. Songs in the Strolling Strings' repertoire included Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Flight of the Bumblebee,\" Imagine Dragon's \"Radioactive,\" and even the theme song from the Jamie Lee Curtis horror classic, Halloween.\n\nInstead of a costume, Melania opted for what appears to be a leather patchwork trench coat by Michael Kors, retailing at $5,990.\n\nHanding out candy to trick-or-treaters has been a tradition since the Nixons invited local children to participate, but the costumes certainly have changed since then. While Richard and Pat Nixon saw their fair share of princesses and cowboys, the Trumps greeted creepy Pennywises from \u201cIt\u201d and inflatable dinosaurs. The couple was particularly delighted by a Minion from the \u201cDespicable Me\u201d-franchise.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump hand out candy for children at a Halloween celebration at the White House.

The Department of the Interior handed out Junior Ranger Explorer and Fishing books, as well as Buddy Bison stickers.\n\nChildren could also pose for photos with different backdrops thanks to the Department of Labor and Department of Education, while the U.S. Postal Service had \"spooky\" collection boxes and a postal truck for kids to explore. Children even saw \"The Beast,\" an alternative name for the presidential limo, thanks to the U.S. Secret Service.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "On Monday, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania welcomed local children and military families on the South Portico for trick-or-treating.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZcCyquoobpnmqiQl_Jt.Cw--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTU2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/8649e540-f9d9-11e9-83ca-aa3e87cbc151", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
