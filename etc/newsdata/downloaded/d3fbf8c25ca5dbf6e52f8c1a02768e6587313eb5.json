Nor has science determined when, where, how or how much marijuana might be safe to use.\n\nThat\u2019s because while it\u2019s perfectly legal and easy to smoke pot in states like Colorado, studying the drug is another matter.\n\nWhile marijuana use explodes around the nation and more states experiment with liberalizing cannabis policies, the federal government hasn\u2019t budged an inch toward legalization.\n\nThe inside, top, and outside, bottom, of a \u201cCannavan\u201d used by University of Colorado researchers to study marijuana. To get around federal restrictions, UC researchers use the Cannavans\u2019 mobile labs to test research subjects off campus, outside their homes, before and after they smoke or ingest marijuana. | Matt Nager\n\nMarijuana remains fully illegal at the federal level, and strict federal access policies tie the hands of researchers like UC\u2019s Angela Bryan and Kent Hutchison, who aren\u2019t allowed to bring the drug on campus or be present when it\u2019s consumed. The only way they can study Boulder\u2019s plentiful potheads, they\u2019ve discovered, is by parking their \u201cCannavan\u201d outside a home while its residents use the drug inside. They then ask them to come outside to the van for tests of how its active ingredients, called cannabinoids, have affected them.\n\nThe federal government continues to classify marijuana as a Schedule I drug, a product with \u201cno currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse,\u201d along with heroin and LSD. As a result, even legitimate researchers at labs and universities across the country must wade through restrictions on the clinical trials they run, which marijuana they can use and how it is shipped and stored.\n\nThis means states that have legalized cannabis for adult use are doing so in an information vacuum, with less understanding of what it is and what it does than virtually any nutritional supplement currently on the market, and with far less information than they have on legal substances that are easily abused, such as alcohol or tobacco. Law enforcement officers don\u2019t even know at what point it is unsafe for marijuana users to drive.\n\n\u201cWe suddenly have this huge influx of people who are able to buy cannabis, able to use it in all its various formulations,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cAnd we know nothing.\u201d\n\nThe questions they and members of their 20-member research team want to answer are far-ranging. Many volunteers are being assessed for the basic impact of cannabis on body chemistry and cognition, factors that could help policymakers set legal driving limits, or aid doctors in treatment of conditions that many believe marijuana can ease, such as PTSD. Other studies carried out with the vans focus on how cannabis can be used to treat anxiety, cancer pain and chemotherapy side effects. Bryan is finalizing a study on how cannabis can affect body weight, blood glucose and diabetes. Hutchison also hopes to study whether cannabis can help reduce opioid dependence.\n\nFor years, Bryan and Hutchison \u2014 who are a married couple as well as research partners \u2014 struggled to make headway in their research. Hutchison first tossed out the van idea as a joke, Bryan recalled. The university had nixed all their other ideas, which included an off-campus laboratory. But the \u201cCannavan\u201d idea passed legal muster.\n\nBut the Cannavans are not a perfect solution. For one, using a mobile lab is time-consuming. The researchers can only visit two vape- or smoke-using volunteers each day, at most. Researching edible forms of marijuana, like candy or cookies \u2014 is even harder. Edibles take more time to digest and take effect, so the researchers can spend hours in the van waiting to administer blood tests and cognition assessments, or to pose questions about pain, anxiety and other feelings.\n\nMoreover, the methodology isn\u2019t ideal. The gold standard in medical research is a randomized controlled trial using a well-defined drug. Bryan and Hutchison can only estimate the potency and chemical components of the products employed in their research, since they rely on volunteers to buy and administer their own pot. The researchers try to control the real-world factors by instructing patients to send them photos of the product they buy. By Colorado law, dispensaries must label products with the percentages of the chemicals in marijuana, including THC, CBD and a few other cannabinoids \u2014 that makes studies in that state a bit easier to standardize.\n\nThe recent marijuana vaping scare has shown the tragedy of federal foot-dragging, Hutchison said. More than 1,000 people, most of them using vapes containing THC, came down with serious lung disease over the summer that resulted in at least two dozen deaths. But even UC Boulder chemists could not test the mysterious marijuana vapes in university labs because of drug-free school laws. The Colorado group would not even be able to run animal studies, a key step in determining safety.\n\n\u201cWe can work with humans in the van,\u201d Hutchison said. But \u201cour best chemists are not allowed to bring any cannabis product on campus to test the purity and the safety of that product. And that\u2019s just crazy.\u201d\n\nUNDER FEDERAL LAW, the only other option for Bryan and researchers nationwide would be to obtain marijuana grown especially for research by the federal government at a single authorized facility, based at the University of Mississippi. That marijuana stock, first acquired more than 30 years ago and never updated, bears little resemblance to the marijuana consumed today; scientists around the country have described it as \u201cbrown, muddy garbage.\u201d It\u2019s also much weaker than marijuana strains used now and doesn\u2019t enable researchers to examine whether, say, high-THC pot affects patients\u2019 health differently than a less intense varietal. Plus, it's often moldy, according to a recent lawsuit.\n\nEven getting the maligned Mississippi weed comes with a host of barriers. Researchers need approval from the Food and Drug Administration for proposed studies. And they also need to pass muster with the Drug Enforcement Agency, which treats marijuana like the dangerous Schedule I drug federal law says it is and therefore requires costly safeguards like a limited-access room and a specific storage safe for the weed.\n\nPlasma samples for cannabinoid analysis, top and bottom, taken in the Cannavan by University of Colorado researchers. | Matt Nager\n\nThis year, the federal farm shipped marijuana to just 14 researchers by Aug. 30, 2019, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which manages the Mississippi contract; just 20 researchers received it in all of 2018.\n\nYet efforts to bring more approved growers \u2014 and ideally, better pot \u2014 into federal research have stalled. Three years ago, in the final months of the Obama administration, the DEA promised to approve more growers for medical marijuana but refused to reschedule the drug at the same time \u2014 and applications have since languished. Many accused the subsequent Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a longtime critic of marijuana legalization, of engineering the application freeze while peeling back protections for states legalizing pot and pushing harsher penalties for illicit drug-related crimes, including marijuana. Advocates celebrated his departure last year, but applications for new federal pot farmers were still parked on DEA\u2019s desk. Under court order, the agency promised in August to review 33 new applicants \u2014 but only after it issued new ground rules, for which it gave no timeline.\n\nMeanwhile, bills in Congress have failed to make it past committee markup as more hot-button issues crowd legislative calendars. The pot-related legislation ranges from efforts to simply force the DEA to approve more grow facilities to the more ambitious goal of moving marijuana out of the most restricted drug class.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has funded multiple health studies by the Colorado group and wants answers too, but it has to play by the rules set by the DEA.\n\nSue Sisley, an Arizona researcher whose petition spurred DEA to take its nominal first step in August, wants to study the drug\u2019s impact on PTSD in veterans. She said she hesitantly turned to the courts after years of attempts to access higher-quality marijuana for trials at the Scottsdale Research Institute.\n\nThe Mississippi facility\u2019s pot is inadequate for her studies and it doesn\u2019t make products like vapes or edibles, which many veterans would prefer, Sisley said. She\u2019s gotten tired of accepting \u201cvague reassurance from the current administration that they are going to act, finally.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was trying to ignite a national conversation about the harms of monopolies in general, but especially when it comes to research,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really detrimental to science when you have one drug supply for all of the U.S.\u201d\n\nLICENSING MORE GROWERS would only be a partial fix for the inundation of marijuana products on the market, scientists say. Unless the federal government reschedules marijuana, research\u2014especially on publicly funded campuses like UC Boulder \u2014 would still be hampered by other federal laws.\n\nIf he had a magic wand, Hutchison said, his first step would be to take marijuana out of Schedule I status while empowering the FDA to \u201cissue some rules about how to fast-track\u201d research on the drug. Without that groundwork, he and others worry that pot will remain in a scientific black hole.\n\nThe urgency of learning more about cannabis has been underlined by the national decriminalization of one of its components, cannabidiol, or CBD, an apparently non-intoxicating component. The 2018 farm bill enabled producers to grow low-potency marijuana, known as hemp, and to extract CBD from it.\n\nBut the fact that CBD is decriminalized doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s legal, exactly. Although the FDA has approved one cannabis-related drug for the treatment of epilepsy in children, pretty much all other medical claims for CBD use remain technically illegal. None the less, the cannabinoid has boomed in popularity as an unproven cure-all. States have issued a patchwork of regulations while federally, regulators are racing to build a legal framework for the slew of CBD-infused products, putting the cannabinoid in legal limbo even as people buy it off the shelves.\n\nCongressional efforts have largely swerved around the thorny problem of rescheduling marijuana and instead focused on lowering barriers and building incentives for research. This summer, longtime marijuana research advocate Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) joined forces with Senate Finance Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) to couple his bill, the MEDS Act, with legislation to encourage CBD and cannabis research. The bill would give the DEA a hard deadline to respond to applicants, require the Department of Health and Human Services to draw up a report on the potential benefits and risks of cannabis components, and address barriers pot-legal states face on regulation.\n\nIn theory, learning more about marijuana should be welcomed by opponents and supporters of legalization, since unbiased research could end up supporting either side. And indeed, anti-legalization advocates such as Smart Approaches to Marijuana have supported creating a special breakout of the Schedule I category just for marijuana research. Pot proponents oppose that position, however, seeing it as an attempt to slow momentum for nationwide legalization.\n\nBack in Colorado, Bryan and Hutchison are looking to expand their mobile operation. They\u2019re talking about getting a third van and setting their sights past Boulder \u2014 to Colorado Springs, Denver and Ft. Collins. They\u2019re also hoping to get a grant soon to study marijuana\u2019s impact on a fast-growing set of users: seniors.\n\nMore than 600 study participants have been tested in the Cannavans, and the team expects to publish some findings soon on questions such as CBD\u2019s medical efficacy alone or in combination with THC. In coming years, they hope to help shape the best formulation of the two for pain management.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this world where we have unfettered access to these products for all these different conditions and we can\u2019t tell people what to do,\u201d Bryan said.\n\nHutchison said that every year that passes without better research on marijuana, the greater the gap between how much cannabis is being used and how little is known about it.\n\n\u201cIt takes time \u2013 that\u2019s the thing, Hutchison said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re so far behind.\u201d\n\nSarah Owermohle covers the Food and Drug Administration for POLITICO Pro.\n\n", "description": "Federal restrictions hamper research on marijuana \u2014 and inspire clever workarounds.", "authors": ["Sarah Owermohle"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/05/3e/d8f058e644ee91c5b4c3b165a210/lede-owermohle-nager.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
