Two men aged 74 and 78 are in a serious but stable condition in hospital after the incident in Bayonne on Monday afternoon.\n\nPolice said a man tried to set fire to the door of the mosque and that when he was interrupted, he opened fire. The man then set fire to a car before fleeing, police said.\n\nThe suspect was arrested close to his home in the Landes, 10 miles away. The two injured men are believed to have been worshippers at the mosque.\n\nA police source told Reuters that the suspect was a candidate in local elections in the Landes in 2015 for Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right party, Front National, which has since been renamed National Rally. He took 18% of the vote in the first round.\n\nNicolas Bay of the National Rally confirmed to Cnews TV channel that the suspect had been a candidate, but he had left the party saying its ideas didn\u2019t suit him. Bay said: \u201cHe is an extremist who had no place in our ranks and who left.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the National Rally said the suspect had been removed from his local federation following the 2015 local elections after comments found to be \u201cagainst the spirit and political line\u201d of the party. He had left the party.\n\nThe French president Emmanuel Macron condemned the \u201chateful\u201d attack, saying: \u201cThe republic will never tolerate hate\u201d. He promised to \u201cprotect our Muslim fellow citizens\u201d.\n\nFrance\u2019s interior minister, Christophe Castaner, offered his \u201csolidarity and support to the Muslim community\u201d over the attack and said he felt their \u201cshock and fear\u201d.\n\nLe Pen condemned what she called an \u201cunspeakable attack\u201d and said it was \u201cabsolutely contrary to the values of our movement\u201d. She said: \u201cThese crimes must be dealt with with the utmost severity.\u201d\n\nFrance has been grappling with a fresh political row over the Muslim headscarf and calls by some on the right to ban mothers in headscarves from volunteering on school trips.\n\nThis month 90 personalities, including actors and writers, signed an open letter in Le Monde calling on the president, Emmanuel Macron, \u201cto say with force that Muslim women, whether they wear a headscarf or not, and Muslims in general have a place in our society \u2013 and to refuse our fellow Muslim citizens being monitored, stigmatised or denounced for the practice of their religion\u201d.\n\nJean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, leader of the leftwing France Unbowed party, tweeted on Monday: \u201cIn Bayonne the harassment of Muslims has produced its effect. Enough is enough now.\u201d He called on all public figures to \u201cstop encouraging hatred\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Local residents, fire and police officers stand outside the Bayonne mosque after the incident. Photograph: STR/AP\n\nHours before the mosque attack in Bayonne, Macron had met Muslim leaders at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace and urged France\u2019s Muslim community to step up the fight against \u201cseparatism\u201d, in the wake of a recent attack by a radicalised police employee who stabbed four colleagues to death in Paris.\n\nThere have been intermittent attacks on mosques in France in recent years. In 2007, 148 Muslim headstones in a national military cemetery near Arras were smeared with anti-Islamic slurs and a pig\u2019s head was placed among them. In March this year, workers building a mosque in the south-western town of Bergerac found a pig\u2019s head and animal blood at the entrance to the site.\n\nMosques were also targeted after the killing of 12 people at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015. Dozens of mosques were attacked by arsonists, and others with firebombs, grenades or gunfire.", "description": "Suspect in incident in Bayonne, south-west France, once stood as candidate for far-right Front National in local election", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e62fc9b245547b04d258b0cc5309d7f061188db7/0_161_4836_2902/master/4836.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=24ab21c6734a5dfa1e9dab59cfb994d0", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
