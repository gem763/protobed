The Kurdish-led SDF, which did the bulk of the fighting in Syria in the yearslong fight against the Islamic State, had operated with virtual autonomy in northeastern Syria, but the group\u2019s newfound peace with Mr. Assad strengthens Damascus\u2019 hold over his war-torn country and sets the stage for a bloody battle with Turkey in the key city of Manbij and elsewhere across the nation.\n\nAfter eight years of civil war, the U.S. move clears the way for the Assad government to reassert control over almost all of the country, with just rebel-held areas in Idlib province holding out.\n\nMr. Trump made clear that he doesn\u2019t care how the situation shakes out on the ground and has absolutely no preference who comes to the aid of the SDF, even if it\u2019s America\u2019s chief rivals on the global stage.\n\n\u201cAfter defeating 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, I largely moved our troops out of Syria \u2026,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a Twitter message. \u201cAnyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d\n\nBut after apparently acquiescing last week to Ankara\u2019s incursion into northern Syria, the president escalated his threat Monday afternoon to \u201cswiftly destroy\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it proceeds with its invasion. In a statement, he announced that Washington would end trade negotiations with Ankara and impose sanctions on top officials of the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n\u201cI am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path,\u201d the statement said.\n\nU.S. sanctions\n\nThe Turkish assault on SDF positions began last week after Mr. Trump announced that the U.S. would pull a few dozen special operations forces from key buffer zones along the Turkey-Syria border. The small number of troops was widely viewed as a deterrent keeping Turkey from launching attacks on the SDF, which Turkey considers to be terrorist allies of a long-running Kurdish separatist movement inside Turkey.\n\nAs Turkey\u2019s attack gained steam over the weekend, Mr. Trump went further and instructed the Pentagon to withdraw virtually all of the 1,000 U.S. troops stationed in northern Syria lest they be caught in the crossfire. The president and military officials said they have no appetite to get caught in the middle of a fight between Turkey and the burgeoning SDF-Assad-Russia force.\n\nU.S. troops were still stationed in northern Syria on Monday but were in the process of moving out.\n\nCoordinating now with Mr. Assad\u2019s troops, the SDF is girding for a showdown with Turkey in the strategic city of Manbij, which had been home to U.S. military outposts. Top SDF officials said the agreement with Mr. Assad is for military defense only, suggesting that the Kurds expect to return to semi-autonomous rule once the Turkish advance is repelled.\n\n\u201cThere is an understanding between SDF and Damascus \u2014 a military agreement only,\u201d Badran Ciya Kurd, a senior Kurdish official, told The Associated Press.\n\nIn the U.S., powerful lawmakers are increasingly concerned that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision will ultimately lead to a resurgence of the Islamic State group.\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s offensive against our Syrian Kurdish partners is jeopardizing years of hard-won progress in the fight against ISIS,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said in a statement.\n\nOther prominent members of Congress are calling on Mr. Trump to rescind an invitation for Mr. Erdogan to visit the White House on Nov. 13.\n\nFrance, Germany and other key European nations said they will stop selling arms to Turkey unless Ankara immediately ends its attack on the Kurds. European Union and NATO officials warned that the deteriorating situation in Syria could lead to an ISIS resurgence, which would endanger European security.\n\nBut Mr. Erdogan countered by flaunting his country\u2019s status as a NATO member, even as the Syria invasion threatens to divide the decades-old alliance.\n\n\u2981 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
