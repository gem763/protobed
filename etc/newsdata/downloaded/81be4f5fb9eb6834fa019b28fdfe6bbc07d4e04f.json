On this week\u2019s episode of Why\u2019d You Push That Button?, we want to hear love stories and stories of failed courtship attempts. We ask why people slide into DMs, and then we process how the direct message\u2019s connotation has changed over time.\n\nWe chat with our friend Blake who has slid into multiple DMs, as well as Tasbeeh Herwees, who called DMs the \u201cnew little black book\u201d in MEL. Then we talk to a man named Thomas who met his boyfriend on Twitter through the DMs. We love love!\n\nFinally, we take all our questions and thoughts to Connor Hayes, the director of product for Instagram messaging, who explains what the company has seen when it comes to DM behavior and what the future looks like for DMs. Notably, he says that Instagram wants to feel like a cool party where you can talk to all your friends, especially once Facebook merges all its messaging products together. This intimidates me, to be honest. Sometimes I don\u2019t want to be at a party.\n\n\u201cIf we do our job well, at the end of the day Instagram, when you open it up, is going to feel a lot more like walking into a party and hanging out with your friends than it is today, and we see messaging as a big part of that,\u201d he says.\n\nListen to the episode above, and you can subscribe to the show anywhere you typically get your podcasts. To make it easy for you, we\u2019ve also got our usual places linked: Apple Podcasts, Pocket Casts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, and our RSS feed.", "description": "On this week\u2019s episode of Why\u2019d You Push That Button?, Ashley Carman and Kaitlyn Tiffany ask why people slide into other people\u2019s direct messages.
