A survey from the Pew Research Center in February found that 73% of Americans believe it should not be a factor.\n\nBetween the lines: The admissions process is just as much about admitting Ivy League legacies, children of big donors and athletes as pitting Asian Americans up against Latino and black applicants.\n\nWhat they're saying: House Education and Labor chairman and Harvard grad Bobby Scott (D-Va) supported the district court's decision, saying in a statement that it it \"affirms the constitutionality of admissions policies that recognize that there is a compelling interest in advancing a diverse student body.\"", "description": "\"Removing considerations of race and ethnicity\" at Harvard \"would deprive applicants,\" a federal judge found.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/-RLaTZy3IcBqrUqsvE5DUoPhPjY=/0x420:5232x3363/1920x1080/2019/10/01/1569959856748.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
