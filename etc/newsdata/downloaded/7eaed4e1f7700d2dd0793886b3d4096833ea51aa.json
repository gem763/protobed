Green provided the New Times with a report from an exterminator in March 2015 that cited about 45 Arizona bark scorpions on the property.\n\nAccording to the National Park Service, Arizona bark scorpions \"are the most venomous scorpion in North America.\"\n\nEpstein before a Cubs game in March 2019.
