The Mets walked off the field in disbelief. The Nationals spilled onto it in shocked celebration. They had stumbled all night, first when Max Scherzer gave up four runs in the fourth inning, then when Roenis El\u00edas gave up home runs in the eighth and ninth, then when the Mets scored four more runs off a bullpen that still can\u2019t figure it out.\n\nBut the Nationals kept at it, their offense making use of a few final breaths, the seven-run effort standing as the largest ninth-inning comeback in team history. The first run came in on a Trea Turner double, the next on a single by Anthony Rendon, the next two on a pinch-hit double by Ryan Zimmerman. Then Suzuki stepped into a full-count fastball from Mets closer Edwin D\u00edaz and blasted it into the left field seats. The win helps Washington keep pace with the Braves in the National League East, if only barely, as they remain 6 1 / 2 games out with a four-game series looming in Atlanta this weekend.\n\n[Box score: Nationals 11, Mets 10]\n\nThis was Scherzer\u2019s third start since he returned from the injured list Aug. 22. He missed close to seven weeks, save one late July appearance, with a list of diagnoses that included a mid-back strain, bursitis in the scapula below his right shoulder blade and a mild rhomboid muscle strain. They were sometimes referred to, collectively, as a back problem. Other times the word \u201cshoulder,\u201d far more daunting for a pitcher, crept into the public conversation. Yet the company line never wavered. The Nationals need Scherzer, their ace, their best hope in a playoff push, at 100 percent.\n\nHe has been steadily rebuilding his workload across the past two weeks. He threw 71 pitches in four innings against the Pittsburgh Pirates in his first start back. He lasted 18 pitches longer, and just one out deeper, against the Baltimore Orioles six days later. Then this start was pegged as a bigger step toward Scherzer\u2019s regular self. Manager Dave Martinez expected him to top 90 pitches. Scherzer, having recovered well, had hinted that he could be unleashed. He itched to put everything behind his running fastball. He wanted to test his arm and back and shoulder, for real, and see how his body responded.\n\nThe early and late results were encouraging. The middle was not. The Nationals gave him an early lead when Juan Soto doubled in Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera in the first. Scherzer held it for three innings, striking out five in the process, setting up his off-speed stuff with a fastball that had renewed life. But a second trip through the Mets\u2019 lineup was a speed bump. Then it was a full-on wall.\n\nScherzer had not allowed a hit going into the fourth. That changed when Pete Alonso and Michael Conforto started the inning with back-to-back singles. Alonso went with a first-pitch slider low and off the outside corner. Conforto stalked a first-pitch cutter on the outer half of the plate. Wilson Ramos followed with a double, extending his hitting streak to 26 games, and he used a first-pitch fastball to do so. Only the pitch to Conforto would have been called a strike. The Mets handled them anyway. Then Brandon Nimmo lifted a sacrifice fly to center, bringing in another run, and Joe Panik ambushed Scherzer again.\n\n[After four years and a gruesome injury, Nationals reliever Aaron Barrett is returning to the majors]\n\nGerardo Parra turned and sprinted after Panik\u2019s drive to right. But he slowed once his feet neared the warning track. Panik got just enough of the 92-mph cutter to land it in the first row of seats. Scherzer gave up a double to Luis Guillorme before finishing the inning. He bounced back with a quick fifth, retiring the side in order, and did the same in the sixth. He made it to 90 pitches. His average fastball velocity was a normal 94.8. He just wasn\u2019t quite sharp enough in another test drive.\n\nBut the Nationals were up to bailing him out, and more so bailing the bullpen out, by night\u2019s end. The first comeback attempt started in the sixth, when Suzuki knocked in Soto with a single off the wall. But because Matt Adams got a bad a read on it and couldn\u2019t get past second base, Suzuki held up at first and a double play stayed intact. Parra bounced into one three pitches later to end the threat.\n\nEl\u00edas yielded a Jeff McNeil homer in the eighth, upping the deficit to three runs again, and Soto\u2019s two-run shot in the bottom of the inning could only bring it back to one. Then it was back to two runs after Nimmo took El\u00edas deep to start the ninth. Then it stretched to six after McNeil added a two-run single and Alonso lifted a two-run homer off Daniel Hudson.\n\nYet that only set the stage for the theatrics. The lasting image of Tuesday could have been Scherzer\u2019s bad inning, a few defensive miscues, or El\u00edas and Hudson struggling to keep runs off the board. But instead it was Suzuki, all but pulling his teammates onto the field himself, circling the bases while they all gathered around home plate.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 total effort was far from pretty. Their celebration was still deserved.", "description": "Kurt Suzuki\u2019s walk-off three-run home run caps the biggest ninth-inning rally in team history for an 11-10 stunner.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals.", "September At Pm", "Jesse Dougherty Covers The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/X62LvS36OZtyW6HqvUPLCm0poi0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SJRJU7GOXQI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
