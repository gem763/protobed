(Erin Scott/Reuters)\n\nRepresentative Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) on Wednesday afternoon contradicted earlier reports that she was set to join fellow members of \u201cThe Squad\u201d Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) in endorsing Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cI have not made any endorsement at this time. It is critically important to me to involve my residents and my district in every major decision I make, because staying rooted in our community makes our movement stronger,\u201d Tlaib told the Detroit Free Press in a statement.\n\nTlaib explained that while she is bringing Sanders to her Michigan district on October 27, \u201cI need to know that anyone I choose to endorse will fight for my residents, and I appreciate the opportunity for them to have a dialogue with Sen. Sanders about these critically important issues.\u201d\n\nThe comments contradict several media reports and a tweet by Omar earlier Wednesday that suggested Tlaib was joining her and Ocasio-Cortez in endorsing Sanders.\n\nTlaib\u2019s hesitancy to endorse Sanders likely stems from her district demographics, which ensure a competitive 2020 primary race. She won the 2018 primary by four points over a crowded field.\n\n\u201cTlaib is only squad member who will likely face a competitive primary, and she narrowly won a crowded primary where black vote split across several candidates. She is undoubtedly a Bernie Sanders fan, but unsurprising she seems to be taking different endorsement route,\u201d New York Times reporter Astead Herndon tweeted in response to the news.", "description": "Representative Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) on Wednesday afternoon contradicted earlier reports that she was set to join fellow members of \u201cThe Squad\u201d Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) in endorsing Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
