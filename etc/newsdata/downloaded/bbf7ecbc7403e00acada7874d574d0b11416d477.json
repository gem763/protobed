They then would look to see if they can extend that core competency to other areas \u2013 like transport fuels \u2013 and trade those in a similar way.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Mr Redman pledged continued discipline in capital investment even as the utility is likely \"buffeted\" by turbulence in the energy sector, which is set to drag down profits this year.\n\n\"We are being thoughtful as to where we put your dollars,\" he told investors. \"It's about managing through the tricky times with operational and financial discipline. AGL is playing the long game.\"\n\nAGL confirmed that profit was set to drop this year as it battles headwinds including the introduction of default market offers for retail electricity prices, an expected decline in average wholesale prices and higher coal and gas costs. The outage at a unit at the large Loy Yang A coal generator in Victoria is also set to shave as much as $100 million from gross profits, even as it tracks toward an on-schedule restart on December 16 in time for peak summer demand.\n\nMeanwhile the Morrison government is pushing through its \"big stick\" legislation that could force the divestment of assets by integrated suppliers such as AGL.\n\nChief financial officer Damien Nicks reiterated guidance that underlying profit would fall to between $780 million and $860 million, as much as 25 per cent down from 2018-19.\n\nThe move into transport fuels is already occurring given AGL's involvement in batteries, but could stretch beyond that as markets evolve, AGL's head of wholesale markets Richard Wrightson said later in an interview.\n\nThat evolution has prompted Shell to shift into electricity, setting up up a power and gas trading business on the east coast and in August striking a $617 million deal to buy generator and retailer ERM Power, directly pitting itself AGL.\n\nIn a further shake-up of ownership in the sector involving AGL, AMP Capital agreed to buy 50 per cent of the country's largest wind farm, which is fully contracted to the utility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deal sees two AMP funds buy out Malaysia's Malakoff from the 420MW Macarthur wind farm in south-west Victoria in an $880 million deal. Infrastructure investor Morrison & Co retains the rest.\n\nIn the deal with Maoneng, AGL will pay a fixed price to use capacity from the four batteries, each of which could power up to 30,000 homes for up to two hours. Mr Wrightson said the price for the power was \"very competitive\" for AGL, which is however still pursuing other on-demand generation projects in NSW including a gas power generator near Newcastle and, longer-term, a pumped hydro project at Bells Mountain.\n\nFederal energy minister Angus Taylor welcomed AGL's actions to bring greater reliability and storage into the National Electricity Market.\n\n\"The Commonwealth has been clear that many jurisdictions have a mounting reliability problem and that more investment is required,\" Mr Taylor said.", "description": "A return to gas production hasn't been ruled out by chief executive Brett Redman, who hinted a move into transport fuels could also be on the cards.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.22%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_107/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d247f64ff4843c01780592d44dfb313da5af4f59", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
