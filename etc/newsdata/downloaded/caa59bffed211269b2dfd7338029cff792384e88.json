Katie Hill, the California Democrat embroiled in a legal battle over the publication of nude photos, and facing a House ethics probe over an alleged affair with a male aide, paid a $5,100 \u201celection bonus\u201d to the aide in April, according to reports.\n\nIn addition, Hill used her \u201cinfluence\u201d to help her husband get a series of jobs at the nonprofit agency where she worked prior to being elected, according to court documents.\n\nAnd Federal Election Commission records show that Hill \u2013 an openly bisexual 32-year-old married woman now facing a divorce -- was paying consulting fees up until last month to a 24-year-old female campaign staffer with whom Hill has admitted having an \u201cinappropriate\u201d relationship, the Washington Examiner reported.\n\nREP. KATIE HILL FIGHTS BACK AMID CLAIMS SHE WAS INVOLVED IN ROMANTIC 'THROUPLE' WITH STAFFER\n\nThe female staffer, identified as Morgan Desjardins, is the clothed woman seen having her hair brushed by a naked Hill in one of the photos recently posted online by the DailyMail. Hill, Desjardins and Hill\u2019s now-estranged husband, Kenny Heslep, reportedly engaged in a \u201cthroupling\u201d relationship that ended over the summer, the New York Post reported.\n\nHill admitted earlier this month that her relationship with Desjardins was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\nBut it was reportedly the alleged relationship with the male aide, identified as Graham Kelly, that last week sparked a House Ethics Committee investigation of Hill because of House rules against sexual relationships with subordinates. The congresswoman has denied having a relationship with Kelly.\n\nThe allegation of a Hill-Kelly relationship was made in a now-deleted Facebook post by Heslep, RedState reported, and is said to be the prime reason for Heslep\u2019s decision to seek a divorce from Hill, according to reports.\n\nIn a recent letter to her constituents, however, Hill contended that Heslep was \u201can abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me.\u201d\n\nAccording to Newsweek, Hill asked U.S. Capitol Police to investigate whether posting of the nude photos violated any laws. Hill's lawyers also recently sent a \u201ccease and desist\u201d order, demanding the images be taken down from the Internet, but the photos were still visible on the DailyMail site as of Sunday.\n\nKelly received the bonus April 27, and it was nearly twice the amount that three other Hill campaign staffers received, the Post reported. He had raised more than $8 million for Hill\u2019s primary- and general election campaigns in 2018, according to the Post.\n\nAccording to CNBC, divorce papers filed in Los Angeles include an assertion by Heslep that Hill wanted him to be what\u2019s commonly called a \u201chouse husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me that she wanted me to stay at home and care for our household,\u201d Heslep said, according to the report. \u201cShe told me that she did not like to do household chores and duties and wanted me to stay at home and do those things while she worked.\u201d\n\nHeslep claimed in his court filing that he has only a high school diploma and hasn\u2019t worked since 2014, CNBC reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPrior to being elected to Congress, Hill worked for a nonprofit called People Assisting the Homeless, and Heslep contends in the divorce filings that Hill used her \u201cinfluence\u201d to get him a series of jobs with the organization, until he was laid off from the final role in 2014.\n\n\u201cI have not been employed since that time,\u201d Heslep wrote, according to CNBC.\n\nHeslep said Hill left him in June, taking the couple\u2019s \u201conly operable vehicle,\u201d and he is now asking a judge to order Hill to pay him spousal support and attorney fees.\n\nA spokesperson for Hill's office did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment.", "description": "U.S. Rep.
