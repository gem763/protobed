Check this out.\n\nstock market rally More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA \u201cLehman-like\u201d market disaster could happen this week, analyst warns\n\nSeriously?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe analyst cited negative sentiment triggered by the inversion of the yield curve and how it correlated to 2008. (Here\u2019s the article if you really want to read it.) I think he needs to be held responsible if he\u2019s wrong.\n\nI am sick of hacks trying to make names for themselves with insane and irresponsible Doomsday Calls. Do yourself a favor and ignore them. Instead of becoming fearful with these crazy calls, now is the time to set yourself up for big profits.\n\nI think we\u2019re headed for one of the greatest \u201cmelt-ups\u201d (as my colleague Steve Sjuggerud accurately calls it) over the next 12-18 months. The new issue of Investment Opportunities will focus on stocks that I believe will be among the leaders of that rally, and I want to give you a preview of my analysis today.\n\nAlready Moving Higher\n\nLet\u2019s dispense quickly with the idea that a recession is around the corner. I shared my full market outlook with you this weekend, but I\u2019ve written before about the inverted yield curve and talked about it at length in a recent MoneyLine podcast (which you can listen to here).\n\nI\u2019ll share one stat with you now: Over the last 40 years, an inverted yield curve has actually been more of a buy signal than a recession indicator. Since 1978, the market has gained 20%+ on average one year after the inversion event when the 10-year Treasury begins to yield less than the two-year Treasury.\n\nAdd in the likelihood that the Fed will lower interest rates a couple more times this year, and the odds of a major rally increase.\n\nBut even if you\u2019re skeptical, please don\u2019t ignore a tried-and-true buying opportunity that so many other investors are missing amid the panic.\n\nI\u2019m talking about housing stocks. I know. They don\u2019t sound as exciting as next-generation batteries, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, or personalized medicine. But who cares \u2014 as long as they can make us money?\n\nTake a look at the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB). It broke above $40 last week for the first time since last June. That is a potentially major breakout going back to levels from 18 months prior. It also broke out of a consolidation phase that lasted about three months.\n\nITB Performance Chart More\n\nThose are two bullish technical indicators, and I see more upside ahead with very low housing stock valuations and strong fundamentals.\n\nYou may not hear much about strong fundamentals in the current environment, but they\u2019re there. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is at all-time highs, and Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW) is within about 6% of its peak. Both reported solid sales growth, as did consumer bellwethers Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT). This tells us that the consumer is doing pretty well, and so is the housing market.", "description": "When I saw the headline below last Tuesday, it made me angry. Really angry.
