President Obama expanded protections in 2012 for intelligence whistleblowers using his executive authority. Congress codified some of those changes into law two years later.\n\nThe aim was to allow officials in intelligence agencies a pathway to disclose wrongdoing involving classified programs to the independent watchdog that oversees intelligence agencies, as well as the congressional committees that supervise intelligence activity.\n\nBut the whistleblower law has been controversial from the start. Some advocates say it doesn\u2019t go far enough in protecting officials who want to make disclosures, while several presidential administrations have maintained that it can\u2019t force disclosure of classified information to Congress.\n\nLast month, a whistleblower within the executive branch filed a complaint that has prompted a standoff between the U.S. intelligence community and Democrats in the House of Representatives. People familiar with the matter have said it involves Mr. Trump\u2019s communications with a foreign leader\u2014possibly Ukraine\u2019s. The intelligence community inspector general deemed the complaint to be credible and relevant to intelligence activities, a determination that is supposed to trigger a disclosure to Congress.\n\nHowever, the director of national intelligence in consultation with the Justice Department concluded that the matter was not one of \u201curgent concern\u201d\u2014part of the standard under the law\u2014and blocked the complaint\u2019s transmission to Congress. House Democrats have demanded that the whistleblower complaint be forwarded, sending a subpoena to the nation\u2019s intelligence chief for information about the matter.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly what we want whistleblowers to do when they learn about government conduct, which in their assessment, should be evaluated by appropriate authorities\u2014to utilize the statutory course of action that Congress has devised to make that disclosure consist with the law,\u201d said David Laufman, a former Justice Department national security official now a lawyer in private practice at the firm Wiggin and Dana.\n\n\u201cAs far as I can tell, this is what this individual has done,\u201d Mr. Laufman said. \u201cHe did exactly what the law contemplated.\u201d\n\nFurther complicating the matter is that the president himself is involved in the complaint. Administrations of both parties have claimed that some presidential communications are protected\u2014even from Congress\u2014by a legal doctrine known as executive privilege.\n\n\u201cThese laws and authorities were not designed with the president in mind as the actor,\u201d said Katrina Mulligan, a former Justice Department official who now works at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress. \u201cIt does fall in a gray area.\u201d\n\nPresidents dating to George Washington have invoked the general principle that some information should be shielded from disclosure to the public or to Congress in the interests of confidentiality or national security.\n\nThe Supreme Court has affirmed the general concept of executive privilege during the Watergate era, in the landmark case ordering President Nixon to comply with a subpoena for tapes of his Oval Office conversations. In United States v. Nixon, the Supreme Court held that the privilege existed, but that a demand from a prosecutor as part of a criminal investigation could overcome such a privilege.\n\nThe high court, however, has never addressed under what circumstances a congressional demand could overcome executive privilege. That has left ambiguity over what exactly is privileged and under what circumstances Congress can obtain that material.\n\nThe privilege exists to protect candid discussion by government officials, said Bobby Chesney, a professor of law at the University of Texas. But it can\u2019t be absolute, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would really want the rule to be that if the president says something to a foreign leader, it\u2019s somehow secret forever,\u201d Mr. Chesney said.\n\nWhen President Clinton signed the 1998 intelligence whistleblower law, he said in a statement: \u201cThe Act does not constrain my constitutional authority to review and, if appropriate, control disclosure of certain classified information to the Congress\u201d\u2014in essence, rejecting the theory that Congress could mandate disclosure of classified material to Congress.\n\nMr. Obama echoed that language in 2014 when Congress added additional protections for intelligence whistleblowers.\n\nMark Zaid, a lawyer who has represented national-security whistleblowers for more than 20 years, said that the current administration\u2019s claim that Mr. Trump\u2019s communications might be \u201cprivileged\u201d is in line with the stances of previous presidents, including Democrats. But in the past, he said, Congress and the executive branch have usually been able to reach an accommodation about the release of certain materials.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned there is a politicization of the legal process surrounding whistleblowing,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitics has interfered in this case, it looks, on both sides.\u201d\n\n\u2014Dustin Volz and Warren Strobel contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com", "description": "At the heart of an legal showdown over an anonymous whistleblower\u2019s complaint concerning President Trump is a law designed to allow members of the intelligence community to bring forward evidence of wrongdoing by the government.", "authors": ["Byron Tau", "Byron.Tau Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109463/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
