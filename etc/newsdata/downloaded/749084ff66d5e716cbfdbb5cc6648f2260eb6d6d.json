Born in 1948, Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 grew up not far from the southern Mexico City park where fans gathered to mourn him throughout the weekend. Under a constant light rain and cloudy skies, the crowd broke into applause for their local hero, followed by a neighborhood band's military-style final salute.
