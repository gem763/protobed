Reminder: There are 108 days until the Iowa caucuses and 382 days until the 2020 presidential election.\n\n[Who\u2019s running for president? Click here for Yahoo News\u2019 2020 tracker]\n\n2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said this week that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, is likely being groomed by Moscow as a third-party candidate for the 2020 race.\n\nIn an interview on the podcast of former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, Clinton expressed her concerns about possible Russian interference in 2020.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re also going to do third-party again,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on someone who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d\n\nWhile Clinton didn\u2019t mention Gabbard by name, no other female candidates currently running in the primary \u2014 Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar and spiritualist author Marianne Williamson \u2014 have been accused of having ties to Russia.\n\nClinton also labeled Jill Stein, who ran for president in 2016 as a Green Party candidate, as \u201ca Russian asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she\u2019s also a Russian asset,\u201d said Clinton. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s a Russian asset \u2014 I mean, totally. They know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate. So I don\u2019t know who it\u2019s going to be, but I will guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most needed.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s team didn\u2019t back off the claim on Friday.\n\n\u201cIf the nesting doll fits,\u201d Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill told CNN. \u201cThis is not some outlandish claim. This is reality. If the Russian propaganda machine, both their state media and their bot and troll operations, is backing a candidate aligned with their interests, that is just a reality, it is not speculation.\u201d\n\nGabbard responded in a series of tweets Friday afternoon:\n\nGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton . You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a ...\n\n... powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose. It\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.\n\nGabbard has not ruled out a third-party run but defended herself against the charges that she was a Russian asset at Tuesday\u2019s primary debate.\n\n\u201cJust two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears,\u201d said Gabbard. \u201cThis morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wave to the crowd at a rally in Wichita, Kan., last year. (Photo: J. Pat Carter for the Washington Post/Getty Images)\n\nTwo weeks ago, Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign looked to be in a tough spot. While he continued to pull in money from a wide base of donors, he had stalled out and Sanders himself suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Nevada, raising questions about whether his run would continue.\n\nThis week saw a positive change of fortune for the 78-year-old independent senator from Vermont. On Tuesday night, Sanders made his first appearance since the heart attack, looking spry and sounding on message during the primary debate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d said Sanders when asked how he could assure voters he was up to the task of being president after having just suffered a heart attack.\n\n\u201cWell, let me invite you all to a major rally we\u2019re having in Queens, New York,\u201d Sanders added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a special guest at that event. And we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people.\u201d\n\nWhen Bernie Sanders said he planned to mount a \"vigorous\" post-heart attack campaign, I guess he wasn't kidding. pic.twitter.com/fVZv7DLFFi \u2014 Dylan Stableford (@stableford) October 18, 2019\n\nBefore the debate concluded, multiple outlets reported that the special guest for Saturday\u2019s event would be Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman Democrat from New York. Politico reported that Ocasio-Cortez, who was an organizer for Sanders in 2016 prior to her own insurgent run at the House, called Sanders in his hospital bed to inform him she was coming aboard earlier than she had initially planned.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Ocasio-Cortez will have a major impact on the primary, but her 5.5 million Twitter followers are more than former Vice President Joe Biden (3.9 million) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (3.4 million), the current frontrunners in the race. Among Democrats with an opinion on both Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders, the former is more popular among women voters, white voters and the wealthiest voters, potentially giving the senator a bump.\n\nSanders also picked up an endorsement from Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.,, who announced her decision minutes after Tuesday\u2019s debate ended. A video posted by Omar explaining her support for Sanders was retweeted over 12,000 times:\n\nBetween Ocasio-Cortez, the most prominent Latina politician in the country, and Omar, who is black and Muslim, Sanders potentially helps himself in a Democratic primary with a diverse field of voters. The pair \u2014 Ocasio-Cortez is 30, Omar is 38 \u2014 also add another dash of youth to the elder democratic socialist\u2019s bid.\n\n.@BernieSanders isn\u2019t fighting to win just one presidential election -- he\u2019s fighting for the soul of our democracy.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s more on why I\u2019m so proud to give Bernie my endorsement for president of the United States: pic.twitter.com/1NLMPnzS1x \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cI have been deeply impressed by her ability to inspire people all over this country \u2014 young people especially, people of color especially \u2014 in the struggle for economic justice, the social justice, for racial justice and for environmental justice,\u201d Sanders said of Ocasio-Cortez in an interview with NY1 about the endorsement. \u201cShe is really an inspiration to people, not only in New York but all over this country, and I\u2019m very, very proud that she is now part of our campaign.\u201d\n\nThere was some thought that Ocasio-Cortez might throw her backing behind Warren, who wrote a Time magazine tribute to the congresswoman and appeared with her in a video critical of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Asked about the reports after the debate, Warren said they were all on the same team.\n\n\u201cLook, I have great respect for all three of those women,\u201d said Warren, referring to Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who was initially reported to be leaning toward endorsing Sanders. \u201cI think they are terrific. And here\u2019s what I know for sure \u2014 when this primary is over, we are all going to be on the same side.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez liked a tweet from editor David Klion that suggested she agrees with the Massachusetts senator\u2019s assessment.\n\n\u201cBernie and Warren genuinely like and respect each other and the effort to turn them into ideological nemeses based on their most annoying Twitter supporters is myopic,\u201d wrote Klion. \u201cEventually one of them will happily endorse the other and the whole thing will seem dumb in hindsight.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden speaking at a women's leadership forum in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. (Photo: Alex Brandon/AP) More\n\nBiden\u2019s money troubles\n\nDespite a deluge of attacks from the White House attempting to paint him as corrupt, Biden has mostly maintained his position atop most national polls of the Democratic presidential field. But a potential red flag was raised earlier this week.\n\nThe Biden campaign has just $8.9 million in cash on hand after spending more than it brought in during the third quarter, including nearly $1 million on private plane travel. In comparison, Sanders has $33.7 million in cash on hand, while Warren has $25.7 million and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has $23.4 million.\n\nBiden also has a more limited donor pool, as just 38 percent of the $22 million he raised in the first half of the year came from donations of $200 or lower. That\u2019s in comparison to 77 percent small donors for Sanders and 67 percent for Warren. Donors are allowed to give only $2,800 to each primary candidate, meaning donors who give in smaller amounts can give again, versus those who max out early in the cycle.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental question about fundraising is: Do you have what you need to run your race? And we do,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, deputy campaign manager for Biden, told the New York Times.\n\nA Washington Post analysis of third quarter spending contrasted with poll movement during the same period showed that Biden did not get much bang for his buck, spending $17.2 million over that time while dropping nearly 3 points in the polls. Warren had the best numbers, spending $18.6 to move up almost 10 points. Both Sanders and Buttigieg spent heavily ($21.3 million and $18.6 million, respectively) to stay in the same spot. The breakdown was also positive for businessman Andrew Yang ($4.3 million to move up 2 points), negative for Harris ($14.4 million to drop 5 points) and a nightmare for billionaire activist Tom Steyer ($47 million to gain 0.6 points).\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump greets Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, before he speaks in Council Bluffs, Iowa, in June. (Photo: Patrick Semansky/AP) More\n\nVulnerable GOP senators get bad polling news\n\nA new round of polling shows some Republican senators could be facing reelection headwinds in 2020. According to a Morning Consult survey of battleground states, freshman Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, had the biggest fall, tumbling 9 points to negative 4 approval since a similar survey from the second quarter of the year. Not helping Ernst is Trump\u2019s approval rating in the state, which is 16 points underwater. Ernst also posted lackluster third-quarter fundraising results that came in under the haul of one potential Democratic opponent. Ernst, however, maintains a large cash-on-hand advantage, with nearly $4 million.\n\nOther Republican senators who saw their approval ratings fall were Maine\u2019s Susan Collins (down 2 points to negative 6), North Carolina\u2019s Thom Tillis (down 3 to negative 6) and Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner (down 3 to negative 6). Arizona\u2019s Martha McSally, who lost a 2018 Senate race before being appointed to her seat, is still above water in terms of her approval rating but saw a 1-point decline. Should the House decide to impeach Trump, all three would be faced with potential lose-lose votes in which they are forced to either condemn the president (and alienate his base) or vote to acquit (and potentially turn off independents in states where Trump is unpopular). The poll wasn\u2019t all bad news for Republicans. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas stayed even at 18.\n\nThe two Democratic senators polled in the race \u2014 Doug Jones of Alabama and Gary Peters of Michigan \u2014 saw slight increases in their approval ratings, although Jones remains an underdog in a state where Trump's approval rating stands at 17.\n\nPost debate poll shows little change\n\nSupport among Democratic primary voters, Oct. 16, 2019. (Survey results courtesy Morning Consult) More\n\nThe first national poll taken after Tuesday's Democratic primary debate shows virtually no change in the race. According to the survey, conducted by Morning Consult on Wednesday, Joe Biden (31 percent) continues to hold a 10-point lead over Warren (21 percent), with Sanders (18 percent) in third. Harris (7 percent) and Buttigieg (6 percent) round out the top five.\n\nLast week, the same poll showed each of the candidates with basically the same support, with movement limited to a single percentage point within the survey's 2-point margin of error. Support for Elizabeth Warren, who took the brunt of the attacks from her rivals onstage at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, was literally unchanged from a week ago.\n\nThe data from Morning Consult also suggests that the last two debates have had little effect on the race.\n\nHarris, who saw a spike in support after the first debate, \u201cended the fourth debate essentially where she began the summer,\u201d Morning Consult noted, while support for Sanders and Buttigieg has not changed.\n\n(Morning Consult) More\n\nMorning Consult More\n\nButtigieg has, however, gained ground in Iowa. A new Emerson poll released this week found him in third place (with 18 percent) behind Biden and Warren (tied for first with 23 percent) and ahead of Sanders (with 13 percent), who has slipped to fourth among likely caucus-goers.\n\nThe same survey, taken in March, had Mayor Pete in fourth place, with 11 percent support.\n\nComing up\n\nSaturday, Oct. 19: Sanders will hold his first rally since his heart attack, in Queens, N.Y., where he is expected to be endorsed by Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nSunday, Oct. 20: Buttigieg will appear on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d and CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nTuesday, Oct. 22: Bill Taylor, acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, will testify in the House Democrats\u2019 ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nFriday, Oct. 25: Trump and at least nine Democratic presidential hopefuls \u2014 Biden, Warren, Sanders, Buttigieg, Harris, Booker, Klobuchar, Castro and Delaney \u2014 will appear at a criminal justice forum at Benedict College in Columbia, S.C.\n\nSen.
