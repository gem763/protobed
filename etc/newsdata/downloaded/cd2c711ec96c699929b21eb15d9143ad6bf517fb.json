It was part of the rift between China's government and the league \u2014 started by a since-deleted tweet from Houston general manager Daryl Morey that supported anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nThe U.S. and Chinese national anthems were not played before the game. All media events Thursday at Mercedes-Benz Arena \u2014 including pregame availabilities, postgame news conferences and a long-scheduled media session with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver \u2014 were canceled.\n\nBut fans came in droves, nearly every seat in the 18,000-seat arena appeared filled and they cheered for James loudest of all \u2014 as usual. James has made almost-annual visits to China during his NBA career to promote the game and his personal brand, and his popularity there is enormous.\n\nGiven fan reaction to James there this week, including being mobbed by well-wishers who chanted and snapped countless pictures with their phones as he walked through a Shanghai mall on Wednesday, not even the politically charged unrest between China and the NBA could dampen how revered he is in the world's most populous country.\n\nIt was a topic again in Tokyo on Thursday, where Houston and Toronto finished their two-game series. The Rockets, of course, have been at the forefront of the rift between China and the league because of Morey's tweet.\n\n\"You know what? It's a tough situation,\" Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni said after Houston's 118-111 win over the reigning NBA champion Raptors. \"Very difficult. Adam Silver speaks for the NBA. I work for the NBA. I go with Adam. Commissioner Silver will do the right thing.\"\n\nIrving tried to play through his left-side facial fracture, an injury that occurred in a pickup game last month. He was wearing a clear mask in an effort to protect his face, but bumped into Rondo while playing defense just 1:06 into the contest.\n\nIrving's face made contact with Rondo's upper arm. The Nets guard immediately winced in pain, took the mask off and motioned to the bench that he needed a substitute.\n\nIf that wasn't concern enough, the Nets lost their other starting guard just 22 seconds later. Caris LeVert left with 10:32 remaining in the first quarter after being poked in the eye and didn't return.\n\nJames made 7 of 15 shots, including 2 of 3 from 3-point range and added six rebounds in 24 1/2 minutes. The Lakers and Nets play again Saturday in Shenzhen, China.\n\nThere are five games later Thursday: Oklahoma City plays host to the New Zealand Breakers, Portland hosts Maccabi Haifa, Phoenix is at Sacramento, Minnesota goes to Golden State and Denver visits the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nROCKETS 118, RAPTORS 111\n\nIn Tokyo, Russell Westbrook and James Harden each scored 22 points to lead Houston.\n\nNeither of the Rockets' starting guards shot particularly well \u2014 combined, they were 13 of 33 from the field and 4 for 19 from 3-point range \u2014 and Harden missed his last six 3-point attempts. But the Rockets started fast, getting out to a 22-8 lead, and then overcame a 13-point second-half deficit after both sides pulled most of their starters.\n\nAnd the fans \u2014 more than 20,000 in Tokyo \u2014 loved what they saw from the former MVPs, regaling them both with \"M-V-P\" chants.\n\n\"It feels great anytime you hear those chants. Both of us have accomplished that unbelievable goal, being MVP,\" Harden said. \"I think the reason that we're here together is to accomplish something bigger than that. Obviously, it's going to take time but we're in the right direction, right steps. We have a long season ahead of us and I think we're all excited for it.\"\n\nEric Gordon scored 14 points for Houston.\n\nNorman Powell scored 22 for Toronto, which got 16 points from Pascal Siakam and a 10-point, 10-assist double-double from Fred VanVleet.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
