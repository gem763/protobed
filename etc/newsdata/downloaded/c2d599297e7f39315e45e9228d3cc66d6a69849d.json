I\u2019ve lived in Japan for seven years and have been dating the same Japanese man for four years\u2014living together for two. We have a great relationship. We go out to events regularly, see movies together, we\u2019re like any other couple.\n\nDuring the last year, our sex life has gotten out of control. We go through these roller coasters of either having sex all the time or having none at all. Right now we\u2019re in the middle of a month-long dry spell. Neither of us has any physical issues (perfect health checks this year!). We both work long hours like everybody else, but otherwise, we are fine.\n\nWhen things are good, we both initiate and have no trouble functioning, but then it\u2019s like we get tired of sex. For me, I start feeling like sex gets boring and I don\u2019t want to be the one to initiate. Then I guess my boyfriend gets tired of initiating, and we just stop having sex. When we aren\u2019t having sex we\u2019re still close but then we get frustrated, have these huge fights, and then have make up sex, and start a new cycle all over again.\n\nI\u2019m tired of dealing with this. I know it\u2019s not healthy, but when I talk to my married friends they say that it\u2019s just normal for sex to drop off, or they tell me that in Japan sexless marriages are normal. I don\u2019t want that, and I don\u2019t think my boyfriend does either. How do I break this cycle? Is there something either of us can do to even things out again? \u2013 Sorta Sexless In Tokyo\n\nDear Sexless In Tokyo,\n\nJudging from your email alone, it sounds like you both are attracted to each other and are capable of initiating and enjoying sex. But, you said that eventually \u201csex gets boring\u201d and you don\u2019t want to initiate, which means if your boyfriend doesn\u2019t initiate it, it doesn\u2019t happen. It sounds like you\u2019re both getting stuck in the same old routine of sex\u2014in other words, you have established a certain rhythm that is easy and satisfying in the moment, but gets boring quickly.\n\nOne way to resolve this requires two discussions: one with yourself and one with your partner.\n\nClick here to read more.\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://savvytokyo.com/\n\n\u00a9 Savvy Tokyo", "description": "Savvy Tokyo's resident \"Love in Japan\" columnist, Hilary Keyes, answers anonymous questions from readers on everything from dating in Japan to women\u2019s health issues.
