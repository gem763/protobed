The future her child will grow up in there is uncertain to say the least, as the loosening of authoritarian control imposed by half a century of military dictatorship has unleashed fierce sectarian clashes in the region.\n\nRohingya Muslim children play at a camp for people displaced by violence, not far from the Rakhine State capital Sittwe. Clashes between Rohingya Muslims and Rakhine Buddhists in June and October 2012 killed at least 192 people and caused some 140,000 to flee. Most of the dead and homeless were Muslims. In the sand dunes and barren paddy fields outside Sittwe, emergency shelters set up for Rohingya Muslims last year have become permanent, prison-like ghettos. Muslims are stopped from leaving at gunpoint, aid workers are threatened and camps seethe with anger and disease.\n\nRohingya Muslims look through the gates of a house in a village where many of those who fled violence found shelter. The Rohingya are an impoverished and long-persecuted people, who are denied citizenship by the government in Myanmar and considered immigrants from Bangladesh, even though many have lived in Rakhine state for generations.\n\nWaadulae, a 16-year-old Rohingya Muslim boy with severe symptoms of rabies, has a stick wedged between his teeth to stop him from biting off his tongue. He is lying at a local clinic that serves about 85,300 displaced people, almost all of them Muslims who lost their homes in fighting with Buddhist mobs last year. Wadulae was bitten on the leg by a rabid dog, and clinic officials said he had a slim chance of surviving. Swift treatment might have saved him, but it was not available at this primitive hospital, where there are no doctors, painkillers or vaccines.", "description": "Roma Hattu goes into labour as she lies on the floor of a former rubber factory, which now serves as her family's shelter after they were displaced by ethnic violence.", "authors": ["Damir Sagolj"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ0kx-IJGvFaX6wEOWNHtoayk6erlANLd72lb7OotjtXe7roNmRCYmxlvB-zsHtTBaXN_5ZqgbKm7_E-DtcP02P1Q0AGZspPRC6Mqj0sI2AAy"}
