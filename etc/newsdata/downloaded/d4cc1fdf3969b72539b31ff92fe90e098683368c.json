The Vermont independent is three years older than former Vice President Joe Biden, who has led most national and state primary polls despite concerns about his mental sharpness.\n\n\"Sen. Sanders is conversing and in good spirits. He will be resting up over the next few days,\" Weaver said. \"We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates.\"\n\nIn a statement, the campaign advisor Jeff Weaver said Sanders \"experienced some chest discomfort\" during an event Tuesday. Tests found a \"blockage in one artery,\" and Sanders had two stents inserted, he said.\n\nPresidential hopeful Bernie Sanders on Wednesday canceled all appearances until further notice after the 78-year-old senator underwent surgery for an artery blockage.\n\nDemocratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speaks during a rally at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center October 3, 2015 in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nSanders is five years older than the 73-year-old Trump, who is the oldest person to be elected as a first-term president.\n\nA stent is a tiny wire mesh tube that props open an artery and is left there permanently, according to the American Heart Association. Coronary arteries clogged by fatty plaque can reduce blood flow to the heart, causing chest pain and possible heart attacks if the blood flow is completely blocked.\n\nThe senator had committed to releasing his medical records before the primary voting contests started. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Sanders released a letter from his doctor saying the senator was in good health and did not have a history of heart disease.\n\nThe Sanders campaign appears to have started canceling a $1.3 million ad buy in the first-in-the-nation nominating state of Iowa, according to NBC News. It only announced the television ad on Tuesday. It was unclear if the apparent cancellation was related to Sanders' health.\n\nThe senator's Democratic primary competitors sent him messages of support after his campaign announced the procedure. In tweets, frontrunner Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Cory Booker, D-N.J., and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg wished Sanders a \"speedy recovery.\"\n\nSanders has run for president promising a drastic political and economic overhaul. He has proposed plans including implementing a single-payer \"Medicare for All\" health care system, canceling all student debt and taxing the wealthy at higher rates.\n\nSanders is considered one of the top contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination. He has polled among the top three candidates in the vast majority of national and early state primary surveys.\n\nOn Tuesday, his campaign said it raised $25.3 million in the third quarter, a haul that will allow him to stay competitive in the primary contest well into next year.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report", "description": "Sen.
