Two thirds received less than 8 Megabits per second (Mbps). Yet for this \"no guarantees\" service you typically paid $110 a month in today\u2019s dollars including monthly line rental.\n\nToday the NBN is rapidly becoming the dominant fixed line access network. Two thirds of NBN\u2019s fixed line customers take 50 Mbps plans or higher; and the typical cost of a 50 Mbps plan is $80 a month.\n\nTen years ago there were monthly download limits and customers on average downloaded 11 gigabytes a month; today there are no download limits on most NBN retail plans and the average fixed-line NBN customer downloads 255 gigabytes a month.\n\nAustralians are getting much faster broadband, downloading vastly more, and paying a lot less, than 10 years ago.\n\nOf course the flip side of Australians paying less is that Telstra makes much less profit from broadband and other local loop services today.\n\nThis reflects a decision by Telstra during the Labor government years to enter into the \"Definitive Agreements\" with NBN Co - under which Telstra would gradually cease operating its local loop network and transition across to being a reseller of NBN services.\n\nTelstra\u2019s chairman suggests that if other telcos were free to build out their networks in competition with NBN Co, that would deliver lower wholesale prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf he is referring to the fact that Telstra is restricted from doing this, it is important to recognise that this arises under the Definitive Agreements.\n\nTelstra voluntarily contracted with NBN, in the years when Labor was in government, to accept this restriction \u2013 in exchange for a stream of payments that will continue for at least 35 years from commencement, and which this year will see Telstra receive around $1 billion a year in nominal terms from NBN Co for lease payments.\n\nIn nominal terms NBN Co will also pay Telstra and Optus about $10 billion for all customers connecting to the fixed line NBN from legacy networks.\n\nIf Telstra\u2019s chairman is referring to other telcos building networks to compete with NBN, there is nothing in the legislation that prevents this.\n\nNor is there any restriction on Telstra and other mobile operators using their 4G or their emerging 5G networks to compete against the NBN.\n\nOur Liberal-National government is clear \u2013 we would not have designed the NBN in the way that Labor did.\n\nSo I would certainly agree with Telstra\u2019s chairman that a better strategy might well have seen much of the network upgrade funded by the private sector (although not, as he rightly concedes, in regional and remote Australia).\n\nAustralia could for example have followed a similar approach to New Zealand \u2013 where the equivalent company to Telstra was split into two separate entities, and the network-owning company (now Chorus) upgraded its access network to deliver high speed broadband services (100 Mbps and beyond) with the aid of government subsidies (concessional loans not grants).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course history shows that under earlier boards and managements, Telstra was fiercely opposed to such industry transformation.\n\nAnd it is also a matter of historical record that when our Liberal-National government took office in 2013, Labor had locked in the model we inherited. It had spent $6.5 billion on the NBN, entered contracts to spend many billions of dollars more \u2013 and had connected barely 50,000 premises to the fixed-line network.\n\nWe judged that the best course of action for the nation was to complete the rollout as quickly as possible \u2013 and by moving away from Labor\u2019s ill-judged plans to our multitechnology mix the NBN will be delivered for $30 billion less, and four years earlier than under Labor\u2019s plans.\n\nToday over 10 million premises can connect, over 6 million premises are connected, and by next year the rollout will be complete with 11.5 million premises able to connect.\n\nThat has happened with a lot of hard work from NBN Co \u2013 and from its key resellers such as Telstra.\n\nIt is undeniable that today\u2019s broadband business model is less profitable for Telstra than 10 years ago. It is also undeniable that Telstra\u2019s board and management freely entered into the deal that has led to today\u2019s outcome.\n\nThe most important public policy question is whether broadband consumers are better off \u2013 and the answer unambiguously is yes.\n\nPaul Fletcher is the federal minister for communications, cybersafety and the arts.", "description": "The telco makes lower profits from broadband -- and consumers are better off.
