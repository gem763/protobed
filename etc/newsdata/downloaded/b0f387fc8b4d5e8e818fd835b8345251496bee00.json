It started hearing arguments yesterday in three blockbuster cases concerning LGBT job discrimination. In each case, the judges are basically pondering whether the word \u201csex\u201d in Title VII \u2013 the section of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that prohibits employment discrimination \u2013 extends to sexual orientation and gender identity. At present, Title VII prohibits an employer from firing someone on the basis of \u201crace, color, religion, sex and national origin\u201d.\n\nThese cases are, to put it mildly, a huge deal \u2013 and not just for LGBT people. The ruling will have serious implications for straight people who don\u2019t comply with gender norms. It could allow employers to fire women who don\u2019t wear heels or makeup. It could allow companies to discriminate against men who are not considered manly enough. It could give employers a green light to act as the gender police.\n\nIn 1989, the supreme court heard the case Price Waterhouse v Hopkins, in which the plaintiff said she had been denied a promotion because her employer thought she was \u201ctoo macho\u201d. In its ruling, the court said it was illegal to discriminate against someone for failing to conform to gender stereotypes. But this decision could in effect be overturned if the court finds sex protections don\u2019t extend to gay or trans people. After all, as articulated in another case, homosexuality is \u201cthe ultimate case of failure to conform\u201d to gender stereotypes.\n\nPerhaps you don\u2019t live in the US. Perhaps you think none of this affects you. Well, you are wrong. The wide-ranging implications of the supreme court\u2019s decision in these cases should serve as a reminder that we can\u2019t draw a line between feminism and the fight for gay liberation or trans equality. LGBT rights are human rights \u2013 we are all in this together.\n\n\u2022Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The pending supreme court verdict on whether gay and trans people are protected from job discrimination has wide-reaching consequences for everyone, says Arwa Mahdawi", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/08/lgbt_5x3.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1c25a35787afe086ac09d9111fd34903", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
