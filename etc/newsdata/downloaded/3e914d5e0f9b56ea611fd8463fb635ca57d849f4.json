Earlier this year, the House passed some new gun control measures, but that legislation has not been taken up by the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\n\"I spoke to her about guns yesterday. She didn't even know what I was talking about,\" Trump said of Pelosi. \"All she's thinking about is [impeachment]. She's been taken over by the radical left, the whole Democrat Party.\"\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi, as far as I'm concerned, is no longer the speaker of the House,\" he concluded, suggesting she had ceded her authority over the House to the far left of her party.\n\nMore: Trump administration releases details of call with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy amid impeachment inquiry\n\nThe president's comments came during a press conference that was part of a bilateral meeting with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nPelosi said Tuesday that the House was going to open an inquiry after reports of a June call between Trump and Zelensky where the president asked Ukraine to look into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who had some business dealings with a Ukrainian company. The White House on Wednesday released a memo of the call where Trump pressed Zelensky to re-open an investigation into a Ukrainian energy company to focus on any involvement by Joe and Hunter Biden.\n\n\"The president must be held accountable. No one is above the law,\" Pelosi said Tuesday.\n\nMore: Read the summary of President Trump's call with Ukraine president about Biden\n\nDuring the Wednesday press conference, Zelensky told journalists that he did not want to get involved with U.S. elections and that he didn't feel pressured by Trump to pursue any investigations into the Biden family.\n\nZelensky also told reporters that his country's top prosecutorial authority is independent and he couldn't have asked anyone to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.\n\n\"We have independent country and we have independent general security,\" Zelensky said. \"I can't push anyone. I couldn't call somebody... I didn't ask him, I didn't push him.\"\n\nContributing: Kevin Johnson, David Jackson, Bart Jansen, Christal Hayes and Maureen Groppe\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Donald Trump: Nancy Pelosi 'taken over by the radical left'", "description": "President Donald Trump's comments come a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House was going to open an impeachment inquiry into the president.", "authors": ["Rebecca Morin", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_Lv37h35qW6gLW44nh3v5w--~B/aD0zMjAwO3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/a764d4039eb128e2b09646b98dc0bd5a", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
