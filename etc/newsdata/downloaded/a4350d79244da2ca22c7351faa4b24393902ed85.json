The event celebrates Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was first elected in 2014 and is credited with modernizing India\u2019s economy and addressing climate change. But his military moves in the Kashmir region are controversial, and protesters are expected outside the stadium for him and President Trump.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nThe Commander-in-Tweet also found time this morning to give a shout-out to The Mothman, a West Virginia legend that purportedly shows up just before major disasters. They\u2019re celebrating the creature today with a festival in that state.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s tweetstorm also criticized the Federal Reserve for its interest rate policies, and again raised the Hunter Biden flag as he continues his counter-attack on the whistleblower rumors.\n\nWe\u2019ll monitor the postings and update as needed.

It is a false hoax.\u201d @MZHemingway @MediaBuzzFNC Zero people were fired at the Times. Why? \u2014 Donald J.
