You\u2019re obviously an intelligent person, a compassionate person and a socially conscious person. At this point in your life and career, it\u2019s part of your brand. But to present that face to an American audience while essentially admitting that all you care about when it comes to the rest of the world is cashing those big checks \u2014 well, let\u2019s just say it doesn\u2019t look very good on you.\n\nMaybe you don\u2019t know it, but your news conference on Monday night played right into the hands of Chinese government propaganda and undermined the values you espouse in other facets of your life and public persona.\n\nSurely you are aware of this, LeBron, but in the United States it\u2019s considered a good thing to exercise your freedom of expression in support of a just cause because you\u2019ve done that yourself on numerous occasions.\n\nNot supporting other Americans who exercise that same freedom because it might personally inconvenience you for a few days overseas, LeBron, is without question the most disgraceful moment of your career.", "description": "", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Usatoday.Com Story Sports Columnist Dan-Wolken Lebron-James-Daryl-Morey-China-Hong-Kong-Tweet"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
