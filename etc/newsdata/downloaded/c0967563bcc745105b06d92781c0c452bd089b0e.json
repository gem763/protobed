This review comes from the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\n\u201cThis is fucking wild!\u201d a wounded yakuza member bellows to no one in particular, deep into the heart of Takashi Miike\u2019s latest action-thriller, First Love. And he certainly isn\u2019t wrong. The line may read like a self-congratulatory bit of meta-commentary, like Miike and screenwriter Masaru Nakamura praising themselves for the sheer extremity of the situation they\u2019ve gotten their characters into. By the time he delivers the line, Miike and Nakamura have already crammed the film with warring Japanese gangs, a modern-day samurai, a ruthless assassin, an escaped sex slave, a one-armed triad boss, a huge bag of drugs, and a lot more excuses for bloody confrontations.\n\nBut given that the character delivers the line from the back seat of a wildly spinning vehicle that\u2019s being chased by both the yakuza and a triad, and that he\u2019s bleeding out while covered from head to toe in meth, it\u2019s also a pretty relatable moment. The film is fucking wild, in the most joyously excessive and ridiculous kind of way, and the audience is likely to feel the exact same emotions he\u2019s expressing.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE GENRE?\n\nCrime thriller. Miike has worked in a wide variety of genres, from the gruesome body horror (and social commentary) of Audition to the farcical musical comedy of The Happiness of the Katakuris to the traditional children\u2019s fantasy of The Great Yokai War. But he often returns to the underworld of his native Japan, where clashes between yakuza factions, between law enforcement agents and criminals, or between foreigners and home-grown gangsters all provide rich opportunities for the extreme violence that made him famous. In spite of the tender title, First Love isn\u2019t primarily focused on romance. It\u2019s more about corruption, betrayal, and clashing agendas between amoral characters who are all doggedly chasing the same payout.\n\nWHAT\u2019S IT ABOUT?\n\nIt takes a while for First Love to come into focus, because there are so many characters to introduce, and it\u2019s initially unclear which ones matter, and which ones are bullet fodder. But a few eventually emerge as key to the story: Monica (Sakurako Konishi) is an addict paying off her father\u2019s debts with sex work, while accumulating her own debts to her abusive pimps, Yasu (Takahiro Miura) and his Western girlfriend Julie (credited only as \u201cBecky\u201d). Yasu and Julie are in the middle of a big drug deal for a yakuza group, but one of the yakuza, Kase (Sh\u00f4ta Sometani) has drawn corrupt cop Otomo (Nao Ohmori) into an plan to steal and resell the drugs, and frame Monica. Meanwhile, a young up-and-coming boxer, Leo (Masataka Kubota) is informed that he has a brain tumor, his boxing career is over, and he doesn\u2019t have long to live.\n\nFirst Love\u2019s title comes from the relationship between Monica and Leo, who meet under stressful circumstances and form a bond that initially means everything to her, and not much to him. She initially looks like a fairly standard crime-picture damsel in distress, too meek and damaged to be a femme fatale, but just as capable of drawing a hero into a deadly conflict. But the meat of the film isn\u2019t really in their relationship \u2014 it\u2019s in Kase\u2019s ambition, Julie\u2019s outsized rage once the plot kicks into gear, Otomo\u2019s weaselly behavior, and the way the stakes ramp up when the Chinese triad boss also takes an interest in Yasu\u2019s stash.\n\nWHAT\u2019S IT REALLY ABOUT?\n\nFirst Love is more about outsized characters and big action than subtle themes, but on some level, it\u2019s certainly about how connection defines people, and how new connections can help people escape old nightmares. Without entirely realizing what he\u2019s doing, Leo helps Monica find a way through her history of abuse. In less positive developments, Kase and Otomo pull each other away from their respective organizations, and toward betrayals that set everyone on a much more dangerous path. Nearly everyone in the movie is trying for a come-up, but only the people who show some loyalty and selflessness have a chance of actually surviving where their new connections put them.\n\nIS IT GOOD?\n\nIt\u2019s a blast. Some of Miike\u2019s crime dramas can be humorless, dour, or overwhelmingly gory \u2014 he\u2019s an extremely prolific director, sometimes averaging four films per year, and he\u2019s worked in a lot of different modes. But he has a notable streak of dark humor as well, and it frequently emerges in First Love. Many of the characters are oversized stereotypes, like the honor-bound yakuza member who carries a katana and once cut the arm off a member of the triad that\u2019s gunning for his crew. It says something that their mortal enmity \u2014 with the triad member emerging from prison with bloody vengeance on his mind \u2014 barely rates as a minor sub-subplot in this crowded narrative.\n\nBut part of First Love\u2019s humor is in the use of familiar types doing familiar things in particularly grandiose ways. Their face-off, teased throughout the film, reads a bit like a gag because it feels like something more suited to a samurai epic than a gangland picture. But when it finally comes, it\u2019s thrilling.\n\nLeo and Monica\u2019s budding romance is treated more seriously, but not in a particularly sentimental way. She\u2019s damaged and needy; he\u2019s a bit of a gentle dope, spending most of the movie fairly removed from the action because he\u2019s still processing his diagnosis. It takes a fairly extreme crisis to wake him up to what\u2019s going on around him. Their relationship isn\u2019t entirely satisfying \u2014 her weakness and his blankness are both detriments to the story \u2014 but it does lead to one of the film\u2019s most striking visual and emotional moments, as Leo inadvertently gives her a new way to look at the specter of her sexually abusive father.\n\nMostly, though, First Love is the kind of film that\u2019s designed for seen-it-all genre fans who know these tropes (the scheming criminal, the dewy ingenues, the cold-hearted lady assassin, and so on) and appreciate seeing them tweaked in new directions, and treated with an air of fond familiarity rather than dour airlessness. First Love isn\u2019t a comedy, but it piles up the abrupt surprises and \u201cI can\u2019t believe that just happened\u201d laughs. Miike doesn\u2019t treat any of the storylines here particularly seriously, but he does create a significant tension around how it\u2019ll all come out in the end. The film is troubled in some ways \u2014 it\u2019s so overcrowded that it\u2019s initially hard to tell the characters apart or sort out their agendas, and the buildup is much messier than the payoff. But it\u2019s all worth it for that end result, which is, inevitably, fucking wild.\n\nWHAT SHOULD IT BE RATED?\n\nHard R. While not as graphically violent as some of Miike\u2019s more exceptional work, it\u2019s set in a world where criminals go after each other with guns, knives, and sometimes swords, and the results are messy.\n\nHOW CAN I ACTUALLY WATCH IT?\n\nFirst Love opens in limited theatrical release in New York City and Los Angeles on September 27th, and will enter wide release on October 4th.
