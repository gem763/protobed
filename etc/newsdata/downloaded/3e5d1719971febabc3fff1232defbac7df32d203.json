Let people see it \u2014 that's up to the attorney general.\"\n\nFederal law requires Mueller to present Attorney General William Barr with a confidential report upon the completion of his work.\n\nBy an overwhelming vote last week, the House called on Barr to release whatever report Mueller submits to the Justice Department.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing in January, Barr said his goal \"will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law,\" regarding Mueller's final report, but stopped short of promising to release it.\n\nTrump again on Wednesday insisted, \"There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no nothing.\"\n\nHe added, \"I want to see the report, and you know who will want to see it? The tens of millions of people that love the fact that we have the greatest economy that we have ever had.\"\n\nTrump also criticized, although not by name, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia probe, leaving Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to oversee Mueller's work. Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, to conduct the investigation. On Wednesday, Trump said that Sessions \"didn't have the courage to do it himself\" and said that it was interesting \"that a man out of the blue just writes a report,\" before again recalling his Electoral College victory in 2016.\n\nThere has been increasing speculation that Mueller has nearly completed his investigation. The Justice Department had no comment on Trump's remarks, and Barr was spotted eating his lunch with senior aides at the Justice Department cafeteria.\n\nNPR National Justice Correspondent Carrie Johnson contributed to this report.", "description": "The president told reporters, \"Let people see\" special counsel Robert Mueller's report, as Trump again denied any collusion with Russia prior to his election in 2016.", "authors": ["Brian Naylor"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/03/20/ap_19079596003014_wide-70a543909d670abebcb052ad20fdcd5f7be27e14.jpg?s=1400"}
