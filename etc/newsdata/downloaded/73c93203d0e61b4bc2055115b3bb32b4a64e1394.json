First off, perusing the wares was like taking a trip to my early 20s \u2014 when, as a young editor at Paper magazine, my colleagues would take \u201corders\u201d from us before heading to the press previews, go wild, and return with bags and bags of cardigans, beach towels, and sweater dresses that they doled out to us like Santa Claus. I\u2019ve lost track of a lot of my loot (where, oh where, did my striped Jason Wu for Target dress go?), but I still wear my Missoni for Target cardigan (it\u2019s the one Cate Blanchett\u2019s character wears throughout Blue Jasmine!) on a biweekly basis. The goods go on sale this Saturday, and we imagine that pretty much the whole shebang will sell out within minutes (at least the good stuff), so we\u2019ve rounded up the things we\u2019re particularly excited about, and the pages you may want to bookmark.\n\nJohn Derian for Target Melamine Wastebasket Animal Print $20 at Target Buy\n\nJohn Derian for Target Melamine Serving Tray with Handles Floral Print $20 at Target Buy\n\nMarimekko for Target 4pk 20\"x20\" Cotton Napkin Set White/Black $10 at Target Buy\n\nProenza Schouler for Target Women's Long Sleeve Bomber Jacket $30 at Target Buy\n\nHunter for Target Large Tote Bag, Olive $35 at Target Buy\n\nMissoni for Target Women's Colore Zig Zag Long Sleeve V-Neck Button-Front Cardigan $55 at Target Buy\n\nMissoni for Target Toddler Girls' Colore Zig Zag Sleeveless Crewneck Sweater Dress $30 at Target Buy\n\nJason Wu for Target Women's Striped Sleeveless Collared Pleated Shift Mini Dress $40 at Target Buy\n\nThakoon for Target Shibori Print Long Sleeve V-Neck Cardigan $35 at Target Buy\n\nLilly Pulitzer for Target Plus Size Nosey Posie Sleeveless Round Neck Shift Mini Dress $38 at Target Buy\n\n3.1 Phillip Lim for Target Leopard Print Drawstring Carryall Bag $40 at Target Buy\n\nZac Posen for Target Floral Print Sleeveless Brocade Mini Dress $60 at Target Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
