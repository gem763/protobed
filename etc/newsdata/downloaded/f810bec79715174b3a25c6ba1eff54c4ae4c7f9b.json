He used the example of an investor with seven properties worth a combined $2.5 million to $3 million being currently able to avoid land tax. \"How is that fair?,'' Mr Lucas said.\n\nThe land tax overhaul, which faces a difficult route through state parliament because of hostile crossbenchers in the upper house, will change aggregation rules to bring South Australia into line with other states.\n\nSouth Australian Labor leader Peter Malinauskas said on Tuesday the Labor Party would opposed the revamped measures because they would hurt the economy and drive up rents.\n\n\"Landlords have also sent a clear message, if their land tax bill goes up so will their rents,'' Mr Malinauskas.\n\nSA-Best's Frank Pangallo, one of the upper house crossbenchers vowing to block the latest measures, said the handling of the whole issue by Mr Lucas and his party had been ''appalling''.\n\nMr Lucas said tax reform was difficult, and if the measures failed to pass the parliament, no government of any persuasion would attempt such changes for decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I can guarantee that if this package is not passed, no government, Labor or Liberal will go anywhere near comprehensive land tax reform for the next twenty of thirty years,'' he said.\n\nThe top rate of land tax in South Australia will drop from 3.7 per cent to 2.4 per cent under the changes, which is equal to the average of Australia's mainland states.\n\nThe tax-free threshold will rise to $450,000.\n\nMr Lucas said the latest negotiations would mean the state government would forego an extra $20 million in land tax collections over the three years starting from July 1, 2020.\n\nThe total reduction in land tax collections by the SA government under the revamped land tax package is $90 million over three years.", "description": "Big investors won't be able to use complex trusts and company structures to avoid land tax in SA, as a package is overhauled for a third time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6229%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_148%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ec6d72d5c10a2fb8ddd4dd2618e43f9d24073cd1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
