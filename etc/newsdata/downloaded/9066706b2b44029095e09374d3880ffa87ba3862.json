The tech sector led gains after Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nManufacturing Co (TSMC) on Thursday raised its 2019\n\ncapital spending plan by up to $5 billion and forecast a nearly\n\n10% rise in fourth-quarter revenue on strong demand for faster\n\nmobile chips and new high-end smartphones.\n\nScreen Holdings , a major chip industry supplier,\n\ngained 8.9% in heavy trade while Sumco rose 4.6%.\n\nMurata Manufacturing gained 1.3%, while robot maker\n\nFanuc soared 3.4% and Keyence rose 1.5%.\n\nOn top of the Brexit deal, U.S. corporate earnings have so\n\nfar mostly beat market expectations. .N\n\nThat also raised some hopes that Japanese companies'\n\nearnings outlook could bottom out soon.
