Speaking to viewers, she admitted that she was attempting to clear her home out and offload her belongings on eBay \u2013 which might take her longer than she first thought.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, she did little to dispel the mucky rumours as she spoke to the camera against a white wall, covered in colourful drawings and crayon squiggles.\n\nOver here you\u2019ll see priceless Banksy murals (Picture: YouTube / Katie Price)\n\nWhich may be what Kerry was on about.\n\nWriting in her column for new! magazine, the 39-year-old Atomic Kitten singer said: \u2018Seeing Katie Price\u2019s mucky mansion made me realise I live in a bloody palace!\n\n\u2018You know I love Kate, but looking at all that stuff all over the floor in different rooms gave me anxiety!\n\n\u2018Kate\u2019s like me \u2013 she\u2019s given a lot of free things and it is tricky to know what to do with it all.\n\nMy name is Kate and I shall be your tour guide (Picture: YouTube / Katie Price)\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t envy her having to sort through that lot!\u2019\n\nThis is hardly the first time Kerry has been honest about her thoughts on her one-time frenemy, as she recently said she thought Katie had \u2018crossed the line\u2019 with her facelift and admitted the last time she saw the Loose Women star, before the operation, she thought some of her features looked \u2018weird\u2019.\n\n\u2018Seeing pictures of my friend Katie Price after her recent surgery was pretty awful. Those wounds!\u2019 she wrote.\n\n\u2018And her ears look really big. I imagine they\u2019re swollen from where the face gets pulled up, but, that said, the last time I saw her they looked weird.\n\n\u2018I love Kate to bits but I think she\u2019s crossed the line.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, such comments are going to cut and it was then claimed Katie was upset by her pal\u2019s remarks.\n\nKerry later insisted they\u2019ll always be \u2018great friends\u2019, no matter how critical they are of one another.\n\n\u2018Katie called me up straight away to assure me she never said [she was upset],\u2019 Kerry said. \u2018She told me she loves me, she misses me, that we\u2019re indestructible and nothing could destroy our friendship.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re planning on meeting up in a few weeks when I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have a good laugh about the rumours.\n\n\u2018The bottom line is, me and Kate are great friends. There\u2019s no big fallout. We\u2019ve always been brutally honest with each other and we both know how this industry works.\u2019\n\nBut seems you won\u2019t get Kerry around for a cup of tea in your place any time soon, Katie.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
