He clearly gets a kick out of producing new beers like this \u2013 and other drinks. Earlier this year he fermented some gamay grapes from two different NSW vineyards in barrels in his Marrickville cask hall, using his house culture. \u201cI suppose in many ways I\u2019m really a frustrated winemaker,\u201d he says, smiling.\n\nA growing number of Australian craft brewers are taking their cues from the world of wine in an attempt to capture a unique sense of place in their beers. And for me, this adventurous, wilder, outer edge of the modern craft scene is where the most interesting and satisfying drinks can be found.\n\nBen Kraus is one of the country\u2019s most experienced beer makers, with 14 years at the helm of Bridge Road Brewers in Beechworth, north-east Victoria. Most of Bridge Road\u2019s output is high-quality regular craft beer fare: pale ale, IPA, porter. But Kraus has always been a few steps ahead of the game when it comes to also producing less mainstream, more adventurous beers. In the mid-2000s, for example, he was one of the first Australian brewers to release a saison-style farmhouse ale, called Chevalier, modelled on those traditionally brewed from local ingredients in rural Belgium and France.\n\nKraus has a background in wine; he studied viticulture at university. And he has used his connections in the Beechworth wine industry to make a trio of outstanding, distinctive ales based on the saison style but fermented with the yeast lees collected from barrels of fermenting chardonnay.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had robust discussions with my winemaker mates about yeast,\u201d says Kraus. \u201cWe brewers put a really high priority on the yeast culture we select for each brew. It can contribute a huge amount, 30 or 40 per cent, to the finished character of the beer. But the wines I prefer to drink are wild fermented: the winemaker doesn\u2019t add a selected yeast culture, like we brewers do, but just lets the yeasts on the grapes and in the cellar ferment the juice naturally. And wine people really value that.\u201d\n\nRestaurants harp on all the time about the provenance of their produce. I want people to start thinking about beer the same way. \u2014 Will Tatchell, Van Dieman Brewing\n\nSo, during the 2018 vintage, Kraus filled three barrels with wort and added active yeast lees from three different local chardonnay producers \u2013 Giaconda, A.Rodda and Sorrenberg \u2013 and matured each barrel of beer for a further 12 months before bottling. The results are delicious: all three beers are quite different from the \u201ccontrol\u201d saison, Chevalier, brewed with Belgian saison yeast, and each is different from the other. Wine people have a word for this, of course, for drinks that taste of where they\u2019re from: we\u2019d say that these beers display distinctive Beechworth terroir.\n\nTerroir isn\u2019t a word you hear a lot in beer circles. Yes, many beers are historically associated with the places and regions where they evolved. The pilsner style of lager, for example, was first brewed in the Czech town of Pilsen in the early 19th century using locally grown malt and hops. The dark beer called porter emerged in 18th-century London and was made from local ingredients. But both styles are now made by breweries around the world, following a recipe and using specific ingredients \u2013 certain types of malted barley, certain commercial strains of yeast \u2013 designed to emulate the original.\n\nA few hyper-regional beer styles have survived though \u2013 beers fermented with the wild yeasts and bacteria specific to a certain place. In some breweries in Belgium for example, lambic beers are made by pouring hot wort into a large, wide, shallow tray called a koelschip, or \u201ccoolship\u201d, allowing the ambient microbes in the brewery to settle on the liquid before it\u2019s transferred to cask to ferment. In other words, the flavour and character of the beer is dictated by the environment of the brewery. This is in stark contrast to most commercial brewing, where brewers dictate flavour and style by adding specific cultured yeasts: the last thing they want is for wild microbes to \u201cspoil\u201d the brew.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA handful of Australian breweries are embracing the philosophy of Belgian lambic production by using coolships to make some fantastically funky beers.\n\nAt La Sir\u00e8ne, next to Darebin Creek in the Melbourne suburb of Alphington, brewer Costa Nikias ferments an outstanding beer called Wild Tripelle spontaneously using a coolship. He also has four years\u2019 worth of saison ales maturing in barrels \u2013 a liquid library that he draws on to add complexity to his beers, blending older, barrel-aged material with younger freshly brewed liquid, much as a fortified wine producer in Rutherglen or Jerez will blend a muscat or a sherry.\n\nCosta Nikias at La Sir\u00e8ne Brewing in Melbourne.\n\nNikias started out in wine \u2013 he was all set to launch an urban winery before his passion for beer took over and he established a brewery instead \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise to hear him talking about how ambient microbial populations help create a sense of place in the flavour of his beers.\n\n\u201cThe fun part of what we do \u2013 and the part that leans more to the art of brewing than the science \u2013 is how the environment can influence the beer in each barrel,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t use barrels for flavour, but as vessels to build up local indigenous populations of yeast and bacteria in our brewery and the immediate environment, to express the personality of our site.\u201d\n\nWill Tatchell is another brewer focusing more and more on expressing the personality of his site. Tatchell established Van Dieman Brewing on his family\u2019s 160-hectare farm south of Launceston in the late 2000s. About five years ago he started looking for a point of difference for his business, and settled on a range of estate ales, made from entirely farm-grown or sourced ingredients \u2013 barley, hops, water and wild yeast.\n\nWill Tatchell at Van Dieman Brewing, Tasmania.\n\n\u201cWhen I was growing up I knew that the barley we produced on our farm went to make beer at Boags and Cascade,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought it would be good to grow some barley again and use it for our own beer. Now we can proudly tell people when they drink our estate range that everything in it comes from no further than 200 metres away from our front door.\u201d\n\nTatchell says that one of the best things about the modern Australian craft brewing industry is that any brewer can produce any style of beer by consulting a recipe and ordering in the right ingredients: Czech hops to produce a Czech-style pilsner, English malt to make an English-style porter. But, he says, this freedom is also one of the worst aspects of the craft boom: consumers have become obsessed with style and fashion, and have forgotten that beer was traditionally and can once again be thought of as an agricultural product every bit as regional as wine.\n\n\u201cRestaurants harp on all the time about the provenance of their produce,\u201d says Tatchell. \u201cThey tell you what farm the lamb is from, who grew the lettuce, the seasonality of their fruit. And wine people are really big on that side of things: which side of the hill the chardonnay was planted on. I want people to start thinking about beer the same way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSix of the Best\n\n2016 BOATROCKER\n\nDADDY KOEL\n\nBraeside, 500ml $20\n\nFermented using wild yeasts \u201charvested\u201d in a koelschip in Boatrocker\u2019s brewery in suburban Melbourne, and aged for two years in barrel. It\u2019s super-funky and quite rustic and will probably appeal more to lovers of stinky cheese.\n\nWILDFLOWER GOLD\n\nAUSTRALIAN WILD ALE\n\nMarrickville, 750ml $20\n\nYes, you could drink the latest batch of Gold \u2013 blend #20 \u2013 right now and enjoy its liquorous, yeasty, floral grain-juice freshness. But stick a few bottles away in a cool dark place for a year or two and you will be richly rewarded.\n\nBRIDGE ROAD/SAISON DE WILD\n\nGIACONDA\n\nBeechworth, 330ml $7.50\n\nThis is an amazingly complex, delicious, savoury ale, with flavours of cracked wheat and hints of dry sherry. It\u2019s sold in a four-pack with two other ales fermented using local chardonnay yeast and one with the brewery\u2019s own saison yeast.\n\n2018 LA SIR\u00c8NE\n\nCUVEE DE BOIS\n\nAlphington, 375ml $25\n\nA beer/wine hybrid made by co-fermenting a base of La Sir\u00e8ne farmhouse ale with chardonnay \u2013 both juice and whole bunches of grapes \u2013 then blending in a little barrel-aged saison. Deliciously different and will benefit from further bottle age.\n\nTWO METRE TALL\n\nDERWENT AROMATIC SPELT ALE\n\nDerwent Valley, 375ml $13\n\nAshley Huntington was one of Australia\u2019s pioneer producers of barrel- and bottle-aged beer made using farm-grown ingredients and fermented with wild yeast and bacteria. This soured ale has uncommon depth of flavour.\n\nVAN DIEMAN MAX\n\nSPRING SAISON\n\nEvandale, 500ml $12\n\nA true farmhouse ale made from barley, hops, water and yeast all sourced from the farm where the brewery is; the yeast was cultured up from a previous wild ferment at the brewery. Lifted lemony aromas lead on to a creamy texture in the mouth, balanced by a touch of sourness.\n\nThe Culinary issue of AFR Magazine is out on Friday, June 28 inside The Australian Financial Review.
