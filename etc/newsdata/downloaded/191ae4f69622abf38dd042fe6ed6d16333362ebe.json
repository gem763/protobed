(AP) - Once again, Nebraska will try to bounce back from a humiliating loss.\n\nThe Cornhuskers (3-2, 1-1 Big Ten) enter their game against Northwestern (1-3, 0-2) on Saturday off a 41-point beat-down at home by Ohio State. Last year, there was the 46-point road loss at Michigan, and the final two seasons under Mike Riley saw Nebraska lose five games by 30 or more points.\n\nCoach Scott Frost, who returned to his alma mater after leading Central Florida to a 13-0 season in 2017, said the Nebraska job isn\u2019t harder than he thought it would be.\n\n\u201cI knew a lot of the challenges coming in here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching Nebraska for a long time and it was a long way away from what it needed to be and where it should have been. Those changes can\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d\n\nFrost pointed out Nebraska had won seven of 10 games before the Ohio State game.\n\n\u201cGood things are coming,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re never satisfied with where they are. You always want it to go faster, but I don\u2019t think anyone in our building doubts that things are coming and it\u2019s going to make it even sweeter when you get there when you go through these things.\u201d\n\nNebraska and Northwestern both are looking to establish offensive consistency.\n\nThe Huskers thought they found it in the second half against Illinois on Sept. 21, but Ohio State\u2019s defensive starters held them under 100 total yards until late in the third quarter. Adrian Martinez completed just 8 of 17 passes for 47 yards, with three interceptions, and was sacked four times.\n\nFrost said Martinez doesn\u2019t deserve the blame because he has had to deal with \u201ca bunch of uncertainties.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting an awful lot on him anyway,\u201d Frost said, \u201cbut when he is worried about where the snap is, worried about who is coming unblocked, worried about if his receiver is going to be in the right place\u2026 That\u2019s too much to put on a quarterback.\u201d\n\nNorthwestern ranks 126th in the Football Bowl Subdivision in total offense (292.8 ypg) and pass completion rate (46.9 percent) and is tied for last with seven touchdowns. The Wildcats had 255 yards and averaged 3.1 yards per play in a 24-15 loss to Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cWe have some guys who are very confident on offense, and I also think they\u2019re pretty (mad), to be honest with you,\u201d Wildcats coach Pat Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey take it to heart. They take pride in how we prepare. And they\u2019re holding teammates accountable to bring them along. The excuse of being young is over. You\u2019re a month into the season. There needs to be a higher level of consistency and execution, and then confidence comes.\u201d\n\nALWAYS CLOSE\n\nThe teams have split eight meetings since the Huskers joined the Big Ten in 2011, with Northwestern winning three of four in Lincoln. Six games have been decided by one score.\n\nTURNOVERS KEY\n\nTurnovers have played a major role in the series, especially the last two years. In 2017, Northwestern intercepted a pass at its 16 and drove 84 yards for the tying touchdown before winning 31-24 in overtime. In Northwestern\u2019s 34-31 overtime win last year, the Huskers converted two turnovers into 10 points and the Wildcats set up their winning field goal with an interception of Martinez.\n\nNebraska is minus-4 in turnovers this season, Northwestern is minus-3.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to speak for Frosty,\u201d Fitzgerald said, \u201cbut both of us are turning it over at a rate that\u2019s a reason why we\u2019re having inconsistency on offense.\u201d\n\nMISSING PIECES\n\nBoth teams will be missing key players. The Big Ten suspended Nebraska defensive end Khalil Davis for the game for striking an Ohio State player in violation of the conference\u2019s sportsmanship policy. Northwestern will be without leading receiver Bennett Skowronek for at least a month. Skowronek, who didn\u2019t play against Wisconsin, had surgery for an undisclosed injury this week.\n\nTOUGH STRETCH\n\nNorthwestern, trying to avoid its first three-game conference losing streak since 2014, is in its toughest stretch of the season. Back-to-back road games against No. 8 Wisconsin and Nebraska are followed by home games against No. 4 Ohio State and No. 12 Iowa.\n\nPREPPING FOR \u2018I\u2019\n\nNebraska last week showed some of the offense Frost played in when he was the quarterback in the mid-1990s, having Dedrick Mills line up at fullback in the I formation. Fitzgerald called it \u201ccool stuff\u201d and said his defense is preparing to see more of it. Frost said, \u201cWe\u2019ll pick our spots.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Once again, Nebraska will try to bounce back from a humiliating loss.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eric Olson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/ohio_st_nebraska_football_57148_c0-168-4011-2506_s1770x1032.jpg?3f480a91fe4d2f870e2ad5a1e34fffebd8538f27", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
