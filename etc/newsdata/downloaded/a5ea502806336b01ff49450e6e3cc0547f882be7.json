Only these \u201cM-V-P\u201d chants for Elena Delle Donne sounded louder than any had all year. Passionate supporters had packed the cozy venue \u2014 on an NFL Sunday, no less \u2014 to watch the best team in the WNBA and celebrate the league\u2019s leading MVP candidate. Neither the Mystics nor Delle Donne disappointed.\n\nWashington beat the Chicago Sky, 100-86, in its regular season finale, even though it had nothing left to play for but pride. The Mystics entered Sunday afternoon having already achieved their yearlong goal of securing the No. 1 seed in the WNBA playoffs, which they clinched with a win over the Dallas Wings on Friday.\n\nBut Washington couldn\u2019t abide anything less than full effort \u2014 not in front of a home crowd that hasn\u2019t witnessed a loss since July 13.\n\n\u201cThey were crazy tonight, right?\u201d Delle Donne said of the \u201cM-V-P\u201d chants that continued to ring out as she stood on the court for an interview after the game. \u201c[It\u2019s] something that gives you chills. I absolutely love this city. There\u2019s nowhere I would rather be, and for them to have my back like that really means a lot. It was a special moment.\u201d\n\n[The Mystics have flipped into playoff mode as they conclude regular season]\n\nThe Mystics (26-8) played their starters for close to normal minutes Sunday and came away with a win to cap a record-setting season for the franchise. Never before has Washington won 26 games. The Mystics have never been the No. 1 seed in the playoffs, and they have never had a player who has had a season such as Delle Donne\u2019s. She had game highs of 25 points and 12 rebounds Sunday, and she added three assists and three blocks in 25 minutes.\n\nDelle Donne also officially became the first WNBA player to sustain at least 50-percent shooting from the floor, 40-percent shooting from the three-point line and 90-percent shooting from the free throw line for an entire regular season. She shot 50.8 percent from the field, 42.9 percent from three and 97.3 percent from the line in 2019.\n\nDelle Donne and her team\u2019s reward is an eight-day layoff before their first playoff game Sept. 17 at home.\n\nBoth the Mystics and No. 2 seed Connecticut (23-11) received a double-bye into the semifinals, while No. 3 seed Los Angeles (22-12) received a first-round bye and must win one single-elimination game to get to the semis.\n\nLas Vegas (21-13) clinched the No. 4 seed and a first-round bye with Chicago\u2019s loss. The Sky (20-14) will be the No. 5 seed and faces a tough road ahead: To get to the semifinals it will have to win two single-elimination games before the playoffs convert to a best-of-five format beginning with the final four.\n\nThe Seattle Storm (18-16), which beat Washington in the Finals to win the league title last year, is the No. 6 seed, the Minnesota Lynx (18-16) is the No. 7 seed, and the Phoenix Mercury (15-19) is the No. 8 seed.\n\nThe playoffs begin Wednesday.\n\n[Down two guards, the Mystics survived by going big. Can that work in the playoffs?]\n\nWhile most of the league prepares, the Mystics will rest \u2014 which is another reason Washington Coach and General Manager Mike Thibault felt good about playing some of his starters only slightly less than normal against the Sky. Emma Meesseman had 11 points in 29 minutes. Starting point guard Natasha Cloud played 29 minutes as well, adding eight points and six assists.\n\nTianna Hawkins returned after sitting out for two games because of knee soreness and had 24 points and nine rebounds.\n\n\u201cWe knew we had a really good Chicago team that was on a roll coming in. We also knew we have nine days until we have another game,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cWe wanted to play. We wanted to get that practice under our belts, and it was a really good win. Obviously the crowd was electric, too, so we wanted to play for them. They showed out. It was like they were preparing for playoffs, too.\u201d\n\nThibault said he hopes to schedule a scrimmage-like practice against the team\u2019s male practice squad this week to keep the Mystics fresh.\n\nIt was clear from the start Sunday the team was still plenty motivated. Delle Donne had 20 points in the first half, when she and her teammates were shouting a little louder than usual to be heard over Sunday\u2019s rowdy crowd, which was perhaps the most exuberant it has been since the season opener.\n\n\u201cWe are, I think, 14-2 in this building. Our other loss [at home] was at Capital One [Arena],\u201d Thibault said afterward. \u201cThe crowd has made, really, an effective crowd has given us a home-court advantage that we haven\u2019t had. It\u2019s loud out there. I think it\u2019ll be louder for the playoffs. . . . This has been a fun first year in this building. Hopefully it\u2019ll be another fun month in this building.\u201d", "description": "Washington finishes with a franchise-best 26-8 record after playing its regulars against Chicago despite already clinching the top seed in the upcoming WNBA playoffs.", "authors": ["Ava Wallace", "Reporter Covering Local Colleges", "September At Pm", "Ava Wallace Covers College Sports With A Focus On Georgetown", "Navy", "Maryland", "As Well As Tennis", "The Wnba For The Washington Post.
