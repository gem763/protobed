This resulted in more people choosing TADA vans that charge similar fares but offer better services, causing more ire from taxi drivers.\n\nBut all this arm-wrestling has left customers bearing the brunt as they have to either pay more or put up with poorer services.", "description": "TADA Delays Expansion Plan", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
