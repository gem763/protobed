After swiping the pork, he concealed the meat in his bag before hopping on his bike to flee the scene.\n\nHe was, however, caught red-handed in a video now circulating online, later admitting to the theft of 2kg of meat. Police said the suspect, Mr Guo, couldn\u2019t believe someone would so carelessly abandon the meat, local media reported.\n\nChina\u2019s pork prices have skyrocketed over the last year, up 70 per cent in September compared to last year, as a swine flu outbreak has knocked out a third of the country\u2019s pigs.\n\nThe outbreak began last year, quickly spreading throughout China and into other parts of Asia, affecting pig numbers and food supply.", "description": "People are increasingly resorting to stealing pork in China as prices for the meat soar, with swine flu decimating the country\u2019s hog herd.", "authors": ["Sophia Yan", "Pieter Cleppe", "Benedict Spence", "Ben Fogle", "Martin Howe"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/7rhKhZTqnVI/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
