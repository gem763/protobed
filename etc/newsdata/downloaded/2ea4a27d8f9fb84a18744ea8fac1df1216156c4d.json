(Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nPete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign on Friday drew scathing criticisms from black activists for accepting donations from Steve Patton, a former Chicago attorney who directed efforts to delay the release of a video depicting the 2014 shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald by a Chicago police office.\n\nThe city\u2019s handling of the shooting resulted in a Department of Justice investigation, stirred months of protest, and resulted in an officer\u2019s conviction.\n\n\u201cThe worst case scenario is his people know and they just don\u2019t care, or they don\u2019t know and haven\u2019t vetted him thoroughly,\u201d Charlene Carruthers, the former head of a Black Lives Matter group that pushed for police reforms in the wake of the McDonald case, told The Associated Press after it was reported Friday that Patton was sponsoring a Chicago fundraiser for Buttigieg. \u201cIf they do know, it\u2019s indicative of so much of what we see with folks in the LGBTQ community \u2014 particularly white men.\u201d\n\nButtigieg\u2019s campaign initially declined to comment on Patton\u2019s participation in the fundraiser, but later released an apology in the face of public backlash. \u201cHe should adjust his schedule,\u201d Reverend Jesse Jackson commented when initially told about the fundraiser.\n\n\u201cTransparency and justice for Laquan McDonald is more important than a campaign contribution,\u201d Buttigieg spokesman Chris Meagher said. \u201cWe are returning the money [Steve Patton] contributed to the campaign and the money he has collected. He is no longer a co-host for the event and will not be attending.\u201d\n\nButtigieg has faced questions about his record on race in the past, including this past summer, when the South Bend, Ind. mayor was accused of \u201clying\u201d by constituents over a police shooting and was accused of handling the situation \u201csolely for his political gain and not for the health of the city he serves\u201d by the South Bend Fraternal Order of Police.\n\nIn May, Buttigieg polled at zero percent among black voters in South Carolina.", "description": "Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign on Friday drew criticisms from black activists for accepting donations from Steve Patton, who delayed a Laquan McDonald video.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
