He told me to 'shut your f****** prattle' which I'll never forget.'\n\nEarlier he told the court his then-wife Jenni and the two girls travelled by car from their home in north London to the match.\n\nHe said Mrs Hicks had gone to take up a seat in the stand when they arrived just before 2pm and his daughters had headed down the tunnel to the central pens of the Leppings Lane terrace while he bought programmes, he told the hearing.\n\nGiving evidence at the retrial of match commander David Duckenfield (pictured outside court today), their father Trevor claimed he was given 'filthy looks' and told to be quiet after pleading with officers to help save his children\n\nChairman of Hillsborough family support group Margaret Aspinall is pictured arriving at Preston Crown Court today\n\nHe said: 'One of my last clear images of them was them looking over their shoulders with a bit of a grin.'\n\nMr Hicks took up a position in a side pen, just underneath the police control box, he said.\n\nThe court heard Mr Hicks later found his daughters on the pitch, lying 'near enough side by side'.\n\nHe put Victoria in an ambulance and went to hospital with her, believing Sarah would be in another ambulance following closely behind, the jury was told.\n\nAfter Victoria died at the hospital, Mr and Mrs Hicks learned Sarah's body was at the gymnasium at the stadium.\n\nJenni Hicks is pictured arriving at Preston Crown Court today with Margaret Aspinall (left) and Sue Roberts (centre)\n\nMr Hicks told the court he and his wife travelled back to London that night.\n\nHe said: 'We were told the girls were the property of the coroner and we wouldn't be able to see them, touch them or anything else.'\n\nDuckenfield, 75, denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool supporters who died in the crush on the terrace.\n\nUnder the law at the time there can be no prosecution for the death of the 96th victim, Anthony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after his injuries were caused.\n\nThe retired South Yorkshire Police chief superintendent stood trial for gross negligence manslaughter in January but the jury was unable to return any verdict and was discharged.", "description": "Sarah and Victoria Hicks, 19 and 15, died at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on April 15 1989.
