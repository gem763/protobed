Facebook also recently acquired a company called CTRL Labs that lets you control computers with your mind. And Neuralink, a start-up once backed by Elon Musk, announced its brain-computer will start trials on humans next year.\n\n\"I'm always interested in the question: What is changing the fastest right now? Because whatever that is determining the history of next year,\" Schmidt told the crowd. \"There's lot of evidence that biology is in that golden period right now.\"\n\nHe gave examples of vision data aiding computing advances and smart assistants bolstering biological research and medical cure advances. \"The way the eye and the vision works and so forth, will undoubtedly generate algorithms that are very powerful that we don't fully understand right now,\" Schmidt said.\n\nUnder Schmidt, Google's made several early vision-related investments and most faced snags. Alphabet's life sciences company Verily tried creating smart contact lenses, which aimed to measure blood sugar levels in tears. It has also filed patents for eye-tracking and, of course, who can forget the infamously defunct Google Glass.\n\n\"It's easy to come up with movie recommendations or YouTube recommendations, because we have millions of data points of people like you,\" Schmidt said. \"We don't have an analogous amount of data in biology yet.\"\n\nSchmidt said he'd like to marry the two worlds as quickly as possible. At one point, he asked the crowd to \"build bacteria that absorbs CO2,\" adding \"We need it at scale and we need it in the next 10 to 15 years.\"", "description": "Eric Schmidt told a conference crowd that Silicon Valley is obsessed with biology because it's the perfect \"marriage\" with tech right now.", "authors": ["Jennifer Elias"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/101166823-20130925-3751-319.jpg?v=1394221783"}
