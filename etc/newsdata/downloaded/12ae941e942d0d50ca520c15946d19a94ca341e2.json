A couple of sedan versions even get the hatchback\u2019s added zip under the hood. The Corolla also comes in a high-mileage hybrid model that uses the Prius powertrain; that version is not covered in this review.\n\n2020 Toyota Corolla (Photo: Fred Meier, Cars.com)\n\nThe Corolla has long been the safe choice for sedan shoppers, with both a well-earned reputation for dependability and the emotional appeal of an appliance; my refrigerator sparks more joy. It hasn\u2019t wanted for buyers, though, splitting a third of annual compact sedan sales in the U.S. with the other big dog, Honda\u2019s Civic. The new Corolla won\u2019t upset its legions of loyalists, nor is it in danger of becoming a cult favorite, such as the Volkswagen Golf GTI or Honda Civic Si. But improved driving manners, better tech and more refinement make it \u2013 like its hatchback sibling \u2013 a Corolla you might want, not just need.\n\nThe 2020 sedan offers five trim levels: L, LE, SE, XLE and XSE. I drove several versions for this review. The new hybrid is unfortunately offered only as an LE, replacing the old LE Eco.\n\nVolkswagen places massive bet on electric cars: Will consumers buy in?\n\nA dose of the hatchback\u2019s style\n\nThe Corolla\u2019s new styling isn\u2019t as sexy as the 2019 Mazda3 or as flamboyant as the Civic, but the formerly dowdy sedan now has much crisper styling, with stronger wheel openings and an upswept character line. The revised trapezoidal grille and new front bumper corners vary by trim level, but the standard skinny LED headlight assemblies stretching around the corners came directly from the hatchback, as did the \u201ctriple J\u201d LED accent lights on higher trim levels. It keeps its tidy dimensions, varying less than an inch in any direction from the 2019.\n\nThe rear look is tamer (to wrap its arms around a trunk), with slimmer LED taillights, an upturned upper lip on the trunk lid and more lower bumper cladding. Sportier models add a dark gray rear spoiler and twin exhaust tips. Alloy wheels are standard on higher trim levels (with good-looking 18-inchers on the sportier SE and XSE) and optional on the LE.\n\nA classier cabin\n\nThe new interior replaces the previous mishmash of rental-car materials with the hatchback\u2019s cleaner design and better trimmings, including a soft-touch dashboard with piano-black accents even on lower trim levels. The dashboard\u2019s shape enhances a roomy feel in the front. The standard upholstery is cloth, while the XLE gets SofTex vinyl and the sportier SE and XSE trim levels get the most undiluted version of the hatchback interior, including comfy, supportive sport seats with vinyl trim and color-accented cloth inserts that match the contrast stitching. As before, the only animal leather you\u2019ll find in any Corolla is on the steering wheel and shift lever in higher trims.\n\n2020 Toyota Corolla (Photo: Fred Meier, Cars.com)\n\nDoes yours make the cut?: Few big names on list of some of the 50 best cities to live in the US\n\nThe backseat is roomy, unlike the hatch\u2019s cozy rear quarters. There\u2019s enough leg and head space for me, at 6-foot-2, to sit \u201cbehind myself\u201d in the backseat. In most trim levels, quality doesn\u2019t drop markedly in the back. The tops of the door panels were harder in the rear of the LE, for example, but the armrests front and rear were wrapped and padded. The cabin is still a little noisy, but there\u2019s less wind, road and engine noise than in the 2019 \u2013 even more so in higher trim levels with added insulation.\n\nVisibility is good all around and significantly improved at the front corners, thanks to thinner front pillars and the relocation of the side mirrors to the doors.\n\nCabin storage is a little stingy, even for a small car, falling short of the Civic\u2019s space. There\u2019s a large but hard device bin at the front of the center console and a small covered bin at the rear. The front door bins at least include a handy divider that kept my water bottle secure. There\u2019s also a fold-down rear armrest with cupholders (except on the base L trim level). Trunk space is 13.1 cubic feet \u2013 competitive for a compact sedan, but less than the Civic or Volkswagen Jetta \u2013 and all trim levels have 60/40-split, folding rear backrests to expand the space.\n\nMultimedia and tech amped up\n\nSitting atop the new dashboard is a touchscreen with welcome volume and tuning knobs and mechanical shortcut buttons rather than touch-sensitive panels like the Civic uses. Base L models get a 7-inch screen; all others get an 8-inch screen. Apple CarPlay integration is standard, as is Amazon Alexa, but if you\u2019re an Android Auto user you\u2019re still out of luck. A 4.2-inch driver information display alongside the analog gauges is standard on lower trim levels, while a fancier 7-inch configurable instrument display that sits prominently in the center is standard on the XLE, XSE and hybrid.\n\n2020 Toyota Corolla (Photo: fred meier)\n\nSave smart: 3 ways you could be losing money when saving for retirement\n\nTwo USB ports are included on all but the L, with the second one in the center console bin meant to serve the rear seat. Wi-Fi capability (with subscription) is standard; wireless charging is newly optional. Six-speaker audio is standard, while a nine-speaker JBL system with a rear subwoofer is optional, bundled in a package with in-dash navigation for the XSE and XLE.\n\nYou want the engine upgrade\n\nThe more fun engine for the Corolla \u2013 which you can have only in the sportier SE and XSE trims \u2013 is a 169-horsepower, 2.0-liter direct-injection four-cylinder that made its debut in the hatchback. It puts out 151 pounds-feet of torque, and its acceleration is reasonably strong and smooth \u2013 much better than the base engine.\n\nAs in the hatchback, this engine is mated to a \u201csmart\u201d six-speed manual (but only on the SE) or a new-design continuously variable automatic transmission. The CVT does a good job of cutting CVT drone, and it also has a physical 1st gear to add pep and a more conventional feel off the line. Paddle shifters let you click through artificial gear steps once the CVT\u2019s steel belt takes over. The stick has an Intelligent Manual Transmission mode that adds sports-car-like rev-matching on downshifts, unusual for a compact sedan. It also helps match engine and transmission speeds for smoother upshifts and mitigates stalling at launch. My main criticism is the engine\u2019s limited availability; the rival Civic sedan puts its 174-hp, turbocharged 1.5-liter in all but the two lowest trim levels.\n\nI was not able to drive the SE sedan with the six-speed manual, but I found that transmission made the hatchback a lot more fun. Cars.com\u2019s L.A. Bureau Chief Brian Wong reports similar magic for the sedan, unlike the previous model\u2019s sloppy and vague manual. He found that the downshift rev-matching doesn\u2019t have \u201cPorsche or Chevrolet Corvette levels of responsiveness, but it does a fine job of blipping the throttle slightly so you ease into downshifts. Another benefit is that it helps out on launches, especially for beginners, by adding a bit more throttle if you come up on the clutch without giving it enough gas\u201d to avert a stall. \u201cThere\u2019s a touch of vagueness in the gates between the gears, and the throws are a tad long for really vigorous driving. But predictable clutch feel, a shifter in the right spot \u2013 so you\u2019re not stretching for any gears \u2013 and easy use go a long way toward an enjoyable stick experience.\u201d\n\n2020 Toyota Corolla (Photo: Fred Meier, Cars.com)\n\nSadly, most non-hybrid Corolla buyers will make do, even in the loaded XLE, with the ho-hum carryover 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that puts out 139 hp (up 7 hp for 2020) and 126 pounds-feet of torque, which is mated to a conventional CVT (without the 1st-gear innovation). It will get you there, which may be enough for Corolla loyalists, but acceleration is sluggish, and the old-school engine is noisier and coarser than the 2.0-liter.\n\nIf you need another reason to want the 2.0-liter, how about better gas mileage? The 1.8-liter\u2019s mileage improved slightly over the 2019, but the 2.0-liter with the CVT still beats it by 1 to 2 mpg in each category. You can compare them here. Toyota officials say this is because the new-generation 2.0-liter has improved fuel management and a higher compression ratio; the new CVT also spreads gearing higher. All versions and trim levels deliver very competitive 32-34 mpg EPA combined ratings, shamed only by the hybrid Corolla\u2019s 52 mpg combined. In testing, I found I exceeded the ratings by an mpg or two.\n\nAnalyst: 1-day shipping from Amazon could generate $24 billion in additional revenue\n\nMore engaging dynamics\n\nRegardless of engine, all Corolla buyers get a better-handling car than in previous years. It feels more planted and composed, with a smoother ride that handles bumps well on all but the roughest pavement. Toyota says its new platform is 60 percent stiffer, and it shows. The 2020 Corolla also has a multilink independent rear suspension \u2013 an unusual upgrade among mainstream compact sedans, which commonly use cheaper torsion beam rear suspensions. It helps create a more agile feel \u2013 with or without the sportier suspension tuning, 18-inch wheels and lower-profile tires of the SE and XSE trim levels.\n\nThe standard Active Corner Assist system uses selective braking to help hold the line in cornering. The steering also has better weighting, though it felt less so in the LE than in higher trim levels, which Toyota officials said was due to the lower weight and different tires of the LE, not different tuning. Overall, the Corolla isn\u2019t at the top of the compact car class when it comes to handling \u2013 try a Mazda3 or Volkswagen Golf, just to name two \u2013 but it\u2019s a lot less bland to drive than it used to be.\n\nImpressive safety and driver tech standard\n\nAll trim levels of the Corolla and Corolla Hybrid come with the full-featured Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 package of safety and driver assistance technology. The package includes a full-speed front collision warning system with automatic braking and pedestrian detection. It also includes lane departure alert with steering assist, road edge detection, automatic high beams and full-speed adaptive cruise control with stop and go (in CVT-equipped models). Also included is a new lane-centering system that proved very good at keeping the car in a marked lane, though it occasionally paused at exit lane splits. Blind spot warning is standard on higher trim levels and available in the LE and up. Adaptive headlights are optional in an Advanced Lighting Package on XLE and XSE trim levels. The Corolla\u2019s standard safety and driver assistance bundle is comparable to (but more robust overall than) the Civic sedan\u2019s standard package, including more features at more trim levels than most rivals.\n\nOnly higher-trim 2020 Corollas equipped with optional adaptive LED headlights earned an acceptable rating in headlight tests. The standard LED headlights were rated marginal for \u201cinadequate visibility in multiple IIHS test scenarios.\u201d\n\nWe have not yet done a Cars.com Car Seat Check on the 2020 Corolla, but the Latch anchors and tethers for child-safety seats appear to be easily accessible in the rear seat (though I wonder how long it would take me to lose one or more of the detachable Latch covers).\n\nFrom Tesla to Fiat: These car brands have declining sales\n\nYou pay more for improved value\n\nPrices are up for every trim level, though Toyota is quick to point to additional value, such as all the standard safety tech. As this was written, the base L starts $925 higher at $20,555 (all prices include a $955 destination charge, up $25 for 2020) and includes the CVT automatic. That undercuts an automatic base 2019 Civic LX at $21,280. Compare Corolla and Civic trim levels and features here.\n\nThe high-volume LE\u2019s $21,005 starting price is $940 higher than the 2019, though if the LE appeals to you it\u2019s worth checking out the high-mileage, LE-only hybrid that starts at $24,055 \u2013 about $3,000 more, but still less than the cheapest Toyota Prius. If you want the new gas engine, the sportier SE starts at $23,005 with the CVT and $23,705 with the six-speed manual (though this version adds other features, as well). The XLE is up $1,940 at $25,005 to start; the XSE with the new engine goes up $2,695 to start at $26,380. That pushes the XSE into new territory; add the $1,715 premium audio and connectivity package and the total hits $28,220. Compare that to $28,330 for the top-trim 2019 Civic Touring.\n\nThe Corolla has a typical warranty of three years/36,000 miles, five years/60,000 miles for the powertrain. But it also gives buyers two years or 25,000 miles of free scheduled maintenance and roadside assistance.\n\nCars.com\u2019s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
