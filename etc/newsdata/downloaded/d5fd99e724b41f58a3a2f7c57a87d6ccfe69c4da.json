More intense dry spells reduce freshwater flowing outward. Adding to the peril, in some places the land is naturally sinking.\n\nAll of this allows seawater to claim new territory, killing trees from the roots up.\n\nRising seas often conjure the threat to faraway, low-lying nations or island-states. But to understand the immediate consequences of some of the most rapid sea-level rise anywhere in the world, stand among the scraggly, dying pines of Dorchester County along the Maryland coast.\n\nChesapeake Bay\u2019s Migrating Marshes\n\nPeople living on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay, the country\u2019s largest estuary system, have a front-row view of the sea\u2019s rapid advance, said Keryn Gedan, a wetland ecologist at George Washington University.\n\nPart of the reason for the quickly rising waters may be that the Gulf Stream, which flows northward up the coast, is slowing down as meltwater from Greenland inhibits its flow. That is causing what some scientists describe as a pileup of water along the East Coast, elevating sea levels locally.\n\nThe effects of climate change are also exacerbated by land that is sinking as a result of geological processes triggered by the end of the last ice age.\n\nBecause of the extraordinary speed at which the water is rising here, Gedan said, \u201cI think of this area as a window into the future for the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nIn Dorchester County, where dead and dying loblolly pines stand forlornly, Gedan has learned to \u201cread\u201d these forests from the mix of species present.\n\nAs saltwater moves into the ground, oak and other sensitive hardwoods die first. Loblolly pine, the most salt-tolerant, is often the last tree standing until it, too, is overwhelmed.\n\nThen the saltwater marsh plants move in. If you\u2019re lucky, velvety tufts of cordgrass sprout. If not, impenetrable stands of cane-like Phragmites, an invasive species, take over.\n\nOne reason the effects of rising seas are so noticeable here is that the land has very little slope. Those 5 millimeters of sea level, a rise that\u2019s only slightly more than two half-dollar coins stacked, can translate into saltwater pushing 15 feet inland per year, according to Gedan.\n\nShoots of sweet gum, a tree with star-shaped leaves and bark like alligator skin, have more tolerance for salt than other hardwoods, such as oak. They can endure for a time as groundwater becomes more saline.\n\nBut eventually, the sweet gum dies as well.\n\nThe Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, where Gedan does research, lost 3,000 acres of forest and agricultural land between 1938 and 2006. More than 5,000 acres of marsh became open water.\n\nAt first, this trend depressed Matt Whitbeck, a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service who works at the refuge. Saltwater marshes are important nurseries for the fish and crabs people like to eat.\n\nBut in 2012, he realized the marsh wasn\u2019t entirely disappearing; it was migrating. Some of the 3,000 acres of forest that the refuge had lost had transformed into saltwater marsh.\n\nHis outlook changed. \u201cWe need to think about where the marsh is moving, not where it is,\u201d he said.\n\nBut in nearby Smithville, a historically African American town, this movement poses an existential threat. Backyards have been gobbled up by advancing marsh, basketball courts overgrown. What were once thick stands of pine near the water\u2019s edge have greatly thinned. The marsh now menaces a graveyard.\n\nResidents have battled the advancing wetlands for years, said Roslyn Watts, 60, who grew up here. All that time, she and her neighbors thought the inexorable advance was simply the price of living near water\u2019s edge.\n\nBut in 2010, she learned about global warming and sea level rise, she said. She understood that what was happening wasn\u2019t entirely natural.\n\n\u201cI was angry,\u201d she said, and particularly incensed by the idea that retreat was the only workable strategy. The Dutch didn\u2019t retreat, she said. They built dikes.
