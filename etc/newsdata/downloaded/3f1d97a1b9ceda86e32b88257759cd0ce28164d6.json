The devices were designed and produced via a partnership with Esports Arena, which runs the first dedicated e-sports arena in North America.\n\nIt might seem unexpected that one of the largest retailers in the world has decided to join the world of PC gaming, but the industry\u2019s rapid growth \u2014 thanks to games like Fortnite \u2014 gives Walmart all the reasons it needs to cater to a new market.\n\nBut winning over fickle and particular PC gamers can be a challenge. Simply mentioning, \u201cWalmart gaming laptop\u201d to some of my clanmates resulted in laughter, followed by an interrogation: \u201cYou went to Walmart of all places, for a gaming laptop?\u201d Unknown gaming brands come with a variety of questions and concerns around build quality and technical support. For example, who will you call if there\u2019s a technical issue?\n\nWalmart is seemingly aware of these concerns, so in order to entice skeptical buyers, it\u2019s doing what it does best: slashing prices.\n\nFor $1,299, the Overpowered 17+ has a far better value for the screen size and specs than laptops you might find from Asus, MSI, and Razer. For that price, it\u2019s difficult to find a Core i7 processor, dedicated graphics, a 144Hz full HD screen, backlit keyboard, Windows Hello facial recognition, and even an SSD / HDD storage combo.\n\nIt\u2019s a spec sheet that should allow you to play most new PC titles at medium to high settings, but in practice, the 17+ doesn\u2019t perform as well as it should. Unfortunately, no amount of cost savings can make up for Walmart\u2019s inexperience with PC gaming hardware.\n\nOur review of Overpowered 17+ Verge Score 5 out of 10 Good Stuff Large 144Hz screen\n\nGood port selection\n\nAggressive pricing Bad Stuff Cheap, flimsy build quality\n\nCustomer support concerns\n\nGPU isn\u2019t powerful enough to take advantage of refresh rate\n\nTouchpad and keyboard are awful Buy for $1,299.00 from Walmart\n\nWalmart\u2019s manufacturing strategy for the Overpowered products differs whether its a desktop or laptop model. A representative explained that Esports Arena chose the specs for the devices and then used a tweaked reference design for the laptops and contracted a \u201cFortune 100 manufacturer\u201d for the desktops. The company would not confirm who manufactured the reference design and declined to name the desktop manufacturer.\n\nOverpowered 17+ Specs 17.3-inch, 144Hz 1080p screen\n\nIntel i7-8750H processor with 2.20GHz base clock\n\n32GB RAM at 2667MHz\n\nNvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 6GB VRAM\n\nMechanical RGB LED keyboard\n\n2TB HDD\n\n256GB SSD\n\nWindows 10 with Hello facial recognition\n\nWeighs 5.65 pounds\n\nOverpowered PCs are not original PCs\n\nUsing a reference design for a gaming laptop is not uncommon. These \u201cwhite label PCs\u201d are computers produced by ODMs (original design manufacturers), like Compal and Clevo, then are rebranded and sold by other retailers, such as CyberPowerPC or iBuyPower.\n\nThe big difference between Walmart and CyberPowerPC selling rebranded computers is the latter has established its own brand presence and has a history of reliable technical customer support. To test out how Walmart handles this crucial piece of the customer experience, I called Overpowered\u2019s support line, which turns out to be really just several automated menus that eventually lead to a general Walmart representative who could only offer to exchange a product if it turned out to be defective. They were unable to help me with any technical questions or problems.\n\nOn top of customer service, good build quality can be difficult to achieve with this type of approach. Solid build quality can be the differentiator between first and second place for machines with identical specs. Unfortunately, Walmart and Esports Arena struggle in this area. The new Overpowered desktop was recently pulled from its Walmart listing, after a number of videos and blogs highlighted various build issues from the factory. A company representative explained that the desktops were removed to \u201cupdate product information\u201d in their listings. At time of publication for this review, the desktops (and laptops) were back up for sale with lower prices than originally.\n\nOverpowered has already had its first build quality fiasco\n\nWhile the Overpowered 17+ unit I\u2019ve been using hasn\u2019t had any serious issues \u2014 besides a blue screen of death (BSoD) during a graphics driver upgrade \u2014 it still feels like a thoughtless design. The all-plastic body is chintzy and somehow made even more tacky with one of the worst gaming PC logos I\u2019ve seen. The screen itself can exhibit noticeable flex, as do the corners of the palm rests. If the best gaming laptops this year were fine metal cutlery, then what you\u2019re looking at here is plastic tableware.\n\nThings get worse as soon as you touch the keyboard and touchpad. Walmart is advertising mechanical key switches on the 17+, which are unique for a laptop. But those fancy switches don\u2019t provide a satisfactory typing experience. The throw is short, the feedback is faint, and I don\u2019t even like the shape of the key caps. The 17+ has individually backlit keys instead of the single, colored backlight the more expensive Razer Blade 15 uses, but that doesn\u2019t make up for a bad keyboard.\n\nThe touchpad and keyboard are equally awful\n\nMuch like the keyboard, the trackpad is poor and frustrating to use. It struggles to register single-tap selections, confuses a tap for a right-click if my finger is half way up the surface area, and has clunky, hollow-feeling clicks. Normally, I\u2019d only recommend you use a gaming mouse when playing games, but in the Overpowered 17+\u2019s case, you need to use an external mouse for anything you want to do on the computer.\n\nPerhaps thanks to that plasticky chassis, the Overpowered 17+ weighs 5.65 pounds, making it several pounds lighter than many other 17-inch gaming laptops that can weigh close to ten pounds. But its large footprint outweighs any weight savings. It\u2019s tricky putting a 17-inch laptop in most of my backpacks, this one being a tight squeeze in particular because of how wide the body is. Seventeen-inch laptops aren\u2019t typically designed to be moved around very often, and the Overpowered model is no exception.\n\nOffsetting some of my disappointment in the chassis is the port selection. There are two USB 3.0 ports and a full-size SD card slot on the right, with one USB 2.0 port, full-size Ethernet, and audio inputs on the left. The back side of the laptop is home to a USB Type-C port (not Thunderbolt 3.0, sadly), two DisplayPorts, an HDMI port, and the power connector. It\u2019s a decent selection that will probably save you from buying dongles, especially if you plan on using the computer for photography or video editing work.\n\nA useful port on nearly every side\n\nAnother highlight on the Overpowered 17+ is the screen. It doesn\u2019t have the thinnest bezels, HDR, or G-Sync. However, it\u2019s bright and vibrant enough to be suitable for gaming. Its high refresh rate allows for smoother gameplay than most laptops in this price range. There are even a few game profiles you can choose from in the hardware management app, so you can balance out color reproduction for a specific genre, like an FPS or MOBA. The feature produces a noticeable shift in colors, so I used it often to get the best image I could.\n\nPerformance-wise, the Overpowered 17+ is anything but what its name implies. The Core i7-8750H processor is strong \u2014 the Razer Blade 15, MSI GS65, and Alienware m15 all use the same chip. But the Nvidia GTX1060 in this laptop isn\u2019t powerful enough to drive 144 fps frame rates in demanding AAA titles. Battlefield V tops out at 70 fps on medium settings or 50 fps on high settings, which is far lower than the screen\u2019s native rate.\n\nCompared to the 15.6-inch Acer Helios 300 laptop, which has the same processor and GPU, the Overpowered computer runs about 10 to 20 percent slower. Where I can hit over 100 fps in Rainbow Six: Siege on the Acer, the Overpowered machine is only able to reach 80 fps. It\u2019s clear that something related to GPU optimization went awry in the Overpowered 17+. The only way you\u2019re hitting 144 fps is playing less graphically intense games, like League of Legends, Overwatch, or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. This machine is definitely not future-proofed for upcoming PC games.\n\nThe Overpowered laptop\u2019s performance is not representative of white-label laptops as a whole. Origin PC\u2019s Evo15-S is a rebranded Max Q gaming laptop that provides a great gaming experience. Rather, it seems that the choices Walmart and its partners made in components and build quality (which allow it to have that attractive price tag) are what bring the computer down.\n\nWhile the Overpowered 17+ is a far better value for its screen size and specs than what you might find from Asus, MSI, and Razer, it\u2019s not worth recommending. Its gaudy design is marred with a sub-par touchpad and keyboard, with gaming performance hobbled by a graphics chip that can\u2019t take full advantage of the screen. That\u2019s all before we get to Overpowered\u2019s build quality issues, as well as a lack of compelling technical support.\n\nMeanwhile, Walmart should consider rolling back its PC gaming lineup.", "description": "Should you buy a Walmart gaming PC? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to ask myself during my test of the Overpowered 17+, a $1,299 17.3-inch gaming laptop. Ultimately, the 17+ offers a lot for its low price, but ultimately, it falls short of every other gaming laptop, including similarly priced models.", "authors": ["Stefan Etienne", "Dec", "Photography Amelia Holowaty Krales", "The Verge"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d4Dvk1U0o2Ww2NFOrcE--LGxedY=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13606455/akrales_181205_3117_0077.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-10"}
