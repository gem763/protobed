They'd be better off with Fellaini up front with Lukaku, Sanchez up front, there's no doubt,' he told Sky Sports.\n\n'They now need to fix a style and fix a way of recruiting. It is going to be painful and the board are going to need to hold their nerve.\n\n'They've cocked it up over many years. They're responsible for this poor recruitment. They've gone for completely different styles of managers.\n\n'They've now gone with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and a completely different style. If you change direction every two years and invest \u00a3250million along the way with each manager, you're going to have problems.'\n\nThe defeat reinforced Neville's belief that United would be better off with Romelu Lukaku\n\nLukaku joined Marouane Fellaini (left) and Alexis Sanchez in leaving United this calendar year\n\nDespite such a tumultuous start to the season, the former United right-back insists that Solskjaer must continue his 'clean-up job' and secure the sort of funds that were handed to his predecessors.\n\n'Manchester United are now getting the pain that they deserve for poor decisions at board level.\n\n'Solskjaer needs to make sure that the clean-up job that he's doing, which needs to be done for the mess that's gone before him... he needs to make sure that he gets the opportunity to spend that \u00a3250m that the others have had to spend so that he can have an opportunity.\n\n''There's things out there that I liked. I liked Tuanzebe and Maguire, there's the bones of a partnership there. Put five or six players of real quality in there. They need to recruit well.\n\nNeville also insisted that Solskjaer must be financially backed like his predecessors\n\nNeville stated that money should help complement Axel Tuanzebe (left) and Harry Maguire\n\n'They got \u00a375m for Lukaku. They got Smalling, Herrera, Sanchez and Fellaini off the wage bill. They probably invested about \u00a340million, United\u2019s board.\n\n'That isn\u2019t going to be enough to correct what\u2019s gone before. The club is paying for poor recruitment.\n\n'Some of the players that have been signed have been good players. But if they\u2019re character isn\u2019t right then it\u2019s a bad signing.'", "description": "Gary Neville says Manchester United\u00a0have gone backwards after selling Marouane Fellaini, Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku\u00a0but urged them to 'hold their nerve' with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.", "authors": ["Kishan Vaghela For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/20/19368586-0-image-a-56_1570388563067.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
