The lawsuit, first reported by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , is the latest of several involving use of an inmate restraint chair, a device used to immobilize inmates at risk of hurting themselves or others.\n\nOkal was 41 when he was arrested for driving while intoxicated in December 2016. His attorney, Steve Walsh, said that while in jail, Okal suffered an unexplained manic episode, causing jailers to place him in what's known at the southern Missouri jail as 'The Chair.'\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that at the direction of Wayne County Sheriff Dean Finch, right, jailers held Albert Okal, who is black, left, in the restraint chair for five straight days\n\nOkal says that he was not allowed restroom breaks, forcing him to defecate and urinate in his pants; was forced to wear a blanket over his head for one period of at least 24 hours\n\n'Their solution was to put him in a restraint chair rather than be checked out by a medical officer,' Walsh said Monday.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that at the direction of Wayne County Sheriff Dean Finch, jailers held Okal, who is black, in the restraint chair for five straight days.\n\nWalsh said Okal was not allowed restroom breaks, forcing him to defecate and urinate in his pants; was forced to wear a blanket over his head for one period of at least 24 hours; and remained shackled at the wrists even during meal times, causing jailers to force food and water down his throat.\n\nThe lawsuit said Okal suffered physical pain and emotional trauma.\n\nThe treatment that Okal received allegedly occurred at the tiny rural jail in Wayne County, MO\n\nThe restraint chair allegedly used is similar to the one pictured above whose instructions specifically state that the the chair is not to be used as a means of punishment\n\nA phone message seeking comment from Albert Spradling, the attorney for the county and the other defendants, was not immediately returned.\n\nSpradling wrote in a court document that the defendants believe any damage suffered by Okal was the result of his own 'carelessness and negligence' due to his intoxication and his actions in the jail.\n\nWalsh said Okal, who was born in Kenya, was subjected to repeated racial slurs during his restraint.\n\n'I think sometimes you just get a bad culture in certain institutions,' Walsh said.\n\nOkal eventually spent a short time in prison as a persistent offender. He now lives in St. Louis County.\n\nIn another lawsuit another Missouri man, Williams Ames III, pictured, died in a different county, also while being strapped in the county jail's restraint chair for more than 24 hours and missing several doses of anti-seizure medication\n\nRestraint chairs are common in many jails and prisons nationwide. Some inmates have died after spending time in them.\n\nAmong them was another Missouri man, Williams Ames III, who died November 11 in St. Francois County.\n\nA wrongful death lawsuit claimed Ames was strapped in the county jail's restraint chair for more than 24 hours and missed several doses of anti-seizure medication.\n\nThe suit also alleged that jail workers were told that Ames had swallowed a bag containing a combination of methamphetamine, cocaine and bath salts, but failed to act.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol is investigating Ames' death .\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Ty'rique Riley , 21, died this summer after becoming unresponsive in a restraint chair at the Dauphin County Prison, where he was placed after struggling with guards.\n\nThe coroner ruled Riley died from an inflammation that could have been caused by a virus, cocaine or both, but the death still sparked weeks of protests.\n\nIn Oklahoma, Garfield County inmate Anthony Huff died in 2016 after more than two days in a restraint chair.\n\nAn autopsy blamed chronic alcoholism as the probable cause of death. Huff, 58, had been arrested for public intoxication. The former jail administrator pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter earlier this year and was sentenced to 55 hours in jail.\n\nIn 2015, Mathew Ajibade died in a cell at the Chatham County, Georgia, jail, hours after he was arrested following a fight with his girlfriend.\n\nAjibade was strapped into a restraint chair after fighting with deputies, one of whom used a Taser four times. An autopsy found no single cause for why Ajibade died, but a state investigator testified that the 21-year-old inmate was 'stressed to death.'", "description": "Albert Okal, 41, claims he was strapped to a restraint chair in for five days.
