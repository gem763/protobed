Interns may not have the most glamorous jobs, but they certainly are the first line of defense in any office and ensure operations run smoothly. The key part of being an intern is what comes after, the ability to enter the staffer pipeline.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiOvernight Defense: House approves Turkey sanctions in rebuke of Trump | Trump attacks on Army officer testifying spark backlash | Dems want answers from Esper over Ukraine aid Mark Mellman: Three questions for Republicans White House: Democrats' resolution shows impeachment is 'illegitimate sham' MORE (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellOvernight Defense: House approves Turkey sanctions in rebuke of Trump | Trump attacks on Army officer testifying spark backlash | Dems want answers from Esper over Ukraine aid Mark Mellman: Three questions for Republicans Menendez seeks probe into if Pompeo violated Hatch Act MORE (R-Ky.) do not have much in common except for one thing, they both got their start as interns in Congress. Internships are often the gateway to full-time positions.\n\nAsk any staffer on the Hill and many of them will tell you that they started off as an intern, be it in D.C., the district office or the member\u2019s campaign. Though up until recently, a majority of the congressional internships were unpaid and that meant only a certain type of person was most likely to take an internship opportunity. Who were they? Those who could afford it. Washington, D.C. is one of the most expensive cities in the U.S. and with living expenses associated with a three-month internship costing upwards of $4,000, there are only so many individuals who can afford to work for nothing.\n\nThe interns who can afford the cost end up being hired, rise up in the ranks as communications directors, policy advisors, chiefs of staff or even make the jump and run for office and are elected. Staff are the eyes, ears and sounding boards for members and it matters who they are and what their experiences are. The data also back it up. According to Professor Nicholas Carnes from Duke University, the working class make up nearly half of the country. However, never more than 2 percent of seats in any Congress were held by a middle-class Americans. When the working class is not at the table as staffers or elected officials, Cartnes\u2019 research suggests that policies end up being crafted to benefit a select few and not all Americans.\n\nRight now, when people can\u2019t afford their internship, they either miss out on the opportunity or have to take a second or third job just to make ends meet. That is why Pay Our Interns waged a multi-year campaign to educate congressional members on how unpaid internships further inequality and the benefits of a diverse intern class. Elected officials such as Rep. Ayanna Pressley Ayanna PressleyAyanna Pressley endorses Democrat Henry Cuellar's primary challenger Hillicon Valley: Lawmakers unleash on Zuckerberg | House passes third election interference bill | Online extremism legislation advances in House | Google claims quantum computing breakthrough On The Money: Lawmakers hammer Zuckerberg over Facebook controversies | GOP chair expects another funding stopgap | Senate rejects Dem measure on SALT deduction cap workarounds MORE (D-Mass.) are an example of how an internship can carve your career path. She now holds the seat for the office she first interned while working three other jobs. It underscores the importance of building a diverse intern-to-member pipeline.\n\nWhen you break down the barriers that block marginalized Americans, such as students of color or those of working-class backgrounds, from interning on the Hill we start to see truer representation of our democracy. In the years to come we will begin to see former interns-turned staff assistants apply for the mid-level jobs and many will trace their beginning to the paid internship opportunity they were given because of this opportunity. It is the responsibility of congressional offices to now make sure that students are aware of these new paid opportunities, and meaningfully engage and recruit students of all backgrounds to apply. Government roles should not be only for those who can afford it or who are connected but rather any individual who shows promise, regardless of their zip code, background or socioeconomic status.\n\nThe work Pay Our Interns is doing may not be evident in drastic diverse change now, but in a few years as the pipeline continues to grow with more diversity, we will continue to see more students transition into full-time roles upon graduation.\n\nBeyond Congress, POI is aiming to show all sectors of the workforce the value in investing in their interns and understanding that this expense increases opportunities for all. No one should be made to go into debt or forfeit an opportunity because it is unpaid. Right now the future Speaker of the House or a future chief of staff is interning on the Hill, building a network and gaining the skills they need to be successful.\n\nCarlos Mark Vera is the co-founder of Pay Our Interns and an Echoing Green Fellow.
