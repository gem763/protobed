On Tuesday, she led her team to their fifth consecutive gold medal in the competition, also becoming the most decorated woman with 21 medals. But just two days later, she cruised to a first-place finish by an impressive margin of 2.1 points in the all-around event. And that wasn't all; on Saturday, she claimed the gold in the vault, winning the floor exercise by a full point, tying her position with Belarusian men's gymnast Vitaly Scherbo. Her 25th medal came two hours later with her near-flawless routine on the beam with 15.066 points.\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Simone Biles (@simonebiles) on Aug 12, 2019 at 9:06am PDT", "description": "Simone Arianne Biles breaks all-time record for most medals by any gymnast of any gender at world championships.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/simoneariannebilessm1571045732.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
