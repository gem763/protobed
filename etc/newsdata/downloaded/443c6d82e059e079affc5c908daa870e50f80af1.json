I don\u2019t know how she does it. She goes out and give her all, but she just needs to let go a bit more. I feel like I\u2019m being harsh. It's the second week, let her get into her flow.\"\n\nThen the reality TV star was left red-faced when presenter Gethin Jones joked she was the \"harshest judge\" on the celebrity panel.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nWhile looking at footage of Catherine Tyldesley in training, Gethin asked: \"What do you reckon Amber? I feel like you\u2019re our harshest judge. Go on. Off you go.\"\n\nStunned Amber replied: \"I\u2019m the harshest one? Oh no.\"\n\nThe Love Island favourite realised that Gethin was pulling her leg and put her head in her hands as she keeled over.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nGabby revealed that Amber had been \"worried\" about dishing out criticism to the celeb dancers.\n\nAmber, who also had her say on Alex Jones' rhumba, said: \"I love Moana. It's one of my favourite ever films. I hope she brings more energy and sass to the rhumba.\n\n\"She needs to put more energy into it and let go a bit more.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nShe was also stunned that Will Bayley and his pro partner Janette Manrara would be dancing to the Pokemon theme tune.\n\n\"I don't know how that adds up to a Paso Doble but I'm waiting to see what they do,\" confessed Amber.\n\nAt the end of the show the panel had to predict who would be next to go - and Amber held up a paddle with David James on.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nIt Takes Two viewers loved seeing Amber on the celeb superfan panel, but were annoyed that Rufus took up a lot of the talking time.\n\n\"Oh, great, Rufus Hound. Be ready to not get a word in, ladies,\" said one viewer.\n\nAdded another: \"Yeah I\u2019m a bit behind, but OMG, shut up, Rufus. They weren\u2019t asking you!\"\n\n\"Amber not really getting a word on edgeways on #fridaypanel,\" said a third.\n\nA fourth said: \"Amber from love island on the friday panel, love that for me x\"\n\n*Strictly - It Takes Two airs weeknights on BBC One at 5.15pm", "description": "Love Island winner Amber was worried about upsetting the contestants - but was jokingly called the 'harshest judge' on Strictly - It Takes Two", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20455769.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Embarrassed-Amber-Gill-left-speechless-on-It-Takes-Two-after-being-called-harshest-judge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
