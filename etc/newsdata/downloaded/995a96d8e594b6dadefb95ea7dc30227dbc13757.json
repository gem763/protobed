By way of comparison, 50% of Britons don't fly at all in any one year.\n\nThe levy would also encourage short-haul flights rather than more damaging long-haul flights, shift demand from planes to trains, and raise money that could be used to fund research into low-carbon aviation technology, the report said.\n\n\"Given the scope for frequent flyers to have carbon footprints many times that of the average UK household, a lack of policy in this area is likely to be increasingly seen as inconsistent and unjust and risks damaging public engagement with climate action,\" the report reads.\n\nWhile the report pushes for government policies to tackle emissions, private initiatives have already sprung up.\n\nLast week, International Airlines Group (IAG) -- which includes British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia -- promised to remove or offset all carbon emissions from its fleet of more than 570 aircraft by 2050.\n\nIAG said it would replace older aircraft, invest in sustainable jet fuel and develop technology that removes CO2 from the atmosphere.\n\nAnd some employers have signed up to a program that grants extra paid leave for staff who travel by train rather than plane.", "description": "Air miles programs should be banned and a levy on frequent flyers implemented in order to reduce carbon emissions from aviation, the UK government's climate advisory body has said in a new report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F180523115755-airplanes-contrails-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
