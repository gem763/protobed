So release all the financial records of all businesses involving Biden, Kerry\u2019s stepson and notorious mobster Whitey Bulger\u2019s nephew.\"\n\nGiuliani was referring to Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter; Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry; and James Bulger, the nephew of notorious mobster Whitey Bulger.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reported this week that Hunter Biden's decision to join the board of the Ukrainian firm, Burisma Holdings, back in 2014, was enough to make Heinz, his business partner, raise questions with the State Department and later severed ties with the Biden.\n\nThe New Yorker recently ran an extensive article about Hunter Biden and mentioned several instances where he could have been perceived as using his father's position to help his career. In 2013, Hunter Biden flew with his father to China aboard Air Force 2 before he secured a $1.5 billion deal from a subsidiary of the Bank of China.\n\n\u201cYou want to know why the secretary of state (Kerry) wasn't particularly upset about it? Because his son was getting money too. Isn't it a coincidence that China sends $1.5 billion to a private equity fund? There were only three owners: Biden\u2019s son, Kerry's son, and Whitey Bulger\u2019s nephew,\u201d Giuliani told the Examiner.\n\nGiuliani's tweets came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump focused partly on whether he abused his presidential powers and sought help from a foreign government to undermine Joe Biden and help his own reelection.\n\nIn a summer phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump is accused of asking for help investigating the Bidens. In the days before the call, Trump ordered advisers to freeze $400 million in military aid for Ukraine \u2014 prompting speculation that he was holding out the money as leverage for information on the Bidens. Trump has denied that charge, but acknowledged he blocked the funds, later released.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden said Tuesday, before Pelosi\u2019s announcement, that if Trump doesn\u2019t cooperate with lawmakers\u2019 demands for documents and testimony in its investigations the president \u201cwill leave Congress ... with no choice but to initiate impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Rudy Giuliani, the personal lawyer for President Trump, continued his broadside against the Bidens and their relationship with Ukraine, but also appeared to cast an even wider net,\u00a0 accusing Democrats of doing their best to cover up a \"pattern of corruption\" involving top members of the Obama cabinet.", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
