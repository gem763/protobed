Jacobson, said Monday he received a message from Facebook saying, \u201cYour page has been unpublished,\u201d because it \u201cdoesn\u2019t follow the Facebook Page Policies regarding impersonation and pretending to be an individual or business.\u201d\n\nMr. Jacobson, who also runs the conservative news-and-opinion outlet Legal Insurrection, contested the decision, noting that the page states in its mission that, \u201cWe are not affiliated with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Senate office or any of her campaigns.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe clearly do not violate this policy,\u201d Mr. Jacobson said on Legal Insurrection.\n\nHe said there had been no indication of problems with the page, a companion to his Elizabeth Warren Wiki site, until supporters of Sen. Bernard Sanders, a Warren rival for the 2020 Democratic presidential primary nomination, began citing it on social media.\n\n\u201cIt may be \u2018coincidence\u2019 that just after the Wiki received attention in the looming Bernie-Warren battle, Facebook took down the Wiki\u2019s Facebook page (not the Wiki website, which thankfully Facebook does not control) based on a demonstrably false claim that the page violates Facebook\u2019s \u2018impersonation\u2019 policy,\u201d Mr. Jacobson said.\n\nHe posted tweets from Sanders supporters who linked to information on the Wiki page, including her allegedly plagiarized \u201cPow Wow Chow\u201d cookbook recipe and her claim that she was the \u201cfirst nursing mother\u201d to take the New Jersey bar exam, which a state judiciary official called unverifiable.\n\nJesus. @ewarren claimed to be \u201cthe first nursing mother to take the New jersey Bar Exam\u201d. This was later proved to be false.\n\nI mean, why does she feel she has to keep lying? ALL. THE. TIME.https://t.co/RvfOBmKzZ2 \u2014 EuroYankee is all #Bernie2020 Baby! \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@EuroYankeeBlog) September 27, 2019\n\nMr. Jacobson said he has filed an appeal with Facebook. The Washington Times has reached out to Facebook for comment.\n\n\u201cEven if the page gets restored (hopefully someone with sense at Facebook will look at this), the question remains how this happened, and why a Page that is several years old was taken down without warning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s another reminder, as when our YouTube page was taken down without warning, that we can\u2019t rely on big tech.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren, who has apologized for claiming to be Cherokee while teaching at Harvard Law School despite not being enrolled in a tribal nation, has surged in the 2020 presidential polls, moving ahead of Mr. Sanders and gaining on the front-runner, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\nTwo late September polls \u2014 Quinnipiac and Economist/YouGov \u2014 show her with a slim lead over Mr. Biden but within the margin of error.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
