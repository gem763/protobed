He doesn\u2019t care that most dictionaries list only whoa as the proper spelling.\n\nIn fact, for Mr. Hall, there are only two kinds of people in the world: those who write woah, and \u201cold people.\u201d\n\n\u201cW-h-o-a, that just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he says. He compared it to using the word icebox instead of refrigerator. \u201cIt makes me think of older teachers. It just comes off as a little odd.\u201d\n\nWoah has been used for years as an alternate spelling of whoa, according to online databases. But the usage has ticked up dramatically in recent times, driven by young people who use the term as a social catchphrase. Woah was the preferred spelling of 29 out of 30 teenagers interviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBenjamin Hall, 16, says he associates the spelling \u2018whoa\u2019 with older people.

On Google Trends, which tracks the frequency of search engine terms, woah has been the more dominant term in basic Web and YouTube searches for two years.\n\nCharlotte Knowlton, 20, says text message style reveals a lot about personality.

The Oxford English Dictionary made the change in 2016.\n\nMerriam-Webster bases its decisions on alternate spellings, or \u201cvariants,\u201d on published, edited text, so the rise in the use of woah in news stories has been enough to warrant close consideration, says Emily Brewster, a senior editor at the publisher.\n\n\u201cLanguage change is happening more quickly than ever now,\u201d she says. \u201cI love that playfulness is far more pronounced in published writing than it used to be.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Are you #teamwhoa or #teamwoah? It probably depends on your age. Join the conversation below.\n\nWhoa traditionalists affronted by the alternate spelling see it as yet another example of language degradation due to the explosion of texting and social media.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly right, linguists say\u2014though many prefer to call it evolution, and see no cause for alarm.\n\n\u201cHorror of horrors, if this trend continues, written English language may end up reflecting actual pronunciation,\u201d said William Eggington, a sociolinguist at Brigham Young University.\n\nThe rise of woah is a testament to the growing clout of internet language and the speed with which it can alter word meanings and spellings. The widespread use of texting and social media has created an explosion of conversational writing and language personalization, says Gretchen McCulloch, co-host of a linguistics podcast and author of \u201cBecause Internet.\u201d \u201cAcross many languages, people are trying to write in a way closer to how they talk,\u201d she says.\n\nSam Nitkin, 19, who uses \u2018woah\u2019 in text messages and social media, says dictionaries should conform to match the way people communicate.

The original definition of whoa is \u201cstop,\u201d and the word originated as an exclamation used for horses. Its use as an expression of surprise dates to the 1980s, where it was popularized in movies such as \u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High\u201d and \u201cBill and Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure,\u201d as well as in the TV sitcom \u201cBlossom.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, a number of popular songs and dance memes have helped fuel the rise of woah, which is more elongated when spoken and conveys a greater sense of astonishment.\n\nTechnology is playing a role in woah\u2019s assimilation. Although many have come to expect rigidity from auto-correct and auto-complete software on mobile devices, technology companies are using software and language experts to inform decisions on what words to correct and what words to leave unchanged.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be stuffy and say, you have to spell it like this,\u201d says Daan van Esch, who works on speech processing technology at Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google. It doesn\u2019t auto-correct woah in its Android keyboard, which has been installed on more than 1 billion devices. \u201cWe want people to spell it in whatever way they want to.\u201d\n\nTeenagers interviewed by the Journal say they often adjust word spellings, punctuation and other phrases in text based on their mood or who they are speaking with.\n\nPamela Terrell, who researches language impairments in children, says the \"woah\" spelling doesn't follow rules and patterns in English. Photo: Pamela Terrell\n\nMany stress that they use woah because it allows them to tack on \u201ch\u201d a few more times at the end\u2014\u201cwoahhhh\u201d\u2014to be more emphatic about their surprise or wonder.\n\nA number of teenagers say spelling in text messages and social media posts is a reflection of personality. The slightest nuances of punctuation can indicate anger, or formality.\n\n\u201cYou can tell so much about somebody just by the way they talk and write and present themselves in texts and online,\u201d says Charlotte Knowlton, a 20-year old from Gloucester, Mass.\n\nTo Sam Nitkin, a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of Chicago, reference books only matter so much when it comes to words such as woah.\n\n\u201cI use language the way I want to use it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe dictionary should change to match me, and not the other way around.\u201d\n\nWrite to Bradley Olson at Bradley.Olson@wsj.com", "description": "Fueled by memes and texting, \u2018woah\u2019 catches on as the preferred spelling for \u2018whoa\u2019 among young people.
