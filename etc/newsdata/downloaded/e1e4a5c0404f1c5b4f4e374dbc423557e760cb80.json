The spyware, named Pegasus, features advanced capabilities to jailbreak or root the infected mobile device, and turn on the phone\u2019s microphone and camera, scan emails and messages, and collect all sorts of sensitive information.\n\nCredit: Amnesty International A man-in-the-middle attack targeting Moroccan human rights activist Ma\u00e2ti Monjib\n\nBack in July, it emerged that the tool had \u201cevolved to capture the much greater trove of information stored beyond the phone in the cloud, such as a full history of a target\u2019s location data, archived messages or photo.\u201d\n\nIn May, the FT discovered a vulnerability in WhatsApp\u2019s audio call feature that allowed attackers to inject iPhones and Androids with Pegasus. This prompted the Facebook-owned messaging service to issue a server-side update to patch the exploit.\n\nThen last week, Google\u2019s Project Zero uncovered evidence of an actively exploited privilege escalation Android zero-day \u2014 allegedly said to have been used or sold by the NSO Group \u2014 that gave attackers the ability to compromise millions of devices. It\u2019s not fully clear who the targets were in either of those attacks.\n\nAlthough NSO group has maintained that its software is only sold to responsible governments to help foil terrorist attacks and crimes, the latest incident is a reminder that Pegasus has been repeatedly misused to track human rights activists and journalists around the world.\n\n\u201cSubjecting peaceful critics and activists who speak out about Morocco\u2019s human rights records to harassment or intimidation through invasive digital surveillance is an appalling violation of their rights to privacy and freedom of expression,\u201d Amnesty International added.\n\nNSO Group, for its part, put out a human rights policy in September that aims to \u201cidentify, prevent and mitigate the risks of adverse human rights impact.\u201d It also said the tools are not meant to \u201csurveil dissidents or human rights activists\u201d \u2014\n\nAs per our policy, we investigate reports of alleged misuse of our products. If an investigation identifies actual or potential adverse impacts on human rights, we are proactive and quick to take the appropriate action to address them. This may include suspending or immediately terminating a customer\u2019s use of the product, as we have done in the past.\n\nAt this point, the events directly connecting the man-in-the-middle attack to NSO Group are circumstantial at best. But the findings are indicative of sustained attempts by governments and bad actors to spy on activists and journalists.\n\n\u201cInstead of attempting to whitewash human rights violations associated with NSO products, the company must urgently put in place more effective due diligence processes to stop its spyware being abused,\u201d the NGO concluded.\n\nRead next: Who needs iCloud or iTunes? iMazing does all your iOS device cleanup for $19.99.", "description": "Two prominent Moroccan human rights activists have been targeted with sophisticated spyware built by NSO Group at least since 2017, according to Amnesty.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fmorocco-hack-hed.jpg&signature=1814dd0e23fd8e14566cb8b1a1044f92", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
