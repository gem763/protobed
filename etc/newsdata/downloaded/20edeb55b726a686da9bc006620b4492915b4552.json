Mahomes told Hardman just to run his route as fast as he could, and that would take care of things.\n\n\u201cI think it was just him finding the speed of the game,\u201d Mahomes said, via the Kansas City Star. \u201cHe\u2019s still a young guy, and it\u2019s just his second game in the league. He realized that he has to be fast with his cuts. He kinda tried to sell it a little bit more with a nod, and he was open, but it was late, and the pressure was there. So I just told him, you have to speed it up. You have to play with that speed; use your speed. You saw him the rest of the game \u2014 he sped it up and made big plays for us.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Hardman used his speed to catch a 42-yard touchdown pass. Those are the kinds of plays that made the Chiefs draft Hardman with their first pick in this year\u2019s draft. Mahomes wants Hardman to keep it up.", "description": "Chiefs rookie wide receiver Mecole Hardman is plenty fast, but Patrick Mahomes wants him playing even faster.
