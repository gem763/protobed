England are still not publicly ruling him out of appearing in his 13th consecutive Test of the year against France in Yokohama on Saturday but with qualification for the quarter-finals already assured it is almost certain he will be omitted. Mark Wilson, who was absent from the matchday 23, is standing by.\n\nRugby World Cup pool permutations: who needs what in the last week? Read more\n\nThe 26-year-old Vunipola was not able to take part in Tuesday morning\u2019s training session and, while England are keeping details to a minimum, they have opted against sending him home and summoning a replacement, suggesting a decision will be made on his availability for the knockout stages next week. \u201cWe are being overly cautious and if there is any risk that Billy is not going to be 100% we will rest him,\u201d said England\u2019s attack coach Scott Wisemantel.\n\nDoubts have emerged, however, over whether Saturday\u2019s match will go ahead with Super Typhoon Hagibis changing course and heading for Tokyo and Yokohama over the weekend. The typhoon had initially been set to cause disruption to Ireland\u2019s key Pool A match with Russia in Fukuoka but now appears headed for the capital. Yokohama, where Japan face Scotland on Sunday, is also under threat for what has been described as the most explosive typhoon of the year by the Japanese meteorological agency.\n\nBoth England and France have already qualified for the quarter-finals, meaning there would be less of an impact on permutations if the match is cancelled and the result deemed to be a scoreless draw. Japan\u2019s match against Scotland however is key in determining which two teams reach the last eight. World Cup organisers do have contingency plans, including potentially relocating matches to different venues, but if they end up being cancelled, both sides are awarded two points.\n\n\u201cRegarding the typhoon we have no control over the weather and we have to prepare for the game and see how it goes.\u201d added Wisemantel. \u201cRegarding the permutation around the game and shared points we are just concentrating on playing to win. I live in a bubble and I don\u2019t know where the game would be played. One thing I have learnt in Japan is that they prepare for the worst and then usually it doesn\u2019t eventuate.\u201d", "description": "England will not take a risk with Billy Vunipola against France after the No 8 suffered a twisted ankle last weekend but remain hopeful he will play a further part in their World Cup campaign", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3596107e061e40040a65efed1d206d1264031fe3/390_0_3521_2113/master/3521.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a2d7fa81406b4fd90a6ff026f8109797", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
