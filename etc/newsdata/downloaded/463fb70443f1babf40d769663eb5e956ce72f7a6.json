HP is by far the UK\u2019s leading brown-sauce brand, yes, but there are others, including Daddies, Chef in Ireland and A1 in the US.\n\nHow lucky we all are, to be able to delight ourselves with such sweet industrial bounty. Yes, maybe. Although people don\u2019t seem to realise. According to the trade magazine the Grocer, UK sales of brown sauce fell 2.8% by value in the year leading up to May 2019.\n\nThat\u2019s shocking! No it isn\u2019t. Brown sauce is a condiment in decline. Sales fell 19% in 2014 alone.\n\nWhat could explain this terrible trend? The fact that it\u2019s disgusting.\n\nOh, grow up. If brown sauce was disgusting, why did so many British people cover their food with it for more than 100 years? Because their food was even more disgusting.\n\nPiffle! These things are just a matter of taste. Give me some proper reasons. Well, one theory is that British people might be eating fewer cooked breakfasts and bacon sandwiches, where brown sauce can traditionally be found.\n\nThat\u2019s possible. And arguably the picture of the Houses of Parliament on the HP label has begun to put people off their food.\n\nThat\u2019s highly likely. Just don\u2019t tell me that the dreaded ketchup is taking over. It isn\u2019t. Not really. Ketchup and salad cream sales are basically flat. It\u2019s the fancy foreign stuff that\u2019s doing well.\n\nLike what? Mayonnaise, for one thing. That\u2019s up more than 10%, partly because it can be flavoured with other things, especially chilli. Hot sauces in general are doing well.\n\nDear me. Brown sauce and ketchup are going to be endangered species at this rate! I wouldn\u2019t worry about that just yet. They were still worth \u00a348m and \u00a3153m respectively last year.\n\nSo you\u2019re saying that Britain\u2019s taste in condiments shows us a country that is becoming rapidly more open-minded and cosmopolitan in outlook, but where many people still prefer things the way they used to be? That\u2019s right.\n\nYou would never know it to look at us, would you? You would have absolutely no idea.\n\nDo say: \u201cWhen we get a no-deal Brexit, it will put a stop to all this sriracha nonsense flooding into the country. Then we can finally get back to our indigenous sauces.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cI thought HP sauce was owned by an American company, Heinz, which makes it in, and ships it from the Netherlands?\u201d", "description": "Brown sauce has lost yet more ground in the condiment sales wars, as the British have their heads turned by fancy foreign stuff", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dae4d0b18bed79656a92274bb625e5218917b391/0_171_3572_2144/master/3572.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a1b526e30cf747216b8833cbaae166c9", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
