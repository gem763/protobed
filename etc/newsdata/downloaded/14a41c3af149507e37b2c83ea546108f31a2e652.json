She put her glasses on, she took her glasses off, she clutched her notes.\n\nShe ignored her friend and neighbour on the green benches, Ken Clarke, mouthing, \u2018Not now\u2019.\n\nAt one point, the former Prime Minister walked out of the chamber \u2013 she was wearing that old pair of leopard-print flat pumps \u2013 and then returned.\n\nWas it all too much, a return to the scene of so much heartbreak?\n\nBut then all became clear when, on one of the few occasions since she\u2019d tearfully left office, Mrs May stood up to address a packed House of Commons.\n\nYou could have heard a pin drop. Necks craned, ears strained. MPs even stopped tweeting. A miracle.\n\nAnd do you know what? She smashed it. She was like a new woman. Clear as a bell, too: no sore throat caused by endless arguments with intransigent men.\n\nInstead, we got lashings of passion and even a little joke: \u2018I feel a distinct sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u2026\u2019\n\nTheresa May said: \u2018I feel a distinct sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u2026\u2019 as Boris Johnson replied: \u2018I know how you feel'\n\nbrexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.\n\n\u2018I know how you feel,\u2019 replied Boris Johnson. As did we all.\n\nThis was supposed to be Super Saturday history in the making, Parliament sitting at the weekend for the first time in a generation, an end at last to all the agony. And then it all started to go very, very wrong. Again.\n\nMr Johnson had emerged at 9.30 in the morning, bouncing on his toes like a prize fighter. Hair freshly Timotei\u2019d.\n\nBad news was filtering through the ancient walls as clearly as the shouts from the People\u2019s Vote protesters outside.\n\nSir Oliver Letwin \u2013 former Tory MP and official thorn \u2013 was demanding yet another delay to Brexit. And his amendment looked likely to succeed.\n\nShe smashed it. She was like a new woman. Clear as a bell, too: no sore throat caused by endless arguments with intransigent men\n\nMrs May pictured with Father of the House Ken Clarke demanded MPs who are planning to oppose the deal 'put the national interest first' and honour the will of the public\n\nAll Boris\u2019s promises of \u2018getting over the line\u2019 would be meaningless. We were trapped in a game of ping-pong, only far less fun. With punctured balls.\n\n\u2018My fear is the deal tonight will not be meaningful,\u2019 said Boris, and everyone groaned. Mainly at the word \u2018tonight\u2019. Never mind the state of the economy, weekends had been wrecked.\n\nThe Prime Minister stuck to his task manfully, issuing all those phrases we\u2019ve heard so many times before. We need to move forward. We need to get Brexit done.\n\nMPs glanced at their watches, bottoms shifted and Andrea Leadsom sent a tweet about the progress of the rugby. Both sides of the House looked exhausted.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn creaked to his feet to talk about workers\u2019 rights and at that exact moment his deputy Tom Watson and Theresa May reached for their phones and started scrolling. The ultimate casual put-down.\n\nWhen Speaker John Bercow confirmed he had indeed selected Letwin\u2019s amendment for a vote in the afternoon \u2013 \u2018What a surprise!\u2019 cried the Tory benches \u2013 despair swept round the chamber like a virtual Mexican wave. And three hours later, MPs were still bickering. Jo Swinson\u2019s gold shoes sparkled in the autumn sunlight. A wag shouted, \u2018Where\u2019s yer off switch\u2019 at the SNP\u2019s loquacious Ian Blackford. Michael Gove handed out mints to the Labour front bench, for all the world as though it were Christmas Day in the trenches. But there would be no ceasefire, right now. Gove summed it all up by telling us what we\u2019d suspected all day long: there would be no meaningful vote on Brexit if the Letwin amendment is passed today.\n\nNooooo!!!\n\nThank goodness for Mrs May, papers flapping, who got the biggest cheer of the difficult day and a standing ovation. She was loyal not just to her old shoes but to her new leader, too.\n\n\u2018When this House voted overwhelmingly to give the choice of our membership of the EU to the British people, did we really mean it?\u2019 she asked. \u2018When we voted to trigger Article 50, did we really mean it? When the two main parties represented in this House, stood on manifestos in the 2017 General Election to deliver Brexit, did we really mean it?\n\n\u2018I think there can only be one answer to that and that is: yes, we did mean it, yes, we keep faith with the British people, yes, we want to deliver Brexit, because if this Parliament did not mean it, then it is guilty of the most egregious con trick on the British people.\u2019\n\nThen at 2.30pm came the moment for the Letwin vote, the point at which it all became pointless. The chants of the protesters outside, all watching on tiny screens, grew louder and it felt as if we were under siege.\n\n\u2018Lock the door!\u2019 bellowed the Speaker as MPs filed back in. So reassuring, all the ceremony \u2013 as if things will work out, one day.\n\nBut not on this day because: \u2018The Ayes have it! The Ayes have it!\u2019\n\nLetwin and the wreckers had done their worst.\n\nAt the end of it all, Boris managed a watery smile. He was given a reassuring pat from Matt Hancock, as if he were going out to bat for his country. Which of course he is. Just not today.", "description": "LIZ JONES: Theresa May had been looking jittery all morning. She put her glasses on, she took her glasses off, she clutched her notes.
