It\u2019s for kindergartners and first- and second-graders.", "language": "en", "text": "Critics find the idea appalling. But Hill and her school system in Charles County are pushing ahead, sparking a debate that has touched on racial disparities, children\u2019s well-being, classroom disruptions, legal issues and community trust.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe just need a chance to open and show everyone what a good program this will be,\u201d Hill, the schools superintendent in Charles County, said as she surveyed progress on building renovations one recent day.\n\nAD\n\nHill and others say the alternative school will be small and well staffed, with a therapeutic focus. It is not intended to punish students, they say, but to help them learn to regulate emotions and behaviors and return to their home schools.\n\nOpponents see harm rather than help \u2014 arguing that it will label children as troubled when they have just started out. They assert children so young should not be removed from their home schools, and they say the plan will have the effect of segregating black students, who are disproportionately suspended and expelled in Charles County.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou are setting our children up for a lifetime of stigma by separating them from their peers, particularly at such a young age,\u201d Chanell Gaines, an African American mother of three young sons, told the county school board at a hearing several months ago.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are sending the message that our children don\u2019t belong, that something is wrong with them,\u201d she said.\n\nSeveral state lawmakers have been critical of the school \u2014 called Fresh Start Academy \u2014 as have advocates with the Charles County branch of the NAACP, Disability Rights Maryland and several other state and national advocacy organizations.\n\n\u201cThis issue has opened a wound in our community,\u201d said Dyotha Sweat, president of the county branch of the NAACP, who said she finds it \u201cbarbaric\u201d to create a separate school in the 27,000-student system rather than add specialists and resources to traditional schools.\n\nAD\n\nElsewhere in Maryland, some school systems have alternative programs for younger students, but approaches are varied.\n\nBarbara Fedders, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who has studied alternative schools, said she is skeptical that enough meaningful data exists on children so young to suggest the need for a separate placement. Also, she pointed out, not every child starts school with the benefit of prekindergarten, which helps with adjustment.\n\nAD\n\nResearch on alternative schools across all grade levels, Fedders said, shows problems at many schools nationally: \u201cThey do not improve academic outcomes, they contribute to student disengagement, and they fuel segregation by race and disability status,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nCharles County education leaders say that their school will be voluntary, used when other interventions are exhausted, and that they will involve parents throughout the process. Children would stay a minimum of four weeks but possibly several months.\n\nThey say they hope their program will spur others in Maryland to follow their lead.\n\n\u201cWe are anticipating that we will be a model for the state and that we will have folks coming to see the success of our program and our students,\u201d said Amy Hollstein, the deputy superintendent of schools and a leader on the project.\n\nAD\n\nShe noted an increased focus nationally on children with adverse childhood experiences who need extra support.\n\nAD\n\nAdvocacy organizations opposing the school worry Charles County is circumventing a state law passed in 2017 that banned suspensions and expulsions of young children, except under narrow circumstances.\n\nSuspended from school in early grades\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want this to become the new workaround for dealing with behavior problems,\u201d said Renuka Rege, an attorney with the nonprofit Public Justice Center, which has joined other groups opposing the school.\n\nHill, the Charles superintendent, disputes any such suggestion. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not a way to circumvent any state law. That\u2019s not how we operate.\u201d\n\nFresh Start Academy, to cost $452,000 a year, is slated to enroll six to eight students at any time in its first \u201cpilot\u201d year. Building renovations were $429,000, with plans for a calming \u201csensory room\u201d and three classrooms, each with two-way observation windows, to allow others to learn from strategies being used.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCharles County school officials said they do not have money or space to bring a similar program into the system\u2019s 22 elementary schools \u2014 as many critics have urged. They said they have made changes in response to concerns and named a community advisory panel.\n\n\u201cThe goal of this program is not to segregate, or to make a child feel like a bad kid,\u201d said Hill, a onetime principal who has been at the helm as superintendent for six years. \u201cIt\u2019s really to help them gain some skills to successfully transition back to the regular school.\u201d\n\nSchool board chairman Virginia McGraw said she sees Fresh Start as an early intervention that will improve a student\u2019s chances for success and help prevent alternative-school enrollment down the line.\n\nAD\n\nCritics may not realize the carefully thought-out and documented process involved in selecting students, she said; at least 30 days of behavioral data will be examined.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI want to be proactive if we see a child who needs supports,\u201d she said.\n\nSeveral teachers speaking out in support of the new school at the hearing described chaos in their classrooms, recalling when a child had thrown chairs, toppled desks or assaulted classmates or educators. Other students miss learning time, they said.\n\nKi\u2019Tira Shorter, a first-grade teacher at Berry Elementary School, spoke of having to \u201cmaster the art of evacuating my classroom\u201d because of \u201cdangerous disruptions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese students, who are clearly calling out for more help by destroying classrooms, assaulting teachers and running away, will learn strategies to manage their emotions and impulses at the Fresh Start Academy by teachers who will care and love for them,\u201d she said.\n\nParent Jai Branch said her daughter was hit in the face with a book one day in first grade when a classmate had an outburst. The class was often evacuated to the library, she said.\n\nAD\n\nTeachers are not trained therapists, she said, and some students are traumatized, needing more intensive support. She is not sure whether Fresh Start is the answer, she said, but \u201cwe can\u2019t continue to ignore what\u2019s happening. And is it fair to all the rest of the kids in the class? People should be working together.\u201d\n\nCritics have complained that school officials told the public about the program after it was already in the making and without providing data or research to back up their plan.\n\nThey agree that students and teachers need more support but say a separate school is not the way to go.\n\nMany see race as an issue, pointing out that while black children account for 55 percent of students in Charles County, they represent nearly 80 percent of students suspended and expelled, according to the most recent state data.\n\nAD\n\nMost teachers are white, as is true in many school systems.\n\nDel. Debra M. Davis (D-Charles County) also cites a lack of diversity in school system leadership. Identifying and separating children at an early age contributes to a school-to-prison pipeline, she argued.\n\n\u201cIt targets black, brown and poor kids,\u201d she said.\n\nJames Person, a father of three, said the school system is too quick to label black boys as disciplinary problems rather than looking deeper at their social, emotional or academic struggles. He said his son might have been selected for the alternative school if it had been operating when he was in the early grades.\n\n\u201cWe know what that school is going to look like: It\u2019s going to be 90 percent black,\u201d he said.\n\nPerson also said he is stunned by the age of the children who would be enrolled at Fresh Start. \u201cEighteen months before, you might have been changing their diapers. They were just starting to walk and run. And now you want to put them in alternative school?\u201d\n\nAnother parent, Esther Williams, said children so young are unformed. \u201cThey are still trying to find themselves,\u201d she said.\n\nHill said the idea for the school goes back three years, when principals reported an increase in children with excessive, disruptive and dangerous behaviors. \u201cWe started to monitor this and brainstorm and look around for what was going on in other districts,\u201d she said.\n\nOne inspiration came from the northern part of the state, she said.\n\nFor more than 15 years, Carroll County has run an alternative program called P.R.I.D.E. for children in kindergarten to fifth grade. It is located in a portable classroom at an elementary school, and students are integrated with the rest of the campus for activities including lunch, recess and art, said Cynthia A. McCabe, chief of schools in Carroll County. Students typically spend eight weeks to four months in the program, which enrolls about 30 children a year.\n\nMost students who participate go back to their home schools and are successful, McCabe said.\n\nThe debate in Charles County took a legal turn in the spring, as two state lawmakers asked the counsel to the General Assembly to weigh in on the legality of the new school, given the 2017 suspension ban for students in prekindergarten to second grade.\n\nIn a six-page letter on May 31, counsel Sandra Benson Brantley found the school would not comply with state law. An attorney hired by the school board responded with a June 28 opinion that took issue with some points, noted the program was changed to become voluntary and concluded it did not violate the law.\n\nThe legal questions have tied up county funding, but the school system says the project is legal and has moved ahead using funds from its operating budget. Children are expected to be placed at Fresh Start in November.\n\nOpponents worry that families won\u2019t feel they have a real choice if their child is recommended for Fresh Start and that children with disabilities may be wrongly placed there. It is located at the Robert D. Stethem Educational Center, a campus that includes an alternative school for older students and career programs. Fresh Start is part of a building that houses a virtual learning program.\n\nDerek W. Black, a law professor at the University of South Carolina and author of a book on school discipline, said he was skeptical there are enough students in kindergarten to second grade \u201cengaging in behaviors serious enough to fill up an alternative school.\u201d\n\nIf behavior is exceptionally severe, he added, students may have an undiagnosed disability \u2014 which federal law would generally require schools to address with services in a regular school setting.\n\n\u201cTo me, it seems highly unlikely that this is an appropriate response,\u201d Black said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have kids at that age bringing knives to school and starting fires.\u201d\n\nJennifer Jenkins contributed to this report.\n\nThe money was fake. The police were real. It happened in an elementary school.\n\nJudge Steve Teske seeks to keep kids with minor problems out of court\n\nResolution, years later, in boy\u2019s suspension over \u2018pastry gun\u2019\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "A Maryland program hopes to be a model.
