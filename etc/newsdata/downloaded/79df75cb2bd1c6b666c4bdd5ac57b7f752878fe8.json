Critics, on the other hand, see corporate influence at work.\n\nThere are 419 national parks in the United States, from the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to the Gates of the Arctic in Alaska. All are overseen by the National Park Service, which is part of the Interior Department. That bureau is headed by David Bernhardt, a former Republican operative and corporate lobbyist who has made no secret of his desire to increase the presence of private enterprise in national parks.\n\nPrivate businesses \u2014 including concessionaires and tour guides \u2014 already operate in many national parks, but Bernhardt and a number of his deputies have argued that the parks have $12 billion in deferred maintenance, and that such funds are much more easily found from outside the federal government than within.\n\nScenic view of Brooks Range, Dietrich River and the Dalton Highway, Gates of the Arctic National Park & Preserve, Arctic Alaska.

They argue that the Trump administration has exaggerated the need to raise funds in order to justify the sale and lease of public lands outside the national park system, as well as favorable terms for concessionaires inside the parks. Some of the nation\u2019s biggest concessionaires, such as Delaware North, are headed by significant donors to Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nThe Sept. 24 memorandum, which was written for the Department of the Interior\u2019s Subcommittee on Recreation Enhancement Through Reorganization, says that privatization should begin as a pilot program \u201cin park units with low levels of visitor services.\u201d But eventually that program would be exported to other agencies within the Interior Department that manage public lands, including the Bureau of Land Management and the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nThe memo was subsequently posted to the internet, where it appears to have attracted no notice.\n\nThe topic of the memorandum is \u201ccampground modernization/expansion.\u201d Although there is no author cited in the two-page document, a metadata analysis performed by conservationist groups that first came upon the file shows that it was written by Derrick Crandall, president of the American Recreation Coalition.\n\nIn a phone conversation with Yahoo News, Crandall confirmed that he was the \u201cchief author\u201d of the memo. He said it has been approved by the appropriate committee and will be endorsed by Bernhardt shortly. Interior officials disputed that characterization, telling Yahoo News, \u201cWe have not received formal recommendations from the committee for the department's consideration. We\u2019ll review the report once we receive it and respond accordingly.\u201d A staffer at Interior headquarters said that Crandall\u2019s memorandum was set to undergo additional review and revision, including public deliberation.", "description": "The Trump administration is moving forward with an ambitious plan to give private businesses greater access to national parks, according to a memorandum written by an advisory council for the Department of the Interior.
