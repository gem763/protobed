We have come a long way as a country and we now have to move with the times.\u201d\n\nMokoena added that he hoped to use his newly acquired knowledge to help improve sports administration.\n\n\u201cThe aim is to improve the administration of sports at large and to encourage athletes to supplement their sporting talent with education in order to remain relevant in sport as they mature into adults.\n\n\u201cWe need to encourage our athletes to study as we need more educated administrators,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAlthough Mokoena has been keeping a low profile since he left Safa in 2004, he says he was never lost to sport.\n\nHe has been chairperson of the Basketball National League for the past seven years.\n\n\u201cSport is in my blood and I will always play a role wherever I am needed. I just took a back seat, but I was always involved in the background because I want to play a meaningful role in improving lives,\u201d he said.\n\nMokoena currently owns the Soweto Panthers basketball club as well as the Soweto Panthers football club.\n\n\u201cComing from humble beginnings, where I used to pick stuff from the Maraisburg and Florida dump sites, I have seen what education can do to emancipate one from poverty. To affirm the principles of personal development, I studied leadership coaching and followed this up with a doctoral degree in business administration, specialising in knowledge management,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cRegardless of your life challenges or the successes that you achieve in your various disciplines \u2013 especially in sports, where mixed fortunes are prevalent \u2013 whether you are a player or an administrator, education is a great way to focus the mind and complement the street wisdom that would have been the pinnacle of your excellence.\u201d", "description": "From being known simply as Ali to being addressed as Mr Mokoena to being now hailed as Dr Mokoena, Safa\u2019s former chief executive has come a long way.", "authors": ["Timothy Molobi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9371/b765edba5d4b4936a24a67eeddd0d56e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
