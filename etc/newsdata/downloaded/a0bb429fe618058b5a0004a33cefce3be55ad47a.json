'I then talked to Sir Graham Henry and Conrad Smith about 2007 and we mentioned the fact it's no different, the same gutting feeling.\n\n'Then Ted and I talked about how well George Ford had played. Ted had quite a few comments and I did a bit of listening, trying to do a bit of learning, and then you just move on don't you?\n\n'Is it hard to stomach? Course it is. It's gut-wrenching because we wanted to win the thing but so did they. Life's not fair so why would sport be fair. You don't always get the thing you want.\n\nHansen consoles Sonny Bill Williams and his team-mates after New Zealand bowed out\n\n'And when you don't you've got to measure your character on how you deal with that.'\n\nHe said his players did not underestimate the threat England posed and that the team knew they would be in for a fight, admitting that they lost to the better side.\n\n'This England team hasn't just snuck up and poked us in the face,' he added.\n\n'It didn't take us by surprise, we knew we were in for a hell of a battle. We played them last year, managed to win by a point. It was a titanic struggle.\n\nEddie Jones shows respect to his opposite number Hansen after England ran out winners\n\n'They were coming into this tournament over the last four years with a massive amount of pain themselves. The massive adversity of not even making the quarter-finals of their own tournament (in 2015) hurt them.\n\n'They've been working and working their butts off, probably more than any other England team in history. We got what we expected and we just have to acknowledge that on the night, they did things a little better than we did.'", "description": "England produced a superb performance to beat the pre-tournament favourites 19-7 to reach the final for the first time since 2007, and Hansen was emotional as he reflected on the defeat.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/11/20242354-0-image-a-85_1572177009320.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
