He calls it AltStore, and it\u2019s an alternative to Apple\u2019s App Store that distributes software Testut says may \u201cpush the boundaries of iOS.\u201d In particular, it supports Testut\u2019s own Nintendo emulator, called Delta, which will let anyone with an iPhone or iPad play Super Mario and other classics. Also, it doesn\u2019t require you jailbreak your iOS device. Anyone can download AltStore right now.\n\nTestut released AltStore earlier today in an early preview form. The full application launches on Saturday, September 28th, with Testut\u2019s full Delta emulator as one of the available apps within the store. It\u2019s already available as an open source project on GitHub.\n\nRelated How an iOS developer built an alternative App Store for the iPhone\n\nFor now, a version of Delta, called Delta Lite, is available in the preview that supports NES games. Testut says the full version will support SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo 64 platforms, with more to come. And thanks to iOS 13\u2019s Sony DualShock 4 and Xbox One support, announced back at WWDC earlier this summer, you can play those games with a standard game console controller or with any MFi-supported gamepad.\n\nVery excited to officially announce AltStore: an alternative app store for iOS \u2014 no jailbreak required. Launching this Saturday, September 28, but you can download the preview TODAY https://t.co/M7nULBV28p \u2014 Riles \u200d\u2642\ufe0f (@rileytestut) September 25, 2019\n\nYou may be wondering how exactly Testut is able to distribute not just his own emulator app, but also his own entire alternative app store. It\u2019s a simple but resilient method, Testut says, and it builds off years of exploits and other tricks the iOS developer and jailbreak communities have concocted to bypass Apple\u2019s restrictions. Testut in fact notably exposed one of those tricks back in 2014, when he used the Apple Developer Enterprise Program designed to allow businesses to internally distribute software as a way to let anyone install his earlier Nintendo emulator, GBA4iOS.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple has become more restrictive around the enterprise program in recent years, especially after it discovered Facebook and Google were both misusing the program to distribute VPN apps to regular consumers in violation of Apple\u2019s developer rules. The enterprise program is also under full Apple control, meaning the company can revoke access to it from anyone at any time. Testut says he has a new method that may be a bit harder to shut down.\n\nApps installed this way normally expire after 7 days (unless you\u2019re an Apple developer), but AltStore will automatically refresh them for you in the background whenever it\u2019s on the same WiFi as AltServer. \u2014 Riles \u200d\u2642\ufe0f (@rileytestut) September 25, 2019\n\nIt does involve installing the companion AltServer application on your Mac or Windows PC, plugging in your iOS device, and manually installing the AltStore software on the phone or tablet. That requires you also input your Apple ID with an app-specific password, which can be generated online from Apple\u2019s dedicated Apple ID management portal.\n\nThat said, once the software is on your phone, it\u2019s indistinguishable from software you\u2019ve developed yourself, compiled in Xcode, and installed on your own device, Testut says. AltStore also uses iTunes Wi-Fi sync to ensure the app refreshes weekly, to avoid being forcibly removed from your device after seven days in accordance with how apps not installed through the App Store function on iOS. (Beta software using TestFlight or the enterprise program function differently.)\n\nIn that sense, it works very much like the existing Cydia Impactor tool for installing iOS application files. Yet instead of just letting you install random app files, it installs an entire app store capable of distributing its own secondary software.\n\nAltStore works by tricking Apple into thinking you\u2019ve developed the app yourself\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Apple can\u2019t shut it down. It may have some method of doing so, but Testut says he\u2019s not sure it would be easy for Apple to do so without also removing the ability for DIY developers, schools, and other organizations that rely on that foundational iOS infrastructure to build test apps and software for internal use.\n\n\u201cIt would be interesting, because everything I\u2019m doing, Apple is doing themselves,\u201d Tesut told The Verge of the project earlier this year, when it was still in development. \u201cOne heavy-handed approach is they [Apple] could completely shut down the whole service, but that would affect everyone doing this, including schools. Anyone just using their free Apple ID on the side.\u201d\n\nBesides that, Testut imagines Apple could disable the ability to sync over Wi-Fi, but that would just mean plugging in your phone once a week to continue using AltStore and the apps it distributes. \u201cI don\u2019t know how fast they\u2019d react and what they would do, but even in the worst case, I think there\u2019s still a path forward for AltStore. As long as iTunes can sync apps, Alt Store can work,\u201d he said.", "description": "Riley Testut, an iOS app developer who has for years worked on mobile video game emulation, just released a project that has the potential to shake up the entire iOS ecosystem.
