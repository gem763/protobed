The family were taken to a safe location while the seventh person - Austrian Josef B, 58 - was arrested.\n\nJosesef B, known as 'Josef the Austrian' will appear in court on Thursday, as it emerged the family can barely talk and speak in a 'fantasy language' after spending nine years in isolation.\n\nOfficers found his four brothers and sisters, aged between 18 and 25, along with their father in a room hidden behind a staircase in Ruinerwold, 60 miles north of Amsterdam\n\nInvestigators today revealed they had difficulty understanding the victims, with parts of their speech deemed 'incomprehensible' - and said they slept and ate on the floor in a room with no windows, according to local reports.\n\nDespite sharing a 'small, enclosed space' with no natural light, police confirmed the family were not malnourished and looked 'normal'.\n\nInvestigators admit they are still deeply puzzled by the case and are still working to answer key questions - such as whether the family were held against their will by Josef B.\n\nHowever more details may emerge when he appears in court for the remand hearing, after being charged with the deprivation of liberty and prejudicing the health of others.\n\nNeighbours told local media they were puzzled by the man - described as a skilled 'wood-worker' - as it emerged the 'odd-jobs-man' had asked neighbours for renovation tips such as laying concrete and appeared to have renovated the isolated home alone.\n\nOfficers raided this property on Sunday where they discovered Jan's family living in an 'enclosed space'. Josef B, 58, who rented the property, was arrested\n\nJospef B would reportedly ask locals for tips on building and construction but would not elaborate on where he lived or with whom.\n\nOne local told Bild newspaper: 'The man has renovated all this alone, came with his trailer and building materials. I've always wondered \"how can he do it all on his own?\"\n\n'He must have had help, it can not be done on his own.'\n\nResidents also claim Josef B had surveillance cameras around the property, kept the gate locked and peered through binoculars.\n\nHe would reportedly 'chase' people away that strayed too close to the house.\n\nJan Zon van Dorsten, 25, is the son who alerted Dutch police to the plight of his four brothers and sisters and their father, who were living in isolation at a remote house while apparently waiting 'for the end of times'\n\n'It was enough for you to come near the farm and he sent you away. He followed everything with binoculars,' one local told Aftonbladet.\n\nLocal media said Josef B had a small workshop in Meppel and came to the Netherlands in 2010, the same year the family were locked up at the remote house, though the Austrian authorities have yet to confirm this.\n\nIt comes after the first pictures emerged of Jan Zon van Dorsten, 25, who saved the family after he walked to a nearby bar and asked for help.\n\nPolice say Jan had been living in a 'small, enclosed space' for the last nine years until he appeared at the bar.\n\nThe mystery is deepened further by the fact that Jan, the eldest son, had access to social media and had been active on Facebook since June this year.\n\nPosts on his public profile show he used the platform for several years until 2010, when he posted saying that he had moved to Ruinerwold - the village where the house is located.\n\nThe profile then goes silent until June this year, when it suddenly reactivated with a post announcing that Jan was working as an online store manager at Creconat, located in Meppel - a village around four miles from Ruinerwold.\n\nJan raised the alarm after walking from the house to a local bar where he ordered five beers and told the bartender that he couldn't go home\n\n'Creativity for everyone!' the post says.\n\nCreconat is associated with a timber company called Native Creative Economy, also based in Meppel, which is owned by Josef B, according to De Telegraaf.\n\nPolice raided the premises on Monday, a neighbour said. It is not clear what, if anything, was found.\n\nJan spent his time on social media posting pictures of nature and promoting causes, such as climate strikes.\n\nPolice continued working at the property Wednesday, as they try to unravel the mystery of how the family came to be there, and whether they were being kept against their will\n\nOn Saturday he uploaded three photos of landmarks around Ruinerwold that were taken in the dark. It is thought these were taken while he was walking to the bar.\n\nIt is reported he went to the bar three times before the barman - Chris Westerbeek - called police, describing Jan as dishevelled, confused and needing help.\n\nNone of Jan's family were registered on government databases, police have confirmed - perhaps indicating how they managed to go undetected for years.\n\nPolice say they are puzzled by the case - a mystery that is deepened by the fact that Jan had access to social media and had been posting since June this year until the time he was rescued\n\nJan was active on Facebook until 2010, when it is thought his family moved to the house, before his profile went silent - only to activate again in June this year\n\nPolice were still present at the house on Wednesday, three days after the initial raid took place\n\nThe house is located in Ruinerwold, around 60 miles north of Amsterdam, and it is thought the family moved there in 2010\n\nLocal media reported Josef B was born in Vienna. The Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs could only confirm that Josef has requested not to be contacted by the embassy, and has refused their help.\n\nA man named online as Tonnie, who had the workshop next to Josef's, told Dutch news site ED that he was a highly skilled woodworker and often made parts for pleasure yachts. 'A real craftsman,' he said.\n\nAlida ten Oever, who owned the house and rented it to Josef, said that he always paid rent on time and that she never saw signs of other people living at the property.\n\nNeighbours told RTV Drenthe that Josef was a private man who never allowed visitors inside the house.\n\nThe house itself was set back 200 yards from the nearest road, and another 100 yards from the nearest building.\n\nPictures show it was surrounded by trees, blocking off the view, and also had a perimeter fence.\n\nVegetables were being grown in plots surrounding the property, while a goat was also kept there.\n\nLocals who visited said there was a security camera trained on the yard, and there were suspicions within the village that Josef was growing cannabis.\n\nPolice raided the property along with a workshop belonging to Josef B in the nearby village of Meppel, where Jan listed himself as working\n\nBar owner, Chris Westerbeek, recalled the 25-year-old man came in numerous times over a number of days and looked 'confused'\n\nPolice spokesman Ramona Venema confirmed the family was found at the remote house\n\nHowever, as news of the family spread, there was widespread shock and disbelief.\n\n'We are quite perplexed about it all,' landlady Oever said.\n\nRuinerwold mayor Roger de Groot told a press conference that neither he nor the police had ever seen anything like it.\n\nSpeaking about the inside of the house, he added: 'The police found a number of rooms with makeshift furnishings where the family lived a withdrawn existence. That is where the six were found.'\n\nHe denied that the family had been living in a basement.\n\nA statement from local police said Josef B was refusing to cooperate with the investigation but was detained and being interrogated.\n\n'We understand that everyone still has many questions,' a police spokesman said. 'We do too. That is why we want to do our research thoroughly and carefully.\n\n'This means that we may not be able to answer everything immediately. Simply because sometimes we don't have answers yet. Or we cannot share them.\n\n'We have called in a Large Scale Investigation Team (TGO). Investigators are probing possible criminal offenses under the leadership of the Public Prosecution Service.'", "description": "Josesef B, known as 'Josef the Austrian' will appear in court on Thursday,\u00a0as it emerged the family speak in a 'fantasy language' after spending nine years in isolation in Ruinerwold.", "authors": ["Sophie Law", "Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/16/19794650-0-image-a-111_1571239723400.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
