Should you buy one?\n\nThat is what reviewers have asked since the company announced the Apple (ticker: AAPL) iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max\u2014which start at $699, $999, and $1,099, respectively\u2014earlier this month. They are now available both for order and in stores.\n\nBefore the phones were unveiled, expectations seemed muted, with outsiders guessing that next year\u2019s phones, and the expectation of more widely available 5G networking, would be more compelling. But with Apple lowering the price of its \u201cstarter\u201d phone this year, improved battery, and some catch-up camera technology, many reviewers have found themselves charmed.\n\nThe company\u2019s focus may largely be on services, but it still needs people to buy phones to access them. Reviewers seem pretty happy with the latest crop, and some analysts believe consumers will happily snap them up.\n\nHere\u2019s a roundup of reviewer opinion from around the internet:\n\n\u2022 The phones\u2019 performance is impressive, Lauren Goode wrote for Wired: \u201cThe phones are fast. Downloading apps is fast. Switching between apps is fast. Processing and editing photos is fast. Apple Pay is faster on this phone; Face ID feels slightly faster. FaceID supports more face angles too, which means that, as I write this, I can lean over the iPhone 11 resting on my coffee table and it will unlock. AirDrop feels like a dream.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Some thoughts on design from Nilay Patel at The Verge: \u201cI got a lot of questions about the new matte finish, and I think it\u2019s quite nice, especially in Apple\u2019s new midnight green color (which is a grayish, military green that people seem especially drawn to). The back didn\u2019t really pick up any fingerprints, but it does seem a tiny bit more slippery than the glossy back of the previous phones and the iPhone 11. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big deal; most people will stick this thing in a case. A lot of people also asked me if the matte finish scratches as easily as Google\u2019s Pixel 3, and so far, the answer seems to be no.\u201d\n\n\u201cApart from these new colors, the iPhone 11\u2019s design hasn\u2019t changed much since last year,\u201d Chris Velazco wrote at Engadget. \u201cThe phone\u2019s frame is still made of aluminum instead of stainless steel, and the 11 remains slightly chunkier than either of the new Pros. And if you were hoping that the iPhone 11 would get some sort of screen upgrade: Sorry, not this time. Apple confirmed that the 11 uses the same Liquid Retina (aka LCD) display found in last year\u2019s XR.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The draw, for many buyers, may be the cameras. The iPhone 11 has two rear cameras\u2014Ultra Wide and Wide\u2014while the Pro and Pro Max add a telephoto. At TechCrunch, Matthew Panzarino wrote extensively on the phones\u2019 new photography features, including Apple\u2019s version of a low-light \u201cNight Mode.\u201d\n\n\u201ciPhone 11\u2019s Night Mode is great,\u201d Panzarino wrote. \u201cIt works, it compares extremely well to other low-light cameras and the exposure and color rendition is best in class, period. If that does it for you, you can stop right here.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand: \u201cReality check: Apple is hardly the first phone maker to offer three rear cameras,\u201d Ed Baig wrote for USA Today. \u201cAmong others, Samsung\u2019s rival flagship, the S10, also has rear ultrawide, wide and telephoto lenses. Plus, the slightly elevated bump housing the three cameras on the 11 Pros, may turn off some people. For what it\u2019s worth, my teenage daughter thought it was \u2018ugly,\u2019 though in the same breath she said she wanted me to buy her the new phone. What the design of the three cameras oddly reminded me of were the heads on a Norelco electric razor.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The \u201cbase\u201d model seems like the best one for most people, Engadget\u2019s Chris Velazco wrote.\n\n\u201cThe iPhone 11 takes almost everything that makes the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max special and squeezes it down into a package that\u2019s $50 less than last year\u2019s cheap model,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not worth buying if you have an iPhone XR or XS, but for everyone else, it\u2019s the easiest way to get a taste of modern flagship iPhone performance without dropping $1,000.\u201d\n\nMark Spoonauer at Tom\u2019s Guide felt the same way. \u201cQuick quiz: Name a new Apple product that got significantly better from one generation to the next and also cheaper,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a short list, but that aptly sums up the iPhone 11, which boasts much better cameras than last year\u2019s iPhone XR. And at $699, it\u2019s $50 less than its predecessor.\u201d\n\n\u2022 At CNET, Scott Stein preferred the midrange model.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gravitated to the 5.8-inch size of the iPhone XS, because its compactness and camera quality made it an easy tool,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat makes me love the iPhone 11 Pro this year even more, because the battery life has gotten good enough to last almost a whole day, more or less. The way I\u2019m glued to my phone, I gave the 11 Pro a bit of a top-off before I commuted home to be safe. It\u2019s super expensive, but the 11 Pro feels like the perfected iteration of the iPhone X formula.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Along those lines, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Joanna Stern called extended battery life the most important development the phones offer.\n\n\u201cIn the scheme of iPhone upgrade history, the new iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max sure seem boring,\u201d she wrote. \u201c Same designs...but new colors! Cameras...but three of them! Glass...but stronger?! After a week of testing, I can tell you that\u2019s mostly just smoke-and-mirrors marketing, except for one thing many of us have wanted all along: phones that are a bit heavier and thicker\u2014but work when we damn well need them to. Yes, longer battery life.\u201d\n\nEmail David Marino-Nachison at david.marino-nachison@barrons.com.
