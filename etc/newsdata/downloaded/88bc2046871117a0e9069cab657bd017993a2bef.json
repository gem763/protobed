Petersen is accused of arranging for dozens of pregnant women from the Marshall Islands to come to the U.S. to give their children up for adoption. Utah also has charged him with 11 felony counts, including human smuggling, sale of a child and communications fraud. (Maricopa County Sheriff's Office via AP)\n\nHe offered each of the expecting mothers $10,000 to put their newborns up for adoption, siphoning off money for housing and health care after arranging for them to travel more than 5,000 miles from the Marshall Islands to the United States, prosecutors said.\n\nThen, after falsifying their residency records to enroll them in state health care coverage, Paul Petersen commanded a $35,000 fee from parents eager to adopt, according to the authorities.\n\nThat\u2019s how the alleged adoption fraud scheme operated for 3 1/2 years, until Petersen, the elected assessor of Maricopa County, Arizona, and a private adoption lawyer, was indicted this week in three states.\n\nPetersen, 44, of Mesa, Arizona, is accused of placing at least 29 babies from the South Pacific island nation with adoptive families and bilking taxpayers of $814,000 in health care costs, according to a 32-count indictment in Arizona. The felony charges against him include fraud, forgery and theft.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfair to the adoptive parents, and it\u2019s also unfair to every hard-working Arizona taxpayer,\u201d Mark Brnovich, Arizona\u2019s attorney general, said during a news conference Wednesday.\n\nA 1983 compact prohibits citizens of the Marshall Islands from traveling to the United States for the purposes of adoption. The compact allows Marshallese citizens to freely enter and work in the United States.\n\nJust before Petersen\u2019s arrest Tuesday, eight pregnant Marshallese women were discovered at a home in Mesa by law enforcement officers carrying out a search warrant, the authorities said.\n\nPetersen\u2019s lawyer, Matthew Long, disputed the felony charges during a court hearing Tuesday in Maricopa County, where a judge set Petersen\u2019s cash bond at $500,000.\n\n\u201cThe allegations here, we look forward to challenging,\u201d said Long, who objected to the bond amount and argued that Petersen was not a flight risk.\n\nLong did not immediately respond to a request for further comment Wednesday.\n\nPetersen was also indicted by federal prosecutors in Arkansas and state prosecutors in Utah. The authorities said Petersen had help from Lynwood Jennet, who was charged as a co-defendant and is Marshallese. It was not immediately clear if Jennet had a lawyer.\n\nBrnovich assured parents of the babies who were adopted that they would not lose their children and said that their biological mothers were not facing charges.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has adopted a kid has nothing to worry about,\u201d Brnovich said. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to go back and redo adoptions or any of that kind of stuff. Our focus is on these specific individuals, who have allegedly abused the system and ripped off Arizona taxpayers.\u201d\n\nBrnovich said that most of the babies were placed with adoptive families in other states and that their birth mothers returned to the Marshall Islands in some cases.\n\nAccording to his biography on the Maricopa County website, Petersen was first elected assessor in 2014 and was reelected in 2016, when he received more than 1 million votes. The assessor is responsible for land valuations and property tax policy. Phoenix is part of Maricopa County, which is Arizona\u2019s most populous county.\n\nPetersen\u2019s adoption website lists the average cost for an adoption as $30,000 to $40,000, which \u201ccovers the birth mother\u2019s monthly expenses, prenatal and delivery medical expenses and assistants and office expenses.\u201d\n\nCol. Frank Milstead, director of the Arizona Department of Public Safety, said during Wednesday\u2019s news conference that a state trooper was first alerted about the scheme by a friend who had questioned the legitimacy of Petersen\u2019s adoption service.\n\nPetersen is expected to enter a plea on his next court date, which is scheduled for Oct. 15.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "He offered each of the expecting mothers $10,000 to put their newborns up for adoption, siphoning off money for housing and health care after arranging for them to travel more than 5,000 miles from the Marshall Islands to the United States, prosecutors said.Then, after falsifying their residency records", "authors": ["Neil Vigdor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BMCLAexpKWL6CHr5_DanTQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/d9593bd0-eb6c-11e9-afdb-b31386732272", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
