Sisters Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian are teaming up with the beauty mogul to launch The Diamond Collection, a set of three perfumes, on November 8th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Creating the KKW Fragrance Diamonds Collection with Kim and Kourtney was so inspiring. I wanted to create a fragrance that feels feminine, sexy and strong when I wear it.,\" Khloe wrote on Instagram. \"It\u2019s such a dreamy scent with a mix of sweet florals and musk that can be worn from day to night. I\u2019ve been wearing this non-stop and love it more and more every day.\"\n\nKhloe's perfume is in a pink diamond bottle and described as a floral bouquet. Notes include Italian bergamot, something called Sparkling Pink Puff Violet Accord, tuberose, jasmine, sweet lilac blossom, and musks and woods.\n\n\n\nKourtney's perfume is the yellow diamond, which is meant to smell like daylight and is a sparkling oriental gourmand. Notes include golden currant berries, jasmine, magnolia, iris, vanilla, patchouli, and musk.\n\n\n\n\"Working with my sisters for this collection was nostalgic. Fragrance is so personal, so being able to create my own scent from start to finish was an exciting experience,\" Kourtney wrote on Instagram. \"I wanted to create a vibrant one that matches my classic, playful vibe. The combination of Golden Berries, Jasmine and Vanilla is refreshing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third perfume is a clear and classic white diamond by Kim Kardashian West. Though she now has over a dozen fragrances in her KKW Fragrance line, this new one is a bouquet of white florals. Notes include tropical floral leaves, sugar coated ginger, wild armoise morocco organic, ylang ylang oil cosmors orpur, orange flower absolute orpur, exotic sampaguita blossom, coconut milk cream, and musk.\n\n\u201cThis collection is really special because it\u2019s the first fragrance collaboration I\u2019ve done with Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 for my KKW Fragrance line. Each of the fragrances really capture us individually,\" says Kardashian West. My scent is fresh and floral but becomes warmer and more sensual as I wear it throughout the day. I can\u2019t wait for you to experience the collection and find your favorite.\u201d\n\nKardashian West previously collaborate with sister Kylie Jenner on a set of three fragrances, which are now available in all Ulta stores.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe KKW Fragrance Diamond Collection by Kourtney x Kim x Khlo\u00e9 will be available at KKWFragrance.com on Friday, November 8th, 2019 at 12:00PM PST. Each 30ml bottle is $40 and the bundle of all three is $110.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The Diamond Collection features three new perfumes inspired by each sister.", "authors": ["Jenna Rosenstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/53hybt3w2j9wGbQTi8T7Aw--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_391/7a603b0dbd9ba7aac73dad6ca7910d4a", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
