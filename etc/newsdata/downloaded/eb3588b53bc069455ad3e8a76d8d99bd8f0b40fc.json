Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) raise their hands to answer a question on Thursday, Sept. 12, during a Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by ABC at Texas Southern University in Houston. | David J. Phillip/AP Photo\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nSPLIT SCREEN \u2026 ALL EYES turned to Houston on Thursday night as the top 10 Democratic presidential candidates faced off for the first time all on one stage. A FEW THOUGHTS: Health care once again dominated the evening with Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders duking it out over the issue for the first 30 minutes of the debate. Biden was on the defensive pretty much all night with nearly every other candidate taking swings at him. Juli\u00e1n Castro landed the most aggressive verbal punch, calling out the former VP\u2019s age and asking if Biden was \u201cforgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d\n\nAWKWARD LINE OF THE NIGHT: BIDEN talking about kids needing to listen to a RECORD PLAYER while discussing segregation \u2026\n\n\u2026 WHAT HE SAID: \u201cSocial workers help parents deal with how to raise their children. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help, they don\u2019t know what to play the radio, make sure the television -- excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the -- make sure that kids hear words, a kid coming from a very poor school -- a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time we get there.\u201d\n\nCLEANUP ON AISLE BIDEN! \u2026 BIDEN and his team were forced to do cleanup on another issue -- his comments about how \u201cnobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime.\u201d Post-debate, he told reporters he was talking about \u201cnonviolent drug offenses.\u201d\n\nONE WORD NOT UTTERED LAST NIGHT: Impeach.\n\nSOMEONE SMARTER THAN US has to explain to us the coalition on Capitol Hill that would vote for a law to take away AR-15s from people and give people $1,000 each month.\n\nWHAT THEY\u2019RE SAYING \u2026\n\n-- JOHN HARRIS: \u201cBiden\u2019s previous uneven performances didn\u2019t dislodge him atop the race, and so caution is justified in predicting bleeding wounds from this one. Even so, discursive answers on substantive issues like deportation of undocumented immigrants and Afghanistan, an oddly dated reference to a \u2018record player,\u2019 disrespectful digs and patronizing swipes from rivals, all raise the question: Can he withstand four more months of this before actual Democratic voting begins?\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- WAPO\u2019S DAN BALZ in Houston: \u201cBiden delivers the debate performance he needed, despite occasional missteps\u201d: \u201cWith all the leading Democratic candidates on the same stage for the first time this year, former vice president Joe Biden on Thursday delivered the kind of performance his supporters have been waiting for \u2014 combative when needed and in the thick of the action throughout.\n\n\u201cBiden did not dominate from start to finish and did not make it through the evening mistake free. But on balance this was the kind of evening he needed, after two previous debates in which he drew mixed to negative reviews, and after uneven performances at Democratic gatherings and along the campaign trail.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- L.A. TIMES\u2019 MARK BARABAK\u2019S SEVEN TAKEAWAYS: \u201cJoe Biden goes the distance \u2026 Warren faces incoming \u2026 O\u2019Rourke shakes off the shackles \u2026 Juli\u00e1n Castro swings below the belt \u2026 Democrats love Obama \u2026 Kamala Harris makes nice \u2026 Ten is still a crowd.\u201d LAT\n\n-- RYAN LIZZA: \u201c[Biden\u2019s] strategy, which is often mocked, of hugging Obama like a life preserver through the rapids of the primary has carried Biden far. And Thursday night suggested that trying to break loose Biden\u2019s grip from his Obama raft is still surprisingly difficult for his opponents.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- NYT: \u201cMarathon Democratic Debate Includes No Questions About Women\u2019s Issues,\u201d by Nick Corsaniti and Matt Stevens\n\nAS WE PREVIEWED Thursday at the top of Playbook, President DONALD TRUMP began speaking at exactly 8:01 p.m., and stayed on stage until after 9 p.m. -- counterprogramming to the debate.\n\nSOME CHOICE LINES that highlight how he might campaign in 2020: \u201cWe\u2019re fighting two battles: the Democrats and the media.\u201d \u2026 Democrats want to \u201ctake your money\u201d and \u201churt your family.\u201d\n\nYOUR MOMENT OF ZEN ... THE PRESIDENT took aim at the Green New Deal, saying \"no more cows, no more planes, I guess no more people, right?\"\n\n\"BECAUSE KEVIN is just like a cow, he's just smaller,\" Trump said. \"I had to pick somebody for that one, Kevin, and I just looked at that beautiful, political face of yours.\"\n\n-- BEHIND THE SCENES \u2026 BEFORE TRUMP spoke at the Baltimore retreat, he appeared at a private \u201calter call\u201d with House Republicans. An alter call is when House Republican leaders -- in this case Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise -- ask for donations during a rollicking meeting.\n\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS raised $7 million for the NRCC -- $1 million each from Scalise and McCarthy. TRUMP was in a good mood in the meeting, and praised Rep. DEVIN NUNES (R-Calif.) for being brave, and one of the president\u2019s earliest supporters.\n\nTHE ENTIRE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE signed a NASCAR helmet thanking TRUMP for helping win the two North Carolina congressional seats. Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) provided the helmet.\n\nGood Friday morning.

It is an unusual crisis stemming in part from the state\u2019s economic success and one where the lack of political will, rather than a lack of public resources, is often the primary obstacle to resolving it.\u201d WaPo\n\nNANCY COOK: \u201cIvanka tells donors she got her moral compass from her dad\u201d: \u201cAt a mid-August fundraiser in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Ivanka Trump was asked to name the personality traits she inherited most from her parents. Without much of a pause, Trump told the crowd of roughly 120 high-end donors that her mother gave her an example of how to be a powerful, successful woman.\n\n\u201cAnd her father? He passed onto her his moral compass, she said, according to two event attendees. The exchange was part of a broader conversation about Ivanka Trump\u2019s life in Washington and the White House during a swanky retreat organized by Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in the Wyoming mountains. Her appearance signaled an informal effort by the Trump campaign, family and top aides to woo donors this election cycle by sharing intimate, colorful details about this atypical White House.\n\n\u201cThe goal: lean on the celebrity status of the sprawling Trump clan, and even well-known aides, to make donors feel like they are part of the show \u2014 and deeply committed to winning the president four more seasons.\u201d POLITICO\n\nA message from Business Roundtable: American workers and families rely on trade with Canada and Mexico.

Congressional Democrats have also been investigating military stays at the property, but have yet to receive any information from the Pentagon.\n\n\u201cThe figure does not indicate how many of the stays have occurred since Trump became president. But the Air Force has significantly ramped up its overnight stops in Scotland under Trump after signing a contract with the Prestwick Airport \u2014 situated 20-plus miles from Turnberry \u2014 in the waning months of the Obama administration. Since 2015, the service has lodged crews in the area 659 times, meaning up to 6 percent of those stays were at Turnberry.\u201d POLITICO\n\nTHE COUNTER-INVESTIGATION -- \u201cJustice Department authorized prosecutors to charge Andrew McCabe,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Matt Zapotosky and Spencer Hsu: \u201cJustice Department prosecutors were authorized to seek an indictment alleging former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe lied to investigators, and on Thursday he was told one of his last bids to persuade them not to had failed, people familiar with the matter said.\n\n\u201cBut with the green light to proceed \u2014 and a grand jury summoned back after a months-long hiatus to consider the case \u2014 the day came and went with no public charges being filed. Grand jurors were sent home and McCabe remained in limbo, waiting to see whether the investigation that began more than a year ago would end with a fight to stay out of prison.\u201d WaPo\n\nBUT, BUT, BUT \u2026 NYT\u2019S ADAM GOLDMAN: \u201cHints of the case\u2019s weakness have since emerged. The investigation was referred about 18 months ago, which is an unusually long stretch for an inquiry with a limited set of facts and witnesses. It dragged on for so long that the first grand jury examining the evidence expired before apparently being called back this week.\n\n\u201cOne prosecutor assigned to the case recently left, an unusual step so close to an indictment. Another departed for a private law firm and has expressed reservations about the merits of the case.\n\n\u201cAnd one key witness testified that Mr. McCabe had no motive to lie because he was authorized as the F.B.I.\u2019s deputy director to speak to the media, so he would not have had to hide any discussions with reporters. Another important witness testified he could not immediately remember how the leak unfolded. Both would have been crucial to any prosecution.\u201d NYT\n\nO RLY -- \u201cTed Cruz eyes the White House: \u2018I hope to run again,\u2019\u201d by The Christian Science Monitor\u2019s Linda Feldmann: \u201cSpeaking to The Monitor after a breakfast session with reporters, the Texas Republican didn\u2019t hesitate when asked if he would take another crack at the White House.\n\n\u201c\u2018Look, I hope to run again,\u201d said Senator Cruz \u2026 \u2018We came very, very close in 2016.
