REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa\u2019s rand was steady in early trade on Monday, as investors waited for the U.S.-China talks due to start this week to see if the world\u2019s two top economies can find a path to a trade deal.\n\nAt 0625 GMT, the rand traded at 15.0500 per dollar, not far off its close of 15.0700 on Friday.\n\n\u201cMarkets remain firmly at the mercy of headlines. From the U.S., we have talks of an impeachment; in the UK, Brexit and its effects remain; and global attention is now on the scheduled resumption of trade talks between China and the U.S.,\u201d Nedbank analysts wrote in a note.\n\nLocally, the woeful state of state-owned enterprises and the government\u2019s continued bailout of these firms remain a drain on the economy, they said.\n\n\u201cWith these factors weighing on the local unit, it has thus far, unsurprisingly, failed to make any headway on a move sub-15.0000,\u201d they added.\n\nSouth Africa relies on exports to China and the United States for a bulk of its revenue, and the deepening spat between the two sides risks denting the country\u2019s already dim economic prospects.\n\nThe United States and China have slapped tariffs on each other\u2019s goods as part of a long-running dispute over Beijing\u2019s trading practices, which Washington says are unfair. The next round of trade negotiations are slated to be held in Washington on Oct. 10-11.\n\nIn fixed income, the yield on the benchmark government due in 2026 was up by 0.5 basis point to 8.19%.", "description": "South Africa's rand was steady in early trade on Monday, as investors waited for the U.S.-China talks due to start this week to see if the world's two top economies can find a path to a trade deal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437981966&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960C5-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
