(An Instagram spokesperson says the company has no plans to add its own on-platform payment options.) At any rate, Wiley argues that the only weird thing about these arrangements should be the name Instagram chose for the feature. \u201cIn calling it Close Friends, Instagram is making it creepier than it has to be,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not really Close Friends; it\u2019s gated content. Influencers have just figured out a way to hack [the feature] into something that fits in with their business model,\u201d she adds.\n\nClose Friends was introduced in November 2018 as a way to help users deal with context collapse\u2014the uncomfortable reality that not everything a person might post will be received the same way by everyone who could stumble across it. (And, more uncomfortable, for Instagram: that this might cause people to post less.) Employers and admissions officers typically lack a reverence for thirst traps and deep-fried memes; influencers with the incentive to appeal to a broad audience can\u2019t drop the mask or post in-jokes to their actual friends. Inspired by the years-long rise of secret, secondary \u201cfinsta\u201d accounts, Close Friends was also a transparent move to recapture the interest of young people who consider Snapchat the best safe space for content they don\u2019t want parents and teachers and lurking weirdos to see.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t really supposed to be about money for anyone other than Instagram, but as with Facebook\u2019s before it, Instagram\u2019s choice to officially brand the word friend is not a neutral one. Designating a type of relationship as a feature of an app is going to have strange consequences.\n\nThe perfect case study of the implications of Close Friends subscriptions is Caroline Calloway. Calloway, the influencer famous for extremely long captions about her improbably charmed and romantic life (and more recently for a prolonged and confusing debate about whether she\u2019s a scammer or just a mess), started offering her 797,000 followers the option of exclusive paid access to her Close Friends list in August.\n\nFollowers who paid $2 a month would become Close Friends, in the Instagram definition of the word, and those who paid $100 a month would become Closest Friends\u2014meaning they would also get a one-hour monthly Skype call. (Calloway offered only 20 spots in the latter group because \u201cthere are only so many hours in a month.\u201d) She currently has 342 Close Friends, and her Patreon page promises that when she hits 400 she\u2019ll do an exclusive \u201corchid hair tutorial.\u201d\n\nAs with everything Calloway has done in the past several months, the move was controversial. \u201cEvery time I think that Caroline Calloway can\u2019t top her current shenanigans, she just does,\u201d one follower tweeted. \u201cShe\u2019s selling friendship on Patreon. Friendship!\u201d Two days into the Close Friends experiment, Calloway posted a photo of her manager and his assistant manually adding people to her Close Friends list for her, which seemed to undercut the friendship proposition even further. (Calloway did not respond to an interview request.)\n\nMina Hughes, a 22-year-old student in Texas, told me she subscribed out of irrepressible curiosity. Given the extreme intimacy of all that Calloway had already shared, she asked, \u201cHow could I not want to see what she deems private enough to put behind a paywall?\u201d But Calloway hasn\u2019t posted much since the first week of the fee, according to Hughes, and most of the content showed up again on her public story later.", "description": "Influencer culture has normalized charging money for all kinds of intimacy.", "authors": ["Kaitlyn Tiffany"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_685445998-1/facebook.jpg?1568734951", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
