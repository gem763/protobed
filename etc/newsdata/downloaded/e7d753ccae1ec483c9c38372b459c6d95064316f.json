It was just perfect and he handled it well. He should come out running.\u201d\n\nCode of Honor and Vino Rosso are expected to provide a tough challenge while Elate, trained by Bill Mott and ridden by Jose Ortiz will try to become just the second mare, after Zenyatta in 2009, to win the Classic.\n\nThe races on Friday and Saturday will mark the 10th time that Santa Anita has hosted the Breeders\u2019 Cup.\n\nBut the picturesque track nestled in the San Gabriel mountains northeast of Los Angeles has come under intense scrutiny this year with equine deaths reaching 36 through Sunday.\n\nAn outcry was unleashed as 30 horses had to be euthanized from December 26 to June, sparking calls from animal rights activists to halt racing at Santa Anita or even ban the sport in California.\n\nCalifornia law enforcement authorities have instituted an investigation as have state racing officials and federal legislation to introduce a national commissioning body has been introduced.\n\nSix more have since died, including two just this weekend during the track\u2019s Autumn meeting.\n\nBaffert insisted that he didn\u2019t believe Santa Anita posed any special danger to his runners and that new regulations governing race-day medications and increased pre-race veterinary scrutiny had improved safety.\n\n\u201cI think it was like a wake-up moment for racing. We need to do a better job,\u201d Baffert said. \u201cAnd I think trainers, everybody involved, I think we\u2019re being more conscientious than before and I think it\u2019s going to be a great Breeders\u2019 Cup.\u201d\n\nUS trainer Chad Brown, who saddles 9-5 early favorite Bricks and Mortar in the $4 million Turf over 1 1/2 miles, said he had tried to monitor the situation from his training base on the East Coast.\n\n\u201cI did have a lot of questions from clients throughout the summer and right into the fall here about our plans, individual horses, about my opinion on it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut ultimately we feel confident in Santa Anita\u2019s management, that the track will be safe.\n\n\u201cI support everything they\u2019ve been doing to try to improve the situation.\u201d\n\n\u2013 O\u2019Brien seeks seventh Turf triumph \u2013\n\nIn the Turf, Brown will be up against Irish trainer Aidan O\u2019Brien, who sends Epsom Derby-winner Anthony Van Dyck with Ryan Moore in the irons out in search of O\u2019Brien\u2019s seventh Turf win.\n\nVan Dyck will break from the fifth post in the 12-horse field while Bricks and Mortar \u2014 winner of his past six starts dating to 2018 drew the ninth post and with Irad Ortiz aboard will be testing the 1 1/2-mile distance for the first time.\n\nThere was a blow for O\u2019Brien Monday when he announced that Magical, the four-year-old daughter of Galileo who has amassed more than $4 million in earnings, wouldn\u2019t make the trip after spiking a slight fever and would be retired.\n\nO\u2019Brien still boasts more than a dozen runners, including Prix du Moulin winner Circus Maximus who was made the early 3-1 favorite for the Mile on the turf track.\n\nThe $2 million Filly & Mare Turf will see Sistercharlie, trained by Brown, try to become the first back-to-back winner of the 1 1/4-mile race.", "description": "Arcadia (United States) (AFP) \u2013 The Bob Baffert-trained McKinzie was installed Monday as the early 3-1 favorite for the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/924132_aidan-brien-trained-anthony-van-dyck-winning-epsom-derby-is-favorites-2019-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
