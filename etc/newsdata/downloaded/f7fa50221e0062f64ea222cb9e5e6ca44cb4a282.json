However, being bitten by a tick does not necessarily mean a person will fall ill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tick-borne encephalitis virus is already present in mainland Europe and parts of Asia.\n\nIt is thought infected ticks may have arrived in the UK through migratory birds.\n\nDr Nick Phin of PHE said: \u2018These are early research findings and indicate the need for further work. However, the risk to the general public is currently assessed to be very low.\u2019\n\nMost people who catch the encephalitis virus will have no or only mild flu-like symptoms.\n\nBut it can affect the brain and central nervous system and can sometimes be fatal.\n\nDr Phin said: \u2018We are reminding people to be \u201ctick aware\u201d and take tick precautions, particularly when visiting or working in areas with long grass such as woodlands, moorlands and parks.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
