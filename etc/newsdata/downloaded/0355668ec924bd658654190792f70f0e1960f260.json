He called a reporter for The New York Times an \u201cObama toady.\u201d\n\nA Washington Post piece about Trump\u2019s \u201clost summer\u201d and the dragged-out flap over the president\u2019s claim about Alabama\u2019s vulnerability to the hurricane were the two stories that seem to leave him particularly irked.\n\nNews organizations targeted by Trump either struck back or ignored him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reluctant to declare one moment or another a turning point on this hairpin road we\u2019ve traveled these past few years,\u201d said Nancy Gibbs, faculty director of Harvard University\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. \u201cBut when we are arguing about the weather, we are in a new place.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet of the flaming CNN logo came after the Alabama story. He tweeted over the weekend that he would like to stop talking about the story, but the media kept bringing it up. \u201cThey always have to have the last word,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump and his aides offered new evidence to buttress his claim that early forecasts said there was a chance Dorian could brush Alabama. He called in Fox\u2019s Roberts last Thursday to the Oval Office to show similar material. That was also the same day Fox anchor Shepard Smith delivered a blistering fact check on some of the president\u2019s claims. Fox would not comment on published reports that the president also wanted to vent to Roberts about Smith.\n\nThe Post story, published a week ago, suggested Trump had wasted time over the summer with self-inflicted controversies and squandered opportunities. In response, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham and a press aide, Hogan Gidley, wrote an op-ed titled \u201cThe Washington Post\u2019s lost summer\u201d that was published in the Washington Examiner on Thursday. They said the newspaper had ignored many of Trump\u2019s \u201cwell-documented victories.\u201d\n\nFor example, they wrote that the Post did not write about Trump\u2019s efforts to tighten the southern border and ease the elimination of student debt for wounded veterans. But the Post later provided links to its coverage of those stories, leading the website Mediaite to write, \u201cWhite House press secretaries publish op-ed claiming Washington Post didn\u2019t cover stories the paper actually did cover.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Trump tweeted that the reporters who wrote the Post piece, Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker, should not be allowed on the White House grounds because their reporting \u201cis so DISGUSTING & FAKE.\u201d\n\nThe Post\u2019s executive editor, Martin Baron, said the paper stood behind its reporters.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s statement fits into a pattern of seeking to denigrate and intimidate the press,\u201d Baron said. \u201cIt\u2019s unwarranted and dangerous, and represents a threat to a free press in this country.\u201d\n\nHarvard\u2019s Gibbs said it\u2019s hard not to conclude that the White House wants to destroy faith in truth and facts, and replace it with the theology of loyalty, where a politician\u2019s supporters are expected to believe whatever he says, however outlandish.\n\n\u201cThat is why we can\u2019t separate the crises of trust and truth,\u201d she said. \u201cThe less we trust institutions, whether government agencies or the media or business or civil society groups, the more likely we are to believe junk news and partisan garbage. And that\u2019s a danger to all of us.\u201d\n\nTrump supporters cheered a president who is taking on the press directly. \u201cThe media has never suffered such body blows before from a Republican, and it is truly driving them insane,\u201d wrote William Marshall in a column on the conservative website Townhall.com.\n\nTrump kept up attacks on CNN, a favorite target, through the weekend and into Monday. He said CNN\u2019s international division \u201cspews bad information and fake news all over the globe.\u201d He suggested the company is losing money, which CNN disputed. And he cheered a report that activist hedge fund manager Elliott Management is investing in AT&T;, expressing the wish it would put a stop to \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nTrump also complained that NBC News, in a documentary and a town hall meeting about prison reform that aired Sunday night on MSNBC, gave no credit to him and other Republicans for their role in passing legislation that reduces some sentences for people serving time in federal prisons. The Lester Holt-narrated documentary aired a 15-second clip of Trump\u2019s bill-signing ceremony, and there was a short discussion of the legislation at the town hall meeting.\n\nTrump\u2019s name wasn\u2019t mentioned in the town hall discussion, however.\n\nLegend was a participant in the town hall meeting, leading Trump to bash him and Teigen on Monday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press White House correspondent Zeke Miller contributed to his report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Even for a president who has made attacks on the media routine, the past few days have seemed turbo-charged.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Bauder"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/trump_06216_c0-213-5088-3179_s1770x1032.jpg?d28462d74232844549408e71e93f46d82537392a", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
