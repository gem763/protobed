She is pictured with her mother Ruth Moss who blames NHS Tayside for her death\n\nSheriff Hughes said: 'This is a very tragic situation, and a complex one.'\n\nOutside court, Mrs Moss said she was pleased the investigation had finally reached court.\n\nShe said: 'I have a real mix of emotions today, but it's a relief that the inquiry is finally starting.'\n\nShe last year said NHS Tayside's Child and Adolescent Health Services had not provided enough support to Sophie following her initial two suicide attempts.\n\nMrs Moss said she believed NHS Tayside's risk assessments were 'hugely inadequate'.\n\nThe probe, at Dundee Sheriff Court, is taking place after the Lord Advocate, Scotland's most senior law officer, ruled that it should be held as Sophie's death gives rise to 'serious public concern'.\n\nA spokesman for NHS Tayside said: 'As this is a legal matter we are unable to comment. Every suicide is a tragedy and our thoughts remain with the family.'\n\nFor confidential support 24/7 in the UK, you can call the Samaritans on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org", "description": "Sophie Parkinson (pictured), 13, was found dead at her family home in Liff, near Dundee, in March 2014.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/15/19994628-0-image-a-105_1571668276056.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
