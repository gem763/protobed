We work towards this mission in a number of ways, including providing a free tool that can help build stronger relationships between communities and their local law enforcement agencies,\" they said in a statement to The Hill.\n\n\"All content submitted to our app is reviewed to ensure that it adheres to our community guidelines, including our policies against racial profiling and prohibiting hate speech or other forms of prejudice before it goes live on the platform.\"\n\nThis report was updated at 3:05 pm", "description": "A group of\u00a0more than 30 civil rights groups on Tuesday signed an open letter calling o", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/amazon_ring_09102019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
