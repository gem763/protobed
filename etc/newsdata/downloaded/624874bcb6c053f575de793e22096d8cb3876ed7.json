REUTERS/Susana Vera\n\nPro-establishment and democratic lawmakers shouted at each other before the beginning of the session, underscoring the tension and divisions in the Asian financial hub after four months of often violent pro-democracy protests.\n\nSome lawmakers wore black masks as they sat in the chamber, with others carried placards reading: \u201cPolice brutality still exists, how can we have a meeting?\u201d\n\nThe wearing of face masks was banned under colonial-era emergency powers invoked by embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam a week ago.\n\nThe protests have plunged the city into its worst crisis since it returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, posing the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nWhat began as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has evolved into a pro-democracy movement fanned by fears that China is stifling Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms guaranteed under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula introduced with the 1997 handover.\n\nChina denies the accusations and says foreign countries, including Britain and the United States, are fomenting unrest.\n\nMetro operator MTR Corp, whose network carries about 5 million passengers a day, said all lines would shut at 10 p.m. (1400 GMT) on Friday, more than 2 hours earlier than usual so more repairs could be carried out after protesters torched or trashed stations across the city.\n\nMany stores and businesses have had to shut early due to metro closures, putting another burden on the city\u2019s faltering economy as it faces its first recession in a decade.\n\nProtesters have targeted the MTR because it has been blamed for closing stations at the government\u2019s behest to contain demonstrations.\n\nThe normally efficient system shut down completely last Friday following arson attacks and has operated only partially since then.\n\nLam introduced the emergency laws, including the ban on face masks last week in an effort to quell unrest. But the ban sparked some of the worst violence since protests started.\n\nThe government said it would not bring in any other emergency measures.\n\nQUIET THURSDAY\n\nShopping malls and other facilities closed early on Thursday but few demonstrators took to the streets, with only about 60 activists gathering outside one police station.\n\nBut several demonstrations are planned across the city on Friday and through the weekend, when more people have been coming out to vent their opposition over the weeks.\n\nSeveral major conferences and other events have been called off because of the protests with the latest being an annual swimming race in the city\u2019s famed harbor.\n\nProperty developer New World Development Company Limited (0017.HK) said it was cancelling the Oct. 27 competition because of the \u201csocial situation\u201d.\n\nThe protest movement still appears to have a broad base of support despite the violence and vandalism carried out by small groups of front-line protesters.\n\nLam is due to deliver the city\u2019s annual policy address on Oct. 16 which traditionally contains sweeteners and support for business and investment.\n\nShe has said that due to the unrest her address would not be as \u201celaborate\u201d or \u201ccomprehensive\u201d as normal.\n\nPro-democracy lawmakers on Friday reiterated calls for authorities to address the protesters\u2019 \u201cfive demands\u201d which include universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into their complaints of excessive force by the police.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nBernard Chan, the convener of Hong Kong\u2019s executive council - the lead advisory body to the chief executive - wrote in an opinion piece in the South China Morning Post on Friday that Lam\u2019s policy address would include responses to address the discontent.\n\nChan said the Independent Police Complaints Council should be allowed to do its own investigation into the controversy over areas such as police procedures and held out the option of an independent inquiry later.", "description": "Hong Kong's metro operator opened all stations on Friday for the first time in a week ahead of another round of anti-government protests, while the city's legislature began its first session since protesters stormed the building in July.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439511494&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A04S", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
