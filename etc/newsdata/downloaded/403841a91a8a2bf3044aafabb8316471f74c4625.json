Consider that multiplied across 145,000 letters, the number forwarded since the charity began in 2011.\n\nIn 2009, Mulligan, who lives in Folsom, Calif., was writing a novel in the form of a series of letters (later published as \u201cFrom Across the Room\u201d), when she received a diagnosis of breast cancer. She was flooded with more than 200 cards and letters of support, mostly from people she didn\u2019t know but whom she suspects were friends of her colleagues and church friends. \u201cIt was very strange, and I was sensitive to it because of my research with letters. I realized how special they were.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Mulligan was receiving the letters, she was undergoing six weeks of daily radiation treatment and seeing the same women in the prep room. \u201cSome were there by themselves without family or friends,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all think everyone has a support system, but that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nOnce Mulligan emerged from treatment \u2014 at age 51, she is now 10 years cancer-free \u2014 she mulled over how to help others. She was thinking about the various campaigns to support U.S. military troops and had a lightbulb moment \u2014 she could organize letters for breast cancer warriors. \u201cLetters are tangible; you can reread them,\u201d Mulligan says. \u201cYou get that feeling of not being alone, of being cared for.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how it works. People send handwritten cards or letters to Girls Love Mail, where Mulligan and volunteers screen the letters. They then send them on to 165 cancer centers across the country, for distribution by nurse navigators. Centers that deal with metastatic cancers and higher stages will screen the letters a second time to ensure they\u2019re appropriate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKathleen Ellis of Austin underwent breast cancer surgery on May 6. In June, her oncologist handed her one of the Girls Love Mail envelopes. \u201cI opened it and it said, \u2018To the awesome woman holding this card.\u2019 I just burst into tears. It was a such a sweet thing from a stranger.\u201d\n\nEllis, 71, had memories of her mother, who died in 1996, writing letters at a card table nightly. \u201cIt\u2019s become rare. We don\u2019t often get personal mail from people anymore. And it takes more time than hitting \u2018send\u2019 on an email.\u201d The labor felt personal to Ellis. \u201cEven if the woman who sent this wrote a bunch of letters with exactly the same language, I got it.\u201d\n\nMany studies show a connection between social support and health outcomes. \u201cIf people have emotionally supportive relationships or are embedded in a network of people who are supportive, that has been linked to better mental health and longevity,\u201d says Bert N. Uchino, who is chair of the psychology department at the University of Utah and has conducted research on the subject.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDefinitely what I see is that these letters give these patients a network of support,\u201d says Stephanie Brown, a breast cancer nurse navigator at Sutter Health in Sacramento. \u201cAnd something that is tangible to them that they will keep and cherish throughout their entire cancer journey.\u201d She knows the letters are effective because patients often come back and write letters for others.\n\nBrown believes the best letters are \u201cones that say, \u2018I know you\u2019re going through a hard situation, but stay strong and positive and know that people are thinking about you, and they care about how you\u2019re doing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nUchino points out some seemingly supportive messages aren\u2019t appropriate. \u201cSaying, \u2018I know you\u2019ll be fine\u2019 can be unhelpful and minimizes the problem,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to make sure the support is responsive to that person\u2019s needs; otherwise, it\u2019s even more of a stressor.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMulligan is sensitive to ensuring the letters are helpful. With her team of 15 volunteers, she says, \u201cwe read every letter, and we post guidelines on our website. We have figured out that some wording doesn\u2019t work, so we don\u2019t mention death, and we leave out religion. We make sure the letters sound encouraging, which I know is subjective, without belittling the experience.\u201d\n\nThe first requirement is that the letters be handwritten. \u201cPart of what makes the letters special is that handwriting is unique. Even people crossing things out and making mistakes, that gives it personality. We\u2019ve had people use handmade papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 paper, make drawings and add stickers or crocheted elements. One woman even made a needlepoint card.\u201d\n\nMulligan\u2019s other tips for writing letters include:\n\nAD\n\n\u2022Start with your favorite quote and use that as a launchpad.\n\nAD\n\n\u2022Think of a loved one while you\u2019re writing.\n\n\u2022Write from the heart; you can\u2019t go wrong.\n\nShe notes that while many of the letters are written by breast cancer survivors, most are not. Surprisingly, \u201cone of the biggest demographics we get are high school and college-age writers. They think it\u2019s very retro to pick up a pen.\u201d An all-girls high school in Covington, La., wrote 792 letters in one day. A women\u2019s prison in Ohio sends a giant box of letters every month. Letters arrive from all over the world \u2014 in Tagalog, French, German and Chinese (foreign-language letters are forwarded unscreened). She says the organization needs more letters in Spanish: \u201cWe get very few. And it\u2019s wonderful to get a letter in your native language.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome letters deserve a wider audience, Mulligan believes. In 2017, she published 100 such letters she had set aside over the years, including one from a woman involved in the first tamoxifen study in 1970s. The collection is called \u201cDear Friend: Letters of Encouragement, Humor, and Love for Women with Breast Cancer.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe woman who kept her sole letter by her bedside wrote a thank-you note to its author. Girls Love Mail letters are signed by first name and last initial only, but because the author had an unusual first name, Mulligan was able to forward the regards. \u201cI love that example, because we forget the impact of our kindness. It took 10 minutes to write the letter, and it meant so much to someone else.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in writing a handwritten letter, visit girlslovemail.com.\n\nMore from Lifestyle:\n\nAD", "description": "Girls Love Mail sends missives to patients across the country.", "authors": ["Erika Mailman"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DBT-PUZqX38Lw3qyuU_J7UjJY8s=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YI5T33HXJ4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
