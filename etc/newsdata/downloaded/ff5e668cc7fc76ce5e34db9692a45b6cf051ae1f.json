For example, white Americans, on average, have higher average incomes and are more likely to have college degrees than Americans who identify with nonwhite races. These factors, along with other social factors, contribute to the homeownership gap.\n\nRead more: The racial wealth gap in the US keeps getting bigger \u2014 and it could cost the economy as much as $1.5 trillion by 2028\n\nThe gap is largest in New York and smallest in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe gap between the population of white Americans and the amount of homes owned by white Americans is the widest in the New York metro area.
