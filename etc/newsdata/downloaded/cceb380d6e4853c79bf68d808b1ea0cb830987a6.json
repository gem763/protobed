On Oct. 6, those buses were taken off the roads to make way for the changeover to light rail, leaving just two local bus routes and three night express routes using the dedicated lanes.\n\nThat means while cars and trucks clog the traffic lanes on Scott and Albert, the bus lanes beside them go virtually unused. During the busiest hour on weekday morning, there are only six buses \u2014 one every five minutes \u2014 using one of the lanes.\n\nIn an email, the city said it's too late in the season to convert the bus lanes into traffic lanes, so it won't be making any changes this year.\n\n\"As we are approaching the end of the construction season, the City of Ottawa is holding off on any major reinstatement or reconfiguration work until 2020,\" it said.\n\nThe bus lanes on Scott Street are no longer used by most downtown bus routes, but Coun. Jeff Leiper says keeping in place them will come in handy when replacement buses are needed during LRT delays. 0:37\n\nConstruction postponed\n\nConverting the eastbound bus lane between Bayview Road and Empress Avenue was on the city's list of projects to be done the week of Oct. 7, but was postponed.\n\nOther planned changes, such as removing bus lanes on Nicholas Street, went ahead.\n\nThe councillor for the area, Jeff Leiper, said it might be in the city's best interest to keep the bus-only lanes for use by replacement buses when the LRT breaks down.\n\n\"Having the dedicated bus lanes there is probably prudent through the winter while we're sorting those really significant LRT issues out,\" Leiper said.\n\nThe city has confirmed the bus lanes on Scott and Albert streets are still reserved for buses, and remains off limits to motorists.\n\nAn OC Transpo bus streaks down Albert Street on Feb. 22, 2019. (Trevor Pritchard/CBC)\n\nStreet overhaul coming next year\n\nWhen construction does begin, the city plans to overhaul the entire two-kilometre stretch of Scott and Albert streets, a plan unveiled in December 2017.\n\nThe reconfigured stretch will run from approximately the City Centre building westward to Tunney's Pasture, and cyclists, pedestrians and drivers will see major changes.\n\nAccording to the city's drawings, the number of lanes would be reduced from four to three, with two lanes for westbound traffic but only one heading east toward downtown. The westbound bus lane would be opened to traffic.\n\nA multi-use pathway that currently exists on the north side of Scott and Albert streets will remain, but will eventually be closed to eastbound cyclists. Those cyclists will instead use a raised \"cycle track\" on the opposite side of the street.\n\nEastbound bus stops will also be placed on platforms that jut out from the curb, allowing cyclists to pass behind them.\n\nThis work was slated to begin this year, but was delayed by the Confederation Line's late opening.", "description": "Bus-only lanes on Scott and Albert streets are staying put until next year, despite the fact that there are very few buses now using them.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5335657.1572025235!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/scott-street-at-preston-oct-25-19.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
