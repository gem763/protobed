The device is powered by Apple's A12X Bionic processor, which means that it's great for things like basic video editing and other professional applications, like graphic design. That makes it great for mobile gaming too. The iPad Pro should last most of the day, thanks to its 10-hour battery life.\n\nThe 11-inch iPad Pro is available in a few different storage amounts, including 64GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB models. All models seem to have gotten a discount of some kind, but the 64GB with its $125 discount is the best deal on offer right now.
