So that's what I'm really looking for, is where the downward shifts are and where the upward revisions are,\" Calvasina said last month. \"And I can't really think of any major problems coming around the bend on financials and I think the valuations are very cheap. So that's a sector I have some comfort on.\"\n\nWall Street's big banks have fared well thus far in 2019 on the heels of lackluster performance in 2018.

I've started to get interested in the valuations, but I'll tell you what's bothering me is that the margin expectations are still really high,\" she added. \"It's one of the highest sectors in terms of the percent of companies where expansion is anticipated and the degree of expansion that is anticipated.\"\n\nCalvasina also discusses:", "description": "RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina shared her thoughts with CNBC Pro on where investors should look for outperformance in 2019.", "authors": ["Thomas Franck"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105679435-3ED2-REQ-ProTalksCalvasina-011519.jpg?v=1547567508"}
