An undergraduate nurse or midwife will take home $58,837 in their first year in Queensland, while they earn $57,616 in NSW.\n\nSenior registered nurses with at least eight years experience in Queensland take home the most, $92,63, followed by NSW on $89,800, Victoria $82,256, and $88,050 in South Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNSW Nurses and Midwives Association secretary Brett Holmes said the shortage extended into all areas that employ nurses.\n\nMr Holmes said aged care providers particularly were struggling to compete for qualified nurses.\n\nLa Trobe University associate professor Michelle Newton said nursing graduates had no trouble gaining work. \u201cNursing is almost a guaranteed job,\u201d Professor Newton said.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the [final] year the vast majority of those students have picked up work. La Trobe graduate data shows 96.6 per cent of students are employed, which compares to 95.6 per cent across the sector in Victoria,\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Victoria we have a system where nurses in their first year out of university are matched through a centralised system... We certainly know that the majority get placed.\u201d\n\nShe said the Victorian health department has forecast shortages for some time mainly due to an ageing population.\n\n\u201cThat data shows the nursing and midwifery shortage is real.\"", "description": "Employers are battling over nursing staff because Australia's aging population is sending demand higher, and even final-year students are guaranteed a job.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3702%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_368%2C$y_72/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/04c65463a906546a26efbc38af93ac25d88b29bd", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
