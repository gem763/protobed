Investors are bracing for a selloff on Tuesday, when early backers of the faux meat maker will finally be allowed to cash out.\n\nThe maker of meatless beef and sausages said third-quarter sales rose 250% to $92 million, outpacing analysts\u2019 average estimate. The company now sees full-year revenue of $265 million to $275 million, compared with a July projection that it would surpass $240 million.\n\nKey Insights\n\nBeyond Meat\u2019s shares dropped for a second straight time after reporting earnings even amid increasingly optimistic projections. In July, the stock fell after the company announced a secondary offering. Now, with early backers expected to cash in on the company\u2019s surge since its IPO, market factors are once again outweighing performance.Regardless of stock market activity, the sales outlook is rosy. Beyond Meat, based in El Segundo, California, has been steadily adding restaurant partners. The latest, announced earlier Monday, is Denny\u2019s. Dunkin\u2019 restaurants are also taking the company\u2019s plant-based breakfast sausage across the U.S. Retail, restaurant and foodservice channels have all seen increased volumes, the company said in the release.Investors are eager to hear about more tie-ups, especially with big restaurant chains. In September, Beyond Meat announced a test in Canada in McDonald\u2019s. On Monday\u2019s call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown said he is \u201cvery optimistic about the long-term relationship\u201d with McDonald\u2019s and has \u201cevery expectation\u201d that the test will lead to more work together. But ultimately, it will be up to the restaurant chain to make that announcement, he said.\n\nMarket Reaction\n\nBeyond Meat shares fell as much as 14% in after-hours trading on Monday before paring much of the loss. The share decline of about 8.7% at 5:53 p.m. in New York may just be a blip on the radar for the company, whose stock has soared more than 320% since its IPO.\n\n(Updates share trading and last bullet under key insights.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Deena Shanker in New York at dshanker@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Jonathan Roeder, Lisa Wolfson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Beyond Meat Inc. fell in late trading despite an increased sales forecast and its first quarterly profit.
