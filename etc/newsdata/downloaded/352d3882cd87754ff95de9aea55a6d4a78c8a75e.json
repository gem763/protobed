This process has been identified as one of the hindrances to the effective delivery of quality and real-time services to the clients.\n\n\u201cThus, a decision was taken to decentralise it (Paymaster services) to labour centres,\u201d said Ramokoena.\n\n\u201cAs part of this roll out, we are busy training officials who will assume responsibilities associated with Paymaster. Training has already been given to labour centres at Phuthaditjhaba, Harri\u00adsmith and Bethlehem.\n\n\u201cWelkom, Kroonstad, Bloemfontein and Botshabelo will also receive training in the coming weeks,\u201d says Dr Nandipha Kahla, acting chief director for the Free State.\n\nZastron and Petrusburg\u2019s labour centres will not be converted due to lower volumes of applications received, says the department.", "description": "The long wait of beneficiaries due to the processing and paying out of funds from the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) in the Free State is a thing of the past.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/10227041841/picture", "published_at": "2018-01-24"}
