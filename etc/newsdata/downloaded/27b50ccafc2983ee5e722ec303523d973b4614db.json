The post further suggests that this could result in new kinds of decentralized financial (DeFi) services, including banking, lending and peer-to-peer transactions that require no intermediaries.\n\nThis June, BRD partnered with blockchain payments and infrastructure firm Wyre to allow its United States-based customers to purchase cryptocurrencies using bank transfers. The new service is reportedly supported by over 1,700 U.S. banks, and ostensibly allows for purchases to register within five minutes.\n\nTaking proactive investment approach\n\nXpring has made an array of notable investments in recent months, including a partnership with major cryptocurrency payment processor BitPay to let businesses accept XRP for payments via BitPay\u2019s cross-border payments platform. As part of the cooperation, BitPay is also integrating its BitPay Wallet with Xpring\u2019s developer platform.\n\nIn late September, Xpring onboarded Logos Network, a distributed ledger-based payment platform that focuses on speed and scalability. Logos will be exploring a DeFi system that is set to leverage XRP at its core.\n\nIn August, Xpring announced a 1 billion XRP (roughly $265 million) grant to web monetization platform Coil. The latter is reportedly supposed to utilize the funds to build an ecosystem of creators, developers, companies and nonprofits that use XRP through the Web Monetization open standard.", "description": "Ripple\u2019s investment arm Xpring has invested in cryptocurrency wallet BRD to enable users to hold, purchase, sell and spend XRP tokens through the wallet", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy80ZmExZTdiMjhlZTZjYjQ4ZTdjYWQ3YjczNTk3ZGE1ZC5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
