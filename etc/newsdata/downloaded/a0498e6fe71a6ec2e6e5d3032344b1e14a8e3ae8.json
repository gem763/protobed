The surgeons worked on a fee-for-service model, which the study noted, is based on how hard and how long surgeons work in their treatment of patients. The standard fee approach didn\u2019t eliminate the gap, researchers noted.\n\nMen and women spent the same time working on common surgeries, but women had fewer chances to perform higher-paying surgeries. Male surgeons even earned more than their female counterparts in fields like gynecology, said the study, which did not specify rate prices.\n\n\u201cNone of the disparities are due to choices \u2014 women are not choosing to make less \u2014 and we hope that the findings highlight the need for a solution,\u201d said Dr. Fahima Dossa, co-lead author and general surgery resident at the Toronto-based St. Michael\u2019s Hospital.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Too many female doctors go part-time or stop working \u2014 why that\u2019s a big problem\n\nIn the U.S., studies suggest there\u2019s a persistent gender pay gap, although less than the survey of Canadian surgeons. Female surgeons said they expected to make $30,000 less a year than male surgeons, according to a survey of general surgical residents last year.\n\nFemale surgeons in the U.S. face a $1 million shortfall over their careers due to the gender pay gap.\n\nFemale residents said they expected a \u201cminimum\u201d starting salary of $249,502 a year versus $267,700 for male residents, a 7% pay gap. Female residents said they expected to earn $334,709 a year compared to $364,663 for men, a 8% pay gap.\n\nOverall, that amounts to close to a $1 million shortfall over a 30-year career, according to the findings from the Lundquist Institute, a Los Angeles, Calif.-based medical-research institute. \u201cIn 2017, women constituted just above 50% of medical school matriculants for the first time in history and currently hold about 40% of general surgery resident positions,\u201d the U.S.-based study found.\n\nThe median pay for physicians and surgeons last year was $208,000 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, female physicians make $275,311 a year or $108,000 less than their male counterparts, a gender pay gap of 28%, according to a separate survey released last year by Christopher Whaley, an assistant adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health and an associate policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, who authored the study for Doximity Inc., an online networking service for medical professionals.\n\nOverall, Canadian women make roughly 84 cents for every dollar a Canadian man makes, according to calculations that Glassdoor released earlier this year. In the U.S., women on the whole are paid approximately 81 cents on every dollar a man makes according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. (The Glassdoor study said American women make 79 cents on the dollar.)", "description": "Women also had fewer chances to perform higher-paying surgeries, according to a new Canadian study.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS440_female_ZG_20191001171238.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
