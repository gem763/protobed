Alex Ellinghausen\n\nWhen a not-for-profit no one's ever heard of goes up against the federal government, you'd never bet on the former. Still, isn't the Australian Communications Exchange making life difficult for comms minister Paul Fletcher.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, it had still not handed over the details of the deaf citizens the government pays it to provide telephone transcription services for under the National Relay Service. The government wants the details so it can in turn hand them over to the new provider, Concentrix, who won the three-year, $66 million government tender in July.\n\nACE reckons the Privacy Act prevents it from handing over customer details. It totally doesn't, the government insists.\n\nBut in any case, ACE says it doesn't even have the details. They're held by another company, AccessComm, which distributes the handsets through which ACE is able to provide transcription services. Under the terms of the 2013 contract, the then-Labor government wanted to assure a structural separation between the two entities who fulfilled the two functions of the National Relay Service.\n\nWe're not sure why anyone would have bothered. While the two companies are unambiguously legally separate, they're pretty linked. ACE's CEO Edward Gilliland is one of only two directors of AccessComm's parent company DFL Holdings. The other shares the same last name as him.", "description": "As of Tuesday afternoon, it had still not handed over the details of the deaf citizens the government pays it to provide telephone transcription services for under the National Relay Service.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2199%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_88/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2abd7f1ef51cf1226908291763b30d6016f4bbc0", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
