Joe\u2019s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019\n\nSince Biden and other Democrats have already decided the president is guilty, the White House sent a letter to House Democrats yesterday announcing they would not be participating in the Democrats\u2019 \u201cpartisan and unconstitutional inquiry.\u201d The letter explains:\n\n\"For example, you have denied the President the right to cross-examine witnesses, to call witnesses, to receive transcripts of testimony, to have access to evidence, to have counsel present, and many other basic rights guaranteed to tall Americans. You have conducted your proceedings in secret. You have violated civil liberties and the separation of powers by threatening Executive Branch officials, claiming that you will seek to punish those who exercise fundamental constitutional rights and prerogatives. All of this violates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent. Never before in our history has the House of Representatives\u2014under the control of either political party\u2014taken the American people down the dangerous path you seem determined to pursue.\u201d\n\nAs the LA Times reported on Monday, Speaker Pelosi bypassed a vote on a formal impeachment resolution that would have allowed the inquiry to be conducted in a traditional manner that has historically granted more fairness to Republicans and the president. For example, both Nixon and Clinton faced formal impeachment inquiries that allowed the minority party at the time to subpoena witnesses.\n\n\u201cIf similar language were included in a House impeachment inquiry resolution against President Trump \u2014 which is what Republicans are pushing for \u2014 it would theoretically enable GOP members to, say, subpoena testimony or information from former Vice President Joe Biden, or his son Hunter, or try to take the inquiry into an entirely different direction,\u201d the LA Times reported.\n\nAnd perhaps Biden is afraid of what direction the impeachment inquiry might take, and he would probably like to see Trump impeached sooner rather than later.\n\nFor Biden, there is no time for Republican subpoenas and cross-examining witnesses. As he told the crowd in New Hampshire, \u201cwe have to remember, impeachment isn\u2019t only about what the president has done. It\u2019s about the threat the president poses to the nation if allowed to remain in office.\u201d\n\nWatch Biden's full remarks here.", "description": "During a town hall in New Hampshire on Wednesday, Joe Biden said he now supports the impeachment of President Donald Trump..10/09/2019 18:01:47PM EST.", "authors": ["Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/50/7c3b6f0f-fe7f-4a93-8594-fda5d6486c9a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
