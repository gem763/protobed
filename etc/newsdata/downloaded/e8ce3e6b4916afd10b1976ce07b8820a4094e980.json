That\u2019s the game. That\u2019s why we\u2019re still a work in progress.\u201d\n\nEventually the multitude of factors that went into Washington\u2019s surprising 20-19 loss to California will likely be forgotten. The Huskies missed several red-zone opportunities, settling for field goals instead of touchdowns; had some untimely penalties; and put up little resistance to the Golden Bears\u2019 rushing attack in the third quarter.\n\nThis game will always be remembered for the severe weather early in the first quarter that caused a delay of 2 hours, 39 minutes. The game restarted at 10:30 p.m. and ended at 1:22 a.m. Sunday, shortly after Cal kicker Greg Thomas hit a 17-yard field goal for the winning points.\n\nPetersen said after the game and again on Monday the delay was not an excuse for Washington\u2019s lapses.\n\n\u201cI feel like the game picked up right back where it was,\u201d Washington safety Myles Bryant said after the game. \u201cBut we just needed to come out with a little bit more edge and energy, and I don\u2019t think we did a good job doing that.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t even a sure thing that the game would resume.\n\nPetersen said Monday there was constant communication with Cal\u2019s staff, including coach Justin Wilcox, about the options as lightning continued to flash within an 8-mile radius around the stadium and restart a 30-minute delay clock with every bolt. There appeared to be a consensus that if the game couldn\u2019t be restarted by 11 p.m., it would be called off and the teams would try to reschedule.\n\nBut the emphasis was on trying to play that night since the teams didn\u2019t have a mutual open date on the calendar.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to figure out if we were going to play is really what we were doing. We were looking at the weather and how long this was going to take,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cI think we were getting close, both sides were getting very close to calling it off if we couldn\u2019t get that thing started by about 10:30. Kept talking about 11 o\u2019clock, that\u2019s too late for the guys.\u201d\n\nWhen the game did restart, California\u2019s secondary caused problems for Washington quarterback Jacob Eason, who completed just 18 of 30 passes for 162 yards. And the Bears were especially troublesome in the red zone, where Washington was forced to kick three field goals after getting inside the Cal 20. In the opener against Eastern Washington, the Huskies had four TDs in six red-zone trips.\n\nPetersen knows the Huskies will need to be better at finishing drives with Hawaii visiting on Saturday. The Warriors already have wins over Arizona and Oregon State and are averaging 38 points and over 425 yards passing through two games.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see what they\u2019re doing out there and they\u2019re good at it,\u201d Petersen said. \u201c(Hawaii coach Nick Rolovich) has gotten back to his roots and they are good.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When Chris Petersen finally went back to watch what happened to No. 23 Washington after enduring a delay he'd never experienced as a coach and a game that ended at an hour never seen in school history, he didn't see glaring issues.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/california_washington_football_28280_c0-190-4542-2838_s1770x1032.jpg?8ae03f51e26191be413350dc5ce232e32d03352c", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
