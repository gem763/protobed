You're not alone. Each month, Netflix quietly removes hundreds of hours of content across all genres and categories.\n\nJust last week, the company deleted over 200 movies and TV shows. We now have an explanation as to why this keeps happening, direct from the horse's mouth. (Not, not Bojack Horseman. A PR person.)\n\nNetflix Is Nuking Over 200 Shows This Week It's that time of the month again when Netflix deletes a bunch of third-party content off its service. Normally, we'd advise you to watch these movies and TV shows while you still have the chance - but this week, that's mathematically impossible. Over the next three days, Netflix will remove over 200 titles totalling thousands of hours of entertainment. Here's the full list.

(Which suggests they receive this question quite a bit.)\n\nHere's the full explanation as it appears on Netflix's blog post:\n\nNetflix licenses TV shows and movies from studios and content providers around the world, and those licenses can expire if we don't renew them. Though we strive to keep the content you want to see, we acquire licensing rights for TV shows and movies for a certain period of time - not indefinitely - so some titles do leave Netflix. If a TV show or movie you love is leaving, it indicates that our licensing agreement with the content provider is about to end. Whenever a TV show or movie is expiring, we evaluate whether or not to renew it using the same criteria we apply to potential new content. We consider factors like: Are the rights to renew the licensing to stream still available?\n\nWhat is the popularity and cost of a particular title?\n\nAre there other seasonal or localized factors? If a TV show or movie is renewed, it remains on our service for you to enjoy. If a TV show or movie is not renewed, we'll give you a heads up on our website that it's about to expire.\n\nSo there you have it. If a title leaves Netflix, it's because it wasn't popular enough, was too costly to renew or got snapped up by another streaming service prior to the expiration date.\n\nThe good news is that this only applies to third-party content (i.e. - the movies and TV shows that were produced by other studios.)\n\nYour favourite Netflix Originals, like Black Mirror, House Of Cards, Stranger Things and BoJack Horseman, won't be going anywhere. This includes any shows that have completed their runs or were axed by Netflix - the old episodes will continue to be stored indefinitely.\n\nAustralian Netflix Keeps Removing Movies (Find Out Which Ones Here) The sad truth of the matter is that Netflix giveth and thus Netflix must taketh away - but at least there's a way to find out just what it is that's disappearing.
