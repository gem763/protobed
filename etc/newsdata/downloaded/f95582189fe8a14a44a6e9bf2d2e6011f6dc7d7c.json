The company said the certificate allows it to expand its delivery service in campus settings such as hospitals and universities, but added that residential deliveries are years away.\n\nThe certification allows UPS pilots to fly drones beyond their line of sight and opens the door for the delivery company to expand Flight Forward. The fledgling unit is immediately doubling the number of drone flights it does for its flagship customer, Raleigh, North Carolina\u2019s WakeMed Health & Hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll easily get to 20-plus flights per day, per drone,\u201d said Scott Price, UPS\u2019 chief strategy and transformation officer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a business, it\u2019s not a prototype or a test,\u201d Price said of Flight Forward, which ferries blood and tissue samples to WakeMed\u2019s central laboratory from points around its main hospital campus.\n\nUPS said its latest certification clears the way for Flight Forward to add other campus delivery projects without seeking government approvals for each one.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of campuses in the United States,\u201d said Price, who added that UPS is eyeing drone deliveries on hospital, corporate and university campuses as it builds Flight Forward.\n\nEarlier this year, Alphabet\u2019s Wing, the sister unit of search engine Google, was the first company to get U.S. air carrier certification for a single-pilot drone operation. It is testing home deliveries in a rural area around Blacksburg, Virginia.\n\nAmazon, known for its splashy drone delivery tests, also has won experimental certifications to test its drones.\n\nThe FAA is writing rules for drone operations, including guidelines for sharing airspace with passenger planes and flying over populated areas.\n\nResidential deliveries, Price said, are \u201cyears out.\u201d", "description": "United Parcel Service Inc on Tuesday said it won the U.S. government's first full approval to operate a drone airline, which gave it a lead in the nascent U.S. drone delivery business over rivals Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc .", "authors": ["Lisa Baertlein", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435923275&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9030E-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
