Buying activity rose another 0.6 per cent in September to 512,000 units (seasonally adjusted and annualized) \u2014 the highest level in 21 months and 6.6 per cent above the 10-year average, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association.\n\nMore evidence of a red-hot real estate market came on Wednesday when the Toronto Real Estate Board reported that condo sales in the third quarter rose 11.1 per cent compared to the same period last year.\n\n\u201cCondominium apartments are obviously a popular choice amongst first-time home-buyers,\u201d said Jason Mercer, TREB\u2019s chief market analyst. \u201cMoreover, it is also important to remember that condominium apartments owned by investors represent a huge component of the GTA rental stock and certainly account for most additions to the rental stock, on net, over the past decade.\u201d\n\nNewcomers to Canada are vital to the health of our national real estate market Phil Soper, Royal LePage president and CEO\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada senior economist Robert Hogue notes that conditions are ripe for another rally in housing prices after a pause earlier in the year.\n\n\u201cDemand-supply conditions have tightened up, and are gradually heating up prices. Low interest rates, strong labour markets and rapid population growth will continue to fuel demand in the period ahead,\u201d said Hogue in a report. \u201cPromises made during the federal election campaign could heat things up further.\u201d\n\nAll the major political parties remain open to some levels of immigration, and the perception appears to hold among newcomers, according to the LePage survey.\n\nThe poll of 1,500 people who arrived in Canada within the last 10 years found more than half of newcomers \u2014 54 per cent \u2014 chose Canada because it\u2019s a good place to live and work while three quarters said they didn\u2019t consider moving to the U.S., with 31 per cent citing a better reception for immigrants in Canada and 26 per cent saying it was safer.\n\nAlmost half \u2014 46 per cent \u2014 chose Ontario, helping power the province\u2019s property market especially in Toronto and Ottawa, according to the survey. Nearly a third \u2014 32 per cent \u2014 of newcomers to those cities buy houses, which is the national average, the poll showed. That compares with 68 per cent home ownership for all Canadians, according to Statistics Canada.\n\nQuebec drew 19 per cent of newcomers because of good schools, quality of life and relative affordability, which helps counter an aging population and those who leave the province, according to Royal LePage\u2019s local vice president and general manager, Dominic St. Pierre.\n\n\u201cIn addition to enriching the province\u2019s social fabric, newcomers provide a population boost that supports both a healthy economy and vibrant real estate market,\u201d St. Pierre said.\n\nB.C. came third with about 13 per cent of newcomers to Canada, according to Statistics Canada and holds the survey\u2019s highest amount \u2014 89 per cent \u2014 of those who arrive with savings to buy a house, perhaps reflecting the strong influx of wealthy Asians in the market.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: cmcclelland@postmedia.com", "description": "Immigrants buy 21 per cent of houses and may purchase 680,000 homes during the next five years, a Royal LePage poll shows", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/for-sale.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
