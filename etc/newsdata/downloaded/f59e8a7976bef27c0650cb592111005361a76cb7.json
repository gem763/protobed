If they had been closer to the mainstream you might have imagined we are giving them some sort of currency.\u2019\n\nWith child neo-Nazi band Prussian Blue (Picture: BBC)\n\nHowever, 2019\u2019s political landscape is vastly different, with Louis admitting: \u2018In this day and age, when you have members of the alt right who, in some cases, have crypto-fascist views or coded racist views and some not-so-coded racist views, and there is a trickle up or trickle down to the White House, suddenly you are in a different space.\n\n\u2018You are in danger of lending credence to or popularising hate and, as a result, I have been very wary of doing that.\u2019\n\nThe journalist, whose new book Gotta Get Theroux This was released in September, has recently opened up about his infamous 2001 Savile documentary, calling the filming process: \u2018as \u2018the strangest and most upsetting thing I\u2019ve ever been involved in.\u2019\n\nThe experience rocked Louis, who was shocked by Savile\u2019s tactics to avoid being labelled a paedophile.\n\n\u2018The hallmark of his offending was he was weirdly brazen in his ability to address it and take the position that is completely bizarre,\u2019 he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He had an ability not to be nobbled by it. When he was confronted about his offending, people did come to confront him and he had the ability to brazen it out.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
