That\u2019s because this letter wasn\u2019t fully written by lawyers.\n\nIt was crafted, in large part, by President Donald Trump himself.\n\nAccording to two people familiar with the process, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone had multiple meetings with President Trump in the days leading up to the issuance of the letter. During those meetings with Cipollone, the president would get especially animated when names such as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chair of the House Intelligence Committee leading the probe into the whistleblower complaint, came up. The sources said that Trump enthusiastically suggested adding various jabs at Democratic lawmakers and would request that their \u201cunfair\u201d treatment of him be incorporated into the letter.\n\nThe result was what Bob Bauer, who served as President Obama\u2019s White House counsel, called a \u201cremarkable\u201d and \u201cextraordinarily political document.\u201d\n\nTrump had also privately consulted on the letter with Rudy Giuliani, his notably pugnacious personal lawyer who is at the center of the Ukraine and Biden-related scandal engulfing the administration. Trump talked to Giuliani about how he and the White House should proceed in fighting back and challenging the legitimacy of the impeachment probe, one of the sources noted. Reached for comment on Thursday evening, the former New York mayor and Trump confidant repeatedly declined to confirm or deny this.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump took the unprecedented step of providing the public transparency by declassifying and releasing the record of his call with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. The record clearly established that the call was completely appropriate and that there is no basis for your inquiry,\u201d the Cipollone-signed, grievance-riddled letter reads. \u201cThe fact that there was nothing wrong with the call was also powerfully confirmed by Chairman Schiff\u2019s decision to create a false version of the call and read it to the American people at a congressional hearing, without disclosing that he was simply making it all up.\u201d\n\nA White House spokesperson did not provide comment for this story.\n\nThat Trump has leaned so heavily on his own intuition in crafting the legal response to his impeachment crisis has come as no surprise to those who know him. The president has\u2014however misguidedly\u2014long thought of himself as more keen and cunning than his advisers. And from his rise in real estate and reality TV through his ascendance to the presidency he has shuddered at those individuals who have sought to curb his impulses, even when they\u2019ve argued that those impulses bend the limits of the law.\n\nAnd yet, Trump\u2019s current go-with-your-gut approach stands out to many as a uniquely risky gamble. When his White House was navigating Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into 2016 election-meddling, the president early on leaned on two grey-bearded attorneys\u2014Ty Cobb and John Dowd\u2014and Don McGahn, a White House counsel with deep connections in Republican circles. Beyond that, he brought in Emmet Flood, a Washington, D.C., attorney well-steeped in special and independent counsel investigations, having lived through one himself.\n\nThose lawyers are now gone. And Trump seems inclined to do little to buff up the ranks. The one person that is reportedly being added to his legal team is a former member of Congress, Trey Gowdy, who, the president says, can\u2019t even start until January because of ethics laws.\n\nGowdy\u2019s apparent restriction is particularly problematic given the fact that Democratic lawmakers wish to hold an impeachment vote before the year\u2019s end.\n\nBecause the president has chosen to surround himself predominantly with loyalists, his administration has often been beset by fissures between the more trusted advisers and the institutionalists.\n\nIn mid-2017, for example, Giuliani showed up at the entrance of the Department of Justice unannounced, and called Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2019s office to insist on a meeting, The Washington Post reported and a source familiar with the incident confirmed. The president\u2019s personal lawyer was there to talk about one of his clients, Iranian-Turkish gold trader Reza Zarrab. But Rosentein declined to take the meeting.\n\nTrump himself grew so distrustful and unfriendly toward McGahn by the end of McGahn\u2019s tenure that he\u2019d even ask those close to him, \u201cis [Don] wearing a wire?\u201d according to a source with knowledge of the comment. ( Axios was first to report this suspicion earlier this year.) Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova, two informal legal advisers to the president who also sought to aid Giuliani on some of the Ukraine effort, are Trump superfans. And when news leaked out that Gowdy was being hired, they went on record to bash the decision.\n\nVeterans of past White House counsel\u2019s offices say they aren\u2019t surprised by the current landscape inside the White House. Few well-respected attorneys in the nation\u2019s capital have evinced any desire to work with the president. \u201cAt every level it is fraught with risk,\u201d said one. And the president appears to have no desire to consider legal counsel that diverts from his own primal political desires.\n\n\u201cThe lesson he learned from all that was fight, fight, fight,\u201d said a former senior official in the White House Counsel's Office. \u201cNot to follow the Ty Cobb and Emmet Flood approach and just get through it, which is what worked. That approach, the Cobb-Flood approach, is what White House counsels have done in the past, which is to try to accommodate, to get it behind you, to not give up the stuff you really want but the stuff you don\u2019t need. That\u2019s not the lesson he learned.\u201d\n\nPast administration staffers cautioned the damage being done is not just visible in the short term. By attaching his name to the eight-page letter, Cipollone will make it harder to craft future legal documents that will inevitably have to be issued in the course of the impeachment proceedings. \u201cThere is no reason that any of the other letters coming from him will be assumed to be written in good faith,\u201d said the former senior White House Counsel\u2019s Office official.\n\nAnd then there is the damage to the office itself. As Bauer noted, the White House counsel is not the president\u2019s lawyer but the lawyer for the presidency. Cipollone and his staff can and should reflect Trump\u2019s wishes but they must do so within clear professional and legal boundaries.\n\n\u201cThere are some very manageable lines and I don\u2019t think those lines have been at all observed here,\u201d said Bauer.\n\n\u201cPut it this way,\u201d he added, \u201cthe White House counsel never wants to come across as anywhere close to the way Donald Trump\u2019s doctor did in 2016.\u201d\n\n\u2014With additional reporting by Betsy Swan", "description": "President Donald Trump has slowly but surely bent the Office of the White House Counsel to his will.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "Sam Stein", "White House Reporter", "Politics Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570855037/191012-stein-swin-trump-lawyer-hero_jzveif", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
