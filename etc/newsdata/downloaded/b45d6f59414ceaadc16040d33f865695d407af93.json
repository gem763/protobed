The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is down 2.99% over this period, the index\u2019s worst two-day start to an October since 2008.\n\nBespoke Investment Group notes that the only other times we\u2019ve seen the benchmark index drop more than 2% to start the fourth quarter were in 1934, 1935, 2008, and 2009. Certainly not reassuring for students of stock market history, who will recall some of history\u2019s worst crashes (see October 1929, October 1987 and October 2008).\n\nScary stuff.\n\nBut this is also some pretty narrow quantitative history. Obviously every year, like this year, is different. And it\u2019s sort of random to think about one calendar month\u2019s worth of historical performance and believe we\u2019re fated to seeing history repeat regularly.\n\nOne chart I like to highlight occasionally is this one from JP Morgan Asset Management. It broadens the parameters a bit by doing away with the calendar months, and shows that in any given year, a big bumpy selloff should be expected.\n\nThat is, if history is to be used as a guide. And this chart also highlights that big selloffs can and often do happen during years that ultimately see stocks finish higher. It\u2019s the visual representation of saying that stocks usually go up.\n\nStock market (JPMorgan Asset Management) More\n\n\u201cDespite average intra-year drops of 13.9%, annual returns [were] positive in 29 of 39 years,\u201d JP Morgan analysts wrote.\n\nBasically, they\u2019re saying that big scary selloffs are not unusual. It\u2019s just part of the experience of being invested in stocks.\n\nGetting back to October, history isn\u2019t unambiguously gloomy. After Tuesday\u2019s 1.19% selloff in the S&P 500, Bespoke Investment Group published some encouraging research on what follows after volatile October 1s.\n\n\u201cSome of the worst starts to October have been followed by huge gains for the remainder of the month and year,\u201d Bespoke analysts wrote.\n\n\u201cThere have now been 14 [instances of the S&P falling by more than 1% on the first trading day of October ] since 1928. ...[T]he S&P has gained an average of 3.75% for the rest of October when it has started the month with a 1%+ decline. For the rest of the year, the S&P has been up 12 of 13 times after a 1% decline on the first trading day of October for an average gain of 7.22%. Bulls would certainly take a 1% decline today if it meant 7%+ gains through year-end compared to the average gain of 2.43% for all years.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s history for you.\n\nBy Sam Ro, managing editor.

After Canada, China, Mexico and the European Union slapped import duties from 10 to 25 percent on US whiskey and bourbon in 2018, exports dropped over 12 percent in the second quarter. Whiskey can be aged in used barrels and many of the barrels are sent overseas.
