Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen. \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) September 14, 2019\n\nWe call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran\u2019s attacks. The United States will work with our partners and allies to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) September 14, 2019\n\nIran? Aggression? What is he talking about? No one\u2019s worked harder for peace in the region \u2014 just ask former Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes, who helped create the media echo chamber that helped get the Iran deal through.\n\nThe Houthis are not the same as Iran and the Saudis are fighting a war against them in Yemen. This is an incredibly dumb, dishonest and dangerous thing to say. https://t.co/Ij5haLdzQr \u2014 Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) September 14, 2019\n\nRhodes must sit and search \u201cIran\u201d and \u201cTehran\u201d all day so he never misses a chance to defend Iran.\n\nBenny Rhodes: Defender of \u201cDeath to America.\u201d \u2014 Cynical Publius (@CynicalPublius) September 14, 2019\n\nIran deal flacks are gonna flack, flack, flack, flack, flack. https://t.co/50cvTWbwI8 \u2014 Mike (@Doranimated) September 14, 2019\n\nYou're a dangerously ignorant and willfully blind propagandist. https://t.co/un4CnGbHAj \u2014 Caroline Glick (@CarolineGlick) September 14, 2019\n\nThis was a useful talking point for you guys during Obama Term 2. It gave you a colorable excuse for inaction while the Iran-controlled Houthis rolled across Yemen. It's even less credible now. https://t.co/LFRH3ccWTY \u2014 Omri Ceren (@omriceren) September 14, 2019\n\nEvery time Ben Rhodes opens his mouth, I have to remind myself that yes, this man actually served as a Deputy NSA in the Obama White House. https://t.co/5Umi2BPHio \u2014 capitalist ghoul \ud83e\udd85 (@m0ve_im_gay) September 14, 2019\n\nMr. Rhodes claimed he had a Vulcan mind meld with the president as one of his most trusted aides, he represented the President. These delusional statements which ignore all reality were the views of the previous President of the United States. Think about it. https://t.co/pDJMYZ16MC \u2014 Ron M.

Go home Ben. https://t.co/qxTwkolwpA \u2014 Ari Krauss (@AriKrauss) September 14, 2019\n\nBasically for Ben to sound-off like this means @SecPompeo is exactly right https://t.co/pZXJ9B1tbp \u2014 James Jay Carafano (@JJCarafano) September 14, 2019\n\nEcho chambers gonna echo chamber https://t.co/opiVaSnxEZ \u2014 Benjamin Weingarten (@bhweingarten) September 14, 2019\n\nIran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah trains the Houthis. Iran backs the Houthis including by supplying them with advanced weaponry. You can keep pretending the Islamic Republic in Iran is not behind these destructive proxies. But facts are stubborn things. https://t.co/7XnUMtYmjU \u2014 Mark Dubowitz (@mdubowitz) September 14, 2019\n\nLadies, find yourself a man who loves you like Ben Rhodes loves the Iranian regime https://t.co/Z5c5w0aM3B \u2014 Noah Pollak (@NoahPollak) September 14, 2019\n\nI\u2019m speechless. How did you ever get a job as a national security advisor? https://t.co/HDD7WdVToi \u2014 Claire Voltaire (@Claire_Voltaire) September 14, 2019\n\nGP The Houthis are Iranian proxies. Do think Hamas isn\u2019t an Iranian cat\u2019s paw too? https://t.co/MG94QZZH1L \u2014 The Gormogons (@Gormogons) September 14, 2019\n\nObama's top aide still has to sell the lie that #Iran is moderate & the weapons, drones, missiles going to Houthis, Hizbullah, PMU in Iraq, Hamas, PIJ must have come from Amazon or Ali Express and not from Iran. https://t.co/JPgyJ6BChK \u2014 Lenny Ben-David (@lennybendavid) September 14, 2019\n\nShortly after the implementation of the JCPOA, a friend inside the USG conveyed concerns that Iran was sending some of the $150 billion to the Houthis in Yemen. https://t.co/qDN3BsIJjb \u2014 Jonathan Schanzer (@JSchanzer) September 14, 2019\n\nMore creative writing fiction from Ben Rhodes below.\n\nIran's chief proxy in Yemen is the terrorist Houthi movement. The Houthis are the mirror image of Hezbollah for Iran's regime but the Yemenite version. https://t.co/E9ToJUToQj \u2014 Benjamin Weinthal (@BenWeinthal) September 14, 2019\n\nThe Houthi spokesman last month openly swore allegiance to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei as a political and religious leader. Houthis coordinated with Iran in another recent attack reportedly launched from Iraq. There\u2019s proof they\u2019ve received material support form Iran. https://t.co/l7aScZKwYT \u2014 Amir Toumaj (@AmirToumaj) September 14, 2019\n\nYikes.
