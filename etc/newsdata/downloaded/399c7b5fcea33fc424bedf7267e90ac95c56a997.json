Does it matter?", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration reported a river of red ink Friday.\n\nThe federal deficit for the 2019 budget year surged 26% from 2018 to $984.4 billion \u2014 its highest point in seven years. The gap is widely expected to top $1 trillion in the current budget year and likely remain there for the next decade.\n\nThe year-over-year widening in the deficit reflected such factors as revenue lost from the 2017 Trump tax cut and a budget deal that added billions in spending for military and domestic programs.\n\nForecasts by the Trump administration and the Congressional Budget Office project that the deficit will top $1 trillion in the 2020 budget year, which began Oct. 1. And the CBO estimates that the deficit will stay above $1 trillion over the next decade.\n\nThose projections stand in contrast to President Donald Trump's campaign promises that even with revenue lost initially from his tax cuts, he could eliminate the budget deficit with cuts in spending and increased growth generated by the tax cuts.\n\nHere are some questions and answers about the current state of the government's finances.\n\n___\n\nWHAT HAPPENED?\n\nThe deficit has been rising every year for the past four years. It's a stretch of widening deficits not seen since the early 1980s, when the deficit exploded with President Ronald Reagan's big tax cut.\n\nFor 2019, revenues grew 4%. But spending jumped at twice that rate, reflecting a deal that Trump reached with Congress in early 2018 to boost spending.\n\n___\n\nWHY DOESN'T WASHINGTON DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?\n\nFiscal hawks have long warned of the economic dangers of running big government deficits. Yet the apocalypse they fear never seems to happen, and the government just keeps on spending.\n\nThere have been numerous attempts by presidents after Reagan to control spending. President George H.W. Bush actually agreed to a tax increase to control deficits when he was in office, breaking his \"Read my lips\" pledge not to raise taxes.\n\nAnd a standoff between President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich did produce a rare string of four years of budget surpluses from 1998 through 2001. In fact, the budget picture was so bright when George W. Bush took office in 2001 that the Congressional Budget Office projected that the government would run surpluses of $5.6 trillion over the next decade.\n\nThat didn't happen. The economy slid into a mild recession, Bush pushed through a big tax cut and the war on terrorism sent military spending surging. Then the 2008 financial crisis erupted and triggered a devastating recession. The downturn produced the economy's first round of trillion-dollar deficits under President Barack Obama and is expected to do so again under Trump.\n\n___\n\nSHOULD WE WORRY?\n\nAs far as most of us can tell, the huge deficits don't seem to threaten the economy or elevate the interest rates we pay on credit cards, mortgages and car loans. And in fact, the huge deficits are coinciding with a period of ultra-low rates rather than the surging borrowing costs that economists had warned would likely occur if government deficits got this high.\n\nThere is even a new school of economic theory known as the \"modern monetary theory.\" It argues that such major economies as the United States and Japan don't need to worry about running deficits because their central banks can print as much money as they need.\n\nYet this remains a distinctly minority view among economists. Most still believe that while the huge deficits are not an immediate threat, at some point they will become a big problem. They will crowd out borrowing by consumers and businesses and elevate interest rates to levels that ignite a recession.\n\nWhat's more, the interest payments on the deficits become part of a mounting government debt that must be repaid and could depress economic growth in coming years. In fact, even with low rates this year, the government's interest payments on the debt were one of the fastest items in the budget, rising nearly 16% to $375.6 billion.\n\n___\n\nHAVEN'T ECONOMISTS BEEN MAKING THESE WARNING FOR DECADES?\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says the day of reckoning is still coming but isn't here yet. Most analysts think any real solution will involve a combination of higher taxes and cost savings in the government's huge benefit programs of Social Security and Medicare.", "description": "The Trump administration reported a river of red ink Friday.
