According to recent statistics, there are nearly 18,000 police agencies across the country. From major city departments to one-sheriff towns, close to 700,000 brave men and women wear a badge of some sort, vowing to put their lives on the line in order to protect your life and mine.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nUp until this past Monday, Steve Pugsley was one of these heroes on the thin blue line. A 29-year veteran of the Colorado Springs Police Department, Steve joined the force in 1991 after serving six years as an officer back in his hometown of Chicago.\n\nBut after being shot at five times in the last 2\u00bd years in Colorado, Steve decided enough was enough.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think pushing my luck any further was smart,\u201d he texted me. \u201cI\u2019ve pushed the limit long enough.\u201d\n\nSteve and I have been friends for over 20 years, and I\u2019ve long admired him as a police officer straight from Central Casting.\n\nWith a cool and calm demeanor, Steve is the guy you want in the middle of a crisis. A member of the bomb squad, as well as a beat cop for years, he\u2019s unflappable \u2013 and indefatigable.\n\nDuring two separate Olympic games in 2002 and 2004, Steve served as a \u201crunner guard\u201d for the Olympic torch relays, which covered thousands of miles. There were some days when he ran more than 30 miles \u2013 and would then get up the next day and do it all over again.\n\nBut the curtain falls on even the most storied career, and this past Monday Steve found himself in the community room of the Falcon substation, a modest outpost that sits just south of the U.S. Air Force Academy. A normal retirement ceremony usually attracts about 50 people \u2013 but there were over 150 jammed inside, every seat taken and others ringing the walls, overflowing out into the lobby.\n\n\u201cTo you it is a call for service,\u201d Steve told his fellow officers, referencing the dozens of emergencies each day. \u201cBut for those we\u2019re calling on, it might be the moment that changes their life, potentially forever.\u201d\n\nAfter the tributes and gifts, Steve stepped up to the lectern and bid farewell in his typical low-key fashion, lauding his fellow officers, but also sharing some lessons from a highly decorated career:\n\n1. Try to learn something new every day. All the world is a classroom. Listen more than you talk. Ask questions. Steve patrolled a gritty part of town and got to know many of the more challenging people on a first-name basis, even learning from some along the way.\n\n2. Beware of ruts. Nothing in life is routine. \u201cTo you it is a call for service,\u201d he told his fellow officers, referencing the dozens of emergencies each day. \u201cBut for those we\u2019re calling on, it might be the moment that changes their life, potentially forever.\u201d\n\n3. Be brave \u2013 but be humble. \u201cInstead of being a badge in front of a person,\u201d he reminded them, \u201cbe a person worthy of wearing the badge.\u201d Humility keeps us grounded \u2013 and teachable. Steve never considered himself superior to anybody, but felt great empathy for everybody. He kept his patrol car trunk filled with hats and gloves for those living on the streets. \u201cNobody freezes to death on my watch,\u201d he said.\n\n4. Stay active \u2013 but activate the right things. \u201cYou can pump all the iron you want, but if you don\u2019t take care of your heart (emotional health) you\u2019re wasting your time,\u201d Steve said. In subtle and sober terms he alluded to the rise in police suicides and the stress and pressures of the role. \u201cDon\u2019t let the job eat you alive. Find your outlet. Talk it out. Look out for your buddy.\u201d\n\n5. Endure. We can often do more than we think we\u2019re capable of doing. An ultra-marathoner, Steve mentioned competing in the grueling Leadville 100 mountain race in 2000 and carrying with him this reminder on a card: \u201cYou\u2019ll never know how far you can go until you\u2019ve gone too far.\u201d He carried that card in his \u201cgo-bag\u201d for the last 19 years of his career.\n\nSteve likened his tenure to the parable of the starfish \u2013 the ancient story of the old man who scoffed at a young boy for throwing the beached creatures back into the sea.\n\n\u201cSon,\u201d the man snickered, \u201cthere are thousands of starfish and only one of you. What difference can you make?\u201d\n\nSmiling, the boy picked up another starfish and tossed it back into the roaring surf.\n\n\u201cI made a difference to that one,\u201d the little guy said softly.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t save them all,\u201d Steve remarked in closing, referencing all the cases and all the people of the city. \u201cBut don\u2019t miss the opportunity to save the one in front of you.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m grateful for Steve and all his fellow police officers near and far, America\u2019s brave guardians who keep watch so that we can live in peace.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM PAUL BATURA", "description": "A normal retirement ceremony usually attracts about 50 people \u2013 but there were over 150 jammed inside, every seat taken and others ringing the walls, overflowing out into the lobby.", "authors": ["Paul Batura", "Paul J.
