Big Billy Vunipola is crocked but England insist they can cope without him", "language": "en", "text": "England have issued a statement of confidence in their cover for Billy Vunipola as the No 8 awaits results of a scan on his ankle.\n\nShould England\u2019s worst fears be confirmed, there is no specialist cover in the 31-man squad but Tom Curry, Mark Wilson and Lewis Ludlam have all filled in at training.\n\nWith passage to the quarter-finals already secure, England are highly unlikely to risk Vunipola in Saturday\u2019s pool match against France, but the greater concern is his fitness for next week\u2019s knock-out clash.\n\nEngland No 8 Billy Vunipola is nervously awaiting the results of a scan on his injured ankle\n\nTom Curry has been has been among the players training at No 8 with Eddie Jones's side\n\nNo other players in the pack possess Vunipola\u2019s ball-carrying ballast so Eddie Jones can ill afford to lose the injury-prone 26-year-old.\n\nWilson is the only player who has started a Test in the No 8 jersey, while Curry stepped into the role when Vunipola withdrew at half-time during Saturday\u2019s victory over Argentina.\n\n\u2018We will know a lot more on Tuesday and he did have a scan as a precaution,\u2019 said scrum coach Neal Hatley.\n\nNO 8 OPTIONS Mark Wilson Age - 30 Caps - 16 Tries - 1 Filled in for Vunipola last autumn and was named player of the series. Reliable operator, often top of the tackle charts, who is described by team-mates as the hardest man in the squad. Turned 30 on Sunday and is England\u2019s most experienced candidate. Lewis Ludlam Age - 23 Caps - 5 Tries - 1 Wildcard choice who has limited experience in the jersey with his club. Selection at No 8 would be the biggest gamble but the energetic, physical rookie has stepped up to every challenge thrown his way so far. Tom Curry Age - 21 Caps - 16 Tries - 3 Has demonstrated his adaptability after switching from No 7 to 6 in the opening rounds. Carries the ball above his weight and stepped up to the role when Vunipola went off injured on Saturday. Triple turnover threat could be unrivalled if partnered with two flankers.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s up and around, walking. He hasn\u2019t been on crutches, a mobility scooter or anything like that. I don\u2019t want to say anything too early. We\u2019re not going to rush these things.\n\n\u2018We knew coming into the tournament how we would have to move people around so we have trained accordingly with the different back rows.\n\n\u2018Mark Wilson has played a lot of eight for us, Tom Curry has played a bit, all of these plans have been in place. Wils played the whole of the autumn for us there at No 8 and was probably one of our stand-out players. Lewis Ludlam has played there a little bit. We\u2019re a team of 31 and we\u2019ve got trust and faith in everyone\u2019s ability.\u2019\n\nIn Vunipola\u2019s absence, Eddie Jones may decide to compensate by selecting alternative players known for busting over the gain-line.\n\nJoe Cokanasiga offers similar Pacific Island power on the wing, while prop Ellis Genge is nicknamed the \u2018baby rhino\u2019 for the way he swats off defenders.\n\nIn previous campaigns, Nathan Hughes has been the closest to a like-for-like replacement for Vunipola but the Bristol No 8 was left out of Jones\u2019 final squad.\n\n\u2018We have got Ellis Genge, Mako Vunipola, Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes and Kyle Sinckler who can pick up the slack when Billy doesn\u2019t play,\u2019 added Hatley.\n\n\u2018Tom has got the ability to carry the ball like someone who is probably five or six kilos heavier.\u2019\n\nEngland have vowed to approach Saturday\u2019s Test with full intensity, despite the fact the loser should avoid the daunting prospect of a semi-final against the No 1 ranked All Blacks.\n\nEngland\u2019s football team found themselves in a similar position at last year\u2019s World Cup and, in a similar vein to Gareth Southgate, their rugby counterparts are likely to rest some key players.\n\nMark Wilson played at No 8 for England last November and looks likely to face France\n\nLewis Ludlam is another contender for Vunipola's spot in the side this weekend\n\n\u2018We had Gareth in for two days but we didn\u2019t really talk about that,\u2019 revealed Hatley.\n\n\u2018You get momentum from winning and we want to win all the games. No team has ever won a World Cup having lost a pool game.\n\n\u2018France is a traditional enemy and we want to beat them. England playing France \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine anyone not taking that full-on serious, 100mph. We want to top the pool and this game puts us top of the pool.\u2019", "description": "NIK SIMON IN TOKYO: England have issued a statement of confidence in their cover for Billy Vunipola as the No 8 awaits results of a scan on his ankle.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/21/19408726-0-image-a-22_1570480123794.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
