Having mostly kept his shiny head well down since he called, fought and lost the 2016 EU referendum, he has now surfaced in what seems like a fairly doomed attempt at rehabilitation. His memoir, For the Record, is soon out, together with media publicity blitz and the usual BBC documentary tie-in, though not this time fronted by the sardonic Michael Cockerell, who usually deals with this sort of stuff.\n\nApparently Cameron is so reviled in some pro-EU parts of the country \u2013 which I see is being currently named \u201cRemainia\u201d \u2013 that bookshops there refuse to stock his new book, which seems a bit, well, un-British.\n\nThis first episode of two is shown this week, and they\u2019ve wisely skipped the Bullingdon Club and the huskies and gone straight in to the Brexit story \u2013 the unexpected victory at the 2015 general election, the awks moment when he realises he actually will have to deliver on the In/Out referendum he solemnly placed in the Conservative manifesto, the betrayals, lies and failures of the Remain and Leave campaign, and the premature end of his political career and the sinking of his reputation.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAlthough he and the rest of us have been through the wars since, Cameron is still only 52, and now that he\u2019s finished his memoir he will have many arduous years to come trying to restore his reputation. We might not have heard the last of him after all. In any case, his relations will wreck the Tory party conference, Boris Johnson\u2019s first (maybe last) as leader, which might bring Cameron some mild consolation.\n\nThere can have been no more vital a question during the Second World War than that posed by BBC2\u2019s Thursday night documentary 1944: Should We Bomb Auschwitz?. It tells the story of the escape form the death camp and subsequent testimony of Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler, whose detailed account of the atrocities committed there presented the allies with an acute dilemma. With resources already focused on the Italy campaign and the D-Day landings in Normandy, the question of diverting efforts to destroy the death camps was one question, More important was the more moral dilemma about the numbers of innocent prisoners who would inevitably be killed in an era long before \u201cprecision\u201d bombings and drone strikes, and the net effects on the Nazi campaign of genocide. As it is, Auschwitz still stands as a monument to human depravity. By the way, Rise of the Nazis, which ends its run this week, reminds us of how and where it all started.\n\nSara Pascoe is very funny, which makes the case of catching her presenting Comedians Giving Lectures, a bit of original programming from Dave. First up is Nish Kumar on Brexit, a perfect pairing of man and topic, and he\u2019s followed by Tom Allen on Denise van Outen (so to speak) and Natasia Demetriou on \u201cThe Anatomy of the Vagina\u201d , which, even now, is quite avant-garde.\n\nMore new comedy comes from Defending the Guilty, a sombre-sounding title for a sitcom about an idealistic but useless pupil barrister who is happy to take on the cases of clients who are plainly guilty as charged. You don\u2019t have to be a lord justice of appeal, or something, to realise that this may not be the best way for lawyer Will (Will Sharpe) to make a living.\n\nEqually entertaining is the continuing Stath Lets Flats, which is about incompetent estate agents and their helpless, desperate, skint clients. Jamie Demetriou, Al Roberts and the aforementioned Natasia Demetriou star.\n\nLast, Last Night of the Proms. This mostly harmless outpouring of confused patriotism makes its eccentric annual appearance: flags (union and European Union), Elgar and \u201cRule Britannia!\u201d. No Brexit glockenspiel, though, we hope.\n\nThe Cameron Years (BBC1, Thursday 9pm); 1944: Should We Bomb Auschwitz?
