And the people who are targeted to receive them still believe them,\u201d she said.\n\nFacebook did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAccording to Legum\u2019s newsletter, Popular Information, the Trump campaign has used stock photo models to offer phony endorsements in Facebook videos. The attractive models smile as voiceovers offer support for the president.\n\nIn a NowThis feature on his reporting, Legum said that the campaign has also used Facebook ads to ask voters to make an immediate donation in order to enter contests to win items such as a signed \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. The contests are said to have enrollment deadlines of 11:59 p.m. on that given day \u2015 but they actually are promoted for multiple days or even weeks, Legum said.\n\nThe ads are designed, he said, to \u201cscam\u201d Trump supporters.\n\nThe often politically divisive sentiments pushed by Trump\u2019s ads have also raised concerns. Following the shooting last month in which a gunman targeting Mexicans killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas \u2015 having allegedly acted on a white supremacist manifesto decrying a \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d \u2015 a review of Trump\u2019s campaign ads showed he used the same language to describe immigration.\n\nEarlier this year, about 2,200 ads claimed an \u201cinvasion\u201d was taking place, many of them warning social media users that \u201cillegal immigration is a serious threat to our country.\u201d\n\nClarification: This story has been updated to clarify that the conference was held at George Washington University but was not sponsored by the school.", "description": "In rebuking the platform, the 2016 presidential candidate cited a \"disturbing\" report on the Trump campaign's deceptions.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8142f33b00002b88d64f30.jpeg?cache=smpcb7poqb&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
