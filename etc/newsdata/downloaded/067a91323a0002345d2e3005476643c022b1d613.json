Politico obtained audio of the call, which took place in August.\n\n\u201cI want to make this a win-win if we can,\u201d Graham told the so-called minister.\n\nI don\u2019t want to impose sanctions on our ally Turkey; I want us to move toward a free trade agreement. \u2026 The problem with the S-400 is that if Turkey activates it, other people want to buy it, and that\u2019s really going to put pressure on our alliances. We\u2019re pretty firm about that.\n\nGraham has previously warned Ankara of penalties if it activated the S-400 systems purchased from Russia over the summer, and more recently introduced a bill in the Senate that would sanction Turkey over its military offensive against Kurdish fighters in Syria, however during the call the senator took credit for restraining his fellow Republicans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve convinced my Republican colleagues to stand down,\u201d he said, adding later: \u201cthe reason we don't have sanctions now is because I\u2019ve helped President Trump ... say \u2018no.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe senator also appeared to undercut his recent statements on Turkey\u2019s incursion into Syria, telling the phony minister he wanted Washington to \u201cmake sure that Turkey is protected from this threat in Syria,\u201d and that he is \u201csympathetic to the YPG problem.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com War, sanctions or deal: Trump says US has \u2018three choices\u2019 with Turkey in Syria\n\nGraham ultimately offered to set up a \u201cquiet\u201d phone call \u201coff the record\u201d between Presidents Trump and Erdogan to sort out the S-400 issue, repeatedly suggesting a free trade deal could smooth over the dispute, but said it would be \u201cimpossible to stop the sanctions\u201d if the missile systems were activated.\n\nA spokesman for Graham confirmed that the call took place to Politico.\n\n\u201cWe have been successful in stopping many efforts to prank Senator Graham and the office, but this one slipped through the cracks,\u201d said the spokesman, Kevin Bishop. \u201cThey got him.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Russian prankster duo strikes again, say they tricked Macron with fake call from Ukraine\u2019s Zelensky\n\nThe two tricksters behind the prank, Alexey Stolyarov and Vladimir Kuznetsov, otherwise known as Lexus and Vovan, have made a name for themselves with a series of phone pranks on high-profile officials, previously getting over on Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, French President Emmanuel Macron, as well as North Macedonia\u2019s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.\n\nAlso on rt.com Alexander the Great relation or Russian prankster?
