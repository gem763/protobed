The once-thriving seaside location had hit hard times over the past two decades, especially because of competition from casinos opening in nearby states, but an influx of cash from sports wagering is seeing revenue numbers spike over the past year with August\u2019s total showing significant growth.\n\nAll told, New Jersey\u2019s total gaming revenue for last month was $352.8 million. This represents a 16.1 percent jump over last August\u2019s totals. Sports gaming led the way with $25.2 million in sports wagering across the state, a significant uptick from $9.2 million a year ago.\n\nNew Jersey was the second state to legalize sports betting in June 2018 after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, known as PASPA, that limited sports betting to Nevada for the last 25 years, according to the USA Today Network.\n\nThe decision opened a market of state-sanctioned gambling that was expected to lift the fortunes of racetracks and Atlantic City casinos, according to NorthJersey.com. The expectations have, so far, proved to be true. Within 10 months of legalized sports betting, $2.3 billion in wagers had been made, according to the Associated Press. The rapid growth of sports betting led Gov. Phil Murphy to declare that the Garden State would overtake Nevada in sports betting revenue by 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA number of Atlantic City casinos posted strong numbers in August with sports wagering a significant part of the equation, according to the Attorney General.\n\nResults Digital weighed in with sports gaming numbers of $6.697 million, strong postings when stacked against $2.97 million year over last.
