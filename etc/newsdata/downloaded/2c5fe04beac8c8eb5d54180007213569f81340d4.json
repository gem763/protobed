Dressed in a black Vivienne Westwood number, silver choker and towering tartan platform boots, she is sporting a panoply of piercings, her hair pulled into braids. It is a contrast with previous looks: specs and baggy basketball sweats, a full nu-metal uniform (Slipknot tee, studded wristbands) and even a mermaid phase, during which she called herself Wavy Spice. To call Frasqueri a shapeshifter would be an understatement.\n\nAlthough known mostly as a rapper, over her career she has mined everything from emo and punk to ballroom, folk and lo-fi house. Today she declares herself a \u201clittle hippy stoner\u201d and \u201can old soul\u201d, \u201chonest, normal and lovely\u201d and \u201cvery intelligent\u201d. She can also be, she admits \u201ca bit of a brat sometimes\u201d. The phrase that comes up most consistently, however, is how rock\u2019n\u2019roll she is.\n\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s not the music I\u2019m making, [rock\u2019n\u2019roll is] my spirit, it\u2019s my soul, it\u2019s how I dress, how I act, how I talk, how I love, how I make music, how I have sex, how I eat,\u201d says the 27-year-old, absentmindedly spearing a slice of mango.\n\nFrasqueri landed from New York this morning and, after a brief sleep, made her way here for a full day of promo for her new single, the flamboyantly funky Sugar Honey Iced Tea (S.H.I.T.). It\u2019s as confrontational as you might expect: the first verse is a middle finger to her detractors \u2013 \u201cI know you mad that I\u2019m famous / I know you mad that I made it\u201d \u2013 while the second addresses the time in 2017 when she threw soup (butternut squash, FYI) on a racist man who was abusing black teenagers on the New York subway. \u201cI instantly got up,\u201d she says, \u201ccos if you\u2019re playing with children, and you\u2019re playing with black children, you\u2019re not about to get away with that. Not in front of me. I\u2019m not a docile, complacent person when it comes to racial aggressions.\u201d Later in the verse, she likens herself to a female Colin Kaepernick. \u201cThat was a metaphor about me standing for what I believe in. Even if I\u2019m standing alone. Even if it puts me in danger.\u201d\n\nFrasqueri is no stranger to adversity. An NYC native of Puerto Rican descent, she was raised in Harlem until the age of 10, when her mother died from an Aids-related illness. The grieving pre-teen was shunted into various foster homes, one of which she has previously described as physically abusive, before running away to live with her grandmother in the Lower East Side when she was 15. She started songwriting when she was 12. \u201cI was a happy-go-lucky gothic girl who had an optimistic spirit cos I was suffering a lot at home,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d been suffering all of my life. I think comedians and artists, we do that. We know how to be the life of the party and enjoy exuberance outside of pain.\u201d\n\nWhen Frasqueri dropped her first single on SoundCloud in 2010, fans were drawn to a savvy artist who could flip from utter irreverence (Bitch I\u2019m Posh) to shrewd commentary on colonial history (Yaya). For her new record, she is trying something new: due next year it was recorded between Puerto Rico, Los Angeles and New York, and saw her work with jazz musicians, freestyling and sometimes creating as many as 10 songs in three hours.\n\nAccording to Frasqueri, one of the record\u2019s producers has compared her creative output to Joni Mitchell. \u201cHe said: \u2018You\u2019re emotional and you\u2019re powerful and you\u2019re this really witchy woman. Joni was with all the guys and they loved and revered her and I see you do that. You come into these spaces with all of these musicians and men and you\u2019re just one of the gang. You love to have a good time, you have the purest heart, you\u2019re rock\u2019n\u2019roll in so many different ways.\u2019 I was like: \u2018You\u2019re so right.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor someone so often candid and outspoken \u2013 whether alleging that Ariana Grande\u2019s 7 Rings was a rip-off of her track Mine on social media or confronting misogynist students at a Cambridge University show in 2017 \u2013 it is surprisingly tricky to navigate certain parts of conversation with Frasqueri. As we segue from the themes in her single to wider topics to do with society, such as whether the US has regressed since 2017, she seems unwilling to talk. \u201cTo be honest with you, I\u2019m really trying to make my articles centred around music solely,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cA lot of journalists like to ask a lot of questions that are very non sequitur to the topic at hand. I don\u2019t want to go into public zeitgeist because I don\u2019t do press a lot and I\u2019m allowing you to do this and ask me questions and I\u2019m very intelligent so I talk a lot but I can\u2019t go into worldly issues. This is about Princess Nokia music.\u201d\n\nShe is similarly reluctant to discuss the clear ballroom influences in her single\u2019s video; in this instance she is wary about being seen as a spokesperson for an important part of the LGBTQ community. \u201cBallroom is a tricky topic that I\u2019m not going to bring up. People want to latch on to it because it\u2019s very popular right now. I don\u2019t want to be a spokesperson for it because once I say I vogued in high school, people want to latch on to that, and they don\u2019t want to latch on to other things that are more important.\u201d She stops for a breath. \u201cI just have to be very adamant on these things.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lean, mean...

She also finds it exhausting, she says, that people seem to want to sensationalise her soundbites. As a woman of colour, she feels used and would rather talk about politics on her own terms, on her own platform. While it makes the interview a little uncomfortable in places, she remains disarmingly direct.\n\nOne track on her next album \u2013 which she is still working on \u2013 examines social media and its impact on mental wellbeing, in particular her own. It is unsettling to hear that Frasqueri \u2013 a woman whose 2016 track Tomboy celebrated \u201cmy little titties and my phat belly\u201d \u2013 has struggled with confidence issues.\n\n\u201cAll my life I was fine with how I looked. I\u2019d have small disorders about myself,\u201d she says. But the advent of social media \u2013 \u201cespecially as a musician trying to keep up with the zeitgeist\u201d \u2013 has taken its toll; she describes \u201cdeveloping facial and body dysmorphia while touring\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have to get ready every day now, which I never used to,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to go onstage with no makeup on. And then I realised I was looking a little crazy and I had to grow up a bit and look more presentable as a woman. That line [in her new song] \u2018I look in my mirror\u2019 is about how I look at women and wonder why don\u2019t I look like that. Why isn\u2019t my hair \u2013 and my lips and my skin \u2013 like that? It\u2019s a very common thing for all women to think. I just realised one day that this is an illusion. I really have to love myself again. I never want to be in that dark place ever again.\u201d\n\nThe new record arrives in 2020, as well as a photobook documenting the last five years of Spanish Harlem\u2019s Puerto Rican festival. Before that, Frasqueri makes her screen debut in the indie flick Angelfish, which she is also exec-producing. She also runs the Smart Girl Club community collective and has a show on Apple\u2019s Beats 1. It all sounds quite exhausting, but she makes time for herself, too. As we finish up, she decides that the new record is about self-care. \u201cI\u2019m so in love with myself, that\u2019s what this album is about. Romancing myself, loving myself, cooking dinner for myself. I\u2019m really just living my dreams.\u201d Doesn\u2019t get more punk than that.\n\nSugar Honey Iced Tea (S.H.I.T.) is out now via Platoon.
