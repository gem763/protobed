Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Rath Hoffman said the list would be made available later this week after the Defense Department finishes notifying lawmakers with affected projects in their districts and foreign embassies with impacted projects in their countries.\n\nDuring a briefing on Tuesday, top Pentagon officials said the $3.6 billion will fund 175 miles of new or reconstructed wall along the border with Mexico and help reduce the need for American troops deployed there. Among the projects that the money will fund is a new wall along the U.S. military\u2019s Barry M. Goldwater Bombing Range in Arizona, which abuts the border with Mexico, officials said.\n\nThe Pentagon will obtain the $3.6 billion by taking money away from 127 military construction projects that Congress already funded in recent years. About half of the $3.6 billion will come from projects within the United States and its territories; the other half will come from construction projects the U.S. military was planning to carry out in foreign countries.\n\nThe Pentagon said the projects weren\u2019t being canceled, and wouldn\u2019t even be delayed, so long as Congress agreed to \u201cbackfill\u201d the funds and once again appropriate money for the projects. Democrats have balked at the suggestion, noting that they have already funded the projects in question. They say the action flies in the face of Congress\u2019s constitutionally-mandated power of the purse.\n\nThere are currently about 3,000 active-duty troops and 2,000 national guardsmen serving on the U.S. border. Trump deployed them to help support U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has been coping with large numbers of arrivals of primarily Central American migrant families.", "description": "Defense Secretary Mark T.
