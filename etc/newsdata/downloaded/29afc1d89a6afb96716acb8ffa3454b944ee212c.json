Many Japanese companies in electronic parts and semiconductors ship goods to China, where they are assembled to make final products destined for the United States and other markets.\n\nIncreasing signs of slowing global demand have made Japan's policymakers less confident about an early pick-up in global growth and more open to debating policy easing.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Oct. 11 outlined the first phase of a trade deal and suspended a threatened tariff hike, but officials on both sides said much more work needed to be done.\n\n\"There are some positive signs from the U.S.-China trade dispute and Japan's exports may stop falling,\" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.\n\n\"But we need to continue to watch closely the progress of trade talks between the two nations as trade conflicts could reignite.\"\n\nThe Finance Ministry will announce trade data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Oct. 21 (2350 GMT, Oct.20).", "description": "Japan September exports to fall for tenth month on global slowdown: Reuters poll", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9H0CO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
