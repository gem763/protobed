About 30% to 40% of these patients fail to respond to first-line treatments such as antidepressants, most of which take at least four weeks to show an effect.\n\nWhile final approvals are up to the European Commission, it generally follows the panel's recommendation and announces its decision within a couple of months.", "description": "J&J's depression drug Spravato wins European panel vote", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9H15R_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
