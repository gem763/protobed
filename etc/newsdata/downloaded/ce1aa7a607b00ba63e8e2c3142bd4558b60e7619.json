But smart displays are great as far as freebies go, especially since they serve as good companions to smart doorbells. Whether you buy the Google product or the one from Amazon, you\u2019ll be able to use the smart display to see who\u2019s ringing the doorbell, and talk with visitors via two-way audio. The displays also make for good digital photo frames and smart alarm clocks.\n\nTo get a free Echo Show 5, add the Ring Video Doorbell 2 (or the more expensive Ring Video Doorbell Pro) to your cart from this page. The smart display comes only in the charcoal color.\n\nFor the Nest Hello doorbell, add it to your cart and you\u2019ll see a note in your cart above the total that says you get a free Google Nest Hub. It only comes in the chalk color; as with the Echo Show 5, you can\u2019t change the color.", "description": "For a limited time, Best Buy is including a Google Nest Hub with purchase of Nest\u2019s Hello video doorbell.
