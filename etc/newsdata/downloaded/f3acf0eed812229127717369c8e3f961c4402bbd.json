Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nWhile these details must be reserved for political hypernerds, the wider ramifications may concern us all.\n\nIn six days, the Commons is slated for a rare Saturday sitting to debate any deal Johnson has done with the EU27. There is every chance it will pass, regardless of what it is.\n\nA few days ago, I asked a hard Brexity ex-cabinet minister if he\u2019d vote for what we took the deal to be. Yes, he said. But isn\u2019t it worse than Theresa May\u2019s? Yes. So you\u2019ll vote for a worse deal than the deal that was so terrible that you thrice voted against it? Yes. Do you begin to detect the stirrings, I wondered, of a paradox? He smiled, and fell silent.\n\nThis morning, on the very Sky show that diverted Corbyn from his allotment, Sophy Ridge had a spookily similar exchange with Jacob Rees-Mogg. \u201cThe deal seems very similar to Mrs May\u2019s which you described as completely cretinous, bureaucratic and a betrayal of common sense. So have you changed your mind?\u201d\n\n\u201cChurchill often ate his own words,\u201d the lounging lizard replied with the reptilian smugness we all enjoy so much, \u201cand found it a nourishing diet.\u201d\n\nIf men of such unyielding principle are happy to gorge on their hypocrisy like dogs eating their own sick, a vast majority of the ERG can be relied on to betray the ethos of their Spartan forebears.\n\nThe DUP may resist the deal and its accompanying bribes, perhaps swaying some ERG votes in the process. But with most of the expelled Tories and a fair smattering of Labour MPs expected to back it, the probability is that the deal, whatever it might be, will pass.\n\nOf course, there is a strong chance that there will be no deal, or that the deal will be materially different from the one anticipated. If it jettisoned the border in the Irish Sea in favour of customs checks from above by Daenarys Targaryen\u2019s surviving dragon, nothing at this stage could come as a shock.\n\nBut any deal put to the Commons on Saturday will present the moment of ultimate truth for the Remainer alliance. If Labour whipped its MPs to join the SNP, the Lib Dems, the smaller opposition parties and some of the Tory outcasts, it would probably have the numbers to mandate a second referendum offering both the deal and the option to remain.\n\nThis is what the party\u2019s larger beasts and most of its members (regardless of that blatant conference stitch-up) plainly want, and what Keir Starmer apparently thinks is the policy. \u201cIf Boris Johnson does manage to negotiate a deal,\u201d he said yesterday, \u201cwe will insist that it is put back to the people in a confirmatory vote.\u201d\n\nHere, as elsewhere, Corbyn remains an unusually nervous tortoise. From time to time, under pressure, he\u2019s poked out his head, looked approvingly on a referendum, instantly taken fright, and retracted it.\n\nA few days ago, with all the momentum for holding a referendum before a general election, Corbyn appeared to concur.\n\nToday he withdrew into his shell, cautioning against subjecting any deal to a people\u2019s vote before an election.\n\nToo much energy has been wasted bemoaning the obfuscation, vacillation, conscientious objecting and absenteeism without leave that has alienated swathes of supporters during this silly little proxy civil war.\n\nEven surviving superfans sense in their bones that he\u2019s blown it; that the miracle of the last election won\u2019t be repeated against a different Tory opponent in the afterglow of a deal spun by the papers (the ones that depicted May\u2019s doppelganger deal as Chamberlain-esque appeasement) as a Churchillian triumph.\n\nA tortoise of enviably rigid self-belief, he must reckon he will catch the hare, as he almost did two years ago, and overtake it on the line. Perhaps, as then, he is right and everyone else is mistaken. But all the odds and polls say otherwise, and the fact that they were wrong before has no predictive bearing on the future.\n\nEqually, the fact that time has been so short for so long doesn\u2019t mean the next final moment of truth won\u2019t be just that. If a deal with the EU is struck, Saturday almost certainly will be the Commons\u2019 last chance to legislate for a second referendum.\n\nIf so, there are fewer than six days either for Corbyn to have his mind decisively changed \u2013 which on the form book looks a long shot \u2013 or for John McDonnell to launch a more effective coup than the silent one which seems to have proceeded through the U-bend like its noisier predecessors.\n\nFailing that, if he enables the passing of a deal with no referendum attached, the campaign to immortalise Jeremy Corbyn in marble starts next Sunday. But in that event, whether he gets the statue or no more than a small panel in the Brexeaux Tapestry, he will be forever remembered as a hero of this benighted age.", "description": "If a deal is agreed and approved by the Commons, who would deserve the Brexit Hero of Heroes statue in Parliament Square?
