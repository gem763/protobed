Brush the skin of the snoek with a little melted butter or olive oil to prevent it sticking and butterfly the fish open, like a book.\n\nPlace the fish, skin-side down, onto a hinged grid lined with foil. Brush the flesh side of the snoek with the paprika garlic butter and place over medium-hot coals.\n\nGrill the flesh side first for about 3 minutes, before cooking the snoek skin-side down for a further 10\u201315 minutes, basting the fish with the flavoured butter throughout the process.\n\nWhen ready, the flesh should flake easily under a fork but still be juicy. Serve the snoek with a green salad, garlic bread or the Shredded Fennel Salad on page 25.\n\nReprinted with permission of Georgia East from her new cookbook - West Coast Wander, published by Penguin Random House Publishers.", "description": "Whether eaten fried in batter, salted and dried or smoked, snoek is enjoyed all along the West Coast, and makes up most of the local diet. High in omega-3 fatty acids, snoek is a deliciously meaty fish, its long knitting needle bones easily unearthed for safe eating.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9513/25fcc17dc79b4cc99a022898983accdc.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
