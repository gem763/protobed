Taylor has been much more than a stopgap for the Nationals", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nMichael A. Taylor's contributions after starter Victor Robles was sidelined have played a sizable role in this postseason run. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nThe meeting convened in the depths of the stadium, in the office of Harrisburg hitting coach Brian Rupp. It was early July, and Michael A. Taylor was playing center field for the Class AA Senators. He had been sent down by the Washington Nationals after his struggles at the plate led to strikeouts 42 percent of the time. A few coaches filed into the office and sat with Taylor as Manager Matt LeCroy pulled up the video.\n\nLeCroy had waited to do this. He spent the early days of Taylor\u2019s tenure in Harrisburg gauging how the former everyday major leaguer was handling the demotion. After four or five games, he recognized the 28-year-old\u2019s confidence was shaken.\n\n\u201cYou could sense it,\u201d LeCroy said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a bad attitude, but he didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nThe manager called Jonathan Tosches, the Nationals\u2019 manager of advance scouting, and asked him to put together a highlight tape. He wanted to pump Taylor up, show him the player he could be. Maybe this would trigger him to become the hitter he\u2019d become at times throughout his career. LeCroy pressed play.\n\nTaylor transformed on the tape. He smacked doubles down the lines and in the gaps. He blasted home runs everywhere. He swiped bases with abandon. There he was, in Game 4 of the 2017 National League Division Series, belting a grand slam into a cheering crowd at Nationals Park. The screen went dark. LeCroy handed Taylor a thumb drive.\n\n\u201cI really appreciate them doing that,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThey were great at helping me remember [the player I\u2019ve been] and also move forward.\u201d\n\n[The Nationals\u2019 unforgettable season is about to reach another level]\n\nThree months later, what Taylor puzzled out in Harrisburg proved pivotal. His contributions when called upon, as a surprise pinch-hitter, as a center fielder after a mild right hamstring strain sidelined starter Victor Robles, have played a sizable role in this Nationals postseason run. He has still struggled at times with the bat, and his error in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series could have ended up being costlier than it was, but he has given the Nationals what they needed. He allowed the team space to not rush back Robles.\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance the 22-year-old Robles returns this week, maybe as soon as Monday. Taylor will then return to his usual roles of pinch-runner and defensive replacement. It would fit in a season of up and down, and it\u2019d give the Nationals a seasoned bench option to use against the Cardinals in a series which they already lead 2-0.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been unbelievable since he\u2019s come back up,\u201d Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said of Taylor. \u201cHe understands his role. He\u2019s been really good at it.\u201d\n\nEverything changed in Harrisburg. Taylor worked with Rupp to shorten his swing again and keep the barrel of his bat in the zone longer. He continued analyzing pitchers\u2019 pickoff moves to hone the base-stealing approach he might need later. He shagged flyballs and threw the bases from center and right field before games because General Manager Mike Rizzo wanted him ready if they needed him to replace an injured outfielder, or as a defensive replacement for the playoffs. (Or, it turns out, both.)\n\n\n\nTaylor put the Nationals on the board with a home run in the third inning during Game 2 of the NLCS. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nThe hitting still came slowly. His batting average hovered between .220 and .240, and he still didn\u2019t feel comfortable at the plate. LeCroy remembered a late July game in Portland, Maine, when he thought things might change. Taylor drove a 3-0, \u201creally good fastball\u201d over the fence in center, his third home run in a week. But then he struck out at least once in 15 of the next 16 games, and his batting average sank again.\n\nThe advantage of major league players playing in the minors is that they don\u2019t worry about stats. Taylor disregarded his numbers, something he looked at in the majors, and searched instead for the rhythm every hitter craves. But by late August, Taylor felt no better. Then, for reasons he still can\u2019t explain, he felt good again two weeks before the Senators\u2019 season ended. He went 3 for 5 one night, collected another hit the next and a week later went 4 for 4 with four doubles.\n\n\u201cI was finally able to get that feeling,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI just tried to repeat over and over.\u201d\n\n[When the sun goes down, Adam Eaton comes up big again to propel Nationals in Game 2]\n\nHe executed toward the end of the regular season, when the Nationals sewed up a postseason berth and he played consistently. He sprayed three extra-base hits in his last six at-bats of the regular season. The performance emboldened Martinez to use Taylor \u2014 off the team because of his bat three months earlier \u2014 as a pinch-hitter in the biggest moment of the season. Milwaukee Brewers super-reliever Josh Hader plunked Taylor in the eighth inning of the wild-card game, a hit-by-pitch that ultimately sparked the game-winning rally.\n\nThe Nationals needed him later when, in Game 2 of the NLDS, Robles departed in the eighth inning with the mild right hamstring strain. Taylor stepped forward yet again to replace an injured outfielder and become the Nationals\u2019 starting center fielder.\n\nHe has contributed in myriad ways since, small things like singling to flip the lineup over the pitcher\u2019s spot in Game 4 of the NLDS. The next inning, Ryan Zimmerman drilled a home run to break the game open. He has done big things, too, such as his difficult, diving catch in center to secure the last out of Game 5 in the NLDS to beat the juggernaut Los Angeles Dodgers. His home run in Game 2 of the NLCS against the Cardinals staked starter Max Scherzer a small early lead on a day when it was all he needed.\n\nThat night, a reporter asked Taylor about his flyball homer. The outfielder misunderstood and thought he meant the line drive that flew by him in the eighth inning. He laughed and explained he couldn\u2019t hear the ball make contact, which made it more difficult to judge. The homer, he added, surprised him. Flyballs hadn\u2019t carried in Busch Stadium until his, when what once looked lost seemed important again.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure quite how high it was going to go,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nSvrluga: The Nationals\u2019 rotation encountered a knife fight and brought a bazooka.
