Police want a word.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cI REALLY HAVE NO FEAR OF NOTHING BREATHING\u203c\ufe0f\u201d a caption on one of the woman\u2019s videos declares.\n\nAD\n\nCommenters chimed in with disapproval and derision.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t cross barriers for videos,\u201d one wrote. \u201cI\u2019m so glad your CARELESS actions didn\u2019t harm this animal,\u201d said another.\n\nAD\n\nThe Bronx Zoo seemed equally aghast. It says it received a report on Saturday that someone had climbed over a \u201cvisitor safety barrier\u201d at its African lion exhibit.\n\n\u201cThis action was a serious violation and unlawful trespass that could have resulted in serious injury or death,\u201d the zoo said in a statement, adding that it has a \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d for such behavior.\n\nNew York police are investigating. As of Tuesday night no arrest had been made, according to a department statement.\n\nAD\n\nThe Washington Post could not reach the unidentified woman in the videos for comment, and zoo spokesman Max Pulsinelli declined to provide more information on the incident Tuesday.\n\nHow the woman ended up leaving the lion exhibit is unclear. Videos suggest her fence-hop elicited alarm but little immediate action from bystanders.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCan you tell her to get back?\u201d an onlooker asks well after the woman began gesturing toward the lion, which stands mostly still after taking a couple of steps in her direction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not safe,\u201d another adds.\n\n\u201cI told her; she don\u2019t listen to me,\u201d a man responds.\n\nPeople visiting the New York zoo later this week were similarly concerned by the rogue woman\u2019s actions. Some worried that her misconduct could have repercussions for future guests.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt this exhibit, there\u2019s low walls, so you want to get close enough to see what\u2019s going on, but you don\u2019t want to have these high fences in front of all the exhibits,\u201d one man, John Rubbo, told CBS New York. \u201cIt takes the fun out of the zoo.\u201d\n\nStories abound of overeager visitors whose quests to get closer to zoo animals have landed them in trouble.\n\nJust last week, a North Dakota woman pleaded guilty to trespassing after jumping a rail to touch an ape and take a selfie; she received a $300 fine and about a year of probation. The Bronx Zoo, too, has seen other incidents of guest trespass \u2014 sometimes with dire consequences.\n\nAD\n\nBack in 2012, a 25-year-old was mauled after leaping from a monorail train into the den of a Siberian tiger, according to NBC New York. Staff rescued the man after distracting the animal with fire extinguishers \u2014 but not before the visitor suffered wounds to his arms, legs and back in addition to broken bones seemingly suffered from his jump.\n\nAD\n\nMore recent incidents at the Bronx Zoo have been less grisly. In 2016, police detained two people over two days for venturing into off-limits areas, CBS New York reported. One man climbed a railing toward a snow leopard enclosure, while a woman blew past signs to the back of an exhibit to take photos, police told the news station.\n\nThe woman received a court summons for trespass, according to police. The man did not face charges \u2014 though he did lose his season pass.\n\nRead more:\n\nSome of America\u2019s top zoos still use bullhooks on elephants.
