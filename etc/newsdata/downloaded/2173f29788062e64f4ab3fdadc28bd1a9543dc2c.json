It was a fine way for the 18-year-old to celebrate his new five-year deal and the latest in a growing list of reasons for Frank Lampard to give thanks to Chelsea\u2019s flourishing academy.\n\nMK Dons v Liverpool, Manchester United v Rochdale: Carabao Cup \u2013 live! Read more\n\nThere were plenty of positives as Lampard collected his first home win of the season. Chelsea had six youth players on the pitch and four more on the bench by the end of this 7-1 romp, with Ian Maatsen and Tino Anjorin coming on their debuts midway through the second half. Billy Gilmour, bright and inventive in midfield, caught the eye on his first start. Marc Guehi, only 19, belied his tender years with an assured debut in central defence. And Reece James, the youngster tipped to take Cesar Azpilicueta\u2019s place at right-back one day, introduced himself to the first team with a lovely goal, curling in a precise shot from 25 yards with eight minutes left.\n\nBut Lampard, whose side host Manchester United in the fourth round, wants more. He was unhappy that Chelsea missed a chance to keep their first clean sheet of the season and his analysis even included criticism of Hudson-Odoi\u2019s performance in the first half. Lampard said that the left winger, grasping for sharpness on his return from a serious achilles injury, had ignored instructions to run behind Grimsby\u2019s defence. Strong words were required in the dressing room at half-time.\n\nYet Hudson-Odoi grew into the game in the second half, as did Christian Pulisic on the opposite flank, and Lampard would also heap generous praise on his youngsters. \u201cThe two young lads improved the team when they came on,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said.\n\n\u201cBilly Gilmour ran the game from midfield. Marc Guehi was solid. The opportunities are there but now the hard work really begins to get in there regularly.\u201d\n\nAmid the focus on the kids there was also encouragement for some of Lampard\u2019s more experienced players. Four minutes had passed when Ross Barkley fizzed a low drive inside McKeown\u2019s near post. The hosts built on Barkley\u2019s first goal of the season three minutes later, a deflected cross from James reaching Michy Batshuayi, who grabbed his first goal for Chelsea since January 2018 with a sharp finish.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Reece James (left) scored Chelsea\u2019s fifth on his debut, on a night when Frank Lampard also gave Tino Anjorin his first outing.

This time, however, spot-kick duties did not fall to Barkley, who missed from 12 yards against Valencia last week. Pedro stepped up to send McKeown the wrong way. \u201cThe good thing in my job is I can choose who does things and I chose Pedro to be captain and take a penalty tonight,\u201d Lampard said.\n\nA fourth goal arrived when James conjured a brilliant assist, jabbing a cross into the six-yard box with the outside of his right boot. Zouma prodded in from close range.\n\nJames looked the part after returning from an ankle injury. \u201cReece\u2019s performances last year at Wigan, in the team of the year in the championship, showed the talent he\u2019s got,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great player and person to look up to in Azpilicueta. It\u2019s just the start for Reece.\u201d The best was yet to come from the 19-year-old, who made it 5-1 in the 82nd minute. Pulisic also became more of an influence, creating Batshuayi\u2019s second, and there was still time for Hudson-Odoi, twisting and turning on the left, to round off a comprehensive win.", "description": "Callum Hudson-Odoi struck Chelsea\u2019s seventh and Michy Batshuayi scored twice in a 7-1 victory over Grimsby in the Carabao Cup third round", "authors": ["Jacob Steinberg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17e39078261c22af5ef734106797c405f5cc109a/372_180_2540_1524/master/2540.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d3f49f475d34540c3f90267011889eff", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
