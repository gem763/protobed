(Reuters/Jim Young)\n\nExxonMobil is facing one of its biggest legal threats ever as the state of New York takes the oil and gas giant to court over accusations it misled investors about the costs of dealing with climate change.\n\nThe case, which is set to start Tuesday in state court in Manhattan, is the culmination of years of investigation by the New York attorney general's office, which alleges the company's public estimates of the costs to reduce global warming impact were drastically inflated compared to those used in private discussions among executives.\n\nShould it lose, Exxon faces potentially millions of dollars in penalties as well as a blow to its reputation as it tries to polish its image on climate change. A courtroom defeat may also open the door for more investigations and lawsuits against Exxon and other oil majors over public disclosures about climate change.\n\n\u201cIt might encourage other states to pursue similar actions against Exxon,\u201d said Michael Burger, executive director of Columbia Law School's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.\n\nBut a win by Exxon could stymie efforts by state and local governments to hold oil companies accountable for the damage the use of their products brings to Earth's climate system.\n\nNew York's lawsuit against Exxon doesn't deal directly with the rise of Earth's temperature, or Exxon's contributions to it. It's ultimately a case about accounting.\n\nLetitia James, New York's attorney general, alleges that Exxon keeps two sets of numbers \u2014 one presented to investors and another used internally by planners \u2014 for calculating how greenhouse gas regulations around the world could cut into the company's bottom line.\n\nWhen talking to investors, the company estimated that the regulatory cost per ton of carbon would rise to $80 per ton of carbon by 2040 in certain developed countries, according to New York's complaint filed in October. But inside the company, when planners were deciding where to invest, they pegged that cost at just $40 per ton.\n\nUsing a lower internal cost estimate when making investment decisions made certain extracting and refining projects look more financially attractive than the public-facing numbers would suggest. In the case of 14 oil sands projects in the Canadian province of Alberta, the attorney general's office says Exxon underestimated the regulatory cost by more than $25 billion.\n\nExxon is not disputing the fact that it used dual accounting methods, but argues that it was not duping investors by doing so. Company spokesman Scott J. Silvestri dismissed the allegations as \u201cfalse\u201d and called the investigation \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are confident in the facts and look forward to seeing our company exonerated in court,\u201d Silvestri said in a statement. \u201cThe New York Attorney General\u2019s case is misleading and deliberately misrepresents a process we use to ensure company investments take into account the impact of current and potential climate-related regulations.\u201d\n\nNew York is invoking a particularly powerful anti-fraud statute called the Martin Act. The 98-year-old state law has a lower standard of proof than most other securities law, including federal law. Under it, New York prosecutors do not need to show that a company intended to deceive investors \u2014 only that it misled them about something material to their interests.\n\n\u201cSome people think it's very heavy-handed,\u201d Pat Parenteau, an environmental law professor at Vermont Law School, said of the Martin Act. \u201cAnd maybe it is. But the state is really good at enforcing it.\u201d\n\nThe Martin Act is so strong that companies often choose to settle with New York rather than go to trial. That is what Peabody Energy did in 2015 after a years-long probe into its disclosures about climate change, though the coal giant ultimately did not have to pay any fines.\n\nSince 2007, Exxon has acknowledged the role people play in accelerating global warming. But that has not always been the case. For decades company executives publicly denied the role their products played in accelerating climate change even as its own scientists in the 1980s did cutting-edge climate research.\n\nThe suit alleges that higher-ups within the company, including former chief executive Rex Tillerson, knew about the alleged fraud. Tillerson left his post at Exxon in 2017 to become President Trump's secretary of state.\n\nThe Exxon case will be decided not by a jury but by New York Supreme Court Judge Barry Ostrager, who according to Parenteau as a reputation of being \u201ca real taskmaster.\u201d\n\nNew York's lawsuit against Exxon is hardly the only climate-related court cases with which the oil company is contending. Exxon and several other oil firms are facing a slew of state-level lawsuits from Democrat-led state, county and city governments, which claim the petroleum industry has created a \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d by peddling products that have led to rising seas, drier weather and other effects that are hurting residents from Rhode Island to California.\n\nThe oil companies are asking judges to put those public nuisance cases in federal courts, where past efforts to hold oil firms accountable for the effects of climate change have been dismissed. So far different federal district courts have ruled in different ways, at times dismissing the cases and other times letting them proceed in state court.\n\nIn a series of three emergency requests this month, lawyers for Exxon, BP and Suncor Energy have asked the Supreme Court to stall those cases making their way through state courts.\n\nYou are reading The Energy 202, our must-read tipsheet on energy and the environment.

(Francois Lenoir/Reuters)\n\n\u2014 Rick Perry has just over a month left in office: The Energy Department confirmed Perry is planning to step down Dec. 1, per Reuters. Perry confirmed himself in a video post late last week that he would resign later this year, a move that comes as he faces increasing scrutiny over his role in the administration's communications with Ukraine.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) backs Perry\u2019s potential successor: In a statement, the chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee called for confirming the department\u2019s deputy secretary Dan Brouillette to the lead role \u201cas soon as possible,\" calling him a \u201cgreat choice.\u201d Trump tweeted Friday that he plans to nominate Brouillette, a former George W.

(Reuters/Carlos Jasso)\n\n\u2014 Federal land management employees threatened, assaulted hundreds of times: Staffers in the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service experienced an onslaught of at least 360 threats and assaults from fiscal year 2013 to 2017, according to a Government Accountability Office report.\n\nWhy is this happening: Some of those making threat hold anti-government beliefs. And \"staffers often are the most visible government workers, particularly in rural areas of 12 western states where about one-third of all land in the United States is federally owned,\" The Post's Joe Davidson writes. Employees told the GAO they don\u2019t always report threats, which they are \u201cpart of the job,\" per the GAO report.\n\nSome of those making threat hold anti-government beliefs.

Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) proposal via tweet to ban fracking if she becomes president has sent the oil industry into a flurry. Although banning hydraulic fracturing would have numerous hurdles, industry players have taken it seriously and are considering what a Warren win would mean for them, the Wall Street Journal reports. \u201cCowen Inc. analyst David Deckelbaum said that \u2018coincidentally or not\u2019 since Ms. Warren\u2019s tweet, shares of five exploration and production companies that he studies with significant operations on federal land \u2014 including Devon, Concho and Occidental Petroleum Corp. \u2014 have underperformed by 5% those of companies he tracks that don\u2019t drill much on federal property,\u201d per the report.\n\nA trailer sits on the empty lot of a home destroyed in the Camp fire in Paradise, Calif.

It is important to note that the pair have not made any causal links between the three suspects and the increase of air pollution.\u201d\n\nSports As waters rise, so do concerns for sports teams along coast One team planning for a new $500 million stadium knows it will need to confront many of the dangers posed by climate change Rick Maese\n\nCapital Weather Gang The 2019 ozone hole is the smallest on record since its discovery, but there\u2019s a catch The 2019 ozone hole in the Southern Hemisphere peaked at its smallest level on record, thanks to the polar vortex.
