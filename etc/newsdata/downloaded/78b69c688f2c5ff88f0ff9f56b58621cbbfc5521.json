While he didn't speak English and I don't speak Russian, a translator helped me understand what a day in his life generally looks like. I wasn't able to follow Nogovitsyn into the mine for safety reasons, but we met at a hotel caf\u00e9 in Mirny, and he later sent me photos taken by himself and his fellow miners.\n\nHere's what a typical day looks like for Nogovitsyn as a diamond miner in Siberia.\n\nInnokentiy Nogovitsyn is a diamond miner in Siberia. He works for Alrosa, the world's largest diamond miner by volume.\n\nNogovitsyn lives in Mirny, a diamond mining town in Siberia about 280 miles (450 kilometers) from the Arctic Circle.\n\nMirny has been called a \"mono-city\" because most of the town's roughly 40,000 residents work for Alrosa.\n\nNogovitsyn lives in an apartment in Mirny with his wife and their two children: an 8-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son.\n\nNogovitsyn usually wakes up at 5:30 a.m.\n\nAt 6:15 a.m., Nogovitsyn catches a bus to the mine where he works, called the International mine, just outside of Mirny.\n\nIt's about a 30-minute bus ride to the mine.\n\nThe International mine, which is about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from Mirny, opened in 1999.\n\nThe International mine is open 24/7, with miners rotating through morning, evening, and night shifts. It produces the world's largest content of carats per tonne of ore: seven carats of diamond per tonne of ore.\n\nIn April 2019, a 118.91-carat diamond was mined at the International mine.\n\nBefore every shift, Nogovitsyn and all the other miners get a medical check.\n\nTheir blood pressure and heart rate are measured, and they get checked for any alcohol or drugs in their blood.\n\n\"We are living in Russia, so you have to face it that some people just cannot live without alcohol,\" an Alrosa spokesperson, Diana Petrenko, told Business Insider. \"Some people try to sneak it in. So to make sure there are no people taking in alcohol, they test twice, on the way in and on the way out.\"\n\nIf an employee is caught with alcohol, they're immediately fired, Petrenko said.\n\nAt the mine, it's said that nobody is irreplaceable.\n\nBefore their shift, the miners eat a buffet-style breakfast in the workers' canteen.\n\nAlrosa provides a stipend that covers all of the miners' meals in the canteen.\n\nAfter breakfast, the miners are assigned their particular job for the day, and then they have five minutes to change into their uniforms.\n\nThe uniforms include headlamps, safety helmets, and sturdy boots.\n\nAfter everyone is dressed, it's time to head down into the mine.\n\nNogovitsyn said that during one shift, there are about 100 people in the International mine.\n\nThe miners take an elevator down into the depths of the mine.\n\nThe deepest point of the mine is about 0.62 miles (one kilometer) deep.\n\nTo ride the elevator from the surface to the bottom of the mine takes about 15 minutes, Nogovitsyn said.\n\nIn the mine, Nogovitsyn's job is to monitor methane levels, air flow, and temperature.\n\nHe walks throughout the mine all day monitoring the air. In one shift, he said he walks an average of about 9 miles, or 15 kilometers.\n\nThanks to a ventilation system that pumps in warmed air, the mine stays at a consistent temperature \u2014 even throughout Siberia's harsh winters.\n\nDepending on how deep you are in the mine, the temperature ranges between about 62 degrees Fahrenheit (19 degrees Celsius) to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius).\n\nNogovitsyn eats lunch down in the mine.\n\nThe miners usually pack containers of food from the canteen to eat for lunch.\n\nAt 4:50 p.m., the miners take the elevator back up to the surface.\n\nAt the end of his shift, Nogovitsyn has to write a report and get another quick medical examination, this time just checking for any alcohol in his system.\n\nHe usually leaves the mine at 5:30 p.m. and gets home at 6:00 p.m., about 12 hours after he leaves in the morning.\n\nIn his free time, Nogovitsyn spends time with his family.\n\nAfter he gets home, Nogovitsyn typically does a workout or takes his kids to play in the park, and then he eats dinner with his family.\n\nNogovitsyn gets 76 paid vacation days per year, which, he said, he often spends cycling hundreds of miles across Russia and Europe.\n\nThroughout the year, Nogovitsyn typically works four days in a row followed by one or two days off.\n\nHe works on this schedule for several months and then takes all of his 76 vacation days at once. He said he usually spends half of that time with his family and half of that time embarking on hundreds of miles-long cycling trips across Europe and Asia, often accompanied by his friend and fellow Alrosa miner, Danil.\n\nHe has cycled through countries including France, Norway, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, and Singapore.\n\nSome years, instead of cycling, Nogovitsyn will spend half of his vacation days on hunting or fishing trips with Danil.\n\nAccording to an Alrosa spokesperson, in Russia, diamond mining is classified as a dangerous profession, which is why the miners get so many vacation days.\n\nEmployees of Alrosa and their families have access to a number of social initiatives, Petrenko told Business Insider, including sports facilities, cultural and educational programs, free medical services, corporate pensions, housing programs, and support with real-estate loans.", "description": "Innokentiy Nogovitsyn works for Alrosa, the world's largest diamond miner by volume.
