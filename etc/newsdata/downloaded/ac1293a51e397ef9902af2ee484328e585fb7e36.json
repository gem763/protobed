The product will see Amex, which is the world's biggest issuer of commercial cards by spending and has a relationship with 60% of Fortune 500 companies globally, muscle into a segment that startups like Brex have successfully grabbed a slice of in recent years. Amex will roll out the card in the coming months, though it hasn't revealed an exact date yet. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nAmex is lifting the successful approach leveraged by the likes of Brex for its new product.\n\nBrex, the $2.6 billion valued fintech that's been dubbed Amex 2.0, uses a startup's financial data, including corporate account information and fundraising history, to determine creditworthiness. Likewise, Amex will look to new technology to analyze spending behavior to qualify and determine limits for startups. This approach is similar to Stripe's for its own recently announced corporate credit card product, though the company will be using data gained from transactions made on its payments platform. Using alternative data to determine creditworthiness helps these companies gain a better understanding of prospective clients' credit risk by giving them access to more holistic and real-time data.\n\nThis approach also helps firms solve a crucial pain point for their target market. Typically, startup founders are required to provide a personal guarantee or security deposit for credit cards, forcing them to take substantial risk to access revolving capital. Amex, like Brex, will offer startups the option of full corporate liability without personal guarantees, by leaning on its access to these players' transactional data.\n\nCredit cards for startups have become a hot market for fintechs, and Amex's move is unlikely to change that for the likes of Brex and Divvy. These fintechs have been successful in the space because they've developed novel and innovative solutions.\n\nThere's no doubt that Amex's foray into the segment will offer a new and more substantial challenge for these players. After all, a firm that generates revenue of close to $40 billion annually has resources to significantly undercut these players.\n\nYet, the fact remains that Amex is simply copying their approach. So, more than simply being flattered by the imitation, these players should be galvanized further to action. Why? Because it's evidence of the biggest challenge incumbents face: Their inability to ideate innovative solutions to address pain points for customers on their own.\n\nTo move the innovation needle and avoid simply playing catch-up with fintechs, Amex needs to identify and solve new pain points. Its latest product makes no mention of providing spending insights and management tools for startups, for example.\n\nFeatures like that, in addition to solutions that can help its target market cut costs, such as fee-free transactions for transfers, can help the firm close the gap on its fintech peers. However, to go a step further and prevent itself from constantly being behind these fintechs, Amex needs to adjust its broader strategy and pinpoint startups' pain points that have yet to be widely addressed.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
