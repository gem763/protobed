Ken Barlow - will celebrate his 80th birthday.\n\nThe Coronation Street legend will mark the occasion with a right rollocking knees up in the only suitable venue - The Rovers Return.\n\nA cobbles stalwart since viewers first paid a visit to Corrie, Ken has been in the ITV show since its opening episode on December 9, 1960.\n\nBack then, he was the dashing and well-educated son of a working class family.\n\nDespite winning a place at Manchester University and then starting work as a roving reporter on the Weatherfield Gazette, Ken is soon just as famous for his wandering eye as for his journalism skills.\n\nHe was just a baby-faced 23 when he married his first wife, Valerie Tatlock.\n\nShe had moved to the cobbles in 1961 and was soon smitten with the Weatherfield lothario.\n\nYoung love definitely didn't run smoothly for this pair though as just two years into the marriage Ken had a fling with exotic dancer, Pip Mistral.\n\nValerie and Ken's marriage survives and the following year she gives birth to their twins, Peter and Susan.\n\nBut tragedy strikes the couple the night before they are due to emigrate to Jamaica, where Ken has accepted a teaching job.\n\nPoor Val is dies after suffering an electric shock caused by a faulty plug on her hairdryer when she tries to tighten it with a potato peeler.\n\nShe died instantly but as she fell to the floor Val knocked over a portable heater and the house went up in flames as Ken watched, heartbroken and helpless, outside.\n\nAfter the twins are sent to live with their grandparents in Scotland, Ken's affairs really start to pick up pace.\n\nOne of Ken's raciest love affairs was with An Fab star and national treasure, Joanna Lumley.\n\n(Image: Granada Television)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThe TV legend played Elaine Perkins and arrived on the cobbles in July, 1973.\n\nIt was just a eight episode storyline - but a very steamy one at that.\n\nKen even has a one night stand with fellow stalwart of the cobbles, Rita, but it's not long before he's marched up the aisle for a second time.\n\nDesperate for a mother figure for his twins, Ken ties the knot with Janet Reid.\n\nUnfortunately for him she had very different ideas and refuses to act as a mum to Ken's two children.\n\n(Image: Rex Features)\n\nThe couple split up in 1974, although Janet flits on and out of Ken's life for several years.\n\nFinally, in 1977 Janet begs Ken for one last chance and when he refuses takes her own life while lying in his bed.\n\nOnce again, Ken isn't single for long - this time after coming to the aid of a damsel in distress.\n\nDeirdre Langton is left almost destitute when her husband, Ray, walks out on her and their young daughter, Tracy.\n\nBut Ken is on hand to offer his support and the two eventually marry in 1981, and form one of the most iconic couples in all of soapland.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: Granada Television)\n\nTheir marriage soon hit a rocky patch when Deirdre embarked on an affair with factory boss, Mike Baldwin.\n\nThe love triangle - and subsquent fall-out - is one of the most dramatic ever seen on TV.\n\nKen struggles to forgive Deirdre and when he has his own affair with Wendy Crozier, the couple divorce in 1990.\n\nThe separation from his beloved Deirdre hits Ken hard and he tries to take his own life but pal Bet Lynch rushes to his aid and prevents him.\n\nOne relatonship that remains constant for Ken is his hatred and rivalry with Mike.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nWhen Ken's daughter, Susan, has a brief and ill-fated relationship with the factory boss, Ken is incensed.\n\nAnd once again, they find themselves competing for the same woman when Alma Sedgewick is dumped by Mike for Jackie Ingram and starts a relationship with Ken.\n\nBut when Mike's marriage to Jackie breaks down after just a week, it's clear he has been using her for her money and has even been sending some Alma's way.\n\nHeartbreakingly, Mike seduces Alma away from Ken on Christmas Day and once again the love lorn lothario is alone.\n\nBut not for long - this time he falls into the arms of hairdresser Denise Osbourne and the couple have a son, Daniel.\n\n(Image: Granada Television)\n\nShe agrees to become his fourth wife, but unbeknown to Ken is having an affair with her brother-in-law, Brian Dunkley.\n\nShe flees Weatherfield and dumps the baby boy she shares with Ken with his dad.\n\nKen, now a single dad, is adjusting to life with his son until Denise returns and dramatically snatches Daniel.\n\nThankfully, Ken can always count on one woman - his true love, Deirdre.\n\nThe couple finally reunite in 1999 and re-marry - Ken's fourth wedding - in 2005, despite Deirdre's fling with corner shop owner, Dev.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHowever, Ken's roving is far from over and by 2009 he has fallen in love outside the marriage with actress, Martha.\n\nThis time he even plans to leave the long suffering Deirdre but develops cold feet and returns home.\n\nThe couple vow to try to make their troubled marriage work.\n\nThen tragically, while visiting her friend Bev Unwin, Deirdre dies suddenly. Ken is utterly heartbroken.\n\nBut nothing can keep lover man Ken from pursuing the ladies and before long he's started a fling with Nessa Warner but once again, it's ill-fated and he ends up alone.\n\nHowever, Ken seems have found love with hairdresser Claudia Colby... for now.", "description": "The Coronation Street legend, played by William Roache, has lived on the cobbles since the first episode and is tonight celebrating his 80th birthday", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Granada Television", "Itv", "Rex Features", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18897873.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_ken_barlow.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
