The plot initially sounds a bit pedestrian: King John of England and the King of France battle for power, forge a tentative truce, and fight a whole lot more. But what a play this is: there are endless thrilling fights, spellbinding moments of reflection and devastating outpourings of grief. There is also a gradual erosion of belief in any sort of greater good as the divine right of kings and divinity itself fade away in the heat of battle.\n\nDesigner Max Johns has talked about approaching King John as a new play and the production tingles with a tangible sense of spontaneity. The show is loosely located in the mid 20th century but the set and costumes grow heavier and older \u2013 disco lights replaced with flickering candles \u2013 as the political squabbling turns deadly. There is jaunty dancing between the scenes, endless fashion parades (peaking with Katherine Pearce\u2019s gold-decked Cardinal) and the mother of all food fights.

The connection is amplified by the fact that King John is played, brilliantly, by a woman. Rosie Sheehy portrays the King as a preening peacock, always on show when in public. When John addresses the citizens of Angers and implores them to recognise England\u2019s authority, the crowd munches on popcorn, spectators to their own downfall.\n\nShakespeare's 'Brexit play': Josie Rourke on King John Read more\n\nAs John\u2019s power wanes, Rhode expertly emphasises the personal cost of politics. Charlotte Randle initially plays Constance as a crazed stage mum, but after her son is imprisoned she implodes with a grief that hollows out the theatre. John\u2019s garments grow ever more oppressive until they\u2019re eventually removed. All that pomp and ceremony melts away and the King is left in rags, vomiting blood in a rusty bathtub.
