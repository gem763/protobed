It was a bunch of straight white guys and Caroline Rhea, so I was just playing my role.\u201d\n\nAt one point during her set, when Seales was making jokes about the difference between white women and women who \u201chappen to be white,\u201d an older gentleman in the audience yelled out, \u201cI love white women!\u201d\n\nSeales reveals that she got a DM later in the night from a black woman who was sitting at his table. She wrote, \u201cThank you for being the voice in the room because oftentimes I am the only black person in the room and I don\u2019t feel like I get to have that voice.\u201d The woman said she knew the heckler was \u201cracist\u201d because when she sat down at the table, he asked her, \u201cAre you here from a prison release program?\u201d\n\nWhen I respond with shock, Seales tells me, \u201cWhite people, you don\u2019t understand what other white people are saying to us!\u201d\n\nA self-described \u201ctruth-teller,\u201d Seales imparts pearls of wisdom like this, acquired over an eclectic career that includes stints on Nickelodeon, MTV and Def Poetry (as her alter-ego Amanda Diva) in her new book Small Doses: Potent Truths for Everyday Use, which codifies on paper what she shares with listeners of her popular podcast\u2014also called Small Doses\u2014on a weekly basis.\n\nLike with her stand-up, Seales\u2019 target audience is fellow black women who are trying to make their way in a world primarily run by white men. \u201cI know for me, I would have appreciated this type of book,\u201d Seales says of her early days in show business, \u201cbecause it would have given me a little more peace in the process.\u201d As an artist, she spent so much time asking herself questions like, \u201cWill people like this? How do I get people to like this? Am I enough?\u201d\n\nShe may know she\u2019s \u201cnot for everyone,\u201d but she\u2019s no longer willing to compromise.\n\nHighlights from our conversation are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts, the Himalaya app or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nOn becoming celebrity tabloid fodder\n\n\u201cThe more visible you are, the more people there are that see you and the more opportunity there is for you to get rained on. So I think that I get really positive things that get written about me and I think I touch people in a lot of positive ways. But I also think there\u2019s a thirst for conflict in the current state of the world. And I have a demeanor that quenches that thirst. Anyone who knows me and anyone who reads this book will know that\u2019s why I absolutely detest fame. It\u2019s a byproduct of working hard in an industry that relies on visibility to enhance your clout, your access, your options. And the thing about fame and celebrity is that so much of it is out of your control. As a type-A personality, not being able to control a narrative or the way that you are perceived, is very disconcerting. And for me it was not a light switch flip to realize, you know you no longer have control of your narrative, right? I know you think you do because you have an Instagram, but that is incorrect.\u201d\n\nWhy she decided to start stand-up comedy in her thirties\n\n\u201cI was afraid to bomb but I wasn\u2019t afraid to try. Because I\u2019d been hosting for so long, not just on television but also live shows. So I\u2019m not necessarily shy about being on stage and engaging with a crowd. But it was a process to find my voice. I knew that I needed to get out of the music space, that it wasn\u2019t the space for me anymore, but I didn\u2019t know where to go next. I started just comparing different careers that I knew. So I looked at Chelsea Handler, Ellen [DeGeneres] and Chris Rock. I looked at their careers and was like, what do they have that I don\u2019t have? Because they have careers that I aspire to. And all of them had stand-up. And that was the one thing I didn\u2019t have that all of them had.\u201d\n\nOn the vibe at the \u2018Insecure\u2019 set after her Emmy after-party drama with Issa Rae\n\n\u201cThe beauty is that we\u2019re all professional people who have worked together for four seasons. And I think we all understand that there aren\u2019t even enough black shows for us to even let that scenario bleed over into what we\u2019re doing. So I\u2019m fortunate to be able to work with folks who understand that. And I think what a lot of people don\u2019t grasp is that when you\u2019re doing television and you\u2019re doing this work, you\u2019re still at work. We\u2019re friends on the show, but even on the show there are strained moments and ups and downs. So if you\u2019re on the set every day for 15 hours a day, there are going to be those things too. Things happen.\u201d\n\nOn confronting Caitlyn Jenner over her \u2018white privilege\u2019\n\n\u201cOne thing I know is that, for the most part, situations are happening in a multi-layered way. There\u2019s the surface and that\u2019s involving the two people that are there. But then there\u2019s also this other layer, which is how it\u2019s affecting the people who are witnessing it. And it\u2019s the people that are witnessing it in the immediate space and the people who are witnessing it on the outside looking in. What I\u2019m most proud of in that situation is that a number of people made it clear to me that them watching me choose to be honest in a space where politeness would have probably been the safer bet empowered them to feel like they had a voice in spaces where they would have been expected to also be polite. I\u2019m a truth-teller in any space. And I think that if I had asked certain people how I should have gone into that space, I think they would have said to play it cool. And I think if I had played it cool, I would have been playing myself.\u201d\n\nNext week on The Last Laugh podcast: Director, writer, producer, stand-up comedian and author of It\u2019s Garry Shandling\u2019s Book, Judd Apatow.", "description": "On this week\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Last Laugh,\u201d Amanda Seales opens up about tensions between the \u201cInsecure\u201d cast, confronting Caitlyn Jenner, and her new book.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572328887/191028-Wilstein-amanda-seales-tease_xljlth", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
