At this time, there is no indication that the product is counterfeit. Additionally, FDA is not aware of any records pointing to counterfeit Johnson's baby powder in the US market,\" Meyer's email said.\n\nJohnson & Johnson \"has immediately initiated a rigorous, thorough investigation into this matter, and is working with the FDA to determine the integrity of the tested sample, and the validity of the test results,\" the company said in its announcement.\n\nThe company \"has a rigorous testing standard in place to ensure its cosmetic talc is safe and years of testing, including the FDA's own testing on prior occasions -- and as recently as last month -- found no asbestos. Thousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos.\"\n\nThe FDA noted in its statement that it has been conducting an ongoing survey of cosmetic products for asbestos since 2018 and to date has tested about 50 cosmetic products.\n\nAs part of that testing, two samples of Johnson's Baby Powder were tested: one sample from lot #22318RB, which was found to be positive for asbestos, and a second from lot #00918RA, which tested negative for asbestos.\n\nThe agency said that it expects to issue the full results from this survey by the end of the year.\n\nTalc is an ingredient used in many cosmetic products, such as baby powder and blush. The FDA has been conducting ongoing research into the potential contamination of talc with asbestos.\n\n\"Both talc and asbestos are naturally occurring minerals that may be found in close proximity in the earth. Unlike talc, however, asbestos is a known carcinogen. There is the potential for contamination of talc with asbestos and therefore, it is important to select talc mining sites carefully and take steps to test the ore sufficiently,\" according to the FDA.\n\nJohnson & Johnson said in its Friday announcement that the \"company is acting out of an abundance of caution.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe company has faced previous allegations of asbestos contamination in its talcum powder.\n\nReuters report published last year said that the company was aware for decades of asbestos in its baby powder but did not disclose that information to the public.", "description": "Johnson & Johnson has announced that it's initiating a voluntary recall in the United States of a specific lot of its popular Johnson's Baby Powder due to low levels of asbestos contamination.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181214134937-03-johnsons-baby-powder-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
