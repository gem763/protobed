REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\nUighur rights advocate Tohti was jailed for life in China in 2014 on separatism charges that were widely denounced at the time in Western capitals.\n\nThe European Parliament chose him for his activity to foster dialogue between Chinese people and the mostly Muslim Uighur minority who live in China\u2019s western region of Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cThe parliament calls on the Chinese authorities to release him immediately,\u201d the assembly\u2019s president, David Sassoli, told lawmakers at a plenary sitting in Strasbourg, announcing the prize.\n\nThe move infuriated China.\n\n\u201cWe do not know about this prize you mention. What we do know is that Ilham is a criminal who was sentenced in accordance with the law by a Chinese court,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters.\n\nChina \u201chopes that all sides respect China\u2019s internal affairs and judicial sovereignty and not inflate the arrogance of terrorists\u201d.\n\nBeijing has rejected any criticism of its policies in Xinjiang, where the government has faced international opprobrium for placing up to a million Uighurs in what Beijing calls de-radicalisation facilities.\n\nTohti, an ethnic Uighur, has criticised the government for not giving Xinjiang and its Turkic-speaking Uighurs more autonomy, but had always sought to work inside the system.\n\nHe had taught at Beijing\u2019s Minzu University, which specialises in ethnic minority studies.\n\nChina has said Xinjiang faces a threat from Islamist militants and separatists.\n\nIt rejects all accusations of mistreatment and denies mass internment, saying it is simply seeking to end extremism and violence in Xinjiang through education, and that it is offering Uighurs better employment prospects with vocational training.\n\nThe EU parliament\u2019s prize, named after the late Russian dissident Andrei Sakharov, has been awarded annually since 1988 to honour individuals and organisations defending human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nLi Fangping, the lawyer who represented Tohti at his trial in 2014, told Reuters, he hoped the prize could give his former client some peace.\n\nBut he added: \u201cI think it will be very hard for him to learn of this news.\u201d\n\nPhil Bennion, a British Liberal Democrat member of the European parliament, said while lawmakers were happy he had won the prize, they also could not be sure he would get the news.\n\n\u201cHe has been in solitary confinement since his imprisonment in 2014, and for the last 2 years has been denied visiting rights by the Chinese authorities. Even his family has not seen him since 2017,\u201d he said.", "description": "The European Parliament awarded its annual prize for the defence of human rights on Thursday to jailed ethnic Uighur economics professor Ilham Tohti, angering Beijing which called him a criminal and a terrorist.", "authors": ["Francesco Guarascio", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444451302&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0SH", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
