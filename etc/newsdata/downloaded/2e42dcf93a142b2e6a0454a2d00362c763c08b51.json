After Congress expressly declined to give him that money, Mr. Trump signed into law \u2014 rather than vetoed \u2014 the legislation that denied him the funds he sought and then spent the money anyway.\n\nIt has also been asked with respect to his imposition of sales taxes \u2014 he calls them tariffs \u2014 on nearly all goods imported into the United States from China, taxes that only Congress can constitutionally authorize. And it has been asked in connection with the presidentially ordered mistreatment of families seeking asylum in the United States by separating parents from children \u2014 in defiance of a court order.\n\nThis question of presidential power is not an academic one. Nor is it a question unique to the Trump presidency, as it has risen numerous times before Mr. Trump entered office. But the audacious manner of Mr. Trump\u2019s employment of presidential powers has brought it to public scrutiny.\n\nHere is the backstory.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution was written in the aftermath of the American Revolution, a war fought against a kingdom, most of whose domestic subjects articulated that the king had been chosen by God to rule over them.\n\nThe colonists in America, prodded by radicals like Sam Adams, Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson, profoundly rejected that idea. They argued that each individual was sovereign and a repository of natural rights. Jefferson articulated as much in the Declaration of Independence.\n\nSo, when it came time to craft a new government here, the drafters of the Constitution, led by Jefferson\u2019s friend James Madison, made certain that there would be no king. Congress would write the laws. The president would enforce them. The judiciary would interpret them. This separation of powers is what the late Justice Antonin Scalia called the most unique and effective aspect of American government.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nFor starters, Madison feared the accumulation of too much power in any one branch of the government. With the exception of the uniqueness and violence of the Civil War, for 130 years, the branches remained within their confines. For that matter, the federal government did so as well.\n\nCongresses and presidents accepted the Madisonian view that the federal government could only do what the Constitution affirmatively authorized them to do, and all remaining governmental tasks would be addressed by the states. This, too, was part of Madison\u2019s genius in order to impede the concentration of too much power in the hands of too few.\n\nAll that changed when a former professor of constitutional law \u2014 who was not a lawyer \u2014 entered the White House. Woodrow Wilson believed and behaved as though Congress could legislate on any problem for which there was a national political will, except that which was expressly prohibited by the Constitution.\n\nThe Wilsonian view of government and the Madisonian view of government are polar opposites.\n\nAt the same time that Wilson was turning the Constitution on its head, he was also signing legislation that created the agencies of the administrative state. These agencies, he argued, should be filled with experts in their fields \u2014 the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, to name a few \u2014 because experts would bring better government.\n\nThe agencies were authorized to write regulations that have the power of law, to enforce those regulations and to interpret them. This slippage of constitutional authority to creatures alien to the Constitution \u2014 which branch of government are they in? \u2014 masked a parallel slippage of power from Congress to the presidency.\n\nJust as Wilson persuaded Congress that the feds needed experts to run parts of the government, he and his successors persuaded Congress that the presidency should be the repository of emergency powers.\n\nThe Constitution does not authorize any emergency powers; nevertheless, the War Powers Resolution lets the president fight any war for 90 days without congressional authorization, even though the Constitution makes clear that only Congress can declare war. Other national emergency statutes give presidents short-term near-dictatorial powers \u2014 like imposing taxes by calling them tariffs \u2014 without defining what is an emergency.\n\nScalia railed against all this \u2014 and the U.S. Supreme Court often struck down power transfers from Congress to the president. It did so not to preserve the institutional integrity of Congress but to uphold the principle of the separation of powers that Madison crafted as a bulwark against tyranny. The constitutional allocation of power among the branches is not for them to alter.\n\nIts equilibrium was intended to maintain tension and even jealousy among the branches \u2014 and thereby undergird personal liberty. Madison\u2019s articulated fear was \u201ca gradual concentration of the several powers in the same\u201d branch. Scalia called this gradual concentration of power in the presidency a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing that became a bare naked wolf.\n\nAfter years of faithless Congresses legally but unconstitutionally ceding power to the presidency, we have arrived where we are today \u2014 a president who spends unappropriated funds, raises taxes, defies courts and changes immigration laws on his own. I have written before that the Republicans who rejoice in this will weep over it when a Democrat is in the White House. No president should have unconstitutional powers.\n\nI have also written that the guarantees of the Constitution \u2014 separation of powers foremost among them \u2014 are only effective when the folks in whose hands we repose the Constitution for safekeeping are faithful to their oaths to uphold it.\n\nWhen they are, our freedoms flourish. When they aren\u2019t \u2014 power abhors a vacuum \u2014 the temptation of tyranny arises.\n\n\u2022 Andrew P.
