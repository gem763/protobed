So to lose Dev and Dianne was a real shock and there was general numbness really this had happened.\"\n\nDev and Diane were in the dance off with Emma Weymouth and Aljaz Skorjanec, who the judges voted to save\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nMany plan to boycott after a decision they claim was unjust.\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Dev said that he was \"absolutely gutted\" to be out so early.\n\nHe said: \"I\u2019m not going to lie I am absolutely gutted, but learning how to dance, hanging out with Dianne and the other pros and celebs\u2026 I\u2019ve absolutely loved it.\"\n\n*Strictly Come Dancing returns on Saturday 19th October at 6.40pm with the results show on Sunday 20th October at 7.15pm on BBC One", "description": "Mike, who is partnered with Katya Jones, explained that because the scores were so high last week no one was safe", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Bbc Guy Levy", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572615.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_19045603-high_res-strictly-come-dancing-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
