On Saturday night, riders were trapped in the air for over three hours after the Skyliner suddenly stopped. The aerial transportation system, which connects Epcot and Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios with four Disney World resorts, will be closed while Disney investigates what went wrong.\n\nPhotos and videos posted to social media show crews rescuing trapped guests from the gondolas, which reportedly travel 11 mph and at their highest hover 90 feet above the ground. The more than 300 cabins (each with a capacity for 10 passengers) which comprise the Skyliner system also, notably, do not have air conditioning.\n\nIn a release obtained by the Orlando Sentinel, Disney said, \u201cOne of the three Disney Skyliner routes experienced an unexpected downtime Saturday evening.\u201d On Sunday, Disney added that they were working with the trapped passengers to rectify their experiences.\n\nAaron Murray and his girlfriend Courtney Cole were two of the riders trapped on the gondolas Saturday night. Murray tells Yahoo Lifestyle that they got on at around 7:45 p.m. and didn\u2019t get off until well after 11 p.m.\n\n\u201cOur gondola got pretty lucky,\u201d Murray says of the eight passengers who were trapped together, noting that, while a few people were anxious all in all their group passed the time by joking around. \u201cWe had a good group.\u201d\n\nMurray adds that worry rose \u201cwhen they evacuated the gondola that was directly behind us and it took about 30 minutes.\u201d He claims that they saw one of the people in the gondola behind them being taken away on a stretcher.\n\n\u201cIt could have been a very, very long night,\u201d Murray notes, but says their gondola eventually made it back to the station which meant they didn\u2019t have to go through the lengthy in-air evacuation like the gondola behind them.\n\nMurray says \u201cit was kind of a weird feeling\u201d when they got off, describing what could be deemed as sea legs. The gondolas move in the breeze, so being sturdy on solid ground took a moment of readjustment. \u201cOur legs felt a little weird at first,\u201d Murray says. \u201cWe were just happy it didn\u2019t take as long as it might have.\u201d\n\nEvacuating two people at a time off of the Disney World Skyliner... could be very slow with 10 capacity gondolas.... #disneyskyliner #disneyworld @WDWToday pic.twitter.com/y5S1IJxhtP \u2014 Aaron Murray (@WaltyDis) October 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray also calls out a lack of useful communication from Disney itself while they were stuck. Dispatches from other gondola riders via social media echoed that criticism. Disney guest Katie Koehnen tweeted that stuck passengers were being encouraged to turn to social media for information.\n\nI think we are going to have to be evacuated by firetruck. It\u2019s been an hour and a half now. We\u2019ve been given no information this whole time. pic.twitter.com/ajZvDbPWze \u2014 Katie Koehnen (@katie_babylady) October 6, 2019\n\nSpent over 3 hours stuck on #disneyskyliner. We were given no information while stuck except find things by social media. \u2014 Katie Koehnen (@katie_babylady) October 6, 2019\n\nOther gondola riders tweeted images from inside the stalled Skyliner.\n\nThe people in our skyliner...waiting for our evacuation #disneyskyliner pic.twitter.com/HzQiLnNdD6 \u2014 Ashley Salamanca (@AshleyPatricia2) October 6, 2019\n\nThe gondola riders also tweeted images of the emergency supplies on board the Skyliner, which included bags of water for all on board.\n\nFinally notified that there is emergency kit with water and a notepad ??? under the bench. Unfortunately it was tied shut. Had to break into it. #skyliner pic.twitter.com/jelU9m7xF5 \u2014 Brad George (@Brad_George) October 6, 2019\n\nOne stuck passenger claimed that after a few hours in the air his mother, who was there with him, became sick.\n\nUpdate on this:\n\nStill no rescue yet, mother is getting sick throwing up, gave her one of the bags in the emergency kit. \u2014 RecoTheFolf (@RecoTheFolf) October 6, 2019\n\nPassengers say that once they were safely on the ground they were given gift cards and day passes from Disney. Murray and his girlfriend, who are pass holders, are hoping to be able to put what they received from Disney towards next year\u2019s passes.", "description": "Disney World guests spent three hours trapped in the air on the newly launched Skyliner transportation system.", "authors": ["Elena Sheppard"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SMbYldkR5iYW8t0ln3KM5w--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/7ab9b9c0-e85f-11e9-bc75-565e277a8226", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
