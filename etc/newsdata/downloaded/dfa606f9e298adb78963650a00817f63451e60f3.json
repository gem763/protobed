The Justice Department said Trump never communicated this request directly to Barr.\n\nThe whistleblower said about a dozen White House officials were on the president's July 25 call and that White House officials later intervened to \"lock down\" records of the call.\n\nAn intelligence community watchdog received the initial whistleblower complaint, conducted his own review and deemed it both \"urgent\" and credible, triggering a legal requirement that it be transmitted to Congress.\n\nIn a letter to the House Intelligence Committee, Inspector General Michael Atkinson, said his preliminary review of the matter supported the whistleblower's core complaint \u2014 that Trump exerted pressure on a foreign leader to influence to the 2020 election. Atkinson said the whistleblower had an \"arguable\" political bias, but he said he still viewed the complaint as credible in part because of other information he obtained.\n\nBut Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, diverted the complaint to the Justice Department, which determined it was potentially privileged and not in the jurisdiction of the intelligence community.\n\nRep. Will Hurd (R-Texas), a former CIA officer, tweeted \u201cthere is a lot in the whistleblower complaint that is concerning. We need to fully investigate all of the allegations addressed in the letter, and the first step is to talk to the whistleblower.\u201d\n\nThe complaint is all but certain to fuel House Democrats' accelerating efforts to bring articles of impeachment against Trump. Speaker Nancy Pelosi threw her support behind a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday and as details of the whistleblower complaint emerged, Democrats became increasingly resolved to expedite the effort.\n\nDefenders of the president have already seized on reports that the whistleblower was not an eyewitness to the events described in the complaint. In the version released by Congress, the whistleblower acknowledges this but says the events were corroborated by more than half a dozen officials.", "description": "The unnamed individual also claimed White House officials were 'deeply disturbed' by Trump's push for a Biden probe.", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4j8yQ.MgQiF6p0ROcL2j2w--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/3b2b825660a0d65339ce1b05776639f6", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
