The claims came from a whistleblower,\n\n\"Here's what I know. I know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question. Why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader, if that's what happened? It appears that's what happened,\" Biden told Doocy. \"You should be looking at Trump.\"\n\n\"Trump is doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum and he's using the abuses of power and every element of the presidency to try and smear me. Everybody's looked at it and said nothing is there,\" Biden told other reporters and cameras.\n\n\"Ask the right question,\" Biden told Doocy.\n\nEight. That\u2019s how many times Donald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate me and my family.\n\n\n\nWhy? Because he knows I'll beat him like a drum. pic.twitter.com/Oc303alcBi \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 21, 2019\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Sunday called on the Department of Justice to investigate Vice President Biden's connections to Ukraine. He said he believes a thorough investigation should take place, seeing as how the Democrats treated Preside Donald Trump and the Russia probe.", "description": "Whoa..09/22/2019 19:09:49PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/3b1cd4b5-63bc-475a-8130-9f3205274dd8.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
