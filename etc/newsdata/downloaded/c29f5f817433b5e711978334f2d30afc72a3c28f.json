I\u2019m looking to go to Tenerife on a package holiday next spring, but have heard that the closure of Thomas Cook will increase the prices of package holidays at other companies. Is this true?\n\nJan McDonald, Sussex.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse, flight prices offered by Jet2.com and Ryanair rose significantly\n\nA. Yes, package prices will probably rise \u2014 it\u2019s a simple matter of supply and demand. Even in the immediate aftermath of Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse, flight prices offered by Jet2.com and Ryanair rose significantly (as did those firm\u2019s share values). In the long run it seems likely package holiday prices in general will go up.\n\nQ. We booked a package holiday in Corfu with Jetline Holidays departing on October 7, but our Thomas Cook Airlines flights have been cancelled. The flights are ATOL protected. Can we obtain a refund for the whole holiday?\n\nMrs Patricia Herbert, via email.\n\nA. You should receive a full refund via ATOL, the Air Travel Organiser\u2019s Licence, a fund operated by the government-run Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).\n\nOn Monday, the CAA will launch a service for all Thomas Cook-related refunds. Payments will be made within two months of receipt of completed claims forms (thomascook.caa.co.uk).\n\nQ. I booked a three-week, ATOL-covered Thomas Cook holiday for travel in January using a credit card. Should I claim from ATOL or my credit card company?\n\nSusan McLoughlin, Liverpool.\n\nOn Monday, the CAA will launch a service for all Thomas Cook-related refunds\n\nA. Claim via either, although it may be quicker via your credit card. As well as being covered by ATOL, your credit card company \u2014 under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act \u2014 provides cover, too.\n\nWe're here to help\n\nIf you need advice, the Holiday Guru is here to answer your questions.
