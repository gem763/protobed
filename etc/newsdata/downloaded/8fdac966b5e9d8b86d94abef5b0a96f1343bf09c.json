Below, read Dan Pfeiffer\u2019s May article on how Democrats should wage this fight\u2014and win.\n\nDespite the protestations from Democratic Leaders and handwringing from pundits and consultants, it seems like House Democrats will vote for an impeachment inquiry sooner rather than later. The moral and constitutional arguments for impeachment are much stronger than \u201cYes, Trump committed crimes, but we can\u2019t impeach him because politics or something.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Democrats need a plan to manage the politics and maximize the spotlight of an impeachment inquiry. Impeachment is undoubtedly the politically riskier path, but also the one with greater upside for the country and the party. If Democrats are united behind a smart strategy, they can use an impeachment inquiry to prosecute a devastating case against Trump that increases the likelihood that Democrats win the White House, expand our House Majority, and take the Senate.\n\nFirst, Democrats need a message. They need a concise and compelling argument for what Trump did wrong, how his misdeeds connect to the lives and concerns of voters, and why this merits the extraordinary response of impeachment.\n\nMy suggestion for that message is:\n\nDonald Trump has abused his power to hide multiple crimes and massive corruption. He has used the Presidency to punish his enemies, reward his friends, and enrich himself at the expense of the American people. No one is above the law, not even a rich politician.\n\nThis narrative (or one like it) needs to be repeated over and over again by every Democratic Member of Congress and talking head. The Democratic SuperPACs should run ads. The grassroots organizations should be delivering this message at the door, on the phone, and in townhalls. The Democratic presidential candidates should make it part of their message. No voter should be confused about why this is happening and what is at stake.\n\nSecond, the impeachment inquiry should be broader than the crimes outlined in the Mueller report. A narrow focus on Trump\u2019s obstruction of the Russia investigation makes it easier for the Republicans to accuse Democrats of trying to relitigate 2016, and deprives Democrats the opportunity to introduce evidence of additional impeachable offenses that Trump has committed since taking office. An impeachment inquiry should look broadly at Trump\u2019s abuse of power: his politicization of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies, his refusal to protect our elections and our country from foreign sabotage, and the rampant corruption in an administration where everyone from the president on down enrich themselves at the expense of American taxpayers and America\u2019s security.\n\nThird, an impeachment inquiry should be plotted out more like a TV show than a trial. The star witnesses and high-profile hearings should be spaced out and timed for maximum impact. They should tell a story about Trump\u2019s misdeeds. There should be no rush to get this over with quickly or to meet some artificial timeline. The audience for this show is not the Senate. It\u2019s not Twitter and it\u2019s not the panel on Morning Joe. The audience is the American people \u2013 specifically the new and sporadic Democratic voters who came out in 2018, or the independents and Republicans who say they\u2019re most concerned about Trump\u2019s conduct. Our job is to persuade them, not the DC pundit class.\n\nFourth, turn the relative unpopularity of impeachment into an asset. The polls are clear that impeachment is unpopular. Majorities oppose it. While that fact may change over time, Democrats should make a virtue of the fact that they\u2019re taking a principled position out of conviction, not calculation or convenience.\n\nFifth, use Senate Republicans as a foil. Mitch McConnell has already indicated that no matter what crimes Trump may have committed, he will do everything in his power to ensure that the president escapes accountability. Democrats should view this as an opportunity to pressure Republican Senators who are vulnerable in 2020. If Cory Gardner or Susan Collins or Martha McSally refuse to hold Trump accountable, paint them as Trump flunkies who put party over country. Every one of them is aiding and abetting the president\u2019s corruption and criminality.\n\nFinally, Democrats must show the public that they can walk and chew gum at the same time. At Trump\u2019s unhinged statement in the Rose Garden last week, he previewed his response to impeachment. Trump wants to run against the \u201cInvestigate Everything, Do Nothing\u201d Congress. Democrats should rob this argument of its political potency by laying out a detailed legislative agenda that focuses on the kitchen table issues that matter most to voters. Pass these bills in the House, and then hold public events demanding that McConnell give them a vote in the Senate. None of these bills will become law, but they\u2019ll give Democrats a platform to run on, as well as a response to Republican attacks and media handwringing.\n\nThere is no question whether impeachment is the right vote, only if it\u2019s the right politics. I can\u2019t tell you how the politics of impeachment will play out \u2013 no one can. But through impeachment proceedings, Democrats have the power to shape the debate, grab the microphone away from Trump, and tell a compelling story about why he\u2019s unfit to be president. The political risk is real, but so is the potential upside \u2013 if done well. No matter what Democrats do, Trump and Bill Barr will be falsely accusing Democrats of treason and spinning absurd conspiracy theories about the origins of the Mueller investigation. A well-planned and well-executed impeachment inquiry may be the only way to wrest the microphone from Trump and tell a story on our terms about who Trump is and the damage he has wrought on our country.", "description": "", "authors": ["Dan Pfeiffer"], "top_image": "https://crooked.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/democrats_impeachment_strategy_social.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
