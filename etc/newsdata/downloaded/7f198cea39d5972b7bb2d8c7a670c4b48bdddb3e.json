This week Democrats jettisoned all that in favor of the only issue that implicates their own front-runner for the nomination. Genius.\n\nThe one person who has been as much in the news this week as Donald Trump is former Vice President Joe Biden. It\u2019s a dubious accomplishment. The only way to discuss Mr. Trump\u2019s nonsmoking-gun phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is to acknowledge the subject of the ruckus: Mr. Biden\u2019s glaring conflicts of interest during his vice presidency vis-\u00e0-vis his son Hunter\u2019s business interests.
