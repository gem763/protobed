Mandatory Credit: Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo\n\nVerlander allowed four runs on seven hits and three walks over six innings in a Game 2 loss last Wednesday that gave the Washington Nationals a 2-0 lead in Major League Baseball\u2019s best-of-seven championship series.\n\nThe Astros have since roared back, taking the next three games in Washington, giving Houston two chances at home to secure their second championship in three seasons. It will be Verlander who tries to seal the deal in Game 6 while seeking his first career win in a World Series.\n\n\u201cThat would obviously be a moment that would be - that I would cherish in my career if that were able to happen,\u201d Verlander said on Sunday ahead of Houston\u2019s Game 5 win.\n\nThe right-handed veteran has been everything the Astros had hoped for when they acquired him from the Detroit Tigers in 2017. But despite being a picture of durability in the regular season, he has come up short when it matters most.\n\nOn the same night last week when Verlander became MLB\u2019s all-time leader in postseason strikeouts, the 36-year-old also added his name to the record books as the first pitcher to lose his first five World Series decisions.\n\nGetting that first win will be all the more difficult given Verlander, part of Houston\u2019s 2017 World Series championship pitching staff, will be up against batters who have already faced his pitches in this series and should have a better feel for them.\n\n\u201cIt becomes more difficult,\u201d Verlander said of facing an opponent twice in one series. \u201cOnce they\u2019ve seen you three, four at-bats, it\u2019s a little bit easier for them to make adjustments, and having seen your off-speed stuff and tracked it.\n\n\u201cYou just need to execute a little bit better.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals also will be desperately trying to stave off elimination and force a Game 7 as they aim for the first World Series title in franchise history.\n\nVerlander, an eight-time All-Star and former Cy Young Award winner as the American League\u2019s best pitcher, has all the confidence of his teammates going into the Game 6 clash.\n\nGerrit Cole, who was dominant on the mound for the Astros during a 7-1 win on Sunday, said it will be business as usual for Verlander when the series resumes in Houston.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s ready for this moment,\u201d said Cole. \u201cWe\u2019ve been communicating back and forth throughout the whole series on how we were going to make an adjustment to what we were seeing and how we were going to attack.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to set the tone for us,\u201d Cole said. \u201cHopefully we can back him up with some runs, and play some great D (defense).\u201d", "description": "Houston Astros ace Justin Verlander has fallen short of his lofty standards on baseball's biggest stage but can change that narrative when he pitches in a potential World Series clincher on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445939689&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1HT-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
