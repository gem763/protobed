As I\u2019m writing this, there\u2019s a conspicuous absence from the big three: Fortnite. And its absence may be because two key streamers aren\u2019t on Twitch.\n\nAccording to the metrics site Twitch Tracker, Fortnite dropped from pole position, where it had been holding steady for months, and has lately been hovering somewhere around third or fourth. Right now, in the early afternoon on a Tuesday, the top three games on Twitch are World of Warcraft: Classic, League of Legends, and Just Chatting (a category that generally features people talking to their viewers directly).\n\nSo where\u2019s Fortnite? It\u2019s free and available on every console. It\u2019s also constantly updated, which leaves its developers crunched and keeps its players returning for a fresh hit of the same old drug. On its face there\u2019s no real reason Fortnite should fall in Twitch\u2019s rankings, or become any less generally popular than it has been \u2014 barring, of course, new releases like World of Warcraft: Classic. (In gaming, as in life, novelty counts.) That\u2019s why it\u2019s such a drastic example of how influential its streamers are.\n\nIn the last month, Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins, widely held to be the most popular gamer in the world, traded Twitch for an exclusive deal with Microsoft\u2019s streaming platform Mixer and an undisclosed amount of money. Last week, Turner \u201cTfue\u201d Tenney took a break from streaming, which he announced in a series of late-night tweets where he declared that though he had everything he wanted, he still wasn\u2019t happy. Before Blevins left Twitch, he had 14 million followers on the platform, which made his the most followed account; on any given day he\u2019d command tens of thousands viewers at the same time. (On the last day he streamed on Twitch, he was live for nearly 7 hours, averaged 48,074 concurrent viewers, and gained 2,035 followers an hour.) Tenney, who has around 7 million followers, reaches similar numbers of people. (In his last broadcast, he averaged 32,436 concurrents.) Because Ninja and Tfue left, in other words, Fortnite fell out of the top spot on Twitch.\n\nStreamers don\u2019t make games, but games do make streamers. Blevins wouldn\u2019t be the globally famous Ninja without Fortnite; he was one of the early adopters of the game\u2019s battle royale mode and began to stream that on Twitch, which meant that anyone searching for streamers playing the game would see his stream.\n\nOther large streamers have similar right place, right time stories. Over time the Fortnite Twitch community grew larger, and its stars became names on first the platform, then the wider world \u2014 with all the brand deals and sponsorships that entails. When you\u2019re a larger performer, however, your incentives necessarily change; quality of life becomes more important than being live, and burnout becomes a bigger risk. You might be tired of Fortnite, or the game you play that made you internet famous.\n\nBut if you\u2019re big enough, when you take a break it can change the dynamics of an entire site. The audience is there for you, not the game. It\u2019s why big Fornite streamers like Timothy \u201cTimtheTatman\u201d Betar and Benjamin \u201cDrLupo\u201d Lupo \u2014 who have 4 million and 3.5 million followers, respectively \u2014 can switch over to a game like World of Warcraft: Classic and not totally lose the huge audiences who like to watch them in the first place. And this is where the calculation changes somewhat. Even if a bunch of streamers decided to quit playing Fortnite, either out of boredom or a sense of protest \u2014 Blevins joked about it on stream last month, in fact \u2014 it would remain the most popular game in the world. It\u2019s fun! People will play it regardless of who\u2019s streaming it. Other, smaller games, though, might not be quite as robust. Games disappear all the time; there\u2019s more choice than ever.\n\nThis feels particular to livestreaming. YouTube, for example, isn\u2019t overly concerned with timeliness because its videos aren\u2019t consumed as they\u2019re being made, which means they more or less gain views regardless of whether anything new is uploaded to the channel.\n\nFor streamers, however, the calculation is a bit different. If they\u2019re not streaming something, they\u2019re losing followers, subscribers, and potential viewers, who may not return later; keeping a consistent broadcast schedule is clutch. But then again: there\u2019s always people willing to step into a vacancy. Kyle \u201cBugha\u201d Giersdorf, for example, the 16-year-old from Pennsylvania who won this year\u2019s solo Fortnite World Cup has been gaining followers. In the months leading up to the event, which took place this summer, Giersdorf was averaging 40 to 60 concurrent viewers. Last month, he averaged 20,000.\n\nFortnite is still the most popular game in the world, and it\u2019s hard to see that changing anytime soon \u2014 whether or not big streamers get tired of it, and whether or not it\u2019s the most popular game on Twitch. There are other metrics that matter. But Twitch rankings are the most visible, quantified measure of how popular a game is. There\u2019s a lot to be said for being on top.", "description": "Before Ninja left Twitch, he had 14 million followers on the platform, which made his the most followed account; on any given day he\u2019d command tens of thousands viewers at the same time.
