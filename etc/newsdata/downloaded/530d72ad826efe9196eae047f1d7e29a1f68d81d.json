With this, Kate Watts, the founder of Faire Design and former U.S. president of the global agency Huge, becomes president of Atlantic 57.\n\nAtlantic 57 is a top agency for organizations looking to grow through periods of digital transformation. This acquisition, The Atlantic\u2019s first, moves to expand Atlantic 57\u2019s capabilities and leadership in brand services: infusing Faire Design\u2019s obsession with experience design, product and tech with Atlantic 57\u2019s expertise in research, editorial, and strategic planning.\n\n\u201cOur clients are constantly looking to us for more expertise on how to transform themselves, while staying true to their purpose and their brand,\u201d said Hayley Romer, publisher and CRO of The Atlantic. \u201cBy bringing on Kate and her team at this critical moment in our brand\u2019s history, we\u2019re strengthening our ability to deliver creative strategy and digital execution for our clients, making Atlantic 57 unmatched in the marketplace.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always been a massive fan of The Atlantic. It is arguably one of the most progressive, yet enduring brands,\u201d said Watts. \u201cAtlantic 57 will continue to build upon that legacy by defining a new client services category\u2014one that challenges existing publisher, agency, consulting and studio models. I am thrilled to join the exceptionally talented Atlantic 57 team to design that future together.\u201d", "description": "Faire Design founder Kate Watts named president of Atlantic 57, under publisher and CRO Hayley Romer", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/KateWatts2_copy/facebook.jpg?1568122185", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
