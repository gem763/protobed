McGhee\u2019s bill to allow college athletes to profit from their fame gets Gov DeSantis\u2019 endorsement. It prohibits enforcement of NCAA ban James Call, Democrat Capitol Reporter\n\nWe live in an age of gigantic coaching salaries and nine-figure athletic department budgets.\n\nSoon, we may be living in an age where college athletes have the ability to be compensated for their star power. Regardless of your feelings toward the NCAA, that's a positive development.\n\nBut the decision Tuesday by the NCAA's Board of Governors was light on details regarding how college athletes will be paid for their name, image and likeness in the future.\n\nThe NCAA sent a release that was short on specifics for how this works. But of those statements that were included, let\u2019s try to discern what this actually means:\n\nNCAA bullet point No. 1: Maintain priority education.\n\nWhat that may mean: This seems pretty straightforward. Calling in sick for a class won\u2019t cut it after an all-day autograph session. You still have to meet eligibility standards.\n\nBullet point No. 2: Ensure rules are transparent.\n\nWhat that may mean: Absolutely, and carry this a step further in having scholarship athletes disclose with whom they\u2019re financially aligned.\n\nBullet point No. 3: Maintain clear distinction between collegiate and pro opportunities.\n\nWhat that may mean: This isn\u2019t \"pay to play.\" Schools won\u2019t be the ones shelling out dough to athletes. Outside vendors and companies will.\n\nBullet point No. 4: Compensation for performance is impermissible.\n\nWhat that may mean: Jackpot. This is the gambling clause. No $100 handshakes allowed for shaving a point in a world where more states are legalizing sports wagering.\n\nBullet point No. 5: Protect the recruiting environment.\n\nWhat that may mean: The NCAA doesn't want bidding among schools. No \u201cwe\u2019ve got more endorsement opportunities than they do\u201d bargaining. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve already seen what havoc influential shoe companies can cause in basketball. (Of course, you\u2019d imagine recruits will have a pretty good idea of which school\u2019s boosters pony up the most. I guess you have to say this, but this doesn\u2019t seem realistic in prevention.)\n\nSEISMIC SHIFT?The effects of name, image, likeness changes on recruiting\n\nBullet point No. 6: Prohibit inducements to select, remain at or transfer to a specific institution.\n\nWhat that may mean: I\u2019m guessing that transferring from one school to another will be a lot tougher.\n\nAgain, what the NCAA did Tuesday is a positive step. It's a small step. And yes, there are still many questions.\n\nSome immediately on my mind \u2026\n\nWho represents endorsement-seeking athletes? It won\u2019t be the schools. Do agents creep into the situation?\n\nHow is it determined what sort of cut athletes receive from apparel sales and video games? Can they develop a players' association to argue on their behalf for their percentage? Some of the language in the Board of Governors\u2019 statement Tuesday suggests this may be something the NCAA fights against.\n\nIf star athletes are approached by apparel companies for major endorsement deals, are they allowed to sign with any shoe company? Or just the one that their university has a deal with?\n\nAt the moment, few details are known. But be reasonable: This is the first step toward a massive change in college athletics.\n\nIf the NCAA has learned one thing from its past stumbles, however, it should be this: Scoot over and let college athletes have a seat at the table.", "description": "The NCAA\u2019s Board of Governors suggested it was open to letting college athletes make money.
