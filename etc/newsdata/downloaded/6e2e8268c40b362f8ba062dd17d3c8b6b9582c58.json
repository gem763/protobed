And in a Twitter post last week, the travel TV host and tour operator announced his new \u201cself-imposed carbon tax\u201d meant to offset the environmental impact of bringing people to Europe every year.\n\nOur tour company takes 30,000 people to Europe every year.\n\n\n\nWe think we should pay for the impact all those flights have on our environment \u2014 and until our government requires us to do so, we\u2019re doing so voluntarily: https://t.co/KbNijPRaNT pic.twitter.com/kFxMqlr6Ge\n\n\n\n\u2014 Rick Steves (@RickSteves) October 2, 2019\n\nTourism is responsible for about eight percent of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, according to a study from Carbon Brief released last year. With the double-whammy of falling airfare and a growing global middle class, the rate of international vacationers in increasing by three to five percent every year.\n\nThe Rick Steves travel company announced its plans \u201cto pay our fair share of the environmental cost that our travelers incur, and to do so in a way that empowers communities throughout the developing world.\u201d\n\nThe recommended carbon offset for a roundtrip flight to Europe is $30. Because Rick Steves Europe takes approximately 30,000 travelers to the continent every year, that would add up to $900,000 in annual offsets. The company is rounding up to an even $1 million, with the money going to \u201ccarefully selected nonprofits that fight climate change through government advocacy and on-the-ground work,\u201d as opposed to offset programs.\n\nSteves recently explained this choice in an interview with Quartz. \u201cRather than buy carbon offsets (which is a fine thing to do), with this program, I get to enjoy a kind of philanthropic twofer by helping farmers in the developing world have better lives while employing climate-smart agriculture and forestry techniques,\u201d Steves said in the interview. \u201cWe look forward to reviewing and reassessing the list of organizations we are supporting each year.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Delta Air Lines bought carbon offsets to cover 300,000 people who flew the airline on Earth Day.", "description": "Rick Steves feels bad about the impact his\u00a0travel company has on the environment \u2014 so he's imposing a \"tax\" to offset the environmental impact.", "authors": ["Cailey Rizzo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OB6hQ5faEduPyoicYXNyrQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/travel.travelleisure.com/d9a3c924fbaff84310261c8971d8d0a8", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
