And I must say what is going on right now in Washington is completely unlike either of those processes.\n\n\u201cThis process is quite different,\u201d Mr. Stone said. \u201cI think that those who sit back and say, \u2018Well, the House may impeach the president but surely the Republican Senate will never convict him,\u2019 are being naive.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats launched impeachment proceedings last month over revelations involving Mr. Trump asking the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe Senate will be tasked with deciding whether to convict Mr. Trump if and when the House votes to impeach, likely putting the president\u2019s fate in the hands of fellow Republicans.\n\nMr. Stone said Mr. Trump is in for an \u201cincredible fight\u201d in going up against the impeachment proceedings, however, suggesting that some Republicans in the Senate may start leaning to convict.\n\n\u201cI would begin utilizing that money to advertise both digitally and on radio and on broadcast media in those states where there are Republican senators who may be thinking about joining this lynch mob,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as long as the president remains more popular in those states than those individual senators, they will be loathe to cast a vote against the president, particularly based on the thinnest reed that we have seen so far.\n\n\u201cMy message to the president is take this very seriously,\u201d Mr. Stone said about impeachment during the interview. \u201cStay very focused on those states with wobbly Republican senators. That is where this fight will be won or lost.\u201d\n\nMr. Stone was arrested in January and charged with obstruction, perjury and witness tampering in connection with allegedly interfering in efforts to investigate Russian involvement in the 2016 election. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts, and his trial is currently slated to start in D.C. on Nov. 5.\n\nSpeaking to Mr. Jones, Mr. Stone disclosed plans he has in place for soon after the trial is set to start. Mr. Stone said he will release a book next month about Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, a Democrat seeking the party\u2019s nomination to run against Mr. Trump next year.\n\nMr. Stone said the book, \u201cSpartacus,\u201d will be published in late November and will prove Mr. Booker\u2019s \u201cincredible corruption.\u201d\n\nMr. Booker\u2019s election campaign did not immediately return a message requesting comment.\n\nThe judge presiding over Mr. Stone\u2019s criminal trial barred him months ago from making any public statements about his case or the special counsel\u2019s investigation into the 2016 election that resulted in him facing charges. Mr. Stone subsequently posted about the judge on Instagram, resulting in the court banning him from posting to \u201cany form of social media\u201d pending future proceedings.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
