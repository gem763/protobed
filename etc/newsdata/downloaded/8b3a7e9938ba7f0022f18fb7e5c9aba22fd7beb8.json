We have a ways to go,\u201d Chicago Teachers Union President Jesse Sharkey said during a union news conference. \u201cWe actually want to see improvement on all the issues we are talking about here.\u201d\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot said she was disappointed by the union\u2019s decision to strike.\n\n\u201cWe are offering a historic package on the core issues \u2014 salary, staffing and class size,\u201d she said Wednesday night at her own news conference, adding that school district negotiators will remain at the bargaining table and that she hopes the union does, too.\n\nDuring the 2012 strike, the district kept some schools open for half days during a seven-day walkout. District officials said this time they will keep all buildings open during school hours, staffed by principals and employees who usually work in administrative roles.\n\nBreakfast and lunch will be served, but all after-school activities and school buses are suspended in the district serving more than 300,000 students.\n\nJanice Jackson, the district\u2019s CEO, encouraged parents to send their children to the school that they normally attend, however they will be welcome in any district schools.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put together a really comprehensive plan for the students,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe will make sure they are safe and they have a productive day.\u201d\n\nAlso striking will be 7,000 support staffers, whose union also failed to reach a contract agreement.\n\nBefore the strike announcement, June Davis said if teachers walked out, she would likely send her 7-year-old son, Joshua, to his usual elementary school \u2014 Smyth Elementary on the city\u2019s South Side where almost all students are low-income and minority.\n\nDavis, 38, said she would otherwise have to take her son to his grandmother\u2019s in a southern suburb, requiring an hourlong trip on a regional bus line.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s hoping they will come to some kind of agreement, find some compromise,\u201d Davis said.\n\nLightfoot preemptively announced that classes on Thursday would be canceled, saying she wanted to give parents more time to plan. A clearly frustrated Lightfoot said the city had not only offered a 16% pay raise over the five-year contract, but the city also had agreed to put language in the contract addressing \u201cenforceable targets\u201d on class size and increasing staffing levels for positions such as nurses, librarians and social workers \u2014 items the union said were critical.\n\nShe said the union\u2019s demands would cost an unaffordable $2.5 billion per year.\n\nUnion leaders disputed Lightfoot\u2019s characterization of the city\u2019s willingness to concede to their demands on several issues, including class sizes.\n\n\u201cCPS\u2019 current class size offer falls far short of what\u2019s needed to address the sweeping scale of the problem,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nLightfoot said the city agreed to make substantial changes on some of the union\u2019s top priorities, but its negotiators responded by issuing additional demands, including some she deemed unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThe union is still demanding to shorten instructional time by 30 minutes in the morning,\u201d she said. \u201cWe won\u2019t do that. We will not cheat our children out of instructional time.\u201d\n\nBefore heading into a downtown law firm for bargaining talks Wednesday morning, union vice president Stacy Davis Gates said there is a \u201cgross disconnect\u201d between Lightfoot\u2019s comments and what negotiators have put in writing.\n\n\u201cTo say that you have offered a proposal that respects what we are asking for, to say you\u2019ve bent over backward \u2026 it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous,\u201d Davis Gates said.\n\nCommunity organizations have been preparing for days to welcome students, ranging from a $100 per day camp for elementary school kids at the Shedd Aquarium to all-day programs run by the Boys & Girls Club of Chicago and accessible for a $20 annual membership fee.\n\nMimi LeClair, president of the Boys & Girls Club of Chicago, said a strike is particularly difficult for single parents and those whose jobs have inflexible schedules.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrendous dilemma, deciding between likely losing their job or having their paycheck docked when they rely on every penny or leaving their children home alone,\u201d LeClair said.\n\nThe city\u2019s public libraries also are planning programs for students, along with a network of churches and community centers that are part of the city\u2019s Safe Haven program intended to give kids a safe place during the summer months particularly on the city\u2019s South and West sides.\n\nThe YMCA of Metro Chicago expects highest demand for its all-day programs for children between the ages of 5 and 12, who are too young to stay home alone but whose parents may oppose sending them to schools unstaffed by teachers.\n\n\u201cReal life still happens,\u201d said Man-Yee Lee, a spokeswoman for the organization. \u201cParents still need to go to work and their kids still need somewhere to go.\u201d", "description": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Chicago parents and community groups are scrambling to prepare for a massive teachers' strike set to begin Thursday, prompting the city to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/358a3f_chicago-schools-strike-05568-members-chicago-teachers-union-house-delegates-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
