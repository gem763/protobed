Fans have theories", "language": "en", "text": "Naomi Watts was set to star on the prequel (Picture: Getty, HBO)\n\nGame Of Thrones fans are still reeling from the fact there won\u2019t be a prequel \u2013 and there are so many questions that need answering.\n\nHBO is yet to comment on why they have cancelled the prequel starring Naomi Watts, but fear not as GOT fans already have their own theories.\n\nThe spin-off from Jane Goldman and George RR Martin was set thousands of years before the original fantasy series, which featured the likes of Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington.\n\nThe scrapped project, named Bloodmoon, had been given the go-ahead last year and shooting for the first episode kicked off in Northern Ireland in June.\n\nNaomi was at the helm of the new show, with the likes of John Simm, Josh Whiteman, Miranda Richardson and Marquis Rodriguez also on the bill.\n\nThere have been many theories based on why it has been cancelled but one rumour that has been doing the rounds was that producers had trouble filming in certain locations in Ireland.\n\nThe Game Of Thrones prequel is no more (Picture: Rex)\n\nFans have weighed in with their own theories(Picture: Helen Sloan/HBO)\n\nAlthough eagle-eyed fans on Reddit have come up with their own reasons behind the shocking news \u2013 and some just can\u2019t get over it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne hard-core fan has come up with a theory that could change the entire series of Game Of Thrones as he believes the entire plot could be \u2018false\u2019.\n\nHe posted: \u2018Taking place thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones, the series chronicles the world\u2019s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros\u2019s history to the true origin of the White Walkers, the mysteries of the East, to the Stark of legend\u2026it\u2019s not the story we think we know. \u2018\n\n\u2018That the story shown on the show was literally false? That someone at HBO received the prompt from Martin with the whole WW background? Or that the story is true but simplified, and therefore in the prequel, they should have shown us the whole story?\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nOthers have come up with the theory that season 8 was so bad that show bosses went back in time and deleted the prequel.\n\nAnd one went as far to comment that HBO should start a sequel to \u2018wash away the memory\u2019 of season 8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne posted to Reddit: \u2018That last season of GOT, IMO, ruined any prequel ideas. I say they should start on a sequel to wash away the memory of that heaping pile of trash known as season 8 AND then go back to the prequels.\u2019\n\nMore GOT fans have toyed with the idea that producers wanted to keep the prequel a secret while some people are calling for them to make more seasons opposed to doing a prequel (not sure how that could happen but we are all for it).\n\nGOT fans said the reason the sequel it got cancelled was because of how bad season 8 was (Picture: HBO/BSkyB/Kobal/REX)\n\nSifting through the hundreds of comments and theories, one person came up with the idea that HBO made the decision to cancel the prequel because they didn\u2019t want to give too much away.\n\nThey argued: \u2018HBO made a decision not to reveal too much origin wise in order to keep these prequels viable? It makes sense that HBO wouldn\u2019t want the whole story laid out in order to keep some intrigue that would make these prequels viable.\u2019\n\nAnother suggested that\u2019s a good thing the prequel has been axed as then it doesn\u2019t ruin the series for any potential newbies to GOT.\n\nThey exclaimed that: \u2018Imagine the new viewer who didn\u2019t watch GOT and decides to invest time in watching the prequel show, then reads into or watches GOT and is absolutely mind-f****d by the outcome.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActress Emilia has also weighed in on the theories and even though she admits she has no idea why it has been cancelled she did hint that the prequel could still happen at some point.\n\nThe 33-year-old, who played Daenerys Targaryen throughout the series, told Entertainment Tonight: \u2018I\u2019m not really too sure [what happened]. It\u2019s difficult to get stuff made. I wonder.\n\n\u2018Maybe it\u2019ll be reincarnated at some point, but if it wasn\u2019t meant to happen now, then I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because they know that it wasn\u2019t going to be as perfect as it should have been.\u2019\n\nAlthough Bloodmoon is no more, it was confirmed last month that another spin-off has been given the green-light, titled House of the Dragon.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted HBO for comment.\n\nGame Of Thrones is available to stream on Sky, HBO and NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
