I think after that I was the better player.\u2019\n\nWhile seemingly a harsh assessment, Van Gerwen would say it is a fair one as he wins the Champions League for the first time, the only major tournament in the PDC he had not previously won.\n\nMVG is the top player in the world and he knows it: \u2018I\u2019ve got a lot of potential above them [other players]. Peter Wright, every time I play them they get nervous, I just need to make sure I do my own thing in the right moments and put them under pressure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I keep fighting, I never give up, you need to show your balls.\u2019\n\nMighty Mike also reminded everyone just how long he has been at the top in his speech on stage: \u2018I\u2019m not number one in the world for nothing, I have been for six-and-a-half years, try and get my crown off me.\u2019\n\nWith a host of big tournaments coming up ahead of the World Championship in December, Van Gerwen was asked if he could pick up every TV title between now and then.\n\n\u2018Why not?\u2019 Van Gerwen asked. \u2018If someone can do it, I think it\u2019s me.\u2019\n\nThat will be put to the test next weekend when MVG will go to the European Championship as the clear favourite to lift the trophy.\n\nMORE: Michael van Gerwen picks up Champions League of Darts belt after epic comeback against Peter Wright\n\nMORE: Gerwyn Price admits the pressure got to him in classic with Michael van Gerwen at Champions League of Darts", "description": "Michael van Gerwen was not exactly sympathetic after coming from behind to beat Peter Wright in the final of the Champions League of Darts, saying that Snakebite 'bottles it every...", "authors": ["Phil Haigh"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1165535731_1571609560.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
