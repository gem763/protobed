It is such a sad way to die and we have been through a rollercoaster of emotions and we are devastated.\n\n\u2018But we want to express our gratitude to the school and the children, some of them have been so special to us it\u2019s been incredible.\u2019\n\nThe family thanked teachers and friends of Abby for their \u2018overwhelming\u2019 support (Picture: North Wales Live)\n\nDarren added: \u2018When Abby died, it was more like losing a friend. That\u2019s the kind of relationship we had.\n\n\u2018Abby was beautiful, outgoing and confident but nice and caring with it and she always looked out for younger children.\n\n\u2018She loved languages and could speak French and Welsh fluently. She was doing remarkably well at school and had only just started talking about what she wanted to do with her future.\u2019\n\nAbby\u2019s inquest in Ruthin, north Wales, was opened and adjourned ahead of a full inquest into her death due to be held next year.\n\nDarren said: \u2018The amount of people who came to us after she died proved how many people it had affected far and wide and how much she was loved by so many.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
