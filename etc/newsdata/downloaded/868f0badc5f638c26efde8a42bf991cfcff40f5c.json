A beagle seems be to bleeding profusely.\n\nThese images were captured by an undercover activist who worked at the facility. He claims that the animals there were kept in horrific conditions and tests were carried out on beagles, monkeys, cats and rabbits for various companies around the world.\n\nDon't Miss 1.8 K SHARES 10 K SHARES 1.4 K SHARES\n\nCruelty Free International\n\nAn undercover activist got a job at the research facility from December 2018 to March 2019, and says he witnessed testing on beagles, monkeys, cats and rabbits, carried out for companies throughout the world.\n\nFriedrich Mullen from Soko Tierschutz reportedly said, \u201cThe worst treatment was kept for the monkeys. The macaques breed of monkeys are small, relatively light primates, which are often used for animal experiments at LPT. They are kept in cramped conditions in small cages. Many of the animals have developed compulsive tendencies and are seen going round in circles.\u201d\n\nCruelty Free International\n\nThe undercover activist claimed that the animals were treated violently by workers who were not trained animal caretakers.\n\nThe cats are said to be given up to 13 injections per day by untrained professionals and left to suffer.\n\n\u2018LPT is a family-owned contract-testing laboratory carrying out toxicity testing for pharmaceutical, industrial and agro-chemical companies from all over the world in order to meet the requirements of governments and regulatory authorities\u2019, reports Daily Mail.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Cruelty Free International: 'Toxicity testing involves poisoning animals to see how much of a chemical or drug it takes to cause serious harm, in an attempt to measure what a \"safe\" dose for humans might be'.\n\n'Animals are injected with or made to eat or inhale increasing amounts of a substance to measure the toxic effects which can be severe and include vomiting, internal bleeding, respiratory distress, fever, weight loss, lethargy, skin problems, organ failure and even death. No anesthetics or pain relief are provided'.\n\nCruelty Free International\n\nThe CEO of Cruelty Free International is calling for the laboratory to be closed. According to reports, German laws protecting animals from experiments need modification as they are not strict enough.\n\nThe images are indeed horrifying and again bring to question the treatment of animals at the hands of humans.", "description": "Disturbing images of monkeys trapped in metal harnesses and cats and dogs bleeding have come forward from a German toxicology laboratory.
