Since then, GOP leaders have been seeking ways to attract more Hispanic voters to their side. A bipartisan reform bill, they hope, will do just that.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellOvernight Defense: House Dems subpoena White House for Ukraine documents | Pence pulled into inquiry | GOP senator says he confronted Trump over Ukraine aid | Iran hackers target 2020 campaign Trump says House Democrats 'unfortunately' have the votes to impeach Cornyn makes waves with tweet about Justice investigating Biden MORE (R-Ky.) said this week that he\u2019s hopeful Congress will send legislation to Obama\u2019s desk this year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of desire on both sides to move a comprehensive immigration bill,\u201d McConnell told Yahoo News.\n\nClick here to view data from The Hill Poll.\n\n", "description": "A strong majority oppose deporting illegal immigrants, but an equally large share think the borders are not secure.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "published_at": "2013-02-04"}
