Adding cool new features to hardware, software, and gadgets enables companies to sell more products, enter new markets and attract a more diverse set of customers. It puts a fresh coat of paint on established goods while promoting the idea that a brand is innovating rather than standing still. Plus, releasing features incrementally is more affordable than constantly reinventing the wheel.\n\nAll of that makes tremendous sense. The problem with incremental updates, however, is that they are typically so minimalistic in the advances they deliver that they do not always keep pace with changing consumer expectations around a product\u2019s real value. That is, unfortunately, where many brands begin to stumble and lose relevance.\n\nThey get lost in the bits and bytes of their technology and overlook a critically important step of innovation: imbuing the essence of humanity into product development.\n\nWe are in an era where customer experience is king. Gartner even goes so far as to say it is the new marketing battlefront. Nine in 10 adults between the ages of 18 and 34 say they publicly complain and stop buying from a company if they have a bad online experience with a brand.\n\nSimilarly, 51 percent of consumers are more likely to buy from brands that send them personalized messages, such as product recommendations or special offers that take into account their previous purchasing and browsing behavior.\n\nWhen design is driven by important human needs, increased customer loyalty and conversion results. In fact, Forrester research showed that user experiences can raise customer conversion rates up to 400 percent. This won\u2019t come as a news flash to most marketers. But it is probably one of the most overlooked considerations for product managers who are often more concerned with meeting tight product delivery schedules for new features than with responding to consumer feedback in real time for the next iteration.\n\nBy embedding purposeful innovation in design \u2014 rooted in service to humanity \u2014 technology companies have an opportunity to transform while also becoming true partners in their customers\u2019 lives.\n\nCase in point: AI\n\nIn retail, we see this with AI trackers that map user behavior to inform store layouts and more. The clothing chain Uniqlo is experimenting with AI-powered kiosks that provide product recommendations after prompting users to respond to certain colors and styles. The real kicker? Shoppers don\u2019t have to press any buttons; the machines work with neurotransmitters to pick up on brain signals.\n\nStreaming platforms benefit from deeply understanding users as well. From emails alerting viewers of new arrivals to the suggestions for what to view next that pop up at the end of series, Netflix has excelled at using AI to make its product better aligned to its users.\n\nStand for something\n\nTechnology is not the only thing that informs consumer-driven design, however. We know, for example, that modern consumers care very deeply about brands that stand for something. They buy from or boycott brands based not only on the experiences they offer but also on where those companies stand on social issues.\n\nIndeed, a survey found nine in 10 millennials, who are thought to spend $600 billion in the United States each year, would switch brands to one associated with a cause.\n\nIncreasingly, sustainability has become one such cause that consumers are putting their buying power behind. There is a huge opportunity, therefore, for companies to align more closely to customer thinking by designing products for the circular economy.\n\nIn doing so, brands decouple economic activity from the consumption of finite resources and instead design products from recycled materials that can be recycled again \u2014 continuously \u2014 when they reach the end of each life.\n\nFor instance, 3M announced late last year that in 2019, 100 percent of their products would include a Sustainability Value Commitment. The company produces more than 1,000 new products a year, all of which are now evaluated based on factors such as reusability, recyclability, water savings, and more.\n\nCommitments like this are driving the future of humanity-driven design by answering consumers\u2019 desire to live more sustainably with products that support that. In fact, the World Economic Forum and others are now talking about a Fifth Industrial Revolution, which builds on the emerging Fourth Industrial Revolution (robotics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality, and such) but adds \u201cprofit with a purpose\u201d as a compelling factor.\n\nBy 2030, there will be more than three billion technology users globally. This is an irreversible trend and one that could deliver tremendous value to people everywhere. But this progress cannot go forward without deeply considering the role of humanity in our innovation.\n\nLeading companies have vision. They look beyond immediate or incremental improvement opportunities and focus on what will drive lasting impact. They stay informed. Engaged. In touch with what customers care about, whether it\u2019s great experiences or commitments to causes like the environment. What\u2019s more, they leverage, rather than resist, change to create extended value and opportunity.\n\nWith accelerating and disruptive transformation all around us, the question becomes, \u201cHow can companies turn that into opportunity?\u201d The answer is simple: embrace purposeful design \u2014 for the future of humanity.", "description": "By embedding purposeful innovation in design \u2014 rooted in service to humanity \u2014 tech companies can become true partners in their customers\u2019 lives.", "authors": ["Richard Bailey", "September"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/podium?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F09%2FUntitled-design111.png&signature=db945a1b84f32951fe0d0e0f8a84bd88", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
