People familiar with the discussions said a broader settlement to resolve thousands of cases brought by local governments and states could be announced later in the day by state attorneys general.\n\nTo settle the immediate trial, the drug distributors \u2014 McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen \u2014 will pay $215 million to the two Ohio counties that brought the case, people familiar with the agreement said. Teva, the Israel-based manufacturer of generic drugs, is expected to pay at least $15 million in cash and donate $15 million worth of addiction treatment drugs.\n\nWalgreens, the pharmacy chain, is still going forward with the trial for now.\n\nEarlier in the weekend, a smaller distributor named in one case filed, by Summit County, also settled. Henry Schein Medical agreed to contribute $1 million to a grant-making foundation focusing on alternatives for addressing pain and appropriate prescribing of opioids, and to pay $250,000 for the plaintiffs\u2019 legal fees.", "description": "A broader deal may be announced later in the day.
