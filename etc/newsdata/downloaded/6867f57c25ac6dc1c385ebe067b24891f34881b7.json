Now, he\u2019s suing his school district.", "language": "en", "text": "Then, on Oct. 31, 2018, his second-year French students wore virtual-reality goggles and walked around the classroom. The transgender student seemed about to crash when the teacher told another student to help their classmate.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let her hit the wall,\u201d Vlaming shouted.\n\nThat was the last straw for the student, who withdrew from Vlaming\u2019s class. But it was also the last straw for school officials, who suspended the teacher for insubordination, and from the school board, which later fired him, citing how Vlaming had repeatedly ignored orders from his bosses.\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, Vlaming sued school district officials for allegedly violating his right to speak freely and exercise his religion, among other claims. \u201cVlaming\u2019s conscience and religious practice prevents him from intentionally lying,\u201d his lawsuit said, \u201cand he sincerely believes that referring to a female as a male by using an objectively male pronoun is telling a lie.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNeither West Point Public Schools nor its lawyers immediately answered a request for comment from The Washington Post late Monday night.\n\nHe\u2019s not the first teacher to receive some scrutiny for refusing to refer to a transgender student by their preferred pronouns: A math teacher in Jacksonville, Fla., faced reprimands from his principal in August for doing the same thing. Last fall, a professor at Shawnee State University in Ohio said he was \u201cformally charged\u201d for his opposition.\n\nAD\n\nVlaming\u2019s lawsuit, which also seeks an injunction against school officials for punishing teachers who refer to students based on their \u201cbiological sex,\u201d comes amid ideological and legal battles surrounding gender identity, religion and anti-discrimination policies. The Trump administration has rolled back protections for transgender people in schools, in the military, and in health care. In August, a federal judge ruled that a high school in Gloucester County, Va., just down the road from West Point, had violated the rights of student Gavin Grimm after he was barred from using the bathroom of his choice.\n\nAD\n\nVlaming\u2019s legal battle began in the summer of 2018, after the student at his rural high school, about 40 miles east of Richmond, came out as transgender. The student, who had already taken two years of French with Vlaming, asked him to begin referring to him with masculine pronouns.\n\nBut Vlaming called the student female pronouns behind his back to classmates, his lawsuit said, leading to a series of meetings between the teacher, student, the student\u2019s mother and various school administrators, who all asked Vlaming to use the proper pronouns. After each meeting, however, he continued only using the student\u2019s name in class.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of a worse way to treat a child than what was happening,\u201d West Point High School Principal Jonathan Hochman later said at a school board meeting, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAD\n\nCiting policies against creating a hostile learning environment, administrators eventually told Vlaming that he would face disciplinary action if he didn\u2019t comply. One day after the Halloween incident, on Nov. 1, 2018, he was suspended by the superintendent for failing to do so. A week later, she recommended that the school board fire him.\n\n\u201cThat discrimination then leads to creating a hostile learning environment. And the student had expressed that. The parent had expressed that,\u201d West Point schools superintendent Laura Abel said, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. \u201cThey felt disrespected.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 6, 2018, at a packed school board meeting that lasted more than five hours, with crowds of West Point students backing both the teacher and his former student, Vlaming maintained that he was being coerced into using language he didn\u2019t agree with. But the school board disagreed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe issue before us was not one mistaken slip of the tongue,\u201d the school board said in a statement to WWBT.\n\nAD\n\nHis firing led to dueling petitions as well as a walkout in which about 100 students marched out of school grounds carrying signs that read, \u201cMen are men. Women are women,\u201d the TV station reported.\n\nVlaming filed his lawsuit in state court on Monday, naming the West Point school district as well as Abel, Hochman, and Suzanne Aunspach, an assistant principal.\n\nCaleb Dalton, a lawyer with Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal organization in Arizona representing Vlaming, said in a news release Monday that teacher went out of his way to accommodate the student. (ADF, which has run afoul of civil rights advocates, including some charges that it\u2019s a hate group, has also been behind similar lawsuits.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut \u201cthe school board didn\u2019t care how well Peter treated this student,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cIt was on a crusade to compel conformity.\u201d\n\nHe charged that West Point schools are compelling Vlaming to \u201ctake sides in an ongoing public debate about gender dysphoria,\u201d according to the lawsuit, and forcing him to \u201cexpress ideas about human nature\u201d that he believes are false.\n\nFor the school and for the student\u2019s family, however, it comes down to a matter of respect \u2014 and of following instructions. On Halloween 2018, after Vlaming referred to the male-identifying student as \u201cher,\u201d the student waited for the classroom to empty out, according to the teacher\u2019s lawsuit.\n\n\u201cMr. Vlaming, you may have your religion,\u201d he said, upon approaching the teacher, \u201cbut you need to respect who I am.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Peter Vlaming had been fired from his job at West Point High School for refusing to use the pronouns chosen by a transgender student in his high school French class. \"He sincerely believes that referring to a female as a male by using an objectively male pronoun is telling a lie,\" he said in a lawsuit.", "authors": ["Teo Armus", "Reporter On The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Vi546tkfkO5N90R1TVY7tjQw6As=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W7HST6LSCRARPBNO4QEJBUEHL4.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
