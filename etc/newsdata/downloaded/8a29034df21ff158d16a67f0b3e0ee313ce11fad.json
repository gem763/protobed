REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nA drop in the U.S. currency, also tied to trade talks, supported dollar-denominated commodity prices, including oil, which rose after OPEC pledged to make a decision on supply in December.\n\nMarkets were expected to remain highly volatile as high-level U.S.-China trade negotiations were due to continue through Friday. Trump\u2019s comments after the close on Wall Street, calling negotiations \u201cvery, very good,\u201d sent S&P 500 futures higher.\n\nThe euro hit its highest since Sept. 20 versus the dollar as the greenback turned weaker across the board .DXY, partly due to a Bloomberg report about a U.S.-China currency pact to stop the yuan\u2019s devaluation. China\u2019s offshore yuan hit its strongest levels in more than two weeks.\n\nSterling jumped just shy of 2%, on track for its largest gain against the dollar in seven months, after Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said a Brexit deal could be clinched by the end of October after what he called a very positive meeting with Boris Johnson.\n\nThe risk-on environment weighed on the greenback, and even harder on Japan\u2019s yen.\n\n\u201cWith a Brexit deal looking more likely and U.S.-China talks showing more progress, it\u2019s just clear that the dollar is losing some safe-haven demand,\u201d said Juan Perez, senior currency trader at Tempus Inc in Washington.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY fell 0.4%, with the euro EUR= unchanged at $1.1004.\n\nSterling GBP= settled at $1.2440, up 1.9% on the day. The safe-haven yen suffered through a risk-on session and dropped 0.46% to the greenback at 107.96 per dollar.\n\nTRADE THE TWEETS\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet announcing his Friday meeting with Liu gave \u201cmarket participants a reason to believe that perhaps a trade deal or at least a partial trade deal might be announced as early as tomorrow,\u201d said Robert Pavlik chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.\n\nSeparately, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported Liu said Beijing was willing to reach an agreement with Washington to prevent any further escalation of the trade war.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 150.66 points, or 0.57%, to 26,496.67, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 18.73 points, or 0.64%, to 2,938.13 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 47.04 points, or 0.6%, to 7,950.78.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX600 index rose 0.65% and MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.56%.\n\nEmerging market stocks rose 0.35%. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.17% higher, while Nikkei futures NKc1 rose 0.74%.\n\nTreasury yields also rose on hopes of a trade resolution between the United States and China. However, some investors highlighted the difficulty of using the rapidly shifting headlines on trade to direct investment strategy.\n\n\u201cA choppy overnight session driven by conflicting signals regarding trade negotiations highlights the difficulty in chasing every 5 basis point move in yields, in that the proximate justification can unwind just as quickly,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 24/32 in price to yield 1.6698%, from 1.587% late on Wednesday.\n\nThe two-year note <US2YT=RR last fell 5/32 in price to yield 1.5464%, from 1.474% late on Wednesday.\n\nSafe-haven gold fell; spot gold XAU dropped 0.8% to $1,493.85 an ounce.\n\nCopper CMCU3 posted its largest daily gain in a month, up 1.70% to $5,780.50 a tonne.", "description": "Stocks rose on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet with China's top trade negotiator on Friday, while the British pound rallied after the prime ministers of Britain and Ireland revived hopes of a possible Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Rodrigo Campos", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439324952&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991MP", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
