It\u2019ll mark a new era for us,\u201d said Satoshi Toyota, an avid Japan fan and veteran of five World Cups. \u201cI can feel it coming.\u201d The Brave Blossoms hadn\u2019t even beaten Samoa by this point as he speculated upon his nation\u2019s World Cup hopes, but it was clear Mr Toyota \u2013 no relation to the multinational automotive brand, as he was keen to add \u2013 knew what he was talking about.\n\nBy the end of the night, he and 40,000 other Japanese supporters had been treated to a second high-octane performance from the Brave Blossoms at this World Cup, one that nudged the nation another step closer towards the last eight. Japan have never progressed beyond the group stages before. Four years ago they came agonisingly close, winning three out of four of their matches, only to lose out to Scotland\u2019s superior points tally, secured via two crucial bonus points.\n\nBut after their victory last weekend, beating Samoa 38-19 under the floodlights of the Toyota Stadium, Japan now stand poised to wipe clean the pain of the past and embark upon \u201ca new era\u201d. With 14 points to their name and one final game to play, assuming the typhoon-threatened clash with Scotland goes ahead as currently proposed, the hosts have history in their sights \u2013 and, with it, a sense of elevation to the next level.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

That day in Brighton four years announced Japan\u2019s arrival on the international stage, but this tournament has made it clear that the nation won\u2019t be stepping aside anytime soon. They\u2019re no longer a team to be casually dismissed as an obstacle or inconvenience, a mere footnote in the pages of sporting history, but a genuine force to be reckoned with.\n\nThey bullied the Irish into submission. Outfought and outplayed Samoa. And for all the initial nerves against Russia, the eventual 30-10 scoreline reinforced the gulf that has opened up between Japan and the chasing \u2018Tier Two\u2019 pack. Whereas at the 2015 tournament Japan had been the outsiders knocking on the door, this time around they\u2019ve established themselves as the frontrunners. \u201cThey\u2019ve set the tone in our pool,\u201d admitted Samoa captain Jack Lam after his team\u2019s defeat. \u201cWe threw our best punch and it couldn\u2019t come off.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty Images\n\nThe transformation from England 2015 to Japan 2019 has been remarkable. The never-say-die spirit which marked their famous win against South Africa continues to run rich through the Brave Blossoms, but it\u2019s the improved technical aspects to their game which have caught the eye.\n\nJapan\u2019s transitional play has been particularly devastating, leaving their opponents scattered, scrambled and susceptible to the inevitable. Timothy Lafaele\u2019s try against Samoa, coming just before the half-hour mark to hand the hosts their breakthrough, was a fine example of the side\u2019s ability to turn defence into attack.\n\nIt had started with a typically industrious turnover from Michael Leitch, Japan\u2019s resident breakdown burglar. Quickly and efficiently, play was worked to Lomano Lemeki who shuffled into gear on the wing, feet lighting up with electricity as he penetrated the Samoan rearguard. Up next were the Japanese forwards, exerting their raw physicality to maintain the team\u2019s forward momentum while pushing the men in blue deeper and deeper into their own 22. And then, finally, the service from Yutaka Nagare, the smallest man at the World Cup, to set in motion a flurry of hands before Lemeki crashed over near the left flank. Seamless, fluid, breathless \u2013 this was Japan at their collective best.\n\nThen there\u2019s the individual talents present among Jamie Joseph\u2019s squad. Japan have genuine game-changers within their ranks, players capable of producing those moments of magic to turn a match on its head. Lemeki has already had his mention, but the winger is just one half of a deadly duo, with counterpart Kotaro Matsushima blazing a similar trail of destruction. The 26-year-old, who flashed with potential under Eddie Jones four years ago, ran riot against Russia, touching down with a hat-trick of tries, before going on to play a hugely influential role in pinning back the Irish with his pace. And of course it was his late, late try which secured Japan their bonus point against Samoa.\n\nAlong with the likes of Leitch, fly-half Yu Tamura, who has registered the most points of the tournament with 40 to his name, and number eight Kazuki Himeno, another turnover merchant, there\u2019s a glistening array of quality at Joseph\u2019s disposal, which, when slotted together and topped up with a healthy serving of fan fuel, makes for a formidable, typically efficient Japanese machine.\n\nWhich brings us to the showdown with Scotland: a shot at reprisal and revenge. As the team who denied Japan their place in the 2015 quarter-finals, Gregor Townsend\u2019s men head to Yokohama as marked targets. The side that was battered 45-10 by the Scots four years ago is long gone. The Brave Blossoms are hungrier now. Fitter, slicker, quicker and altogether more dangerous. A lot would have to go wrong for Joseph\u2019s side to emerge from the coming collision without their name among the last eight, but the Kiwi and his men are keeping grounded. \u201cThere\u2019s no looking past Scotland,\u201d Lemeki insisted last weekend. \u201cWe\u2019ve never beaten them before in World Cup conditions, so it\u2019s definitely going to be tough but we\u2019ll be ready.\u201d\n\nThat they will. An expectant nation is watching and waiting. No longer are the Japanese mere hosts, content to revel in the prestige and honour that comes with holding a global tournament. Having seen what their men are capable of, the home faithful wants to continue marching up this incline, up to the rarified air of the sport\u2019s heavyweight elite. It\u2019s made for an absorbing spectacle thus far, re-energising the country\u2019s small but fervent rugby fanbase while snagging the attention of the wider public. Indeed, a record peak audience share of 46.1 per cent was recorded on NTV, the national broadcaster, for the Samoa win. But you feel this could be just the beginning.\n\nWith so much progress made, in excelling as a team and capturing the country\u2019s imagination, the coming finale can serve as confirmation of Japan\u2019s ascension to the top table. They, as much as anyone, will want this match to be played. Progression on account of a technicality will no doubt feel hollow for a team that has toiled and strained to reach this stage. Because victory over Scotland can be the moment that, as one fan said, ushers in a \u201cnew era\u201d for the side. With a bright dawn breaking, the red sun of Japan is slowly rising into view.", "description": "\u201cQuarter-finals?
