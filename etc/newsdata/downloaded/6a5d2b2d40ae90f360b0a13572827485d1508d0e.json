That\u2019s made the pound\u2019s valuation \u201cno longer as cheap\u201d as Britain hurtles toward an Oct. 31 deadline to leave the European Union, strategists including Meera Chandan wrote in a Sept. 27 note.\n\nThe bank recommends selling the British currency against the Swiss franc, given that the odds of an exit deal by end-October are \u201cvery low\u201d and the odds of a hard Brexit by January have increased. Additionally, Bank of England policy maker Michael Saunders\u2019s unexpected dovish shift last week adds conviction to the short-sterling view, according to the analysts.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop -- not-so-cheap valuations, ongoing political uncertainty with risks of \u2018no deal\u2019 still lingering and a more dovish BOE -- we view risks to GBP tilted to the downside,\u201d Chandan wrote.\n\nThe pound\u2019s gained over 1% against the dollar in September, and has climbed roughly 1.9% against the Swiss franc to trade near 1.2270. JPMorgan recommends selling pound-franc at 1.22, with a stop at 1.2450.\n\nRecommended trades against the pound have been \u201clight\u201d since early August, given the magnitude of bearish positioning against the currency, the analysts wrote. However, after sterling\u2019s September rally, speculators are the least bearish on the pound since late July, according to the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.", "description": "JPMorgan Doubles Down on Pound Short After Unexpected Rally", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic615145d8c65feaf59c551ea71fe3c9e8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
