CNN announced Wednesday that it would not renew Johnson\u2019s contract when it expires in November because of the new position. CNN vice president and spokesperson Matt Dornic took to Twitter to explain that the decision was made because Johnson is leaving the White House beat.\n\nCNN HAS BAD WEEK AMID APRIL RYAN, CHRIS CUOMO AND DON LEMON NEWS: \u2018IT WAS QUITE EMBARRASSING\u2019\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s now pursuing a different career path and off that beat. Simple as that,\u201d Dornic tweeted in response to a BuzzFeed report announcing CNN\u2019s plans to show Johnson the door.\n\nJohnson, who is widely respected by members of the media industry on both sides of the political aisle, responded to Dornic\u2019s explanation.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize becoming the first female editor-in-chief of a conservative news site was \u2018pursuing a different career path.\u2019 I\u2019ll still be in the newsbreaking business. And perhaps even covering the White House,\u201d Johnson tweeted.\n\nDornic declined a request for comment when reached by Fox News.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck doesn\u2019t buy CNN\u2019s explanation, calling it a \u201clame excuse\u201d for dumping a high-profile conservative.\n\n\u201cI think most sensible people see this for what it is,\" Houck told Fox News. \"Yet again, CNN is showing its vicious hostility to actual conservatives. So long as you're vehemently anti-Trump, hate the Second Amendment, toe the line on any number of liberal issues, and hurl juvenile insults at people you disagree with, CNN will gladly continue to keep you employed as an analyst, commentator, or contributor. Otherwise, watch out.\u201d\n\nJohnson will remain a paid CNN contributor until her contract expires in November.", "description": "Soon-to-be former CNN contributor Eliana Johnson fired back at an executive from the liberal network who explained her new gig running a conservative website as a different career path.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
