I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope? How dare you.

Julia Bascom, executive director of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, said \u201cIt's absolutely unconscionable to attack someone for their disability, especially when that person is a child.\n\n\u201cHistory is full of autistic people and people with other cognitive disabilities who were and are compelling, credible activists and leaders. Greta is a part of that tradition, and our community is lucky to have her.

And believe me, my diagnosis has limited me before.\n\n\u201cBefore I started school striking I had no energy, no friends and I didn\u2019t speak to anyone. I just sat alone at home, with an eating disorder. All of that is gone now, since I have found a meaning, in a world that sometimes seems shallow and meaningless to so many people.\u201d\n\nThe activist has also repeatedly faced claims that she has been indoctrinated by her opera singer mother and actor father, although her parents insist that it was her who convinced them of the urgent need to address climate change.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian in July, her father Svante Thunberg said \u201cShe kept showing us documentaries, and we read books together. Before that, I really didn\u2019t have a clue. I thought we had the climate issue sorted.\u201d", "description": "Fox News has apologised to Greta Thunberg after a conservative pundit described the climate activist as a \u201cmentally ill Swedish child\u201d on the cable news channel.
