The moment you receive this message, I need you to get back to me on my department division toll free number \u2026 verify the last four digits of your Social Security number when you call to better assist you, and if I don\u2019t hear a call from you, we will have to issue an arrest warrant under your name.\n\nSound familiar? This exact phone message is one many people have received lately. It\u2019s frightening, it\u2019s confusing \u2015 and it\u2019s a scam.\n\nLast year, the Federal Trade Commission received complaints from more than 35,000 people who reported this particular phone scam and lost a collective $10 million because of it. But it\u2019s just one of many fraudulent phone calls you could receive. We spoke with the FTC about signs of a phone scam and what to do if you\u2019re targeted.\n\nCommon Signs Of A Phone Scam\n\nPhony calls from the Social Security Administration are what\u2019s known as an \u201cimposter scam,\u201d according to Ian Barlow, the FTC\u2019s \u201cDo Not Call\u201d program manager and staff attorney.\n\n\u201cThe fraud that we get the most complaints about right now, by far, are imposter scams,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cThat includes government imposters and fraudsters impersonating other businesses \u2015 pretending to be Google or Microsoft \u2015 but most especially fraudsters pretending to be the Social Security Administration or the IRS or other government agencies.\u201d\n\nBarlow said that every month, the FTC receives between 400,000 and 500,000 consumer complaints related to unwanted calls, with about 70% of those coming from robocalls or prerecorded messages. In addition to imposters, phone scams often include fake lotteries, prizes and sweepstakes, fraudulent debt reduction products and fraudulent medical and prescription calls.\n\nTo make it harder to spot an imposter, scammers will often employ a strategy called \u201cspoofing,\u201d which causes the caller ID on your phone to display a number belonging to a legitimate organization such as the government or your bank.\n\nBarlow said the FTC has worked with a number of government agencies to put their phone numbers on a registry called the \u201cDo Not Originate list.\u201d This list is provided to telephone companies, instructing them to block any outgoing telephone call that displays one of these numbers as the caller ID (organizations reserve these numbers for incoming calls only).\n\nOther times, scammers will spoof random, individual phone numbers and dial out a million calls, each with a unique caller ID number. That makes it nearly impossible to find the source or block the scammer from calling again.\n\nAdditionally, a current trend among phone scammers is prompting consumers to pay them using gift cards from iTunes, Google Play and Amazon, or other prepaid gift cards. In fact, the percentage of consumers who reported they paid scammers with a gift card rose 270% since 2015. \u201cThat is an immediate red flag,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cNo legitimate business and no government agency is ever going to ask anyone to pay through those methods.\u201d\n\nWire transfers are another common payment method among scammers. Barlow said any phone call requesting payment by wire transfer should give you immediate pause.\n\nWatch Out For Legitimate But Abusive Phone Calls\n\nNot all annoying phone calls from third parties are straight-up scams, according to Barlow, but they can still be abusive and violate the FTC\u2019s Telemarketing Sales Rule.\n\nFor example, you might receive a call pitching solar panels for your home or satellite dishes for Dish Network. It might be a legitimate product, but it\u2019s being sold in an abusive, illegal way.\n\n\u201cUnder the FTC\u2019s Telemarketing Sales Rule, it\u2019s unlawful to place any sales call that delivers a prerecorded message, unless you have the consumer\u2019s permission,\u201d Barlow said, noting that permission must be given in writing. That goes for sales calls to numbers on the Do Not Call Registry as well. And if you do give permission to be contacted, it must be in the manner originally disclosed.\n\n\u201cSo if you receive a call trying to sell you something, and you didn\u2019t ask for that call, that\u2019s a red flag that the company is operating unlawfully. And you never want to provide your personal information or payment information to a company that you know is violating the law,\u201d Barlow said.\n\nWhat To Do If You Think You\u2019re Being Scammed Over The Phone\n\nFraudulent phone calls are so ubiquitous that becoming a target is a matter of when, not if. So what should you do if you receive a phone call that raises red flags?\n\nHang up immediately. If you receive a robocall or sales call and you\u2019re on the Do Not Call Registry (sign up, if you haven\u2019t already), hang up immediately. \u201cThat\u2019s an illegal call and you don\u2019t want to do business with somebody who\u2019s calling you illegally,\u201d Barlow said. If you receive a phone call from a caller ID number you don\u2019t recognize, hang up. Even better, don\u2019t pick up.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not sure whether it\u2019s really the Social Security Administration or your bank or any other legitimate business on the other end of the line, again, hang up. You can go online to find the number for the business that called you and call them back. If the call was legitimate, they\u2019ll connect you with the right person.\n\nReport it. It might seem like a futile effort, but you should report all fraudulent and illegal phone calls. \u201cThe more data we get, the better,\u201d Barlow said, since reporting these calls helps the FTC target its law enforcement and identify trends. To report a phone scam, file a complaint online or call 1-877-FTC-HELP. If you receive a call from someone pretending to be from the IRS, you should also report it to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration online or by calling 1-800-366-4484. For Social Security imposter scams, file a complaint with the Social Security Administration\u2019s Inspector General.", "description": "It probably is.", "authors": ["Money", "Home", "Living Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7bd0b93b0000039fd28275.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
