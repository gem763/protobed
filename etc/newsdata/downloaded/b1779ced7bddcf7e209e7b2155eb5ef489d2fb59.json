Thus female participation has increased almost everywhere [in the world].\"", "description": "People choosing not to retire, more women in the workforce and the \"profound\" changes caused by foreign retailers have all contributed to record low interest rates, the RBA says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1902%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_69/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/34812e871df40ad45f29fe1ce08bff0f300e069f", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
