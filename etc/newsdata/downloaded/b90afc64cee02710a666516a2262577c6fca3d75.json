Healthcare costs are a top issue for Democrats campaigning for their party\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cWe hope to have White House buy-in, because that seems to be the root to getting any votes in the United States Senate, and we want as strong a bipartisan vote as we can in the House and the Senate,\u201d Pelosi told a news conference.\n\nAmericans pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in the world. Most other developed nations have single-payer systems with their governments negotiating prices. Trump has slammed lower drug prices abroad as \u201cglobal freeloading.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s proposal would allow the U.S. government every year to negotiate prices on at least 25 of the 250 most costly drugs that lack competition, a summary of the bill said. The lower prices would be available to all U.S. consumers, not just the government\u2019s Medicare program for the elderly. Companies that refuse to negotiate would face monetary penalties.\n\nDemocrats promised to curb prescription drug prices during last year\u2019s congressional election campaign, when they captured the majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nTrump has also promised to lower prices but has been struggling to deliver on that before the 2020 election.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in an interview with Politico, ruled out any Senate action on Pelosi\u2019s bill but the Republican said the chamber is still \u201clooking at doing something on drug pricing.\u201d\n\nIn the House, Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy labeled Pelosi\u2019s plan \u201cmore socialism.\u201d A drug industry trade group called it \u201cradical\u201d while some liberal House Democrats said it did not go far enough to bring down prices.\n\nPelosi, who consulted with the White House while developing the bill, said she hoped for a bipartisan effort - a rarity in Trump\u2019s highly polarized Washington.\n\n\u201cMy conversations with the president have been about making this a priority,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe that he considers it so and we can work together.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government in 2016 spent around $29 billion on prescription drugs in Medicare\u2019s Part B, which includes most injectable drugs, and nearly $100 billion in Part D, which covers pills and other drugs usually dispensed in pharmacies.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) looks down from a balcony during an interview with CNBC at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 17, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\n\u2018PAINFUL\u2019 PENALTIES\n\nDrug companies that refuse to negotiate would have to pay a \u201cnon-compliance fee starting at 65 percent of the gross sales of the drug in question,\u201d the bill summary said. This would increase by 10% every quarter up to a maximum of 95%. Pelosi said penalties had to be \u201cpainful\u201d in order to work.\n\nThe plan set an upper limit for negotiated prices as no more than 120% of the volume-weighted average of the prices paid in six other countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Britain.\n\nThe price index provision could be aimed at getting White House support, since the Trump administration has said it is working on a similar rule on some Medicare drug prices.\n\nGrassley urged senators to back the drug pricing bill he authored together with Democrat Ron Wyden as the \u201cmoderate\u201d alternative to Pelosi\u2019s approach.\n\nThe drug industry lobbying group PhRMA said Pelosi\u2019s plan \u201cwould end the current market based system that has made the United States the global leader in developing innovative, lifesaving treatments and cures.\u201d\n\nThe Pelosi proposal threads the needle between moderate and more left-leaning Democrats in the House, but is too liberal for the Republican-led Senate, said Dan Mendelson, founder of healthcare consultancy Avalere Health.\n\nSome progressive Democrats want changes in the bill.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) arrives for a House Democratic caucus meeting at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. September 18, 2019.
