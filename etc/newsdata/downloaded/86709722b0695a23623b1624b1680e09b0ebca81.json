Its head of global security services is also leaving immediately.\n\nThe bank said Bouee ordered the security chief to \"initiate the observation\" of former Credit Suisse wealth management chief Iqbal Khan on Aug. 29, when UBS announced Khan's appointment. Bouee says he decided alone to keep tabs on Khan \"in order to protect the interests of the bank\" and didn't discuss the matter with CEO Tidjane Thiam or other top managers.\n\nChairman Urs Rohner says there was \"zero evidence\" that Thiam had been informed about the snooping. Bank officials said Bouee had been concerned that Khan might try to poach employees from Credit Suisse to join him at UBS, and \"the fact that Iqbal Khan continued to socialize with key employees of Credit Suisse had contributed to the COO's concerns,\" Credit Suisse said.\n\nCredit Suisse said it ultimately turned up no indications that Khan had tried to poach employees or clients.\n\nThe \"extraordinary\" and \"irregular\" episode \u2014 as top executives put it \u2014 testifies to the intense rivalry between UBS and Credit Suisse, whose key offices co-habit the Paradeplatz square in downtown Zurich that is the heart of Switzerland's vibrant and well-heeled financial sector.\n\n\"It's not, obviously, the standard way as to how we conduct our business,\" Rohner told reporters in Zurich. Credit Suisse officials acknowledged that some encrypted chat messages were deleted, and Credit Suisse's hired legal experts did not have access to police files.\n\nThe snooping came to a head when Khan \"spotted and confronted one of his tails\" in downtown Zurich on Sept. 17, the culmination of nearly two weeks of on-and-off tracking.\n\nSwiss media reported that Khan, noticing that he had been trailed while on a shopping excursion, emerged from his car and started to take photos of the license plate of the private investigator's vehicle. The investigator then insisted that Khan stop doing that, told Khan to hand over his phone, at which point Khan started to shout out for police help \u2014 and the investigator left.\n\nSwiss news reports also said Khan's exit from Credit Suisse followed a cocktail party at Thiam's home \u2014 the two men are next-door neighbors in a posh lakeside town near Zurich \u2014 in January at which the two men, previously known to be personal friends, had an argument.\n\nCredit Suisse said it did not investigate the events at that party.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
