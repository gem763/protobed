Schumer, New York Democrat, said in a letter to colleagues that they must quickly approve a background-check expansion bill that\u2019s already cleared the House.\n\n\u201cThere have been 289 mass shootings so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. That is not counting the thousands of other acts of gun violence, which are no less damaging to the victims, families, and communities in which they occur,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.\n\nDemocrats are intent on having a freewheeling fight on the Senate floor, figuring that they\u2019ll either prevail on the policy or at the very least force Republicans to cast votes that can be used against them in elections.\n\nMr. McConnell is trying to head off that sort of fight.\n\nHe\u2019s said he will only put a bill on the floor if it\u2019s clear the policy has enough support to become law \u2014 meaning it can pass the Senate and get President Trump\u2019s signature. He said this week he\u2019s waiting for word from the White House about what the president wants to see.\n\nIn a memo to reporters, Mr. McConnell\u2019s office said his priorities in September will be approving the president\u2019s nominees, with votes scheduled beginning Monday on an ambassadorial post.\n\nThen the Senate will turn to the annual spending process, where Congress must approve 12 bills to fund government operations before a shutdown deadline of Sept. 30.\n\nMr. Schumer seemed less worried about preventing a shutdown and more interested in setting up thorny fights over the spending bills.\n\nHe said Democrats will try to insert money into the bills to pay for better election security.\n\nBut he, along with Mr. McConnell, the top leaders in the House and Mr. Trump\u2019s team all struck a deal earlier this summer to keep the spending process as painless as possible. One of the terms was no big new policy fights breaking out.\n\nDemocrats are determined to try to find some way to raise issues surrounding Russian meddling and Mr. Trump\u2019s attitude toward it.\n\nIn the House, that means an ongoing inquiry Democrats say is the prelude to possible impeachment. Senate Democrats, in the minority in their chamber, don\u2019t have investigative powers, but can make life troublesome for Mr. McConnell through use of the legislative filibuster.\n\n\u201cLeader McConnell has blocked efforts by Senate Democrats to pass commonsense election security legislation. We must continue our push to protect our elections at the federal, state, and local levels, especially in the upcoming Senate appropriations process,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.\n\nMr. McConnell says there\u2019s already strong action on election security going on behind the scenes that Americans don\u2019t know about.\n\nOther priorities for Mr. Schumer include legislation to punish China after its crackdown on protests in Hong Kong, and will dabble in health care legislation, attempting to turn back a Trump administration rule that would give states more power to approve affordable, though less robust health plans for sale under Obamacare.\n\nDemocrats say their support for Obamacare delivered victories in last year\u2019s congressional elections, and are eager for a repeat in 2020.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
