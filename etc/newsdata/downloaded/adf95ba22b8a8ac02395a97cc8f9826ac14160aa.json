The report came after a rumor emerged Tuesday that the Cleveland Browns were interested in the 31-year-old.\n\nWilliams, who is holding out over his contract and a dispute with the team\u2019s medical staff, has yet to play this season. He missed all of training camp and is facing over $1 million in fines for holdout.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019d say on Redskins OT Trent Williams\u2019 trade value \u2014 asking price isn\u2019t high, because there really hasn\u2019t been an asking price. Teams I\u2019ve spoken with that inquired have been stonewalled, told he\u2019s not available.\n\n\n\nMaybe that changes over the next 13 days. We\u2019ll see. \u2014 Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) October 16, 2019\n\nTeam president Bruce Allen told reporters last week that he would not consider trading the left tackle.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
