The case involves a law firm, Seila Law, that refused to comply with a CFPB request for documents.\n\nThe firm challenged the agency's structure as unconstitutional, arguing that the bureau\u2019s director enjoys an illegal amount of independence from the president\u2019s executive branch authority.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Trump administration and CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger have backed the challenge, which could transform or even dismantle the agency.\n\nHouse Democrats urged the Supreme Court to reject Seila Law\u2019s appeal for a ruling, insisting that Congress did not infringe on separation of powers.\n\nThe CFPB was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to police the financial sector for consumer fraud and abuse. Dodd-Frank prevents the president for firing the CFPB director before his or her five-year term expires unless \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is considered to be severe neglect or misconduct.\n\nSeila Law and the Trump administration argue that the \u201cfor cause\u201d provision hinders the president\u2019s constitutional authority over the executive branch.\n\nA district court ruled in favor of the CFPB and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling, leading Seila Law to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Seila case is the first of several unsuccessful legal challenges to the CFPB to reach the Supreme Court, including cases pending appeals in the Fifth and Second Circuits.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in 2016 that the controversial watchdog agency's structure was unconstitutional.

CFPB allies fear the court could rule the entire agency unconstitutional and shut it down.\n\nBut the court\u2019s order taking up the case presented a potential salvation for the CFPB. The court asked the agency's defenders and Seila Law to argue whether the \u201cfor cause\u201d provision can be severed from Dodd-Frank to eliminate an unconstitutional check on the president\u2019s power.\n\nThe CFPB has been the center of a fierce partisan battle since its creation in Dodd-Frank.
