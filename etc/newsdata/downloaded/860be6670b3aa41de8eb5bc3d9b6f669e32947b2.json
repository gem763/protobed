He said that stabbings also contributed to the high death rate.\n\nPhilippines: mid-terms clear way for Duterte to reinstate death penalty Read more\n\nTamayo made the claim on Thursday at a senate hearing on the Good Conduct Time Allowance law, which allows the early release of prisoners for positive behaviour. Following the claim, senate president Vicente Sotto III was quoted as saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t need [the] death penalty anymore.\u201d\n\nWoeful prison conditions in the Philippines, which has not had the death penalty since 2006 despite some politicians calling for its return, have been highlighted by the hearing.\n\nLast month it was reported by Rappler that one hospital ward in the NBP, which has been criticised by the United Nations as well as Filipino authorities, did not provide showers for inmates. Prisoners washed with water poured from drums.\n\nGodfrey Gamboa, a former inmate at the NBP, claimed that many prisoners there died due to being given food that had gone bad. \u201cA lot of them die because most of the food is already spoiled. They get weak,\u201d he said.\n\nUrsicio Ce\u00f1as, a doctor at the NBP, was accused of taking bribes from influential prisoners in exchange for granting them extended access in the hospital section, away from the main prison areas.\n\nSerial killers and high-profile drug lords have been detained in the NBP, where around 43% of inmates are incarcerated for homicide and physical injury-related crimes.", "description": "Prison hospital chief says about 5,200 die in Bilibid each year, mostly from infectious diseases", "authors": ["Jamie Fullerton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f73a56a31f99cfee573aeefb37cf5d92707be1cc/0_0_4096_2459/master/4096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=69a5b2edf3924393b1bbca377fa5fabd", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
