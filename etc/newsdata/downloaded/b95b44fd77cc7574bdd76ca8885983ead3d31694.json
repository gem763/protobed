Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Monday said that an undetermined, small number of US troops could still be stationed in northeast Syria to secure oil fields and prevent ISIS from taking control.\n\nThe president has long cited his campaign promise to reduced the US presence in the Middle East, and to limit the country's involvement in \"endless wars.\"\n\nRead more: Trump reportedly called Jim Mattis the 'world's most overrated general' in a chaotic meeting on Syria\n\n\"USA soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zones,\" Trump said in a now-deleted tweet on Sunday. \"We have secured the Oil. Bringing soldiers home!\"\n\nTrump's decision to withdraw US forces caught numerous military officials and lawmakers by surprise, and attracted bipartisan condemnation for what they characterized as an abandonment of US allies and principles. Roughly 11,000 Kurds \u2014 who were allied with the US in the region \u2014 were killed in the fight against ISIS, and many more were relied upon by the US to evict the extremists from their strongholds.\n\n\"This impulsive decision by the president has undone all the gains we've made, thrown the region into further chaos, Iran is licking their chops, and if I'm an ISIS fighter, I've got a second lease on life,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham said during a Fox News interview on October 7. (On Sunday, in an about-face, Graham told Fox News he is \"increasingly optimistic this could turn out very well.\")\n\nFormer US Central Command commander and retired Army Gen. Joseph Votel also condemned the withdrawal, and reflected on the US's reliance on the Kurds.\n\n\"Without it, President Donald Trump could not have declared the complete defeat of ISIS,\" Votel wrote of the Kurdish help against ISIS in Syria. Trump has frequently claimed ISIS has been unequivocally defeated.\n\nThe US has pulled out 2,000 troops from Afghanistan so far this year, bringing the total number of forces in the country to around 13,000, Task & Purpose reported. Earlier in October, Esper said he was confident the US military could withdraw thousands more troops without adversely affecting operations.\n\nEsper, who visited Afghanistan on Monday, advised not to compare US policy for Syria with that of Afghanistan.\n\n\"Very different situations, very different adversaries if you will, very different level of commitment,\" he said, according to NBC News. \"Very clear policy direction on one.\n\n\"All these things should reassure Afghan allies and others they should not misinterpret our actions in the region in the recent week or so in regard to Syria and contrast that with Afghanistan,\" Esper added.", "description": "The US has pulled out 2,000 troops from Afghanistan so far this year, bringing the total number of forces in the country to around 13,000.", "authors": ["David Choi"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dae1494cc4a0a514437825f?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
