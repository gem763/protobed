Locke is an older man with bushy white eyebrows, bushier sideburns, and a warm, low voice. He lives in the upper reaches of Mandeville Canyon, a long, narrow strip north of Los Angeles, east of Westridge Canyonback Wilderness Park, and right in the middle of a mandatory fire evacuation zone.\n\n\u201cI picked up the phone and my neighbor said, \u2018Get your shit together,\u2019\u201d Locke recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018And do it in five minutes. There\u2019s an evacuation order.\u2019 I just grabbed whatever I could: the backup for my computer, a cellphone, a few dollars, some papers, my wallet, that\u2019s it. I barely had time to put on clothes. It was early Monday morning\u2014the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nJust hours before Locke\u2019s call, a strong wind had knocked a tree branch into a powerline, sparking a fire along the 405 Freeway near the Getty Center, the renowned art and architecture museum overlooking Los Angeles. The blaze spread quickly, burning hundreds of acres within hours, and requiring evacuations around wealthy neighborhoods like Brentwood and Pacific Palisades.\n\nAlong with roughly 10,000 of his neighbors, Locke fled the area that morning. He headed seven miles south to the Westwood Recreation Center, a sprawling complex situated at the center of a West Los Angeles park. By rec-center standards, the Westwood facility has posh amenities: a pool, a playground, a tennis court, a soccer field, two gymnasiums, indoor racquetball courts, outdoor basketball courts, and the original baseball diamond that inspired The Bad News Bears. It does not, however, have beds. Still, within the span of a few hours, Locke saw the place converted from neighborhood sports center to active evacuation shelter. Volunteers unfolded cots in the gym. Neighbors brought food to the dining hall. Thousands streamed in and out, chatting, drinking coffee, ushering animals into the rooms designated for pets.\n\nIn a press conference Tuesday evening, Mayor Eric Garcetti confirmed the Getty Fire had burned more than 650 acres and was 15 percent contained. It\u2019s one of several wildfires scorching the state. Hundreds of miles to the north, the Kincaid Fire has burned more than 75,000 acres of Sonoma\u2019s Wine Country, closing schools, cutting power, and forcing almost 200,000 people from their homes. As of Tuesday, that blaze was also just 15 percent contained and authorities said it could burn for weeks.\n\nLate Tuesday night, Locke sat in a chair in the lobby, his walker pushed to the side. The room had been divided into stations: a line of chairs under a giant fabric mural of a boat, a welcome desk staffed by the Red Cross, two folding tables piled with donated snacks, and a computer area, where two PCs were set to TV networks: one played the World Series, the other flickered with clips from fire coverage.\n\nLocke was chatting with a woman named Kathleen Jensen, a volunteer who once lived in the evacuation zone. Jensen had arrived at the rec center the day before to see if anyone needed help. She had met a shy older woman with back problems, who was scared to stay over. Jensen wound up spending the night, tending to the woman, comforting and befriending her. By Tuesday, both Jensen and Locke had spent two days just talking to evacuees and reporters. There had been so many different kinds of people, they said, even some famous ones. Mayor Garcetti came to talk; Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s wife swung by.\n\n\u201cLester Holt came!\u201d Locke remembered.\n\n\u201cLester Holt?\u201d Jensen asked, her face lighting up. \u201cOh, I just love Lester Holt. You know Lester Holt, right? From NBC? Oh, he\u2019s just the best.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said to him,\u201d he continued, \u201cLester, I love you. The only thing I don\u2019t like is you\u2019re always badmouthing my boy, Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jensen sighed. \u201cDid you say that? Well, I love Lester Holt.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the best guy on TV,\u201d Locke agreed. \u201cI met a lot of people\u2013dozens of people, interesting people. I\u2019ve never heard more namedropping than today. Everybody knows somebody famous. One guy knew Steve McQueen. He knew Marlon Brando. He told me Marlon Brando was gay, but I already read that. That shocked me when I found out. Brando\u2019s gay? Who knew!\u201d\n\nWhen asked why he heard so much namedropping, Locke paused. \u201cI guess it\u2019s just when you get talking to people. My wife died about a year ago, and I work at home. I talk to people on the phone. But here, I\u2019ve just been sitting talking to people for two days. This one guy was telling me crazy crap. Like, he was one of the top karate experts in the United States. And he said, \u2018I\u2019ve got a 100-pound wolf. I use it as a dog.\u2019 And I said, \u2018That guy\u2019s nuts.\u2019 But then he came back with a damn wolf.\u201d\n\nAfter some small talk, Jensen announced she was going home. The woman she\u2019d been caring for had found friends. And besides, the shelter numbers were dwindling. People were going to friends\u2019 houses or hotels. But Locke hadn\u2019t heard much about his home.\n\n\u201cThey keep telling you the same thing: \u2018We don\u2019t know,\u2019 \u2018We can\u2019t say,\u2019\u201d he said, without resentment. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of dormant now, but this huge Santa Ana wind is coming in tonight. It\u2019s gonna last all night\u2014until 8 in the morning. After that, it may be OK. But nobody knows. They\u2019re all telling you something different. You just can\u2019t tell. And I can\u2019t phone any of my neighbors either cause they\u2019ve all split.\u201d\n\nThe wind in question was a major event, forecast to begin around 11 p.m. Tuesday night, peaking at 3 a.m., and lasting until 8 a.m. Wednesday morning. The gusts were predicted to hit hurricane-like speeds\u2013\u2013as high as 80 miles per hour in some areas\u2013\u2013so high, the National Weather Service issued their first ever \u201cextreme\u201d red flag warning for the region.\n\nBetsey Landis, a former electrical engineer and another guest at the Westwood Rec Center (whom Locke described as \u201cthe smartest person here\u201d), said the winds could bode well or very badly. \u201cIf the wind blows against the fire, which gives the firemen more chance to smother it all, then we\u2019re in good shape,\u201d Landis said, \u201cBut if it blows from the north to the west, we could have some more serious problems.\u201d\n\nLandis has lived in Mandeville Canyon for 50 years. \u201cI live at the top,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s five miles up.\u201d She had fled much like Locke: in the middle of Monday night, after a series of increasingly alarming phone calls. Landis is a stately woman, with blue eyes, shoulder-length gray hair, and a brown cane. She dressed like someone in the Audubon Society: earth-tone slacks, green jacket, a colorful handkerchief tied at the neck, a brown fedora with bird feathers in the brim.\n\n\u201cI evacuated just once before,\u201d Landis said, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t a true evacuation. There was a house fire, but it was started by a couple guys smoking marijuana cigarettes in the backyard and throwing them over the fence. It rolled up the hillside behind me, and this police helicopter hung out with a very loud horn, going GET OUT RIGHT NOW GET OUT GET OUT. So, I got out. But I just went over to UCLA. My two neighbors both work at UCLA, so I just went with them.\u201d\n\nThis time felt more real, Landis said. Her home wasn\u2019t in danger, as far as she knew. But the fire alarms, the escape route, the shelter\u2014it was all weightier and better executed than some cop screaming from a chopper. \u201cThis is my first time to see the whole process,\u201d she said. \u201cYou hear all these things about what happens when people have to go to some kind of evacuation center. I\u2019ve really enjoyed sitting here watching who comes through the doors when, what happens here, how fast the Red Cross and people have come to help. I\u2019ve learned just how uncomfortable it is to lie on a steel frame cot in the gym.\u201d", "description": "After fleeing to safety and in fear for their homes, Los Angeles residents hunkered down on uncomfortable cots.
