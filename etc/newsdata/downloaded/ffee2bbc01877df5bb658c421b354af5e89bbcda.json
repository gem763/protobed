We must protect Jewish life.\"\n\nChancellor Angela expressed her shock at the attack, saying \"Hatred, racism and anti-Semitism have no place in our country,\" adding that the state needed to use all available means to take action against hatred.\n\nMore: Shooting which killed two in Germany was 'anti-Semitic attack' - Interior Minister\n\nMore: Amateur footage emerges of gunman opening fire in Halle, Germany\n\nFears of more attacks\n\nThe news has heightened fears of more anti-Semitic violence in a nation still scarred by the Holocaust. Attacks on Jews rose by 20% last year and were mainly carried out by right-wing extremists.\n\nMerkel joined a vigil held at a synagogue in Berlin last night, attended by around 200 people.\n\nRenate Keller, a 76-year-old attending the vigil with her husband, said the attack in Halle showed that Germany was not doing enough to fight anti-Semitism.\n\n\u201cIt scares me that after the Holocaust some people have learned nothing from our history, which still weighs on us today,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople like the attacker have probably never met a Jew in their lives. They are just blinded by hatred.\u201d\n\nOther members of Germany\u2019s 200,000-strong Jewish community expressed similar alarm over the attack.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Samuel Tsarfati, a 27-year-old stage director, as he left a Berlin synagogue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence it happened in east Germany. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is very strong there,\u201d Tsarfati said. Leaders of the AfD party, which made big gains in elections in two eastern states last month, condemned Wednesday\u2019s attack in Halle.\n\nPolice in the spotlight\n\nMost Jewish institutions in Germany's large cities have a near-permanent police guard due to occasional anti-Semitic attacks by both far-right activists and Islamist militants.\n\nJosef Schuster, president of the council of Germany's Jewish community, criticised police for not being stationed outside the synagogue that was attacked as dozens prayed inside.\n\n\"If police had been stationed outside the synagogue, then this man could have been disarmed before he could attack the others,\" Schuster told Deutschlandfunk public radio.\n\nIn the event, the synagogue's solid locked gates and high walls provided ample protection against the attacker's seemingly improvised weapons.\n\nSchuster said that while it was normal practice in his experience for all synagogues to have police guards while services were being conducted inside, this appeared not to be the case in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, where Halle is located.\n\nHowever, the head of Germany's police union was sceptical about providing that level of protection.\n\n\"We'd have to guard every synagogue, every church, every mosque, every holy place in Germany around the clock, so I don't know if this was a mistake or if this really couldn't have been foreseen,\" Oliver Malchow told ARD public television.\n\nNew Zealand-style attack\n\nThe attack appeared to be modelled on last year's gun attack on a New Zealand mosque, in which the perpetrator streamed his actions live on social media.\n\nIn a video of more than 30 minutes that Stephan B. live-streamed from a helmet camera, he was heard cursing his failure to enter the synagogue before shooting dead the two victims.\n\nHe livestreamed the violence on the gaming platform Twitch, with the video then shared across white supremacist channels on the encrypted messaging app Telegram.", "description": "A gunman livestreamed an anti-Semitic attack outside a German synagogue on Wednesday, leaving two people dead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/22/02/1000x563_cmsv2_6fa7411f-a6e1-561f-8db1-8270fe04be2c-4222202.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
