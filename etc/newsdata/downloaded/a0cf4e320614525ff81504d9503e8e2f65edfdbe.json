So we asked one of SA\u2019s top comedians to weigh in on Ramy.\n\nCape Town - \"There\u2019s Friday prayers and there\u2019s Friday night, and I\u2019m at both!\u201d Ramy said, exasperated. A dazed and confused twenty-something, he\u2019s having a hard time finding himself, caught between his culture and the modern world.\n\nBut this is unlike any show of that type that we\u2019ve seen before. Ramy, which is streaming on Showmax, is the creation of Ramy Youssef, the American stand-up comedian with Egyptian heritage. Youssef has been building a strong career as a comic who explores cultural similarities and differences, as well as his own Muslim faith.\n\nWATCH THE TRAILER HERE:\n\nRamy is comparable to Orange Is the New Black: edgy, smart and daring. Youssef plays the lead role, a fictional character named Ramy Hassan who, as Youssef put it, is a millennial Muslim struggling to make the two work together. Over ten episodes we get to know Ramy, his family, romances, own culture, other cultures, ecstasy, Ramadan, America, underage drinking, masturbation and Osama Bin Laden. It\u2019s quite a ride!\n\n\"I really wanted to make something where it showed someone struggle with faith in an honest way,\" Youssef told Stephen Colbert on the Late Show. \"A lot of stuff is very anti-religion, which I understand. It\u2019s not like religion has been doing itself any favours as a culture and industry. But I still had faith and I wanted to show that. So, watching Muslims, in this case, Arab Muslims, deal with what they believe and what they actually do.\"\n\nDoes his show pull this off? We asked Cape Town-based comedian Yaaseen Barnes, well-known on SA\u2019s comedy circuit, what he thought of the first season:\n\n\"I loved Ramy. It feels very close to my lived experience. It\u2019s Muslim people being people. We have normal problems with the world, but also how we deal with our faith in the modern world at the same time. It\u2019s that constant struggle of finding the balance.\"\n\nMEET RAMY\n\nRamy Hassan is not getting his life together, even though he really wants to. Good intentions are no match for his agonised but laid back demeanour. Ramy looks to his faith to try and anchor him, but a lot of what he does is not really in synch with that. He\u2019s not dysfunctional - Ramy just doesn\u2019t have his act together.\n\nMany of the people around Ramy compensate in some way by using their faith or their worldly desires, from his dodgy friends hanging in New Jersey to his crazy relatives abroad. Most prominent are his family: Ramy\u2019s caring but strict dad, his loving mother, his acerbic and brilliant sister, and his incomprehensibly racist uncle. Most of the show is about Ramy. But the season also devotes significant time to the lives of his family.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s a very real show,\" said Barnes. \"If you look at his parents, of what they struggled for and what they had to sacrifice to get where Ramy is. It\u2019s nice to see their stories as well.\"\n\nFUNNY PEOPLE BEING PEOPLE\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a Muslim show. It\u2019s a show about Muslims and other people. Ramy builds on similarities and shines a spotlight on the strange little things that we have in common.\n\nIn Ally McBeal, it was through a female lawyer in an absurd man\u2019s world. In Blackish, it\u2019s via an affluent black family in white suburbia. In Orange Is the New Black, it\u2019s jail like we\u2019ve never experienced before. Now it\u2019s about Muslims trying to live a traditional life in the land of rock \u2018n roll. This is why Barnes sees Ramy as unique:\n\n\"It shows you Muslims working at becoming Muslim. We\u2019re not just 'I\u2019m a Muslim and all I do is pray all day.' I just live a normal life. So I think it\u2019s great for outsiders. It shows that we also struggle to learn religion, that we struggle to find ourselves in religion. It\u2019s about people being people. These are just Muslim people.\"\n\nBut, he adds, that\u2019s not why you should watch it: \"The show is really good. Even if you take the whole Muslim factor away, it\u2019s a great show. You see a person try and find their place in the world.\"\n\nAlso, there are conversations about sending pictures of your genitals and a good lesson on why you shouldn\u2019t eat your friend\u2019s powerful gummy bear pain killers. Ramy is something else.", "description": "The year\u2019s most original and groundbreaking show is not what you\u2019d expect.
