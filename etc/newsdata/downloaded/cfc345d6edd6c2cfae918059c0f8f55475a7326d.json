REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\n(Reuters) - Kiki Bertens topped her round robin group in convincing fashion with a 6-4 6-3 victory over Dayana Yastremska to become the first player to qualify for the semi-finals of the WTA Elite Trophy in Zhuhai, China on Thursday.\n\nBoth players had already beaten Croatia\u2019s Donna Vekic earlier this week, which made the final round robin match a virtual quarter-final where the Dutch top seed got the better of the 19-year-old Ukrainian.\n\nYastremska\u2019s poor service game in the opening set \u2014 she made four double faults in three games \u2014 opened the door for Bertens who broke her teenaged opponent five times in the encounter.\n\nAlthough Yastremska also converted two break points, she was no match for Bertens\u2019 patient baseline game which forced the Ukrainian to make numerous errors and a fifth double fault on match point ended the contest.\n\n\u201cChanging the rhythm, I think that\u2019s what she doesn\u2019t like,\u201d Bertens told reporters. \u201cShe really likes that every ball is coming at the same height, at the same pace.\n\n\u201cSo just throwing in some slices \u2014 I think she\u2019s really struggling with that, I saw that already in Beijing and I think today again. That\u2019s what I normally do already, but I think that against players like Dayana, even more.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Czech Republic\u2019s Karolina Muchova fought back from a set down in her round robin opener to beat American Alison Riske 2-6 6-2 7-5.\n\nMuchova, who converted six of 13 break points, was 3-1 down in the deciding set before clawing her way back into the tie to keep her semi-final hopes alive.\n\nMeanwhile, American third seed Madison Keys overcame fifth seed Petra Martic of Croatia 6-3 6-4.", "description": "Kiki Bertens topped her round robin group in convincing fashion with a 6-4 6-3 victory over Dayana Yastremska to become the first player to qualify for the semi-finals of the WTA Elite Trophy in Zhuhai, China on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444521878&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1AL", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
