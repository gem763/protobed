They\u2019re benefiting from the mistakes of the referees Mamelodi Sundowns coach, Pitso Mosimane\n\nMosimane has laughed off the jibe. \u201cObsessed? What\u2019s new there?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cIf you personalise this, then that\u2019s your own problem. I\u2019m not saying that they\u2019re cheating or that referees are helping them. They\u2019re benefiting from the mistakes of the referees. It might be us tomorrow,\u201d he said during an interview with City Press on Friday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big competitor because I want to win, as long as there\u2019s fair play.\u201d\n\nAmakhosi are currently on top of the Absa Premiership log.\n\nMosimane\u2019s comments were in direct reference to the match officials who erred in ruling out AmaZulu\u2019s two goals in their league game against Chiefs recently, which Amakhosi went on to win.\n\nChiefs were also awarded a penalty against Golden Arrows last week in a match they again went on to win.\n\nBut they have also conceded two penalties so far this season.\n\nTheir loss to Polokwane City \u2013 their only defeat so far \u2013 came from the penalty spot conversion.\n\nIn addition, they conceded a last-minute penalty against SuperSport United, but Bradley Grobler missed his spot kick.\n\nMosimane\u2019s comments could be seen as fuelling the fire against his rivals ahead of the clash between Chiefs and Sundowns in the Shell Helix Cup at FNB Stadium on Saturday.\n\nThe two powerhouses will follow up the once-off exhibition match with a league encounter on October 27.\n\nMosimane\u2019s comments were made during a live post-match interview after his side\u2019s 2-1 win over Black Leopards midweek to highlight that the match officials had erred in denying Sundowns a penalty.\n\nIf the club feels there\u2019s something to respond to, we\u2019ll issue an official statement.

We need to give opportunities to some of the players who aren\u2019t playing regularly.\n\n\u201cThe [exhibition] game is good for us. I don\u2019t mind playing every three days. The only challenge is the travelling,\u201d said Mosimane, in reference to Sundowns\u2019 trips for the CAF Champions League assignments.\n\nHowever, Chiefs have their own juggling act to take on next weekend as coach Ernst Middendorp and his technical team brace themselves for back-to-back matches.\n\nAfter the match against Sundowns in Johannesburg on Saturday, another Chiefs team must be in the Free State on Sunday to face Bloemfontein Celtic at Free State Stadium in the Macufe Cup.\n\n\u201cWe have the programmes in place and the technical staff are very involved. So we have teams to compete in the two competitions [Helix and Macufe],\u201d said Motaung.\n\n\u201cMore games means it\u2019s only fair that the coach gives other players a chance to play,\u201d he added, referring to the fringe players.\n\nMeanwhile, Mosimane said he was anticipating a tough draw when CAF reveals the line-up of the Champions League group phase in Cairo, Egypt, on Wednesday.", "description": "Bobby Motaung dismisses Mosimane\u2019s jibe about Chiefs as resulting from his \u2018obsession\u2019 with them.", "authors": ["Daniel Mothowagae"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/b66b352f8887439a823cf0b97a3e7630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
