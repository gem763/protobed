Of course, that doesn't mean that running afoul of its own rules \u2014 resulting, for example, in the suspension of a cash-cow football team \u2014 wouldn't be a death knell for an institution's athletic program.", "description": "That doesn't mean the situation can't get really confusing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/MjbybkAZGLgpxmjYzfeZPeYB5Zk=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/03/1570105871588.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
