Youth is rising up. They know they\u2019re fighting for their future against a dictatorial regime,\u201d said Kong Tsung-gan, an author and well-known blogger, on Twitter.\n\n\u201cTotalitarianism is going to destroy our next generation, resist!\u201d wrote another person on Twitter.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said after school term started in September, nearly 40% of those arrested were under 18, while 10% of those arrested last Sunday were under 15.\n\nA growing number of children have been arrested or injured in the increasingly violent and radical protests in recent weeks.\n\nA Hong Kong policeman fired at an 18-year-old high school student\u2019s chest during heated, territory-wide protests on China\u2019s National Day on 1 October, while a 14-year-old was shot in the thigh by a plainclothes police officer last Friday during protests against the anti-mask ban. In a recent protest, an 11-year-old was sent to hospital after sustaining an injury.\n\nLam announced last Friday that the government had invoked the Emergency Regulations Ordinance to pass a regulation forbidding the use of face masks. There are widespread fears that the government would introduce more draconian measures to suppress civil freedoms.\n\nWhile Lam said she cared \u201cdeeply\u201d for students, they should not participate in violent attacks and the anti-mask ban was aimed at \u201chelping parents, teachers and students recognise that they shouldn\u2019t be engaged in these acts.\u201d\n\nSchools across Hong Kong required parents to sign a notice saying they understood masks should not be worn inside or outside school.\n\n\u201cWhen [young people] are on the streets fighting selflessly, they are called \u2018criminals and rioters\u2019,\u201d said Kenneth Chan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. \u201cThe gap between the young people and the officials is impossible to bridge now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a total breakdown of trust between the government and young people. It can only get worse because Carrie Lam has nothing but harsh measures to suppress and intimidate the young people and their parents.\u201d", "description": "Hong Kong officials say a third of 2,379 protesters arrested during four months of protests are under 18", "authors": ["Verna Yu"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83d53b6731374b5b01834075966cc328bcbef538/0_138_4149_2489/master/4149.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=91d1edb0c9c0354a2b7fe8a6fcebdb06", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
