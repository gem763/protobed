By that point we were more than two hours in, and I was trying to double-check numbers for something I was working on. Then something permeated: Did someone say something about record players?\n\nSomeone did \u2014 specifically, former vice president Joe Biden. He was responding to a question about the legacy of slavery, particularly as it pertains to education. Earlier this year, The Washington Post reported on Biden\u2019s legacy of opposing school busing, a history that was the focus of an effective attack on Biden in the first Democratic debate by Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.).\n\n\u201cI want to come to you and talk to you about inequality in schools and race,\u201d debate moderator Linsey Davis said Thursday night. She quoted Biden in 1975 saying that he didn\u2019t \u201cfeel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said that some 40 years ago,\u201d Davis continued. \u201cBut as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?\"\n\nA complex if direct question. To which Biden offered a complex and wildly indirect response.\n\nI went back and watched it several times to figure out what Biden was trying to say and the path he took to get there. Allow me to be your tour guide.\n\n\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden at the Democratic presidential primary debate Sept. 12 in Houston. (David J. Phillip/AP)\n\nBiden fumbled for a moment at the outset.\n\n\u201cWell, they have to deal with the \u2014,\" he said, before resetting and picking a direction: \u201cLook, there\u2019s institutional segregation in this country.\"\n\nHe transitioned into his political record.\n\n\u201cAnd from the time I got involved, I started dealing with that,\u201d he said. \u201cRedlining, banks, making sure that we are in a position where \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRedlining\u201d was a process in which neighborhoods were literally outlined with red to indicate that they were too risky for lenders to issue mortgages. Often, those lines were drawn specifically because the areas were heavily black.\n\nAfter the first Democratic debate, Biden made a similar, more direct assertion to this point. \u201cI did support federal action to address root causes of segregation in our schools and our communities,\u201d he said at an event in July, \u201cincluding taking on the banks and redlining and trying to change the way in which neighborhoods were segregated.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of his similar answer Thursday night, though, Biden reset again. Catching himself in rocky terrain \u2014 this was the general domain where Harris blasted him in June, after all \u2014 he settled back into a place where he felt familiar.\n\n\u201cLook, you talk about education,\u201d he said. \u201cI propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title I schools, triple the amount of money we spend from $15 [billion] to $45 billion a year. Give every single teacher a raise, the equal raise to getting out \u2014 the $60,000 level.\u201d\n\nThis is part of Biden\u2019s education platform, something he\u2019s talked about regularly. That plan also includes a push to double the number of support staff in schools, which Biden talked about next.\n\n\u201cNumber two, make sure that we bring in to help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problems that come from home, we need \u2014 we have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today. It\u2019s crazy.\"\n\nPerhaps without realizing it, Biden was walking back into rough terrain. He'd been asked a question about how the education system could be a tool for addressing the endemic problems of race and was now talking about \u2026 problems kids brought to school from home.\n\nIt got worse.\n\nFirst, Biden reset again, only slightly, mentioning that he had firsthand experience with what teachers experience.\n\n\u201cThe teachers are \u2014 I\u2019m married to a teacher. My deceased wife is a teacher,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cThey have every problem coming to them.\"\n\nHe then went back to the safe terrain of his policy proposals: advocating universal pre-K starting at age 3. \u201cWe have to make sure that every single child does, in fact, have \u2014 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds go to school,\u201d he said. \u201cSchool. Not day care. School.\u201d\n\nAs happened the first time, though, he then continued to explore what his education proposal entails, including more support for parents who need it.\n\n\u201cWe bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help. They don\u2019t \u2014 they don\u2019t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the \u2014 the \u2014 make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school \u2014 a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the record player line, apparently suggesting using an archaic technology to encourage children to listen to and learn words. Hence the line at the end there noting that poor children have less exposure to language, which then starts them in school at a disadvantage. (This, it\u2019s worth mentioning, is disputed.)\n\nAgain, though, this is a problematic place to end up from a question starting with addressing the role of education in racial inequality. There\u2019s certainly a gap in performance that correlates to race as there is one that correlates to income. Income and race are themselves linked. But Biden\u2019s answer here has him suggesting that the way to address a divide that he called institutional is to get black parents to do a better job.\n\nI can say from experience that, faced with an open microphone, you can sometimes discover that you're a ship far out at sea with no discernible route back to shore. One strategy is to keep paddling, saying things and trusting that you'll end up somewhere coherent. Perhaps that's what Biden was doing here, looking for a safe port.\n\nPerhaps it was more troublesome: Biden subconsciously deciding that talking about improving parenting skills was a good answer to a question about \u201crepairing the legacy of slavery in our country\u201d \u2014 that there was a central link between black parenting and the inequalities of our educational system. There was a public debate early in Barack Obama\u2019s second term in office (and Biden\u2019s second as vice president) in which Obama criticized black culture as a barrier to success. If Biden internalized that argument without recognizing why he might not be the best messenger for it, that\u2019s a problem.\n\nThis would be the second time that Biden problematically conflated poverty and race in the context of education. At an event in Iowa last month, Biden said that students needed to be challenged. After all, \u201cpoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\u201d He soon caught himself, but the line understandably attracted attention.\n\nAfter his line about record players on Thursday night, something remarkable in a different way happened. Davis gave him an out, cutting him off with a \u201cthank you.\u201d (Each candidate was given one minute for answers.)\n\nBiden had been criticized for actually stopping when his time was up, which was seen as an admission that he didn't want to say too much. His response to Harris in that first debate, for example, ended with his meekly noting that his time was up and stopping.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Biden said to Davis, rather indignantly. \u201cI\u2019m going to go like the rest of them do, twice over, okay?\"\n\nThe crowd applauded.\n\n\u201cBecause here's the deal. The deal is that we've got this a little backward,\u201d Biden said.\n\nAnd then he started talking about Venezuela.\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, in Venezuela, we should be allowing people to come here from Venezuela. I know Maduro. I\u2019ve confronted Maduro,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNumber two, you talk about the need to do something in Latin America. I\u2019m the guy that came up with $740 million to see to it those three countries, in fact, changed their system so people don\u2019t have a chance to leave. You\u2019re all acting like we just discovered this yesterday.\"\n\nThere\u2019s a reason for this aside, too, sort of. Biden hadn\u2019t been asked a direct question in the debate during segments about Latin America and climate change. This was his way of inserting his thoughts on those subjects \u2014 and highlighting his experience \u2014 once he got the floor.\n\nIt just didn\u2019t really hang together well. Perhaps this was Biden\u2019s way of again resetting, again finding familiar terrain. Davis broke his line of thinking on education (probably to Biden\u2019s benefit), and he then remembered that he\u2019d wanted to make two points: that others ran over the time limit and that he had thoughts about Latin America. The education answer was over, and he got those other two things out of the way.\n\nAnd then he was done.\n\n\u201cThank you very much,\u201d Biden concluded.", "description": "It was a problematic response in a variety of ways.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/opzxNw8pVPTe6ioNyRVMQlmn6eM=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-13-2019/t_17de30f6db544f63a989da8c369571ee_name_biden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
