Here's how. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nIf only I had a nickel for every time I saw someone post on Instagram or say in a coffee shop, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a compostable cup!\u201d I\u2019d be about as overflowing as our landfills. These compostable items are popping up everywhere, ensuring business owners and consumers alike feel good about the disposables they are carrying around. The problem is that there\u2019s a lot of misinformation about bioplastics \u2013 and unfortunately, bioplastics aren't the perfect solution to the problem of plastic people think they are.\n\nMuch like how the recycling movement allowed people to feel OK about buying products in plastic bottles, items made of bioplastics seem environmentally harmless to many consumers. But the life cycle of these products is misrepresented. The biggest challenge? Ensuring bioplastics are disposed of properly. I chatted with sustainability expert and consultant Shannon Kenny, who broke down the challenges with these items.\n\n\u201cAnytime you add the term \u2018bio,\u2019 \u2018compostable\u2019 or \u2018plant-based\u2019 to a product name or description, people automatically think that makes them good for the planet,\" she said. \"But unless you have the proper facilities to process and recycle these bioplastics, they can be just as harmful to the planet as traditional plastics that are made from fossil fuels.\u201d\n\nMuch like how the recycling movement allowed people to feel OK about buying products in plastic bottles, items made of bioplastics seem environmentally harmless to many consumers. (Photo: xmocb, Getty Images)\n\nSO WHAT ARE BIOPLASTICS?\n\nIn order for bioplastic items to break down, they need the perfect storm of gases, heat and airflow that is only provided in a commercial composting facility. And since you probably don\u2019t have commercial composting accessible to you, you may not know what to do with the products.\n\nMore: Greenwashing: What it is & how to pinpoint brands that do it\n\nSince they look like plastic, people often assume they can be recycled, which isn\u2019t true. According to Kenny, \u201cConsumers often dispose of bioplastics in recycling bins, which is like throwing a wrench into an engine \u2014 it messes the whole process up. When bioplastics enter the plastic recycling stream, they\u2019re difficult to identify and separate from the other plastics, which contaminates the entire recycling process and creates a low-grade recycled plastic.\u201d\n\nTHE UPSIDE TO BIOPLASTICS\n\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom for bioplastics, though. One way that bioplastics are more sustainable than their plastic counterparts is their beginning of life \u2014 how the items are created. Bioplastics are engineered out of either polylactic acids (PLAs), made from sugarcane and corn and other plant matter, and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), which are engineered from microorganisms. These materials allow the manufacturers to avoid using fossil fuels. But if the PLA is made from monoculture (when a crop is continuously grown on the same plot of land without other crops) corn, there can be implications for our planet. Monoculture crops deplete the soil and can lead to toxic runoff. Like everything else in sustainability, it\u2019s complicated and layered when it comes to impact.\n\nWHAT SHOULD YOU BE USING?\n\nSo if plastic isn\u2019t great, but bioplastics aren\u2019t either, what should we use?\n\n\u201cIn terms of single-use items, better alternatives would be containers and utensils that are made from actually compostable materials like paper and bamboo. These materials (if not coated in a bioplastic), have a much better chance of breaking down in a natural environment or if they\u2019re disposed of in a home or backyard compost,\u201d Kenny advises. So opt for the paper straw over the compostable plastic one, for example.\n\nAdditionally, Kenny says to look for items that are home compostable instead of commercially compostable. Home compostable options are optimal because it means \u201cthe average consumer can put it in a home compost or even bury it in their backyard and it will break down,\u201d Kenny shared. As we now know, that isn\u2019t true of bioplastics.\n\nWith no great eco-friendly options available, where do we go from here? In the short term, we need to focus on consumer education, ensuring that consumers, as well as business owners, know about how these products really work and their shortcomings.\n\nTHE BIG BIOPLASTICS PICTURE\n\nIn the long run, we need increased access to commercial composting. Kenny explained that municipal composting \u201cshould be as crucial to waste management systems as landfills currently are, especially since they would majorly decrease the need for the enormous landfills currently needed for waste management.\u201d This would mean composting pick-up from outside your home and availability of composting bins for you to toss your compostable coffee cup into.\n\nMore: Your fear of recycling is common, according to psychology\n\nThe most sustainable solution in both the short term and the long run, though, is to avoid disposables and single-use items. Even if they are properly composted or disposed of, the resources and energy required inevitably take a toll on the environment. The best option is to bring your own cup to the coffee shop and your own cutlery to the office to eat your salad or out to dinner at your favorite fast-casual restaurant. Say no to straws. And educate others \u2014 friends, family, and even your local coffee shop or restaurant owners \u2014 that these bioplastics aren\u2019t as \u201cgreen\u201d as they may appear.\n\nDecrease your plastic use even more with this macrame reusable bag.
