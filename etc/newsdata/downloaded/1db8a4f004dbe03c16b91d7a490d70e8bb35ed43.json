(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nTim O\u2019Brien, a Trump biographer and executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion, said the Alabama claims underscore the president\u2019s belief that admitting error is a sign of weakness.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doubling down on the worst sides of his troubled personality \u2014 to never admit an error and to continue obsessing about it, and emphasizing it, when it doesn\u2019t serve him well to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t move along because he is incapable of moving along.\u201d\n\nTrump, who canceled a trip to Poland to monitor the storm, was especially sensitive to the criticism he has received for misrepresenting the hurricane\u2019s path, according to current and former officials.\n\n\u201cAlways good to be prepared! But the Fake News is only interested in demeaning and belittling,\u201d Trump tweeted Monday, complaining about an ABC News report that highlighted the discrepancy between Trump\u2019s warnings to Alabama and the government\u2019s assurance that the state was not under threat.\n\n\u201cWhat I said was accurate! All Fake News in order to demean!\u201d Trump tweeted Thursday, adding: \u201cI accept the Fake News apologies!\u201d\n\nTrump, who has privately and publicly griped about media coverage during the Group of 7 summit last month, complained extensively to administration officials this week about coverage of the Alabama issue and asked aides to bring him old briefings showing Alabama in the storm\u2019s potential path. Even as the Category 2 hurricane knocked out power and damaged property in the Carolinas on Thursday, Trump was highlighting old maps in an attempt to prove that his original claims about Alabama were accurate.\n\nThe White House also released a lengthy statement from Trump\u2019s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, Rear Adm. Peter Brown, that sought to defend Trump\u2019s statements and his use of days-old maps.\n\n\u201cWhile speaking to the press on Sunday, September 1, the President addressed Hurricane Dorian and its potential impact on multiple states, including Alabama,\u201d Brown wrote. \u201cThe President\u2019s comments were based on that morning\u2019s Hurricane Dorian briefing, which included the possibility of tropical storm force winds in southeastern Alabama.\u201d\n\nIt was Trump who used a black Sharpie to mark up an official National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration map, which he displayed during an Oval Office briefing on Wednesday, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\n\u201cNo one else writes like that on a map with a black Sharpie,\u201d the official said of the map, which added Alabama into the hurricane\u2019s potential pathway inside the loop of the marker.\n\nSeveral White House officials argued that media coverage of the Alabama issue has been unfair to Trump, but one senior administration official said that \u201cas long as it\u2019s in the news, he is not going to drop it.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was President Trump who used a black Sharpie to mark up an official National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration map, according to a White House official. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nTrump has recently fixated on minor points of grievance that aides and Republican lawmakers would prefer he avoid, such as former aide Anthony Scaramucci, actress Debra Messing and an Axios story that said he proposed bombing hurricanes to stop their progress.\n\nOn Sunday, after a weekend spent at Camp David with afternoons at his Virginia golf course, Trump warned multiple times that Alabama was likely to be hit. But the storm had already turned northward at that point, and models from the National Hurricane Center did not show Alabama at any significant risk.\n\nTwenty minutes after Trump tweeted Sunday that Alabama was among states that would \u201cmost likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated,\u201d the National Weather Service in Birmingham, Ala., tweeted bluntly that was not the case.\n\n\u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama,\u201d it said. \u201cThe system will remain too far east.\u201d\n\nJust a few minutes later, the president spoke to reporters and again claimed that Alabama was \u201cgoing to get a piece of it.\u201d\n\nBrown, who joined the White House National Security Council from the Coast Guard, had been assigned to give weekend updates to Trump on the storm.\n\n\u201cWe spent two days at Camp David going over a lot of different things having to do with the hurricane,\u201d Trump said of Brown. \u201cThe admiral has informed me through all of the different sources that he has \u2014 but you can pretty much get it on television, admiral \u2014 this is now a Category 5.\u201d\n\nAn NSC spokesman did not respond to questions about whether Brown had briefed the president about updated forecasts over the weekend that showed Alabama in the clear.\n\nBrown said in his statement Thursday that he had briefed Trump on the hurricane Sunday morning using forecasts from the National Hurricane Center that showed a remote possibility of tropical-storm winds in a southeast corner of Alabama. He said he also briefed Trump using other meteorological models.\n\n\u201cThese products showed possible storm impacts well outside the official forecast cone,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump speaks at the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Sunday next to acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nDuring a briefing at FEMA headquarters on Sunday afternoon, Trump acknowledged governors who had dialed in from Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. He then turned to a state that wasn\u2019t represented on the line.\n\n\u201cIt may get a little piece of a great place: It\u2019s called Alabama,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd Alabama could even be in for at least some very strong winds and something more than that, it could be. This just came up, unfortunately. It\u2019s the size of the storm that we\u2019re talking about. So, for Alabama, just please be careful also.\u201d\n\nMaps tweeted out by Trump on Thursday showed part of southeastern Alabama with a 5 to 20 percent chance of tropical-storm-force winds \u2014 a week-old forecast that was long out of date by the time the president tweeted out his warnings to the state Sunday.\n\nTrump claimed Wednesday that Alabama had faced a 95 percent chance of a direct hit, a claim not borne out by meteorological models.\n\nSome Democrats criticized Trump for focusing on the wrong thing during a natural disaster.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president, said on CNN Thursday that he felt \u201csorry for the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he felt it necessary to pull out a Sharpie and change the map, I don\u2019t know if one of his aides felt they had to do that to protect his ego,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter how you cut it, this is an unbelievably sad state of affairs for our country.\u201d\n\nAndrew Freedman and Jason Samenow contributed to this report.", "description": "For a fourth straight day, Trump\u2019s White House sought to clean up the president\u2019s mistaken warnings to Alabama, releasing statements, disseminating alternative hurricane maps and attacking the media.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3aLCr4yI-q4f7eSQ2WxQRNoXz3c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RTOCIMWPHII6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
