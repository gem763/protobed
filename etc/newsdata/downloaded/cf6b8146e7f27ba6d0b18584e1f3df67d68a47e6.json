The proposed bill would have allowed people in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China for trial. Despite Lam's suspension of the bill in June, protesters continued to rally. On Sunday, the city saw its most violent day since mass protests first broke out earlier this year.\n\nThe bill can only be fully withdrawn after the parliament resumes in the fall.\n\nLam said on Wednesday that the government had responded to each of the demands but admitted that it \"may not be able to address all the grievances of people in society.\" She then called for dialogue rather than further violence.", "description": "A full withdrawal of the contentious bill is one of five demands that protesters have been fighting for.", "authors": ["Grace Shao"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106111247-1567604895920gettyimages-1172171023.jpeg?v=1567604994"}
