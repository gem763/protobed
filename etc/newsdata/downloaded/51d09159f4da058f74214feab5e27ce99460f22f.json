Responding for him, Simpson\u2019s lawyer, Joshua Levy, blurted out a surprising warning: \u201cSomebody\u2019s already been killed as a result of the publication of this dossier.\u201d\n\nIn his subsequent November testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, which was made available last Thursday, Simpson denied knowing specific cases of people being killed because of the dossier, but he then noted cryptically that \u201cpeople literally risked their lives to tell us some of this stuff.\u201d\n\nIn fact, there is evidence that at least one Russian was murdered because of Steele\u2019s revelations: Gen. Oleg Erovinkin of Russia\u2019s State Security Service (FSB). On the morning of Dec. 26, 2016, Erovinkin, age 61, was found dead in his car in central Moscow. Life News, known to be a Kremlin mouthpiece, first claimed on its website that Erovinkin had been \u201ckilled,\u201d but then quickly changed its story, saying simply that Erovinkin had \u201cdied.\u201d FSB investigators were called immediately to the death scene, and news outlets soon reported that Erovinkin had succumbed to a heart attack. There was no more official Russian mention of him.\n\nErovinkin, who joined the KGB (the FSB\u2019s predecessor) in 1976, had in the mid-1990s worked in the Russian Presidential Administration, where his job was to monitor compliance with security procedures. (He was known as \u201cthe keeper of the Kremlin\u2019s secrets.\u201d) He then served under Igor Sechin when the latter was deputy premier and subsequently followed Sechin to Rosneft in 2012, after Sechin became CEO of the state oil giant.\n\nOf all the officials who serve under Putin, Sechin is the most powerful. Erovinkin, as chief administrator at Rosneft, was Sechin\u2019s right-hand man and must have known everything about Sechin\u2019s contacts with Americans. Those included the former head of ExxonMobil, now Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. (Sechin once said he felt thwarted by U.S.-imposed sanctions that kept him from riding motorcycles in America with his friend Tillerson.)\n\nMore importantly, in terms of allegations made by the Steele dossier and currently the focus of multiple investigations in Washington, Erovinkin was in a position to keep track of contacts with Trump advisers in considerable detail.\n\n\u201c Erovinkin was known as 'the keeper of the Kremlin\u2019s secrets.' \u201d\n\nSteele wrote in his dossier that \u201ca Russian source close to Rosneft President [sic] Igor Sechin\u201d had confided details of a secret July 2016 meeting in Moscow between Sechin and Trump foreign-policy adviser Carter Page. The two had allegedly discussed bilateral energy cooperation between the United States and Russia, along with the lifting of Ukraine-related economic sanctions against Russia. As a quid pro quo, Sechin was said to have offered Page and his associates the brokerage of a 19 percent stake in Rosneft, which was due to be privatized. Page reportedly indicated that Trump, if elected president, would lift sanctions.\n\nKnown to be sympathetic to the Kremlin, Page was apparently viewed by the Russian security services as a key object for advancing their interests with Trump. (In 2013, an agent from the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, SVR, met Page in New York City and engaged in several communications with him as part of a recruitment attempt.)\n\nThe Steele dossier mentions that Page also met on this same Moscow trip with Igor Diveikin, an FSB colonel who was at the time a senior official in the Internal Political Department of the Russian Presidential Administration. Diveikin, who had previously served in the Presidential Security Service, the agency with the crucial responsibility of guarding the Russian president, reportedly told Page about compromising material the Russians had on Hillary Clinton and also conveyed to Page that the Kremlin had kompromat on Trump, which Trump should consider in his dealings with Russia.\n\nWhen questioned by the House Intelligence Committee in November, Page denied knowing either Sechin or Diveikin. But he also claimed that he met with no senior Russian officials while he was in Moscow in July 2016, and that turned out to be untrue.\n\nAfter Rep. Adam Schiff reminded Page of his July 8, 2016, email from Moscow to members of the Trump campaign saying that he had received \u201cincredible insights and outreach\u201d from senior members of Putin\u2019s administration, Page backtracked. He reluctantly admitted meeting with Russian vice premier Arkady Dvorkovich and also with Andrei Baranov, who is head of investor relations at Rosneft, a top management position that would put Baranov in frequent contact with Sechin. (Significantly, Baranov was awarded a medal \u201cfor service to his country\u201d by Putin in March 2017.)\n\nAfter insisting to the committee that he and Baranov only got together because they were old friends, Page was forced to acknowledge that the two may have discussed sanctions and also the potential sale of Rosneft\u2019s stock, which makes one wonder whether Sechin was at the meeting as well.\n\nThe plan to privatize part of Rosneft was not known outside of Rosneft\u2019s top management at this time and it was a contentious issue, as was the proposed purchase by Rosneft of controlling shares in the oil company Bashneft, which occurred in October. (The sale of 19.5 percent of Rosneft shares to Qatar and the commodities giant Glencore was announced in early December.)\n\nAll of these negotiations were fraught, and the subject of high-level infighting among senior Russian officials.\n\nOne who initially opposed both of these transactions was Minister of Economic Development Aleksei Ulyukaev, who was arrested in November 2016 on charges of taking a $2 million bribe from Sechin. It was a classic sting operation, with Sechin in charge, and after a sensational trial Ulyukaev was sentenced in December to eight years in a strict regime labor camp. Sechin had been called to appear as a witness, but refused. In his stead, Page\u2019s friend Baranov appeared to testify against Ulyukaev.\n\nErovinkin would have known about all these intrigues in great detail, and thus could have exposed not only links to the Trump campaign, but internal corruption\u2014all of which would put him in danger if he were thought to be leaking information.\n\nAccording to the recent book by British journalist Luke Harding, Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win, Steele denied that Erovinkin was a direct source for his report. But, as Harding told me recently, the information could nonetheless have originated with Erovinkin. (Steele refers to \"a senior member of Sechin's staff\" as confirming the Sechin-Page meeting to his source.) And even it did not come from Erovinkin, he would have borne responsibility for the leaks, since he was the head of Rosneft\u2019s administration, with security part of his purview. The fatal question ultimately is not what he did, but what he was thought to have done.\n\nWhile the Ulyukaev case and the Rosneft transactions certainly contribute to the air of conspiracy around Erovinkin\u2019s death, it is more than likely that the Steele dossier did him in.\n\nAlthough the dossier was not published on the web until two weeks after Erovinkin died, the Kremlin was doubtless aware of its contents well before this. Simpson had conveyed much of the material to American journalists in the autumn of 2016, and, according to the Harding book: \u201cFor months, reporters on the national security beat and Moscow correspondents had been working feverishly to substantiate the allegations.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the arrests in December of high-level FSB officers responsible for cyber operations were widely assumed to be set off by Steele\u2019s revelations that the Trump campaign had colluded in the Russian cyber attacks against the Clinton campaign that were revealed by U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nHowever much Trump\u2019s defenders want to dismiss the dossier as a fake concocted by the president\u2019s enemies, the fallout from it in Russia, including at least one highly probable murder, suggests that much of what Steele reported is fact.", "description": "The notorious dossier on Trump that Republicans want to discredit may well have been credible enough in Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s eyes to get at least one person killed.", "authors": ["Amy Knight"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1516665658/180122-knight-russian-murder-lede_oglmd6", "published_at": "2018-01-23"}
