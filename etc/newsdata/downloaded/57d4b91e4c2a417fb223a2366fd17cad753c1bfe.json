Turki al-Maliki, spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen, told reporters in Riyadh on Wednesday.\n\nHe said Saudi Arabia made its judgment based on the direction of the cruise missiles when they struck the facilities and the maximum distance of 435 miles they could travel. The weapons found at the two attack sites also could be traced back to Iran, he said.\n\nRelated Video Fears of a military conflict between the U.S. and Iran are high following an attack on a critical Saudi oil facility Saturday.

Maliki displayed debris from the attacks, including what the Ministry of Defense described as Iranian drones and cruise missiles. He said Saudi Arabia was still working to determine the launch site and didn\u2019t explicitly say the attacks had been mounted by Iran or from Iranian territory.\n\nThe ministry on Wednesday also displayed debris from what it said was an earlier attack on an oil facility in Afif in May.\n\nCol. Maliki said the ministry knew the range of the cruise missiles, which he said were Iranian-made Ya Ali land-attack missiles, based on its military assessments and the range of previous attacks.\n\nCruise missiles have vastly different ranges, with some traveling a couple hundred miles while the U.S.-made Tomahawk missile has a range of more than 1,000 miles. Iran\u2019s Tasnim News Agency, affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in 2015 quoted then-Deputy Defense Minister Mohammad Eslami as saying the Ya Ali outstripped other Iranian cruise missiles with a range of 435 miles.\n\nSaudi Arabia has largely faced ballistic-missile attacks. Col. Maliki said about 230 ballistic missiles had been fired on the kingdom in recent years, demonstrating the strength of Saudi aerial-defense systems.\n\nThe Saudi claims escalate tensions in the region, although Col. Maliki didn\u2019t say whether or how the kingdom would respond against Iran.\n\nFiring Range Saudi Arabia estimates the range of the missiles that targeted its oil facilities is 435 miles. The range would exclude Yemen, where Iran says Houthi rebels conducted the strikes, as a launch point.

It called on the international community to hold Iran responsible for its aggressive posture in the region.\n\n\u201cThis attack was not against Aramco or Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an assault on the international community.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump said on Twitter on Wednesday that he has ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to \u201csubstantially increase\u201d sanctions on Iran in the wake of the attacks on Saudi oil facilities.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump didn\u2019t directly link Iran to Saturday\u2019s attacks in his tweet, he said this week that it was \u201ccertainly looking\u201d like Iran was responsible.\n\nLater, in comments to reporters in California, Mr. Trump said further details on sanctions would be released in the next 48 hours and he is looking at various other options in responding to the strike.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the ultimate option and there are options a lot less than that,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. officials say they are waiting for the results of an investigation by the Saudi government before proceeding.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo was more explicit than Mr. Trump in blaming Iran. Landing in Jeddah ahead of a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the U.S. diplomat said Iran had conducted the attack, not its Yemeni proxy, known as the Houthis.\n\n\u201cThe intelligence community has high confidence that\u2026these were not weapons that would have been in the possession of the Houthis,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said. Additionally, the flight patterns required to have inflicted the level of damage to the Saudi facilities rule out Yemen as a point of origin, he added.\n\nMr. Pompeo called the attack an act of war. \u201cWe\u2019re blessed that there were no Americans killed in this attack, but any time you have an act of war of this nature, there\u2019s always risk that that could happen.\u201d\n\nTehran on Wednesday continued to say Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen were behind the strikes on the Aramco facilities. President Hassan Rouhani after a cabinet meeting in Tehran told state media that the U.S. was falsely accusing Iran of the attack to pressure it. The attack was a warning from the Houthis to Saudi Arabia, which has been waging a bloody war against the rebels for nearly five years, he said.\n\nAddressing Saudi Arabia, Mr. Rouhani added: \u201cLearn lessons from this warning and consider that there could be a war in the region.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s twin attacks on the Abqaiq and Khurais oil facilities knocked out 5.7 million barrels a day of production at Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, sending global oil prices higher.\n\nOn Tuesday, Saudi officials said they would use reserves to return production to normal levels within weeks and had restored 50% of lost output.\n\nThe price of Brent crude\u2014the global benchmark\u2014jumped 15% to $69.02 a barrel on Monday, its largest one-day climb since 1988. It was trading at $64.44 a barrel on Wednesday.\n\nSome Saudi officials were skeptical of the defense ministry\u2019s claims of aerial robustness. The strikes demonstrated a vulnerability in Saudi Arabia\u2019s overstretched air systems, which have been taxed by months of attacks throughout the country, said the officials, who weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media.\n\n\u201cThey hit us where we are weak,\u201d one Saudi official said.\n\nThe kingdom\u2019s air defenses never had a chance to activate because neither Saudi nor American systems detected the launch of the airstrike on Saturday morning, U.S. officials said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Saudi government recently moved the position of some air-defense systems, Saudi officials said, in order to cope with recent strikes that have hit airports, oil installations, and a desalination plant. Houthi rebels claimed the bombings.\n\nThe failure of Saudi and American air defenses to stop Saturday\u2019s attack has raised alarms about the security of facilities that are a key component of the world\u2019s oil supply. The combination of cruise missiles and drones represents a complex attack that would have challenged even the most sophisticated air-defense systems in the world, experts said.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the attack was very carefully and thoroughly planned and that great care was taken to construct the attack plan in such a way to evade the air defenses that the Saudis are known to have,\u201d said Bradley Boyer, a defense and energy analyst and retired U.S. Navy intelligence officer.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s air defenses include the American Patriot and Hawk missile systems, which are better suited to shoot down mid- and long-range ballistic missiles, rather than the lighter and lower-flying cruise missiles and drones used in Saturday\u2019s attack. The country also possesses short-range defense systems.\n\nSaudi Arabia has a mixed record in defending itself from missile attacks. In one well-documented case, the country activated its Patriot missile defenses during an attack on the Riyadh airport in November 2017. The government said it shot down the incoming missile. Video footage and other evidence showed the defenses fell short of their targets.\n\n\u2014Vivian Salama, Ian Talley, Sune Engel Rasmussen and Courtney McBride\n\ncontributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com, Jared Malsin at jared.malsin@wsj.com and Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com", "description": "Military officials stopped short of explicitly accusing Tehran of conducting the strikes.", "authors": ["Rory Jones In Riyadh", "Saudi Arabia", "Jared Malsin In Cairo", "Summer Said In Dubai", "Rory Jones", "Jared Malsin", "Summer Said", "Rory.Jones Wsj.Com", "Jared.Malsin Wsj.Com", "Summer.Said Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108218/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
