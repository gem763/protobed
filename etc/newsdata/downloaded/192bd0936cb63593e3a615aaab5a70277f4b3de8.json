He had an operation on the same knee in March to repair ligament damage, an injury he suffered while still an Atl\u00e9tico Madrid player.\n\nBayern said it informed the French federation on Saturday that Hern\u00e1ndez could not play in the team\u2019s upcoming European qualifiers against Iceland and Turkey, but that it received a reply Monday that the player was expected to return to France nonetheless, in line with FIFA statutes.\n\n\u201cOf the four French players demanded, of course we\u2019re making three healthy professionals in Kingsley Coman, Corentin Tolisso and Benjamin Pavard available as per FIFA statutes, but we expected more understanding over Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez due to the risk involved - like the German soccer federation is showing with the injury-induced dropouts of Toni Kroos, Jonas Hector and others,\u201d Rummenigge said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bayern Munich has criticized the French soccer federation for requiring injured defender Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez to come to Paris for a doctor's exam during the international break.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
