Associated Press\n\nGun rights activists are now testing if the policy is able to be enforced, accusing Walmart of trying to appease people who want greater gun control measures while not making any real changes to what customers can do.\n\nDavid Amad, the vice president of Open Carry Texas, told The New York Times that many of his group's 38,000 members had openly carried their guns into Walmart stores and that none were asked to leave.\n\n\"They are ducking the issue,\" he told the Times.\n\n\"They are trying to get the gun haters to leave them alone, while at the same time leave us alone when we carry in their stores.\"\n\nJoseph Barbarito holds a sign as he waits for protesters to deliver a petition signed by around 300,000 people to Walmart calling on the retailer to stop selling assault weapons and munitions in 2013. REUTERS/ Michelle McLoughlin\n\nLorenzo Lopez, a Walmart spokesman, told the Times that he was not aware of more customers openly carrying guns in the company's' stores since the policy was announced, and said employees should call the police if either they or a customer feels unsafe.\n\nRead more: I tried to buy a gun at Walmart twice, and roadblocks left me empty-handed both times\n\nWalmart also announced that it was ending the sale of some forms of ammunition, though it would continue to sell its rifles and shotguns. The company stopped selling assault-style semi-automatic rifles in 2015, blaming a lack of demand.\n\n\"We know these decisions will inconvenience some of our customers, and we hope they will understand,\" McMillon said. \"As a company, we experienced two horrific events in one week, and we will never be the same.\"\n\nHe also said that he had written to lawmakers to encourage debate around stronger gun control.\n\nThe policy was an about-face for the company, which had said a week after the shootings that it had no plans to change its policies.\n\nWalmart's decision set off a tide of retailers asking customers not to open carry in their stores\n\nTwo other major retailers announced on Tuesday that they would also ask customers to not openly carry in stores, joining a growing number of retailers that have started to make the request from customers but are not announcing an enforced ban.\n\nAldi USA said it would ask customers not to carry weapons in its stores, citing \"the safety of our employees, customers and the community.\"\n\n\"Alongside many other businesses, we are asking that our customers refrain from openly displaying firearms in any of our stores, except for authorized law enforcement personnel,\" a statement said.\n\nRead more: Walmart workers grapple with heightened fears in the aftermath of deadly shootings\n\nMeijer, a chain in the Midwest, also joined in, saying: \"The safety of our customers and team members is our top priority, so we respectfully request that our customers do not open carry firearms at Meijer.\n\n\"We've made this decision because open carry can create an environment that makes our customers and team members feel unsafe.\"\n\nAn Aldi store.

That does not apply to gun owners.\"", "description": "Aldi and Meijer announced that they are asking customers not to open carry in stores, joining CVS, Walgreens, and Kroger in following Walmart's lead.", "authors": ["Sin\u00e9ad Baker"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d78c63a2e22af20a2540bf6-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
