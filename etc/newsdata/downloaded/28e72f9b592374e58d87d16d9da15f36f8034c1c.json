But he has made clear his aim of breaking back into the first team.\n\n\u201cObviously it's been a while for me, so it's nice to be back out there,\u201d Gomez told the Liverpool Echo. \u201cThe competition gave a lot of us the chance to play and get out on the pitch, so it was a good night. It was nice to get a win and a clean sheet.\n\n\u201cI want to be playing, every football player wants to be playing, but at the same time, I understand that we're European champions, I am at a top club and the lads are doing very well at the minute. All I can do is keep my head down, work hard in training and wait for the right time but I've just got to keep it up right now.\n\n\u201cCredit to [Van Dijk and Matip], they are doing unbelievably well, so I understand, but obviously it is frustrating for me at the same time. It is what it is. I've got to keep working hard and keep pushing on.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nWho caught Klopp\u2019s eye in Liverpool win over MK Dons?\n\nGomez reiterated that he can do nothing more than impress in training and hope he is rewarded with more opportunities to play.\n\n\u201cYou can't rest on your laurels and sit there and be down about it,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have got to be there every day in training and keep positive because you want to do yourself justice when the time comes.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIf you don't put in the same practice every day in training with the same attitude you are only doing yourself harm when it comes to your time to play, so I have just got to keep doing that every day, keep working. I've got a great set of lads to learn from.\n\n\u201cObviously Virgil and Joel, me and Dej (Dejan Lovren) keep pushing each other as well. It is part of being at Liverpool.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Who caught Klopp\u2019s eye in Liverpool win over MK Dons?", "description": "Liverpool defender Joe Gomez has spoken of his frustration having lost his place in Jurgen Klopp\u2019s starting XI to Joel Matip.The 22-year-old was a regular at the start of last season but was kept out of action for four months when he broke his leg during a game at Burnley.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9JmBF6J2G1VlmULlauByBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNTI7aD03ODY-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/brwALymECvPTkG1AAJ0b_Q--~B/aD0zOTM7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/bfc4344a12aa37ff448b4d5c31ea475a", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
