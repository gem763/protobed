He\u2019s hilarious. He ripped Jussie Smollett and his hate crime hoax that sent the whole nation into a Trump-hating frenzy. In the end, two Nigerian brothers staged the hoax. The Windy City devoted countless hours and resources to this circus act\u2014and while the national media thought this was an actual story, local news did its job, reported on the facts, and revealed it to be a fraud. Barkley\u2019s commentary during a halftime show for TNT\u2019s coverage only showed that it was now a national punchline.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet, when it comes to politics, Barkley, an Alabama native, threw his support behind Democrat Doug Jones for U.S. Senate in the state\u2019s special election. Yet, he torched Democrats for pretty much exploiting black voters, only reaching out during election year and then doing jack when they\u2019re ushered into power. Barkley made these remarks in an interview with Sirius XM\u2019s Michael Smerconish.\n\nHe also said Republicans need to start doing outreach since they really don\u2019t it at all with minority communities. That has changed in recent years, especially with former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan\u2019s agenda of fighting poverty, but it could be better. On school choice especially is one area where the GOP can make inroad not just with black communities, but the urban areas. It\u2019s a win-win issue across the board.\n\nThe former NBA star might give liberals heartburn when he said that not all Trump voters are racist, though he admits that some are. Yes, and there are probably some racists who voted for the Democratic Party last year as well. In fact, the Ku Klux Klan backed Democrats throughout the Reconstruction and Jim Crow era. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t make it the party of the KKK, though when Democrats try to make it seem as if the GOP is\u2014that\u2019s when you hit them over the head with this history lesson. So, in short, Barkley ripped everyone. That\u2019s fair. I think you\u2019ll find a lot of Americans who think both parties suck (via Daily Wire):\n\nOn Wednesday, speaking on Michael Smerconish\u2019s SiriusXM radio show, NBA Hall Of Famer Charles Barkley, in his inimitably blunt style, said Democrats only talk to black Americans when they want their votes. [\u2026] Barkley recalled, \"I said 'Doug, I\u2019m going to support you. I\u2019m going to try to get every black person in Alabama to vote for you.' And it worked out. We won for the first time in 40 years. But I said, 'We need to start holding you Democrats accountable' because they\u2019ve been taking black people\u2019s votes \u2013 and they only talk to black people every four years. All of these politicians only talk to black people every four years because they want their vote.\" Barkley added, \"Oh, actually, the Republicans don\u2019t, the Democrats do. But when they get elected, they do nothing in the four years in-between.\" Barkley also opined on the supposed racism of Trump supporters, saying, \"I don\u2019t think everybody who voted for Trump is racist \u2026 I think some of them are, but I don\u2019t think everybody who voted for Trump is racist.\n\nDoes this mean Charles is canceled now?", "description": ".09/21/2019 20:20:45PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/31/b993dbc1-fbaa-44d4-8dc9-656780ebadb3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
