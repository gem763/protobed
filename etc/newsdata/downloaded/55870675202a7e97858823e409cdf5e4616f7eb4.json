Umpire Nacho Forcadell gave him a warning for ball abuse. Then, when Federer flipped a second ball out of court in his next service game, Forcadell had a choice to make. He opted to apply the letter of the law, much to Federer\u2019s displeasure.\n\nFederer had already been tetchy with Forcadell before the penalty was applied, complaining that he had not been informed about a change of balls. Then, when the point was docked, he stood and argued for the best part of a minute, suggesting that there should have been more communication beforehand.\n\nThe row continued at the next changeover. Federer was clearly stung by the decision, and played his most aggressive tennis of the set in the immediate aftermath. But Zverev \u2013 who recently joined Federer\u2019s management agency Team8 \u2013 landed 16 out of 19 first serves in that deciding set, at around 135mph apiece. He held his nerve to clinch a 6-3, 6-7, 6-3 victory on his sixth match point.", "description": "A dramatic day of tennis in Shanghai saw Roger Federer receive a rare point penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct as he went down to a three-set defeat at the hands of Germany\u2019s Alexander Zverev.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212716568-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqulmngyk1nEPNRM5Qu5tZfgiqWHVks1LEZHlCl1t38PI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
