Despite growing up right outside of Los Angeles, the 23-year-old musician was raised without a television and received her pop culture education by way of the radio. Sedona cites her upbringing as a major inspiration for her approach to creating, which led her to The New School in New York in pursuit of her own musical career.\n\n\u201cBoth of my parents are musicians and I grew up in a place where you don\u2019t have a choice to be anything other than yourself. I try to share that idea through my music and my existence,\u201d Sedona tells i-D. And it\u2019s easy to believe her, given she\u2019s wearing baby doll heads as earrings in the least menacing way possible.\n\nThe now Brooklyn-based artist wrote her newest single, \u201cMore Love,\u201d alongside producers Guv+Price and the synth-driven party-pop anthem is all about the thrill of the chase. \u201cEven if it takes all night boy/ I\u2019m gonna make you mine no use in fighting,\u201d she sings. Shot in LA, the single\u2019s music video leans seductively into Sedona\u2019s 80s influences with its vibrant coloring and styling throughout.\n\nThough she\u2019s proven herself to be quite the director with the music video for her single \u201cCall Me Up,\u201d she created this new video with the help of director Amal\u00eda Irons and production designer Wesley Goodrich. In it, she celebrates the freedom love can give people to explore different sides of themselves by dressing up as characters from popular sexual fantasies: the naughty nurse, the appropriately greasy mechanic, and of course, the sexy librarian. We met with Sedona over tea and empanadas in her Bushwick apartment to talk about \u201cMore Love,\u201d femme empowerment, and even her own sexual fantasies.\n\nWhat is the story behind the name Sedona?\n\nSedona is a place in Arizona that is said to have healing powers in the land, which is something I have always connected to\u2014in terms of nature being a place of healing. It\u2019s also my earliest memory, and the only memory I have from when my parents were still together. They divorced when I was really young. It\u2019s a little bittersweet and I think music is a good outlet to express the complexity of that range of emotions. Sedona represents a force of nature that deals with healing, mourning, loss, and transitioning into something new.\n\nWhat would you say is the core message of your newest track \u201cMore Love?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s definitely an 80s pop banger, but underneath the production\u2014in terms of the lyrics\u2014it encompasses the different sides of the coin that love has to it. It\u2019s about the thrill of the chase, but it\u2019s also about the fact that love can be deep or it can be shallow. It can be very fast and it can be very slow. Each relationship is so different.\n\nThe song is about this concept of love that everyone seems to sing about and the majority of songs are written about. And I am trying to show both sides of the coin in a kitschy, almost poking fun at it kind of way. It has a self-voyeuristic aspect of like \"I\u2019m this cute girl who is going to seduce you tonight and I am going to hypnotize you into this world of music.\"\n\nPhoto by Wesley Goodrich.\n\nAll of your videos are comprised of either a majority or a completely femme cast and crew. What is the driving force behind that decision and how do you think it impacts the process and the final product?\n\nI don\u2019t know what it is, but I just feel like both the music and film industry are so male-dominated and so far every song I have released has been recorded with male producers. I wanted to make an effort to balance that out with the music videos. I feel like women aren\u2019t always taken as seriously in this space. I just know that I have so many insanely creative femme friends and I wanted to bring them together to make art. The sets have been a very nurturing environment and everything has been very collaborative and supportive.\n\nIt\u2019s also just a personal preference. I have an all-girl band and I enjoy the way we work together. It feels like a more natural way of self-expression for Sedona as a band. I\u2019m lucky to be surrounded by amazing creatives no matter how they identify. I just really enjoy working with people who are in touch with their femininity.\n\nPhoto by Wesley Goodrich.\n\nWho all is in your all-girl band and what made you decide to move in that direction?\n\nMargaux Bouchegnies plays bass, Tia Cestaro on drums, Merilyn Chang plays keys, and Claire Gilb is on guitar. We wrote half of the songs on the EP that we are putting out in 2020 together and it\u2019s so different from just working one-on-one with a producer. They\u2019re also my best friends. I hang out with them all the time. I\u2019m an only child and I feel like ever since I came out of the womb I\u2019ve been like, \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d I\u2019ve always been drawn to being around other people. Plus, who wouldn\u2019t want to play shows and tour with their best friends? The soul of Sedona is ever-expanding and in such a sweet way. I have so many friends who have helped bring Sedona to life\u2014especially the band.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about the \u201cMore Love\u201d music video. What was your inspiration and what was the process of filming like for this video?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to be a woman. There are a lot of expectations of what we are supposed to look like and how we are supposed to act. There is this pressure to be a super thin, botox-infused, sex doll cyber-influencer. That was so extreme, but I\u2019m bringing it to the extremes! Some days I want to wear a pretty dress and other days I want to wear my dad\u2019s oversized Levi\u2019s jeans. I wanted to explore that in a way that made fun of sexual fantasy roles. I even played off of my own sexual fantasies of having sex in a library\u2014where you\u2019re supposed to be quiet\u2014or having sex in a dirty mechanic\u2019s garage, the doctor\u2019s office, or a heart-shaped tub. We drew a lot of inspiration from 80s porn, which is funny since I grew up in Chatsworth, California a.k.a. the porn capital of the world.\n\nMy good friend from back home Amal\u00eda Irons directed it. Then Wesley Goodrich spearheaded everything else. She did the art and production design. We wanted to play off of the idea of sexual fantasies and escaping your identity because I think that\u2019s what love does. If you\u2019re in a good thing, whether it\u2019s a fling or a long-term relationship, you\u2019re allowed to be different characters and explore different sides of yourself. I wanted to portray that idea in the video.\n\nPhoto by Wesley Goodrich.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Sedona?\n\nWell, I have an EP coming out in 2020 and it\u2019s a little bit of a deeper take on who I am as an artist. It\u2019s a darker tone of my self-expression both in the lyrical matter and in the production. It\u2019s moodier. I\u2019m still figuring out my sound, and each song I have made so far has been with a different producer, so I\u2019m excited to share songs that I have written with the band because I think we write our best songs together. I even worked with Barrie on one of the songs for the EP.\n\nI learned a lot from collaborating with friends and lovers on this project. I just feel so grateful to be a part of a community that is really the heart and soul of Sedona. It is a force of nature. I\u2019m Sedona. You\u2019re Sedona. We are all Sedona. It\u2019s bigger than just me. I might be the physical embodiment of it, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t extend across the world to people who listen in Brazil or my friends in California who worked so hard on the video.", "description": "Her new video is a lesson in femme empowerment, a kitschy depiction of romance, and an homage to 80s porn.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db0b5c8507a690092fa29ee/lede/1571862048125-Copy-of-Librarian-2-by-Wesley-Goodrich.jpeg?crop=0.7888xw:0.5668xh;0.1232xw,0.0973xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
