It conjures a vivid and unnerving portrait of a work-world that throbs with stress.\n\nWhen you get your fix in gambling, it's the moment you want to last. - St\u00e9phane Larue\n\nLarue found that writing the novel helped him handle the high-octane lifestyle of the service industry, where he still works. \"My writing helps me cope with what would render my life meaningless because I am drinking and partying,\" \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bhe told The Sunday Edition's host Michael Enright.\n\nLarue's anonymous narrator is barely out of his teens. He's a newbie in the restaurant biz, and he scrambles to adapt to the organized chaos of a kitchen. And he wrestles with a gambling addiction \u2014 as did Larue.\n\n\"When you get your fix in gambling, it's the moment you want to last,\" he said.\n\nLarue found that writing down his experiences helped him to exorcise his own demons. \"Sometimes in fiction you hide much less from yourself than in reality,\" he said. \"Fiction allows you to stop protecting yourself while writing.\"\n\nThe Dishwasher is Larue's first book. When it was published in French three years ago, it became a breakaway critical and popular success in Quebec, winning many awards.\n\nLarue spoke to Enright about the stress of the service industry, his own gambling addiction and his novel's runaway success.\n\nClick 'listen' above to hear the interview.", "description": "St\u00e9phane Larue had the least glamourous job at a restaurant: a dishwasher. But it gave him an inside look at the hard-living characters working in frenetic, stress-filled kitchens. He turned those experiences into a novel, The Dishwasher, that takes the reader into the demi-monde of restaurant kitchens. It became a sensation and a big award-winner in Quebec and has just been translated into English.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5309975.1571426054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/the-dishwasher-larue.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
