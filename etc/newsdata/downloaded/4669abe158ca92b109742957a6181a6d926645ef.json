(Loic Venance/Afp Via Getty Images)\n\nThe top European Union court said Thursday that Facebook and other platforms can be required to remove illegal content worldwide, a ruling with global implications that pits the social media giant\u2019s free speech ethos against laws in other countries.\n\nThe E.U. Court of Justice ruled Facebook and other platforms will need to remove information or block access to any illegal material, including in some instances content that is \u201cequivalent.\u201d Judges can also order it taken down worldwide, \u201cwithin the framework of the relevant international law.\u201d\n\nThe decision upheld an Austrian ruling in which a politician sued Facebook to remove defamatory content and the court ordered it removed globally. Facebook had previously removed the content in Austria only.\n\n[Google scores major victory in E.U. \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 case]\n\nThe ruling has the potential to change the landscape for social media companies, which will be required to police content across their sites in direct contradiction to a preference toward free speech. It also upends previous tendencies toward country-by-country legal decisions on these types of issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s troubling because once other countries go down this route, it\u2019s going to be a free-for-all,\u201d said Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit think tank. \u201cA particular royal could say, \u2018No, you cannot insult the king or queen,\u2019 and Facebook could have to enforce that globally, possibly even for speakers outside of the country.\u201d\n\nFacebook spokeswoman Sarah Pollack said in a statement that the ruling could have a chilling effect on free speech and \u201craises critical questions around freedom of expression and the role Internet companies should play in monitoring, interpreting and removing speech that might be illegal in any particular company.\u201d\n\n[E.U. opens antitrust investigation into Amazon over third-party selling]\n\nIn the United States, a 1996 law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects Internet companies from liability for content created by their users. The protections allowed social media companies to grow, protecting them from legal liability from everything from users\u2019 product reviews to political rants. But it\u2019s recently come under attack from Democrats and Republicans.\n\nIn response to some of those concerns, Facebook last month unveiled a blueprint for a roughly 40-person panel to form an independent oversight board. The group will act as the company\u2019s version of a Supreme Court, dealing with appeals to the company\u2019s moderation decisions regarding the posts, photos and videos it takes down or leaves online.\n\nWhile Facebook is not allowed to appeal the ruling, Castro said individual European countries could choose to not to ask tech companies to remove content globally or countries like the United States could use trade agreements to pressure the E.U. for more expansive Internet freedom. The E.U. is reviewing its e-Commerce Directive and Digital Services Act, said Castro, so changes to those legal frameworks could also impact the effect of the ruling.\n\nThe decision comes about a week after the same court made a contrasting ruling in a case involving Google. In that case, the court determined the E.U.\u2019s right-to-be-forgotten doctrine, which gives residents more control over sensitive information that appears online, does not apply to search results worldwide.\n\n[Why Europe, not Congress, will rein in big tech]\n\nThough the U.S. Congress has in recent years increased its scrutiny of the tech industry\u2019s data and privacy practices, Europe has taken the lead in investigating and regulating the sector. European regulators fined Google about $1.7 billion in March on charges that its advertising practices violated antitrust laws. U.K. watchdogs last year were the first to fine Facebook for a lack of privacy protections in the wake of Cambridge Analytica. E.U. regulators are also looking into whether Amazon is misusing data from third-party sellers to develop and market the company\u2019s own products.\n\n(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nGoogle and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThursday\u2019s ruling stems from a 2016 case in which Austrian politician Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek sued Facebook Ireland for what she alleged to be defamatory comments alongside a news story shared on its platform.\n\nAccording to court documents, a user accused Glawischnig-Piesczek of being a \u201clousy traitor of the people,\u201d a \u201ccorrupt oaf\u201d and a member of a \u201cfascist party\u201d after the Austrian Green Party member posted a news story titled \u201cGreens: Minimum income for refugees should stay\u201d that also generated a thumbnail image of the politician.", "description": "Facebook says the ruling \u201craises critical questions around freedom of expression.\"", "authors": ["Marie C.
