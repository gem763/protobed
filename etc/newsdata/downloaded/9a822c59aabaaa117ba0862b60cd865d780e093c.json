REUTERS/Tom Brenner\n\nDemocratic-led states and environmental groups have announced they will challenge the move by the Republican president, his latest salvo against the most populous U.S. state, and legal experts expect complex and lengthy litigation that ultimately makes its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nShould a Democrat win the November 2020 election, it would be easier for the new president to unwind Trump\u2019s move if no definitive court ruling has been rendered on a policy with high stakes for the auto industry, consumers and the environment.\n\nThe Trump administration plans to announce in the coming months a weakening of federal vehicle emissions standards, one of numerous steps reversing environmental initiatives pursued by Democratic former President Barack Obama.\n\nCalifornia, a Democratic bastion, has for years had the authority to require automakers to build cleaner vehicles than federal requirements demand. Trump on Wednesday confirmed that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency plans to revoke California\u2019s authority. The formal announcement is due on Thursday.\n\nAdministration officials familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they are fighting the clock to get the courts to complete work on the matter before Trump\u2019s first term ends. They acknowledge that the fate of the rules may hinge on whether he wins a second term in office.\n\nThe legal fight is focused upon a provision of the Clean Air Act, a landmark federal law intended to combat air pollution, that allows California to receive a waiver from federal vehicle emissions standards, enabling the state to set its own.\n\nIn addition to the EPA revoking this waiver, Trump\u2019s Transportation Department is expected to declare that California\u2019s efforts to set its own vehicle emissions standards are preempted by another federal law, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, under which such emissions standards are established.\n\nCalifornia long has been a trend-setter on vehicle emissions standards, dating even to before the enactment of the Clean Air Act a half century ago. Other states have been permitted to adopt California\u2019s standards, which may be tougher than the federal ones.\n\n\u2018IT\u2019S HARD\u2019\n\nJonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland, said some of the administration\u2019s legal arguments could ultimately prevail but time is running short.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard from their standpoint,\u201d Adler said.\n\nUsually, cases involving the complexities of the Clean Air Act take months to resolve by the court that normally handles such issues: the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nIf the administration loses in that court, which has a majority of Democratic-appointed judges, it would likely appeal to the Supreme Court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority. It appears unlikely that the litigation could reach the nine justices in time for any resolution before the end of next year.\n\nThe truncated timeline for the legal challenge mirrors efforts by Obama\u2019s administration to implement its program to regulate carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants before the 2016 presidential election. The ambitious proposal was announced in 2015 but the Supreme Court put it on hold in February 2016 in a legal challenge filed by industry, meaning it was never implemented as litigation continued.\n\nThe appeals court formally dismissed that case this week, having made no determination on whether the Obama policy - ultimately reversed by Trump - was lawful.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s problem is ironically the same as the Obama administration in that they are trying to do big things and cement them in place but they are in danger of running out of time,\u201d said David Doniger, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that has said it will challenge Trump\u2019s California proposal.\n\nAutomakers have not yet taken a stance on the plan. The National Automobile Dealers Association, a trade group, backs the Trump administration.\n\nTrump met with major automakers in May 2018 and directed his aides to try to reach a deal with California \u2013 a decision that delayed the administration\u2019s decision to revoke the waiver by months if not longer.\n\n(This story adds dropped letter in first paragraph, year\u2019s instead of year.)", "description": "The expected legal battle over President Donald Trump's plan to revoke California's authority to set stiff vehicle emissions standards separate from those established by the U.S. government appears unlikely to be resolved before next year's presidential election.", "authors": ["Lawrence Hurley", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431391063&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H21F", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
