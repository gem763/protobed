Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York, said the dollar's moves after Trump's announcement were in line with the typical \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" reaction.\n\n\"We pretty much got what many people were expecting about a partial deal,\" said Moya. \"But it doesn't necessarily provide optimism that in the short run a broader deal will be reached because there are greater issues. It's still positive though.\"\n\nSterling rose to a more than three-month high versus the dollar on optimism about Brexit, while the euro advanced to a three-week peak as risk appetite rose.\n\nAt the same time, other safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc slid on the day.\n\nBefore the trade deal announcement, Trump and other U.S. officials on Friday had signaled good news was coming in trade talks with China, while Beijing indicated it was open to a \"partial\" deal that would avoid a planned hike in tariffs on its goods.\n\nOn Brexit, the EU agreed on Friday to hold another round of intense negotiations with London in a bid to secure a deal. negotiator Michel Barnier and his British counterpart Stephen Barclay earlier held what both sides called a \"constructive\" meeting in Brussels as Britain's scheduled departure date of Oct. 31 nears. The British and Irish prime ministers said on Thursday they had found \"a pathway\" to a possible deal, and by Friday some officials were expressing guarded optimism.\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve announced Friday it will start buying about $60 billion per month in Treasury bills to ensure \"ample reserves\" in the banking system. It emphasized though that the new program does not mark a change in monetary policy. allays some of the funding concerns and removes some of the upside risks of the squeeze on funding that we saw at month- and quarter-end,\" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.\n\nIn late afternoon trading, the was down 0.4% at 98.318 , after earlier declining to a 3-1/2-month low of 98.197.\n\nThe euro, meanwhile, rose 0.3% to $1.1034 , mirroring the three-week high reached on Thursday.\n\nThe safe-haven yen weakened against the dollar, which gained 0.3% to 108.33. The dollar earlier touched a 2-1/2-month high against the yen.\n\nSterling surged to a more than three-month high of $1.2708 GBP=D3 and a five-month peak of 87.02 pence against the euro EURGBP=D3 . The pound was last up 1.7% at $1.2657.\n\n========================================================\n\nCurrency bid prices at 4:23PM (2023 GMT) Description\n\nU.S. Close Pct Change\n\nYTD Pct\n\nHigh Bid\n\nLow Bid\n\nPrevious\n\nChange\n\nSession\n\nEuro/Dollar\n\n$1.1037\n\n$1.1004\n\n+0.30%\n\n-3.78%\n\n+1.1062\n\n+1.1002 Dollar/Yen\n\n108.3500\n\n107.9600\n\n+0.36%\n\n-1.73%\n\n+108.6100 +107.8600 Euro/Yen\n\nEURJPY=\n\n119.59\n\n118.80\n\n+0.66%\n\n-5.25%\n\n+119.9900 +118.7400 Dollar/Swiss\n\n0.9971\n\n0.9969\n\n+0.02%\n\n+1.60%\n\n+0.9990\n\n+0.9959 Sterling/Dollar GBP=\n\n1.2650\n\n1.2440\n\n+1.69%\n\n-0.84%\n\n+1.2705\n\n+1.2409 Dollar/Canadian CAD=\n\n1.3204\n\n1.3290\n\n-0.65%\n\n-3.18%\n\n+1.3300\n\n+1.3170 Australian/Doll AUD=\n\n0.6790\n\n0.6761\n\n+0.43%\n\n-3.67%\n\n+0.6810\n\n+0.6754 ar\n\nEuro/Swiss\n\nEURCHF=\n\n1.1006\n\n1.0970\n\n+0.33%\n\n-2.20%\n\n+1.1039\n\n+1.0966 Euro/Sterling\n\nEURGBP=\n\n0.8721\n\n0.8845\n\n-1.40%\n\n-2.93%\n\n+0.8868\n\n+0.8696 NZ\n\n0.6332\n\n0.6318\n\n+0.22%\n\n-5.73%\n\n+0.6353\n\n+0.6317 Dollar/Dollar\n\nDollar/Norway\n\n9.0770\n\n9.1238\n\n-0.51%\n\n+5.07%\n\n+9.1290\n\n+9.0509 Euro/Norway\n\nEURNOK=\n\n10.0201\n\n10.0430\n\n-0.23%\n\n+1.12%\n\n+10.0510\n\n+10.0015 Dollar/Sweden\n\n9.8034\n\n9.8403\n\n-0.07%\n\n+9.37%\n\n+9.8465\n\n+9.7863 Euro/Sweden\n\nEURSEK=\n\n10.8221\n\n10.8301\n\n-0.07%\n\n+5.44%\n\n+10.8546\n\n+10.8090", "description": "FOREX-Dollar skids to 3-month low on Brexit, trade optimism", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE7F0FX_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
