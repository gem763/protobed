Last June, outrage over the policy of dividing migrant families in the custody of Department of Homeland Security led to an executive order ending the policy, though not exactly fixing the problem: New rules proposed by the Trump administration effectively allow migrant children to be detained indefinitely with their parents, violating the Flores agreement, which limits child detention to 20 days.\n\nMore than 2,700 families were known to have been separated when the policy was active. But on Thursday \u2014 hours before the expiration of a six-month deadline laid down by the U.S. Court for the Southern District of California requiring the administration to identify all children separated \u2014 the White House informed the American Civil Liberties Union that an additional 1,556 migrant families were separated between July 2017 and June 2018, bringing the new total to at least 4,300 separated families. Most of the children removed from their parents\u2019 custody were under 12, and over 200 were younger than 5 years old.\n\nThis month, former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has been engaging in an image-rehab effort. Speaking at Fortune magazine\u2019s \u201cMost Powerful Women\u201d summit, she claimed that she \u201cspoke truth to power from the very beginning,\u201d while adding that she did not regret enforcing child separation because \u201cI took an oath to do that.\u201d Last month, a government-watchdog report stated that separated migrant children have suffered from \u201cfeelings of fear or guilt\u201d and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nResponding to the new 1,556 separation number, the ACLU stated that it was unclear if these families had been reunited. ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt told the Washington Post that he fears the parents of these separated children have already been deported. \u201cThese are the families we\u2019re going to have to search for all over the world,\u201d Gelernt said. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the middle of trying to find them.\u201d", "description": "On Thursday, the Trump administration informed the American Civil Liberties Union that an additional 1,556 migrant families were separated between July 2017 and June 2018, bringing the total of separated migrant children to at least 4,300.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/21/family_seperation.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
