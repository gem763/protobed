A score of one would belong to someone like Alice Walton, the Walmart heiress worth $51.4 billion, who \"inherited her fortune but is not working to increase it.\" A score of 10 would belong to Oprah Winfrey, someone \"self-made who not only grew up poor but also overcame significant obstacles.\"\n\nRead more: Income inequality in the US has hit a record high. Meet the 15 richest American family 'dynasties,' who have a combined net worth of $618 billion.\n\nEven with the sliding scoring system, the broad definition only applied to 11 women on this year's Forbes 400 list. Jenner, with her estimated net worth of $1 billion, did not qualify for the list's $2.1 billion minimum. She has a self-made score of 7, meaning she \"got a head start from wealthy parents and a moneyed background.\"\n\nMost of the women on this list scored at an 8 (\"self-made who came from a middle- or upper-middle-class background\") or a 9 (\"self-made who came from a largely working-class background; rose from little or nothing\").\n\nThe members of the Forbes 400 are worth $2.96 trillion. The self-made women club, one of the smallest subsects of the overall list, is worth a collective $37.2 billion.\n\nHere are the 11 richest self-made women in the US. They are ranked in ascending order of wealth and their net worths are estimates as of October 2, 2019.", "description": "From Oprah Winfrey to Meg Whitman, only 11 women on the Forbes 400 list in 2019 qualify as \"self-made.\" Here's a look at who made the list.", "authors": ["Taylor Borden"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9dfc68122bd530df659c54?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
