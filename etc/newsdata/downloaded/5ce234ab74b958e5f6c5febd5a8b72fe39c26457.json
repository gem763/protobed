Tennis' modern-day bad boy took on bitter rival Rafael Nadal in a heated second-round clash at Wimbledon Thursday and it was another classic in the Kyrgios canon.\n\nThere were stare downs, underarm serves, code violations and a deliberate forehand blast straight at Nadal's chest.\n\nThe match, won by an ecstatic Nadal, was gripping and gladiatorial in equal measure. Not just for the level of play, but for the history between the two and the antics of the Australian.\n\nLove him or hate him, Kyrgios is the stuff of water-cooler conversations.\n\nSo the simple question is -- is Nick Kyrgios good for tennis? Is he a larrikin (Aussie slang for boisterous troublemaker) or liability?\n\nFirstly, let's not deny it. When Kyrgios plays, we all watch.\n\n\"He moves the needle,\" said Roger Rasheed, who has been around professional tennis for decades as a TV analyst, coach and past member of the ATP board.\n\nNick Kyrgios (left) and Rafael Nadal shake hands after their heated clash at Wimbledon.\n\n'Box-office'\n\nIn this age of Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat, Kyrgios is right up the street of the younger population \u2014 which tennis is trying to attract, by the way.\n\nThey don't necessarily want to dwell on forehands and backhands for hours, just like Kyrgios doesn't have any interest in hitting those forehands and backhands for hours.\n\nThe \"box office\" tag often associated with Kyrgios is wholly appropriate. Even when he is not trying to amuse, he still does \u2014 like when he sneezed three times in a row in an incident that had everyone in hysterics Thursday.\n\nSitting on Centre Court, the yells of \"Come on, Nick\" or \"Come on, Kyrgios\" couldn't be overlooked, and they seemed to come largely from that younger audience.\n\nIf he didn't edge the match in terms of support, Kyrgios certainly wasn't far off against one of tennis' greatest ever players renowned and respected for his commitment and intensity.\n\nKyrgios went too far when he called chair umpire Damien Dumusois a \"disgrace\" for not cracking down on the time Nadal took between points, but he was correct in his assessment that the Frenchman was too lenient.\n\nNadal appeared to play on Kyrgios' lingering beef about his slow play, be it waiting a fraction longer to leave his chair when the chair umpire called \"time\" or making the 24-year-old wait while he received serve.\n\nTennis authorities are trying to speed up the game, remember, which is why a shot clock is now regularly used at events around the world.\n\nNick Kyrgios fires a forehand against Rafael Nadal on Centre Court.\n\nUnderarm or underhand?\n\nMuch was made about Kyrgios being spotted at a local watering hole Wednesday evening.\n\nHe admitted as much in his post-match press conference, and according to reports, Kyrgios was in a perfectly presentable condition when he left the pub.\n\nBut was this any way to prepare for a big match?\n\nPut other athletes in his position and they'd be affectionately termed \"one of the gang.\"\n\nAnd hey, even though he partied all week and went jet skiing before the final in Acapulco in March, Kyrgios still won the tournament. So what's the problem?\n\nWhen Centre Court met the underarm ace...\n\n\n\nWe all knew this was coming, didn't we?#Wimbledon | @NickKyrgios pic.twitter.com/0gzovjH4bp \u2014 Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 4, 2019\n\nWhen it comes to his actual tennis game, Kyrgios' shot-making can be astoundingly good.\n\nHe has beaten Nadal three times, which tells you he's not all flash and no substance.\n\nThe serve is one of the biggest ever in tennis and his backhand gives Nadal the same type of issues that Novak Djokovic's does. Djokovic has been Nadal's toughest ever opponent.\n\nAs for those underarm serves, many players \u2014 including Roger Federer \u2014 say there's nothing wrong with it.\n\nIt offers the element of surprise, like the drop shot.\n\nIndeed, think of an underarm serve as a drop shot to start the point.\n\nWith Nadal often standing miles behind the baseline to help his return game, it's a viable option.\n\nKyrgios won both points when he used the underarm serve on Thursday, with the first classified an ace because Nadal didn't touch the ball. Even Nadal smiled.\n\nGood tactics, then.\n\nIn a few years the Big Three of Nadal, Federer and Djokovic will all be retired.\n\nThe networks, especially, will be looking for someone to pick up the (ratings) slack and Kyrgios is one of the main candidates.\n\nKyrgios combines power with a deft touch.\n\nThen again...\n\nOn the other hand, though entertaining, Kyrgios often goes too far. His list of indiscretions is lengthy and still open ended.\n\nHey, even the best of them have uttered bad language on court. Federer, in the 2009 US Open final against Juan Martin del Potro, for starters.\n\nBut that was a rare blemish from the Swiss master aimed at the chair umpire, while Kyrgios is a serial offender who has targeted umpires and fans with greater vitriol\n\nWith microphones picking up anything and everything nowadays, that clearly isn't the example to present to kids who often view athletes as role models and place them on the highest of pedestals.\n\nAt a time when prize money is a hot topic on the men's player council, would sponsors \u2014 who drive prize money \u2014 want to get involved with Kyrgios doing all that?\n\nIt's not the image they'd want to project.\n\nNick Kyrgios had words with umpire Damien Dumusois in his match against Rafael Nadal.\n\nNadal had it 100% correct when he said in February the Australian doesn't respect opponents, the crowd or himself. Examples constantly bear that out.\n\nHis own time-wasting tactics Tuesday against compatriot Jordan Thompson \u2014 throwing himself to the ground at least twice after points ended \u2014 received little attention probably only because his sometime Davis Cup teammate didn't make a fuss.\n\nPutting in a 19-minute set as he did against Thompson in set four is something, sadly, we've come to expect from Kyrgios.\n\nIf he was on a basketball court \u2014 basketball is the sport he loves, not tennis \u2014 he'd never go through the motions.\n\nStill, tennis is his job and he owes it to stakeholders to deliver a good shift.\n\nGoodness knows, he's earning enough to do so.\n\nKrygios pulled out the 'tweener' trick shot against Nadal.\n\nAccording to Britain's four-time Wimbledon semi finalist Tim Henman, Kyrgios has the skill, if not the temperament currently, to reach the very top.\n\n\"Rafa is just phenomenal,\" Henman explained to CNN. \"His intensity, the quality, the level he plays day in day out.\n\n\"And that's what I think a lot of people hope that Nick can apply himself to do because you can see the enormous tennis talent he has but physically and mentally, day in day out, he's too inconsistent.\"\n\nTrying \u2014 and erring \u2014 on shot a between the legs on a big point against Thompson when the simpler option was to hit a routine forehand rubs it in the face of the opponent, like a footballer attempting a nutmeg with his side leading by three or four goals.\n\nIt's not necessarily a good look.\n\nNick Krygios relaxes ahead of practice at Wimbledon.\n\nAnd what of Kyrgios' time at the pub Wednesday?\n\nTennis has moved on from the 1970s and 80s, when such a soiree wouldn't have been as newsworthy.\n\nThings are much more professional nowadays.\n\nHaving alcohol \u2014 if he did have some, and we don't know \u2014 isn't something you would see Nadal, Federer or others consume the evening before a match.\n\nNot the hydration they'd be looking for.\n\nAt least Kyrgios was honest enough to admit post-match that he was currently too unprofessional to contend for a grand slam.\n\nJUST WATCHED Wimbledon: The original grand slam Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Wimbledon: The original grand slam 01:40\n\nThose Kyrgios press conferences can be prickly, flippant, but often amusing affairs, too -- cringe-making for the traditionalists, box-office for others. When it was put to him Nadal didn't look too pleased with his shot into the Spaniard's chest, he simply replied: \"And?\"\n\nIt seems like in every Kyrgios match, he crunches at least a couple of forehands and doesn't care where they land.\n\nOne of these days, one of his misdirected rockets could hit an umpire, lines person or fan. One forehand almost hit a lines person Thursday, in fact.\n\nThen the tale of Kyrgios would ascend to another, sad tier.\n\nFive years after he announced himself to the tennis world by beating Nadal at Wimbledon, there's still no real sign that Kyrgios is intent on being the professional that would see him turn the table and win multiple grand slams.\n\nBut is he good for tennis?
