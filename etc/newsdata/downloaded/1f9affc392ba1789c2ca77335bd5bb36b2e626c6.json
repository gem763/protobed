I think he was looking forward to participating in an exciting sector that was about to take off, and rather, not soon after taking the CFO job, found the exact opposite.\n\nThe company would never confirm that one way or another, and in reality, it no longer matters. Why Monahan left has little impact on the performance of the company going forward. That said, losing the high-profile CFO does weaken the stature of Hexo at a time when it would have helped.\n\nWhat matters going forward is how long it'll take Hexo to recover, and how it'll deal with cash burn as revenues continue to plummet.\n\nHEXO price target More\n\nThe macro cannabis picture\n\nFor cannabis companies based in Canada, investors need to include the slow rollout of retail outlets in their models. More than any other factor, this has weighed on the performance of companies, and will continue to do so for at least two or three quarters.\n\nThe reasons for this is not only the lack of stores to sell out of, but also the propensity for many consumers to go to the black market for their cannabis needs.\n\nAlthough there are those that have suggested supply is the culprit because it's oupacing demand, that isn't an accurate assessment of the situation. There is plenty of pent-up demand in the Canadian cannabis market. Again, the issue is the lack of physical stores to sell products in.\n\nFrom the point of view of supply temporarily exceeding demand because of few places to sell from, that would be true. But for the overall market, there is still plenty of demand that current supply could meet if there was a place to sell it out of.\n\nEventually supply will exceed demand, but that time hasn't arrived yet. For now, investors need to discount revenue until confirmation that many more physical stores have opened in Canada. This is especially true for Quebec and Ontario.\n\nChanged outlook\n\nThe company guided for revenue in the quarter ended July 31 to be in a range of C$14.5 million to C$16.5 million. That is about a third less than the C$24.8 million consensus from FactSet.\n\nIn the short term the reason given for a decline in expected revenue was \u201clower than expected product sell through.\u201d Other companies have pointed to similar reasoning, but it puzzles me because it has been clear for some time that Health Canada was far behind in the approval process for licensing of physical stores. Why this wasn't pointed out much earlier doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\n\nWhat is surprising the market, in my opinion, is the fact the companies continued to operate under assumptions made early in 2019, where expectations were there would be a lot more retail stores to sell out of. But it has been apparent that wasn't going to happen in the near future.\n\nThat means either Hexo believed it was going to be able to generate higher sales with or without the increase in outlets, or it failed to adjust its numbers to align with the market realities. The cost for that failure is the share price of the company getting hammered.\n\nStory continues", "description": "My suspicion surrounding the stated reason for former CFO Mike Monahan leaving Hexo (HEXO) has been confirmed, as almost immediately afterward the company announced a revenue warning, as well as withdrawing its financial outlook for fiscal 2020.It's certain that Monahan changed his mind after going", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RsL1qVYLvHxRjbw8Fmh3RQ--~B/aD01Mjc7dz0xNTA1O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/tipranks_452/59a820626fe7dd066edaece82de4ce97", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
