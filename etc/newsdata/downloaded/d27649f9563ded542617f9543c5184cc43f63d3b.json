They are advertised as energy boosters but are mainly high in caffeine, which acts on the central nervous system in order to achieve its effects.\n\nConsuming five to six of these energy drinks a day goes well beyond the daily dosage of caffeine (400 mg) recommended by the Korea Food and Drug Administration. According to the KFDA, any drink that contains more than 0.15 mg of caffeine per 1 ml is considered a high-caffeine drink.\n\nOne female middle schooler in the affluent Gangnam area of southern Seoul said, \"I think I'm hooked on energy drinks. If I don't drink them, my mind becomes numb and I can't do anything.\" She said she drinks more than five cans a day to stay awake until the early hours of the morning. She goes to private crammers right after school and does not come home until 1 a.m. and goes to bed after 2 a.m.\n\nAnd a high school student in Seoul said, \"My friend told me the energy drinks could keep me awake, so now I drink them during test season.\"", "description": "Youngsters Get Hooked on Caffeine Drinks", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2012/02/07/2012020701011_0.jpg", "published_at": "2012-02-07"}
