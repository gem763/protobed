We\u2019ve had Gigi on the show before to talk about the ramifications following the repeal of net neutrality.\n\nThis time, we brought her back to talk about some recent developments in the tech policy world, including lawmakers in states like California introducing net neutrality bills.\n\nWe also talk to Gigi about the Sprint and T-Mobile merger and the issues surrounding how that merger will seemingly go through unless it\u2019s stopped by a lawsuit from several states. Can Dish become a fourth mobile carrier?\n\nBelow is a lightly edited excerpt of that part of the conversation.\n\nNilay Patel: And that\u2019s a good time to shift our attention to Sprint and T-Mobile.\n\nI mean, in my mind, this is all one big issue. They\u2019re actually separate issues. But in my mind, the lack of competition is what drove the net neutrality moment. There\u2019s not enough competition for the market to provide options and choice and fairness. So here we have net neutrality is gone, save the states and potentially some appeals.\n\nAnd on the other hand, you have the market consolidating, which seems like the whole reason that you\u2019d want the regulatory scheme. This is, in my mind, a very complicated scheme to somehow preserve four wireless carriers. Describe the plan.\n\nGigi Sohn: So this plan came from the Department of Justice. Let me just ratchet back because the whole process to getting where we got has been so weird and so opaque that I think people need to understand what kind of gymnastics this administration has been doing in order to grant a four-to-three merger. And this is all in the same context. We\u2019re talking about breaking up Google and Facebook, right? You know, antitrust is being revived, which I think is fantastic. It\u2019s about time.\n\nBut we\u2019re talking about Republicans and Democrats talking about the need to break up companies that are too powerful.\n\nAnd while this is happening, we\u2019re going from a four mobile carrier market to three, despite overwhelming evidence that it would diminish competition and raise prices.\n\nSo I think it\u2019s important to talk about the machinations here. In late May of this year, Chairman Pai announced via a statement that he was going to circulate soon an order to his colleagues approving the Sprint T-Mobile merger \u2014 this was before there was any conversation about a fourth carrier \u2014 and that it would be good for 5G deployment. Which is, of course, the universal excuse for all deregulation, and it would be good for rural deployment, getting capacity, getting deployment to rural areas, which is a nonsensical argument. But I won\u2019t address that now. Shortly thereafter, like within hours, Commissioner Carr said, \u201cMe, too\u201d without seeing an order. There\u2019s no order because he\u2019s going to circulate it in a couple of weeks.\n\nAnd I think the next day or two days, Commissioner O\u2019Rielly, the other Republican, says, \u201cMe, too.\u201d So already, they\u2019ve all prejudged an order they\u2019ve never seen. I never saw anything like that in my life. Two months later, the Department of Justice says, \u201cYou know what? Four to three is anti-competitive, at least in this case. It\u2019s anti-competitive and illegal. So therefore, we are going to create (what I call a mobile Frankenstein), which is Dish Network. We\u2019re going to basically create the conditions under which, in seven years, Dish Network will be able to provide service.\u201d\n\nNow, you don\u2019t need to be genius to figure out that a lot can go wrong in seven years, particularly because this mobile Frankenstein can only operate at the behest of T-Mobile. So for the first seven years, Dish Network \u2014 which would get 9 million prepaid customers \u2014they would get Boost Mobile, which is one of the pay ahead of time prepaid services that poor people use or people that don\u2019t have good credit ratings use. So they get 9 million customers compared to Verizon\u2019s 130 Sprint/T-Mobile\u2019s 100 million and they could start to build a business using T Mobile\u2019s network.\n\nNow, tell me what incentive T-Mobile has to make that easy for Dish to do?\n\nAgain, this is a conservative Republican assistant attorney general who has said a million times that behavioral conditions don\u2019t work, you know, essentially creating out of whole cloth \u201ca new fourth competitor.\u201d So that was the end of July.\n\nCan you explain what you mean by \u201cbehavioral conditions\u201d?\n\nOkay. So behavioral conditions are, for example, \u201cT-Mobile must let Dish use its network to provide service.\u201d A structural condition is \u201cOkay, Sprint must spin off Boost, must sell Boost to Dish.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s where, basically, you take a part of your business and you sell it to someone else or you give it to someone else. That\u2019s where you\u2019re actually reworking the structure of a company.\n\nA behavioral condition is one where you\u2019re saying, \u201cOkay, company, you must be nice by doing X.\u201d\n\nSo the FCC decision yesterday is going to say something along these lines: \u201cThe new Sprint / T-Mobile promises to serve X number of rural people in five years and plans to deploy 5G in 97 percent of communities in five years or seven years.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a behavioral condition where you\u2019re depending on the company that\u2019s merging to behave.\n\nNow, why do Republicans \u2014 and, frankly, I\u2019m not a Republican, but I don\u2019t like them, either \u2014 why are they not really favored by antitrust authorities? Because the government has to make them do it. And usually, those companies have a hell of a lot more resources to lawyer the living daylights out of those conditions than the government does. And they often never come to fruition.\n\nSo you\u2019ve got Makan Delrahim the assistant attorney general for antitrust who gave speech after speech of the last several years saying how behavioral conditions don\u2019t work, creating this new entity mostly out of behavioral conditions. The spinoff of Boost and the only 9 million, it\u2019s like one-tenth of what everybody else has. And they\u2019re prepaid customers, which, by the way, is like having zero customers because a prepaid customer can walk away anytime. So the implementation risks for Dish to get up and running and compete in any way, shape, or form in seven years are enormous.\n\nIs there any spectrum transfer to Dish?\n\nYes, but not really spectrum that they need. In fact, they\u2019re transferring a bunch of the old Nextel. So Sprint bought Nextel years back...\n\nAnother wild success story of consolidation.\n\nA horrible lack of success, and, yes, Dish has the option to buy it. They don\u2019t even have to buy it. So that will tell you how valuable it is if they don\u2019t even have to buy. We\u2019ve always known Dish has plenty of spectrum. That\u2019s not the issue. What they don\u2019t have is a network. So the idea here is, you know, let them use T-Mobile\u2019s network for seven years and then let them cobble together their own. Let them get the backhaul. Let them get the antennas. Let them build their own network in the next seven years.\n\nNow, my question is, if Sprint so desperately wants to get out of the market, why don\u2019t they just sell their network to Dish? Why are we doing this thing where we allow these two entities to merge and then pray and hope that Dish can build a network?\n\nSo here\u2019s the argument I\u2019ve heard on that, and I hear it from our readers quite a bit: \u201cWe like T-Mobile. T-Mobile is great. They came into the market. John Legere is a firebrand. He took on the big carriers. He makes a product, a service that we like. The big competitors have had to react to him, and they have in certain ways. Why wouldn\u2019t we want to strengthen T-Mobile by letting them run Sprint and getting Sprint spectrum and making them as big as AT&T? Why wouldn\u2019t we want this company that we like to be an even better competitor to big companies that we don\u2019t?\u201d\n\nWell, I like T-Mobile, too, and I\u2019m a very satisfied T-Mobile customer. However, you know, when you go from four to three, the incentives change. Yes, it is definitely true. And by the way, I testified against the AT&T / T-Mobile merger, which led to T-Mobile becoming what it is today. So I feel like I\u2019m partly responsible.\n\nBut when you have four, you had a situation where T-Mobile was not only competing with AT&T and Verizon and changing their behavior, but it was also competing with Sprint and Sprint with it for the low value customer. Once you shrink that to three evenly sized companies, the incentive to go after the low value customer goes away because you\u2019ve gotten rid of Sprint, who is keeping your prices down. And we\u2019ve seen this in many markets in Europe. The incentive becomes to act more like AT&T and Verizon and raise prices and not have as family-friendly plans. And in fact, the record at the FCC shows that this is exactly what would happen. The prices would go up. Now the companies say, \u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re right. Prices will go up, but you\u2019ll get more for your money.\u201d\n\nBut where does that leave the value-conscious customers? Maybe they don\u2019t want to pay 15 dollars more a month or whatever. I think it said between 15 and 21 percent more a month. Maybe they don\u2019t want that super speedy service. So what happens to them?\n\nAgain, the problem is, as we\u2019ve seen over and over again in four-to-three markets, prices go up, and people are left out in the cold.\n\nWell, presumably they get to Dish. Isn\u2019t it true that the argument here is it\u2019s not four to three; it\u2019s four to three for a minute and then four to four in seven years? I\u2019m not saying that I believe it or I can make it without laughing, but that is the argument. We\u2019ve cobbled together an interim solution where even like running the infrastructure of the network and like the administrative part of the network for Dish until Dish is up and running in seven years.\n\nI think the better solution, the cleaner solution, is to have Sprint sell its assets. And it\u2019s not only Dish that\u2019s interested. The news reports were also saying that Charter was trying to become that fourth competitor as well. So they\u2019re interested. There may be other cable companies interested in buying Sprint\u2019s assets. I just think, you know, if Sprint sells its assets to a company like Dish or a company like Charter or somebody else, then a network will definitely be run, and it will be run right away. But, you know, you\u2019re asking this company that has never run a mobile network \u2014 it runs a satellite video network, which is very different \u2014 to start with one-tenth of the customers, none of them postpaid and become a competitor in seven years and build a network.\n\nI mean, you know, you\u2019re assuming that they can get the backhaul, and if they can get the antennas and then they can actually build this thing. I just think that kind of risk, particularly when there\u2019s another option that\u2019s better, should not fall on consumers.\n\nAnd by the way, T-Mobile is kicking butt. T-Mobile is taking customers away mostly from Sprint but also from AT&T and Verizon. So they\u2019re actually growing the way you should: by competing.", "description": "Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks to Gigi Sohn, a distinguished fellow at Georgetown Law\u2019s Institute for Technology Law and Policy all about the status of net neutrality and how the Sprint/T-Mobile merger is going down.", "authors": ["Andrew Marino", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SSrEMRaiydxtOS4Qv6jfmApWsFY=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10752763/acasatro_180430_1777_sprint_Tmobile_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
