This is a wonderful, creative way for us to honor his legacy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCOURREGES: ON THE WATERFRONT\n\nThe Saint Martin canal in central Paris was the hip urban setting for Courreges\u2019 spring display, which treated guests to a musical spectacle on the waterfront.\n\nGuests flanked the canal banks as a barge glided past amid a smoke and light display with a singer warbling from the deck.\n\nAs the boat docked, the models disembarked onto the street runway to reveal an urban collection with a sporty, retro aesthetic with lashings of color-blocking.\n\nMore pared down and more focused than last season, spring saw designer Yolanda Zobel reinterpret the miniskirt, a style the house laid claim to inventing in the 60s.\n\nThe garment came in urban light acid green below a color-blocked stiff bright orange jacket, and elsewhere in a more retro style in red gingham tablecloth with a flappy tied bow. Continuing the retro-infused designs, the show saw a return to bell bottoms and a flared aesthetic.\n\nThe designs of Andre Courreges once set the trends for stars like Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve who admired its ground-breaking geometry, plastic miniskirts, space-age silhouettes and futuristic textiles.\n\n___\n\nARORA\u2019S LGBTQ SHOW\n\nManish Arora was applauded Thursday for bringing the conversation about the global LGBTQ community to the heart of Paris Fashion Week in a collection entitled: \u201cLove is Love.\u201d\n\nThe exuberant New Delhi-based designer worked his signature color-rich psychedelia on drag queens and performers in a show of diverse gender-bending styles that were displayed on the theater stage.\n\nA male singer in pink perforated silk column dress and a feather eye mask serenaded guests.\n\nThen, a female model in a bejeweled yellow armor-like vest bent over backward acrobatically. She wore a heart-shaped handbag in yellow alongside eye-popping multicolor platform shoes.\n\nEvoking Arora\u2019s native India, an A-line skirt cut on the bias had an exotic feel with banding and myriad decorative detailing.\n\nWhile this collection didn\u2019t have the high-fashion feel of a typical ready-to-wear show, it was a highly entertaining spectacle.\n\n___\n\nThomas Adamson can be followed at Twitter.com/ThomasAdamson_K\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Model and singer Pixie Geldof and Louis Vuitton designer Nicolas Ghesquiere watched from Grand Palais' front row Thursday morning in Paris as Chloe put on a spring manifesto in wearable chic.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Thomas Adamson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/paris_fashion_s_s_2020_courreges_68175_c0-124-2972-1856_s1770x1032.jpg?ac131b282214010de1ed33cdad0c6fce65cbf30f", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
