REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s vast financial services industry will lose more jobs to Europe over the coming years because of Brexit, the City of London\u2019s policy chief told Reuters, warning people not to be duped by the low number of job moves to the continent so far.\n\nThe City of London, home to global foreign exchange, bonds and fund management operations and to more banks than any other financial center, faces upheaval as firms decide whether to shift jobs to continental Europe to keep serving customers there after Britain is scheduled to leave the EU in two weeks.\n\nCatherine McGuinness, the political leader of the financial district\u2019s municipal body, warned that the country\u2019s biggest export sector and biggest source of corporate tax has no \u201cGod given right\u201d to global pre-eminence in finance.\n\n\u201cThe announced job moves at the moment are fairly low. We would expect those to go up,\u201d McGuinness said in an interview in a room off the local government\u2019s seat of power in the medieval Guildhall. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the story. This is a moment of high risk for the City.\u201d\n\nSince Britain voted to leave the European Union three years ago, London\u2019s financial services industry has been jolted by the prospect of ending four decades of regulatory integration and losing access to the bloc in one fell swoop later this year.", "description": "Britain's vast financial services industry will lose more jobs to Europe over the coming years because of Brexit, the City of London's policy chief told Reuters, warning people not to be duped by the low number of job moves to the continent so far.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441019985&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0F0", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
