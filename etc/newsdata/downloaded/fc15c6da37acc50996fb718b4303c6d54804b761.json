And I asked her, \"Does this go away if I just white knuckle through it?\" she said, \"No, it actually gets worse.\"\n\n'So as soon as I heard that, \u2026 so then I went on medication right away.'\n\nShe also meditates, leans on loved ones, and writes music.\n\n'When I'm in any state, emotionally sad, angry, freaked out, lonely, isolated, depressed, I can write. Thank God for that,' she said.\n\nThough there are moments when she gets 'a little cocky' thinking it's getting easier, 'I don't think of it in terms of cured because I know that postpartum isn't something that lasts a week. You know, for me, it's at least two years, maybe a little longer,' she said.\n\nCoping strategies: She meditates, leans on loved ones, and writes music to get through, and also went on medication\n\nLoving life: Still, despite her struggles, the possibility of falling into postpartum depression never stopped her from growing her family\n\nAhead of @CBSThisMorning's live #StopTheStigma special Wednesday focusing on mental health, singer @Alanis Morissette talks about her postpartum depression, and her mission to help other mothers.\n\n\n\nWatch on @CBS 7-9 a.m.\n\npic.twitter.com/9DfAGvNdOU \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) October 22, 2019\n\nStill, despite her struggles, the possibility of falling into postpartum depression never stopped her from growing her family.\n\n'Because I'd experienced the other side of postpartum depression and having this relationship \u2026 I know there's a light at the end of the tunnel,' she said.\n\n'I'd be willing to go through it again. I know that sounds a little insane but, you know, I'm willing to \u2014 present sacrifice for future gain. I've done it a million times.'\n\nShe also hopes that sharing her own story will help break down the stigmas around mental illness.\n\n'There is something about chronicling the experience in real time. If the goal is a stigma-free perception of any mental illness or mental health conversation, understanding and giving the details of really looks like from the inside is important,' she said.\n\nAlanis had been quite candid in her essay on her website on October 6, explaining how she maintains a sense of hope.\n\n'Because I'd experienced the other side of postpartum depression and having this relationship \u2026 I know there's a light at the end of the tunnel,' she said\n\nOnline: Alanis had been quite candid in her essay on her website on October 6, explaining how she maintains a sense of hope\n\n'I have been here before. I know there is another side. And the other side is greater than my PPD-riddled-temporarily-adjusted-brain could have ever imagined: as a mom. as an artist. as a wife. as a friend. as a collaborator. as a leader. as a boss. as an activist,' she wrote.\n\n'I saw how things got richer after I came through it the last two times.
