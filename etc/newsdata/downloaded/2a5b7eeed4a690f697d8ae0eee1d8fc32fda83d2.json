The whistleblower started this whole thing by writing a report on the conversation I had with the president of Ukraine. And the conversation was perfect; it couldn\u2019t have been nicer.\u201d\n\n\u2014 President Trump, remarks to reporters, Oct. 2, 2019\n\n\u201cThe whistleblower said terrible things about the call, but he then \u2014 I then found out he was secondhand and third-hand. In other words, he didn\u2019t know what was on the call.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trump, remarks to reporters, Oct. 2\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s claim that the whistleblower was \u201cvery inaccurate,\u201d much of the details of the whistleblower complaint have already been confirmed by additional information, documents and reporting. Here\u2019s a quick guide to what the whistleblower alleged \u2014 and what has been confirmed. (Note: While Trump dismissed the information as \u201csecondhand and third-hand,\u201d the whistleblower signed a form saying he was a firsthand witness to at least some of the events recounted.)\n\nWe will examine the whistleblower\u2019s allegations in the order in which he made them, under the sections as he labeled them.\n\nI. The 25 July Presidential phone call\n\nWhat\u2019s confirmed\n\nTrump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to \u201cinitiate or continue an investigation\u201d into Joe Biden.\n\nCorrect. The rough transcript released by the White House shows Trump telling Zelensky: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General [William P. Barr] would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d (Note: The ellipsis appears in the White House document, suggesting something may have been removed before release.) As we have documented, Trump\u2019s claim that Biden stopped the prosecution of his son Hunter is false.\n\nTrump raised the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory.\n\nCorrect. The complaint says that Trump asked Zelensky for assistance in examining the debunked theory that the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was started in Ukraine.\n\nThe whistleblower also said Trump made \u201ca specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cyber security firm Crowdstrike.\u201d Trump\u2019s language is not especially precise, but he certainly suggests Ukraine has the DNC servers and asks Zelensky \u201cto get to the bottom of it.\u201d (The rough White House transcript also has ellipses in this section, indicating sections could have been removed before release.)\n\n\u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people \u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you\u2019re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nTrump told Zelensky to \u201cmeet or speak\u201d with his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and Barr.\n\nYes, this happened repeatedly in the call: \u201cI will ask him [Giuliani] to call you along with the Attorney General,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it,\u201d he said at another point. Also: \u201cI will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.\u201d Trump also suggested that a presidential-level meeting \u2014 long sought by Zelensky \u2014 would happen only after Zelensky met first with Giuliani: \u201cWe are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTrump \u201cpraised\u201d the current prosecutor.\n\nTrump does not specifically mention Yuriy Lutsenko, who was on the outs with Zelensky and removed from office the next month. Trump offers praise, however, for an unnamed prosecutor: \u201cA lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved.\u201d Trump also said: \u201cI heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything.\u201d\n\nTrump only discussed \u201ccorruption cases\u201d involving Biden and the DNC.\n\nTrue. The whistleblower noted that the official Ukrainian readout of the call said Trump asked Zelensky to \u201ccomplete the investigation of corruption cases that have held back cooperation between Ukraine and the United States.\u201d He wrote that, aside from Biden and the 2016 election, \u201cI was told by White House officials that no other \u2018cases\u2019 were discussed.\u201d This is confirmed by the rough White House transcript; no other \u201ccorruption cases\u201d were discussed.\n\nWhat\u2019s unconfirmed\n\nA specific State Department official was on the call.\n\nThe whistleblower said that \u201cI was told that a State Department official, Mr. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, also listened in on the call.\u201d Brechbuhl is State Department counselor and reports to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. His participation has not been confirmed, but Pompeo has acknowledged being on the call. Pompeo, of course, is more senior than Brechbuhl.\n\nTrump suggested Lutsenko should be retained.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s praise for a \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201cvery fair\u201d prosecutor, the available version of the transcript shows he did not suggest that Lutsenko be retained.\n\nII. Efforts to restrict access to records related to the call\n\nWhat\u2019s confirmed\n\nOfficials intervened to \u201clock down\u201d records of the call.\n\nThe whistleblower said that \u201cthe transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature.\u201d The White House has confirmed this is true. He added that \u201cthis set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\u201d CNN has reported that \u201cat least one National Security Council official alerted the White House\u2019s national security lawyers about the concerns,\u201d and then the White House\u2019s national security lawyers ordered the transcript to be moved \u201cto prevent more people from seeing it.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s unconfirmed\n\nThere was a \u201cword-for-word\u201d transcript.\n\nThe rough transcript released by the White House has a warning note that it is not verbatim. Given that there are ellipses in the document, not common in official White House summaries, it\u2019s unclear if there is a more complete version available.\n\nIII. Ongoing concerns\n\nWhat\u2019s confirmed\n\nU.S. envoy Volker\u2019s role\n\nThe whistleblower said U.S. envoy Kurt Volker, the special representative for Ukraine negotiations, visited Kiev the day after the call and \u201cprovided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the President had made of Mr. Zelenskyy.\u201d (Zelenskyy is a different transliteration of Zelensky.) The complaint also highlighted the role of U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, a Trump campaign contributor who ordinarily would not be expected to have a role in Ukraine policy matters. All of these elements have since been confirmed by Volker in his testimony before Congress and public records.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s travel and interactions\n\nThe whistleblower said Giuliani met Aug. 2 in Madrid with a Zelensky adviser and reached out to other aides as well. The Madrid meeting had not been publicly disclosed at the time; Volker and Giuliani have confirmed it.\n\nIV. Circumstances leading up to the 25 July presidential phone call\n\nWhat\u2019s confirmed\n\nThe ambassador was recalled under \u201cpressure.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower alleged that career diplomat Marie Yovanovitch was recalled early from her position as ambassador to Ukraine because of her conflicts with Lutsenko and his poor record of fighting corruption. Lutsenko made some public allegations that were amplified by Giuliani and conservative media outlets. At the time, \u201cMr. Lutsenko\u2019s political patron, President Poroshenko, was trailing Mr. Zelenskyy in the polls and appeared likely to be defeated.\u201d Subsequent reporting has uncovered that Yovanovitch was recalled on Trump\u2019s orders.\n\nOfficials were concerned about Giuliani\u2019s \u201ccircumvention\u201d of foreign policy.\n\nThe whistleblower reported that \u201cstarting in mid-May\u201d he heard from \u201cmultiple U.S. officials that they were deeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani\u2019s circumvention of national security decisionmaking processes to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth between Kyiv and the President.\u201d The Washington Post reported there was \u201ca months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists \u2014 including the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani \u2014 to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev.\u201d CNN disclosed that in a May 23 meeting Trump \u201cdirected Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and two top State Department officials to deal with his private attorney Rudy Giuliani when the Ukrainian President sought to meet Trump, in a clear circumvention of official channels.\u201d\n\nA phone call or meeting with Trump depended on whether Zelensky was willing to \u201cplay ball.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower wrote that this was \u201cthe general understanding of the state of affairs,\u201d but he did not know who delivered the message. Volker\u2019s testimony and various text messages released by Congress, however, confirm this allegation.\n\nFor instance, in a text message ahead of the July 25 phone call, Volker told an adviser to Zelensky: \u201cHeard from White House \u2014 assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck! See you tomorrow \u2014 kurt.\u201d And Andrey Yermak, an aide to Zelensky, wrote in an Aug. 10 message to Volker: \u201cOnce we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling investigations.\u201d (Burisma Holdings is the Ukrainian gas company where Hunter Biden had been a board member from 2014 to 2019.)\n\n(U) Additional information related to Section II\n\nWhat\u2019s confirmed\n\nVice President Pence canceled plans to attend Zelensky\u2019s inauguration.\n\nTrue. The Washington Post reported: \u201cTrump instructed Pence not to attend the inauguration of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in May \u2014 an event White House officials had pushed to put on the vice president\u2019s calendar \u2014 when Ukraine\u2019s new leader was seeking recognition and support from Washington,\u201d according to current and former U.S. officials.\n\nIn mid-July, Trump suspended all U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.\n\nTrue. Trump confirmed he had done so but insisted it was unrelated to Biden. Instead, he claimed he wanted European nations to pony up more funds for Ukraine. (European nations already contribute more to Ukraine than the United States.) In the complaint, the whistleblower does not link the security assistance to Trump\u2019s demands \u2014 \u201cI do not know definitively whether the below-mentioned decisions are connected to the broader efforts I describe\u201d \u2014 but he notes that U.S. officials \u201cwere unaware of a policy rationale.\u201d\n\nThat has been confirmed by subsequent reporting, though in one instance a top diplomat privately thought there was a link between the aid and the requested Biden probe: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d wrote Bill Taylor, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires to Ukraine, in September to Sondland. Sondland replied there was no quid pro quo and the two should stop texting about it. Nevertheless, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has said that Sondland also told him that release of the aid was contingent upon Ukraine opening the requested investigations \u2014 but that Trump denied it when Johnson asked him if that was true.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nIt will be up to Congress to determine whether Trump has been \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\u201d as the whistleblower alleged. But thus far, with the exception of some minor details, virtually all of the specific points of the complaint have held up and been confirmed. Trump has no basis to claim the whistleblower complaint is \u201cvery inaccurate.\u201d The president earns Four Pinocchios.\n\nFour Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "description": "A line-by-line review of the whistleblower complaint shows that virtually every key element has been subsequently confirmed as correct.", "authors": ["Glenn Kessler", "The Fact Checker", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4sF0JcFiSVrgdp34bwKQxz_nqss=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PVPV34QZQ5BE3AOM7LO5T6U3G4", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
