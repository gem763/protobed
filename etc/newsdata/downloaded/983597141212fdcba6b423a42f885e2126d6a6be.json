Everybody take a valium!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not bad advice in 2019. Canada\u2019s reputation is for \u201chonest trading, good skiing conditions,\u201d in the words of the late novelist Mordecai Richler. But the recent election results point to something else \u2014 Canada as a morass of regional resentments.\n\nThere\u2019s talk of Western separation \u2013 Wexit it\u2019s called, naturally \u2013 as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Justin Pierre James TrudeauSaagar Enjeti: Biden campaign on verge of an 'imminent political collapse' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Trump's impeachment plea to Republicans Trudeau to serve another term as prime minister after Liberals win plurality MORE\u2019s efforts to combat climate change left his Liberal Party shut out of energy-rich Alberta and Saskatchewan. Meanwhile, sons and daughters of the forces of 1976 \u2013 their party now is more nationalist than separatist \u2013 fought the Liberals to a draw in Quebec.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut crisis? This is the natural state of affairs. Canada was built atop fault-lines; linguistic and regional primarily.\n\nWe get by. To manage, Canada is one of the world\u2019s most decentralized federations. More than three-quarters of government spending is doled out by provinces and municipalities versus less than half in the United States and less still across the rest of the industrialized world.\n\nIt was Trudeau\u2019s father, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, who thought this unnatural, warning of a day when the prime minister\u2019s role would be as \u201chead waiter to the provinces.\u201d\n\nSo, what does the present prime minister do now in a parliament where he holds only a plurality of seats instead of the solid majority of the past four years? How does Justin Trudeau stay afloat and try to bring together a polarized country when opposition politicians put the blame solely on him?\n\nAs with any good plan, it involves tactics and strategy \u2014 tactics regarding Trudeau\u2019s behavior, strategy regarding his government\u2019s policies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrudeau has admitted that he tries to stay above the fray. He\u2019ll have to get his hands dirty.\n\nThere are things only a prime minister can settle, especially with leaders of the other parties who, together, control the workings of power, such as parliamentary committees. He\u2019s starting as he should by talking with each of them one-on-one to learn their priorities and to try to game out an agenda, as well as by talking with provincial and municipal leaders.\n\nHe needs to continue to listen more, and possibly speak less. His carbon tax might have been more palatable to Western Canadians if he hadn\u2019t mused too about a future without oil. (Energy is Canada\u2019s largest export.) Westerners argued that Trudeau would never suggest something similar about, say, Ontario\u2019s critical auto industry.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that Trudeau\u2019s government will be voted down imminently. The main opposition party, the Conservatives, may re-start what they do best: internecine warfare. The other parties have financial troubles or think they\u2019re probably at their high-water mark.\n\nSo, Trudeau likely has at least two years to set himself up for a shot at another majority government. What should his agenda be?\n\nMore home, less away. Trudeau likes the international stage, but he draws fire for liking it too much. He must focus on the machinery of government in Ottawa, the dull capital. Canada\u2019s global presence may not slide, but his own likely will.\n\nAccelerate infrastructure development. Trudeau\u2019s plan to increase much-needed spending remains popular, but projects have been rolled out too slowly and are too often politically-driven. The Conservatives erred by wanting to spend less. Trudeau should choose better and spend faster, especially on transit in major cities, like Toronto.\n\nGet the pipeline built. Energy and the environment are spoken here as if they\u2019re one long word. This is quixotic to partisans on each side. But to political realists it\u2019s the only path forward: A permanent carbon tax is possible only with calibrated oil development, especially by expanding a key pipeline to the West Coast (and on to Asia, which pays more than U.S. markets).\n\nStay the course on Aboriginal development. Trudeau\u2019s rhetoric set expectations too high, but Canadians are recognizing the impact of their colonial history. Even now, while Canada ranks among the top countries on the UN Human Development Index, Aboriginal Canadians rank with the likes of Venezuela and Azerbaijan.\n\nBe serious about competitiveness. Canada\u2019s technology sectors are growing but the economy remains too dependent on resources. And too few companies are global. The Liberal government should open protected markets and cull regulations, which can vary among provinces.\n\nAdvance the next social program. Canada was an early adopter of government-funded health care. But the system is looking creaky as costs rise faster for prescription drugs, which aren\u2019t generally covered, than for visits to doctors and hospitals, which are. The Liberal Party has promised action for years; now\u2019s the time.\n\nDiscretion is the better part of valor. Trudeau is being urged to intervene in a court challenge of a Quebec law banning public servants \u2013 such as teachers and police officers \u2013 from wearing religious symbols on the job. The law is popular in French-speaking Quebec for protecting secular values but is unpopular among English-speaking Canadians for undermining religious freedoms. Trudeau should step gingerly.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s election victory \u2013 though one that plays in a minor key \u2013 will require of him a newfound discipline of power. Act Two is just beginning.\n\nDrew Fagan is a professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto.", "description": "Trudeau\u2019s election victory \u2013 though one that plays in a minor key \u2013 will require of him a newfound discipline of power.
