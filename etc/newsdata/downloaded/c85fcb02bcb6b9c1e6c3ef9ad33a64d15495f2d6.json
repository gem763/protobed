The Oracle shopping mall in Reading, England had entered into a six-month pilot period with the American fast food chain, but announced Friday \u2014 only eight days after the fast food restaurant\u2019s grand opening \u2014 that it would not be renewing the lease, according to the BBC.\n\n\u201cAt the Oracle, we offer an inclusive space where everyone is welcome,\u201d said a spokesperson for The Oracle in a statement to TIME. \u201cWe always look to introduce new concepts for our customers, however, we have decided on this occasion that the right thing to do is to only allow Chick-fil-A to trade with us for the initial six month pilot period, and not to extend the lease any further.\u201d\n\nA Chick-fil-A spokesperson, however, says the company always intended to only be at in Reading for that six month pilot. \u201cWe have been very pleased with what we\u2019ve seen in the U.K. in terms of customer response to our food and our approach to customer service,\u201d a spokesperson for Chick-fil-A said in a statement to TIME. \u201cWe mutually agreed to a six month lease with the Oracle Mall in Reading as part of a longer term strategy for us as we look to expand our international presence.\u201d\n\nChick-fil-A, an Atlanta-based company that has often made headlines for heartwarming stories of customer service, is owned by a family who, in 2012, faced backlash for their ties to millions of dollars of donations to anti-LGBTQ causes. The chain\u2019s owners have publicly stated they support the \u201cbiblical definition of marriage.\u201d WinShape Foundation, the owner\u2019s charity foundation, had also donated $1,000 to Exodus International, according to tax records obtained by Equality Matters, an LGBT advocacy organization. Exodus International closed in 2013, but had been a proponent of conversion therapy.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.
