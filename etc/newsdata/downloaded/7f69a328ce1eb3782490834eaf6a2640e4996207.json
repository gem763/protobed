House Democrats later released text messages in which U.S. diplomats discussed investigations in Ukraine and new details continue emerging as the impeachment story dominates the news cycle.\n\nWhile State Department press secretary Morgan Ortagus and her team continue to field questions on diplomatic and foreign policy issues, reporters have been directed to put Ukraine-specific requests to Katie Martin, a deputy assistant secretary for media strategy who joined in March from the National Republican Senatorial Committee. But reporters say their questions rarely yield answers, and often go unacknowledged.\n\n\"The requests kind of disappear into the ether,\" said a third reporter. And this lack of clarity from the administration, the reporter said, hampers journalists' ability \u201cto explain what is happening to the American public.\u201d\n\nShaun Tandon, an AFP reporter who serves as president of the State Department Correspondents\u2019 Association, told POLITICO that they have brought concerns to senior department officials.\n\n\u201cWe want them to acknowledge our questions and to have some kind of standard way for us to reach out to them,\u201d he said.\n\nMartin did not respond to a request for comment from POLITICO.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s quite frustrating with the impeachment inquiry is it involves the State Department very much at this point, with former and current diplomats being called for depositions,\u201d said Tandon. \u201cWe hear things on the Hill, the White House is speaking quite a bit, and we have essentially nothing from the State Department.\"\n\nEarlier this week, reporters were informed that the State Department ordered Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, not to testify before Congress. That information came from Sondland\u2019s personal attorney, not the State Department.\n\nThe lapse was unusual because the department -- whose public information office is widely viewed as the most professional in the government, accustomed to dealing with issues of international sensitivity \u2013 has been forthcoming on other matters. This week, State Department officials briefed reporters off-camera on changes to the U.S. policy in Syria.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pompeo sat down with PBS NewsHour anchor Judy Woodruff to make clear that the administration opposes the Turkish assault on northern Syria. Pompeo answered Woodruff\u2019s questions on other topics, including on Ukraine, though at one point suggested the journalist worked for the Democratic National Committee after she suggested \u201cthere\u2019s been no proof of any misdoing on the part of Vice President Biden\u201d with respect to his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nPast administrations have, at times, separated questions about global policy issues from a fast-moving crisis or controversy, especially if there political implications. Under President Barack Obama, the department assigned certain officials to field questions on hot-button topics like WikiLeaks, the Benghazi attack, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. But the expectation was that the issue-specific spokesperson, or team, would be able to respond more urgently and with the latest information, to reporters\u2019 inquiries. That has not happened under the Trump administration, reporters said.\n\nThe concerns about responsiveness on Ukraine and impeachment-related matters come as Ortagus\u2019s on-camera press briefings, which returned in May after a hiatus, remain a rarity. The last on-camera briefing was held on Sept. 12, though officials did brief reporters off-camera last month at United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nThe White House press secretary hasn\u2019t held a formal, on-camera briefing in more than six months, though Trump regularly takes questions from reporters, while the Pentagon went more than a year without conducting one.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5e/23/cc472f45402e83974f591ab0f294/191011-mike-pompeo-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
