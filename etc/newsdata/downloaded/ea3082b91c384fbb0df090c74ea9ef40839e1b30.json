I felt slightly detached from it at certain points because otherwise I'd have been a blubbering wreck,\" she said.\n\n\"It was only when it was completed it sank in what it was. That her dad would be holding her hand on her wedding day.\"\n\nImage copyright Charlotte Watson Image caption Mick Barber had been looking forward to his daughter's wedding\n\nCharlotte said she \"couldn't believe\" the finished result, which was a pink, grey and white design finished off with gems.\n\nShe had been planning to walk down the aisle alone but the night before the wedding in Congleton in August, she asked her mum to accompany her.\n\nHer dad was included in the day in many other ways, including in pictures on the back of her shoes, in a pendant attached to her flowers and a teddy made from one of his jumpers and a pair of jeans.\n\nImage copyright Cara Green Image caption Charlotte said it felt like her dad was by her side as she married Nick Watson\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, and sign up for local news updates direct to your phone.", "description": "Mick Barber died four months before Charlotte got married, but was still with her on the big day.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12D72/production/_109107177_a1079981-a406-42da-a84b-33069688e605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
