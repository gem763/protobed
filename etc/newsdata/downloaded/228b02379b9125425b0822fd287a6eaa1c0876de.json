The pound reached a five-week high on Thursday as investors reacted to the diminishing likelihood of the UK crashing out of the EU.\n\nHowever, MPs and peers cannot legally block a departure from the EU without a deal and major companies are warning the political turbulence is harming business confidence ahead of the slated exit date of 31 October.\n\n\u201cBusinesses do not want to see a messy and disorderly Brexit, but ongoing uncertainty means they must prepare for all possibilities as the October deadline looms,\u201d said the BCC\u2019s director general, Adam Marshall, after the survey of 1,500 firms , mainly small and medium-sized enterprises, was published.\n\nJust over a third of businesses conducted a Brexit assessment last year. The BCC welcomed the rise, but cautioned a large proportion of firms were not prepared for the potential impact of a \u201cchaotic exit\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile more firms have taken basic steps to prepare for change than was the case last year, and government has stepped up communication to businesses, ongoing uncertainty makes business planning with confidence next to impossible,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cCompanies are told to plan but are being presented with a moving target.\n\n\u201cLow levels of awareness around special customs and trade schemes are of particular concern, as this highlights the potential for disruption at borders in an unwanted no-deal situation. Companies should be automatically enrolled or supported to enrol in these schemes to increase trader readiness.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOur evidence yet again reinforces the importance of averting a chaotic exit on October 31st.\u201d\n\nThe BCC added there were many areas without \u201cclear and actionable\u201d information to help businesses mitigate the worst effects of a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cWhile there has been an increase in the guidance available from government on conditions in a no deal, the advice needs to be clearer and more consistent.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy told the BBC that supporting businesses to \u201cget ready for Brexit on 31 October, and take advantage of the opportunities of leaving the EU\u201d was the department\u2019s top priority, with an additional \u00a3108m in funding support announced recently.", "description": "Survey showing high proportion of firms unprepared shows dangers of no deal, says BCC", "authors": ["Mattha Busby"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fcacc309dd24b9966a01937c04a1dbd364b6df4/219_0_3281_1969/master/3281.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=38a2a7057251cbd815aee4d7ff9aa947", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
