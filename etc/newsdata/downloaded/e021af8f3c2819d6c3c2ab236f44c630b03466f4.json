(Vanessa Costa/Radio-Canada)\n\nD'Aoust said she wants Elections Canada workers to receive training on how to handle complaints from transgender people who need to fix their cards.\n\nSuch mistakes are not only far from innocuous for transgender people \u2014 they're also a bit bizarre, given the scope of modern information technology, said Marie-Pier Boisvert, director-general for Conseil qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois LGBT.\n\n\"How is it that, with today's computer systems, this isn't settled?\" she asked.\n\nMore than 3 million changes per year\n\nAccording to Elections Canada, the national register of electors contains the records of nearly 27 million Canadians and the information of about 14 per cent of them \u2014 more than three million people \u2014 changes each year.\n\nThe national register gathers data through sources such as licensing authorities, provincial and territorial registries, provincial and territorial lists of electors and Revenue Canada.\n\nElections Canada says one way voters can fix cards with incorrect information is by having the changes made at polling stations on the day of the federal election. (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press)\n\nHowever, some of those sources may provide erroneous or outdated information or experience delays in sending along the correct information, said Elections Canada spokesperson Natasha Gauthier.\n\nAny changes to first names and genders are entered manually to \"ensure data integrity,\" Gauthier said.", "description": "A handful of transgender people in the Ottawa-Gatineau region have received voter information cards with the wrong name and gender \u2014 and at least one voter\u00a0says it could influence the decision to cast a ballot in this month's federal election.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5314806.1570712275!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/voting-transgender-gender.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
