Points are awarded to people who are particularly 'proficient' while even more are awarded to those deemed 'superior'.\n\nThen there are qualifications and skilled employment history. This is where people must get most of their points from.\n\nFor example, five years of skilled work outside Australia is worth 10 points and a PHD qualification receives 20 points.\n\nIn a blunt, no nonsense speech at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on October 2, Ms Patel said: 'As Home Secretary at this defining moment in our country\u2019s history, I have a particular responsibility when it comes to taking back control.\n\n'It is to end the free movement of people once and for all.'\n\n'Instead we will introduce an Australian style points-based immigration system.\n\n'One that works in the best interests of Britain. One that attracts and welcomes the brightest and the best.\n\n'One that supports brilliant scientists, the finest academics and leading people in their fields. And one that is under the control of the British Government.'\n\nThe Home Secretary has arranged for Australian government officials to fly over to help implement the new system. Earlier this month she met Peter Dutton, her Australian counterpart, while both ministers were in the US for talks with Donald Trump\u2019s administration.", "description": "Plans for an Australian-style points system are set to be introduced\u00a0in the Queen's Speech after hardline Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed to block freedom of movement 'once and for all'.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/10/19683762-0-image-a-2_1571044218278.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
