The action came amid reports that Pompeo listened in on President Donald Trump\u2019s July phone call pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cWe have been clear: We will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections,\u201d Pompeo said in a statement. \u201cThe United States will continue to push back against malign actors who seek to subvert our democratic processes.\u201d\n\nThe target of economic sanctions by the Treasury Department was an online troll factory called the Internet Research Agency. Named were six employees and company financier Yevgeny Prigozhin. The sanctions target Prigozhin\u2019s yacht, three private jets and front companies.\n\nThough Pompeo warned the Russians, he listened in on Trump\u2019s July 25 call to the Ukrainian president pushing him repeatedly to launch an investigation into Biden and his son, according to several media reports. Trump was withholding nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid while he pressed a cause that could affect the 2020 election. The call has become the focus of a formal House impeachment inquiry.\n\nJust a week ago, Pompeo also said he supported efforts by Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to press an investigation by Ukrainian officials into former Vice President Biden.\n\nGiuliani and Trump have been pushing a baseless conspiracy theory that Democratic National Committee emails were hacked during the 2016 campaign by Ukrainians \u2014 not Russians, as U.S. intelligence officials have determined. The cyberattack was somehow part of a plot \u2014 also linked to Biden \u2014 that attempted to sway the election for the Democrats, Giuliani has claimed.\n\nTom Bossert, a former homeland security adviser to Trump, said Sunday on ABC that the Ukraine theory is \u201ccompletely false.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not only a conspiracy theory, it is completely debunked.\u201d\n\nPompeo, however, appeared to give credence to the conspiracy when he backed Giuliani\u2019s activities in Ukraine pressing officials for information \u2014 even though the attorney has no role in the federal government.\n\n\u201cIf there was election interference that took place by the vice president, I think the American people deserve to know,\u201d Pompeo said on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nTrump referenced the cyberattack theory in his phone call to Ukraine\u2019s president.", "description": "\u201cWe have been clear: We will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections,\u201d the secretary of state said after new economic sanctions were announced.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d92b0002100002e00f8c3d4.jpeg?cache=qz4cfjxefr&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
