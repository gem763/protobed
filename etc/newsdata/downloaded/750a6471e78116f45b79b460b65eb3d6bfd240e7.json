Peter Rae\n\n\"The regulator is pulling boards in one direction but the investor community are rejecting that approach, so it is putting boards in an invidious position,\" AICD CEO Angus Armour said.\n\nThe AICD said the \"unworkable tension\" was \"compounded by the lack of any clear consensus on acceptable non-financial metrics that should be used\".\n\n\"We are concerned that the more prescriptive elements in the standard may ultimately work against APRA\u2019s objectives,\" it said.\n\nIt also raised concerns about the deferral of variable remuneration for up to seven years and the clawback of bonuses for up to four years, arguing that this was out of line with the EU and UK.\n\nThe directors' club is also deeply concerned at the proposal for boards to approve and actively oversee remuneration policies for a wider group of executives, in some cases adding up to 100 more employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAngus Armour says APRA's prescriptive approach will not work. Peter Rae\n\n\"The more time they ask boards to invest in direct line of sight on pay, the more it takes away from the critical focus on strategy and broader risks,\" Mr Armour said. \"The level of prescription is not going to work.\"\n\nThe big banks and the Australian Banking Association have also lodged submissions but said they would wait for APRA to release their views.\n\nHowever, bank sources said they had raised similar concerns to those raised by investors and directors.", "description": "APRA's plan to overhaul bank bonuses is unworkable and likely to backfire, the peak body for company directors warns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2853%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_167/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0be715db1ad091965e8c06d95d4b22618fb8e6b1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
