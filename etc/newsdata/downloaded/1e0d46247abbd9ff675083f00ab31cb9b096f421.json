Since the 1930s, it has helped grow the U.S. economy and foil unfairly aggressive foreign competitors. However, due mostly to recent politics, it hasn\u2019t been fully functioning since 2014. This needs to change \u2014 for many reasons.\n\nFirst, according to Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe, the country\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is absolutely a part of its military plans. This comes after years of the Chinese Communist Party insisting the worldwide infrastructure scheme is only focused on economics and international cooperation. Wei plainly said future Chinese military cooperation would fit \"within the framework of BRI.\"\n\nJOHN STOSSEL: TRUMP SUCCEEDS AS DEREGULATOR IN CHIEF, BUT HIS TARIFFS AND FARM SUBSIDIES COUNTER HIS EFFORTS\n\nThis is a big deal. According to Ex-Im Bank reports, the BRI system includes about 30 percent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product and impacts more than 66 percent of the world\u2019s population. China\u2019s Export-Import Bank alone has participated in more than 1,800 projects with a loan value in excess of $149 billion. If China links the economic might of the BRI with its military (the Communist Party-controlled People\u2019s Liberation Army boasts 2 million troops) U.S. national security would be seriously threatened.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAs I discuss in my upcoming book, \"Trump vs China: Facing America\u2019s Greatest Threat,\" one way that the Chinese Communist Party imposes its will through the BRI is through so-called \u201cdebt-trap diplomacy.\u201d It is a clear strategy to gain leverage and influence over countries that owe China for massive infrastructure loans.\n\nThis is how it works: China offers large loans to smaller, poorer countries in exchange for the country\u2019s bolstering of Beijing\u2019s strategic interests. Then, China takes control of the assets built with the money \u2014 ports, airfields, etc. \u2014 when the smaller countries can\u2019t cover the debt.\n\nFor one example, Sri Lanka signed a 99-year lease of its Hambantota port facilities over to China after it couldn\u2019t pay China back for its initial loan. Right now, according to Ex-Im reports, eight more countries owe China. Two of these, Djibouti and the Maldives, are critical to China\u2019s Maritime Silk Road (the BRI\u2019s maritime route).\n\nAgain, this is not exclusively an economic strategy. The Wall Street Journal reported in late July that the Chinese were holding secret negotiations for exclusive military access to a part of the Ream naval base in Cambodia for the next three decades. The base is on the Gulf of Thailand and represents an important strategic point from which China could project power and influence in the South China Sea. This sort of activity is happening everywhere. For example, there are at least 46 existing or planned Chinese port projects in sub-Saharan Africa, as well.\n\nAt the same time, China is working to make sure its domestic industries can dominate. The \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d strategic plan seeks to replace imported or acquired technology across 10 advanced manufacturing sectors and at least 70 percent Chinese domestic content by 2025 for certain products. (Keep in mind, it will probably do so by stealing the intellectual property of the imported technology and creating Chinese versions.)\n\nMany of these technologies have both civilian and military uses. This is not simply about continuing to dominate small electronics and cell phone manufacturing. This effort by China poses a potentially serious threat to our national security. According to the Pentagon, the dual-use nature of the Made in China 2025 program directly supports Chinese military modernization goals by stressing proprietary mastery of these technologies.\n\nFinally, China uses its export credit agencies (ECAs) as a strategic arm for its \u201cdebt-trap diplomacy\u201d \u2014 and the U.S. is not maintaining pace to counter the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s influence. In 2018, China\u2019s official ECAs outpaced the Ex-Im Bank by more than 100 fold (in terms of the amount of medium- to long-term credit it extended). That year, America was 25th in the world for such credit \u2014 a mere 0.2 percent of the market. So, compared to the United States, China is spending more, gaining more influence, and more quickly improving its economic and military positions across the globe.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s National Security Strategy rightly identifies economic security as national security. Clearly, the Chinese Communist Party is eroding U.S. economic influence abroad. The Ex-Im is one of our best tools to prevent this and keep America strong.\n\nCongress should reauthorize the Ex-Im bank, so we can compete against the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s economic strategy of world domination. The Ex-Im bank can level the playing field for U.S. businesses, help them be more competitive, and ultimately help them create more U.S. jobs. All the while, we will be strengthening our national security. For example, Ex-Im can help bolster the president\u2019s \"Prosper\" Africa initiative \u2014 which would directly compete with China\u2019s aggressive activity there. This would be good for the U.S. economically, militarily, and diplomatically.\n\nThe Ex-Im Bank\u2019s charter is set to expire soon. There is an effort in Congress proposed by Sens. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., to renew the charter for 10 years. This is exactly what should happen.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWithout EXIM, there is no practical, clear way to compete against the ever-expanding Chinese economic-military machine. If we do nothing, the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s power will grow, our economic and national security interests will diminish, and our very way of life could be consumed by a totalitarian system.\n\nThis is not an acceptable outcome if we wish to remain the strongest, freest, most prosperous country on the planet.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY NEWT GINGRICH", "description": "Without the bank, there is no practical, clear way to compete against the ever-expanding Chinese economic-military machine.", "authors": ["Newt Gingrich", "Former Speaker Of The U.S. House Of Representatives Newt Gingrich Is The Host Of The"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/17/694940094001_6095499561001_6095501784001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
