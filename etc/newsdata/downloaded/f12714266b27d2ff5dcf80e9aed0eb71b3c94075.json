Now he\u2019s showing up to events in sweatpants and orthopedic sneakers, listening to Kenny G and trying to get Black people to like Trump. It\u2019s like, how long before this guy changes his name to Kathy?\u201d\n\nChe then segued into a joke about Jenner, who came out as transgender in 2015 and used to be married to West\u2019s mother-in-law.\n\n\u201cNow, you might think that I\u2019m crazy, but about five years ago, there was a fella named Bruce Jenner, and he moved to Calabasas \u2026 \u201d the SNL comedian said before trailing off.\n\nMany people weren\u2019t happy, not with the misgendering of Jenner, not with the casual use of her dead name and not with the implication that being transgender is inherently amusing.\n\nTrans women are women #SNL, even Caitlyn Jenner. \u2014 Nina Wurz (@NinaWurz) October 27, 2019\n\nMichael Che about to try out the transphobic joke he was working on all week pic.twitter.com/IffXdKyMRN \u2014 Will Long\u2728 (@Willful_long) October 27, 2019\n\nCaitlyn Jenner jokes in 2019. Keep crushing it, SNL. Truly innovative stuff from Michael Che. \u2014 Justin Martin (@jmartinwrites) October 27, 2019\n\nhow come jenny slate says fuck one time on air but michael che can constantly make shitty jokes about minorities and he\u2019s still on air? @nbcsnl \u2014 zoe (@zoentltc) October 27, 2019\n\nMaybe I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that @nbcsnl needs to be reminded that trans people should not be a punchline. Really really disappointed that the writers relied on such a hateful and lazy joke. \u2014 Elizabeth (@ElizabethAJRM) October 28, 2019\n\nHi @nbcsnl, please note that deadnaming and intentional misgendering is a form of transphobic violence. I'm so done with transphobic humor on #SNL ==> Michael Che Deadnames Caitlyn Jenner, Calls Her \u201cFella,\u201d on \u201cSNL\u201d https://t.co/4dxavYDALF via @NewNowNext \u2014 Danielle Solzman (@DanielleSATM) October 28, 2019\n\n#SNL Disappointed that the trans community was made fun of on national TV. Poor choice and bad joke. Michael Che we deserve an apology. \u2014 Rochelle Hill (@RochelleHill46) October 28, 2019\n\n#SNL with a dumb set of Trans jokes culminating in a Caitlynn Jenner joke that had the audience audibly going \"Oh no...\".\n\nAgain: Comedy that punches down ain't funny and never will be. \u2014 Kevin D. Gr\u00fcssing (Pronounced Grew-Sing) (@KevDGrussing) October 27, 2019\n\ncis ppl! i know this is hard to understand but implying someone is trans to be funny tells me that you think my identity is a joke :) @nbcsnl do better \u2014 goblin man (@discountsquash) October 27, 2019\n\nMichael Che and snl I luv u so so much but as a trans person that Caitlyn Jenner joke was...not cool \u2014 spooky trans lady (@advokatalina) October 28, 2019\n\nHuffPost reached out to Che for comment but did not receive an immediate response.
