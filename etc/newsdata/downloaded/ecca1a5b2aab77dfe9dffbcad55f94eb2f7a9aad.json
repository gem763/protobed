If she was deported to Iran, \u201cthey will kill me,\u201d she said.\n\nMarkk Perete, undersecretary at the Philippine department of justice, said that \u201cthe only reason she was held at the airport - and we really don\u2019t call it detention - it is really restraining her from entering the Philippine territory, is only because of that Red Notice issued against her.\u201d\n\nHe added that the request had been made \u201cpresumably on account of a pending criminal case against her in Iran, and this case was filed by an Iranian national against her in relation to an assault that happened presumably here in the Philippines.\u201d\n\nBahareh Zare Bahari, who is studying dental medicine, is an outspoken advocate for women's rights Credit: Facebook More\n\nHowever, Mr Perete said that the Philippines was unaware of this allegation, and that an earlier accusation of commercial fraud against her had been dismissed.\n\nThere were no criminal cases pending against Ms Bahari, he confirmed. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any cause for refusing her entry for violation of our laws.\u201d\n\nMs Bahari\u2019s asylum plea is now being considered by the justice department, with the help of a lawyer.\n\nMeanwhile, the dental student is confined to Terminal 3\u2019s transit area awaiting her fate. \u201cThere is no updating, no information about the reason why [they] keep me here so long,\u201d she said.\n\nShe believes her political statement at the pageant - waving a poster of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled former crown prince, and one of the foremost critics of Iran\u2019s Islamic government - made her enemies in Tehran.\n\nMr Pahlavi's name has been invoked by some Iranian groups who have called for a return of the monarchy to deal with corruption and poor economic conditions.\n\n\u201cI used his photo on stage to be [the] voice of my people because all news and media are ignoring my people,\u201d she said.\n\nHuman Rights Watch on Tuesday called for \u201ca fair and impartial hearing of her claim\u201d in Manila.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely critical the Philippines provides Bahareh Zare Bahari with support, including access to legal counsel, to compile and file her asylum application,\u201d said Phil Robertson, HRW deputy Asia director.\n\n\u201cWhile waiting for the details to become clear, there should be no action under Iran\u2019s Interpol red notice, especially since under Interpol rules a red notice is null and void if the person named in the notice is found to be a refugee fleeing from the state that issued it.\u201d", "description": "An Iranian beauty queen is seeking asylum in the Philippines, fearing for her life after Tehran\u00a0demanded her extradition for a crime she claims she did not commit.\u00a0 Bahareh Zare Bahari, who represented Iran at the 2018 Miss Intercontinental pageant in Manila, and who has studied dental medicine in the", "authors": ["Nicola Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OuDSXrI8RZE8B5tpApYytA--~B/aD02MTA7dz05NzY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/d7889da5b7828ac591d323cbc13fad9d", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
