Courtesy of Isaac Nemzer\n\nThe 62,000 members of this urbanist Facebook group are doing more than just making weird memes. (But they are making a lot of weird memes.)\n\nIt might have begun, as many things do, with Robert Moses\u2014or a meme about him, anyway. \u201cNice neighborhood you\u2019ve got there,\u201d read the bold-faced all-caps text on a portrait of the infamous city planner. \u201cSure would be a shame if someone put a highway through it.\u201d This was in February 2017. Juliet Eldred, at the time a senior at the University of Chicago studying geography, cross-posted the meme into a popular Facebook group she\u2019d made for sharing GIS and mapping humor. \u201cFOLLOW FOR MORE RELATABLE ROBERT MOSES MEMES,\u201d she wrote in the post. Her geography classmate and friend, Emily Orenstein, replied with a screenshot of a Reddit-like comment thread of enthusiastic expletives\u2014a Weird Facebook sign of approval, apparently. A few weeks later, Orenstein posted again, drawing sides in the ultimate rivalry of 20th-century urbanism: HEART REACC FOR JANE JACOBS\n\nANGERY REACC FOR ROBERT MOSES \u201cREAL URBANIST HOURS WHO UP,\u201d replied Eldred, posting a \u201cheart\u201d reaction. It was late at night, during midterms. Jonathan Marty, then a sophomore at New York University majoring in urban studies, chimed in: \u201ctbh where are all of the jane jacobs/robert moses meme groups??\u201d\n\nWithin days, \u201cNew Urbanist Memes For Transit-Oriented Teens\u201d was born. A detail of a transit-style \u201cmap\u201d directing NUMTOT members to the natural endpoints of their discourse. (Courtesy of Mitchell Sheldrick) Actually, no: The original name for Facebook\u2019s greatest fount of city-planning snark was \u201cNew Urbanist Shitposting.\u201d Its current moniker\u2014shortened to NUMTOT by those in the know\u2014came soon after, as a handful of members began dunking on road-widening projects and comparing transit systems via meme. \u201cIt was not meant to be anything serious,\u201d Eldred, who now works for a transportation consulting firm in Boston, said earlier this month. Yeah, but as they say on the internet: Life comes at you fast. One year later, the group has more than 62,000 members, with representation on every continent but Antarctica. The Transit-Oriented Teens seem to be mostly in their early twenties; there are undergrads and Ph.D. students, planning and GIS professionals, and pretty much anyone else who\u2019s \u201cgay for public transport,\u201d to use a favorite NUMTOT expression. It is, in short, the premier social-media watering hole for young wonks who relish displays of high intellectualism disguised in low humor, and the endless potential for one-ups therein. \u201cThere\u2019s something so striking about a meme that says, \u2018bae come over,\u2019 and it\u2019s a photo of a train,\u201d said Marty. Per Eldred\u2019s estimation, the TOTs generate 100 to 150 posts per day. What gets shared nowadays are mostly news articles and links, but urban-y riffs on Thomas the Tank Engine, the peak performance guy, and the rest of the internet\u2019s strange cast of meme characters are still in the mix. Including a lot of appreciation for transit. \u201cThere\u2019s something so striking about a meme that says, \u2018bae come over,\u2019 and it\u2019s a photo of a train,\u201d said Marty, now a junior and one of the group\u2019s lead administrators alongside Eldred and Orenstein. \u201cIt\u2019s this weird juxtaposition of the nerdy world of subway models and zoning laws, plus that internet humor.\u201d\n\nFor those uncertain about what that humor is, understand that that\u2019s part of it\u2014a lot of memes are like inside jokes, produced by connoisseurs of a certain subject. With NUMTOTs, that subject is wonky. Take \u201cNew Urbanism\u201d itself, a buzzy term for the 1990s movement promoting a return to dense, walkable design principles. In NUMTOT-land, the basic concept is all well and good, but the phrase\u2014which is now often applied to suburban housing developments\u2014is overused and clich\u00e9d. That makes New Urbanism, as well its foil in all things sprawling and car-related, ripe for irreverent commentary/shitposting. If you\u2019re still lost in the Rhetoric 300-level irony, take another actual meme, created by NUMTOT member Miles Blount. A comic book superhero with the face of Governor Andrew Cuomo is sweating over which red button to press\u2014\u201cFix the subways\u201d or \u201c$300 million light show.\u201d Plenty of New Yorkers would get the joke because they know which one Cuomo picked in real life. Memes have a way of making dry policy more accessible to average people, Orenstein said: \u201cThings about how the MTA is bad\u2014everyone can relate to that.\u201d Cities are changing fast. Keep up with the CityLab Daily newsletter. The best way to follow issues you care about. Subscribe Loading... That may help explain the appeal of the growing group. As more young people move into cities, they\u2019re curious about how cities work, succeed, and struggle, several members told me. Meanwhile, on university campuses, the number of city planning and GIS degree programs is also growing steadily. Young adults have more opportunities than before to get immersed in matters of bus ridership declines and contentious housing bills\u2014topics the TOTs pry open and endlessly litigate, through memes and regular rapid-fire comments, often splitting into various political factions. A fairly tame, semi-comprehensible snapshot: This week, someone posted a Twitter thread about housing statistics in the Bay Area, with this caption: \u201cIt feels great knowing I'll probably never be able to afford to move back to the area where I grew up.\u201d Another TOT replied: \u201csb 827 tho,\u201d referring to the ambitious California senate bill proposing to unlock housing development near transit. Elsewhere, Marxists, market urbanists, and YIMBYs were arguing every facet of SB 827\u2019s possible effects, civilly and otherwise. One member, Caleb Coggeshall, posted a trollish Spongebob Squarepants meme on the related topic of luxury housing that got 1,000 likes and 78 comments, mostly angry. \u201cBuild affordable housing with maximum income requirements, you rich diplord,\u201d said one dissenting leftist TOT. Conversation can devolve quickly. And like in so many internet forums, the moderators have dealt with legitimately troubling discourse, including eruptions of racism. Last fall, Eldred politely requested that members compensate moderators over Venmo for the \u201csheer amount of emotional labor\u201d required to fight the group\u2019s more inflammatory tendencies. (A few people obliged.) \u201cThere have been times where it\u2019s like we\u2019re being asked to moderate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a group about, you know, trains,\u201d Eldred said. She suspects the group won\u2019t last forever\u2014memes have a shelf life, after all. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s like we\u2019re asked to moderate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a group about, you know, trains,\u201d Eldred said. Still, at its best, NUMTOT is a place to get engaged with matters of profound importance to local communities, in language speckled with pop-culture references. \u201cThese are increasingly life and death issues for people I care about,\u201d said Jake Soiffer, a Bay Area community organizer who recently graduated from UC Berkeley and is a group member. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly really nice to have a place where people want to talk and argue and learn about them.\u201d\n\nBy many accounts, the benefits of the group outweigh its vexations. NUMTOT has created real-world action: Members have been inspired to take urban planning courses, apply for internships and jobs at city halls and DOTs, and organize local meetups to talk about the issues. Eldred has recruited folks to her local chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. Several NUMTOTs are running for elected offices, including Alfred Twu, an environmental designer in Berkeley gunning for a city council seat on a NUMTOT-approved affordable housing platform. Multiple members have hooked up romantically, and there has been at least one NUMTOT nuptial. (They\u2019re also breaking into real-world media\u2014Chicago magazine covered the group this week, too.) Historically, the worlds of planning and transit have had trouble attracting younger people to their ranks. NUMTOT proves that that doesn\u2019t have to be the case, Eldred said. If cities were staffed up with people who genuinely cared about the systems that make them tick\u2014people as passionate about real trains as meme trains\u2014surely they\u2019d be better places to live. \u201cLots of members have told me that they\u2019d never really cared about these issues until they found the group,\u201d Eldred said. \u201cNow, they\u2019re actually invested.\u201d", "description": "The 62,000 members of this urbanist Facebook group are doing more than just making weird memes.
