You need to play your game. You are here because you can play good football so you need to show everyone and not try to hide, just show your talent and we all tried to do that.\n\n\"I have never scored before for Liverpool in the U18s or the U23s so it's the first one for Liverpool and I'm really happy.\"\n\nHoever, 17, moved to Liverpool from Ajax last year and is hoping to be involved in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup as Klopp's side welcome Premier League rivals Arsenal to Anfield.\n\n\"You hope the manager starts you in the next game again and gives you minutes,\" he added.\n\n\"That's what you are hoping for - the next game.\"\n\nElliott hit the woodwork twice during the match but MK Dons created opportunities of their own as Jordan Bowery also saw a shot strike the post.\n\n\"I'm quite gutted really, I think we could have scored a few,\" said Dons defender Regan Poole.\n\n\"We didn't hold back, had a good go and a fair few chances and we should have scored a couple - that is the only regret really.\n\n\"We were always hoping to have a right go with nothing to lose and I think we showed that. In the second half I think we were really good.\n\n\"We need to take this confidence now into the league, kick on and get back to winning ways.\"\n\nPA", "description": "Ki-Jana Hoever believes the Carabao Cup presents the \"perfect way\" for Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp to blood his young players.
