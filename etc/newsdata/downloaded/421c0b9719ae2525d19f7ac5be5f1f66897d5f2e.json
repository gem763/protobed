And there's mixed news on the IPO front. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 17th September.\n\n1. The world waits for Saudi Arabia\n\nSaudi Arabia is due to update the world on how long it will take to and exports to their usual levels in the wake of the attacks on key energy infrastructure at the weekend.\n\nNational oil company Saudi Aramco is due to hold a press conference at 1:15 PM (1715 GMT), according to agency reports.\n\nOil prices have stabilized overnight, as the world digests the constructive ambiguity in Monday\u2019s statement by the Saudi authorities that stopped short of explicitly agreeing with the U.S. in blaming Iran directly for the attack. The lack of a common line makes an immediate armed response less likely, analysts say.\n\nBy 6 AM ET, the U.S. benchmark crude futures contract was at $61.59 a barrel, down 1.8% from late Thursday, while the international benchmark was down 1.5% at $67.97 a barrel.\n\n2. Fed meeting starts against backdrop of reduced hopes for rate cut\n\nIt\u2019s not usual for the Federal Reserve to be upstaged, but its two-day policy meeting will start later against the backdrop of fading hopes for an interest rate cut.\n\nA 25 basis-point cut in the target range for Fed funds had appeared a nailed-on certainty until last week, when the trade clouds started to lift and economic data showed the U.S. consumer was still alive and kicking.\n\nThe spike in oil prices has further muddied the waters, inasmuch as it will create some short-term inflationary pressure (and support economic activity from Texas to North Dakota through the oil and gas industry). According to Investing.com\u2019s , markets now see less than a two-thirds chance of a cut when the meeting winds up on Wednesday.\n\nData out later Tuesday on and , and on , will just be in time to have some input on the Fed\u2019s thinking.\n\n3. Stocks set for lower opening; Fedex earnings eyed\n\nWall Street is still in risk-off mode due to the spike in oil prices and accompanying geopolitical worries. However, major stock indices are indicated to open only modestly lower.\n\nBy 6 AM ET, were down 41 points or 0.2%, while the contract and the contract were also both down 0.2%.\n\nAfter the bell Tuesday, there will be earnings from Adobe (NASDAQ: ), newly-listed online petfood vendor Chewy (NYSE: ) and, most notably, bellwether stock FedEx (NYSE: ), the last of which is more directly exposed than most to the latest developments in oil prices.\n\n4. WeWork IPO delayed\n\nWeWork\u2019s parent company has reportedly shelved its prospective initial public offering under pressure from its largest shareholder Softbank. (T: ).\n\nSoftbank risks crystallizing a substantial loss if and when The We Company comes to market, having agreed to invest over $10 billion in the company so far, most of it at a much higher valuation that now seems achievable in public markets. Bloomberg reported that the targeted valuation may be as low as $15 billion when the deal finally comes \u2013 which may still be as early as next month.\n\nThere was more upbeat news on the IPO front from Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR: ), which is reportedly relaunching the IPO of its Asian business \u2013 a move that will help cut one of the world\u2019s biggest corporate debt loads. The Wall Street Journal reported that it\u2019s now looking to raise up to $4.84 billion via a deal that would value the Asian business at up to $50.7 billion.\n\n5. Apple (NASDAQ: ) launches appeal against EU tax bill\n\nApple\u2019s (NASDAQ: ) attempts to get the biggest tax bill in European history overturned reached the EU\u2019s top court on Tuesday.\n\nA final ruling on Apple\u2019s appeal from the European Court of Justice isn\u2019t expected for months, but will be worth waiting for, as it will set the tone for relations between the EU and the U.S.\u2019s tech giants for the next five years. Margrethe Vestager, the Danish politician who greatly expanded the scope of the EU\u2019s powerful antitrust watchdog with her forays into national tax policy, was re-nominated as antitrust commissioner for a new five-year term earlier this month.", "description": "Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Tuesday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPED4G0W4_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
