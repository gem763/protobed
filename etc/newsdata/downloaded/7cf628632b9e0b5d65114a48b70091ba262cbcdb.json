Here's What to Know About the Police Shooting", "language": "en", "text": "The shooting of a 28-year-old black woman in her own home by a white police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, has sparked protests over the Fort Worth Police Department\u2019s treatment of city\u2019s residents of color\u2014and raised questions about whether local police can be trusted to investigate their own.\n\nOn Monday, Fort Worth Police Chief Ed Kraus identified Aaron Dean as the officer who shot Atatiana Jefferson, 28, at her home early on Oct. 12. Dean resigned from the department on after being placed on administrative leave, and was later arrested on Monday.\n\nThe Fort Worth Police Department said authorities are investigating the shooting, but Jefferson\u2019s family has called for an outside investigation\u2014and for Dean to be prosecuted.\n\nDean was arrested and booked in jail for murder charges on Monday, according to the Associated Press. The attorney for the family, S. Lee Merritt, tweeted that the family is relieved about the arrest but said the city has a lot of work to do moving forward\u201d\n\nThe family of Atatiana Jefferson is relieved that Aaron Dean has been arrested & charged with murder.

(@MeritLaw) October 15, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about the Fort Worth shooting, and how a call to a non-emergency number led to the death of a 28-year-old woman.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nAt 2:23 a.m. on Oct. 12, Fort Worth resident James Smith called a non-emergency number, 311, to ask for a wellness check at his neighbors\u2019 home. Smith told the operator that the neighbors\u2019 front doors were open and all their lights were on, which was unusual for that time of night. He added that both the neighbors\u2019 cars were in the house\u2019s driveway, according to audio of the call.\n\nTwo police officers, including Dean, arrived two minutes later at the home, where Jefferson lived, police said. Body camera footage from the scene shows that Dean passed by the open door without knocking or calling out to the owners, and walked around the side of the house with a flashlight. Dean paused at a rear window, then shouted \u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d He then almost immediately fired a shot through the window, striking Jefferson. Police attempted to provide Jefferson with CPR, but she died on the scene, police said.\n\nJefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew, who police said was in the bedroom with Jefferson at the time of the shooting.\n\nPolice released an image of a gun inside the bedroom. Kraus, the Fort Worth police chief, said the gun was \u201cjust inside the window\u201d but declined to comment on whether Jefferson was holding the gun.\n\nWho was Atatiana Koquice Jefferson?\n\nThe family of Atatiana \u201cTay\u201d Jefferson will be hosting a press conference addressing the murder of Atatiana by Fort Worth PD today at 11AM at the Merritt Law Firm office located at 1910 Pacific Ave 8th floor Dallas TX 75201.
