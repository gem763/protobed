House of Commons Speaker John Bercow could refuse to allow such a vote because parliamentary rules generally bar the same measure from being considered a second time during the same session of Parliament unless something has changed.\n\nBercow says the vote sought by the government was \u201cin substance the same\u201d as one held on Saturday and it would be \u201crepetitive and disorderly\u201d to allow a new vote Monday.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservative government will now go to its Plan B: get Parliament\u2019s backing for the deal by passing the legislation necessary to implement it. The government plans to publish the bill later Monday and hopes to have it become law by Britain\u2019s scheduled Oct. 31 departure date.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear whether the bill can win majority backing in Parliament, and opposition lawmakers will try to seek amendments that could alter or scuttle it.\n\nBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay urged lawmakers to back the bill and \u2014 more than three years after British voters narrowly voted to leave the EU \u2014 \u201cenable us to move onto the people\u2019s priorities like health, education and crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the chance to leave the EU with a deal on Oct. 31,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Parliament wants to respect the referendum, it must back the bill.\u201d\n\nWith the Brexit deadline looming and British politicians still squabbling over the country\u2019s departure terms, Johnson has been forced to ask the EU for a three-month delay to Britain\u2019s departure date.\n\nHe did that, grudgingly, to comply with a law passed by Parliament ordering the government to postpone Brexit rather than risk the economic damage that could come from a no-deal exit. But Johnson accompanied the unsigned letter to the EU late Saturday with a second note saying that he personally opposed delaying the U.K.\u2019s Oct. 31 exit.\n\nPro-EU activists, who took the government to court in Scotland to ensure that it complied with the law, said the second letter might amount to an attempt to frustrate the legislation. Scotland\u2019s highest court said Monday it would keep the case open, retaining the power to censure Johnson\u2019s government until its obligations under the law have been complied with \u201cin full.\u201d\n\nThe claimants\u2019 lawyer, Elaine Motion, said the ruling meant \u201cthe sword of Damocles remains hanging\u201d over the government.\n\nThe bloc said the fact Johnson had not signed the letter was irrelevant.\n\nEuropean Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said Monday that European Council President Donald Tusk had acknowledged receiving the Brexit extension request and was now talking with the EU\u2019s other 27 leaders about it.\n\nThose 27 EU leaders are weary of the long-running Brexit saga but also want to avoid a no-deal British exit, which would damage economies on both sides of the Channel.\n\nGermany\u2019s economy minister suggested it could be a few days before the EU decided to respond to the Brexit delay request.\n\n\u201cWe will have somewhat more clarity in the coming days, and we will then exercise our responsibility and quickly make a decision,\u201d Germany\u2019s Peter Altmaier said.\n\nHe told Deutschlandfunk radio that he wouldn\u2019t have a problem with an extension by \u201ca few days or a few weeks\u201d if that rules out a no-deal Brexit.\n\nBut French President Emmanuel Macron, who had a phone call with Johnson over the weekend, called for a quick clarification of the U.K.\u2019s position. In a statement, he said a delay \u201cwould not be in any party\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s junior minister for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, told French news broadcaster BFM TV there would have to be some reason for the delay, such as a parliamentary election in Britain or a new British referendum on Brexit.\n\nThe British government still hopes it can pass the needed Brexit legislation by the end of the month so the U.K. can leave on time.\n\nBut it suffered a setback on Saturday \u2014 Parliament\u2019s first weekend sitting since the 1982 Falklands War \u2014 when British lawmakers voted to make support for the Brexit deal conditional on passing the legislation to implement it, something that could take several days or weeks.\n\nThat also gives British lawmakers another chance to scrutinize \u2014 and possibly change\u2014 the Brexit departure terms while the bill is still in Parliament.\n\n___\n\nGeir Moulson in Berlin, Lorne Cook in Brussels and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this AP story.", "description": "Johnson\u2019s plan to deliver Brexit at the end of this month hit another roadblock when the speaker rejected his attempt to hold a new vote.", "authors": ["Breitbart London"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/John-Bercow-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
