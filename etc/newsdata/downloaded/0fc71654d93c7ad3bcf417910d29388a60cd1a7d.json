People are expending less energy, becoming more sedentary and adopting a Western-style diet that's high in sugar, oil, starch and fat,\" Dr Tim Lobstein, director of policy at the WOF and one of the authors of the the report, told CNN.\n\nThe report said that no country included in the atlas would meet a target agreed to at a World Health Organization summit in 2013, which mandated that levels of childhood obesity should be no higher in 2025 than they were between 2010 and 2012. It added that four out of five countries it assessed had a less than 10% chance of doing so.\n\nRead More", "description": "More than 250 million school-aged children and adolescents will be classed as obese by 2030, putting huge pressure on healthcare systems, a new report on childhood obesity warns.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190305090441-child-obesity-rates-china-stock-super-tease.jpg"}
