Though Goulard is a former MEP with extensive policy experience, she will likely face scrutiny over alleged misuse of EU funds by her party during her time in the European Parliament.\n\n\"She is a woman with long-standing European experience, and an intimate knowledge of European institutions, and perfectly shares the president's vision having been one of his earliest supporters,\" said Sibeth Ndiaye, French government spokesperson, on Wednesday. Goulard \"has a personal relationship with Ursula von der Leyen,\" she added.\n\nThe two met at least once in Berlin when they were both defense ministers in May 2017.\n\nCurrently deputy governor at the French central bank, Goulard is known for her expertise in economics and European affairs.\n\nA former adviser to Romano Prodi, the ex-Commission president, Goulard was an MEP for the liberal ALDE group from 2009 to 2017 and served as a rapporteur on many high-profile economic files, including eurozone governance. She is one of the most ardent promoters of Franco-German ties and one the few French politicians who can speak German and Italian fluently.\n\nIn 2017, Macron appointed her defense minister, but she resigned a month later, following a legal investigation into whether she used assistants inappropriately during her time as an MEP. She has not yet been cleared of these suspicions, and many officials believe these could complicate her nomination hearings in the European Parliament in October.\n\nIf Goulard secures the support of Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen and the European Parliament, she will replace Pierre Moscovici \u2014 the current European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, taxation and customs \u2014 as the French commissioner.\n\nMacron indicated to von der Leyen France\u2019s interest in either a climate and energy portfolio or an economic one when they met in Paris at the end of July.\n\n\"I can confirm that we are aiming to get an economic portfolio,\" a senior French diplomatic official said Wednesday.\n\nAn official in President Macron\u2019s office gave hints last week about the possible contours of the portfolio: \u201cEconomic reform, industrial policy and competition policy have meaning in terms of the agenda.\u201d\n\nThe final decision on portfolios rests with von der Leyen, and is expected to be announced on September 15, the French official said.\n\nAfter they opened an investigation in France in 2017, French judges asked the European Parliament to provide information on suspicious contracts inside the centrist MoDem party. The case revolved around whether Goulard and other MEPs employed assistants at the European Parliament who were actually carrying out work for their party in France.\n\nEuropean Parliament officials say the information was provided and the legal case is now in the hands of French judges.\n\nA spokesperson for the Parliament said Goulard\u2019s case in the EU chamber was \u201cclosed\u201d as Goulard \u201cpaid back\u201d what she owed for what the spokesperson described as \u201cadministrative errors which were not intentional and not systemic.\u201d Those errors, the spokesperson specified, involved \u201cincorrectly notifying changes of posting for assistants.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Parliament has only administrative powers in this case, and the fact that Goulard reimbursed the money she owed does not affect France\u2019s current legal investigation over her ex-MoDem party.\n\n\"We are talking about a case where there hasn\u2019t been any developments for more than two years\" said Pieyre-Alexandre Anglade, an MP from Macron's party and former spokesperson of the party's Renaissance list for the European Parliament election.\n\n\"The case has been ongoing in France for two years but judges haven't asked to hear her,\" the senior diplomatic official said, taking it as a positive sign.\n\nGoulard\u2019s work consulting for a U.S. think tank while she was a MEP also raised eyebrows.\n\nSome French politicians have already attacked Macron for his choice.\n\n\u201cVery embarrassing! What prevented her from being minister in France is negligible on the European level,\u201d tweeted French Green MEP Yannick Jadot.\n\nBut the senior diplomatic official contested that take.\n\n\"Nothing prevented her from being minister,\" the senior diplomatic official said. \"She resigned when that case came up to protect the project of the president.\"\n\nGoulard had been a lead contender for the position for weeks but France\u2019s announcement was delayed after Macron requested an extension from von der Leyen.\n\nThe president-elect is currently interviewing nominees put forward by EU countries, with a decision expected on portfolios next week.\n\nThis article was updated.", "description": "Goulard is a former minister and MEP from the liberal ALDE group.", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Lili Bayer", "Stephen Brown", "Ivo Oliveira"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-691168916-1-1200x628.jpg"}
