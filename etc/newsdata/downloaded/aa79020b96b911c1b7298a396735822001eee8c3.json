For the past few days, Trump has demanded that House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff be \u201cquestioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason\u201d for a mocking paraphrase of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky using mafia-like language.\n\nThe accusation of treason is absurd. The Constitution specifically protects the remarks of legislators on the House floor, secures freedom of speech, and defines treason in extremely narrow terms, limiting it to \u201clevying war\u201d against the U.S. or aiding its enemies. But Trump makes no distinction between loyalty to him as a person and loyalty to the United States, and so takes criticism as treason.\n\nYet despite the president\u2019s bluster, nothing happened. The Justice Department did not arrest and imprison Schiff, arraigning him on charges of treason. And that reality speaks to both the absurdity and danger of this moment, in which American democracy relies on the willingness of executive-branch subordinates to ignore the ravings of the Mad King. This extends into the realm of policy, where Trump\u2019s own officials have struggled to contain his lust for cruelty, refusing requests to gun down migrants or install a moat with alligators at the border.\n\nElected Republicans know that Trump is unfit for office. The president\u2019s own subordinates know that Trump is unfit for office. They know this, because when the president issues ridiculous orders, such as the demand that a leader of the opposition party be arrested, they ignore his demands. A nation in which the opposition cannot criticize the head of state without facing criminal sanction is not a democracy, but it is the kind of country over which Donald Trump would like to preside. The result is that American democracy rests on the willingness of bureaucrats to ignore the commands of their democratically elected chief executive.\n\nUnable to defend the substance of the president\u2019s extortion attempt, Republicans have turned to complaining about the process. But Thursday\u2019s performance on the White House lawn renders those baseless complaints moot\u2014the president just did publicly what the Democrats have accused him of doing privately. The only argument against removing Trump from office is that Trump\u2019s raving is just Trump being Trump, and is not to be taken seriously. But the fact that the president\u2019s madness must be ignored from time to time for America to continue to function as a democracy is an argument for, not against, his removal.\n\nAlthough congressional Democrats and Republicans are divided on impeachment, there is vanishingly little disagreement on whether or not Trump abuses his authority or is fit to be president. The distinction is that, for the moment, Republicans appear not to care.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
