Donald and Melania Trump pose with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and wife Olena Zelenskaya ahead of a dinner on Tuesday night\n\nAnd this is no longer ambiguous Washington rumor, it\u2019s cold hard fact confirmed in Donald Trump\u2019s own words, released in an official document from the White House.\n\nAny impartial non-partisan observer who reads that transcript would conclude it\u2019s at very least, highly inappropriate.\n\nI certainly did.\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s absolutely shocking to me that President Trump would be so reckless so soon after the Mueller probe ended.\n\nHe must have known it would become public, and spark the very firestorm that is now erupting over it.\n\nA transcript of the President Trump's July conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart was released on Wednesday (above), the day after Nancy Pelosi announced formal impeachment hearings would take place\n\nBUT, and it\u2019s a very significant \u2018but\u2019, it wasn\u2019t a crime.\n\nAt least, that was the clear determination of the Justice Department when its high-powered legal brains carefully studied the transcript after it was referred to them following a complaint by a mystery whistle-blower.\n\nThey concluded unequivocally that there was no criminal case to answer.\n\nAnd the main reason for that, I suspect, is that it failed to establish the main charge \u2013 namely, that President Trump deliberately withdrew substantial aid to Ukraine unless they did his bidding on the investigation into Joe Biden.\n\nSo there was no \u2018quid pro quo\u2019, which would almost certainly have taken the conversation into very perilous legal waters.\n\nTrump asked the leader of Ukraine to investigate what he claims is possible - though vehemently denied - corruption in that country involving Biden\u2019s son Hunter (pictured together above)\n\nYes, Trump is heard saying \u2018I\u2019d like you to do us a favor\u2019, and yes, he had withheld the aid just days before the call.\n\nBut there is no damning irrefutable connection proven between these two things in what has so far been published \u2013 no \u2018smoking gun\u2019.\n\nAnd without it, we\u2019re left with Trump asking the leader of Ukraine to investigate what he claims is possible - though vehemently denied - corruption in that country involving Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nMany will think this is a not entirely unreasonable request given that Biden Snr was Vice-President at the time his son was being paid $50,000 a month to advise a dodgy Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings, without, say his critics, any proper experience to do so.\n\nFormer Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich - who was ousted from power after mass protests - had close ties with a 'dodgy' gas company on whose board Hunter Biden sat\n\nAs Vice-President, Joe Biden led US diplomatic efforts to protect Ukraine\u2019s fledgling democracy and root out corruption after mass protests ousted former President Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nBurisma, on whose board Hunter Biden sat, had links to Yanukovych that prompted corruption probes and caused the Obama White House to panic about a potentially damaging conflict of interest.\n\nNo such conflict has ever been proven, but the stench of suspicion surrounding Hunter Biden\u2019s activities in Ukraine remains and seems a legitimate issue of concern if his father wants to be President. The bottom line is this: Hunter was only valuable to Burisma because his dad was Vice-President, so what did he do for them?\n\nThe transcript reveals that Trump also asked President Zelensky to look into whether he could find Hillary Clinton\u2019s infamous missing email server, which he said he\u2019d been told might have ended up in Ukraine.\n\nAgain, many, particularly among Trump\u2019s base, will think that\u2019s not an outrageous request given how central it was to a criminal investigation that may have affected the 2016 Election.\n\nThe transcript also reveals that Trump also asked President Zelensky to look into whether he could find Hillary Clinton\u2019s infamous missing email server, which he said he\u2019d been told might have ended up in Ukraine\n\nYet outraged Democrats think all this is deadly serious presidential misconduct, have decided to risk dying on this Ukraine hill, and are now moving to impeach the President.\n\nAnd by doing so, I think they\u2019re making a terrible political mistake that may well cause them to end up.. dying on this hill.\n\nImpeachment is a very rare thing in America.\n\nOnly three Presidents have ever been impeached \u2013 Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon.\n\nNone of them was convicted though Nixon would have been had he not resigned.\n\nOnly three Presidents have ever been impeached \u2013 Andrew Johnson, top left, Bill Clinton, top right, and Richard Nixon, above. None of them was convicted though Nixon would have been had he not resigned.\n\nTo be successful, an impeachment process must pass through the House of Representatives and then go to trial in the Senate.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the big problem for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her fellow Democrats.\n\nThey\u2019ll almost certainly get Trump\u2019s impeachment through the House where they hold a majority. In fact, the votes are already almost there.\n\nBut as things stand, they don\u2019t have a cat in hell\u2019s chance of getting Trump convicted in the Senate, where 67 of 100 votes are needed to succeed and there are currently 53 Republican Senators.\n\nSo unless some new dynamite piece of information emerges during the investigations then this bid will inevitably fail, and everyone knows it.\n\nAnd everyone also knows how gleefully Trump likes to seize on failure and mock \u2018losers\u2019.\n\nHe shamelessly used the Mueller Report to go on a seemingly never-ending one-man ticker tape parade, branding the media who obsessed about it \u2018fake news\u2019 and his political opponents a bunch of useless wastrels who got their come-uppance for lying about him.\n\nJust imagine what Trump would do with an impeachment acquittal in the run-up to November, 2020?!\n\nSo why in hell have the Democrats done this?\n\nWell, I believe it\u2019s what NFL fans call a \u2018Hail Mary Pass\u2019, one made in desperation with the knowledge that it has very little chance of success.\n\nThe quarterback, Ms Pelosi, has hurled the impeachment ball into the air after intense pressure from her own side, and is hoping it somehow lands in the end zone with enough mud to sink Trump\u2019s re-election chances.\n\nShe\u2019s done it, after repeatedly saying she wouldn\u2019t, because Pelosi is a smart long-serving Washington cookie that has read the election tealeaves and reached the sobering conclusion Trump\u2019s increasingly likely to win re-election.\n\nThe US economy\u2019s doing well, certainly by comparison to most other countries, and when sitting presidents run for re-election on the back of a strong economy, they invariably win again.\n\nTo be successful, an impeachment process must pass through the House of Representatives and then go to trial in the Senate. And there\u2019s the big problem for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, above, and her fellow Democrats.\n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of who could beat him anyway?\n\nThe Democrat presidential candidate field looks increasingly lackluster, and I don\u2019t think Trump fears any of them with the possible exception of Biden who despite his age remains a canny operator.\n\nYet the irony of this impeachment development is that it may end up doing more harm to Biden than Trump.\n\nThere are, as I said, very genuine questions to be asked as to exactly what Hunter Biden was doing in Ukraine for his $50,000 a month, while his father held one the second highest office in America.\n\nWhat did he promise them when he joined?\n\nWhat influence did he wield?\n\nDid his father intervene to prevent his son being investigated?\n\nBiden Snr says they never discussed it, which seems highly implausible, not least because Biden Jr said they did at least once.\n\nWhatever the truth, it will all come out in these impeachment investigations, and if the Bidens aren\u2019t being entirely straight then it could be Joe who is politically scalped, not Trump.\n\nSo, I find this impeachment move inexplicable.\n\n\u2018It turned out to be a nothing call,\u2019 Trump said today.\n\nNo, it didn\u2019t Mr President.\n\nIt was a very dumb call to have made.\n\nBut nowhere as dumb as the Democrats\u2019 call to try to impeach you over it.\n\nTHAT call may cost them the election next year.", "description": "It's shocking that Trump would be so reckless so soon after the Mueller probe.
