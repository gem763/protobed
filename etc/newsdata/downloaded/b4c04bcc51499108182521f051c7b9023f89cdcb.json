He was of an older generation and he wanted people to wear pink to his funeral and have a laugh and a joke. It shows the industry is already changing.\n\nThey spent two weeks decorating the hearse themselves (Picture: David McHugh/ Brighton Pictures)\n\n\u2018I ended up doing most of his service and afterwards the funeral directors said they\u2019d never experienced anything like it. We made it really fun, inclusive and celebratory.\n\n\u2018It just stayed in the back of my mind. I found myself thinking, well why aren\u2019t they?\u2019\n\nGersch, who also runs an events company, added: \u2018We\u2019re a bespoke, creative funeral service that aims to deliver the wishes of people who think outside the box, excuse the pun.\n\n'Several injured' and teenager arrested after stabbing at McDonald's\n\n\u2018We can make a funeral hit headlines or bring a town to standstill. No one wants to be forgotten, so why not add to your legacy and keep the party going!\u2019\n\nGersch and Matty first met while working as researchers for Celebrity Juice in 2016, describing their friendship as \u2018love at first sight\u2019.\n\nThey quickly formed a double act, planning shows and YouTube videos together \u2013 while dedicating a lot of their time to covering cars in flowers.\n\nThe pair then decided to buy a hearse earlier this year, after originally raising money for a limousine.\n\nThe pair are striving to make a positive change in the funeral industry (Picture: David McHugh/ Brighton Pictures)\n\nThere are 20,000 flowers stuck to the car (Picture: David McHugh/ Brighton Pictures)\n\nIt took them two weeks to transform the vehicle, with each flower stuck on individually using cement glue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlower Power Funerals completed their first funeral in August for a woman in Hove \u2013 to huge success.\n\nMatty said: \u2018I was driving from the church to the crematorium, and the daughter, she thought the hearse was so wonderful, she ended up sitting in the back with her mum\u2019s coffin.\n\nWoman found ham on her veggie Domino's after switching on the big light\n\n\u2018She was going crazy because we brought Hove to a standstill! People were stopping and taking photos. She kept saying: \u201cMy mum would love to see this right now!\u201d She was super happy.\u2019\n\nThe company\u2019s services extend from basic hearse hire, to full-out funeral planning \u2013 with Gersch emphasising that no idea is \u2018too outrageous\u2019 for them to take on.\n\nHe said: \u2018Maybe the deceased loved skydiving and wanted to be parachuted into the ground.\n\n\u2018Maybe they were a deep sea diver and would love for it all to be all underwater. You see weddings underwater, so why not funerals?\n\nThey bought the hearse earlier this year (Picture: David McHugh/ Brighton Pictures)\n\nIt\u2019s now been completely transformed (Picture: David McHugh/ Brighton Pictures)\n\n\u2018We will shoot you into space, we will mummify you like the Egyptian gods, we can have DJs, we can put on a clown party. Any idea you have, we will try our absolute best to make it happen.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018Funerals should be personal. We want to ask families, what was he or she like? What would they want?\n\n\u2018I would want to leave the best party ever in remembrance of me, where guests are welcome to have a song and a dance with David Gersch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019d be like, he\u2019s enjoying this too. He\u2019s over in the corner dancing. His soul lives on and it\u2019s all around us. It\u2019d be a celebration of life.\u2019\n\nYou can find Flower Power Funerals here.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
