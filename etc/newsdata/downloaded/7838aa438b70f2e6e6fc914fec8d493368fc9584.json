A settlement at that level would be the highest for a most-active contract since it ended at $9.31 \u00bd on July 12 of this year, according to FactSet data.\n\nMeanwhile, corn futures fell by nearly 3% even as the USDA said corn production is forecast at 13.779 billion bushels, down 20 million bushels from the previous forecast.\n\nThe report pegged expected yield per harvested acre at 168.4 bushels, up slightly from the 168.2 bushels September report estimate.\n\n\u201cThe trade expected even lower numbers [on corn production] and few expected the USDA to raise the corn yield, no matter how slightly,\u201d said Gilbertie.\n\nDecember corn CZ19, -3.68% was down 12 1/2 cents, or 3.2%, at $3.81 \u00be a bushel.\n\nRounding out action in grain futures, December wheat WZ19, -1.90% traded at $4.90 1/4 a bushel, down 10 cents, or 2%.\n\nThe USDA reduced its wheat production estimate for the 2019/2020 marketing year to 1,962 million bushels, down 18.5 million bushels.", "description": "Soybean prices climbed Thursday, heading for the highest settlement in nearly three months as a monthly report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed...", "authors": ["Myra P.
