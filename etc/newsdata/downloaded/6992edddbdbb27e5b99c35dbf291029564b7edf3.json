Q3 production was down 3% compared to the same period last year.\n\nProduction was hit by lower ore grades at Mponeng, a planned reduction in output at the Cerro Vanguardia mine in Argentina and a planned reduction in open-pit mining at Kibali in Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nGold production at Mponeng rose 4.8% from last quarter while production at the Geita jumped 15%, and the Kibali mine - a joint venture with Barrick Gold - saw a 3.2% drop in production.\n\n(Reporting by Helen Reid; Editing by Aditya Soni and Richard Pullin)", "description": "AngloGold Ashanti on Monday reported a 3% rise in September quarter production from the previous quarter and a 12% jump in free cash flow thanks to higher gold prices, and said its Obuasi project in Ghana would start by year-end.
