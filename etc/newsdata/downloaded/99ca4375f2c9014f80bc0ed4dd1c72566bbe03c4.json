So, he\u2019ll 100 per cent be there.'\n\nThe star detailed the advice the Knight Rider star had given her ahead of the show, saying: \u2018Just to sing my heart out and stay true to who I am. It\u2019s the same advice that he\u2019s told me since the day that I got into this industry.'\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been taught since I was younger that it\u2019s all about your team, your family, yourself and who you are. So, it doesn\u2019t really matter what people say.\n\nCandid: She said: \u2018My family is so important to me, and I think sometimes having to speak about your family before you do something so vulnerable where you\u2019re trying to prove your own self can be a bit shaky' (pictured with sister Taylor Ann and David in 2017)\n\n'Especially in this day and age it\u2019s more about our personal growth and what we can convey out there through our message and music, and hopefully people can jump on board.'\n\nThe star said going out of her comfort zone to sing on The X Factor was a 'beautiful experience.'\n\nShe said: \u2018I\u2019m so confident in everything else that I do but music is the one place that I feel vulnerable. And so it did bring up all these different emotions getting on stage to do something where I felt a bit naked.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s scary. Especially when you know you\u2019re so confident in other areas and then you put yourself in that position. It\u2019s also a beautiful experience to be able to connect back to who you are a figure out those different pieces.\n\n\u2018I was a teenager then and I\u2019m an adult now. It\u2019s a very different world.\u2019\n\nProud: Hayley also revealed that proud dad David will be there to support her during the live shows, saying: 'My dad\u2019s seen me on stage so many times with my sister, and he\u2019s so excited for me to be back on stage on my own. So, he\u2019ll 100 per cent be there' (pictured 2017)\n\nHayley added that it was 'nerve-wracking' to watch the first episode, saying: 'It was an interesting experience. And I\u2019m totally out of my comfort zone. It is what it is. You train and you do the best that you can, and you do your best in the moment.\u2019\n\n\u2018I have hardly any singing background. I obviously sang with my father bits and pieces growing up and had a brief band with sister. I\u2019d say we were pop stars for a summer and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t been on stage since 2011. I\u2019ve been focusing on acting and fashion and to get back into music was a really big thing for me.'\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t regret the song that I did. I just put so much pressure on myself to do so well. I was also travelling a tonne before the show, and I think by the time I got onto the stage I just felt that my nerves may have taken the best of me a little bit.\n\n\u2018But hey it\u2019s all fun and games. And, I\u2019m just so excited to start my journey again with music. Just being able to work again in that arena is great.\u2019\n\nSongstress: Hayley added that it was 'nerve-wracking' to watch the first episode, saying: 'It was an interesting experience. And I\u2019m totally out of my comfort zone. It is what it is'\n\nThe celebrity line up is Megan McKenna, 27, The Islanders - made up of Love Island 2018 contestants Wes Nelson, 21, Zara McDermott, 22, Samira Mighty and Eyal Booker, 24, Ricki Lake, 51, Try Star - made up of rugby players Thom Evans, 34, Levi Davis, 21, Ben Foden, 34, The Chase star Jenny Ryan, 37, Cole & Edwards - made up of Strictly star - Brendan Cole, 43 and actor Jeremy Edwards, 48, Glee star Kevin McHale, 31.\n\nOnly recently, in an interview ahead of the launch, Simon revealed the reason why he decided to revamp the normal show into a celebrity version.\n\n'It just felt so obvious to do a celebrity version', he explained. 'The only condition was I couldn\u2019t know who was going to be on it. I said to the team, \"You\u2019ve got to find some acts who you believe can sell records off the back of this, because if you don\u2019t do that it won\u2019t work.\"\n\n'So that was the deal and we stuck to it. I swear to God I didn\u2019t have a clue who any of the acts were. I did walk away thinking, \u201cIf we\u2019re smart, we have artists here who could actually sell records off the back of this\u201d. So I thought that was fun and very exciting for the show.'\n\nThe music boss also shared how he felt about holding the auditions in his own back garden.\n\nHe said: 'When we filmed it that night it didn\u2019t feel like work. I loved every second of it. I said to the producers, \u201cIf this really doesn\u2019t work, we will have to re-audition for the show. That\u2019s the deal.\u201d\n\n'So the fact that I felt we didn\u2019t need to was just great. I found it interesting and fun, and doing this version of the show has also given me the chance to do All Stars. I\u2019ve wanted to make the best of the best version of The X Factor for a long, long time. It\u2019s been brilliant. I\u2019ve loved every minute.'\n\nThis series, like the civilian version, will see the acts split into three groups; the overs, the unders and the groups.\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity starts Saturday 12th October 8:35pm on ITV.", "description": "Hayley Hasselhoff discussed emerging from her famous father's shadow as she prepares for her  debut on The X Factor: Celebrity on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Ellie Phillips", "Eve Buckland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/12/19536836-0-image-a-65_1570707689518.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
