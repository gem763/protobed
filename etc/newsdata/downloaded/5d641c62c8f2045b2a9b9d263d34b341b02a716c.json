On the site, which has a 2.4 million user base, Tether currently accounts for 30% of volume, which is 30 times more than a year ago.\n\nTether undermines Ether\u2019s leadership?\n\nBitcoin application as a means of payment has seen a nearly 60% drop in volume from 80% last year, according to CoinPayments, while Tether has pushed Ether out of second place. Users purportedly choose Tether due to the stablecoin\u2019s capability to avoid price fluctuations. Sean Mackay, operations lead at CoinPayments.net, said:\n\n\u201cMerchants used to accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and convert it into Tether in order to hedge against the volatility. Now we are seeing the payments just being done directly in Tether.\u201d\n\nAlso, Tether has seen wider adoption among the types of merchants who have difficulty getting credit-card processing services or who are forced to pay high card processing fees.\n\nMultimillion token mint and new offerings\n\nIn mid-September, Tether minted 300 million USDT as part of the swap from the Omni protocol to the Ethereum blockchain. However, no token burn on the Omni blockchain had taken place at the time. In July, Tether accidentally minted and subsequently burned 5 billion USDT tokens.\n\nAlso last month, Tether announced the launch of a new stablecoin tied to the offshore Chinese yuan dubbed CNHT. The new currency joins Tether\u2019s other stablecoins backed by U.S. dollars (USDT) and euro (EURT).\n\nAs part of its further offerings expansion, Tether plans to release a version of the stablecoin backed by a basket of commodities such as gold, crude oil and rubber.", "description": "Stablecoin Tether (USDT) has gained popularity as a payment method, catching up with Bitcoin and Ether according to a Bloomberg report", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYjI3ZGZhYTZiMjkzNzg5ZDUyZDkyMzA5MTA3OGZlZDQuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
