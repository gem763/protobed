He\u2019s a superstar. Arcadia Queen is racing in it, too, so, it\u2019s going to be some race.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re racing for a $7.5 million race in Sydney on Derby Day (in Melbourne). It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nBoss assessed both Kolding and Brutal ahead of the race.\n\nThis is a set weights event, so both will carry 57.5kg, while the mares get in with 55.5kg, so both will need to run even better than they did in the big handicaps they won with less weight.\n\n\u201cKolding got a lovely run in the Epsom,\u201d Boss said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t go that fast, he got into the right spot and we were able to win.\n\n\u201cOnly time will tell if he is a miler or isn\u2019t because we see them winning those races with light weight then not being milers.\n\n\u201cBrutal is probably more of a sprinting miler than a miler but he had 49.5kg on his back when he won the Doncaster.\u201d", "description": "As Epsom and Doncaster winners this year, Kolding and Brutal have arguably the best credentials leading into Saturday\u2019s $7.5 million Golden Eagle (1500m) at Rosehill and Glen Boss can line them up better than most.", "authors": ["Matt Jones"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/13272a4d1cc284feacc42d5bbc4cd9b8?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
