Otherwise, if you\u2019re less concerned, just copy and paste your text to Word or even Grammarly, if you want to look out for any misspellings or punctuation issues, too.\n\nBetter yet, and by recommendation of Lifehacker staff writer Nick, give Typio Form Recovery a try; it\u2019s a Chrome Extension, and when enabled, it will save any answers you complete within an online survey or form. When you lose your text, just click on Typio\u2019s icon.
