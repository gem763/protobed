Just the thought of them awakens the Ron (from Harry Potter) in me, makes me want to tear out of my skin and run towards hell as long as it does not have spiders. So, you would understand why a video of a man picking up hundreds of spiders - wrongfully assuming the cluster to be a big fur ball - freaked the living daylights out of me.\n\nThe video, which is now going viral, shows a Texas man approaching a massive black fur ball that seemed to have gathered in the corner of a wall.\n\nThe fur ball seems fluffy until it is in his hands and it starts to disintegrate.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt becomes increasingly clear with every passing moment of horror, that what the man has in his hands is hundreds of spiders that are scurrying away from his hand. The man seems unperturbed and brings the spiders closer to the camera, to let whoever is seeing the video know that those are indeed spiders.\n\nPeople obviously freaked out after looking at the horrifying clip. While some claimed they screamed after watching the video, some said it made their skin crawl.\n\nDon't Miss 199 SHARES 128 SHARES 152 SHARES\n\nWell, forget spider man, a spider king seems to be in town.
