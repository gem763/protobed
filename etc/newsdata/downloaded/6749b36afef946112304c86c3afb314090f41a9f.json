I have nothing interesting to say Jane Birkin\n\nToday she has released the second volume of her memoirs, covering life after Gainsbourg. In this weighty 432-page book called Post-scriptum, Birkin reveals that she never completely got over him. When they split in 1980, she writes that he told her: \u201cYou are on your way down, I am on my way up.\u201d But when he died aged 62 in May 1991 of a heart attack, \u201cmy world was left in chaos, silence and darkness. Serge is dead. Impossible... everything seems fuzzy but with the precision of a nightmare.\u201d Four days later, Birkin\u2019s father died; in less than a week she had lost the two most important men in her life, two men who, she says, had loved her \u201cunconditionally\u201d.\n\nIn the book, Birkin\u2019s emotions run the gamut from extremes: insecure and unhappy one day, overjoyed and passionate the next, via hysterical tantrums, outbursts, tears and depression. She also displays a remarkable talent for mocking herself, recalling how, when invited to take a role in a theatre production of a play by the 17th-century French writer Marivaux, she thought she was in a play by Marie Vau.\n\nWhat Birkin, riddled with insecurities and convinced she was \u201csuffering from mediocrity and no personality\u201d, wanted above all was to be loved.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m nothing, I\u2019m persecuted by women who I love more than myself... Oh for the face of Nastassja Kinski, of Fanny Ardant, oh, the talent, the courage, the qualities. I have nothing interesting to say...\u201d Birkin writes.\n\nShe also writes of her troubled relationship with her daughters: photographer Kate Barry \u2013 from Birkin\u2019s marriage to the Bond film composer John Barry \u2013 who died in 2013 after falling from her fourth-floor Paris apartment; actress Charlotte Gainsbourg; and model Lou Doillon, the result of her relationship with the French film director Jacques Doillon.\n\nBirkin recalls how, as a teenager, the increasingly troubled Kate skipped school, stayed out late at Paris nightclubs, took drugs and stole her clothes. She recounts how she ended up screaming \u201cthief, thief\u201d like a madwoman after Kate \u201cborrowed\u201d a purple Yves Saint Laurent jacket from her wardrobe. \u201cI thought they\u2019d send me to an asylum,\u201d she writes.\n\nDaughter Charlotte once said she wanted to be \u201can actress like my mother and a drunk like my father\u201d, but Birkin admits she was no stranger to alcohol. \u201cI drank quite a lot... reading back [the diary] it\u2019s crazy. Even more so now. It\u2019s crazy to write a diary and remember all the things we did and even the surprise of where we found ourselves when we woke up,\u201d she said in a recent interview.\n\nBirkin, who has made 13 albums and starred in films and plays, and was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2002, says she conducted her life and love affairs with \u201can absolutely unfounded optimism\u201d, but stopped writing her diary on the evening her daughter Kate died. (Shortly afterwards, the leukaemia returned requiring intensive treatment; she is now in remission.)\n\n\u201cHow could I write after that? ... it was like I was living a parallel life. The carpet had been pulled from under my feet. I fell ill... and why not,\u201d she writes.", "description": "The singer opens up about her tumultuous relationships with the \u2018bad boy\u2019 of French music and her late daughter", "authors": ["Kim Willsher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/558f74a1340e73651c25cc7ed2b75351f05df121/72_521_4641_2784/master/4641.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b05ddf213fd6f78e7c03127d0a0f8746", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
