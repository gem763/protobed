They said Mugabe did not want his death to be exploited by his successors for political gain.\n\nA meeting on Thursday between Mugabe\u2019s family and officials at his home in Harare ended without agreement. Walter Chidhakwa, a spokesman for the family, said the funeral would go ahead but not the planned burial.\n\nEarlier, Emmerson Mnangagwa, who succeeded Mugabe as president, said he had appealed to the family to set aside any bitterness. They are reportedly unhappy about his treatment of the former leader.\n\n\u201cLet bygones be bygones. The family is going to lead the programme, that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t released anything. We haven\u2019t agreed how he will be buried,\u201d Mnangagwa said.\n\nThe president, a veteran of the ruling Zanu-PF party and a decades-long close associate of Mugabe, said: \u201cWe will have to sit down first with Grace. As government there\u2019s nothing we will do to go against your wishes. Let\u2019s unite, he was our father.\u201d\n\nMugabe died in a clinic in Singapore last week, aged 95. His body arrived on Wednesday, on a government-chartered private jet, at Zimbabwe\u2019s main airport, where thousands of supporters had gathered.\n\nOn Thursday his casket was taken to a sports stadium in Harare, where thousands packed the stands to see him lie in state. Several people were injured in a crush as they surged forward to try to view the casket, with some carried away on stretchers. The severity of their injuries was not immediately clear.\n\nRiot police later restored order, at times using batons to strike people.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A casualty is rushed off the field after a stampede at the Rufaro stadium in Harare on Thursday.

A military helicopter later returned the casket to Mugabe\u2019s Blue Roof house in the capital.\n\nThough much of his 37 years in power were marked by violence, economic mismanagement and corruption, the former guerrilla fighter is still revered as a liberation leader. Many in Zimbabwe see him as a national hero, remembering his role in the war against white rule.", "description": "Family says former Zimbabwe leader will be buried at home, against authorities\u2019 wishes", "authors": ["Nyasha Chingono", "Jason Burke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/266f462e68342a9a33b75116a866fad6ccde2a7f/0_168_4308_2585/master/4308.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d76b82e7784964a0b3fd8675ae9231d3", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
