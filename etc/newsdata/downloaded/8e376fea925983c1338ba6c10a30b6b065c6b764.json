All are being spread as part of a promotional effort to sell a book. It\u2019s outrageous. So, after not speaking out to protect my children, it is now with their full support I say 'enough.'\"\n\n\"Catch and Kill\" is scheduled to be released on Tuesday.\n\nFox News' Liam Quinn and Brian Flood contributed to this report.", "description": "The Variety reporter who initially broke news of allegations against former NBC News anchor Matt Lauer reacted Friday to journalist Ronan Farrow's new book.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/694940094001_6094240682001_6094236642001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
