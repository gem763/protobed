You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt\u2019s also given the biggest boost yet to a discreet trend to put traditional French cooking back on an agenda from which it had been banished by a new generation as passe and dull.\n\nThe leisure guide Bristol 24/7 lists four French restaurants against 56 Italian, 59 British, 117 Asian and two Polish.\n\nHardly any of the fashionable young chefs of the last couple of decades have made France a model, preferring Spain, Italy, North Africa, the Middle East, and Scandinavia for inspiration.\n\nOnly the Michelin starred Wilks, run by an alumnus of the famous Auvergne maestro Michel Bras, deals in classic French technique, but without claiming so explicitly.\n\nBird's restaurant also eschews clich\u00e9 Frenchness. The menus are mainly in the staccato manner of modern British.\n\nCoffee vocabulary is standard Aussie-speak: a flat white rather than the grand creme of French usage. Bread is sourdough, not white baguette.\n\nThe waiting staff dress casually: \u201cSomebody suggested long white aprons, but I didn\u2019t want that\u201d says Bird. Even the food isn\u2019t obsessively French purist. Bird doesn\u2019t bother much with cookbooks \u2013 Richard Olney, old Elizabeth David, Stephane Renaud\u2019s Ripailles occasionally \u2013 and composes menus from his head, generally around the wines, which he chooses first.\n\nBut his excellent rich sauces pared with perfectly grilled or roast meat and fish \u2013 b\u00e9arnaise with a whole guinea fowl for two, vierge with saute courgette flowers, mustard with a plump French rabbit \u2013 and his textbook frites \u2013 two sacks of special Koffman\u2019s spuds a day chopped by hand, oil-blanched, then fried \u2013 are state of the craft.\n\nGiven the tremendous pressure the kitchen\u2019s been under, the occasional glitch an overly liquid mustard sauce, a slightly too dense cr\u00e8me Chantilly, a challengingly al dente green bean \u2013 is entirely understandable, and will soon be eliminated as Bird\u2019s about to hire a second chef. Just in time for the autumn, with the first cepe mushrooms, and grouse, and succulent pre-testosterone venison, when Len has time to swap the Black and Decker for a rifle.\n\nBird lives with his half French wife and partner Nessa and family just round the corner in Westbury on Trym, a mile from where he was born.\n\nHe\u2019s a fixture of the Bristol restaurant scene, and ironically a pillar of the movement which swept away the old French dominance. After starting work in Moro, Bird was hired in 2008 for his experience with wood fired cooking and Mediterranean repertoire by entrepreneur Arne Ringner to head the kitchen in his new Bristol Lido, and then the equally successful Reading version.\n\nBut Freddy \u201cwanted his own train set to play with\u201d. His first venture was not originally intended to be French, but Bird has further openings in his sights, including something with \u201ca Middle Eastern vibe\u201d \u2013 but the site, a long narrow former tapas bar perfect for a classic row of banquette tables, begged to be made a neighbourhood bistro. And indeed the cosiness of the seating and the buzzing ambience do bring to mind fashionable but adult Parisian classics like La Regalade or Le Bon Saint Pourcain.\n\nLittlefrench constitutes a new and interesting episode in the story of French influence in this food conscious corner of the UK. Half a century ago, luminaries like Keith Floyd and Stephen Markwick of the seminal Bistro 21 still looked primarily to France for inspiration.\n\nIn 1986 when the Lido entrepreneur Arne Ringner, then a Swedish horticulturalist turned novice caterer, created the Glass Boat restaurant, the first of what turned out to be one of Bristol\u2019s most cannily successful catering empires, his primer too was Elizabeth David.\n\nCoincidentally, the still flourishing Glass Boat staged a French-oriented menu re-vamp two years ago, even adding the word brasserie to its name, an error Ringner has just thought better of. Nowadays, he says, British food incorporates numerous influences, of which French is merely one, and is often better at it than the French anyway.\n\nIn fact, Bristol\u2019s Francophile restaurateurs have long Anglicized their subject matter. There\u2019s the now common inclusion of steak tartare as a starter rather than main course. There\u2019s the Provencale fish soup containing both aioli and rouille, instead of just the latter, a practice made famous \u2013 well, famous in Bristol \u2013 by Stephen Markwick, who got it via Joyce Molyneux of the Carved Angel in Dartmouth from the legendary George Perry Smith, the Bocuse of Bath, unto whom it was probably revealed in an apparition by the Holy Spirit. Bird already has his own entry, a hybrid of tartare and hollandaise sauces which he serves with the spectacular whole roast turbot.\n\nLittlefrench is in fact the latest contender in a mini Gallic revival which has bubbled under for half a dozen years. Five years ago Bar Buvette, loosely modelled on the new breed of Parisian natural wine bar, was one of the foodie hits of the decade, but is now closed.\n\nBar Buvette\u2019s English owner has just returned to his French countryside auberge, and with the local branch of Raymond Blanc\u2019s brasserie chain closing this month, the French renaissance is somewhat diminished, no disrespect to the excellent steak frites the two remaining outposts of the Cote chain.\n\nWhich means the ball is almost exclusively in the court of Freddy Bird. Almost, because there is one other contender, a newcomer called La Guinguette, a misnomer which would be better attached to the Glass Boat, since it denotes a riverside entertainment place.\n\nLa Guingette\u2019s engaging young Parisian owners Jerome, Ophelie and Ronane aren\u2019t coy with a French clich\u00e9, festooning the joint lavishly with tricolour pendants and repro Suze posters.\n\nThey serve good charcuterie, modestly priced wines by the glass and a random assortment of rudimentary French staples. Best of all, they offer excellent no nonsense Paris standard service, which probably contributes significantly to La Guinguette\u2019s success with older clientele, relieved of the obligation of tutting at every new interruption from a young server enquiring how you guys are getting on? La Guinguette has one other very French attribute.\n\nPopping down to ask a few questions over a glass of Cremant de Bordeaux Rose, I found the place closed for August. You can\u2019t get more authentically Parisian than that.", "description": "\u201cIt has been pretty amazing\u201d, agrees Freddy Bird, sitting at one of his new copper topped tables while commis chefs prep vegetables for lunch, barmen lug cases of wine, and Len the carpenter/ deer hunter installs the new kitchen fittings Freddy had decided prudently not to afford just yet. \u201c I was standing outside last week on the phone and taxis kept pulling up, people coming", "authors": ["Philip Sweeney"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/05/19/freddy-bird-chef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
