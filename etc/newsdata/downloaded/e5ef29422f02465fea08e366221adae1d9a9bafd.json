Her call for action comes just days after health officials urged people to stop vaping until they can figure out why hundreds have been diagnosed with serious lung illnesses.\n\nOfficials have identified about 450 possible cases of illnesses, including at least five deaths in 33 states. They\u2019ve yet to identify a single vaping device, liquid or ingredient common among all patients, but many involved THC.\n\nMany of the cases involve teens, some of whom have come forward to describe their illnesses and subsequent hospitalizations in a bid to decrease use among their peers. A Snapchat user identified as Hunter Sims sent a warning from what appeared to be his hospital bed. A friend took a screenshot and posted it to his own Twitter account.\n\n'PREGNANT' WOMAN'S 'BABY BUMP' WAS ACTUALLY CANCEROUS GROWTH\n\nSims started his warning simply by writing \u201cVAPING IS DANGEROUS,\u201d before going on to explain that he used vapes and has been hospitalized with no improvement for five days despite various medications.\n\n\u201cMy lung capacity is one mouthful,\u201d Sims claimed in the Snap. \u201cI can\u2019t turn to the side in bed without having a bad respiratory attack, I literally have CDC members taking notes on me and the girl in the room next to me (she\u2019s also in critical condition). There are doctors saying I might need a medically induced coma. The doctors don\u2019t even know quite how to treat, or if we\u2019ll survive. So trust me when I say it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d\n\nAnother teen in Utah said she will \u201cnever touch a vape again\u201d after she was placed in a medically induced coma, with her family unsure if she would ever recover. She has since been released from the hospital but said she is still dealing with pain in her lungs and shortened breath.\n\nIn Alabama, educators in one district went so far as to remove the doors on bathroom stalls to prevent students from bringing banned e-cigarettes into schools after finding one student passed out in the bathroom two weeks ago.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nE-cigarettes do have potential to help adult and non-pregnant women quit smoking, but they are not safe for youth, young adults, pregnant women or adults who do not currently use tobacco products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The agency notes that scientists still have a lot to learn about whether e-cigarettes are effective for quitting smoking, and that additional research is needed to understand long-term health effects.", "description": "The first lady said she is \"deeply concerned about the growing epidemic of e-cigarette use in our children.\"", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/09/694940094001_6084656956001_6084655057001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
