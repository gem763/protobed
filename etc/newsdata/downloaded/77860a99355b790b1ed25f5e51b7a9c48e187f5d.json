Her mother was fun-loving, but her father was more buttoned-up and a bit of a nag. He was, she says, \u2018always checking to make sure we had been to the lavatory properly\u2019, though, annoyingly, she fails to elaborate on either how he checked or what \u2018properly\u2019 might mean in these circumstances.\n\nAnne Glenconner with her husband books Colin, 3rd Baron Glenconner, and on the island of Mustique, 1973. He bought the island in 1958 for \u00a345,000\n\nHolkham Hall was full of servants, \u2018some of whom had very distinctive characters\u2019. We are left to imagine what their distinctive characters might have been, though she tells us that Mr Patterson, the head gardener, would play the bagpipes in the mornings \u2018until my mother would shout, \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough, Mr Patterson, thank you!\u201d\u2019\n\nShe had a horrid governess called Miss Bonner, who would punish her by tying her hands to the back of the bed and leaving her bound up all night. She deals with this in just three sentences \u2013 she is stalwartly unself-pitying \u2013 but it\u2019s clear that Miss Bonner was criminally abusive. Years later, she received a card from Miss Bonner congratulating her on her engagement \u2013 it \u2018triggered the most unpleasant rush of memories and made me physically sick\u2019. For all its obvious absurdities, this book is underpinned by honesty.\n\nAged 16, Anne was sent off to finishing school, where \u2018twenty-five girls per year were taught how to run a big house \u2013 their big house\u2019. This largely involved flower-arranging and making drop scones, as well as learning \u2018to perfect our conversation skills\u2019. After all, \u2018having the confidence to be the figurehead of a community, make little speeches and present awards was a skill that girls like me needed\u2019.\n\nHer father really wanted her to marry the improbably named Lord Stair, largely because he was such a good shot. But Lord Stair was the same age as her father, and Lady Anne was still a teenager. \u2018He\u2019s very nice, but no,\u2019 said Lady Anne.\n\nInstead, she \u2018fell madly in love\u2019 with \u2018funny, handsome and charming\u2019 Johnnie Althorp, but she made the fatal mistake of introducing him to the wicked Lady Fermoy, who then went and grabbed him for her own daughter. (The couple later gave birth to the girl who grew up to become Princess Diana.)\n\nBut every cloud has a silver lining. Soon, Anne was asked to be a Maid of Honour at the Queen\u2019s Coronation, while her mother was asked to be a Lady of the Bedchamber no less. But they were both knocked into a cocked hat by the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire \u2018because, as Mistress of the Robes, it was her job to assist the 5th Marquess of Cholmondeley, the Lord Great Chamberlain, who helped with the Queen\u2019s costume changes\u2019. Game, set and match!\n\nShe then fell in love with Colin Tennant, the son of 2nd Baron Glenconner. She describes young Colin as \u2018terribly handsome\u2019, though the photographs don\u2019t bear this out. He was as bald as a coot. Her father considered his family nouveau riche because they had made their fortune from bleach. Colin also had \u2018an unfortunate temper\u2019. Might she have been better off with the 2nd Lord Harpic, or the 3rd Earl of Ajax?\n\nTheir honeymoon was a disaster, largely because she was \u2018totally inexperienced\u2019 when it came to sex. The first night \u2018was awkward, painful\u2019 and \u2018Colin was obviously dissatisfied, which made me feel terribly awkward\u2019. Awkward is one of her favourite words, others being \u2018tiresome\u2019, \u2018palaver\u2019 and \u2018frightfully\u2019. Prince Philip, for instance, is \u2018frightfully bossy\u2019.\n\nPrincess Margaret with the couple in 1972. For nearly 30 years Anne was a Lady-In-Waiting to Princess Margaret\n\nThe next night, Colin took her to a brothel and made her watch a naked couple having sex. \u2018I found it perfectly disgusting.\u2019 The couple asked if she would like to join in. \u2018That\u2019s very kind of you, but no thank you,\u2019 she replied, politely. Who knows? Perhaps they had taught her the correct response at finishing school.\n\nColin had promised that, once they were married, he\u2019d never lose his temper again. This proved not to be the case. On the Queen Mary she left a porthole open, and they were drenched. \u2018Colin was incandescent, accusing me of having done it on purpose.\u2019 He caught a cold and had to stay in bed, leaving Anne on her own to explore the ship, which was \u2018quite a relief\u2019.\n\nColin\u2019s explosive temper pops up all over the book, so that it is almost a character in its own right. In Cuba he took her to a cock fight, and when a cockerel grabbed on to her head, and its spurs dug into her scalp, causing blood to drip down her face, Colin was \u2018absolutely furious, shouting at me that I had ruined the cock fight and ruined all the bets that had been placed\u2019.\n\nIT'S A FACT In 2018, the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court awarded half of Baron Glenconner\u2019s estate, some \u00a320m, to his grandson, Cody.\n\nShe insists that Colin had abundant qualities, with a \u2018combination of intense charm, quick wit and intelligence\u2019 but she provides no examples, unless you count his party trick of wearing paper knickers then putting his hands down his trousers, ripping them off and stuffing them into his mouth. For all Lady Glenconner\u2019s special pleading, he comes across as a thoroughly nasty piece of work: self-centred, feckless, snobbish and cruel. \u2018I once asked him why he screamed at people, and he replied, \u201cI like making them squirm. I like making them frightened.\u201d\u2019\n\nIs the entire book an unconscious act of revenge?\n\nHe was, needless to say, serially unfaithful, with \u2018lots of girlfriends, some I knew of, others I didn\u2019t\u2019. One of them was an \u2018African American lady, for whom he had bought a nail bar in America. I only found out about her when she went to the press and I read about how he had broken her wrist. Hopefully her wrist healed well enough for her to carry on doing people\u2019s nails.\u2019\n\nFor nearly 30 years Anne was a Lady-In-Waiting to Princess Margaret. This was a relatively undemanding position, not unlike a nanny. \u2018When we arrived somewhere new, I did things like find out where the lavatories were so that she wouldn\u2019t have to ask.\u2019 She sometimes had to undertake more peculiar chores, like turning the hose on Princess Michael\u2019s cats.\n\nThroughout it all, she loved Princess Margaret \u2013 \u2018We became firm friends\u2019 \u2013 but theirs was a lopsided friendship, with Princess Margaret issuing the commands and Anne obeying them. Anne and Colin gave Princess Margaret a piece of land on Mustique as a wedding present. \u2018Does it come with a house?\u2019 asked Princess Margaret, so they were obliged to agree that it did. When they went swimming in Mustique, Anne would have to swim sideways, treading water, so that they could continue a conversation. Having written a book about Margaret, I was worried that there would be lots of information about her that I had failed to unearth. But apart from one or two little catchphrases \u2013 \u2018What about another little drinkie-winkie?\u2019 \u2013 there isn\u2019t much new.\n\nTwo-thirds of the way through the book, the atmosphere darkens. Up to that point, the tone has been jolly, camp and slightly daft, like so many aristocratic memoirs. But all of a sudden, tragedy piles upon tragedy. Two of her sons die young, one from Aids at 29, and another at 39 from the after-effects of heroin addiction. Her third son suffers a devastating motorbiking accident on his gap year. She and Colin fly out to be with him. During the flight, \u2018much to Colin\u2019s irritation, I just couldn\u2019t stop crying\u2019.\n\nWhen Colin died in 2010 he left all his fortune to a Trinidadian servant on whom he had developed some sort of fixation, and nothing at all to Anne, his long-suffering wife of 54 years. \u2018I screamed and screamed and screamed into the pitch-black night,\u2019 she recalls.\n\nBut she is a trouper and refuses to let life get her down. She now lives by herself in a modest house in Norfolk. \u2018At the age of 87,\u2019 she concludes, \u2018I am very happy.\u2019", "description": "If Lord 'Downton Abbey' Fellowes ever took LSD, he would doubtless start dictating a book like this.", "authors": ["Craig Brown Event For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/12/20188132-0-image-a-25_1572091142225.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
