Harvard researchers say this is what successful people do when making small talk", "language": "en", "text": "\"How are you?\" These are the three most useless words in the world of communication. The person asking doesn't really want to know, and the person responding doesn't tell the truth. What follows is a lost opportunity and meaningless exchange with zero connection. But the key to making the most out of small talk, according to Harvard researchers, is to simply ask the other person follow-up questions. In a series of experiments, researchers analyzed more than 300 online conversations and found that those who were asked more meaningful follow-up questions (a.k.a. questions that aren't \"how are you?\" or \"what do you do?\"), found the other person much more likable. \"When people are instructed to ask more questions, they are perceived as higher in responsiveness, an interpersonal construct that captures listening, understanding, validation and care,\" the researchers wrote. So how do you move from tongue-tied to being a charismatic and interesting person? It depends on the question you start with, and then you can focus on the stream of follow-up questions. Here are seven tactics to having a meaningful conversation:\n\n1. Use the A.C.T. trick to start a connection\n\nWhen was the last time you were in a meeting that didn't start with small talk? It's a natural way for people to connect. Start with a question that will build up to a conversation that meets the A.C.T. criteria: A - There's a uthenticity\n\n- There's uthenticity C - There's a c onnection\n\n- There's a onnection T - There's a topic that will give them taste of who you are Some of those questions might be: \"What's your current state of mind?\"\n\n\"What are you looking forward to this week?\"\n\n\"You remind me of a celebrity, but I can't remember which one \u2014 who's someone you relate to?\"\n\n2. Move beyond the \"hourly update\"\n\nThe fallback for a lot of people is like the newscast \"hourly update\" \u2014 traffic, sports, weather and so on. Drill this into your head: It is a horrible icebreaker. There are a few exceptions, like if it's a genuine interest of yours and your boss or colleague shares that passion. But try to move beyond those clich\u00e9 topics to things that are more important and personal to you.\n\n3. Be in the moment and observe your surroundings\n\nOpen your eyes before you open your mouth. Find something to focus on in your surroundings, like the piece of art on the wall, a quirky gadget or family picture on their desk, a race car helmet, scattered coins from various countries and so on. There's bound to be something that will spark small talk and help lead the conversation into unique follow-up questions.\n\nOpen your eyes before you open your mouth. Gary Burnison CEO, Korn Ferry\n\nLet's say you're talking to the CEO of a large, iconic company who is about to retire, and you noticed a row of empty boxes along the wall of the CEO's office. You might start with the question, \"How hard is it for you to leave this job?\" This will lead to a much deeper and more emotionally revealing discussion, and it never would've happened had you not noticed those boxes.\n\n4. Share some news (that actually happened)\n\nIf you have \"news,\" share it: \"I adopted a pet over the weekend\" or \"My 6-year-old rode a bike for the first time yesterday!\" Believe it or not, most people actually do want to know more about others, especially if they both work at the same company. If you're new to a company and leading a team, for example, start your first meeting by going around the room and asking each person to say one interesting thing that recently happened in their lives. As a result of that momentary sharing, you've allowed everyone to feel more personally and genuinely connected with each other. The objective to is be genuine and not simply make something up. Otherwise, you run the risk of not knowing how to answer follow-up questions about something you have little or no experience with.\n\n5. Talk early\n\nWhether you're meeting in person or dialing in for a conference call, talk early. If you wait, two things will probably happen: One, someone else will make the comment you wanted to make and, two, your more talkative colleagues will take over with their own follow-up questions. You'll get lost in the cross-talk and miss your chance.\n\n6. It's not just what you say\n\nNo matter what or how much you say, your tone of voice, facial expression and eye contact will broadcast so much more. In person, look at the other person when you speak, not at the conference table or the wall. On the phone, smile \u2014 it will make your voice sound warmer. It's not just what you say, but how you say it, that will help others connect with you.\n\n7. Make the pivot\n\nThis is where small talk goes to the next level, as you segue from talking about something small to the issue at hand. If the conversation is already flowing, it will be easier than you think and ask follow-up questions. Your boss could be the one to make the first step, \"So, tell me what's going on with [X].\" Thanks to the small talk, you'll already be in sync. You can then pivot to a more meaningful discussion that showcases your knowledge, contribution and confidence.\n\nJust do it", "description": "Next time you're in the elevator with your boss, avoid using the three most useless words in the world of communication: \"How are you?\" \u2014 and you'll be amazed by where the conversation goes.", "authors": ["Gary Burnison"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104671679-GettyImages-138418059.jpg?v=1532563773", "published_at": "2019-03-07"}
