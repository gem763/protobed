But, as has become the norm at FedEx Field, many fans weren\u2019t there to root for the home team.\n\nWith more than half the crowd decked out in Patriots blue and white, wearing Tom Brady and Julian Edelman jerseys and cheering every New England touchdown, Washington fans including Brian Costello, who became a season ticket-holder in 2015, found themselves visitors in their own stadium.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of sad,\u201d said Mr. Costello, a lifelong fan sporting a burgundy-and-gold \u201cFire Bruce Allen\u201d shirt. \u201cYou just come here to tailgate, to hang out. You know, it doesn\u2019t matter because it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nNew England\u2019s dominance on the field \u2014 the Patriots won 33-7 \u2014 and takeover in the stands on Sunday marked new low points in a season full of them for a franchise off to its worst start since 2001. With the Redskins among the league\u2019s worst this season, the franchise finds itself, after years of disappointment and mediocrity, struggling to recapture the attention of Washington fans.\n\nOverall attendance is up for Redskins home games. Entering Sunday, Washington ranked 11th in the NFL with 71,227 fans per home game \u2014 up 16.4% over 2018. Unfortunately for the storied franchise, the increase seems to be coming from the opposing teams\u2019 fans flooding into FedEx.\n\nDallas Cowboys fans in Week 2 and Chicago Bears fans in Week 3 appeared to occupy at least half the seats. On Sunday, Patriots fans were clearly the majority.\n\nWhen the Redskins\u2018 offense was backed up to its own 3-yard line, a loud \u201cDe-fense!\u201d chant began. Hands shot up in celebration all around the lower bowl when Edelman scored a big catch-and-run, followed by a Sony Michel touchdown. Supportive chants of \u201cBra-dy\u201d echoed throughout the fourth quarter.\n\nPatriots coach Bill Belichick was among those weighing in on the intensity of support for the visitors.\n\n\u201cOh my God, it was amazing,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cAwesome,\u201d New England receiver Josh Gordon said. \u201cRidiculous,\u201d Brady said.\n\nTickets for the Patriots game were hotter than for either of the Redskins\u2018 first two home games. According to TickPick, a secondary ticket website, the average purchase price for the Patriots game was $259.34 as of Friday \u2014 more than the $255 for the Cowboys and $131 for the Bears.\n\nThere were thousands of Patriots fans, some who flew in from Massachusetts and others living around the area who jumped at the chance to see their favorite team. Jerry and Dylan Spence left their Newport News, Virginia, home at 6 a.m. and drove three hours to see the Patriots for the first time. The father-son duo spent approximately $900 to sit two rows behind New England\u2019s bench.\n\nAdam Law and his parents, Bill and Michelle Law, are New England fans who hail from Massachusetts but now live in Virginia. They said they drive to FedEx Field every eight years when the Patriots are scheduled to visit.\n\n\u201cUsually the home-field advantage is something special,\u201d Adam Law said. \u201cHome-field advantage usually makes a difference on defense. I think generally, what it really means is that nobody\u2019s going to have the home-field advantage during this one, necessarily.\u201d\n\nThe home-field advantage was certainly lacking. ESPN anchor Scott Van Pelt, a Maryland native, took to Twitter to call the Redskins\u2018 game \u201canother road game at home\u201d after seeing pictures of the Patriots-heavy crowd.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many people I know who feel the same way I do now. Absolutely indifferent,\u201d Mr. Van Pelt tweeted. \u201cThat would have been impossible to believe not too long ago.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s situation won\u2019t improve anytime soon. With the Redskins\u2018 0-5, it\u2019s easy to imagine fans staying home for a losing team.\n\nFedEx\u2019s lease, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t expire until 2027. Team President Bruce Allen said in a radio interview over the summer that the Redskins could announce plans for a new stadium \u201cwithin a year.\u201d Washington officials have had discussions with Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia for its new home, but D.C. appears to be the front-runner.\n\nAt a panel event at the University of the District of Columbia on Friday, Mayor Muriel Bowser said she would like to see a new stadium on the RFK site. The city has announced plans to tear down the former RFK stadium in 2021.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to chase them down, and we\u2019d like them [to] be winners when they come,\u201d Ms. Bowser said, according to the Washington Business Journal. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re in the position to beg for this type of development. We have a great site, we think the best site in the region. And when the time is right, we\u2019re going to make sure the site is activated.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, more and more fans are declaring their hopelessness. In December, Mr. Costello left a Redskins game at halftime for the first time ever as the team was down 34-0 in a blowout loss to the New York Giants. He found the customized shirt calling for Mr. Allen\u2019s firing not long afterward.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
