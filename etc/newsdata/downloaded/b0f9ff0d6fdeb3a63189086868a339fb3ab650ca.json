'I\u2019m sure you will\u201d\n\nMr Corbyn said: \"I want to thank you Mr Speaker for the way that you've used your speakership in the decade-long tenure you've had.\n\n\"You've done so much to reform this House of Commons and our democracy is the stronger for the way that you've done it.\"\n\nHe also joked: \"You've served for ten years, you've given real power to backbenchers, vastly expanded the use of urgent questions which has been overwhelmingly popular with all Government ministers, and opened up the number of emergency debates, which is even more popular with even more Government ministers.\"", "description": "The Speaker has been a thorn in the side of the Prime Minister and Tory Brexiteers", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20756760.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT-VOTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
