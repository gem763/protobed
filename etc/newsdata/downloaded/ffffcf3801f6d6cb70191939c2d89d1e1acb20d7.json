You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, Comer can be heard whispering the word \"Loewe\" to herself, pronounced \"Low-ev-ay\".\n\nThe 26-year-old's voice gradually become louder as she continuously repeats the word, her eyes welling up and a feigned smile dawning on her face.\n\nComer appears to become increasingly agitated, fanning herself and saying \"Loewe\" over and over again at an increasingly rapid pace.\n\nHer cheerfulness turns to sadness before switching to rage, encapsulating the multifaceted spectrum of emotions which the star's lethal character on Killing Eve has become known for.\n\nThe dramatic nature of the film peaks as Comer leans towards her dressing room table mirror, a single tear falling down her cheek.\n\nThe film ends with a final utterance of the word \"Loewe\" from Comer, said in a half-whisper as the actor turns away from the mirror and gracefully gestures with her left hand.\n\nSeveral YouTube users praised Comer for her performance in the short film, which was directed by actor Benn Northover.\n\n\"A masterclass in acting. She literally said one word,\" one person wrote.\n\n\"You can submit this vid alone to the Emmys and she will [win] another award,\" another fan remarked.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Comer won the Emmy Award for lead actress in a drama series for Killing Eve.\n\nThe actor won the accolade over her co-star Sandra Oh, in addition to her peers Emilia Clarke, Viola Davis, Laura Linney, Mandy Moore and Robin Wright\n\nTo take a look at all the best-dressed stars who attended the awards ceremony in Los Angeles, click through the gallery below.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
