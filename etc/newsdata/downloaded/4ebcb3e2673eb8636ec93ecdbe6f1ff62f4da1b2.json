One Senate Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, said the transcript\u2019s release was a \u201chuge mistake\u201d that the GOP now has to confront and defend\u2014 while the party argues at the same time that House Democrats are overreaching with their impeachment inquiry of Trump. . . . \u201cIt remains troubling in the extreme. It\u2019s deeply troubling,\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters Wednesday, when asked about the transcript.\n\nWell, that is one way of putting it. To be sure, Trump\u2019s ridiculous lackeys in the Senate have tried to suggest there is nothing in the transcripts to be concerned about, but that is not even flying with everyone in their own caucus.\n\n\n\nSen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) speaks to reporters after a Senate Republican caucus luncheon Sept. 10. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nEven Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who had cast aside any qualms about Trump and given up criticism of the president, acknowledged it would be \u201creally, really bad\u201d for a foreign power to get involved in our election. More troubling still, Sasse later in the day declared that \u201cRepublicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons to say there\u2019s no there there when there\u2019s obviously lots that\u2019s very troubling there.\u201d Uh-oh.\n\nI would suggest that the entire political calculus involving Trump, his presidency and the 2020 election has shifted dramatically in the past 24 hours. Trump has been caught red-handed trying to enlist a foreign power in digging up dirt on a political opponent as he dangled U.S. aid to that country. What is more, Trump was too clueless to realize how damaging this was. His fitness for office and his political judgment as a candidate for reelection are so obviously defective that Republicans would be silly to rally behind him. From now until 2020 they will be asked over and over again: Do you condone this conduct? It is impossible for any of them to seriously defend what has been revealed already in the rough transcript.\n\n[The Post\u2019s View: The Trump-Zelensky readout is a devastating indictment of our president]\n\nCosta\u2019s reporting also finds that \u201cOne early divide among Senate Republicans is between the \u2018Burr camp\u2019 and the \u2018Johnson camp,\u2019 according to two senior GOP aides who were not authorized to speak publicly, referring to Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. Burr\u2019s faction of the Senate GOP has a darker, frustrated view of Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine, while Johnson has linked the Ukraine issue to his committee\u2019s work into reviewing the launch of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails while serving as secretary of state.\u201d It is a mystery why Johnson should throw himself into the fire for Trump, especially since details of the whistleblower complaint, a potentially even more damaging document, have yet to come out.\n\nThe first guideline for Republicans who want to survive this debacle is to stay out of the \u201cJohnson camp.\u201d The ability to distract the public and waylay the press is minimal at this point; every news outlet in the country and every reasonable voter who cares to read the transcript knows Trump\u2019s actions are beyond the pale. Whether they are on the ballot in 2020, the last thing they want is video of them defending this sort of lawlessness and/or carrying Trump\u2019s dirty water.\n\nSecond, Republicans should begin considering 2020 alternatives right now. Even if Trump survives this episode and all the other scandals (e.g., emoluments, self-dealing) he will in all likelihood be grievously damaged going into 2020. The states that have canceled primaries should strongly consider un-canceling them. A party must have options when the incumbent president is damaged as Trump already is.\n\n[Jennifer Rubin: Are Senate Republicans circling the wagons? Not so much.]\n\nThis also means that Republicans who had passed on a challenge, such as former Ohio governor John Kasich and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, should give serious consideration to getting into the race. The potential for Trump\u2019s support in the country at large and even within the GOP to plummet is real for the first time in his presidency. They should be candid about their role: The president, whatever Republicans think of him, is mortally wounded as a candidate for reelection. No one associated with this mess (e.g., Vice President Pence) will be able to take Trump\u2019s spot. They need a Republican entirely divorced from this behavior who has consistently called out Trump\u2019s corruption.\n\nRepublicans should recognize that their own political survival and that of the party\u2019s in 2020 will depend on the degree to which both can entirely dissociate themselves from Trump\u2019s abuses of power. That may be impossible for characters such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) who have appeased and enabled Trump from the start, but it is not too late for other Republicans to save themselves.\n\nRead more:\n\nHugh Hewitt: Impeachment-minded Democrats, welcome to Al Capone\u2019s vault.
