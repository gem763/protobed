REUTERS/Staff\n\nYields on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note US10YT=RR fell below 1.7% and stocks on Wall Street slid, leading a gauge of equity performance around the globe to pare gains and trade little changed.\n\nEuropean shares remained solidly in the black after the Chinese commerce ministry said the United States and China were making preparations to ensure \u201cpositive progress\u201d is made during the next round of trade negotiations.\n\nBut traders were closely watching a congressional hearing at which the acting director of U.S. national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, testified about the whistleblower report after refusing for weeks to share the report with Congress.\n\nConcerns about the whistleblower complaint triggered the rally in U.S. Treasury bonds, said Justin Lederer, Treasury analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.\n\nThe price of benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose 10/32 in price to push their yield down to 1.6973%.\n\n\u201cThe transcript of his call released yesterday did not seem to have anything specific that Trump said, \u2018do this for that,\u2019\u201d Lederer said.\n\n\u201cThe whistleblower complaint looks like there was more to it, but I don\u2019t know. Overall, it\u2019s just the idea that markets don\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d he added.\n\nMSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.01% while the pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.69%.\n\nOn Wall Street, The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 47.27 points, or 0.18%, to 26,923.44. The S&P 500 .SPX lost 8.46 points, or 0.28%, to 2,976.41 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 39.39 points, or 0.49%, to 8,037.99.\n\nFacebook Inc (FB.O) slipped 1.4% as a person familiar with the matter told Reuters that the U.S. Justice Department will open an antitrust investigation of the social media company.\n\nThe dollar edged lower against the euro, giving up some of the sizeable gains from the previous session, as the common currency recovered a little after sinking to a 28-month low amid an increasingly bleak euro zone economic outlook.\n\nIncreased political tensions on both sides of the Atlantic - the unfolding effort by U.S. congressional Democrats to impeach Trump and ongoing uncertainty regarding Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union - was likely to keep the greenback in demand, analysts said.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY fell 0.03%, with the euro EUR= up 0.04% to $1.0945. The Japanese yen JPY= strengthened 0.12% versus the greenback at 107.67 per dollar.\n\nCrude prices fell for a third straight day as Saudi Arabia\u2019s moves to restore output quickly after attacks on its oil installations promised yet more oil supply.\n\nBrent crude futures were down 52 cents at $61.87 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 72 cents to $55.77 a barrel.\n\n(Graphic - Japan stocks: cheap and profitable, here)\n\nFILE PHOTO: The London Stock Exchange Group offices are seen in the City of London, Britain, December 29, 2017.
