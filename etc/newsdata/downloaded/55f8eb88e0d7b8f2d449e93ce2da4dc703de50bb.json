It is not a handout to poor people, or to those who barely eke out a living, but a share in the prosperity this country has achieved by dint of the contributions of a vast majority of the people.\n\nOnly 4 in 10 Americans could cover a $1,000 unplanned expense, so a monthly payment of $1,000 as proposed by candidate Andrew Yang would go a long way in relieving the precariousness of their situation.\n\nIt is also worth noting that $250 a week is the amount the United Auto Workers is paying its members who are striking against General Motors Co. demanding to share in the profits GM generated after the workers\u2019 sacrifices in the bailout.\n\nThe argument for an earned income tax credit assumes that the recipient is working at a job earning an income. This ignores the fact that the pace of automation is rapidly increasing, threatening not only manufacturing jobs where robots are ubiquitous on factory floors, but also industries associated with driving, the food service industry, retail sales workers, those who work in warehouses and call centers, and all other jobs that are repetitive, including accountants and lawyers.\n\nOUR VIEW: Andrew Yang's 'freedom dividend' plan comes with big liabilities\n\nStockton, California, is trying a \"universal basic income\" program, which provides debit cards monthly to people who earn at or below a certain median household income.
