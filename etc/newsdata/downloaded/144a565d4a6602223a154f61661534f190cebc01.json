Grandal, who led NL catchers with 28 homers, is likely to decline his $16 million option, and Moustakas could be a free agent for the third straight offseason if either side declines the infielder\u2019s $11 million option.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly controversial that I\u2019d love to have both of them back,\u201d Brewers general manager David Stearns said Friday. \u201cThey are two very good players that fit with our organization and our team very well. Whether the realities of the free agent market permit that is something we will have to evaluate as we go through the offseason.\u201d\n\nMilwaukee finished second in the NL Central this year with an 89-73 record. The Brewers played the last part of the season without slugger Christian Yelich, who broke his right kneecap Sept. 10.\n\nMilwaukee was eliminated when it blew a three-run lead in a 4-3 loss to the Washington Nationals in the NL wild-card game Tuesday night.\n\nThe winning run scored in the eighth inning when rookie outfielder Trent Grisham, playing in place of Yelich, allowed Juan Soto\u2019s hard single to right to get past him for an error.\n\nStearns expressed confidence in Grisham.\n\n\u201cI would expect Trent to be a part of the team next year and have a prominent role on the team,\u201d Stearns said.\n\nStearns described the Brewers season as \u201cimperfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe battled injuries, we battled some inconsistent performance from key players, and we were still able to keep ourselves close enough so that a good run got us back to the playoffs,\u201d Stearns said.\n\nStearns also praised Yelich for putting together a season he felt exceeded his 2018 NL MVP campaign. Yelich won the NL batting title with a .329 average, becoming the first repeat champion since Colorado\u2019s Larry Walker in 1998-99.\n\n\u201cChristian never ceases to surprise me,\u201d Stearns said. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to have him.\u201d\n\nStearns said he expects the franchise\u2019s ownership group, led by principal owner Mark Attanasio, to continue to invest the necessary financial resources to field a competitive team on a yearly basis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have payrolls consistent with the biggest payrolls in baseball. That shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone,\u201d Stearns said. \u201cBut we do think that we can afford a team that can remain competitive and allow us to invest wisely where we see fit.\u201d\n\nThe Brewers drew 2.9 million fans to Miller Park this season, which ranked eighth in the majors and helped bolster the team\u2019s financial viability.\n\n\u201cWe have an incredibly loyal and passionate fan base and what we have accomplished as an organization over the last couple of years wouldn\u2019t have been remotely possible in a market like this without the unyielding support of this community,\u201d Stearns said. \u201cIt\u2019s evidenced, certainly, by the attendance numbers, which are kind of unthinkable in a market this size.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Milwaukee Brewers are hoping Yasmani Grandal and Mike Moustakas will be back next season after the team made back-to-back playoff appearances for just the second time in franchise history.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rich Rovito"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/brewers_nationals_baseball_02055_c0-162-3882-2425_s1770x1032.jpg?c2213cf2046a66f686e6c5655a4a04705f17c1a8", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
