But despite clearly suffering from the sting of defeat, the Australian grinned and gave an obvious answer to an obvious question when asked how, on reflection, he could have done things differently on fight night.\n\n\u201cNot get hit,\u201d he said. \u201cI went out there and I displayed my heart and I showed my skill sets and I just came off second best tonight. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019ll happen two times in a row.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re fighting at this high caliber, at this level, every fight is on the line. It\u2019s a tightrope. A lot of the fans don\u2019t realize that we\u2019re walking a tightrope out there and everybody can beat anybody. Tonight wasn\u2019t my night, but tomorrow might be.\u201d\n\nWhittaker\u2019s sense of frustration came from the belief that he was implementing his game plan well. He started the fight strongly and was arguably all set to take the opening round on the scorecards before being dropped with a perfectly-timed counter from Adesanya (18-0 MMA, 7-0 UFC).\n\nBut prior to that last-gasp, first-round knockdown, Whittaker had controlled the range well, staying on the outside, then blitzing in and connecting with shots before backing away again. It was a tactic he thought was bringing him success until Adesanya started to connect with his counters.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hit him on the outside,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s very long and he\u2019s very tall. I think any guy trying to get in on a tall fighter has to close that gap, and I was having a lot of success doing so. In that first round, I was hitting him, I was hurting him. I was doing work, I was doing damage. I felt really good out there. I felt like I was controlling the fight. Then I just got caught.\u201d\n\nAnd while he didn\u2019t get to use his wrestling skills in the fight, Whittaker said those skills are very much there. His success through much of the opening round suggested to him that he had a winning strategy. Then, as he admitted with a wry smile, things went wrong.\n\n\u201cI work my wrestling religiously,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think there\u2019s a misconception if I have good defensive wrestling I don\u2019t have good offensive wrestling. So it\u2019s in my arsenal \u2013 I just felt like I didn\u2019t need it. I was having success with my strikes, and I was doing well, until I wasn\u2019t. That\u2019s just how it happens.\u201d", "description": "Robert Whittaker faces the press with good humor, despite his knockout loss at UFC 243 in Melbourne, Australia.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Ken Hathaway", "Blue Corner", "Matt Erickson", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan", "John Morgan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/robert-whittaker-ufc-243-gettu.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
