Despite the tougher outlook on volume, both companies reported increased revenue (CP had a record quarter), higher adjusted profit and lower spending as a proportion of revenue in the third quarter.\n\nCP jumped 3.25 per cent to $296.45, while CN fell under one per cent to $115.96 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nStill, both railways already saw quarterly drops in shipments of metals and minerals, grain and potash, with CN also reporting a decline in forestry products. Specific culprits over the last three months include a late grain harvest and hiccups in Alberta\u2019s contracts for crude oil by rail, according to analysts.\n\nFor CP, potash was \u201cexceptionally weak\u201d due to delays in contract signings between producers and buyers in China and India, National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen noted to clients.\n\nDoerksen noted he wasn\u2019t surprised by the lower volume guidance from either company, but remained optimistic about the longer-term potential for shipments. The amount of crude by rail shipments are expected to increase when the Alberta government sorts out its contract situation, he noted, adding the government is trying to transfer its contracts to private industry.\n\nAlong with crude, Citi analyst Christian Wetherbee also noted a positive outlook for intermodal shipments. Top tier railroads generally posted strong performance when it comes to controlling costs this quarter, Wetherbee noted, which \u201csupports the belief that stocks can outperform in choppy markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat said, a better volume outlook is key to incremental upside,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBMO analyst Fadi Chamoun echoed that sentiment, noting to clients that CP exceeded expectations despite volume headwinds and a soft freight market.\n\nRailways may have muted their expectations for volumes around the bend, but the Bank of Canada took a more optimistic tone for the economy\u2019s direction this week. Aside from the Prairies where conditions remain tough, business sentiment slightly improved this fall, according to the bank\u2019s seasonal economic outlook survey.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: ejackson@nationalpost.com | Twitter: theemilyjackson", "description": "Lower forecasts come amid mounting fears of a recession and global trade tensions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trains.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
