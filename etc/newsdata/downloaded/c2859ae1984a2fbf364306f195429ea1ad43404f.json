Alex Ellinghausen\n\nParliamentary Budget Office head Jenny Wilkinson said there had been a notable dip in GST receipts and that while it did not hurt the federal budget it could create tensions between the federal government and the states.\n\n\"Weakness in GST receipts does not have a net impact on the budget, but there is lower transfers to states and governments. And there is a question there as to whether that creates pressure in federal state relations,\" Ms Wilkinson told a Senate estimates committee in Canberra on Monday.\n\nTotal GST receipts slipped 3.5 per cent to $6.26 billion in August from the month-earlier $6.49 billion because of a drop in household spending. The budget forecasts $69.63 billion for the full 2020 financial year.\n\nMs Wilkinson's comments come after renewed calls from NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet for a widening of GST and for stamp duties to be scrapped.", "description": "Falling goods and services tax revenue because of a weaker economy may lead to increased federal-state tensions, the Parliamentary Budget Office chief warns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1576%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_46/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a272d990e8895a2727fab76507cb19270c52cdb9", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
