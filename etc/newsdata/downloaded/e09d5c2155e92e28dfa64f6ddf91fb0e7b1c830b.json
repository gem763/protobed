It's difficult for me. I try to move them and play both.\n\n\"Never any player will be happy if they don't play regularly. He plays he will happy, he does not play he will not be happy.\n\n\"But I try to let them both play as much as possible. Sometimes when they're injured, Gabriel or Sergio, the other one plays.\n\n\"In some games Gabriel gives me something Sergio cannot give us. And the other games, Sergio gives us what Gabriel cannot. That is the quality.\n\n\"Normally I don't play with two strikers. I played with two against Norwich, in the last minutes, and it wasn't good. Our control isn't the best, we're not solid enough.\"\n\nGuardiola acknowledged he has to handle the striking dilemma sensitively, especially when both players are fit and in good form, and often finds himself apologising to one of the pair.\n\n\"They're upset if they don't play, of course,\" he added.\n\n\"You play a Champions League game, a semi-final or a quarter-final, and they are fit and they are strong.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"They want to play, and the manager says, 'You don't play'. How can they be happy? It's impossible. All I can say with the players is I'm sorry - I have to choose 11.\n\n\"Sergio could have scored five goals against Watford. Gabriel the last game against Preston could have scored three or four.\n\n\"We have many, many games, four competitions and of course everyone is necessary\".\n\nMeanwhile, Guardiola dismissed suggestions of strained relations between himself and Belgium midfielder Kevin De Bruyne.\n\nThe 28-year-old was left on the bench for City's 3-2 defeat at Norwich and responded with a commanding display in their 8-0 thrashing of Watford.\n\nGuardiola said in the aftermath of the win over the Hornets he was \"frustrated\" with aspects of De Bruyne's game but subsequently dismissed any notion the player had an attitude problem.\n\n\"When he's happy, his performance is incredible,\" Guardiola said.\n\n\"Like when I do my job, I'm happier so my job I do it better. I communicate better to my players.\n\n\"Sometimes I'm a bit down, I speak few words because not all the days I'm good. Sometimes I'm a little bit sad. It happens to me, it happens to you.\"", "description": "Keeping strikers Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus both happy is proving a challenge for Manchester City head coach Pep Guardiola.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VvM6diZ5iIG9msECbRM4dw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KekFcyfLkY4K5dGdOf6Bzg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/8fa27c29f017ddc3d36fd52a45c8cdde", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
