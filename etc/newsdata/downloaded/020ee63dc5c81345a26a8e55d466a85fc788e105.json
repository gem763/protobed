I will stay on for any autumn general election, but will be leaving by the end of the year.\"\n\nMr Fisher is said to have revealed his intention to quit last Saturday, according to a memo seen by the Sunday Times.\n\nThe newspaper reports that he criticised Mr Corbyn's team for their \"blizzard of lies\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Jeremy Corbyn intervened on a motion to abolish Labour's deputy leader\n\nMr Fisher's decision to quit emerged just hours after Mr Corbyn quashed a motion at his party conference on Saturday to oust his deputy, Mr Watson, by abolishing his position.\n\nAn initial attempt had been made at the Labour National Executive Committee (NEC) on Friday.\n\nMr Corbyn later suggested the role should be reviewed instead, and his suggestion was backed by the ruling NEC.\n\nHe has since told the Sunday Mirror he would like to see the party have two deputy leaders \"which reflects diversity within our society\".\n\nMr Corbyn told the newspaper one deputy leader would be a woman.\n\nHe added: \"Tom is the elected deputy leader of the party and so has an important role to play.\n\n\"I work with him and he's done very well on media reform, online gambling and exposing the way sugar has a deleterious affect on our lives.\"", "description": "Andrew Fisher, Labour's head of policy, will leave his post by the end of the year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/127B3/production/_108899657_21e48673-2de4-4d18-81ee-6174e13394a1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
