Many of them, and this may surprise you, don't seem like \"winning\" at all. More like losing. Consider:\n\n*Footage of Trump visiting a hospital in El Paso, Texas, following the mass shootings there last month. But that trip should hardly be described as a \"win.\" His boast that he got a large crowd the last time he was in El Paso and the infamous photo of Trump giving the thumbs up in a picture with a baby whose parents were murdered in the shootings are the two most memorable moments of that visit. (Not to mention Trump's falsehood that doctors were running out of operating rooms to greet him when he toured the hospital.) Plus, even if the El Paso visit had gone well, is comforting victims of a mass shooting really something that fits into a video on \"winning?\"\n\n*There's a series of quick cuts of Trump meeting with various world leaders -- from Qatar, Mongolia, Pakistan and Poland among others. Claiming those meetings as wins is like me claiming that answering emails every day is a win. It's just part of the job. Every president meets with foreign leaders. Claiming those meetings as wins is like telling your kid he's the big winner because he got the attendance award at school.", "description": "On Tuesday, the White House released a nearly two-minute video titled \"The Summer of Winning\" that documented a series of alleged -- you guessed it! -- wins for President Donald Trump and his administration over the summer.", "authors": ["Analysis Chris Cillizza", "Cnn Editor-At-Large"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190630035207-trump-dmz-19-super-tease.jpg"}
