The common ingredient used in baby powder, talc, is used in many cosmetic products and food like gum to absorb moisture and prevent caking. Products using talc do not have to undergo FDA review or approval before they go on the market, the FDA says.\n\nThis is the first time Johnson & Johnson is recalling its popular baby powder due to asbestos concerns in over 130 years. J&J said in a recent news release that the FDA tested its products no later than a month ago and found no asbestos in its products.\n\nIn an investigation last year, Reuters claimed that J&J knew of some products being tainted with asbestos and the company kept it secret from regulators and the public. J&J denies these claims and states \"Not only do we and our suppliers routinely test to ensure our talc does not contain asbestos, our talc has also been tested and confirmed to be asbestos-free by a range of independent laboratories, universities and global health authorities.\"\n\nThe company is recalling the United States Lot #22318RB of Johnson's Baby Powder, and if you or someone you know has a bottle from this lot, discontinue use of the product immediately.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The company is recalling \"out of an abundance of caution\".", "authors": ["Julia Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/f9oP7X6ls6CwesvWzfeZDA--~B/aD01MTQ7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/delish_597/b24bfd89340f29a9fafe5df7233d7a01", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
