But there\u2019s more to the British fashion designer Misha Nonoo than that incredible address book, discovers Julia Llewellyn Smith\n\nMisha wears the shirt she designed for Smart Works and her own-label skirt. The 33-year-old New York-based British fashion designer seems to know absolutely everybody\n\nYou could spend hours playing \u2018Six Degrees of Misha Nonoo\u2019. The 33-year-old New York-based British fashion designer seems to know absolutely everybody. Her recent wedding to oil heir Mikey Hess at the Villa Aurelia in Rome was attended by the likes of Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, Ivanka Trump, supermodel Karlie Kloss, Orlando Bloom and his fianc\u00e9e Katy Perry. Mikey apparently serenaded his bride, accompanied by Sir Paul McCartney and James Corden.\n\nBut two guests trumped all others \u2013 Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, with Meghan, dressed in a \u00a39,000 Valentino gown, reportedly carrying out the ceremony\u2019s only reading, the poem Vow by Roger McGough. The royal couple, who had left baby Archie at home, missed the La Dolce Vita-themed party the following day (the dress code was \u2018dazzling\u2019) at the Cinecitt\u00e0 film studios to fly home to prepare for their imminent tour of Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the royal pair were determined to attend. After all, it\u2019s rumoured it was Misha who set them up, organising their initial blind date; Harry, along with Prince William, was at Eton with Misha\u2019s ex-husband, online auctioneer Alexander Gilkes (whose brother once dated Pippa Middleton).\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t comment on that,\u2019 Misha says with a broad grin, when I ask if she was the matchmaker. Does everyone ask? \u2018Everyone, every time.\u2019 Will she ever crack and reveal all? \u2018Not as long as I\u2019ve still got everything going in the right way,\u2019 she chortles. \u2018But I\u2019m happy that Meghan and Harry are happy. They\u2019re very, very happy.\u2019\n\nWhoever played Cupid, what\u2019s remarkable is that Meghan and Misha\u2019s friendship remains as close as it ever was. After all, since that fateful night three years ago when Meghan, now 38, and Harry, 35, met for a drink, apparently in a London branch of private members\u2019 club Soho House (Misha and Meghan are both close friends of Markus Anderson, who works for the organisation), Meghan\u2019s life has changed beyond recognition. Then she was a carefree actress living between her native Los Angeles, New York and Toronto (where her TV drama Suits was filmed). Now she\u2019s a member of the Royal Family, living in the grounds of Windsor Castle with a tiny baby, and every move she makes is subject to intense scrutiny.\n\n\u2018I know you\u2019d think all that would make a difference to our friendship,\u2019 says Misha. \u2018But she hasn\u2019t changed as a friend at all, which I\u2019m so grateful for. She remains exactly the same person as always; equally committed, equally involved, incredibly thoughtful. And it\u2019s a great pleasure to be able to say that because friendships can change over the years: people move countries, they have children, they get married \u2013 it\u2019s the natural course of life. But she has been incredibly loyal.\u2019\n\nI suggest that it must blow Misha\u2019s mind to see her friend on every magazine cover in the world. \u2018I actually don\u2019t pay much attention to all that,\u2019 Misha says firmly but with a megawatt smile.\n\nVery diplomatic, but I don\u2019t buy it. Not least when I ask Misha, who was a guest at Meghan\u2019s New York baby shower \u2013 which many criticised for being overly lavish \u2013 how she feels about some of the harsh treatment meted out to Meghan in the press and on social media.\n\nMisha and Meghan at the launch of the duchess\u2019s fashion collection for Smart Works\n\n\u2018It\u2019s very unjust,\u2019 she says. \u2018People should focus on the good. She\u2019s such an incredible person and I am so proud of the work that she\u2019s done, because she has always been someone who has wanted to help other people. That was one of the first things we bonded over. That and dogs \u2013 she loves dogs!\u2019\n\nIf Misha\u2019s so fiercely loyal \u2013 and discreet \u2013 about her friend (she won\u2019t say if she\u2019s met baby Archie, or if she\u2019s one of his \u2018secret\u2019 godparents), it\u2019s clear why she inspires equal devotion from Meghan. On the Duchess\u2019s now deleted blog, The Tig, she describes Misha as \u2018chic, badass and cut from the cloth of women who don\u2019t take themselves too seriously, the kind of woman you instantly adore\u2019, which certainly echoes my first impression.\n\nWillowy and blonde, with a Grace Kelly air about her and dressed in her eponymous label\u2019s white Husband shirt (Meghan wore one along with a pair of ripped jeans for her first public date with Harry at the Invictus Games) and black Ivy trousers, Misha has a ready laugh and down-to-earth manner, unaffectedly chatting away about her adoration of her eight-year-old cavapoo dog Thatcher. (\u2018She\u2019s called that because she\u2019s the antithesis of the Iron Lady, the cutest little thing in the world.\u2019)\n\nMisha is in London to launch the project that she and Meghan had been secretly collaborating on since the beginning of the year, a clothes collection for the charity Smart Works, which helps women who\u2019ve suffered various knockbacks in life to secure employment.\n\nPart of the charity\u2019s work is dressing women for interviews and the workplace using donations or surplus stock from fashion brands. But when Meghan became patron, she was immediately struck that many of these outfits were not the style classics that can really boost a woman\u2019s confidence.\n\n\u2018What Meghan did was very clever. Smartworks had a lot of lilac blazers, which were lovely but weren\u2019t really what these ladies needed \u2013 they weren\u2019t the kind of staples to nail a job interview,\u2019 Misha says.\n\nSo Meghan persuaded John Lewis to design a tote bag, Jigsaw a trouser suit and Marks & Spencer a dress, while Misha came up with a version of her trademark white shirt \u2013 all capsule items that last for decades. For every item purchased, the brands donate an identical garment to the charity.\n\n\u2018It was very important for the Duchess, from the get-go, that this was about a one-for-one model rather than making a financial donation, because that makes us all feel equal,\u2019 Misha says. \u2018Meghan said, \u201cYou may not know these women but every time you wear that shirt, those trousers, that dress, you can know that you\u2019ve helped another woman.\u201d\u2019\n\nThe fact that Meghan chose Misha\u2019s eponymous US-based label (which ships to the UK via her website) alongside these British retail giants tells you everything about the strength of their bond, as does the fact she wore the \u00a3125 shirt that Misha designed to the collection\u2019s launch. \u2018I was really touched,\u2019 Misha beams.\n\nMeghan and Misha\u2019s collaboration involved weekly conference calls and occasional face-to-face meetings (\u2018The Duchess isn\u2019t a micro-manager, that\u2019s not her personality at all. She asked what I was going to do and then said, \u201cYou nail out the design details.\u201d\u2019). It was the natural culmination of the two friends\u2019 shared passion for women\u2019s rights, something they discovered when they first met at a lunch at the international art fair, Art Basel, in Miami five years ago. (\u2018And by \u201cmet\u201d, I mean danced the night away and sipped cocktails with,\u2019 Meghan wrote on The Tig).\n\nSince then, the friends have been there for each other during some profound life changes. When they met, both were married \u2013 Meghan to film producer Trevor Engelson, Misha to Alexander, whom she\u2019d wed in a lavish three-day event in Venice, with singer Lana Del Rey performing. But two years later, Meghan got divorced, while Misha and Alexander split in 2016 after four years of marriage (he\u2019s now dating tennis player Maria Sharapova).\n\nMisha with Mikey, who she wed last month, at Meghan and Harry\u2019s wedding\n\nBoth women are only children and it\u2019s clear their friendship sustained each other; one Instagram snap of the friends on holiday on the Spanish island of Formentera three years ago (it was on the London leg of the same holiday that the infamous blind date is thought to have happened) is captioned, \u2018When only children find sisters\u2019.\n\n\u2018I always said I wanted to have siblings but I have such incredible friendships that I no longer think so much about it,\u2019 says Misha. \u2018I\u2019m exceptionally lucky to have the support system that I have. I feel the relationships I make go very deep.\u2019\n\nImmediately after we met, Misha was flying to Rome for her wedding (on which a social-media ban was placed). She was giggling nervously about whether her self-designed dress would be ready in time. \u2018Creating it has been so challenging, because there are no limits to what you can do with a wedding dress, so at times the choice has been almost paralysing. But I think I\u2019m there now.\u2019\n\nAfter all, Misha\u2019s design philosophy is about cutting down on choice. Her clothes are mostly in black and white, with an occasional touch of red or grey. \u2018When you\u2019ve got a wedding and you can\u2019t wear black or white I really struggle,\u2019 she laughs. At Meghan\u2019s wedding she wore her own pale blue creation, wearing a red version to Princess Eugenie\u2019s nuptials.\n\nThe daughter of an Iraqi Jewish financier father and Newcastle-born English mother, Misha (the surname is pronounced noo-noo with equal stress on both syllables \u2013 \u2018everyone gets it wrong,\u2019 she laughs) spent her early years in Bahrain, where the sight of Muslim women everywhere shrouded in abayas made an indelible impression. \u2018I\u2019m sure my passion for empowering women comes from growing up seeing that a lot of women can\u2019t choose how they dress,\u2019 she says. \u2018And what\u2019s been amazing is my dad, who\u2019s 77, and a very traditional, old-school Middle Eastern man, has had to adjust to having a very progressive daughter. Now he really flies the flag for women\u2019s rights.\u2019\n\nWhen she was ten, the family relocated to Surrey where \u2018strong-willed, very independent\u2019 and fashion-crazy Misha attended an international school, providing her with a worldwide network of friends. After studying business in Paris, at 23 she moved to New York, to work for a small fashion business.\n\nEight years ago she started her own label, but trying to stay afloat in a cut-throat market brought \u2018some really soul-destroying moments\u2019. With her marriage also on the rocks, she admits to \u2018struggling\u2019 both personally and professionally.\n\nAt one of Misha\u2019s lowest points, she read Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s working-women\u2019s manifesto, Lean In, and with characteristic chutzpah, sent the Facebook chief operating officer a fan email. \u2018I never thought she\u2019d read it, but she replied within about four hours, inviting me to a monthly women\u2019s night at her home in San Francisco.\u2019\n\nMisha went along and also had a tour of Instagram HQ [Facebook had just acquired it], inspiring her to become the first designer to abandon traditional catwalk shows in favour of showing her collections on social media.\n\nSince then, she\u2019s had several more lightbulb moments, such as having all orders made on demand in China. \u2018It means we don\u2019t have any waste, which then either has to go to landfill or be burned,\u2019 she explains. \u2018The customer has to wait seven days for her order, but that feels plausible for clothes that are wardrobe staples, not just something you\u2019re buying to wear on Saturday night and then throw away.\u2019\n\nOf course, having your brand endorsed by one of the most famous women in the world (last year Meghan wore Misha\u2019s Saturday skirt to launch a cookbook raising funds for survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire) has given the business a boost no amount of advertising could buy. In return, her allegiance to Meghan is touching. \u2018She\u2019s a beautiful, gorgeous, stunning woman,\u2019 Misha says passionately. \u2018At the Smart Works launch, everyone was saying, \u201cGod, she\u2019s so lovely, she\u2019s so well spoken.\u201d To have someone like that championing British charities is extraordinary. Someone said, \u201cWe\u2019re so lucky to have her in the UK,\u201d and I was like, \u201cYeah!\u201d\u2019", "description": "The guest list at her recent wedding was more A-list than an Oscars after-party, the Duchess of Sussex calls her a 'chic badass' and she is rumoured to have set up Harry and Meghan on their blind date", "authors": ["Julia Llewellyn Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/17/19262886-0-image-a-113_1570121537889.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
