Sky offers a similar pledge. To beat the black spots, you use devices that plug into electric sockets around the home.\n\nThese disc-shaped objects pick up the wi-fi signal broadcast from your main router hub and amplify it to extend its reach.\n\n'I\u2019m tired of two teenage children taking over my bedroom to stream Stranger Things because the internet reception is too poor in their rooms,' says Toby Walne\n\nYou can get a similar effect using so-called powerline adapters. These send the internet signal through the electrical wiring in the home, rather than through the air as wi-fi.\n\nMy call to BT\u2019s sales number is immediately answered (why doesn\u2019t that ever happen when you\u2019re making a complaint?). \u2018It\u2019s your lucky day,\u2019 explains sales assistant Peter. Apparently the copper wires feeding my home are running at the sluggish speed of three megabits per second \u2013 just enough for standard definition streaming for one device.\n\nHe offers to boost the speed with \u2018superfast fibre\u2019. This actually just means connecting my copper wires to a green internet cabinet box a mile down the road, rather than full fibre into my property.\n\nThe new service boasts an average download speed of 36 megabits per second but all I seem to get when it goes live is 13 megabits per second. No matter \u2013 it\u2019s the \u2018wi-fi in every room\u2019 pledge I\u2019m really after. I\u2019m tired of two teenage children taking over my bedroom to stream Stranger Things because the internet reception is too poor in their rooms.\n\nPeter at BT tells me the total wi-fi experience is only guaranteed with its \u2018plus\u2019 package. This is usually \u00a363.99 a month but this month\u2019s \u2018special offer\u2019 price is \u00a344.99 a month.\n\nLater, looking online, I see a BT \u2018complete wi-fi\u2019 with booster discs deal for \u00a345.99 a month tied in for two years. I could have paid \u00a335.99 a month just for \u2018superfast fibre\u2019 without that much-coveted wi-fi guarantee \u2013 so the extra pledge costs \u00a310 a month.\n\nStill need help? Here are other ways to boost your domestic Wi-Fi signal\n\nMy deal provides a new hub and a \u2018wi-fi disc\u2019 to boost the signal (and includes landline rental). As the total is 50p less than I pay now for standard BT internet, it seems a no-brainer. The catch is I am tied in for 18 months and then face paying full price.\n\nA week later two parcels drop through the letterbox \u2013 a \u2018Smart 2\u2019 hub and separate wi-fi disc booster. The usual charge is \u00a39.99 postage but as part of my deal this extra charge is being waived. The next day I receive a text explaining engineer Rheiss will be connecting me. I ring to apologise that I will not be at home. But it turns out Rheiss is only fiddling with wires in the green box outside my village.\n\nMy old internet connection is cut off for that day, so the stakes are high when I return home to two waiting teenagers. Fortunately, the change is straightforward \u2013 simply a case of taking the wires out of the back of my old BT hub and sticking them into the new one. Then I tap the password of my new hub into the family\u2019s various computers and phones to connect to the internet.\n\nBut the much-heralded signal booster is a flop. Using a \u2018My BT\u2019 app on my mobile I start to wander around the house looking for a place to plug in the gadget. Sadly, I have walked barely 30 feet and the phone app shows the signal is already weak \u2013 blinking back \u2018poor location\u2019 \u2013 while up the stairs I am \u2018out of range\u2019.\n\nI call BT and after hanging on the line for 15 minutes they agree to pop another disc-shaped booster in the post. It arrives four days later. With two boosters now plugged in I can spread the initial signal to one disc that then passes the signal on again to an additional disc \u2013 creating a virtual daisy chain enabling the wi-fi signal to reach the far end of the house.\n\nBut the top rear bedroom still does not enjoy a full wi-fi signal. BT says it will provide a maximum of three boosters as part of the \u2018guarantee\u2019. If it still fails to fulfil the wi-fi pledge, it will offer a \u00a320 refund \u2013 and happily cancel the contract.\n\nSo I call a third time and this time for a third disc \u2013 and it does the trick. It has been a bit of a palaver but I have at last got the service that was promised. Though it does seem a bit rich to have to pay \u00a310 extra a month on top of the usual bill to get a level of internet service you might have expected to receive automatically in the first place.\n\nThe internet is a 21st century marvel \u2013 but it comes at a high price.", "description": "Life in rural Hertfordshire leaves me with a snail's pace internet speed - and almost half my home suffers from 'black spots' with no wi-fi reception.", "authors": ["Towalne For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
