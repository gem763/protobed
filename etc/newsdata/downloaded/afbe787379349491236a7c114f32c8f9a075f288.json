The community was electric, and Nintendo was regularly adding new content, keeping things fresh. (Did you know the game didn\u2019t originally have checkpoints?!) But nearly four months after the release of Super Mario Maker 2, months in which I\u2019ve been checking in on the game almost every day, I can feel the b word bubbling to the surface. I\u2019m getting bored.\n\n\u201cBored\u201d is not to suggest the community is at fault. As with the first game, Mario Maker 2\u2019s community has been nothing short of incredible, whether it\u2019s the invention of reverse trolls, levels that trick the player into seeing a first-person perspective, 20-second speedruns, and so much more. It\u2019s a good game! But Nintendo crafting a good game was never the question, and wasn\u2019t at the heart of my review from back in June. What I worried about, and what seems to be playing out, is how Nintendo could potentially mishandle the community.\n\nAlmost four months in, Mario Maker 2 has not seen a significant update, and there is zero indication of a roadmap from Nintendo about the game\u2019s future. There was a patch earlier this month, but it added barebone features like online co-op and local multiplayer with friends, stuff that should have been there from day one. You can also now play \u201cofficial\u201d courses Nintendo makes, such as their promotional tie-in with Southwest Airlines. Hooray?\n\nThe lack of new course pieces or themes is a bummer, and those will come in due time, I\u2019m sure. Still, it would be very useful if, at the very least, Nintendo released a schedule of what\u2019s coming, even with the details left in the air. If we knew additional course pieces were coming in \u201cearly 2020\u201d or a new theme in \u201cDecember,\u201d it\u2019d go a long way in maintaining interest, and recognizing Mario Maker 2 as a living document, a community to be nourished over time.\n\nRight now, all we have is a tweet saying we can \u201clook forward to additional game updates, including new course parts in the future.\u201d I mean, of course? But it\u2019s 2019, there are a million video games to play. Games like Mario Maker 2 require a vibrant community to stay successful, and communities require attention. It\u2019s not like the company can\u2019t pull this off, either. Smash Bros. designer Masahiro Sakurai is an open book, and Nintendo was always talking with its Splatoon 2 community, a game receiving regular updates, both big and small.\n\nWho\u2019s that person for Mario Maker, and where\u2019s that openness? Mario Maker 2 would greatly benefit from some kind of community lead, a person who became the point person.\n\nMore frustrating is how Mario Maker 2 still hasn\u2019t caught up with the original game in crucial ways. With Mario Maker, it was possible to share levels online through the excellent \u201cbookmark\u201d website. It would have made a lot of sense for Nintendo to simply carry that website over into Mario Maker 2, but they didn\u2019t. It would have made a lot of sense for Nintendo to let people share levels through their official app, ala Super Smash Bros. Ultimate custom stages, but you can\u2019t. This leaves people to share levels via level code alone, and sifting through Nintendo\u2019s algorithm (which admittedly is pretty decent, all told).\n\nWhen one of the best ways to find a cool level is to put the game on \u201crandom\u201d by playing Mario Maker 2\u2019s endless mode and hoping for the best, that\u2019s not a good sign. The game should be bending over backwards to find ways to connect you with the best it has to offer. Heck, if all Nintendo did was add playlists, it\u2019d go a long way towards solving these issues. Players would do it for them.\n\nIt's the little things, too. Mario Maker 2 ditched the \u201ccostume\u201d feature from the original game, which let you run around levels as anyone from Mewtwo to the frickin\u2019 Wii Balance Board from Wii Fit, in favor of a slate of characters from the Mario series. I remember having so much fun booting up Mario Maker and seeing what weirdness Nintendo had recently added. It was less about jumping around as Tom Nook insomuch as giving you a reason to poke around Mario Maker, and provided a tangible sense Nintendo was always paying attention.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t feel that way in Mario Maker 2 right now. There\u2019s time for it to change, obviously, but anecdotally, a lot of friends who were deeply invested in Mario Maker have already moved on. Hopefully they come back when Nintendo does, but when is that gonna be?\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter. If you know what's happening internally at Nintendo, drop an email: patrick.klepek@vice.com.
