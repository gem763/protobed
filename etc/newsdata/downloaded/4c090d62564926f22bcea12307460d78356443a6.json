America is among the most carnivorous nations on the planet, consuming an estimated 222 pounds of meat per person a year.\n\nLast month, the U.N. warned that high consumption of meat in the West is fueling global warming, and said switching to a plant-based diet would help fight climate change.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nSupporters of restricting meat consumption say it would drastically reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. The agricultural industry is responsible for 11 percent of global greenhouse emissions, mostly from livestock production. A large portion of that comes from methane created by cow burps, but things like manure, fertilizer, shipping and refrigeration of meat also create a significant amount of carbon. The need for grazing land also leads farmers to destroy large swaths of forest, reducing the plants from extracting carbon out of the air.\n\nCritics argue that eating less meat will have less impact relative to potential changes in other sectors, like the energy industry. Others argue that pushing a completely meat-free diet is unrealistic. Asking people to instead reduce how much meat they eat or replace beef in their diet with poultry can still have a substantial effect.\n\nThere's also some evidence that a zero meat diet may not reduce emissions as much as initially thought because vegetarians tend to replace the meat in their diet with other animal products like eggs and dairy.\n\nWhat\u2019s next:\n\nFor those who wish to decrease or completely eliminate the amount of meat they eat, a number of options have come onto the market recently to make the move easier. Plant-based burgers have exploded in popularity over the past year or so. Though they may not be much healthier than beef, the environmental impact of producing them is significantly lower.\n\nPerspectives\n\nSupporters\n\nGiving up meat is essential to curb climate change.\n\n\u201cWe have to eat less meat. There\u2019s no two ways around that unless we just decide to give up on climate change.\u201d \u2014 Jonathan Safran Foer, Slate\n\nIt\u2019s not necessary to completely eliminate meat to make an impact.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s suggesting you become a vegan or vegetarian (though that can be beneficial), but you can make a dramatic impact by beginning to scale back. Beef and lamb are associated with particularly high carbon emissions, so maybe begin your journey there.\u201d \u2014 Samantha Cassetty, NBC News\n\nPeople could be fed using less land if individuals cut down on eating meat.\n\n\u201cSome diets require more land and water and lead to higher emissions than others. For example, diets that are high in grains, nuts and vegetables have a lower carbon footprint than those that are high in meat and they lead to better health outcomes.\u201d \u2014 Jim Skea, co-chair of the working group which produced a U.N. report\n\nSmall decisions can make a big difference.\n\n\u201cDifferent foods have vastly different carbon footprints. Swap your steak for fish, for example, and you get an eight-fold reduction in emissions. And if you\u2019re game to switch that to beans or lentils your emissions drop to near zero. It really gets interesting when lots of us start making similar changes.\u201d \u2014 Andy Murdock, Vox\n\nGovernments can create incentives to promote non-meat farming.\n\n\u201cFarmers need incentives to tread lightly on the land they work, while manufactures, retailers and consumers need disincentives to make, sell and eat the highly processed foods that we know are good for no one\u2019s health.\u201d \u2014 Julian Baggini, The Guardian\n\nThe burden of meat reduction falls on wealthy countries.\n\n\u201c...in a world racked by malnutrition and hunger [eating less meat] can be only part of the answer to rising temperatures. But many people in high-income countries will need to make more ambitious cuts in the amount of meat, eggs and dairy products they consume.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Alex Kirby, Climate News Network", "description": "With the global population set to explode by 2050, some experts are saying that humans need to reduce the amount of meat they eat to save the planet.
