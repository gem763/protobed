As players on the team celebrated the new lead against their opponents by charging the stands of cheering fans, four players removed their jerseys to display a shirt underneath with the message, \"#EQUALPAY.\"\n\nThe referee assigned yellow cards and removed the four players \u2014 as per Vermont's athletic rules, which prevents players from wearing clothing that displays slogans \u2014 while the crowd chanted \"Equal pay!\u201d according to CNN.\n\n\"We were frustrated at the time because we felt like our actions were appropriate for the moment,\" co-captain Maggie Barlow, 17, told CNN, about the yellow cards. \"In the end, the most important thing is the message we're sending.\"\n\nThe scene was reminiscent of and inspired by the U.S. women's national soccer team (USWNT) and their fight to achieve equal pay.\n\n\u201cEqual pay! Equal pay!\u201d\n\n\n\nMembers of the US women\u2019s soccer team chant, demanding equal pay during their victory parade in New York City.https://t.co/zzXBncsI44 pic.twitter.com/3NwNUvVyZN \u2014 CNN (@CNN) July 10, 2019\n\nOn March 8, which was International Women's Day and just months before the Women's World Cup kicked off in June, all 28 members of the USWNT roster filed a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation. The lawsuit claims that the women's team, despite performing the same duties and outperforming the men's team, even at times earning more profit for the federation, were paid less.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that a top women's player could earn as little as 38 percent of what a male player makes.\n\nTo put it in perspective, $30 million in prize money was given to teams in the 2019 women\u2019s tournament, while in the 2018 men's World Cup, $400 million was allocated. The winning team in the women's World Cup received $4 million, while the 2018 male winners in France received $38 million.\n\nThe filing of the lawsuit was considered a bold move, due to the fact that the USWNT would, in just a few months, be playing to defend their world title.\n\nThe public fight for equal pay clearly resonated with fans, particularly students on Burlington High School's soccer team.\n\nThe Seahorses, partnering with Change The Story, an organization that aims to \"fast-track women's economic status in Vermont,\" created the \"#EQUAL PAY\" jerseys, which they are now selling for $25. Men are invited to pay 16 percent more, representing the wage gap, totaling $31. According to Change The Story member Jessica Nordhaus, many men have already taken the team up on that invitation.\n\nAlong with those men are members of the school's staff and student body, as well as the community and Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and his wife. The boy's soccer team has also taken to wearing the #EQUALPAY jerseys.\n\nAccording to CNN, the organization has received more than 1,000 orders for the jersey.\n\n\u201cWe are so proud of our Girl\u2019s soccer team,\u201d Noel Green, the principal of Burlington High School, said in a statement. \u201cThey have taken their learning beyond the classroom and have truly worked hard to learn more, educate others, and use their platform as varsity student-athletes to try to create change. The work ethic and community engagement shown over the past few weeks mirror the ideals that we hope to see in all of our students. Go, Seahorses, Go!\u201d\n\nTheir coach, Jeff Hayes, told CNN: \"I am so proud of this team on what they have done on and off the field.\u201d\n\nEven former USWNT player Brandi Chastain, an Olympic and World Cup winner, who scored the World Cup-winning penalty shootout against China in the 1999 tournament, sent a message of support to the high school team.", "description": "Four high school soccer players received a yellow card at their game on Friday for removing their jerseys to display a shirt underneath that read \"#EQUALPAY.\"", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vXJ7LeVDN3QXWPKH.NcATg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.abcnewsplus.com/ca7d5407f91da5ceaa27fedf791952a6", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
