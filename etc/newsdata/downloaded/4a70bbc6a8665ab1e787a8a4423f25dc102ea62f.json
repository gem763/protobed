Work with your CIO to deliver end-to-end, real-time CX", "language": "en", "text": "How to get stuff done when you\u2019re a busy CIO CIO Strategy: In an age of continuous digital transformation, CIOs must create coping strategies to ensure they can deliver on the expectations of the executive team.\n\nWe all understand the need for rich, responsive, personalized customer experience -- right? Well, not so fast! The data argue a different point, suggesting that many firms fail to deliver real-time CX.\n\nBased on Forrester's 2019 customer obsession data, 55% of enterprises are still either customer-na\u00efve or just customer-aware -- delivering beginner-level CX.

These beginners see their customers as reasonably static, with needs that can be periodically mapped but which don't require continuous attention.\n\nIgnore partners' involvement in CX, instead of driving ongoing partner engagement. They don't continuously define and deliver real-time, end-to-end experiences.\n\nIf you truly want to compete, work with your CIO to deliver real-time, end-to-end CX .

As economist Gary Hamel put it, the adaptive enterprise proactively demonstrates \". . . the capacity to reconfigure [the firm's] underlying business concept, by dramatically rethinking its core mission, its primary value proposition, its core competencies, the markets or industries in which it competes, [and] its end customer.\"\n\nLearn more about FeedbackNow, Forrester's real-time CX solution.\n\nThis post was written by Vice President, Principal Analyst Bobby Cameron, and originally appeared here.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The path to customer obsession doesn't get easier with time.
