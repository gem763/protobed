Jenelle Evans' former fiance has reportedly been arrested for a DUI in North Carolina. Nathan Griffin, 32, was taken in by police after he was driving while impaired outside a grocery store in Cary, North Carolina on Thursday\n\n'So supposedly there was a caller [who reported a] disturbance of a man sleeping behind [the wheel of] his car,' began Nathan's recounting of Thursday's events.\n\n'The fire [department] showed up... I said everything was fine. I was going ahead and meeting some friends, and so of course I locked my doors and I was walking down the street... and a good four or five minutes [later] I was pulled over by a police officer [who] told me to walk back to my vehicle.'\n\n'The could not get into my vehicle. They asked if I was sleeping and if the car was being operated. I said no.'\n\nTrouble: But the former marine claims he told police to 'arrest me for public intoxication' instead, as he was actually locked out of his vehicle at the time, in video obtained by TMZ. Griffith seen here with his former fiance Jenelle Evans\n\n'They gave me a sobriety test. I think they were highly subjective to whether I was passing.'\n\n'So anyways, they arrest me for DUI and I was like \"How are you arresting me for DUI if I wasn't even behind [the wheel of] a vehicle, operating a vehicle on a public access [road], and my vehicle wasn't even turned on?\"'\n\n'And they said \"We have witnesses saying you were sleeping behind your wheel when the vehicle was turned on.'\"\n\n'I said \"Obviously no because I can't even get in my vehicle.\"'\n\nThe father-of-one then claims to have told the arresting officers, \"The least you can do is arrest me for public intoxication.\"'\n\nHis ex: Together Nathan and Jenelle shared a son named Kaiser, aged five. They split in 2015\n\nThe Wake County Sheriff's Department told Radar Online that Griffith was arrested for DUI and then released on bond.\n\nThis comes just months after Jenelle was fired from Teen Mom 2 for the dog-killing scandal at her home.

And she has Ensley with husband David Eason, who has kids from another relationship as well\n\nBut then Eason was let off the hook when the Sheriff's Office and the Department of Social Service found no evidence of the dog being killed.\n\nIn July Jenelle and David regained custody of her children.\n\nTrouble in the air: Griffith has long history with the police and has been arrested multiple times\n\nGriffith has long history with the police.\n\nHe was handcuffed for DUI in North Myrtle Beach, North Carolina, in September 2013 for driving recklessly.

'It's shocking still but I respect their decision and have nothing but love for MTV.\n\n'This is a new chapter for me and my family,' she added. 'I will continue to try what's best for me and my family.'\n\nShe also said she is working on her marriage.\n\n'David has been here for me since the news broke, he told me to not worry about it and to stay positive,' she said.
