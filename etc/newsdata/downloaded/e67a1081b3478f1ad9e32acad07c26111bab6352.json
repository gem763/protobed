Thinking about tests can make your stomach ache or your heart pound. You may remember a previous exam that didn\u2019t go perfectly and worry, \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t remember the answers?\u201d or \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t do well?\u201d\n\nThe truth is that everyone feels a bit anxious before being tested, be it during a history exam, soccer tryout or musical performance. The key is managing those nerves. So here are several simple, effective tips from experts to help you control your emotions and do your best:\n\nTips on how to follow through on your goals\n\n1. Practice strategically. Having the information and skills you need to succeed is key to managing self-doubt and avoiding failure. So above all, study well ahead of time.\n\n\u201cPractice doing exactly what you\u2019ll have to do on the test,\u201d recommends Eileen Kennedy-Moore, a psychologist and author. For instance, explains Moore in her book \u201cKid Confidence,\u201d for a math exam, practice doing actual math problems, like those that you\u2019ll be tested on. Doing anything else, like reading through notes or watching your tutor solve problems, won\u2019t prepare you, Moore says. Sleep also helps your brain absorb and retain what you\u2019ve learned, so ideally, review before bedtime - perhaps asking a parent to help.\n\n2. Do the easy parts first. \u201cIf you hit a hard question, skip it and come back to it. Doing the easy ones first builds your momentum and confidence - and might remind you of things you\u2019ve forgotten,\u201d Moore says.\n\nTips for better concentration, from meditation to sports\n\n3. Block bad thoughts. \u201cPut your imagination on a leash,\u201d recommends Jane Ehrman, who\u2019s a behavioral health therapist at the Cleveland Clinic. \u201cDeleting\u201d negative self-talk by focusing on your knowledge and abilities, and picturing yourself doing well instead, can help you reach your goals, Ehrman says.\n\n4. Keep calm. This may sound impossible when you\u2019re really nervous, but like anything else, calming down is easy with the proper tools. Oxygen relaxes you and increases brain function, so as soon as you feel panic rising, try this breathe-and-release technique, suggests Ehrman: Take a long, deep breath, then part your lips and let it all go, exhaling all your tension and worries out of your body. Repeat for four breaths, three or four times a day. After a couple of weeks, deep breathing daily can \u201crewire\u201d your brain to be calmer. You\u2019ll find that when faced with new challenges, you\u2019ll automatically breathe-and-release any stress before it\u2019s overwhelming.\n\nSelf-care tips to look after your mental, physical and emotional health\n\n5. Take care. Practice healthy habits in general, but especially in the week leading up to a test, Ehrman says. This means getting exercise, going to bed early and fueling your body and brain with healthy food - not junk food - to be at your best.\n\n6. Stay focused. Because you can think about only one thing at a time, you can replace any negative thoughts with a positive statement, such as, \u201cI know how to do this!\u201d When you feel fear or doubt creeping up, take four long breaths while repeating your statement. In just a minute, you\u2019ll be calmer and ready to tackle what\u2019s ahead.\n\nAnd remember that if you feel overwhelmed or want help managing difficult emotions or challenges, always reach out to your family, friends, guidance counselors or others you trust. Having support can help make any difficult situation more bearable.", "description": "While it's natural for students to feel nervous about tests, we've got some expert advice on dealing with anxiety", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/educationalstress.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
