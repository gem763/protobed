Matt Gaetz kicked out of impeachment inquiry hearing", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., an ardent supporter of President Trump, got the boot on Monday when he tried to sit in on the testimony of a former top National Security Council expert on Russia who was appearing on Capitol Hill as part of the House impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nGaetz, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, attempted to attend the testimony of Fiona Hill, a former deputy assistant to the president, but was told that because he was not a member of the House Intelligence Committee that he had to leave. The House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees are conducting the impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nA frustrated Gaetz aired his disappointment to reporters after being told he was not allowed to sit in on the hearing, venting his anger over what he says are \u201cselective leaks\u201d by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and questioning why he was not allowed to be present during Hill\u2019s testimony. Gaetz added that the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., was involved in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m on agriculture,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cWhat are the Democrats so afraid of?\u201d\n\n\u2018WHERE\u2019S HUNTER?\u2019 TRUMP ASKS, AS BIDEN\u2019S SON PROMISES NOT TO WORK WITH FOREIGN COMPANIES IF FATHER WINS PRESIDENCY IN 2020\n\nGaetz followed up his comments with a tweet calling the impeachment inquiry a kangaroo court and using one of Trump\u2019s favorite nicknames for the intelligence committee chairman, \u201cShifty Schiff.\u201d\n\n\"Judiciary Chairman [Jerry Nadler] claimed to have begun the impeachment inquiry weeks ago,\u201d Gaetz tweeted. \u201cNow, his own Judiciary members aren\u2019t even allowed to participate in it. And yes - my constituents want me actively involved in stopping the #KangarooCourtCoup run by Shifty Schiff.\"\n\nOther Republicans closely aligned with Trump continued on Monday to complain about Schiff and his handling of the impeachment inquiry \u2013 with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, also lambasting the California Democrat for excluding some congressional Republicans from the testimonies and for leaking \u201ccherry-picked\u201d information from the closed-door hearings to the press.\n\n\u201cShe was going to come voluntarily but he's going to subpoena her I believe so he can ask certain questions and again keep those secret except for the certain things that he wants to leak, the cherry-picked information to the American people,\u201d Jordan said of Schiff before Hill\u2019s testimony.\n\nTRUMP SAYS OBAMA 'HIDING' FROM QUESTIONS ABOUT BIDENS AND UKRAINE: 'I THINK HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT'\n\nLee Wolosky, Hill\u2019s attorney, tweeted on Monday that the former deputy assistant to the president had received a congressional subpoena.\n\n\u201cThe tragedy here and the crime here is that the American people don't get to see what's going on in these sessions,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nHill\u2019s testimony comes ahead of a planned Thursday appearance by Gordon Sondland, Trump's hand-picked ambassador to the European Union, and follows the revelation of a cache of text messages from top envoys that provide a vivid account of their work acting as intermediaries around the time Trump urged Ukraine's new president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, to start investigations into a company linked to the family of a chief Democratic presidential rival, Joe Biden.\n\nSondland is set to tell lawmakers that he did understand the administration was offering Zelenskiy a White House visit in exchange for a public statement committing to investigations Trump wanted, according to the person, who demanded anonymity to discuss remarks not yet given.\n\nBut Sondland will say he did not know the company being talked about for an investigation, Burisma, was tied to Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, the person said. Sondland understood the discussions about combating corruption to be part of a much broader and publicized Trump administration push that was widely shared, the person said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOne witness who may not be called before Congress is the still anonymous government whistleblower who touched off the impeachment inquiry. Top Democrats say testimony and evidence coming in from other witnesses, and even the president himself, are backing up the whistleblower's account of what transpired during Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy.\n\nLawmakers have also grown deeply concerned about protecting the person from Trump's threats over the matter and may not wish to risk exposing the whistleblower's identity.\n\nSchiff said Sunday, \"We don't need the whistleblower, who wasn't on the call, to tell us what took place during the call. We have the best evidence of that.\" He added it \"may not be necessary\" to reveal the whistleblower's identity as the House gathers evidence.\n\n\"Our primary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected,\" Schiff said.\n\nFox News\u2019 Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Rep.
