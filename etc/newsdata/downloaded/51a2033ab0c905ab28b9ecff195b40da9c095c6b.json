Similarly rated first-lien loans have cleared the market at an average price of 98.32 so far in October, according to the data.\n\nA representative for Deutsche Bank declined to comment.\n\nTough sell\n\nDeutsche\u2019s struggle was relatively short-lived compared to some other cases where lenders have been left on the hook. Banks involved in at least two other recent struggling buyout financings agreed not to offer the debt to investors below a threshold of 95 cents on the dollar and are still stuck with it.\n\nYet several tweaks to Monotype\u2019s structure, covenants and pricing were needed to get the deal over the line.\n\nThe size of the first-lien loan was cut to $425 million from $440 million and pricing was sweetened three times. Deutsche ultimately sold the debt with a spread of 5.5 percentage points over the Libor benchmark.\n\n--With assistance from Lara Wieczezynski.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Davide Scigliuzzo in New York at dscigliuzzo2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Natalie Harrison at nharrison73@bloomberg.net, Nikolaj Gammeltoft\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A group of lenders led by Deutsche Bank Group AG has managed to offload a $425 million loan for the buyout of type-font designer Monotype Imaging Holdings Inc. after laboring for weeks to find buyers, according to people familiar with the matter.The debt is among the more than $2 billion", "authors": ["Davide Scigliuzzo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
