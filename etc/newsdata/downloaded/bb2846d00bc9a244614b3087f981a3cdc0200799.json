Last week, he vowed to annex the Jordan Valley, which he framed as a means of establishing a permanent secure border for Israel.\n\nUnderpinning his pitch: Many Israelis say they have rarely, if ever, felt safer than they have during Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s last decade in power. A wave of suicide bombings and street stabbings, known as the second Palestinian intifada, had largely subsided when Mr. Netanyahu took office in 2009. The violence has generally been kept at bay, though Israel and Gaza have fought three wars since then.\n\n\u201cSecurity is his strong suit,\u201d said Shalom Lipner, who worked for several Israeli prime ministers including Mr. Netanyahu and is now with the nonpartisan Atlantic Council. \u201cHis luck may have run out now, but that\u2019s what kept him ticking along.\u201d\n\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s party, Likud, is running neck and neck in opinion polls with Blue and White, a new centrist party led by three former heads of the Israeli military. Blue and White\u2019s leader, Benny Gantz, has sought to neutralize Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s advantage on security matters and point to voter fatigue with the country\u2019s longest-serving premier.\n\nRetired Israeli Gen.

Hamas has periodically launched missiles into Israel for more than a year, often prompting Israeli airstrikes.\n\nMr. Gantz, a former general, says a dramatic military operation could be necessary to uproot Hamas once and for all. The former Israeli army chief of staff says Mr. Netanyahu has gone soft, essentially buying Hamas off by allowing Qatar to send tens of millions of dollars into Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe will not accept any violation of our sovereignty. Not a missile, not a kite, not a rocket. We will re-establish deterrence,\u201d Mr. Gantz said Tuesday at an event in northern Israel.\n\nThe threat from Hamas was underlined last week when Mr. Netanyahu was forced to exit a campaign event and seek refuge in a bomb shelter in Ashdod after Gaza militants fired rockets toward the seaside city.\n\nMr. Gantz and the other Blue and White ex-generals, Moshe Ya\u2019alon and Gabi Ashkenazi, used similar arguments against Mr. Netanyahu in a failed election bid in April. They got another shot with the help of another security-minded politician, former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who defected from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s camp and forced another election.\n\nMr. Lieberman\u2019s motivation was to force out of power religious parties that are allied with Mr. Netanyahu, but he, too, has slammed the prime minister\u2019s security record.\n\nIsraeli soldiers deployed in the Hula Valley north of Israel near the Israeli-Lebanon border.

He says he has taken a measured approach with Hamas, repeatedly launching strikes on Gaza and preparing for a fourth war with the group while working to prolong a fragile calm since 2014.\n\nMr. Netanyahu said Friday that Israel could launch an operation in Gaza \u201cat any moment, including four days before the elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsraeli citizens know well that I operate responsibly and with consideration and we\u2019ll start an operation when the moment is most right,\u201d he told Kan, Israel\u2019s public broadcaster.\n\nAnalysts say Mr. Netanyahu is trying to burnish his security credentials not only to thwart Mr. Gantz, a centrist, but also to prevent voters from choosing parties to the right of Likud.\n\nRight-wing voters see Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s security record as a strength. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an image. It is his record,\u201d said Jason Pearlman, a former aide to several right-wing politicians and now an independent consultant. He noted Mr. Gantz headed the army during the last war in Gaza while Mr. Netanyahu was in power and \u201cdoesn\u2019t have much to offer as an alternative.\u201d\n\nThe broadsides from Blue and White and other parties to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right have helped make his position more tenuous with voters, who rank security as the most important issue in the election. While Mr. Netanyahu faces a hearing for possible corruption charges in October, security issues have been central in this do-over election.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How would you judge Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s record on national security? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe leader has filled his schedule with security-focused events. He traveled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin on Thursday to discuss avoiding accidents as Israel steps up its military activities in the Mideast. Last week, he made a last-minute visit to London to discuss Iran with U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper.\n\nHe described his pledge to annex the Jordan Valley earlier this week as an effort to give Israel a permanent secure Eastern border. It was widely viewed as an 11th-hour bid to draw right-wing voters, though outside Israel it drew rebukes from the Arab world and even Russia.\n\nMr. Netanyahu flies in an Israeli military helicopter over the Jordan Valley between the Israeli city of Beit Shean and the West Bank city of Jericho.

Uzi Arad, a former national security adviser to Mr. Netanyahu who is now critical of him, said the premier hasn\u2019t acted decisively to confront security challenges.\n\n\u201cThis is an attitude that is clearly not in character with the tough hard-nosed Netanyahu that would never negotiate with terrorists or deal with Hamas,\u201d Mr. Arad said. \u201cThe ultimate is the results, and in the results, he\u2019s also failed to act and lost certain battles.\u201d\n\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s efforts to confront Iran have won him widespread support. But that record also faced a setback after Mr. Trump fired national security adviser John Bolton, who favored a tough line on Iran.\n\nMr. Netanyahu says he is working closely with the Trump administration, saying in a radio interview that voters must decide: \u201cWho will manage the negotiations and contacts with Trump on [Iran]?\u201d\n\n\u2014Dov Lieber contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com", "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is staking his political survival in Tuesday\u2019s election on his record in protecting Israel, as he faces a challenge from former generals who seek to sow doubt that he can keep the country safe.", "authors": ["Felicia Schwartz", "Felicia.Schwartz Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107190/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
