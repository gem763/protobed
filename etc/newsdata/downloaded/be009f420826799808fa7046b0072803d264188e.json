The loss dropped them two games behind the Rays for the second wild-card slot - the three playoff contenders each have three games left.\n\nTyler Glasnow (6-1, 1.92 ERA) is expected to start for Tampa Bay at Toronto. He\u2019s pitched a total of eight innings in three starts since missing most of the season with forearm trouble.\n\nMike Fiers (15-4, 3.91) is ready to pitch for the Athletics as they continue their series at Seattle.\n\nZach Plesac (8-6, 3.82) is set to start for the Indians when they visit playoff-bound Washington in an interleague matchup.\n\nSOMETHING BREWIN\u2019\n\nSparkplug rookie Keston Hiura and the Brewers take a seven-game winning streak into Coors Field. Milwaukee has already clinched a playoff spot - it trails St. Louis by one game in the NL Central, and is one game behind Washington for the top wild-card spot.\n\nDespite losing reigning NL MVP Christian Yelich to a broken kneecap, the Brewers have won 18 of 20 and have the best September record in the majors at 20-4. Milwaukee concludes with three games at Colorado against the team it swept in the playoffs last year before losing to the Dodgers in the NL Championship Series.\n\nZach Davies (10-7, 3.61 ERA) starts the opener for the Brewers.\n\nIN THE CARDS\n\nSt. Louis leads the NL Central by one game over Milwaukee - the Cardinals are home this weekend against the Cubs.\n\nRookie right-hander Dakota Hudson (16-7, 3.45 ERA) starts the opener for St. Louis. He faced the Cubs last weekend and had trouble, walking four straight batters in the first inning and getting pulled after the third. The Cardinals overcame his wildness and wound up with a four-game sweep at Wrigley Field.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors Friday:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/athletics_mariners_baseball_73312_c0-183-4382-2737_s1770x1032.jpg?170ff4ce8e5dc00945d4d782cfbfc2878e0267f4", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
