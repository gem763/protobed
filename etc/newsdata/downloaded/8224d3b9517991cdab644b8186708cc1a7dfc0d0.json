But now visitors will see works from different eras, places and mediums displayed side by side.\n\nAlthough the galleries are still ordered according to loose time periods, and some rooms follow a particular theme such as action painting, there is far greater scope for placing works alongside one another that would not ordinarily be seen together.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A MoMA gallery during a press preview on 10 October.

It reframes Picasso differently. It doesn\u2019t diminish Picasso, it simply means that there\u2019s another conversation you can have around Picasso.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThroughout the building we have tried to identify moments where unexpected relationships suddenly change the way we see something \u2026 You can take works of art that are roughly contemporaneous but from different parts of the world and they spark conversations with each other that are unexpected.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A member of the media looks at the work of Rivane Neuenschwander titled Work of Days during a press preview on 10 October.

There\u2019s a kind of seamlessness to the way we absorb both images in the virtual world and images in the physical world. And so I think part of what we wanted to do was to clearly recognise that our audiences, not just our younger audiences, all of our audiences, are experiencing imagery in new and different ways.\u201d\n\nThere is greater diversity among the artists behind the works, which will be on regular rotation so that every six months a third of the works will be different.\n\nThe museum said that works by women have increased fivefold since the early 2000s, although 59% of artists across their collection are still male, with 28% female and 13% are people who are not gender-specific or are not single entities but groups, collectives and companies. They have also increased works from outside North America and Europe.\n\nLowry said: \u201cIn the last 20 years we\u2019ve made a very big push to ensure that representation of women, of African Americans and of course artists from elsewhere in the world was even more robust than before.\u201d\n\nThe museum has also tried to make itself more approachable to people outside of the art world by avoiding art-specific terminology in their signs.\n\nAmong the opening works on display are Rainforest V (Variation 1) by David Tudor and Composers Inside Electronics, an installation in the new studio, Richard Serra\u2019s Equal and a new site-specific work by Yoko Ono, Peace is Power.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A woman walks past Campbell\u2019s Soup Cans by Andy Warhol during a press preview on 10 October.

For my studio especially because we were involved in two amazing projects in New York and both iconic and they couldn\u2019t be more different from each other.\u201d", "description": "Museum of Modern Art will reopen with an additional 47,000 sq ft of space and famous works alongside lesser-known artists", "authors": ["Miranda Bryant"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f026cf9111ca63abd5a8b94924efeeb2d559e47/30_102_1930_1158/master/1930.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e267424e50ff7b21a34fff02998ee03b", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
