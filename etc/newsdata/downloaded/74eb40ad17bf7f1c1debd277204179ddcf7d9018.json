In addition, the chip will be able to connect to Azure Sphere security cloud services.\n\nSee also: Qualcomm intros new reference design for 5G FWA home gateways\n\n\"The solution adds to Qualcomm Technologies' robust hardware-based security to make it easy for manufacturers to create secure solutions, and to keep devices up to date over time with over a decade of security and OS updates created and delivered directly to each device by Microsoft,\" the companies added.\n\nGalen Hunt, managing director of Microsoft Azure Sphere said, \"the new IoT chipset will light up a broad set of new scenarios at the outer edge -- even the most resource-constrained ones.\"\n\nThe Qualcomm LTE 9205 modem also comes with the Azure IoT SDK. Sones says that developers are a finite resource, and \"the more we can invest and make developers productive, the better.\"\n\n\"Microsoft has a deep history with working with developer ecosystem and community,\" the executive said. \"We are focused on making that community as productive as possible.\"\n\nCNET: Qualcomm-FTC lawsuit: Everything you need to know\n\nPreviously, Microsoft had included the Qualcomm Vision Intelligence 300 Platform into the Vision AI Developer Kit for Azure IoT solutions.\n\nIn related news this week, Qualcomm has released a new reference design for integrating 5G and Wi-Fi 6 for Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) home gateways.\n\nDisclaimer: The trip to the Qualcomm 5G Summit was sponsored by Qualcomm.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
