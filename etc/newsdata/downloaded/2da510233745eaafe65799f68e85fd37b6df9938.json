And it\u2019s a monumentally bad idea to hint that we might have,\u201d added Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear weapons expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, California.\n\nBut perhaps the most damning response came from Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, Iran\u2019s information and communications technology minister, who posted a selfie standing in front of the Nahid-1 satellite, speculated to have been the cause of the blast among analysts, who also feared the testing could be a cover for the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nHis post appeared to indicate the device was still intact and the rumours entirely unfounded.\n\nMr Jahromi has a track record of deriding President Trump - who remains at odds with Tehran after backing out of a key nuclear accord last year - previously mocking his poorly attended inauguration ceremony of January 2017 by comparing crowd sizes unfavourably to a gathering honouring the 40th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution.\n\nPresident Trump recently expressed optimism at the G7 summit in Biarritz about his chances of sitting down with Hassan Rouhani to resolve outstanding tensions, only for his Iranian counterpart to say any such meeting would amount to little more than an empty photo opportunity if the US did not first lift its damaging sanctions against the regime.", "description": "Donald Trump has found himself trolled on Twitter by a top Iranian\u00a0official after he controversially tweeted a classified photograph taken by a US surveillance satellite.", "authors": ["Joe Sommerlad"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/01/16/iran-tweet.jpg"}
