That, said Facebook, would be a violation of state and federal civil statutes, not to mention WhatsApp's terms of service.\n\nFacebook filed the suit in a U.S. district court in San Francisco.\n\nNSO Group did not immediately respond for comment.\n\nWhatsApp released a blog post explaining the reason for the lawsuit on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe chat app noted it had worked with the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab \u2014 a research group devoted to protecting civil society from nation-backed hackers \u2014 to investigate a major abuse of the platform discovered in May 2019.\n\nThe blog post and court documents allege NSO set up phony WhatsApp servers to breach phones in a way that did not require users to answer NSO's calls.\n\nAt least 100 victims appear to have come from civil society, which WhatsApp calls \"an unmistakable pattern of abuse.\"\n\nAccording to John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at Citizen Lab, victims included (among others):\n\nProminent religious figures from multiple religions.\n\nWell-known journalists and TV personalities.\n\nLawyers working on human rights.\n\n\n\nWhat they're saying: \u201cIn the strongest possible terms, we dispute today\u2019s allegations and will vigorously fight them,\" NSO said in a statement. \"The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime. ... It has helped to save thousands of lives over recent years.\"\n\nRead the lawsuit here:\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated with comment from NSO Group.", "description": "Facebook alleges NSO tried to hack 1,400 cell phones and mobile devices over WhatsApp.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/5nMkmSig1LXp6MLFa-h3s4laYc0=/0x83:5424x3134/1920x1080/2019/10/29/1572379364188.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
