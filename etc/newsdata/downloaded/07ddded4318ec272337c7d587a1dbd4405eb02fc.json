Then the New Yorker published Farrow\u2019s investigative piece about the now disgraced Hollywood mogul and his alleged serial sex abuse of women, including rape.\n\nAnd now in Farrow\u2019s book a much darker picture of NBC and its mistreatment of women is emerging, including from a woman who said she was raped by former NBC anchor Matt Lauer, who was fired by the company for sexual misconduct in 2017.\n\n4. NBC News President Noah Oppenheim just sent this long email to NBC News staffers in advance of @RonanFarrow\u2019s book which comes out tomorrow pic.twitter.com/i62JjZlDit \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 14, 2019\n\nNBC News President Noah Oppenheim sent a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter to staff that New York magazine reporter Bashar Ali tweeted out:\n\nMatt Lauer\u2019s actions were abhorrent, and the anger and sadness he caused continue to this day. Ronan Farrow\u2019s book takes that undeniable fact and twists it into a lie \u2014 alleging we were a \u201ccompany with a lot of secrets.\u201d We have no secrets and nothing to hide. Now that we\u2019ve read Farrow\u2019s book, it\u2019s clear \u2014 his smear rests on the allegation that NBC\u2019s management knew about and took steps to hide Matt Lauer\u2019s misconduct before his firing in November of 2017. Without that, he has no basis on which to rest his second conspiracy theory \u2014 that Harvey Weinstein reporting was squashed to protect Lauer.\n\nThe letter includes an analysis of the book by NBC\u2019s \u201clegal team\u201d in an attempt to discredit the book.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s built on a series of distortions, confused timelines, and outright inaccuracies,\u201d Oppenheim wrote.\n\nBut Farrow pushed back in media interviews, including with CBS on Monday.\n\nPulitzer-Prize winning investigative reporter @RonanFarrow is here with us to break down his bombshell new book #CatchAndKill: pic.twitter.com/nmcGC8Y7ha \u2014 CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) October 14, 2019\n\n\u201cThis book is an extraordinarily, meticulously fact-checked work of investigative journalism,\u201d Farrow said. \u201cIt\u2019s two years of reporting. One of the senior fact checkers at the New Yorker checked it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let the reporting and the book stand on its own,\u201d Farrow said. \u201cWe\u2019re very confident in it and it\u2019s been amazing to see how the press have rallied around it. I think people have seen it for what it is.\u201d\n\nFarrow also said that NBC had an \u201cenhanced severance\u201d protocol.\n\n\u201cThese were explicitly arrangements to shut up women with allegations of misconduct at this company,\u201d Farrow said in the CBS interview.\n\nFarrow also said he as amazed at the \u201coutpouring of support from journalists at this company,\u201d referring to NBC.\n\nIn an interview with National Public Radio (NPR), Farrow discussed Brooke Nevils, the Lauer accuser who spoke publicly for the first time in the book:\n\nIn Brooke Nevils\u2019 case, this was a very powerful person at a company that she worked at who she had to have professional encounters with. And she describes instances where she was desperately trying to stop this and tortured by it and would have to come to him for professional reasons. And he would, by her telling \u2013 and he denies this \u2013 demand sex acts in his office when she was just trying to do her job. So yes, there\u2019s a complicated mix of contact afterwards where she was \u2013 readily concedes that there were communications where she was trying to not make him angry, where she feared for her career, where she was trying to make it OK in her own narrative to herself and stay cheerful about it \u2013 but that this was never something she described as an affair. This was a painful, agonizing process, even in those encounters after the alleged assault.\n\nFarrow told NPR that Lauer was just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m referring to a wider pattern that is about executives at the company, others at the company and, indeed, in several cases \u2026 with women who had complaints, including serious ones, about Matt Lauer years prior to his firing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I personally spoke to executives who were told about the problem,\u201d Farrow said.\n\nFarrow also called out Oppenheim in the book about his \u201canti-feminist\u201d writings from when he was a student at Harvard.\n\nWeekend Edition Sunday host Lulu Garcia-Navarro said:\n\nI want to talk a little bit about Noah Oppenheim. In the book, you uncover some anti-feminist writing from his days at The Harvard Crimson. One read, apparently, women enjoy being confined, pumped full of alcohol and preyed upon. They feel desired, not demeaned \u2013 talking about women going to frat parties. Why is that relevant?\n\nFarrow said:\n\nYou know, I go to pains to say Noah Oppenheim was young when he wrote that, that people grow and change. In the context of the book, it becomes relevant because this is someone who is making very similar arguments in the present day as a rationale for shutting down this story, saying, you know, this is simply not news. This does not matter.\n\nThe \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter on Twitter cuts off before Oppenheim lists what he wrote are \u201cegregious examples\u201d of inaccuracies in the book.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "NBC News is on the defense ahead of the release on Tuesday of Rowan Farrow\u2019s book that includes claims of company-wide sex abuse.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Ronan-Farrow-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
