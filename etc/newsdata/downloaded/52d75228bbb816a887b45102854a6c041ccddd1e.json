The 'house of horrors' in Birmingham is being sold at auction next month by SDL Bigwood Auctions\n\nFrom the outside, it looks like any other ordinary terrace house in the street called Douglas Road - albeit a little tired.\n\nThere is a trimmed hedge, a bay window and a gable porch - and even a lucky horseshoe above the front door.\n\nBut step inside and it is anything but typical of the other properties in the same road. The house, which is being sold at auction, also comes with plaster that's fallen off the walls, heaps of other rubble, and a kitchen to make your 'blood run cold'.\n\nThe three-bedroom property requires an extensive refurbishment throughout\n\nSDL Auctions, the estate agent handling the sale, explained: 'Appropriately due to be sold a few days before Halloween, this is a house of horrors that has plenty of cobwebs to be cleared away - plus a whole lot more besides.'\n\nIt went on to say that the property's 'hair-raising condition' is reflected in the asking price, which is 'no trick' having been set at \u00a31.\n\nThat said, the property is due to be sold at auction, where properties often sell for significantly more than the initial asking price. The auction is scheduled to take place at Villa Park, in Birmingham, on Tuesday October 29.\n\nThe average value of a property in Birmingham's Douglas Road is \u00a3186,292 compared to the \u00a3301,133 average for the country as a whole, according to property website Zoopla.\n\nFrom a different era: The kitchen reveals an extremely dated interior and a fireplace\n\nNeal Hume, a valuer at SDL Auctions Bigwood, said: 'This property may be a ghost of its former self but any serious investor will have the vision to see beyond the disrepair and image the possibilities.\n\nIt's actually a really lovely house with some attractive features such as original fireplaces and picture rails Neil Hume, auction valuer\n\n'It's actually a really lovely house with some attractive features such as original fireplaces and picture rails.'\n\nThe ground floor has a hallway and a kitchen, plus two receptions rooms, both with impressive fireplaces.\n\nThe fireplaces appear to be later additions installed in the 1930s, suggested the agent.\n\nUpstairs, there are three bedrooms - two with original cast iron fireplaces - and a bathroom. And outside there is a small yard at the front and a good sized garden at the rear, which perhaps appears smaller than it is, as it is so overgrown.\n\nThere are heaps of rubble in most of the rooms so a good clean is required before any redecorating can take place\n\nLook up and see the sky! There are plenty of holes in the roof that need to be fixed\n\nDouglas Road is within walking distance of a range of shops and amenities, including Acocks Green railway station, which runs three trains an hour to Birmingham.\n\nIt is six miles from the city centre and the same distance in the other direction to Birmingham International Airport.\n\nBuying agent Henry Pryor said: 'At least the stamp duty won't be a problem. The eventual purchase price is going to be more than the auctioneer's clever reserve of course, but the real costs only start there. This house may need a six figure sum spending on it to make it habitable again - new roof, most floors, plaster, kitchen, bathroom and that's just what you can see.\n\n'A building survey could throw up dry or wet rot, damp as well as structural issues. Gosh, I pity the neighbours.\n\n'Unmortgageable in it's current state, this property will take imagination and bottle. The contingencies in the event that you run into some unexpected problem will need to be substantial, but there is life in the old place and it could be someone's home in six months' time and looking at neighbouring properties it might then be worth as much as \u00a3200,000.\n\n'If you fancy yourself as a future Nick Knowles and want your own DIY SOS project, then you may have struck gold.'\n\nThis reception room has a large bay window that could become a stunning feature once renovated\n\nThe garden at the rear of the property perhaps looks smaller than it is as it is totally overgrown\n\nEach of the three bedrooms have an impressive fireplace that could be restored to their former glory", "description": "This three-bedroom property is completely derelict and is being sold at auction via SDL Bigwood Auctions next month, but buyers will need a big budget to make it liveable.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/23/14/18826280-0-image-a-15_1569245064842.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
