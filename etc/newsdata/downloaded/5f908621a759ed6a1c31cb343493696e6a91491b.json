In fact, all it takes is a coverage gap within two years for the chance of bankruptcy to jump twofold, according to the study published by the American Bankruptcy Institute.\n\nMany insurance plans are connected to an individual\u2019s employment or that of his/her spouse. Plus, a health limitation can create employment instability.\n\nThe researchers analyzed Bureau of Labor Statistics data of more than 12,500 people. It They found a \u201cstrong association\u201d between coverage interruptions and consumer bankruptcies. That link held true, even when controlling for variables like earnings and debt-to-income ratio. From 2008 to 2014, 454 people in that sample declared bankruptcy.\n\nDivorce, health problems and lower incomes were usually factors at play when someone experienced interrupted health coverage, the study said. Many insurance plans are connected to an individual\u2019s employment or that of his/her spouse. Plus, a health limitation can create employment instability, it added.\n\nThere\u2019s already a \u201cwell established connection\u201d between outstanding medical bills and consumer bankruptcies, the authors said, but there\u2019s less consensus on what counts as medical debt and how many bankruptcy cases are filed because of those unmanageable health costs.\n\nSuch studies typically show correlation and not causation. In this case, it could be that people who lack health insurance are not employed and/or are too poor to pay the lawyers and legal fees, the researchers suggested.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: 4 red lines to avoid financial disaster, according to a New York bankruptcy judge\n\nMedical costs are a widespread worry for many Americans.

He suggested investing more money into the Affordable Care Act, an Obama-era health law that aims to ensure fewer people go without health insurance.\n\nLast month, Fifth Circuit judges heard arguments on whether to strike down the ACA after lawmakers repealed the penalty against individuals who didn\u2019t have health insurance. Approximately 20 million people could lose their coverage if the law is ruled unconstitutional, according to advocates pushing to keep the law intact.\n\nThe Justice Department argues the lower court ruling should be upheld.\n\nSee also: 1 in 4 cancer survivors is going broke fighting to stay alive\n\nPrevious research has estimated that more than two in every three bankruptcies are spurred by medical issues, whether because of mounting bills, lost income from an illness or a combination of the two.\n\nLike Sousa, Brook Gotberg, the other author on the latest study, and an associate professor at the University of Missouri Law School, said the study underscored the importance of health insurance. \u201dThere\u2019s general consensus if somebody has a horrible, unforeseen unmitigated medical emergency, that\u2019s shouldn\u2019t destroy their lives.\u201d\n\nThere was a 5% monthly increase in total bankruptcy filings in July 2019, the American Bankruptcy Institute announced in a separate report released Monday.

And there were roughly 1,000 more consumer bankruptcies by July, compared to the same period last year.\n\nAlabama had the highest per capita rate, with 5.61 filings per 1,000 people, followed by Tennessee (5.39), Georgia (4.31), Mississippi (4.25) and Nevada (3.79).
