They also corrected his pronunciation: pasty rhymes with \"nasty,\" not \"tasty.\"\n\nTo set things straight, we turned to Dr. Andrew Pocock, the British High Commissioner to Canada at the time. It was a delicious and memorable conversation, that first aired in January, 2012.\n\nClick 'listen' above to hear the interview.", "description": "Michael found himself in a spot of bother seven years ago when he betrayed his ignorance of Cornish pasties \u2014 what they are, what\u2019s inside them and how to pronounce them (they rhyme with \u201cnasty,\u201d not \u201ctasty\u201d).
