Google's CEO does the same for the entire company.\n\nOKRs are the first step in Google's performance-management process, which hasn't changed since Laszlo Bock published a book about it in 2015, the company told Business Insider.\n\nIn his book \"Work Rules!,\" the former senior vice president of people operations at Google summarized the performance-management process with a few key components.\n\nMeasuring performance\n\nGooglers are rated by their managers on a five-point scale, from \"needs improvement\" to \"superb.\"\n\nSoliciting peer feedback\n\nGooglers and their managers select a group of peer reviewers that also includes employees who are junior to them.\n\nThe peer reviewers are asked to list one thing the person they're reviewing should do more of and one thing the employee could do differently to have a greater influence on the company.\n\nCalibrating\n\nGroups of managers meet and review all their employees' tentative ratings together. This process is designed to reduce managers' bias because they have to explain their decisions to each other.\n\nAmazon\n\nAt the start of the meeting, managers are given a handout that lists biases, such as the recency effect, which refers to the tendency to disproportionately value an employees' latest behaviors.\n\nKeeping those cognitive stumbling blocks in mind, they decide on employees' final ratings.\n\nSeparating annual reviews and pay discussions\n\nAt Google, annual reviews take place in November and pay discussions happen about a month later.\n\nThe hope is that employees want to improve for the sake of contributing more to the company \u2014 not because they're motivated by the prospect of a higher salary.\n\nUltimately, Bock says employees want to be evaluated because they want to grow and eventually become the best at their job. It's up to the employer to show them how to do that.", "description": "At Google, even people below you on the hierarchy review your performance.
