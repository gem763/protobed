I find that a gap-down opening on Friday will result in the repetition of October 1st, 2019 on October 25th, while Nifty 50 looks ready to test the lows of 11,251 after witnessing heavy sell-off; as it witnessed in most of the sectors on October 24th, 2019.\n\nBank stocks hammered the most, with the PSU Bank index, which tracks the country's state-owned lenders, tumbling as much as 5.85%. Shares of Indian Bank fell over 13%, while State Bank of India (NS: ) slipped 4.7%. On the other hand, Telecom tower infrastructures provider Bharti Infratel (NS: ) Ltd slid over 8% and was the top percentage loser on the NSE index. Let\u2019s have a look at the sell-off seen in different sectors of the Indian equity market on October 24th, 2019; which is likely to continue on October 25th, 2019 too.\n\nNifty - Sectoral Indices\n\nNo doubt that heavy weight Infosys (NS: ) looks ready to see steeper downward move ahead as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Securities and Exchange Board of India have started a probe into the whistleblower complaints from earlier this week. I find that the steady , currently trading at $1497, look evident enough to show the quantum of growing uncertainty in global equity markets; which is likely to move upward during the upcoming week.\n\nInfosys Ltd.
