The detailed stories on Weinstein published by The New York Times and The New Yorker in 2017 shared a Pulitzer Prize and are credited with igniting the global #MeToo movement.\n\nFarrow's book also makes repeated references to former National Enquirer editor in chief Dylan Howard, whose lawyers sent letters to Australian booksellers threatening lawsuits.\n\nAmazon Australia and Booktopia declined to comment Thursday on their decisions not to sell Farrow's book.\n\nA number of smaller Australian book retailers received letters from Howard's law firm McLachlan Thorpe Partners, but most did not.\n\nLawyer Andrew Thorpe, who signed the letters, did not respond when asked by AP who had received them.\n\nFILE - In this April 13, 2018 file photo, Ronan Farrow attends Variety's Power of Women event in New York.

It's now available in bookshops and some online retailers,\" Egelstaff said.\n\nFarrow tweeted that some Australian book outlets had \"caved and banned it due to frivolous legal threats.\"\n\nFarrow added that he hoped Australian readers \"can import or buy from an independent bookseller, and avoid outlets that yield to these kinds of intimidation tactics.\"\n\nRobbie Egan, chief executive of the Australian Booksellers Association, said the two big online retailers were the only Australian outlets he knew of that had decided against stocking the book.\n\n\"There's no legal threat: it's just the threat of the possibility of legal threat,\" Egan said. \"I can't recall anything like this and I've been doing it (selling books) for 25 years.\"\n\nDavid Gaunt, owner of Gleebooks in Sydney, said he had not been notified by the publisher or anyone else of a legal threat. He had sold out of the book by Thursday.\n\n\"There's no way it would have got the publicity that it's got if it hadn't been for the attempt to ban it,\" Gaunt said. \"Unless people contacted the publisher to say: 'What should I do?', the publisher is being very relaxed about the whole thing.\"\n\nMark Rubbo, managing director of Melbourne retailer Readings, said he disregarded the legal letter he received because of the important issues the book raised.\n\n\"The letter just said it may contain defamatory content - so it didn't say it did - and I didn't feel that was a strong enough reason not to sell it,\" Rubbo said.", "description": "CANBERRA, Australia (AP) - Ronan Farrow's new book is being sold in Australia despite threats of defamation lawsuits that the Pulitzer-winning journalist...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/09/wire-19825852-1571299413-193_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
