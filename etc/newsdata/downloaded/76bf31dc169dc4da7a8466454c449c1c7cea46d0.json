The last time an enthronement ceremony took place was in 1990, when the then-emperor Akihito formally ascended the throne.\n\nSmall crowds turned out on Tuesday morning outside the palace despite a heavy downpour.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption People waiting outside the Imperial Palace\n\n\"Today is an important day for the new emperor and the empress,\" 78-year-old Shuichi Hachinuma, who had travelled to Tokyo, told news agency AFP.\n\n\"I feel the emperor is closer to us, compared to in the past... I want him to send a message of peace.\"\n\nThe torrential winds and rains cleared just as the ceremony began.\n\nSome social media users claimed a rainbow appeared just in time for the ceremony.\n\nDidn't Naruhito already ascend the throne?\n\nEmperor Naruhito officially began his reign on 1 May.\n\nAccording to news site the Japan Times, the ceremonies conducted on that day were \"simpler, and meant to signify the inheritance of the throne immediately\".\n\nThe Sokui no rei was a much more elaborate affair.\n\nIt's not uncommon for there to be a gap between the first succession to the throne and the Sokui no rei.\n\nFor Emperor Akihito, there was an almost two-year gap between his succession to the throne and the Sokui no rei.\n\nAccording to one Japanese expert, the reason for the confusion this time round was because then-Emperor Akihito's abdication broke away from the normal procedure.\n\nHe abdicated due to poor health, becoming the first monarch to abdicate in more than 200 years.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The then-emperor Akihito (L) abdicated citing his age and failing health\n\nUsually, the celebratory enthronement can only take place after at least a year of mourning.\n\nBut because Emperor Akihito had stepped down, the ascension of Emperor Naruhito then was seen as much more of a celebration.\n\n\"The world just assumed that that [on 1 May] was the combined celebration, but the real celebration is what's happening now,\" Ken Ruoff, author of Japan's Imperial House in the Postwar Era, told the BBC.\n\n\"It's not perceived as a big deal [to] the rest of the world who are like 'didn't we already do this?' But it's a big deal for the Japanese.\"", "description": "The elaborate ceremony, conducted largely in silence, is thought to date back more than a thousand years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rpk1h.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
