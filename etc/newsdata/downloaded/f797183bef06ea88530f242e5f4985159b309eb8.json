One of Henry\u2019s new paving stones exploded in the intense heat of the glowing cinder pile.\n\n\u2018As well as sending bits of slate flying about, it had thrown up red-hot embers in every direction. When we sat down to eat, nearly all of us had bits of rubble in our hair and burnt bits in our clothes.\n\n\u2018My wife was wearing this wonderful pair of boots.
