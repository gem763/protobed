Lauren Chatmas told Warrior earlier this year.\n\nA formal Analysis of Alternatives, expected to complete this year, is weighing the advantages of leveraging nearer-term existing technologies such as new variants or upgrades to cutting edge weapons, sensors and stealth configurations - or allowing more time for leap-ahead developmental systems to emerge.\n\nThe current analysis follows a now-completed Initial Capabilities Document detailing some of the sought-after requirements for the new aircraft, or \u201cfamily of aircraft,\u201d Chatmas explained.\n\nAnticipated decisions about a 6th-Gen fighter balance themselves upon the as-of-yet unknown maturity of various promising new weapons and technologies nearing a threshold of operational possibility.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "The Navy is currently analyzing air frames, targeting systems, AI-enabled sensors, new weapons and engine technologies to engineer a new 6th-Generation fighter to fly alongside the F-35 and ultimately replace the F/A-18.", "authors": ["Kris Osborn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xEr7x75X8IOrNNbzcgAsOQ--~B/aD05NTg7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/1a0e0cf416eb5f9a82589ea3e93ae668", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
