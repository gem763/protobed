Not a specific pizza box, because they all pretty much look the same, but all the pizza boxes you might have encountered anytime in the last half century or so. They\u2019re probably some combination of red, white and green, and maybe feature an Italian-looking chef with a swirly mustache. They\u2019re bulky, and you struggle to fit them in your fridge when there are leftovers, or even in your trash can when they\u2019re empty.\n\nThe pizza box has been this way for decades, even as cars have gone electric and phones have become pocket-size, portable means of accessing the whole of human knowledge (or at least a lot of cat videos). Innovation in the pizza-box space has consisted of the addition of those miniature plastic platforms that keep the top of the box from sticking to the cheese below. Maybe a vent or two to keep air circulating. Little cupholders for garlic butter or ranch dressing.\n\n[Where does your go-to frozen pizza rank? We tried 15, and the worst one might surprise you.]\n\nAnd so what might seem like a small step \u2014 Pizza Hut\u2019s announcement Tuesday that it\u2019s trying out a high-tech new design that\u2019s round instead of square \u2014 feels like a giant leap for pizza-kind.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, only marginal changes have been made to pizza boxes through the years,\u201d Nicolas Burquier, Pizza Hut\u2019s chief customer and operations officer, said in an email. \u201cThis round box leverages new technology and represents step change innovation.\u201d\n\nThe pie chain\u2019s claims about the new box are many. Some of its shiny new features are meant to improve its function and use: The round shape means there\u2019s less waste (i.e., it\u2019s better for the environment), and it\u2019s made of sustainably harvested plant fiber. It\u2019s industrially compostable. Less material also means it takes up less space on the shelves of Pizza Hut locations \u2014 and in your fridge.\n\n\n\n(Emily Heil/The Washington Post)\n\nThe box (can you even call a disc-shaped vessel a box? Discuss.) has ridges on the bottom exterior and grooves in the top, so multiples can lock together, meaning there\u2019s no slipping during delivery or when you\u2019re toting a stack into a party. They don\u2019t require time-consuming assembling by employees, and they break down easily \u2014 you can fold them over multiple times until you have something compact enough to drop into your trash can.\n\nAnd there are taste claims, too. Grooves along the bottom help catch grease and circulate air to prevent soggy crust, says Pizza Hut, and the latch closure keeps heat in, so your pie ostensibly stays warmer longer.\n\n\u201cI think one day in the future we\u2019ll reminisce about the idea of round pizzas in square boxes and laugh,\u201d Burquier said.\n\n[Should you order Pizza Hut, Domino\u2019s or Papa John\u2019s? Our blind taste test picks a winner.]\n\nBurquier described the box as the result of a two-year development process along with Zume, the Silicon Valley start-up company whose pizza-delivery innovations include robots assembling the pies and trucks that bake your pizza en route to your home to cut down on what\u2019s known in the industry as \u201cdwell time.\u201d Their method, he said, was hands \u2014 and taste buds \u2014 on: \u201cWe ate a LOT of pizza.\u201d\n\nZume first introduced a round pizza box, which it called the Pizza Pod, in 2017. And Apple has a patented circular pizza box that it uses for the pizzas served in its campus cafeterias.\n\nBut Scott Wiener, a pizza-box collector and author of \u201cViva la Pizza!: The Art of the Pizza Box,\u201d says it\u2019s potentially significant for a giant like Pizza Hut to start using a 2.0-style box. \u201cThat could be huge,\u201d he said. He said cost is the primary factor stifling pizza-box innovation. Most pizza joints are content with the cheap-to-produce cardboard versions. \u201cThere was this cool pizza box out of India that had perforations that allowed steam to escape indirectly \u2014 basically it vented out but kept the heat in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t take off because it\u2019s expensive to produce.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Emily Heil/The Washington Post)\n\nBurquier didn\u2019t say how much the new box costs in comparison to the standard version, though he said that \u201cinnovative manufacturing processes\u201d would keep it from impacting the price the chain charges. Initially, Pizza Hut is testing the new design in Phoenix, with plans to roll it out to other areas in the future.\n\nIt\u2019s a big change for the company, which has been using standard boxes since the 1970s, with designs that included a 1972 version printed to look like a newspaper called the Pizza Hut Gazette and an early-1980s style with a classic Italian checked tablecloth motif. Before boxes, the company relied on a delivery system called the \u201cSack and Circle,\u201d which sounds like a football play but actually describes packaging a pizza on a round of corrugated cardboard inside a bag.\n\n[How to master homemade pizza, from crust to toppings]\n\nOh, how times have changed. We had Pizza Hut ship us a few samples of the new whiz-bang receptacle so we could kick its tires. Out of the box (yes, the box arrived in a box \u2014 so very meta) it looked promising: sturdy (no center sag) but relatively lightweight, with an easy-to-snap lid. The stacking feature felt nice and secure.\n\nBut all that assessment was simply of an empty box. The real question was: How would it perform in the field? We mocked up a trial wherein we ordered two identical pizzas from Pizza Hut, each with half cheese and half sausage and onion. We gave the bottom of the new box to the friendly people behind the counter and asked that one of the pizzas be placed on it, with the other going into the standard box, which comes lined with a corrugated liner and one of the aforementioned plastic tabletop thingees. When they were both ready, we clicked the top on the new box and took both pies back to the office.\n\nThe new box felt much more secure and easy to handle. We didn\u2019t have to palm it in the center of the pie like you often do with the classic pizza tote. And it didn\u2019t seem to slide around while it was perched on the seat of the Uber.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, we opened both boxes and found \u2026 almost no discernible differences between the two. In fact, the pizza that had traveled in the traditional box was 2 degrees warmer (we used both an instant-read and gun thermometer). The crusts and integrity of the toppings were completely indistinguishable. Now, it\u2019s entirely possible that this was the fault of our imperfect test.\n\nBut when it came time to toss the remnants of lunch, we appreciated the way the new container folded up for easy disposal.\n\nWas it possible we were witnessing the future? That someday, when we\u2019re picking up a pie by spaceship \u2014 or drone \u2014 we won\u2019t even remember a time when pizza came in square boxes with mustachioed chefs on them and cursive fonts proclaiming the contents to be fresh, hot and delicious?\n\nMaybe, says Wiener, though he thinks that whatever shape our pizza vessels take and whatever snazzy improvements are made, the traditional one will always be an icon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll always have that connotation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a classic.\u201d\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nImpossible vs. Beyond: We tested cook-at-home versions to see who makes a better vegan burger\n\nThis high-tech vegan ice cream may be good enough to fool even die-hard dairy lovers\n\nKFC\u2019s new fried chicken and doughnut sandwich is terrifying and delicious", "description": "It's round.
