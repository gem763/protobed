They were a roaring hit at the latter, where the air beds struck the perfect balance between comfort and carriability: sleeping on the equivalent of a double bed, with a sheet and duvet, has become the new festival benchmark for one of our (formerly) hardy reviewers.\n\nFirst of all we looked out for the dreaded air leak. Recognising that it\u2019s almost impossible to stop beds leaking completely, we allowed a little sag (particularly if there were being used by two people), but not all-out overnight deflation.\n\nThen we tested for comfort, something that\u2019s hard to perfect with an air bed: we looked out for the dreaded wobble, a sort of instability that only afflicts overinflated beds. We preferred beds with multiple air chambers or a bit of foam, because they had an added sense of stability and bed-like familiarity.\n\nBeyond that, the choice comes down to what you want to use your air bed for, and where you\u2019re going to use it. Because many are completely filled with air, they lose out on some of the technical insulation you get with camping mats, for example.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s not an issue if you\u2019re sleeping on carpet: but it can quickly become one if you\u2019re outdoors. Trust us: even with a brilliant sleeping bag, it\u2019s amazing how quickly the cold can seep into your bones on a badly insulated mattress.\n\nWe\u2019ve recommended some camping-specific beds below, which have added insulation, but if you want the comfort of a bed-sized mattress outside \u2013 at a festival, for example \u2013 put a thin foam mat under the mattress for warmth (one with a silver reflective side is best).\n\nIt\u2019s also worth considering who will be sleeping on the air bed: your fanciest friends might feel a bit put out if you put them on a low mat like the Robens at the end of a dinner party; conversely, you would look ridiculous trying to smooth out the valance on your Aerobed at the foot of Scafell Pike. Pick something sturdy if children are going to sleep on the bed \u2013 or if a teenager might drag it to a festival.\n\nA quick word on inflation: some of the mats below are self-inflating, and we\u2019ve specified that. If they\u2019re not, you will need to buy a separate pump to blow them up. Hand pumps are the cheapest but the hardiest; battery-powered pumps are time-honoured \u2013 rechargeable lithium ones are great; but we swear by a simple 12-volt charging pump that plugs into the cigarette lighter in the car for ultimate ease if you\u2019re car camping.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Our reviewer decided not to test that out themselves \u2013 there are plenty of videos on YouTube if you want to check \u2013 but has put this mattress through enough festivals and camping trips to believe it. Coleman\u2019s extra durable bed is just the right height for comfort without being so high you get the air bed wobble; it\u2019s perfectly firm and about as close to a real bed as you can get on a camping trip. It\u2019s also quick and easy to pack up and roll away, not absurdly heavy (at just under 3kg), and inflates quickly and easily \u2013 we tested with a 12v car pump and the rechargeable battery pump that Coleman recommends. A great price for an air bed that will survive anything you can throw at it.\n\nBuy now\n\nAeroBed ultra divan double air bed: \u00a3250, John Lewis & Partners\n\nThe ultimate guestroom air bed, Aerobed\u2019s divan double \u2013 which is the same height as a standard bed and comes with a cotton valance and a mattress protector \u2013 looks almost disconcertingly like an actual double bed. This is not an air bed for camping: its pump plugs into the mains, and is remote controlled, which means inflating it is literally as simple as pressing a button. You can increase or decrease pressure as well using a small panel at the end of the bed to get just the right level of firmness. It doesn\u2019t feel exactly like a sprung mattress \u2013 although at maximum firmness it\u2019s among the closest of the beds we tested \u2013 but looks so good your guests may well not notice. It deflates in seconds thanks to the brand's self-named \u201cwhoosh\u201d valve, which we loved: children and particularly immature adults will enjoy the rapid descent.\n\nBuy now\n\nOutwell wonderland double air bed: \u00a3185.99, Outwell\u200b\n\nThe most comfortable one we tested, the Outwell wonderland, packs an air bed plus memory foam mattress in one portable package. The air bed itself is a standard, no-frills 12cm tall air mattress, but the game changer is the memory foam topper that acts as a kind of thin mattress that sits on top. The two are held together by a soft, zip-close quilted cover. The memory foam topper makes this bed extra special: our reviewer thought it felt much closer to a real bed because of the added support, and it also felt much warmer when we tested it outside because there\u2019s more between you and the ground than just air and plastic. At 8kg, you wouldn\u2019t want to carry it into the wilderness, but it would be the perfect bed for a long camping holiday.\n\nBuy now\n\nQuechua inflatable camping bed base: \u00a349.99, Decathlon\n\nWe were borderline obsessed with this brilliant idea from Decathlon, an inflatable bed frame to which you attach your favourite camping mattress to create something between an air bed and a camping bed. The inflatable frame is reinforced with sturdy little struts, and the bars that go across the frame \u2013 that you lay your mattress on \u2013 feel really secure: they don\u2019t collapse in when you lie on them, which was our main concern. The best thing about this bed is that it feels much more like a normal bed \u2013 from the way it responds when you move around, for example, to the breadth of places you feel supported. The frame will take any mattress under 70cm wide: we found that foam mats (like the multimat in this review) worked better than air inflated mats.\n\nBuy now\n\nRobens highcore 80 air bed: \u00a359.95, Trek Inn\n\nWe love Robens\u2019 camping gear: the German brand always seems to have some of the best tech for a budget price. So we were really excited to test out the highcore 80, new for 2019, which our reviewer thought was the most versatile air bed that we tried. It isn\u2019t as tall as, say, the Aerobed \u2013 about 9cm fully inflated \u2013 but we actually thought that gave us a better night\u2019s sleep, because the bed felt a bit more secure. It was also deliciously warm \u2013 easily as warm as a technical camping mat \u2013 thanks to the insulation. The valve lets you adjust the firmness easily \u2013 because it has a one way airflow to let you adjust breath by breath \u2013 something that tends to only come with more expensive mats. It\u2019s light, at 720g, making it the perfect mat for camping or backpacking, if you haven\u2019t got too far to walk.\n\nBuy now\n\nSea to Summit ether light air bed: \u00a3175, Sea to Summit\n\nOur reviewer was genuinely astonished when she inflated the ether light for the first time: it just seemed to keep rising and rising, up to about 10cm height in the end. That\u2019s not far off the height of a normal air bed like the Coleman: and this bed weighs in at 420g, and packs down very small. We\u2019ve loved Sea to Summit\u2019s air sprung cells ever since we tried our first from the brand. The little dimpled pockets really do feel like a proper sprung mattress. Our favourite thing about this bed is how warm it was: tricky to achieve with 10cm of air between you and the cold ground, but achieved here with a thick insulating layer. There are all the usual perks of a Sea to Summit mat \u2013 the one-way valve, for example, that lets you finesse firmness, and the pillow lock system, which is compatible with Sea to Summit inflatable pillows. Our reviewer \u2013 who admittedly is a seasoned camper \u2013 would be happy on this in a guest bedroom.\n\nBuy now\n\nCampingaz smart quickbed double air bed: \u00a339.99, Amazon\n\nA really clever, innovative air bed by Campingaz, this comes with built in pillows \u2013 a small but extremely useful feature, as anyone who\u2019s had a pillow slip off the back of a camping mat before will tell you \u2013 and, amazingly, little storage compartments beneath the pillows, inside the mattress. It falls down on a few details \u2013 it loses air overnight, for example. Not too dramatically, but noticeably so that you'll need to pump it up again in the evening ahead of the next night\u2019s sleep. It\u2019s also a little cold \u2013 you definitely need a mat underneath if you plan to use it in winter weather. But overall this is the perfect bed to take to a festival: it\u2019s comfortable but not colossal, and the hidden compartment might well be the best solution we\u2019ve seen to the problem of where to safely store your valuables.\n\nBuy now\n\nVango shangri la 10 double air bed: \u00a3250, Vango\u200b\n\nAn absolute classic, Vango\u2019s plush air bed scored highly in our review because it was comfortable, sturdy, and best of all \u2013 self inflating. It inflates to a height of about 10cm in just under a minute \u2013 although we found it needed a couple of extra puffs to get it as firm as we liked, but that\u2019s easily done. It felt really sturdy and comfortable and spacious, while the memory foam gave it a welcome layer of support. Generally speaking our reviewers didn\u2019t bother putting a sheet on all the air beds they tested \u2013 but we tested one here and found that, thanks to the square box-shape construction, it felt remarkably like a proper bed. It felt warm enough to us tested in the summer \u2013 probably thanks to the memory foam layer \u2013 but we would suggest a foam mat underneath during the winter. Overall a perfect bed for camping and the occasional sleepover.\n\nBuy now\n\nThermarest mondoking 3D air bed: \u00a3146.95, OutdoorGear\u200b\n\nIf you\u2019re used to Thermarest making super-minimalist camping mats that weigh almost nothing but barely lift you off the ground, then this one will come as a pleasant surprise. One of the most luxurious air beds we tested, it self-inflates up to about 10cm, with a thick foam core for warmth and support and a stretch knit outer. We found it to be one of the few beds that we really didn\u2019t need a sheet on, which will help to justify the slightly larger pack size and weight compared to a standard Thermarest mattress \u2013 about 2.5kg. We also like that it attaches to other Thermarest mattresses to create a bigger-than-double bed: ideal if you\u2019re sleeping in a large family tent or having plenty of floorspace in your spare room.\n\nBuy now\n\nHalfords flocked air bed: \u00a38.50, Halfords\u200b\n\nAbsolutely ideal for sleepovers, festivals or lounging around in the garden, Halfords\u2019 cheap and cheerful air bed covers all the bases \u2013 it\u2019s got plenty of clearance, at 18cm in height, it\u2019s super soft to the touch, so you won\u2019t need a sheet, and it\u2019s got sprung dimples to make it feel a bit more like a proper mattress. It inflates and deflates quickly, and for the size, rolls up to pack away easily. While it might lose some pressure over time, we didn\u2019t find it leaked as much air as we\u2019d expected \u2013 it managed a full night without deflating, better than some more expensive beds that we tested. It has a touch of the classic air bed wobble, and it doesn\u2019t feel as sturdy as the Coleman, but at \u00a38.50 it\u2019s a really good budget option.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Air beds\n\nA time-honoured classic, nothing can beat the Coleman extra durable double air bed for durability, comfort, price and all-round versatility. If you want your air bed to be a bit more of a guest-room feature, the lovely Aerobed ultra divan double is a pricey but pretty option. If you want something a bit more portable, Sea to Summit ether light air bed was impressively comfortable for the weight.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
