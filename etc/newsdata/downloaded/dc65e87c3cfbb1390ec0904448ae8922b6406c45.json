The plans will be discussed at next month's shareholders meeting.\n\nThere is a recognition that many leagues across the world share the same problem along with a hope for understanding around what is a unique situation. The World Cup has been switched to winter due to the searing summer heat in Qatar, when temperatures can reach 40c.\n\nUEFA said a decision on the scheduling of that season's Champions League and Europa League will not be made until 2021. Leagues One and Two are expected to continue as normal.\n\nThe Premier League declined to comment.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY MIKE KEEGAN: The Premier League have drawn up plans that would see games played just over a week before the 2022 World Cup starts.", "authors": ["Mike Keegan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/22/20103484-0-image-a-5_1571864641314.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
