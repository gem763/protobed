They\u2019re the kind of neighbors from whom you borrow a cup of sugar and whom you trust to pick up your children from school when you\u2019re stuck in a meeting. They invite you over on summer evenings for lemonade at the table in the backyard next to the hydrangeas. You eat their Jell-O salad at picnics. (Lime Jell-O is so popular among Mormons that the corridor of Mormon communities from Utah to Idaho is often called \u201cthe Jell-O Belt.\u201d) And, of course, you see them every Sunday at church.\n\nJoseph, 27, lives just west of Salt Lake City in a Mormon ward that spans a couple of streets. His church is just down the road, and the bishop, who presides over the ward, lives around the corner. Most of his neighbors are active within the Church, and when Joseph first moved in, he was, too. After he and his wife began trying to start a family, they became particularly close to their neighbors across the street who were older and had children of their own. The couple included them in all of their entertaining. The neighbors didn\u2019t have an ice maker, so, often, one of them would swing by to pillage Joseph\u2019s ice and chat. Their friendship was a paradigm of neighbordom, which inspires envy in this writer, whose interactions with her neighbors are limited to whacking the wall with a Swiffer when their music is too loud.\n\nA family can also be very petty, especially when one of its own begins to drift away\n\nIn an article written for the Church\u2019s official newsroom, titled \u201cWhy Mormons Make Good Neighbors,\u201d Elder Larry Y. Wilson extols his fellow \u201cchurch-attending Latter-day Saints\u201d for their neighborliness. He begins with a quote drawn from a letter Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote to Winston Churchill: \u201cI have a very high opinion of the Mormons\u2014for they are excellent citizens.\u201d (Wilson does not include the rest of Roosevelt\u2019s quote, which ends in a barrel-bellied jab about polyamory.) He goes on to cite a survey showing that Mormons feel warmer toward their own members than any other religious group. \u201cPracticing Latter-day Saints tend to be healthier, happier, better educated, and more committed to family values,\u201d Wilson writes. \u201cThe Latter-day Saint community functions like an extended family.\u201d\n\nDepending on your experiences with extended family, Wilson\u2019s comparison is either a soothing affirmation or a grim warning. A family can be very warm \u2014 particularly when that family is tied together by proximity, faith, a sweeping shared value system, a history of persecution, and the belief that \u201cthe disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.\u201d A family can also be very petty, especially when one of its own begins to drift away.\n\nLast summer, Joseph chose to stop attending church services. He made his decision in the wake of a protest by Sam Young, a businessman and former bishop from Texas. Young had been fasting for weeks to raise awareness about a policy that allowed bishops to conduct one-on-one interviews with minors, often about sexual matters. His cause struck a chord with Joseph, who was sexually abused when he was younger. Joseph attended several events Young held, and after one of them, he never went back to church again.\n\nJoseph and his wife also announced their decision to their neighbors. \u201cWe still hang out with them,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it just seems like, recently, they\u2019re more distant. We don\u2019t get invited over very often.\u201d They still talk sometimes, but the friendship has chilled a bit, if you will: Joseph\u2019s friend doesn\u2019t swing by for ice anymore. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t come over at all or check in on us to see how we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s just kind of sad. Not only are we leaving the Church, but we\u2019re leaving our friends. We\u2019re leaving our life. We\u2019re leaving everything.\u201d\n\nJoseph hasn\u2019t attended church services in nearly a year. He canceled the automatic payments that withdrew a 10 percent tithe from his income each month. When he\u2019s out mowing his front lawn, his neighbors don\u2019t greet him. Some don\u2019t even look at him, and when they do, they stare pointedly at the tattoos he\u2019s gotten in the past year.\n\nBut Joseph has joined a new community, one built of former Mormons who have found each other on the internet and who are committed to helping each other navigate the logistical and existential difficulties of leaving the Church.\n\nIn recent years, the Church has been embattled by the efficiency of the internet. It\u2019s never been easier to stumble across information that contradicts the pillars of faith. That\u2019s true for many religions but especially Mormonism, which has a very recent history. Where the unsavory specifics of an older faith\u2019s origins may have been eroded by time, reduced to a handful of too-old-to-question texts and some shriveled relics, the early years of Mormonism are well-documented and easily examined online. The internet has also given Mormons new platforms, from forums to podcasts, where they can share their findings. The result has been a mass undoctrination.\n\nBut even when Mormons who choose to leave the Church can do so with the click of a button, it\u2019s not that simple.\n\nDuring a Q&A at Utah State University in 2011, Elder Marlin K. Jensen, who was then the official Church historian, fielded a polite hardball question from a woman in the audience. She asked when the Church\u2019s manuals would begin reflecting what she\u2019d learned about the Church through her own research. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting, in several of the scriptures that give us the information about what the Church historian should do, it\u2019s \u2018speak to the rising generation,\u2019\u201d Jensen said. \u201cSo our hope is to equip them, in a knowledgeable way \u2014 to give reason for the hope that is in them, and to do it in age-specific ways.\u201d\n\nThe woman then asked Jensen whether he was aware that many Mormons were leaving the Church because of what they\u2019d learned about Church history on Google.\n\n\u201cWe are aware,\u201d Jensen said, sounding defeated. \u201cWe do have another initiative that we\u2019ve called \u2018Answers to Gospel Questions.\u2019 We\u2019re trying to figure out exactly what channel to deliver it in, and exactly what format to put it in, but we want to have a place where people can go. We have hired someone that\u2019s in charge of search engine optimization.\u201d Salvation was suddenly a matter of clicks: it was up to Google\u2019s algorithms whether a Mormon seeking answers found them on LDS.org or on an ex-Mormon blog. The Church began a 21st century crusade for its members\u2019 attention.\n\nLDS.org is now ChurchofJesusChrist.org, recently changed to encourage the use of the Church\u2019s proper name: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. (The update appears to have temporarily hindered the Church\u2019s search engine optimization. Until June, the Church\u2019s SEO was so good that LDS.org generally outranked Wikipedia in any Google search that included the term \u201cMormon.\u201d)\n\n\u201cEverything I read just made me more and more sure it was wrong.\u201d\n\nMormons struggling with questions about their faith can either seek help from their bishop or, says Church spokesman Daniel Woodruff, they can find scriptures, articles from Church leaders, and video libraries on ChurchofJesusChrist.org. Woodruff also points me to the Gospel Topics Essays, a series on divisive points in the Church\u2019s history (\u201cPlural Marriage and Families in Early Utah\u201d) and its present (\u201cBook of Mormon and DNA Studies\u201d). The Church began releasing the Gospel Topics Essays in 2013. They are the \u201cAnswers to Gospel Questions\u201d that Jensen teased in 2011.\n\nBut the Gospel Topics Essays don\u2019t always validate beliefs. One former Mormon tells me she began to have questions about Church history when she was helping her daughter study scripture ahead of her baptism. When she read that the Book of Mormon said Christopher Columbus would discover America, her mind snagged on a loose thread: she knew there\u2019d been people in America before Columbus. \u201cI started reading the Church essays that they\u2019ve recently released \u2014 on blacks and the priesthood, homosexuals, stuff like that \u2014 and everything I read just made me more and more sure it was wrong.\u201d\n\nEvan Lloyd, a 41-year-old lawyer in Arizona who left the Church last year, speculates that most Mormons don\u2019t even know the Gospel Topics Essays exist. \u201cThey are really hard to find, even on their website. You really almost have to go through Google to get to the part of the website where they are,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you go to your bishop\u2019s office and you\u2019re like, \u2018I read about Joseph Smith having 30 wives, and one of them was 14, and he was marrying married women\u2019 \u2014 that freaked me out \u2014 then the bishop can go, \u2018But we\u2019ve had it on the website. We never hid it from anybody. It\u2019s just not something we talk about.\u2019\u201d\n\nAn article in a cached 2015 back issue of the Church\u2019s magazine, Ensign, called \u201cWhen Doubts and Questions Arise\u201d draws a distinction between questions and doubts. \u201cLargely because of the internet,\u201d writer Adam Kotter begins, \u201cit is not uncommon for members of the Church to encounter ideas that challenge their beliefs. Some members find the questions raised to be disconcerting and wonder whether it is acceptable to have a question about their faith.\u201d But where questions are asked in the hope of affirming one\u2019s beliefs, Kotter writes, a doubter withholds his obedience until his doubts have been satisfactorily addressed.\n\nJoseph started out as a questioner. He read the Essays in depth and studied the resources on FairMormon, a nonprofit providing \u201cFaithful Answers to Criticisms of the LDS Church.\u201d But he says that questioning the Church without suspending his faith made him feel like he was doing \u201cmental gymnastics.\u201d Like many doubting Mormons, he made his way to Reddit. In particular, he began to haunt the \u201cexmormon\u201d subreddit, a haven for Mormons scrutinizing the Church\u2019s teachings. The subreddit has over 123,000 members and is perhaps the purest expression of the internet as a \u201cresource.\u201d Members come to post questions (logistical and philosophical), to share beer recommendations for first-timers (most active Mormons don\u2019t drink alcohol, tea, and coffee), and to vent (\u201cI suppose to her, families are forever, unless someone comes out as trans.\u201d)\n\nMany come just to read. A few originally joined as \u201cdownvoters,\u201d faithful Mormons who lurk in the subreddit solely to vote down posts. Moderator vh65 tells me that some of those downvoters are now regular posters themselves. \u201cAfter a month, they\u2019re like, \u2018Wait a minute\u2014that can\u2019t be right,\u2019 and they start researching. Now some of them are very well-known, popular posters who completely swing the other way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the LGBT policy leak came out, I was enraged by it.\u201d\n\nvh65 began researching Church history after someone in the subreddit linked to a New York Times interview in which she read that Joseph Smith had married a 14-year-old. vh65 says that the internet\u2019s real impact on her faith was not in allowing her to stumble across information that disturbed her, but in the way she was able to deeply research that information and verify its accuracy using sources she trusted. She began a reverse catechism, starting with primary documents from Church history: the Joseph Smith Papers Project, Smith\u2019s 14-year-old wife Helen Mar Kimball\u2019s recollections, and issues of The Evening and the Morning Star, a Mormon newspaper published in the 1830s.\n\nMost importantly, vh65 explains, conducting her research on the internet didn\u2019t require vh65 to engage with anyone. While unvarnished accounts of Church history have always been available \u2014 Fawn M. Brodie\u2019s 1945 biography of Joseph Smith, for instance \u2014 it used to be much harder to access them discreetly.\n\n\u201cWhen you wanted to research, you had to go to Sanders\u2019 bookstore,\u201d says vh65, referring to Ken Sanders Rare Books in Salt Lake City, \u201cand that was kind of like a woman going to a liquor store in a small town in Utah \u2014 everybody\u2019s going to know, right?\u201d\n\nNone of that social queasiness exists on Reddit. Sometimes users even include their real names in screenshots from QuitMormon.com, showing that they\u2019ve submitted their resignations. QuitMormon is a pro bono service run by an unassuming T-shirt-and-jeans Utah immigration attorney named Mark Naugle. The 34-year-old has streamlined the process of resigning from the Church. When users are ready to have their names removed from Church records, they simply submit a request to Naugle that includes their name, date of birth, address, membership number, and whether they\u2019re a minor. Naugle takes it from there, sending a form letter to the Church that requests the removal of the client\u2019s information from all records. Crucially, the letter also forbids further contact between the Church and his client. Mormons never have to reach out to their bishops to explain their decision to leave, and they won\u2019t receive well-meaning visits from their former peers.\n\nNaugle first began helping friends and family with their name removal requests in 2010 after graduating from law school in Utah in 2009. He lived out of state for a while before moving back to Utah in 2015. He\u2019d begun to frequent r/exmormon, and in the spring of 2015, he began offering his services to strangers. That November, there was a surge of requests after Mormons learned, through a leak to the media, that children of LGBTQ couples could not get baptized. In April, Church president Dallin H. Oaks announced that LDS leadership had rolled back the policy, but r/exmormon was alive with criticisms for what some viewed as a too-little-too-late gesture: \u201c\u2018We want to reduce the hate and contention so common today,\u2019 says Oaks, as if he wasn\u2019t the one most prolifically supporting it,\u201d one Redditor wrote. \u201cFuck bigoted old men!\u201d said another.\n\n\u201cWhen the LGBT policy leak came out, I was enraged by it,\u201d Naugle says of the initial leak. \u201cA lot of people were. I went onto Reddit and just said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve offered this before. I\u2019m willing to do it now. Here\u2019s my email address.\u2019\u201d Until November 2015, he\u2019d received no more than 200 requests for his services. After that day, he received 2,000 emails in 48 hours. (r/exmormon also saw an enormous spike in membership then.) People offered to help him build the website and automate the process, and QuitMormon.com was born.\n\nNaugle has seen more leaps in requests since then. His inbox is like a seismometer for Mormon discontent. When, for instance, a then-Mormon named Jeremy Runnells published a letter he\u2019d written to Church Educational System (CES) outlining his doubts about the Church\u2019s teachings, it tore through communities. Almost every former Mormon I spoke to cited Runnells\u2019 letter as a catalyst for their departure. Then, there was Sunday, September 16th, 2018, the day Sam Young, whose protest had motivated Joseph\u2019s break with the Church, read his excommunication letter aloud in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe next morning, Naugle arrived at work. \u201cI pulled up the queue, and realized something had happened over the weekend,\u201d Naugle recalls. Over the next two weeks, he received about 2,500 more resignation requests.\n\nLike any popular online community \u2014 and any offline community, really \u2014 r/exmormon has a spectrum of tone. vh65 says that r/exmormon used to look a lot more like r/mormon, which has fewer members and fewer memes. Some users on r/exmormon are more radical than others in their resentment for the Church.\n\n\u201cAny visitor to this subreddit looking to confirm the \u2018angry bitter resentful ex-Mormon\u2019 stereotype could do so pretty quickly,\u201d one Redditor wrote in a post for r/exmormon newcomers. \u201cIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that the \u2018angry bitter resentful ex-Mormons\u2019 are probably overrepresented here, as many who leave the Church completely move on and don\u2019t even give it a second thought anymore.\u201d\n\nFor instance, where more aggressive r/exmormon contributors use the word \u201ccult\u201d to describe the Church, many avoid it. It\u2019s a bitter word for people who have recently emerged from a community renowned for its Stepford politeness. \u201cI hate using the word cult, but it\u2019s so hard not to call it that,\u201d one former Mormon says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be nasty.\u201d\n\nNaugle has no reservations about the term.\n\n\u201cEvery time she gets in an Uber, she\u2019ll ask someone what their religion is.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny organization that tells you what to eat, what to do with your body, what to do on specific days of the week, and then ostracizes you when you actively disavow them, I think is a cult,\u201d he says. \u201cAny organization that requires a lawyer\u2019s help to leave it so that they stop harassing you and stop hunting you down worldwide I also think is a cult. Having experienced it myself, having been in the organization and knowing the psychological damage it can cause, they\u2019re a cult.\u201d\n\nNaugle went through the process of resigning from the Church in 1999 when he was 14. He grew up in Orem, Utah. Orem is a town south of Salt Lake City, bordered by the same chapped mountains, but it\u2019s much more conservative.\n\nInitially, I thought of Naugle as the Pied Piper of doubters, merrily guiding Mormons into digital sin. But Naugle doesn\u2019t feel that it\u2019s his responsibility to convince \u2014 or even gently encourage \u2014 Mormons to leave the Church. He says he leaves that mantle to other former Mormons, like Jeremy Runnells, the author of the CES Letter, and John Dehlin, who mans the popular podcast Mormon Stories. Naugle says he largely refrains from posting on r/exmormon, except to give updates on changes to the QuitMormon process.\n\nI\u2019d also expected someone who spends 40 hours a week helping other people leave the Church to describe his experiences with more vitriol, but Naugle talks about his time as a Mormon with the calm detachment of someone describing being under anesthesia.\n\nThe Boy Scouts are a sore spot. In Utah, the Boy Scouts used to be intertwined with the Church to the extent that Naugle\u2019s troop met in church buildings, and meetings were led by men from his church. He recalls one incident when he and several co-Scouts were playing Go Fish on a camping trip. One of the particularly devout troop leaders, in an apparent geyser of reverence, blustered into their tent. He told the boys that by playing with face cards, they were summoning Satan and told them to go pray for an hour. (President Joseph F. Smith said that the immoderate repetition of card games leads to \u201can infatuation for chance schemes\u201d and ends in \u201cthe complete destruction of religious feeling.\u201d) When his family left the Church, Naugle says, he knew he couldn\u2019t go back to the Boy Scouts.\n\nNaugle\u2019s extended family is divided on the subject of his work. His parents, having left the Church themselves, are supportive. \u201cMom takes every chance to brag,\u201d he says. She is skilled at finding subtle segues into conversations about faith so that she can bring up her son: \u201cEvery time she gets in an Uber, she\u2019ll ask someone what their religion is.\u201d Some members of his extended family disapprove \u2014 \u201cthey think I\u2019m Satan incarnate\u201d \u2014 but they never mention it, and they tell their children not to mention it.\n\nWhen Naugle\u2019s family was finally removed from the records, it seemed like everyone in his community was suddenly aware of their decision. \u201cOur neighbors all knew. Our teachers, our family, our extended family, our friends,\u201d Naugle recalls dispassionately. The family felt shunned. \u201cIt was a pretty terrible process, to the point that as soon as my parents got the chance to leave Utah, they were gone. I basically did the same, and my younger brother as well. He would rather never return. It was a really bad experience, so that\u2019s kind of why I do this: to let people leave without having to go through that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at the time, I was just done, and needed it to be done.\u201d\n\nNaugle estimates that he has processed over 40,000 requests so far. There are sites that provide instructions for Mormons to submit their own letters \u2014 many former Mormons in r/exmormon have had success doing so \u2014 and Church spokesman Daniel Woodruff says the simplest way for a person to remove their name from Church records is to write to their bishop with their request to leave. But just as vh65 didn\u2019t want to risk anyone from her community seeing her leaving Ken Sanders Rare Books in the \u201880s, many Mormons fear the social repercussions of approaching their bishops with their requests. Naugle\u2019s involvement adds a layer of legal authority between users and the Church, preventing the battery of outreach attempts that upset Naugle as a teenager.\n\nSometimes the Church does contact loved ones of people who have put in resignation requests. Evan Lloyd left the Church last year, and he says that after he\u2019d submitted his resignation request through QuitMormon, the Church began contacting his wife instead.\n\n\u201cThey were kind of circling around her, making sure that she was good and she was still gonna be an active member of the Church,\u201d Lloyd says. He had told his wife he wanted to leave the Church, but he hadn\u2019t told her that he planned to remove his records. \u201cShe was caught by surprise when the Church started calling her. I probably should have communicated that a little bit better.\u201d\n\nLloyd\u2019s remorse suddenly gives way to conviction: \u201cBut at the time, I was just done, and needed it to be done.\u201d\n\nNot everyone in the ex-Mormon community has requested name removal. When we first speak, Joseph still hasn\u2019t. He says he refrained at first because his wife wasn\u2019t ready, then because he heard that removing your name from Church records can make it difficult to get your transcripts from Church-affiliated schools like Brigham Young University. (Joseph spent a semester at Brigham Young University-Idaho. A few years later, he got his associate degree at LDS Business College.) Having now earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree from the University of Utah, which is secular, Joseph is less concerned about accessing his transcripts, but there\u2019s still something keeping him from submitting his request. \u201cI think there\u2019s really nothing holding me back other than just a little bit of... I guess you could call them butterflies.\u201d\n\nvh65 still hasn\u2019t removed her name, though she did request \u201cno contact\u201d from her bishop. (\u201cI had moved, and I hadn\u2019t had anything to do with Mormonism for almost a decade, and somehow people from my work showed up at my door.\u201d) She worries that by removing her name from Church records, she would upset her mother. When I ask her if she ever feels disingenuous, moderating r/exmormon without being, officially, an ex-Mormon, she pauses for a second before answering. \u201cOriginally I just wanted to resign,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to be separated completely, but how can I do this without hurting my mom, who I really care deeply about? And then I realized that I spend all my time on this subreddit, and I\u2019m fascinated with Mormon history. It\u2019s my culture, it\u2019s my tribe, and even if I resign, it\u2019d still be part of who I am.\u201d\n\nMost of the former Mormons I spoke to craved immediate cathartic closure, like Evan Lloyd. Sometimes, even with Naugle\u2019s streamlined process, they weren\u2019t able to get it.\n\nThey watched \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 \u2014 porn shoulders everywhere \u2014 without shame\n\nOne couple in Missouri, Josh and Jaimie, decided to leave the Church last year after they both read Runnells\u2019 CES letter. By the time Jaimie read it, Josh had been ready to leave the Church for some time. He had reached out to a friend of theirs whom they suspected had already left the Church. (Jaimie had noticed that the man\u2019s wife was wearing tank tops and showing \u201cporn shoulders\u201d on Facebook.) The man had pointed Josh to QuitMormon, so he was ready to put in their requests as soon as Jaimie wanted to leave.\n\nJosh and Jaimie had resigned themselves to helping their children remain in the Church if they wanted to, and they explained their decision to their children in turn. Their eldest daughter, then 11, had already been baptized, and she chose to leave with them. They put in another QuitMormon.com request. Their youngest two children didn\u2019t care much one way or another but were glad to have their Sundays free. When they asked their eight-year-old daughter whether she wanted to remain in the Church, she told her parents that she wanted to experience what her older sister had experienced during her baptism. Josh and Jaimie froze somewhere between puzzlement and support. The eight-year-old went on. \u201cI wanna see what it\u2019s like to be dunked,\u201d she said. He and Jaimie unfroze, relieved.\n\nJaimie and Josh began to move on from the Church. They no longer went to church or tithed. They watched Game of Thrones \u2014 porn shoulders everywhere \u2014 without shame. They had never clicked with the majority of their ward, which Jaimie says is \u201cvery Molly Mormon.\u201d Some of the friends they had made began to drift away, and they let them.\n\nJosh and Jaimie assumed their unbaptized children\u2019s names had been removed from Church records when their own QuitMormon requests were processed. Then Jaimie got a call from a sympathetic friend who is still active in the Church. The friend told her that their unbaptized eight-year-old daughter was listed as the head of household in Church records, along with a \u201cmembership record number\u201d issued to babies when they\u2019re blessed. The Church had removed Josh and Jaimie\u2019s names, as well as their older, baptized daughter\u2019s names, but their other two unbaptized children\u2019s membership record numbers were still listed, as was the family\u2019s contact information.\n\nThe Church calls records of unbaptized children whose parents have requested name removal \u201ccanceled records.\u201d Church spokesman Woodruff says that while the names of children who are immediately related to a member of the Church will still appear in Church records as part of that member\u2019s family unit, they will not have individual membership records. He also says that canceled records are not accessible to bishops.\n\nNaugle says the Church has only recently begun removing the names of unbaptized children. For a while, he was considering a class action lawsuit. \u201cThey\u2019ve told my clients that a child on the record, who is not baptized, is removed when their parents are removed. But we know that\u2019s not the case because people, at the local level, still keep showing up for these kids, bringing them cookies, asking them to come to church.\u201d The good neighbor becomes tiresome.\n\nJosh and Jaimie say they were able to reach out to their bishop, with whom they\u2019re on friendly terms, to ask him to remove their contact information. The bishop said he couldn\u2019t remove their children\u2019s names. They turned to Reddit and saw that another couple had sent the Church a letter threatening legal action if their children\u2019s membership numbers were not removed. They received confirmation that the certified letter they sent to the Church had been received, but they still don\u2019t know whether their children\u2019s names have been removed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my kids\u2019 information. They\u2019re minors. This cannot be legal. I feel like they\u2019re counting those kids as members,\u201d Jaimie says. \u201cAt conference, they don\u2019t say whether they\u2019re only counting baptized members, or whether they\u2019re counting people with record numbers as well, which would be these little kids.\u201d (Woodruff says that neither name removals records nor canceled records are included in membership counts.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt that as long as I\u2019m alive and have a law license and can do this, I will\u201d\n\nNaugle has encountered other specious bureaucratic roadblocks in his work. Last year, the Church claimed that fraudulent requests for resignation were being submitted to QuitMormon, and Naugle was required to add an identity verification step to his process. Now clients submit government-issued identification along with their requests. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was an invalid concern,\u201d Naugle says serenely. \u201cTechnically, anyone probably could\u2019ve gone on, if they have enough information about a person, and asked to remove their name, and faked their signature. I doubt that it happened. There was one instance where someone submitted a false request for the Prophet of the Church, which I caught.\u201d The culprit had confessed to Naugle, and Naugle had alerted the Church himself.\n\nLate last year, the Church asked that all resignation requests from QuitMormon go directly through Kirton McConkie, the law firm that represents the Church. Previously, Naugle had sent requests to the Membership Records department. Now he emails resignation letters directly to Daniel McConkie, a shareholder in the firm. \u201cThey received over 6,000 emails in a six-week time period. I don\u2019t think they realized that was what was going to happen,\u201d Naugle says, not without amusement.\n\nLast week he received a letter from Daniel McConkie. \u201cWe regret to inform you that our current arrangement with you for processing of requests to remove names from the membership records of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is not working and will therefore be discontinued,\u201d the letter began. McConkie admonished Naugle for submitting duplicate requests, requests from people whose names have already been removed, requests from deceased or faithful members, and incomplete requests. \u201cThe problem is that your automated, largely impersonal system does not truly screen for fraudulent or erroneous submissions,\u201d the letter continued. QuitMormon users will now have to upload notarized, written requests as well.\n\nWhen we discuss the new requirement on the phone, Naugle sounds copacetic, if a little tired. This latest hurdle will necessitate an open call for notaries nationwide on r/exmormon. Naugle is not a notary, and even if he was, he would not be able to notarize requests for his own clients. Many people have volunteered to help him manage the site in the past: Evan Lloyd says he\u2019s reached out and offered his services, and there are legions of Redditors ready to volunteer. But Naugle rarely deploys helpers.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s as reliable as yourself,\u201d he says, \u201cand this is very sensitive, confidential stuff, too, so I don\u2019t really feel comfortable just sending an email to a random person that I met on the internet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s as though QuitMormon is Naugle\u2019s answer to the occupational callings Mormons receive from the Church. I ask Naugle when he plans to move on from QuitMormon. \u201cI guess when I\u2019m dead,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that as long as I\u2019m alive and have a law license and can do this, I will.\u201d\n\nThe time since Joseph left the Church has been marked by small milestones. He deleted his social media accounts, not wanting to risk getting sucked back into his old circles. He worried about \u201ccoming out\u201d as an ex-Mormon on social media. He was particularly concerned that the people he met on his mission, the long trips Mormons take to share the gospel, would reach out to him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually kind of liberating, knowing that I don\u2019t have to be worried about what Sister Smith has to say about my tattoo,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I want to show somebody, I can show the anonymous friends on Reddit.\u201d\n\nIn April, Joseph tells me that while he still wasn\u2019t ready to remove his name from Church records yet, he was getting closer to submitting his QuitMormon request. \u201cI think it\u2019ll happen when I\u2019m at peace with myself and the decision to leave. I think that\u2019s also when I\u2019ll unsubscribe from r/exmormon.\u201d\n\nA month later, Joseph emails me to tell me that he\u2019s decided to submit his name removal request. He says he\u2019s been spending a lot less time on the r/exmormon subreddit. \u201cI went from looking at it daily, probably every few hours \u2014 and spending a long time in the chats \u2014 to a casual scroll through every few days,\u201d he says. \u201cI just went on vacation with my family, and it felt good to be there with them, and not speak a word about the Church or obsess over who has what calling.\u201d\n\nMany former Mormons wean themselves off r/exmormon after a time. vh65 tells me that the subreddit\u2019s founder, Measure76, now rarely posts. Jaimie and Josh continue to turn to r/exmormon for support. Jaimie recalls how accommodating their first ward was when she was a new mother and Josh was busy with work. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have done without that community, from the first second we got there. Even though they didn\u2019t know us, that community was so wonderful,\u201d she says, a little wistfully. \u201cBut it\u2019s nice to at least have a community online that\u2019s kind of akin to it, where you can have each other\u2019s backs, and cheer each other on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on that subreddit a lot because it sucks. It sucks so bad,\u201d Josh says of leaving the Church. He often tells Jaimie he wants to spend less time on the subreddit \u2014 they\u2019ve wondered whether the subreddit is its own sort of religion \u2014 but then he\u2019ll see a message from someone struggling with the decision to leave.\n\n\u201cEvery day there\u2019s a new person on there like, \u2018What do I do? How do I handle this?\u2019 I served a mission for three months for the Church, finished, had fun for three months, and got sent home. I\u2019ve done more missionary work against the Church in the nine months we\u2019ve been out.\u201d\n\nIn his article in Ensign magazine, Adam Kotter wrote that the internet leads to questions and doubts by exposing Mormons to \u201cideas that challenge their beliefs.\u201d But if the internet is inherently threatening to the Church, or to any faith, it\u2019s perhaps not because of the way it affirms doubts. Rather, it\u2019s in the community it opens up \u2014 a community that can be just as close-knit and supportive as a ward. Where ChurchofJesusChrist.org offers scripture, the internet beyond the Church\u2019s domain shines light into what has historically been a black box: the lives of the people who have left.", "description": "Leaving a community isn\u2019t easy, but a subreddit and QuitMormon.com makes the process of leaving the Mormon Church (officially the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) simpler and more human", "authors": ["Lauren Larson", "Jul", "Photography Kim Raff"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xBQXViFg_neg-ELuME7yuPU_6Sg=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/17874038/VRG_ILLO_3462_003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-01"}
