General Assembly", "language": "en", "text": "The U.S. and Saudi Arabia will press their case against Iran.\n\nUntil recently, speculation abounded that Mr. Trump would make history by meeting with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran. But the Sept. 14 attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, which American and Saudi officials blame on Iran, has made such a meeting unlikely at best.\n\nAmerican officials are expected to present what they have described as evidence that Iran carried out the attack with drones and cruise missiles. Iran has denied the accusation. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who are supported by Iran in their fight against a Saudi-led coalition that has been bombing their country for more than four years, have claimed responsibility.\n\nMr. Rouhani speaks on Wednesday, and he will almost certainly assert that Mr. Trump ignited the cycle of conflict by withdrawing last year from the 2015 nuclear agreement with major powers and reimposing onerous sanctions that are crippling its economy.\n\nThe United States is trying to build a coalition to deter Iran, even if it is unclear what form such deterrence would take. The General Assembly gives the administration an opportunity to \u201ccontinue to slow walk a military response in favor of more coalition-building and political and economic pressure,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nAt a climate change meeting, Washington will be absent.\n\nThe climate crisis is at the top of the General Assembly\u2019s agenda. About 60 heads of state plan to speak at the Climate Action Summit on Monday, and officials aim to announce initiatives that include net-zero carbon emissions in buildings.\n\nThe United States has no such plans \u2014 Mr. Trump announced in 2017 that he was withdrawing the country from the Paris Agreement on climate change. But some state governors who have formed the United States Climate Alliance said they would attend the summit and meet with other delegations.", "description": "Nearly 200 leaders will converge on the world\u2019s most prominent diplomatic stage for five days of speeches, hundreds of meetings \u2014 and clashes over climate change, Iran and trade.", "authors": ["Edward Wong", "Lara Jakes", "Michael Schwirtz", "Rick Gladstone"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/world/22unga-setup/merlin_87252802_bfc7b880-7f22-4bee-8612-ad74c786f84f-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
