The judge took the opportunity to attack two memos written by the Department of Justice, both of which maintain that a sitting president cannot be criminally prosecuted. These memos form the basis for the department\u2019s current policy of not indicting a sitting president in federal court.\n\nYet the judge left no doubt that he considered the memos\u2019 conclusions \u201cnot warranted\u201d \u2014 and that in his view, a president can be criminally investigated and perhaps even prosecuted while in office.\n\nThis is the first time a federal court has ever seriously raised the possibility that a sitting president could be criminally prosecuted. Although the judge\u2019s decision will certainly be reconsidered on appeal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \u2014 and very possibly by the Supreme Court \u2014 it needs and deserves serious attention on its own terms.\n\nIn a sense, Trump\u2019s lawyers opened the door for the judge to make his attack on the Justice Department memos. After the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office issued the subpoena as part of the state criminal investigation triggered by Michael Cohen\u2019s revelations, Trump sued the district attorney in federal court. The theory of his suit was that a sitting president must be treated as immune from all criminal investigation of any kind.\n\nThis radical theory goes well beyond anything the Supreme Court has ever said. Indeed, the closest Supreme Court precedents regarding subpoenas against the president strongly indicate that the president may be subjected to subpoena. In the 1997 Clinton v. Jones case, the justices held that a sitting president could be subject to civil lawsuits, which of course include plenty of subpoenas. And in the 1974 Nixon tapes case, the justices rejected Nixon\u2019s claim of presidential privilege to refuse to comply with subpoenas that were needed for a criminal investigation.\n\nBoth decisions emphasized the principle that the president is not above the law.\n\nIn order to buttress his argument, then, Trump couldn\u2019t really rely on judicial authority. So his lawyers emphasized the DOJ memos. One dates back to 1973, when the Watergate investigation was in full swing and Vice President Spiro Agnew was separately being investigated for tax fraud. The other dates from 2000, and was written in the aftermath of Clinton\u2019s impeachment.\n\nIt isn\u2019t terribly surprising that these memos, both issued by the Office of Legal Counsel in the DOJ, argue in favor of the president. The job of the OLC is to issue opinions on behalf of the executive branch about the president\u2019s legal and constitutional powers. As a result of its institutional position, OLC has traditionally taken a rather maximalist view of the extent of the president\u2019s powers relative to the other branches of government.\n\nThe core argument of the memos is that allowing a sitting president to be subject to criminal investigation or prosecution would impair the president\u2019s ability to do his job well. Consequently, the memos reason, the Constitution should be interpreted to protect the president from such investigation or prosecution. The primary emphasis of the memos is federal criminal investigation. Technically the question of state criminal investigation is a little different. But if the main constitutional concern is making sure the president can perform his duties without the interference of a criminal investigation, it would make sense to extend the memos\u2019 logic to state investigations and prosecutions, too.\n\nMarrero\u2019s first salvo was to point out that these memos aren\u2019t law \u2014 even though we sometimes imagine they are. The memos\u2019 theory \u201chas gained a certain degree of axiomatic acceptance,\u201d he wrote, as though \u201ctheir conclusion were inscribed on constitutional tablets etched by the Supreme Court.\u201d But an opinion by the Department of Justice is just that \u2014 an opinion, not a statement of law by a court. The memos \u201cdo not constitute authoritative judicial interpretation of the Constitution,\u201d the judge wrote.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A federal district judge in New York has held that the Manhattan district attorney may subpoena Donald Trump\u2019s tax records as part of a criminal investigation.Apart from the obvious political implications, there\u2019s something constitutionally significant about the decision by Judge", "authors": ["Noah Feldman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3KCzcnkQyys6RsPj9YbYAQ--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_opinion_268/c563be0ac079fa4593068be288edd549", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
