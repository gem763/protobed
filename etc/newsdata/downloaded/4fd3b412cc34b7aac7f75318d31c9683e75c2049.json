That means that you and I might get different offers, and I might even see different offers across my several different Amex cards. That adds a real benefit to having multiple Amex cards \u2014 even if you just use them to be eligible for more offers, you have a better chance of getting good ones.\n\nOne of the appeals of the Amex Offers program is that the offers continuously change. Offers can be for national brands, but are also targeted based on your billing address \u2014 for example, I have a few offers for shops and restaurants that have a New York City location.\n\nCurrent Amex Offers\n\nHere are some of the particularly interesting Amex Offers currently available.
