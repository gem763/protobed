He's so lucky it missed his legs,' he told The Courier Mail.\n\nHe was unable to tell what kind of shark it was but said he'd never seen anything like it despite surfing at the popular beach his whole life.\n\n'I'm sort of getting my head around to like, did that just happen,' Riley said.\n\nMr Highlands posted to a local Bribie Island Facebook group page to warn other surfers in the area.\n\n'Riley's shaken pretty bad but otherwise all is ok, stick to swimming in the pool for a few days could be the go,' he wrote.\n\nThe beach was not closed as the shark sighting had been reported to life savers after patrol hours.", "description": "Riley Brown, 17, was waiting for a wave in the line up at Bribie Island on Queensland when he was suddenly knocked off his board, on Thursday afternoon.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/06/19871750-0-image-a-52_1571377351321.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
