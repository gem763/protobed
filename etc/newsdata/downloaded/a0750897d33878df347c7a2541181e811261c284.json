He was speaking before a Monday afternoon Japan Skins made-for-TV exhibition with Rory McIlroy, Hideki Matsuyama and Jason Day.\n\nWoods is making his first appearance in Japan in 13 years, after being a regular visitor for the first decade of his professional career.", "description": "Tiger Woods on Monday declared himself \"right on schedule\" after recent knee surgery as he prepares to return to competition at this week's Zozo Championship following two months on the sidelines.", "authors": ["Andrew Both", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443218809&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K07N", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
