Christian Porter instructed Commonwealth prosecutors not to charge journalists under certain sections of Australia's secrecy laws without first obtaining his approval. Labor said the intervention was an important step for press freedom but media companies were so-far unconvinced. The initiative comes after press freedom concerns following AFP searches on a News Corp Journalist's home and at ABC offices in Sydney earlier this year.

That information should be publicly available because taxpayers need to know how they\u2019re money\u2019s being spent.\u201d\n\nABC news director Gaven Morris said Federal Police raids on his newsroom just days after another at the home of News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst were deliberately designed to intimidate whistleblowers and prevent them from exposing misconduct, corruption, or exploitation.\n\n\u201cThere was a message being sent to potential whistleblowers and it had a very potent impact,\u201d Mr Morris said.\n\n\u201cJournalists will have a second thought but then get on with their job. A whistleblower will have a second thought and turn the other way.\u201d\n\nNine group executive editor James Chessell said repercussions of the raids were already being felt, with one whistleblower telling a reporter they were \u201cfreaked out\u201d by the raids before withdrawing from a story.\n\nMedia Entertainment and Arts Alliance chief executive Paul Murphy said many other journalists told him \u201cthat they\u2019ve lost sources, that they\u2019ve lost stories\u201d after the action because whistleblowers felt threatened.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical to remember the role of whistleblowers \u2026 because if sources dry up, public interest journalism really struggles,\u201d he said.\n\nMORE NEWS\n\n\u2018Jason Bourne\u2019 defence of AFP raids\n\nAussie whistleblowers \u2018freaked\u2019 out\n\nCyber spy agency officer raided by AFP\n\nNews Corp corporate affairs, policy and government relations group executive Campbell Reid warned the increasing efforts by government officials to withhold information from the public could have a devastating effect at all levels of the community.\n\n\u201cThis place has the role of setting the example for the nation in terms of right to know,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis culture of secrecy resonates all the way down to directly touching people\u2019s lives in school communities.\u201d\n\nMr Reid said the Morrison Government needed to make urgent legal reforms to protect the public\u2019s right to information and to ensure freedom of the press in Australia.\n\n\u201cThere is now an opportunity to go back and look at those laws, take a breath, fresh set of eyes, and say actually several of these go too far,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a submission to the Inquiry, 14 media organisations argued for six main changes to protect public interest journalism, including the right to contest warrants against journalists and media organisations, protection for public sector whistleblowers, changes to Freedom of Information and defamation laws, limits for restricting government documents, and protection for journalists threatened with jail for doing their jobs.\n\nThe Senate Press Freedom Inquiry is expected to publish its findings in March 2020.\n\nThe report will follow a related inquiry by the Australian parliament which is due by November 28.", "description": "Australians are being robbed of their right to know about vital issues that directly affect them by \u201cculture of secrecy\u201d in the Australian government, and draconian laws which threaten whistleblowers and criminalise journalism, a Senate committee heard today.", "authors": ["Jennifer Dudley-Nicholson"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9b1e339562a66a7b73ba50a0ae309cb5?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
