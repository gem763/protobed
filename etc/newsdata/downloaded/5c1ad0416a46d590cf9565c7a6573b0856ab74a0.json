There were these explosions every few beats. You can't prepare yourself for that. It was horrendous.\n\n\"The fire was too big, there was absolutely nothing we could do.\"\n\nThe couple added that the crew members told them they fled when the fire grew out of control.\n\nThe Conception was owned by Truth Aquatics, a Santa Barbara-based company founded in 1974.\n\nCoast Guard records show inspections of the boat conducted last February and in August 2018 found no deficiencies. Earlier inspections found some safety violations related to fire safety.\n\nA 2016 inspection resulted in owners replacing the heat detector in the galley and one in 2014 cited a leaky fire hose.\n\nRecords show all safety violations from the last five years were quickly addressed by the boat's owners.\n\nOn Monday, Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat senator for California, called for an investigation into the incident.\n\n\"It's inconceivable that with all the safety regulations we have in place today, a fire on a boat can lead to the loss of life we saw this morning,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"We need to understand exactly how the crew was trained and, if they were awake and above deck, why they were unable to alert or help rescue passengers.\"\n\nTruth Aquatics referred questions about the accident to a joint media centre.\n\n\"This is still an ongoing search and rescue,\" it said.\n\nAgencies contributed to this report\n\nRead more\n\nRead more California boat fire: 33 people feared dead as boat bursts into flames\n\nEight confirmed dead as 29 missing from burning boat off California\n\nComedian Kevin Hart suffers 'major injuries' in LA car crash\n\nTrain 'derails following collision\u2019 in California, injuring 27\n\nPlane bursts into flames after aborted take-off at California airport\n\nHow to fly from the UK to California for \u00a3241 return", "description": "Twenty-five people have been found dead after a diving boat burst into flames off Santa Cruz Island, California, according to a Coast Guard official.Lieutenant Commander Matthew Kroll said nine people were still missing following the pre-dawn fire.", "authors": ["Conrad Duncan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XhtRj9KvD9oLnpuOIx3rRQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/ca90fba714d45806c1c30547658731f6"}
