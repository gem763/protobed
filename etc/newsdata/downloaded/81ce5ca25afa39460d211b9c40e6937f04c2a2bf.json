(Photo: Lynne Sladky, AP)\n\nA 12-year-old boy from Germany died at sea in Italy while on the MSC Divina earlier this week. He was traveling on a European cruise with his family at the time.\n\nRobin Roothans, a spokesperson for MSC Cruises, told USA TODAY that a family sought medical care for their child on around midnight on Monday.\n\nHe became ill as the ship sailed from Palermo, on the northern coast of Sicily, westward toward Cagliari, in southern Sardinia, and died at sea.\n\n\"While the staff of our Medical Center reacted promptly, the health status of the child unexpectedly deteriorated,\" Roothans said. \"Despite several attempts to resuscitate the child, he unfortunately passed away.\"\n\nMSC's website notes that its medical centers are all supervised by a ship's doctor and other medical personnel.\n\n\"The Medical Centre is open at the times advertised in the ship\u2019s Daily Programme. Emergency services are available round the clock by calling the Medical Emergency number. Excluding emergencies, medical services carry a fee and prices are available onboard. Guests who incur medical expenses during their cruise can ask their insurance company for reimbursement once ashore,\" the site states.\n\nAs of Thursday evening, MSC Cruises was still unclear on the cause and manner of the child's death. Roothans said the company is working with authorities in order to follow guidelines and facilitate any investigation or examination that may be required.\n\nShe added that MSC is working with embassy and consulate personnel \"to assist the family with the repatriation of the child as quickly as possible. We are offering our full support to the family at this extremely difficult time and a dedicated care team onsite is providing support and comfort.\"\n\nCruises: 10 of the most cringeworthy bad habits and how to break them\n\nDoing it for the 'gram?
