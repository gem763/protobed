(Image: CBS)\n\nHalloween offers so many opportunities for our favourite genre shows to play with the spooky, strange, and supernatural\u2026but it\u2019s also an opportunity for all these interesting storytelling elements to crash and burn.\n\nInstead of talking about the best examples of shows that made amazing choices with costumes and candy, we\u2019re counting down some of the worst Halloween episodes we\u2019ve seen on TV.\n\nThis list isn\u2019t an end-all be-all of horrible specials\u2014The Simpsons has so many good and bad \u201cTreehouse of Horror\u201d episodes that its spooky offerings could be its own list\u2014but it\u2019s a collection of some particular standouts.\n\nAnd they would\u2019ve gotten away with it too, if it weren\u2019t for this meddling blog.

Sadly, 2013\u2019s Scooby-Doo and the Spooky Scarecrow feels more like a ghost of what made the Scooby gang fun in the first place.\n\nThe plot of this direct-to-DVD special is the same as most Scooby-Doo episodes: a business is haunted by some guy dressed up as a ghoul...and he would have gotten away with it, if not for those meddling kids! But this interpretation is a bummer, bringing nothing new to the table except filming monsters on iPhones, ultimately turning a nostalgic, stoner-comedy property into a joyless slog. Ruh-roh.\n\nThe scariest thing is how dated it is. (Image: Comedy Central)\n\n4. South Park - \u201cGoth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers\u201d (2013)\n\nSouth Park has a history of well-written Halloween specials, which is maybe why \u201cGoth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers\u201d is such a letdown.\n\nThe basic premise is that the goths of South Park are being body-snatched and replaced by emos, and gothdom worldwide is under attack. You could see yourself laughing at the premise in the MySpace and LiveJournal days, right? When goth and industrial bands were replaced seemingly overnight by pop-punk acts like Hawthorne Heights, and teenagers started sprouting nautical star tattoos and ill-advised anime-protagonist bangs?\n\nOnly thing is: This episode aired in 2013. By then, the premise was stale and the writers didn\u2019t do much more with it, wasting some of the funniest characters in South Park, Colorado.\n\nWalk like an Egyptian. (Image: NBCUniversal)\n\n3. Hercules, The Legendary Journeys - \u201cMummy Dearest\u201d\n\nCamp \u201890s classic Hercules was not known for its historical accuracy or its storytelling finesse. Still, Halloween-themed episode \u201cMummy Dearest\u201d manages to fail on almost every level.\n\nEssentially, there\u2019s an Egyptian princess who is looking for an evil mummy. She asks Hercules to help her find the mummy, but Hercules is hesitant because she\u2019s extremely into him...and also, she owns slaves. Meanwhile, merchant huckster Salmoneous\u2014basically an antisemitic caricature come to life\u2014has purchased said mummy for his House of Horrors, but the mummy escapes and threatens to, I dunno, eat people?\n\nThe episode relied on bad stereotypes of Jewish and Egyptian people, and wrapped up with Hercules ending slavery in Egypt. White saviour, ahoy!\n\nWelcome to our spooktacular home. (Image: CBS)\n\n2. Star Trek - \u201cCatspaw\u201d\n\nThe Federation\u2019s utopia has seemingly evolved beyond Halloween and celebrations like it, so this episode of Star Trek feels random at best.\n\nThe crew is stuck on a haunted castle planet where a wizard and a cat-witch-lady threaten Captain Kirk with a magical USS Enterprise keychain. In a twist you could probably see from miles away, they\u2019re actually aliens disguised as sci-fi magicians. Space communists don\u2019t mesh with spooky terribly well, so Star Trek wisely never attempted a holiday special again.\n\nIncredibly, this script was written by Hugo- and Bram Stoker-award winner Robert Bloch, a well-regarded sci-fi, mystery, and horror writer who had a successful career spanning half a century; he started writing under the guidance of H.P. Lovecraft, and his 1959 novel Psycho was adapted by Alfred Hitchcock into perhaps the most important horror film of all time. Even the greats occasionally stumble.\n\nHey skeleton, you\u2019ve got a little something on your face. (Image: ABC)\n\n1. Teen Angel - \u201cI Love Nitzke\u201d\n\nOur number one spot goes to a series long forgotten. After the success of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, family-friendly supernatural comedies were all the rage\u2026for about three months in 1997. One of the worst attempts at copying the supernatural-family-sitcom Sabrina had mastered was the ABC series Teen Angel, in which high schooler Marty eats a six-month-old hamburger as a dare, then dies and comes back as a guardian angel for his best friend Steve.\n\nIn a series of comedic mishaps in \u201cI Love Nitzke,\u201d Marty fires a bunch of Cupid\u2019s arrows (nothing more Halloween than Cupid?) at Steve\u2019s mum, aunt...and his kid sister, who are now all infatuated with Steve\u2019s ultra-conservative driver\u2019s ed teacher, Mr. Nitzke.\n\nThe jokes from Mr. Nitske, a Breitbart article come to life, were bad even then: \u201cBefore you, there was only one woman in my life: America. And I had to share her with immigrants!\u201d, Mr. Nitzke told Steve\u2019s mum as they slow-danced. How romantic!\n\nThe Halloween dance is eventually saved\u2014and I am not making this up\u2014by God\u2019s cousin Rod, played by Ron Glass of Firefly fame, who appears as a dancing paper skeleton, which is certainly a choice.\n\nThe concept of the show was weirdly morbid, so like its protagonist, Teen Angel was killed in its youth after only one season...thankfully not before blessing us with one of the worst Halloween specials of all time.", "description": "Halloween offers so many opportunities for our favourite genre shows to play with the spooky, strange, and supernatural\u2026but it\u2019s also an opportunity for all these interesting storytelling elements to crash and burn....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/idvscwbotwnkdkoqafkz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
