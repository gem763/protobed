The Bears won the NFC North last season but were heartbroken in the playoffs after kicker Cody Parkey missed the game-winner that would have thrust them into the next round. The Packers missed the playoffs and revamped the team in the offseason.\n\nThe Bears and Packers aren\u2019t the only storylines heading into 2019.\n\nThe New England Patriots are looking to defend their title and win their seventh Super Bowl, while the Kansas City Chiefs and New Orleans Saints are both looking for revenge after losing in their respective conference championship games last season.\n\nYou also have a team in the Cleveland Browns that have a ton of hype behind them after they made some major acquisitions in the offseason.\n\nThere are many interesting things to be focused on this season.\n\nRead on to get each team\u2019s outlook, their schedule and more tidbits of information prior to the start of the 2019 season.\n\nARIZONA CARDINALS\n\nHead coach: Kliff Kingsbury (0-0;
