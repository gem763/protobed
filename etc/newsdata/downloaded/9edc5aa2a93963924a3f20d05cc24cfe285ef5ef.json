But they insisted even more strongly they would not blink if Prime Minister Boris Johnson forces them to choose between scrapping the \"backstop\" provision on the Ireland border or accepting the economic harm of a no-deal scenario.\n\n\"There has been no change in our position on the matter,\" the European Commission's chief spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, visibly exasperated, said at a news conference in response to a question about potential willingness to change or abandon the backstop provision.\n\nCalling a no-deal departure \"a very distinct possibility,\" Andreeva said the Commission was still waiting for the British side to make proposals on alternatives to the backstop provision, which would similarly safeguard the integrity of the EU's single market.\n\n\"I can't report any concrete proposals having been made that we have seen,\" she said, in reply to a question about whether there had been any new idea put forward from London. \"We are not insisting now on having anything on paper,\" Andreeva added hopefully. \"It can be digital as well.\"\n\nProtecting the single market is of such paramount importance that EU leaders have long said they would sooner suffer the brutal consequences of a no deal than allow a breach.\n\nIt is a point that many British officials have been reluctant to accept, but one that the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, reiterated in an op-ed in the Sunday Telegraph this week.\n\n\"On the EU side, we had intense discussions with EU member states on the need to guarantee the integrity of the EU\u2019s single market, while keeping that border fully open,\" Barnier wrote. \"In this sense, the backstop is the maximum amount of flexibility that the EU can offer to a non-member state.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Commission is expected to approve a proposal that would give EU27 countries access to up to \u20ac500 million a year in disaster money to help cope with the economic fallout of a no-deal scenario \u2014 funds typically used for natural catastrophes like forest fires.\n\nAuthorizing a legal basis for use of the emergency funds would be among the final components of the EU's extensive contingency plans, and it underscores the increasing pessimism in Brussels that it will be possible to negotiate an orderly departure by the U.K. before an October 31 deadline.\n\nThe backstop, which Johnson's government has targeted as the main obstacle to an accord, is designed to safeguard the EU's single market by requiring the U.K. to adhere to EU customs rules in the event that negotiators fail to achieve a new free-trade agreement by December 31, 2020. That date marks the end of the stand-in-place transition period called for in the Withdrawal Agreement, which the U.K. parliament has refused to ratify.\n\nDespite the prospect of emergency legislation in Westminster on Wednesday to prevent a no-deal Brexit, EU officials and diplomats said that hope of a further delay in the deadline had largely evaporated since Johnson took office as prime minister on July 24.\n\n\"It seems we\u2019re stuck,\" one EU diplomat told POLITICO on Tuesday. \"But I would not call it a surprise.\"\n\nJohnson has pledged to steer the U.K. out of the EU on October 31 \"do or die\" but told MPs on Tuesday of his optimism that a deal can be done. \"Our friends and partners are increasingly seeing the possibilities of an agreement,\" he told the House of Commons.\n\nBut with British society, and its parliamentarians, still bitterly divided over how, or even whether, to leave the EU, and no consensus on what type of relationship to seek after Brexit, Johnson's expressed optimism is not shared in Brussels. \"It's very difficult to see how we can find a way out of this,\" one EU official said.\n\nMost EU officials long ago gave up on the possibility that the House of Commons could find a majority for any concrete proposal on Brexit. And EU officials have also for the most part long dropped any expectation of a second referendum.\n\nThere is also no expectation that a new national election in the U.K. will resolve the country's deep political divisions. On the contrary, EU officials fear that a divisive election campaign, likely to entail a furious barrage of anti-EU rhetoric from pro-Brexit forces, will only deteriorate relations further and make any post-election talks all the more difficult.\n\nEU officials and diplomats said that London was making a grave miscalculation by presuming that the EU viewed a no-deal departure as the worst possible outcome, and therefore would take action to prevent it.\n\nThey said the bloc's willingness to stand firm was based on broad consensus among economic analysts and other experts that the damage of a no-deal scenario would be far more acute in the U.K. than the EU27, which would remain a combined market of 440 million people while the U.K. and its 60 million people would be cut off from its closest and most important trading partners.\n\nThe U.K. government's own analysis has predicted dire consequences in Britain, potentially including food and medicine shortages. And from the EU perspective, that makes it virtually certain that most of Brussels' major priorities included in the Withdrawal Agreement will ultimately be accomplished anyway, as the U.K. seeks to escape from the hardship of a no-deal scenario.\n\nOfficials will demand that the EU's priorities of the financial settlement, citizens' rights and Ireland are dealt with before talks can progress to a trade deal.\n\nIn the meantime, EU diplomats say there is no prospect of the bloc dropping its brightest of red lines, the backstop, as Johnson has demanded.\n\n\"The backstop is essential,\" said one diplomat, adding that British officials demanding a fudge were refusing to face reality.\n\n\"That's like asking can you be a bit pregnant,\" the diplomat said. \"The rules of the single market are the rules of the single market.\"\n\nAt the same time, EU officials have expressed anger at assertions by U.K. ministers \u2014 including Johnson himself \u2014 that the backstop is \"anti-democratic\" because the U.K. would be required to follow EU customs rules while no longer having a say in making those rules.\n\nThe EU officials note that the Withdrawal Agreement included provisions for a joint committee and other governance measures that would give the U.K. input. And they reiterated that the backstop was always intended only as an emergency, temporary stop-gap until a trade agreement was either completed or close enough for provisional application. In the meantime, the officials point out that polls show most people in Northern Ireland support the backstop.\n\nBarnier and other EU officials have said the current Withdrawal Agreement already calls for efforts to find alternatives to the backstop once the transition period begins. But despite Johnson's pledge to replace the backstop, his government has not yet come up with any alternatives.\n\n\"So far we haven't heard any concrete proposal for these alternative arrangements,\" said one EU diplomat, adding: \"We're not restarting negotiations.\"", "description": "EU officials say safeguarding the bloc\u2019s single market is worth economic pain of a crash-out.", "authors": ["David M.
