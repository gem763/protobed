Part of the donburi (rice bowl) branch of Japanese cuisine, oyakodon consists of chicken and egg served over rice, with a sauce that\u2019s both savory and sweet tying the whole thing together.\n\nBecause of how popular it is, oyakodon is one of the most common items on Japanese restaurants\u2019 lunch menus. Even the most fundamental ideas had to start somewhere, though, and so we found ourselves wondering: what was the first restaurant in Japan to offer oyakodon? We were happy to find the answer, and even happier when we found out that not only is it located in Tokyo, it\u2019s still in business.\n\nTamahide is in downtown Tokyo\u2019s Ningyocho neighborhood, and its entrance looks sort of like a castle or samurai estate. That\u2019s fitting, though, since Tamahide was founded in the 10th year of Japan\u2019s Horeki, or 1760 by Western reckoning, when Japan was still ruled by the Tokugawa shogunate dynasty.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until over a hundred years later, though, that Tamahide began officially serving oyakodon. See, the restaurant was started as, and still remains, a hot pot specialist, with shamo (gamecock) hot pot being its premiere dish. However, in the late 1800s, the wife of Tamahide\u2019s fifth-generation owner noticed how some diners would take the last remaining remnants of their hot pot, pour it over a bowl of white rice, and mix it with egg. Figuring that if customers liked it enough to make it themselves, the restaurant may as well save them the trouble, and in 1891, the 20th year of the Meiji era, Tamahide\u2019s chefs prepared their first oyakodon.\n\nIn the modern era, Tamahide divides its dining into two floors, with oyakodon on the ground level and hot pot, set meals, and full courses on the second. Being an important part of Japanese culinary history, there\u2019s often a line, and we ended up waiting about 15 minutes for a seat when we stopped by at around 1 p.m. on a weekday afternoon.\n\nA menu board out front lists the myriad oyakodon options, and customers are asked to place their order and pay for a meal ticket before being seated. Figuring that if we\u2019d come all the way to the birthplace of the oyakodon, we may as well splurge for the top-of-the-line example, we settled on the 3,000-yen oyakodon that the restaurant calls the \u201cGokui.\u201d\n\nEventually we were ushered inside and a waitress brought us some green tea and also a cup of chicken broth. The broth was flavorful and had a clean finish, but as we waited for our oyakodon itself, we started to feel a little nervous. After all, you can get oyakodon in cheap Tokyo restaurants for 1,000 yen or less, so Tamahide\u2019s Gokui is a pretty big step up in price.\n\nBut like we said, you pay in advance at Tamahide, so there was no chickening out now. We sipped a little more broth, and before long the server returned with our oyakodon, which was hidden inside a bowl topped with a beautiful lid.\n\nSince oyakodon is made with chicken and egg, the primary color impression is usually yellow. When we took the lid off, though...\n\n\u2026we saw that the Gokui shines as a sea of gold, glistening under the restaurant\u2019s interior lights like a beacon signaling our stomach.\n\nFor its meat, the Gokui uses high-quality Tokyo shamo, and you get three different cuts: breast, thigh, and tender. Grasping a morsel in our chopsticks, we took a bite and were greeted with a texture with an ever-so-slightly firm outer edge and amazing tenderness underneath, producing a delicious, juicy sensation as we chewed.\n\nThe egg has a melty consistency that wraps around your tongue, providing a wonderful accompaniment to each mouthful of chicken or rice.\n\nCustomers ordering the Gokui also get a special treat that\u2019s exclusive to the top-tier oyakodon, in that it comes with another egg, this one from the ukkokei (Silky Fowl) breed, that you can dip the chicken in for even more rich decadence.\n\nSo in the end, is the Gokui worth its eye-popping price? We\u2019d have to say yes. Sure, it\u2019s outside our everyday lunch budget, but it\u2019s also one of the best oyakodon we\u2019ve ever had, plus a piece of edible history, and if 3,000 yen is still a bit too much for you, its less expensive oyakodon start at 1,800 yen, which will save you a little cash if you\u2019re also looking to hit up Japan\u2019s oldest tempura restaurant, which is also in Tokyo and still in business, for dinner.\n\nRestaurant information\n\nTamahide / \u7389\u3072\u3067\n\nAddress: Tokyo-to, Chuo-ku, Nihonbashi Ningyo-cho 1-17-10\n\n\u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u4e2d\u592e\u533a\u65e5\u672c\u6a4b\u4eba\u5f62\u753a1-17-10\n\nOyakodon served between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.\n\nWebsite\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- What\u2019s really for breakfast? 20 Japanese people give us a peek at their morning meal\u3010Photos\u3011\n\n-- Japanese fast food chain Nakau now has a fancy new chicken and rice bowl, with TRUFFLES\n\n-- Anime fan stumbles across the recipe for Dragon Ball Z Parent and Child Rice Bowl\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/02/this-is-japans-oldest-oyakodon-chicken-and-egg-rice-bowl-restaurant-and-its-awesome/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "It\u2019s hard to find a Japanese dish with a broader appeal than oyakodon.
