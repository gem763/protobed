What began as protests against a bill that would have allowed extraditions to the Chinese mainland have ballooned into a fight to uphold democracy in the city, and protesters have called for Lam\u2019s resignation, alongside other central demands.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Lam made the comments at a closed-door meeting last week and said she had wreaked \u201cunforgivable havoc\u201d on the semiautonomous Chinese territory by putting forth the bill.\n\n\u201cIf I have a choice,\u201d she said in English as she fought back tears, \u201cthe first thing is to quit, having made a deep apology.\n\n\u201cSo I make a plea to you for your forgiveness.\u201d\n\nShe added that she had \u201cvery limited\u201d capacity to restore peace to the territory because the issue had escalated into a national security situation for China that was beyond the capacity of her local government\u2019s abilities.\n\n\u201cThe political room for the chief executive who, unfortunately, has to serve two masters by constitution, that is the Central People\u2019s Government and the people of Hong Kong, that political room for maneuvering is very, very, very limited,\u201d she said in the tapes.\n\nLam says China has \u2018absolutely no intention\u2019 of military intervention in Hong Kong\n\nShe also reassured those in the meeting that China had \u201cabsolutely no intention\u201d of deploying its People\u2019s Liberation Army, which in recent weeks has increased its presence along the Hong Kong border in the Chinese city of Shenzhen. She added that \u201cBeijing did not have a deadline\u201d for ending the protests in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cIt would be naive of me to paint you a rosy picture that things will be fine or [that] I have a deadline,\u201d she said, adding that the city would be celebrating China National Day on October 1, which commemorates the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, but with \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201csolemn\u201d modifications as not to further inflame tensions.\n\nDozens of military vehicles entered Hong Kong last week for what state media called a \u201croutine rotation\u201d of its officers stationed in Hong Kong.\n\nBut while China has signaled it is ready to use force if necessary, experts remain skeptical that Chinese military intervention in Hong Kong is imminent and say recent displays are part of a wider strategy aimed at intimidation and deterrence.\n\nRead more: China appears to be gearing up for a military intervention in Hong Kong, but experts say Beijing is most likely bluffing\n\nChina also reportedly struck down a plan by Lam to withdraw the extradition bill\n\nLam\u2019s statements appear to confirm a report by Reuters last week that said China blocked efforts by Hong Kong\u2019s government to withdraw the extradition bill from being debated. Lam announced that the bill was \u201cdead\u201d in July, but it has not been struck in its entirety.\n\ncaption A demonstrator throwing back a tear-gas canister during a clash with the riot police in Hong Kong on August 24. source Tyrone Siu/Reuters\n\nAccording to Reuters, citing testimony from Chinese and Hong Kong government officials, Lam suggested that giving in to at least one protester demand would ease demonstrations, though the Chinese government refused to budge on its position.\n\nOn Sunday, Chinese state media warned that the \u201cend is coming for those attempting to disrupt Hong Kong and antagonize China.\u201d It did not specify how it planned to end protests but said any threats to China\u2019s national sovereignty and security remained a bottom line for the country that \u201cmust not be crossed.\u201d\n\nProtesters over the weekend clashed with the police and blocked roads and disrupted train services leading to Hong Kong International Airport, forcing travelers to walk.\n\nLam at a press briefing on Tuesday local time did not deny that she made the remarks documented in the leaked tapes but said she \u201cnever tendered any resignation\u201d to China and repeated that she would not be stepping down in the face of intensifying protests.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s not going to be an easy path,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d rather stay on and walk this path, together with my team, and with the people of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nA recent independent survey found that Lam\u2019s approval rating had sunk to 24.6% in recent months and that popular trust in the Hong Kong government was at an all-time low.", "description": "Business Insider - In leaked audio obtained by Reuters, Lam said she had \"very limited\" capacity to quell protests, which China views as a threat to national security..
