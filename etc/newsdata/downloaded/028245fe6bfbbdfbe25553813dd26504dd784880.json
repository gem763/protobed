There was something missing,\u201d Reich said. \u201cWe talk about keeping an edge and obviously we didn\u2019t have that tonight from me on down.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the Colts\u2019 seven-game home winning streak is history, Oakland (2-2) has its first road win in the series since 2001 and Indy will spend this week searching for answers.\n\nWhat went wrong? What didn\u2019t?\n\nSure, Indy again played short-handed. Their opening-day starters at receiver T.Y. Hilton, a four-time Pro Bowler, and Devin Funchess both missed the game with injuries. Receiver Parris Campbell left briefly in the second half with an abdominal injury and a fourth receiver, Chester Rogers, went to the sideline late in the fourth quarter after taking a big blow to his midsection.\n\nStarting running back Marlon Mack left with an injured ankle and the Colts (2-2) were also missing All-Pro linebacker Darius Leonard (concussion) and starting safety Malik Hooker (knee).\n\nBut they overcame a long list of injuries in last week\u2019s victory over Atlanta.\n\nThe difference: Execution.\n\nOffensively, the Colts were done in by a series of dropped passes, drive-killing penalties and turnovers. And defensively, they struggled to get off the field.\n\n\u201cI think when you look at the stat sheet, it wasn\u2019t about them it was about us,\u201d Brissett said, referring to the offense. \u201cWe had missed assignments - all 11 of us - penalties in critical situations. I think that was the deciding factor.\u201d\n\nEven Brissett was part of the problem.\n\nAfter the Colts cut the deficit to 24-17 and the defense finally forced a punt with 2:28 left, Brissett acknowledged he made a poor decision by throwing the ball to Zach Pascal as Raiders safety Erik Harris jumped the route. Harris snared the ball in front of Paschal and jogged 30 yards for a touchdown to make it 31-17.\n\nIt was the second costly turnover for Indy, which doubled its turnover total from the first three weeks combined. Campbell lost a fumble at the Raiders 15-yard line late in the first half.\n\nBrissett wound up 24 of 46 with 255 yards, three touchdowns and his second interception of the season while the Colts only rushed for 81 yards on 23 carries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain,\u201d Reich said when asked about the sloppiness. \u201cThat has not been indicative of our offense. We\u2019ve had very few drops, very few penalties and today was hard to swallow.\u201d\n\nThere also are concerns on defense.\n\nFor the second straight week, the Colts failed to generate a consistent pass rush and they couldn\u2019t stop the run.\n\nDerek Carr took full advantage.\n\nHe led the Raiders (2-2) to touchdowns on three of their first four drives and took Oakland on a 16-play, time-consuming drive to start the second half and extend the lead to 24-10. Carr finished 21 of 31 with 189 yards and two touchdowns on a day the ground game churned out 188 yards on 32 carries including a 60-yard TD run by receiver Trevor Davis in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cThere were a couple plays that should have been even bigger plays, to be honest,\u201d Carr said. \u201cWe felt bad as an offense for our defense. We shouldn\u2019t have had it that close for them.\u201d\n\nThe Colts, meanwhile, must find solutions before heading to Kansas City next week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt - last year and going into this year - that teams can\u2019t run the ball on us. We don\u2019t let teams run the ball,\u201d Reich said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to look at that and see what we can do better as coaches and players to have a better run defense.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Coach Frank Reich was stunned by the Indianapolis Colts' performance Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/raiders_colts_football_95633_c0-155-3699-2311_s1770x1032.jpg?0cb2908a967fe822b999438b55e5b4deb28f5d0c", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
