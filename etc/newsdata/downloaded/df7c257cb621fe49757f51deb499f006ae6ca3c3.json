The transmogrification is reflected in his paintings. While Hussain once painted the idyllic rural landscapes of his childhood, his artwork now depicts the reality of Kashmir\u2014a place of perpetual conflict, where normal life has been upended by death, forced disappearances, and the omnipresence of armed forces. The decades-long struggle between India and separatist militants has transformed Kashmir into the most militarized zone in the world. Gone are the flowing rivers and Himalayan mountains of Hussain\u2019s early art; a recent piece portrays a child with no eyes, invoking the victims of the Indian army\u2019s pellet-gun attacks last year.\n\nHussain is one of four artists profiled in Niyantha Shekar and Mukti Krishan\u2019s short documentary, Art in the Time of Conflict. The film, which premieres on The Atlantic today, also introduces Hina Arif, Zeeshan Jaipuri, and Mujtaba Rizvi\u2014young Kashmiri creatives whose artistic development was deeply influenced by the trauma of growing up in a war zone. Through their stories and art, they convey the human cost of the enduring conflict.\n\n\u201cWe were inspired by these artists\u2019 courage to resist, inform, and use the power of art to help deal with the trauma of living in a conflict zone,\u201d Shekar told me.\n\nTheir art, Krishan added, \u201cis a powerful way to resist social and political injustice,\u201d as well as a tool to witness and record history amid the constant threat of erasure.\n\nOver the course of four years, the filmmakers followed their subjects to meaningful places in the Kashmir Valley and observed them at work in their studios. \u201cWhile we kept a low profile, we were still stopped and questioned by the armed forces three different times during our filming,\u201d Shekar said, \u201cso our film\u2019s visual language, in part, was influenced by this difficulty of filming in the presence of armed forces.\u201d The directors resorted to filming the military from inside a moving auto-rickshaw so as to not be seen with the camera. \u201cAlmost every day of this project surprised us in how ever-present the symbols and memories of conflict are in the graveyards, streets, places of worship, and homes of Kashmir,\u201d Shekar said.\n\nShekar and Krishan would not be able to make a film like Art in the Time of Conflict today. Following the Indian government\u2019s recent abrogation of Article 370, which revoked Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s constitutional autonomy, there has been an unprecedented lockdown in the region. Beyond the thousands of people who have already lost their lives or suffered acutely as a result of the conflict, what\u2019s at stake now is further destabilization that could ripple beyond the region\u2014and, in a more abstract sense, the very definition of democracy.\n\n\u201cKashmir is the most dangerous and volatile place in the world,\u201d Krishan said. \u201cBy revoking the special status of Kashmir, India is courting conflict with Pakistan \u2026 If the neighbors attacked each other with a significant proportion of their growing nuclear arsenals, an estimated 125 million people could [be] killed.\u201d\n\nRecently, Krishan spoke with one of the crew members who helped film Art in the Time of Conflict. The young photographer, who still lives in Kashmir, sounded defeated. \u201cThere was a resignation in his voice,\u201d Krishan said. \u201cHe was fed up, and that he lost all motivation to create anything\u2014it wasn\u2019t worth it. He expressed skepticism at art\u2019s ability to bring peace.\u201d", "description": "Kashmiri artists process the trauma of living in the world\u2019s most militarized zone.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/10/Kashmir_2/video-featured.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
