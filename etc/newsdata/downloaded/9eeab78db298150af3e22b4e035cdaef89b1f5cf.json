(Getty)\n\nBritain is heading to the polls for the third time in five years after MPs voted in favour of Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a December general election.\n\nMPs backed the Prime Minister\u2019s Early General Election Bill by 438 to 20 after Jeremy Corbyn announced his support earlier on Tuesday.\n\nThe election will be held just 13 days before Christmas on Thursday December 12. A Labour amendment to push the date back to 9 December was rejected.\n\nParliament will now be dissolved at one minute past midnight next Wednesday, leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg confirmed, after which the parties will then begin campaigning almost immediately.\n\nJeremy Corbyn announced his support for the election bill on Tuesday morning. (Getty) More\n\nThe election means parliamentary scrutiny of the Brexit deal agreed by the Prime Minister last week will be temporarily abandoned, with campaigning taking precedence.\n\nMr Johnson, who was defeated in three previous attempts to call an election, had earlier declared the need for a \u201cnew and revitalised\u201d Parliament which is able to deliver Brexit.\n\nThe election bill was finally able to pass on Tuesday after Mr Corbyn backed down and announced that Labour\u2019s conditions to back the move had been met.\n\nThe Labour leader tweeted a video shortly after the result, saying now is the \u201ctime for change\u201d.\n\nThe General Election has just been called.\n\n\n\nIt's time for real change. pic.twitter.com/aiUwhxm5K6 \u2014 Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) October 29, 2019\n\nREAD MORE FROM YAHOO NEWS UK:\n\nMr Corbyn told his shadow cabinet the party would launch the \u201cmost ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen\u201d now a no-deal Brexit was \u201coff the table\u201d.\n\nLabour put forward amendments to give MPs the chance to bring in votes for 16 and 17-year-olds and EU citizens with settled status, but they were not selected to be voted on by Deputy Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle.\n\nA Number 10 source had warned that the Government would pull the Bill if the amendments to change the voting rules succeeded.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat could happen in an election?\n\nAs it stands, Mr Johnson may struggle to win a majority in the December General Election.\n\nThe Brexit Party is likely to try and hammer the Tories over Mr Johnson\u2019s pledge that he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than ask for an EU withdrawal delay beyond October 31.\n\nAfter two very shaky general elections, the Lib Dems have a new, untested, leader in the form of Jo Swinson but have been riding higher in the polls.\n\nThe SNP is also expect to perform well against the Tories in Scotland.\n\nIn 2017, Labour stormed back from 24 points behind in the polls to come close to drawing level with the Conservatives in the popular vote, but since then Mr Corbyn\u2019s image has been rocked by his stance on Brexit and rows over how he has handled allegations of anti-Semitism within the party.\n\nWhat does this all mean for Brexit?\n\nBrexit will certainly be the big flashpoint as the major parties have much more pointed policy stances than they did in 2017.\n\nThe Tories would be pushing the amended Withdrawal Agreement Mr Johnson secured with Brussels, which all wings of the party have, grudgingly, united behind.\n\nIf the Tories secure a majority Mr Johnson could push through his Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) \u2013 House of Lords willing \u2013 and under the so-called \u201cflextension\u201d agreed with Brussels the UK could quit the EU on December 31, rather than the currently scheduled exit date of January 31.\n\nThe European Parliament would also need to ratify the deal before the end of December for this to happen.\n\nLabour wants to renegotiate that deal and then put the result to a new referendum, and the Liberal Democrats seek to revoke Brexit without the need for a fresh national poll on the issue.\n\n\n\n---Watch the latest videos from Yahoo UK---", "description": "MPs voted 438 to 20 in favaour of the  Prime Minister\u2019s Early General Election Bill on Tuesday evening.", "authors": ["George Martin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B5lu_HdCBk1iVxgEBZb.UA--~B/aD0yMTk3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/1534f1e0-fa80-11e9-a5df-1ae927ddeb09", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
