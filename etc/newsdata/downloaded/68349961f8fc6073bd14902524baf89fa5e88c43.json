They instead used regular semi-automatic weapons. He challenged O\u2019Rourke to confiscate those arms as well.\n\nO\u2019Rourke told reporters afterward: \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to improve what we proposed, I want to make sure we\u2019re reflecting that.\u201d\n\nMost pistols and many rifles in the U.S. are semi-automatic.
