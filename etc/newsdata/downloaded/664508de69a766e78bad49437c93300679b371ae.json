Subscribe via Pocket Cast or iTunes.\n\nIncoming European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said Germany and other countries with healthy budget positions should look at ramping up investment to help their economies.\n\nThe comments continue a plea long made by Mario Draghi that governments need to step in to back up monetary support for the euro-area economy. Lagarde, who takes over from Draghi this week, said growth globally is \u201cprecarious\u201d and \u201cfragile.\u201d\n\nCountries with fiscal space \u201chaven\u2019t really made the necessary efforts,\u201d she told French radio RTL. \u201cWe are of course thinking of countries that have chronic budget surpluses like the Netherlands and Germany and a few others in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not use this fiscal surplus and invest in infrastructure,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy not invest in education, in innovation to have a better re-balancing in the face of current imbalances.\u201d\n\nAsked about negative interest rates, Lagarde said people must consider that growth could have been slower and unemployment higher without the ECB\u2019s monetary stimulus. She declined to comment on the outlook for monetary policy just yet.\n\nLagarde also said there \u201cisn\u2019t enough solidarity\u201d in the single currency area and there needs to be a shared budget.\n\nDraghi made a similar point at a speech at a farewell event in Frankfurt on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe need a euro-area fiscal capacity of adequate size and design: large enough to stabilize the monetary union, but designed not to create excessive moral hazard,\u201d he said. \u201cNational policies cannot always guarantee the right fiscal stance for the euro area as a whole.\u201d", "description": "Lagarde Takes Up Draghi\u2019s Plea for Fiscal Support in Europe", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB501DZ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
