Sometimes the best thing is just support him and be at his side and don\u2019t leave him alone. I think all other things, you have to be with him and when it\u2019s a hard moment you have to stay together, and as a group all we\u2019re going to do is support him and try to forget about it and hope he (is) not going to do the mistake again.\u201d\n\nCapitals coach Todd Reirden did not offer much when asked about Kuznetsov \u2014 a 27-year-old center who had a leading role getting Washington to the 2018 Stanley Cup, but whose production slipped last year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have a lot to say about this and I feel more comfortable talking about it after everything has been finalized with the decision the league\u2019s made,\u201d Reirden said.\n\nThe NHL tests for cocaine and other so-called \u201cdrugs of abuse,\u201d but usually does not discipline players for it. The league offers an education and counseling program for players, which Kuznetsov voluntarily entered after the IIHF announced his positive test and four-year ban from international competition.\n\nIn Kuznetsov\u2019s case, he previously denied ever using cocaine after a video leaked online that showed him in a hotel room next to a table with white, powdery lines on it.\n\nForward T.J. Oshie referred to a time he missed practice with the St. Louis Blues for an unexcused reason and received a two-game suspension from the team.\n\n\u201cI made mistakes in my past. I missed a practice once and, you know, got in some trouble and I addressed the team and sometimes it gets a little emotional, but I think Kuzy is a great guy,\u201d Oshie said. \u201cI think he\u2019s a good teammate and he\u2019s fun to play with. I sit next to him in the locker room during games. He\u2019s a good person so I don\u2019t think he has to say much to us. If he does, I think people will appreciate it, but he doesn\u2019t have to say anything to me, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nOther team leaders \u2014 captain Ovechkin and alternate captain Nicklas Backstrom\u2014 also said they didn\u2019t feel Kuznetsov needed to address the team in person to apologize.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d Backstrom said. \u201cI think he\u2019s smart enough to solve this on his own and with support from us, which I think he has 100%. So I just think we need to let him process this and do it his way.\u201d\n\nOvechkin said he called Kuznetsov as soon as he learned of his positive test and said to let him know if he needed help.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if we play together or play on a different team, I think we have a good relationship to support each other in different situations,\u201d Ovechkin said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
