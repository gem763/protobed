But the doctor paid no attention.'\n\nA statement by the medical experts added that the doctor, 'tugged the umbilical cord with real force' and that it was, 'like something from the Middle Ages'.\n\nMs Tepikina died after going into a coma in the Russian town of Nizhneserginskaya\n\n'The doctor on duty did not recognise the life-threatening complication of the birth.\n\n'As a result, medical help was provided with unacceptably huge delay.\n\n'The uterus was re-positioned only four hours 15 minutes later when the massive bleeding and the irreversible shock had already developed, along with heart failure.'\n\nThe doctor's mistakes, 'worsened the situation and caused the massive loss of blood, irreversible [and] complicated shock, heart failure and death of the patient', the experts alleged.\n\nSvetlana Malyukova, 42, mother of Ms Tepikina, had called for the doctor to be prosecuted.\n\nThe 42-year-old said: 'There were no apologies, nor attempts to contact us.\n\n'Soon after the tragedy I went to the clinic. I wanted to look into her [the doctor's] eyes. She asked: ''Why did you come?''\n\n'I did not notice a single sign of repentance\u2026She killed my child.'\n\nA travel ban has been imposed on the doctor who will face trial over Ms Tepikina's death.\n\nShe has already faced disciplinary action, say reports.\n\nMs Tepikina's baby, Anya, is now being raised by her mother and her husband Nikolay Tepikin, 22.", "description": "Alisa Tepikina died in 'excruciating pain' when a young female medic tried to remove her undelivered placenta  in the Russian town of Nizhneserginskaya.", "authors": ["Will Stewart In Moscow For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/08/19825372-0-image-a-19_1571298405529.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
