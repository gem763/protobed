Turki al-Malki, a Saudi military spokesman, said their initial investigations showed Iranian weapons were used in the weekend attack on the country's oil installations, but it was still determining where they had been launched.\n\nMissiles hit vital infrastructure at Khurais oilfield and Abqaiq petroleum processing plant - the world\u2019s largest - on Saturday, crippling production.\n\nA satellite image shows an apparent drone strike on an Aramco oil facility in Saudi Arabia Credit: Planet Labs More\n\nUS President Donald Trump had warned Tehran that the US was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d, though qualified that it would wait for a decision from ally Saudi on how to respond.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas, & in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies! (sic),\u201d Mr Trump tweeted.\n\nA mooted meeting between Mr Trump and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani at the United Nations later this month appeared off the cards after Tehran said it would not be happening and the US president called it \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nSaturday's attack halted production of 5.7 million barrels of crude a day, more than half of Saudi Arabia's global daily exports and more than 5 per cent of the world's daily crude oil production. Most of that output goes to Asia.\n\nAt 5.7 million barrels of crude oil a day, the Saudi disruption would be the greatest on record for world markets.\n\nMr Trump tried in vain to calm the markets, tweeting: \u201c\u201cPLENTY OF OIL!\u201d\n\nThe Houthis, a Shia group aligned with Iran fighting Saudi-backed government in Yemen, claimed responsibility for the attacks and warned \u201cour long hand can reach wherever we want whenever we want.\u201d\n\nHowever, experts and officials say it was unlikely to have been the militia, which they say lacks the capability to carry out such a highly orchestrated attack inside the kingdom.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t done by an amateur, to put it very mildly,\u201d tweeted Carl Bildt, co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations . \u201cIt was a massive and highly sophisticated attack.\u201d\n\nA US official told ABC news that said Iran launched nearly a dozen cruise missiles and over 20 drones from its territory.\n\n\u201cIt was Iran. The Houthis are claiming credit for something they did not do,\u201d they said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Saudi Arabia has claimed Iranian weapons were used in the attacks on its oil facilities though stopped short of blaming its arch-enemy directly, as crude prices hit record highs.", "authors": ["Josie Ensor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/P87XlS06HXo_m3nELzO9xg--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/25452c2e8c2a3079cbc32251911d9ea7", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
