In 2003, she published her first book, the bestselling illustrated novella The Man With the Dancing Eyes, followed in 2007 by Playing With the Grown-ups. She has published three cookery books and in 2010 presented BBC Two\u2019s cookery series The Delicious Miss Dahl. Her latest children\u2019s book, Madame Badobedah, illustrated by Lauren O\u2019Hara, is published by Walker Books on 3 October.\n\n1. Film\n\n\n\nCoco\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018A masterpiece\u2019: Miguel and dog Dante in the animated film Coco. Photograph: Pixar/AP\n\nI think we\u2019ve probably watched this about 15 times and it never loses its appeal. It\u2019s about Miguel, a young boy who dreams of being a musician. He ends up going to the land of the dead searching for his idol and meets someone who is connected to him. It\u2019s incredibly original \u2013 a masterpiece of a film. I love the music, I love the way it looks, I love what it says. I want that to be how death is. I cry the same way every time I see it.\n\n2. Book\n\n\n\nLove and Trouble: Memoirs of a Former Wild Girl by Claire Dederer\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Very insightful about sexuality and marriage\u2019: Claire Dederer.\n\nSo good. It\u2019s a memoir about growing up post-sexual revolution, pre-#MeToo and how the responses of the adults around Claire Dederer shaped her. So much is important: conversations around sex and consent and an adolescent\u2019s right to explore their sexuality and potency without adults thinking it\u2019s an invitation. It\u2019s also funny and smart and very insightful about womanhood, sexuality and marriage. It\u2019s a forensic examination of herself and her marriage, yet it doesn\u2019t feel in any way icky, like she\u2019s revealing too much. Its tone is really thoughtful and considered.\n\n3. Podcast\n\n\n\nS-Town\n\nWhen I had really big hip surgery, this became a beacon for me. It\u2019s like a real-life southern gothic novel, which I love. It\u2019s about John B [McLemore], a wonderfully eccentric guy living in a small town, which he calls \u201cshit town\u201d. It starts with one mystery but ends up somewhere totally unexpected. I felt very isolated after that surgery because I couldn\u2019t walk, but there was something about listening to John B and the connection he provided \u2013 it was something I treasured.\n\n4. Comedy\n\n\n\nAli Wong\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I love her honesty\u2019: Ali Wong in Hard Knock Wife. Photograph: Ken Woroner/Netflix\n\nI\u2019ve been watching a ton of Ali Wong on Netflix. I love everything she does \u2013 there\u2019s a fearlessness about her. I love how honest she is and her irreverence about motherhood, about sex, about working. The Baby Cobra special is totally brilliant. There\u2019s this quote that really sums up her comedy: \u201cGiving birth ain\u2019t nothing compared to breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is brutal. It is chronic physical torture\u2026 this savage ritual that just reminds you that your body is a cafeteria now. It don\u2019t belong to you no more.\u201d\n\n5. Musical\n\n\n\nHamilton\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Like some divine creation\u2019: Hamilton.\n\nLate to the party \u2013 I only saw it recently and it totally took my breath away. Between the writing and the music and the acting, it was like some divine [creation]... I\u2019m an atheist, but I thought: how did a person write this? I have become that middle-aged woman who listens to the Hamilton soundtrack in my kitchen. My husband thinks one of the reasons I\u2019m so obsessed with the music is that it has a kind of TLC R&B vibe and I\u2019m a child of the 90s. So my entire family mock me regularly for my Hamilton fandom.\n\n6. Album\n\n\n\nGiggs: Big Bad\u2026\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I love his humour\u2019: British rapper Giggs. Photograph: Dean Chalkley\n\nI\u2019m always either listening to Hamilton, which makes me cry, or Giggs, who makes me laugh. I love Giggs\u2019s humour, his lyricism \u2013 anyone who can put in the line \u201cShit\u2019s Madagascar/ When the monkeys made a poo scatter\u201d is my hero really. That\u2019s from the song Baby, which is my standout from Big Bad.... I listen to this when the kids are at school, so I either listen to it when I take the dog for a run or loudly in the kitchen when I\u2019m meant to be doing something that I\u2019m avoiding doing.", "description": "The author and former model on Ali Wong\u2019s irreverence", "authors": ["Kathryn Bromwich"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/748f9d08d11931429b92991b2d785961b54f8caf/408_161_1619_971/master/1619.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=575d09098b424a244ba3331077447319", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
