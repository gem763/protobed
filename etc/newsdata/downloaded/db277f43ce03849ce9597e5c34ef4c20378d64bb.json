They have put forward a bankruptcy proposal where the group of bondholders would pump $29.2 billion into the company to take control of it \u2014 and basically push the equity-holders out of the equation.\n\nOne important group representing the victims of the wildfires has made its allegiance known. It has sided with bondholders, under a plan in which $14.5 billion would go to those who lost homes, cars, and loved ones in the natural disasters.\n\nThe latest iteration of the saga will play out on Monday, when Judge Dennis Montali is set to rule on whether both plans would be able to move ahead. Below is a rundown of the funds that will be hanging on his every word.", "description": "At Monday's hearing, dozens of hedge funds will learn whether PG&E is taking the equity-holders' or the bond-holders' bankruptcy plan.
