The market is still a little sceptical,\" said Brian Lan, managing director at dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore.\n\n\"A few things are still hanging, including a no-deal Brexit. Time is ticking but not much progress is happening. The (situation in) Hong Kong is also not resolved.\"\n\nEquity markets gained after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet with China's top trade negotiator, while a White House official said the first day of talks had gone \"probably better than expected.\"\n\nWhile the two sides could reach some sort of agreements on aspects such as currencies and copyright protections, they were not expected to address the most contentious issues.\n\nAlso helping gold, the dollar, which has emerged as an alternative safe-haven during the trade war, was a shade weaker versus its rivals.\n\nOver to Brexit, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Thursday a deal could be clinched by end-October to allow the UK to leave the European Union in an orderly fashion, after what he called a very positive meeting with Boris Johnson.\n\nHowever, with just three weeks to go before the UK is due to leave the world's biggest trading bloc, it remains unclear on what terms it will leave or indeed whether it will leave at all.\n\nOn the technical front, support for gold was around the $1,486-$1460 an ounce level with resistance coming in around $1,520, OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said in a note.\n\n\"We would expect gold to find some support in Asia as traders hedge weekend risk. Otherwise, it will be a case of hurry-up-and-wait for the main event in Washington DC this afternoon and evening.\"\n\nInvestors will also keep a close eye on any cues from the U.S. Federal Reserve, with data on Thursday showing U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in September while underlying inflation retreated, supporting expectations the Fed will cut interest rates in October.\n\nIn other metals, platinum eased 0.1% to $898.83 an ounce, while silver rose 0.4% to $17.55.", "description": "Gold prices steadied on Friday, settling into a narrow range as investors awaited more clarity on global uncertainties including trade and Brexit, helping the metal shake off initial declines driven by hopes for a breakthrough in the U.S.-China talks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103779424-GettyImages-165651470.jpg?v=1570756843", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
