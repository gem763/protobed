Police were called by the ambulance service to Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, at about 1.40am today and found the bodies in the vehicle. It is understood 38 were adults and one was a teenager. The driver - a 25-year-old-man from Northern Ireland - was arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nIt is understood the lorry was registered in Bulgaria and entered the UK on Saturday at Holyhead - more than 300 miles from where the bodies were discovered near Thurrock. Watch a video of Detective Chief Constable Pippa Mills from Essex Police holding a press conference on the discovery and see the \"unorthodox route\" the lorry is believed to have taken before it was found.\n\nBrexit extension appears likely after Johnson and Corbyn meet\n\nBoris Johnson has met Jeremy Corbyn to discuss a possible timetable for the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, after the Government's proposed schedule was rejected last night in the House of Commons.
