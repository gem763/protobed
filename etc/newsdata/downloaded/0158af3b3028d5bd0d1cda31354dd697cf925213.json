Shares in Apple suppliers from Murata Manufacturing Co. and Alps Alpine Co. in Tokyo to AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong climbed after the report. An Apple spokesperson in Japan declined to comment.\n\nApple shares were up 2 per cent to US$225.16 at 9:38 a.m. in New York during pre-market trading.\n\nIt is not unusual for Apple to gradually ramp up orders as it gauges demand after launch and builds up to the holiday shopping season. The U.S. company has stuck with a previous projection for sales of up to 75 million new iPhones in the second half, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing internal estimates.\n\nBut Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has telegraphed strong initial sales of his company\u2019s most profitable product, spurring expectations that demand for the iPhone 11 will hold up despite global smartphone malaise. The CEO told French daily Les Echos on Friday he foresaw a new growth cycle in the market.\n\nMajor improvements to the iPhone\u2019s camera, including the addition of a new ultrawide lens for better architectural and tourist photos, alongside better battery life and improved durability may have resonated with consumers. And a decision to lower the iPhone 11\u2019s starting price by US$50, to US$699, may also have drawn in more budget-conscious consumers in a weaker global economy.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Sales have been better than expected, report says", "authors": ["Debwu", "Vlad Savov", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/iphone.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
