Readers pick the 21st century's best theatre and dance\n\nHamilton (2015)\n\n\u2018Best thing I have seen\u2019: Chris135\n\nI put off seeing Hamilton until a couple of months ago on the basis it would be over-hyped, preachy, woke and way too much money. Also the fear that if it was as good as rumoured, I would end up some annoying evangelical banging on about it constantly. It\u2019s the best thing I have seen in my life. If you haven\u2019t seen it: beg, steal or borrow the money and get a ticket.\n\nWind Resistance (2016)\n\n\u2018Heartbreaking\u2019: SueBriquet\n\nThe most beautiful, heartbreaking piece of theatre I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nThe Red Shoes (2016)\n\n\u2018Emotional and spectacular\u2019: Nomadteacher205\n\nMy favourite dance experience of the last decade. The first half was a slightly languid affair, but the second half was outstanding, emotional and spectacular in equal measure.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Spectacular \u2026 The Red Shoes. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\nFrankenstein (2011)\n\n\u2018Incredible\u2019: Ilovelamp\n\nThe Danny Boyle production of Frankenstein at the National theatre was incredible.\n\nThe Mother (2019)\n\n\u2018It should be there\u2019: Iron Mike\n\nThe Mother with Osipova should be there as should anything with the great Zakharova.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Natalia Osipova in The Mother. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\nTwo (Rise and Fall) (2001)\n\n\u2018Guillem looked like she was bathed in flames\u2019: Brightdayler\n\nPush is indeed fantastic, but I also love the solo Two, choreographed by Russell Maliphant in Two: Four: Ten. I was lucky enough to see both performed more than once. When I saw Two at the London Coliseum, during the more animated segments Sylvie Guillem looked like she was bathed in flames. It was one of the most stunning things I\u2019ve ever seen (along with the opening of the balcony scene in the Budapest Opera House\u2019s Romeo and Juliet).\n\nBook of Mormon (2011)\n\n\u2018Pretty damn fabulous\u2019: Deschain\n\nThe Book of Mormon was pretty damn fabulous, and deserves a place on this list.\n\nThe Book of Mormon \u2013 obviously. Nemo81\n\nWhat, no Book of Mormon?! YorkshireExPat\n\nKinky Boots (2012)\n\n\u2018Very poignant\u2019: Jen P\n\nKinky Boots is easy to dismiss as flippant, but it\u2019s a very poignant story dealing with a lot of deep issues, with heart and laughter, tears and great fun combined. Matt Henry as Lola was just incredible \u2013 Olivier and MBE very well deserved. I\u2019m not in London nowadays but made the trip to see this several times. I\u2019m very excited to catch it on tour next month, can\u2019t wait!\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Come from Away at the Phoenix theatre, London. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\nCome from Away (2013)\n\n\u2018Exhilarating\u2019: david100\n\nIt proved to be one of the most exhilarating nights I have ever spent in the theatre.\n\nto a simple, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll \u2026 song (2017)\n\n\u2018Hypnotic\u2019: cinephiliac\n\nMichael Clark\u2019s work was absolutely stunning. Its combination of precision and energy was a joy; I found it a wonderfully dynamic and hypnotic work.\n\nAvenue Q (2003)\n\n\u2018Our teachers whooped\u2019: Cardellina\n\nWe saw Avenue Q on a school trip and our English teachers whooped and clapped embarrassingly loudly after What Do You Do With a BA in English?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Avenue Q. Photograph: Kathy Willens/AP\n\nThe Lehman Trilogy (2013)\n\n\u2018Not sure I\u2019d seen anything like it before\u2019: RobRoy1975\n\nThe Lehman Trilogy was an impressive bit of theatre \u2013 not sure I\u2019d seen anything like it before.\n\nAfter The Encounter it was the best piece of pure storytelling I have seen this millennium. KentishTownie\n\nAbide With Me (2012)\n\n\u2018Has a piece of contemporary dance ever had a bigger audience?\u2019: NDL1234\n\nSlightly surprised that there is no mention of Akram Khan\u2019s Abide With Me at the London 2012 opening ceremony. Has a piece of contemporary dance ever had a bigger audience? Many of whom commented on just how moved they were by something they had not been exposed to before.\n\nThe B-Side: Negro Folklore from Texas State Prisons (2017)\n\n\u2018Very special\u2019: MGMacall\n\nA small but perfect piece of theatre by The Wooster Group, featuring Eric Berryman. This piece had a quiet stillness, spare set and the magnificent voices of Eric Berryman, Jasper McGruder and Philip Moore all coming together perfectly to bring to life the pain and pathos of work songs, spirituals, and toasts recorded in 1964 in Texas\u2019s then-segregated prison farms. It\u2019s a piece of theatre that exemplifies the very special and unique value of live performance.\n\nReasons to Be Cheerful (2017)\n\n\u2018Hilarious and poignant\u2019: freewheelingfrankie\n\nI loved Graeae Theatre Company\u2019s by turns hilarious and poignant Reasons to Be Cheerful, which did superb justice to most of Ian Dury\u2019s best songs and wove them into a rite-of-passage story that was much more than a contrived excuse for playing them.\n\nThe Flick (2013)\n\n\u2018Blew me away\u2019: dude1981\n\nThe Flick deserves its spot. Blew me away. Felt like I was seeing someone of my generation writing a play for someone like me.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Flick. Photograph: Joan Marcus\n\nThe Pillowman (2003)\n\n\u2018Hilarious and scary\u2019: Bacteria\n\nThe Pillowman by Martin McDonagh was the most enjoyable new play I saw this century. Hilarious, scary, constantly surprising and finally intensely moving. It screams out for a major revival.\n\nCounterpoint (2010)\n\n\u2018Thrilling, gorgeous and joyous\u2019: richardthomson\n\nShobana Jeyasingh\u2019s Counterpoint, performed in 2010 as a Cultural Olympics test event, filled the whole of the fountains area of Somerset House. Big-scale, fast, expansive, lovely patterns, lots of performances so easy to go and see; and above all, thrilling, gorgeous and joyous. There was a lot of good outdoor and site-specific dance all over London in 2010 and 2012. It feels like a different world now, never mind a different country. It will never happen again.\n\nGirl from the North Country (2017)\n\n\u2018So good I saw it twice\u2019: Thespionic\n\nGirl from the North Country is definitely one of the best I\u2019ve seen and certainly the best vocals/songs. So good I saw it twice!\n\nGirl from the North Country: obviously phenomenal songs but the staging, the singing and the whole shebang were incredible. AngryBairsteward2\n\nThe Bomb (2006)\n\n\u2018One of the best performances I\u2019ve seen\u2019: RubyGeegee\n\nIt was one of the best performances I\u2019ve seen anywhere, especially as the special audience Q&A afterwards, which we thought we may as well stay for, turned out to be between the playwright, the director, Jo Berry (whose father was killed by the Brighton bomb), and Patrick Magee, the Brighton bomber. The atmosphere in the tiny theatre was electrifying \u2013 you could have heard a feather drop.\n\nGangnam Style (2016)\n\n\u2018Electrifying\u2019: Ronan McDermott\n\nNo place for Ed Balls and Katya Jones\u2019 electrifying Strictly salsa to the music of Gangnam Style? For shame.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Following our selection of this century\u2019s best new plays and dance shows, readers give their suggestions \u2013 from Book of Mormon to The Red Shoes", "authors": ["Guardian Readers", "Rachel Obordo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ad540f9583b69bef01129394bd1e90c70218c09/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=13bdbba77f181e1c4163a4090f12c352", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
