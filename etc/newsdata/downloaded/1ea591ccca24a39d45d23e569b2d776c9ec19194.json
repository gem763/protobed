Yonhap via REUTERS\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - Ten workers at a South Korean port were injured after a fire broke out onboard two oil tankers, coastguard and fire officials told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nThe fire has now been largely put out, they added.\n\nAn explosion occurred on the Stolt Groenland, a 25,000-tonne, Cayman Island-flagged oil tanker, at the southern port of Ulsan at around 10:50 a.m. (0150 GMT), a coastguard official said.\n\nThere were 25 sailors aboard, including Russians and Filipinos.\n\nThe fire spread to another oil tanker docked nearby, the 9,000-tonne, South Korean-flagged Bau Dalian, with 21 aboard, he said.\n\nAll of the sailors on both ships were rescued, but 10 people, most of whom were workers at the terminal, were wounded, a fire official told Reuters. Nine of them were South Korean, including one in a critical condition, and the other was from India.\n\n\u201cThe fire has largely been put out but we are checking inside the vessels if there are any flames left or smoke coming out,\u201d the first official said.\n\nAny impact on the terminal\u2019s output or the surrounding environment appears minimal for now as the ships were at the port for repair, he added.\n\nThe Coast Guard is investigating the cause of the incident and police have blocked traffic in the area in case of a further blast, officials said.", "description": "Ten workers at a South Korean port were injured after a fire broke out onboard two oil tankers, coastguard and fire officials told Reuters on Saturday.", "authors": ["Hyonhee Shin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434857350&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0AN", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
