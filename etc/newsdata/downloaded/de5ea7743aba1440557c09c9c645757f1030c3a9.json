This will lead to some selling in the pound and the FTSE at the open after both enjoyed solid support over the past two weeks.\n\nMr Metcalfe estimates fair value for the pound is around $US1.37, with the steep discount due to ongoing uncertainty around Brexit and the resulting potential and actual damage to the UK economy.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote to the EU on Sunday morning, AEDT, requesting an extension to January 31 next year, as required by previously passed legislation. A meaningful vote on Mr Johnson's withdrawal agreement is still expected early this week.\n\nSaturday's outcome \"will temper some of the optimism from last week\" in markets, Mr Metcalfe said. However, the status quo \"shows how far sentiment has swung\".\n\n\"Compared to where we were two weeks ago, at least there is a deal agreed and if the Conservative Party does campaign in a possible election it will do so on the basis of its agreed withdrawal, rather than a 'no deal' Brexit.\"\n\nUltimately: \"there are two options: a Brexit deal or remain.\"\n\nIn an otherwise generally quiet week for market-moving data and events, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi leads his final monetary policy meeting on Thursday night. Mr Draghi resigns at the end of this month after eight years in office. He will will be replaced by former IMF chief Christine Lagarde.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Draghi is expected to hold the key deposit rate steady at -0.5 per cent after cutting it by 0.1 percentage points at the September meeting. At that meeting the ECB also said it planned to restart its bond-buying program, a controversial decision that sparked the resignation of a German board member.\n\nUnder Mr Draghi's presidency the ECB cut policy rates 10 times. Under his leadership, the Italian economist expanded the central bank's toolkit to include negative rates, massive bond-buying programs through quantitative easing, as well as forward guidance \u2013 all with the aim of easing financial conditions and stimulating economic demand.\n\nInstead, inflation has persistently undershot the target and growth in the eurozone broadly remains anemic. Early indicators of European manufacturing activity for October, to be released Thursday evening ahead of the meeting, are likely to confirm this trend.\n\n\"With a change in the presidency we expect continuity, with fiscal policy expected to do the heavy lifting by increasing potential growth and providing cyclical stabilisation,\" JPMorgan analysts wrote.", "description": "The weekend's delay of a key Brexit withdrawal agreement should result in some selling in the UK currency, but it should retain much of gains made in the past two weeks as a no deal exit still looks unlikely.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_106/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/502222f8ad7aac9388cf0601eec15a686549c87f", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
