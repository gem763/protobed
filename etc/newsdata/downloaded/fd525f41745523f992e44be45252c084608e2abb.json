Travel: \u201cWe experienced a breakdown in our internal communication when TripAdvisor identified an irregular pattern of reviews at our Wembley Central Travelodge Hotel.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately on this occasion that matter was not managed effectively within the timeframe, and we have taken appropriate action to ensure this does not happen again.\u201d\n\nThey added: \u201cWe are satisfied that the reviews accurately reflect the customer experience at the hotel.\u201d\n\nTripAdvisor said of the accusation that it is not doing enough to clamp down on false reviews: \u201cThe analysis presented by Which? is based on a flawed understanding of fake review patterns and is reliant on too many assumptions, and too little data.\n\n\u201cWe have an industry-leading team of fraud investigators who work tirelessly to protect the site from fake reviews. We are confident our approach works, and is one of the reasons we continue to retain the trust of many millions of consumers worldwide.\u201d\n\nIt follows a landmark legal ruling in Italy in 2018, which saw a fraudulent online reviewer sentenced to jail, in one of the first cases of its kind.\n\nThe owner of PromoSalento, a company that sells fake review packages to hospitality businesses in Italy, was sentenced to nine months in prison after the Criminal Court of Lecce ruled that writing fraudulent reviews under a false identity was \u201ccriminal conduct\u201d.\n\nThe defendant was also ordered to pay \u20ac8,000 in costs and damages.\n\nTripAdvisor supported the prosecution as a civil claimant, providing evidence from its in-house fraud investigations team.", "description": "Some high-ranking hotels on TripAdvisor have reached the top through fake reviews, a Which?
