In fact, Pewdiepie himself does not seem to know.\n\nNew York Times writer Kevin Roose spoke to Pewdiepie, nee Felix Kjellberg, in the aftermath of March\u2019s shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, where a shooter opened fired in a mosque after saying, \u201cRemember, lads, subscribe to PewDiePie.\u201d\n\nThe conversation came about, Roose wrote yesterday, when Kjellberg\u2019s publicist called him shortly after the shooting because Kjellberg wanted a chance to explain his views. Roose provided an example of what he calls one of their \u201cfutile exchanges.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there any politicians who excite you?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cLike, anywhere in the world?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t name one, no.\u201d \u201cWhat did you think about UKIP endorsing you?\u201d I asked. On Twitter, the far-right British party had recently told its followers to subscribe to his channel to stop T-Series from overtaking him. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of funny how a political party would post about a meme,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also kind of like, Ehh, don\u2019t drag me into your politics.\u201d\n\nThis exchange makes clear that, while Kjellberg has Mr. Magoo\u2019d himself into politically charged controversy after controversy, he does not seem to understand how to grapple with his level of fame and influence.\n\n\u201cMy job is just: I go to my office; I record a video in front of a camera,\u201d Kjellberg told Roose. \u201cIt\u2019s weird for me to be in this position [of influence], because I don\u2019t really want to be in this position.\u201d\n\nWhile this apathy toward politics might seem unlikely, I do find aspects of it relatable. I\u2019m often completely oblivious to the one sided relationship that people all over the world have with me over social media. I write a lot of my tweets on the toilet \u2014 it feels bizarre whenever one of those missives is given any kind of weight or importance.\n\nWhile Kjellberg might have started his YouTube channel with the intention of just saying stuff on the internet, he\u2019s no longer in the position where he can just let it sort itself out.\n\nThough much of the article is more a reflection on YouTube culture as a whole and a recap of Kjellberg\u2019s various controversies, near the end of the profile, Kjellberg speaks specifically about his ambivalent attitude towards his channel.\n\nRoose asked Kjellberg if he\u2019d ever delete his YouTube channel. \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me,\u201d Kjellberg answered. \u201cI kind of question if the positive outweighs the negative\u2026. It\u2019s a lot more than I think I signed up for.\u201d He clarified to Roose that he wouldn\u2019t do so. \u201cDeleting his channel is not something he would really go through with,\u201d Roose wrote. \u201cLike many other extreme ideas, it\u2019s just something he plays with from time to time.\u201d", "description": "A profile of YouTuber Pewdiepie in the New York Times titled \u201cWhat Does Pewdiepie Really Believe?\u201d does not quite answer that question.
