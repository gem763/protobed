For many kids, school lunch is one of the only consistent meals they get each day, but some schools have strict, and honestly inhumane policies about who is and isn\u2019t allowed to eat lunch. Case in point? News recently broke that one school in Ohio actually physically took food off of a 9-year-old child\u2019s tray \u2013 on his birthday! \u2013 over a $9 lunch debt. How could something like this happen?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full story is pretty enraging to read. The child and his siblings qualify for the free or reduced lunch program, but for some reason their paperwork had yet to be processed, even though the school year has already started.\n\nWhen the child went to pay for his lunch \u2013 a cheesy breadstick and dipping sauce \u2013 a cafeteria worker took the food off his tray, and replaced it with a cold lunch of bread and cheese. The food was taken off his tray in front of his peers, and the child was sent home with a note saying he owed $9 in lunch debt.\n\nTo make matters worse, it was the student\u2019s birthday, and he later declared it the worst one ever.\n\nThe school says that they have systems in place to make sure this sort of thing doesn\u2019t happen, but that\u2019s almost more alarming \u2013 if they have Family Support Specialists on staff that are supposed to reach out to families in need, and if they allegedly communicate multiple times to families with lunch debt, then how did this child fall through the cracks?\n\nHis grandmother, who the child and his two siblings recently moved in with, also pointed out that food that had been on a student\u2019s tray and was then confiscated was likely thrown away, because it would be unsanitary to put it back to be served to another child. That means that the food was wasted AND the kid was humiliated, which seems truly nonsensical.\n\nThe school also says that it offers an alternative lunch of a cheese sandwich or quesadilla, fruit, and vegetables to kids with more than $15 in debt, but the child in question only had $9 in debt. And regardless of a child\u2019s lunch debt (which is ultimately their adult caregivers\u2019 responsibility), is it really worth humiliating them in front of the other kids?\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like our country\u2019s school lunch debt problem isn\u2019t going away soon. We\u2019ve heard stories of families being threatened that their kids could be put in foster care over lunch debt, stories of kids being barred from graduation because of lunch debt and more.\n\nEven the \u201cheartwarming\u201d stories are depressing. Cafeteria workers being fired for lending money to students who couldn\u2019t afford lunch and kids using their allowance money to cover other students\u2019 lunch debt are admirable on the part of those trying their best to help, but they shouldn\u2019t have to. In one of the wealthiest countries in the world, kids shouldn\u2019t have to go hungry at school or worry about racking up debt when they\u2019re trying to learn.\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
