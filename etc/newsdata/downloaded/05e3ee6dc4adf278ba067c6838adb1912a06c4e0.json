For proof, consider how two of America\u2019s premier institutions are being dragged through the mud because their leaders decided that standards are for other people.\n\nI speak of the FBI and The New York Times, and the men who damaged them, James Comey and Dean Baquet. It is no coincidence that Baquet\u2019s newspaper became an errand boy for Comey\u2019s corrupt team of G-men. Birds of a feather, you know.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThey were united against Donald Trump. Both tried to block him from becoming president, and both tried to get him removed. And are still trying.\n\nComey and Baquet decided their agendas were more important than the time-tested rules of behavior that built the credibility of their respective institutions. Like arrogant leaders everywhere, they believed the end justified the means.\n\nThe standards that Comey trashed are the ones the inspector general of the Justice Department, Michael Horowitz, cited in referring Comey for criminal prosecution. By writing memos about his meetings with Trump and leaking them to the Times, Comey created a \u201cdangerous example\u201d for other agents, Horowitz said.\n\nHis concern, he told Congress, was that Comey, even as FBI director, had no right to decide he was \u201cnot going to follow established norms and procedures.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRecall that Horowitz also criticized Comey last year for \u201cusurping the authority of the attorney general\u201d when he announced that Hillary Clinton would not face charges over her handling of classified materials.\n\nThose incidents have done incalculable harm to the nation\u2019s top law-enforcement agency and prove that Comey\u2019s self-created image of a choir boy was a sham. He was as dirty as J. Edgar Hoover but not half as smart.\n\nAnd the full damage is not yet known.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CONTINUE READING MICHAEL GOODWIN'S COLUMN IN THE NEW YORK POST\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MICHAEL GOODWIN", "description": "Two of America\u2019s premier institutions are being dragged through the mud because their leaders decided that standards are for other people.", "authors": ["Michael Goodwin"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Comey090419.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
