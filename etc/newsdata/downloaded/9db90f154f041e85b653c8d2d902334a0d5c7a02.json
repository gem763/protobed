Stewart said that he worries about the cost of living and feels that Liberal policies are making it difficult for middle-class Canadians to make ends meet.\n\nStewart asked Scheer if he would commit to legislative changes that would crack down on foreign ownership of Canadian real estate so that people like him can afford to buy a house.\n\nWatch: Scheer answers questions from small business owner Bryan Stewart:\n\nBryan Stewart from Surrey, B.C. told Scheer he feels it\u2019s hard for middle-class Canadians to make ends meet, and feels it\u2019s impossible for his family to own a home. 2:36\n\nComing up this week on The National Presents: Face to Face with the Federal Party Leaders:\n\nWednesday, Oct. 2: Green Leader Elizabeth May.\n\nThursday, Oct. 3: NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.\n\nThree other undecided voters got a chance to question Scheer today:\n\nUmair Ali, 30, of Brampton, Ont., who said he aligns with the Conservatives' social and fiscal policies but is worried about inclusion.\n\nMarkus Harvey, 50, who said his family has lived for the past 100 years in Maugerville, N.B., a town that experienced extreme flooding in 2018 and 2019.\n\nMaggie Cywink, 57, of White Fish River First Nation on Manitoulin Island, who is a special adviser to the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls inquiry.\n\nMethodology:\n\nThe undecided voters chosen to question the leaders have been carefully selected from across the country and represent the diversity of the electorate groups \u2014 regionally, racially and ethnically, socio-economic, different ages, different priorities. Each voter is undecided, but open to voting for the leader they are across from and looking for the answers they need for a question that relates to their lives.\n\nWe invited leaders who are running national campaigns. We provided a date range in order to have them all recorded and aired in the span of one week. Maxime Bernier and the PPC declined, citing scheduling issues. Yves-Francois Blanchet was not invited as the Bloc Quebecois is only running candidates in one province.", "description": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer sat down today with five undecided voters from across the country to answer questions about how he would tackle the issues that matter most to them.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5305162.1569968785!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/the-national-presents-face-to-face-with-the-federal-party-leaders.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
