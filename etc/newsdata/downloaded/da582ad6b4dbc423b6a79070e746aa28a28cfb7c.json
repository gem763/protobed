This woman was in severe distress and we were lucky to find her in time. While I am glad we could rescue her, I urge people not to take this risk of crossing the border illegally is too dangerous and never worth risking a life.\u201d\n\nFollowing her release from the hospital, Border Patrol agents will transport her to the station for processing under CBP guidelines.\n\nDuring Fiscal Year 2019, AMO aircrews carried out 136 rescue operation missions, according to information provided to Breitbart Texas by CBP officials.
