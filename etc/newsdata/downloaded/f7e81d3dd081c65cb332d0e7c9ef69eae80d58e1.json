He'd been in power for nearly thirty years and, like Al Sisi, was a member of the military.", "description": "If he wins President Al Sisi could stay in power until 2030 and the role of the already powerful military would be boosted too.", "authors": ["Daniel Bellamy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/81/39/56/1000x563_cmsv2_1cb7700f-aef7-52cb-b8b6-b3caf5af46e8-3813956.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-20"}
