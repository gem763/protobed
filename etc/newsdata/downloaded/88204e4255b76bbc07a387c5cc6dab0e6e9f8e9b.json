ETH price is showing positive signs and it might continue to rise above the $225 level.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nYesterday, ETH price corrected lower below the $212 and $210 supports against the US Dollar. Moreover, there was a break below the $205 support area. However, the $202 and $200 levels acted as strong supports. A swing low was formed near $202 and the price started a fresh increase. It surged above the $210 and $215 resistance levels to move back into a positive zone.\n\nMore importantly, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $208 on the hourly chart of the ETH/USD pair. It opened the doors for more gains above the $220 level. Finally, the price traded to a new monthly high at $225. Recently, Ethereum started a downside correction and traded below the $220 level. It even broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $202 low to $225 high.\n\nHowever, there are many supports on the downside near the $215 and $212 levels. Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $202 low to $225 high is also near the $213 level. There is also a new major bullish trend line forming with support near $210 on the same chart. More importantly, the 100 hourly simple moving average is also close to the trend line and $208.\n\nTherefore, dips towards the $212 and $210 levels could find a strong buying interest in the near term. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $225 level. If there is an upside break above $225, the price could rally further towards the $240 resistance area.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is back in a positive zone above the $210 and $212 levels. As long as there is no close below the $210 support and the 100 hourly SMA, there are chances of another increase towards the $240 level.\n\nETH Technical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is about to move into the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is currently correcting lower towards the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $210\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $225", "description": "Ethereum price is back in a positive zone versus the US Dollar and bitcoin.
