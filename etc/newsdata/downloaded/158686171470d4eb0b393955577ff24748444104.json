Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has a plan: She intends to expose Republicans in Congress, bringing to light what has \u2014 it would appear \u2014 been so far kept in darkness. AOC wants to finally prove that the GOP endorses Donald Trump.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s how it sounds.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, the 29-year-old insisted the President must be impeached even if his ousting fails; she wants every Republican to be shown as a worshipper of the devil. I mean, supporter of the President.\n\nDoes she mean exactly the way Democrats supported Clinton when he was impeached? Like that way?\n\nJudge for yourself.\n\nHere\u2019s what she had to say:\n\n\u201c[I] think that once the House impeaches, the House has impeached the President.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s let that one stew for a moment\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve just put on my white coat\u2026I\u2019ve entered the laboratory\u2026\n\nAnd I\u2019m testing the veracity of that statement right at this very moment\u2026\n\nYeah \u2014 yeah, I guess she\u2019s right.\n\nContinuing:\n\n\u201c[T]hen that hearing goes to the Senate. If they want to fail it, then I want to see every Republican go on the record and knowingly vote against impeachment of this president \u2014 knowing his corruption, having it on the record, so that they can have that stay on their careers for the rest of their lives. Because this it outrageous, to protect the amount of lawlessness\u2026\u201d\n\nShe wants it all on the record.\n\nTake with me, if you will, a stroll down memory lane. Let\u2019s skip along to, maybe a little over five months ago\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s a tweet from the same person as above:\n\nThe GOP\u2019s whole game of wasting votes in Congress to target others \u201con the record\u201d, for leg they have no intent to pass, is a disgrace. Stop wasting the American peoples\u2019 time + learn to govern. Our jobs aren\u2019t for campaigning, & that\u2019s exactly what these bluff-votes are for. https://t.co/ELzpQhlezo \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 23, 2019\n\nAnd that, my friends, is called \u201cpolitics.\u201d\n\nLike\u2026maybe the same system in which, given that we have a two-party setup, one party will defend their highest ranking member if he/she is attacked \u2014 or impeached \u2014 by the other party.\n\nAOC\u2019s Twittering, by the way, was in response to Mitch McConnell\u2019s move to put up the cowfart fighter\u2019s Green New Deal for a vote in the Senate (catch the hilarity here).\n\nAs for Donald Trump\u2019s \u201clawlessness,\u201d this seems to be brought up quite a bit. Curiously, it doesn\u2019t appear to frequently be combined with evidence of such.\n\nBut it\u2019s all terribly true. Just ask Rob Reiner (here):\n\nThe Impeachment process is about to begin. The articles drawn up will be voluminous. Never in our nation\u2019s history has there been a more lawless President. He has continually lied to the American people & has used the Presidency to line his pockets. GOP, history is watching. \u2014 Rob Reiner (@robreiner) September 7, 2019\n\nBut honestly, what I think is much worse is DT\u2019s abject racism and the reality that, although the executive branch is limited in power, and we live in a democratic republic, and there are checks and balances, and Congress passes our laws, and any given presidency can only last two terms at most\u2026despite all that, Donald John Trump, through sheer tyranny of will, is about to destroy all of humanity. Maybe that\u2019s why all the Republicans are hiding their very secretive support of him.\n\nThis is, in fact, unarguable:\n\nIt is unarguable, Donald Trump is a racist. If you support him you are supporting racism. At this crucial time in the struggle for the soul of our nation, we all must choose. Either embrace his hatred or fight to overcome original sin. Humanity hangs in the balance. \u2014 Rob Reiner (@robreiner) July 15, 2019\n\n-ALEX\n\nRelevant RedState links in this article: here and here.\n\nSee 3 more pieces from me:\n\nNewt Gingrich Obliterates Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: She\u2019s \u2018Vicious, Cruel & Dishonest\u2019 And Despises America\n\nDumbest Yet?
