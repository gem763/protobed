REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas\n\nPolitical leaders and analysts said the broad trends from Maharashtra, home to financial capital Mumbai, and the northern state of Haryana showed that while Modi remained the most popular leader, there were pockets of resistance emerging to his dominance.\n\nThe state elections were the first since he swept to power in the national polls over the summer riding a wave of nationalism focused against arch rival Pakistan and their central dispute over Kashmir.\n\nModi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a regional ally sewed up a comfortable win in Maharashtra, cornering 160 of the state assembly\u2019s 288 seats, according to the Election Commission of India. That\u2019s more than the simple majority required to rule one of India\u2019s richest states.\n\nIn Haryana, the BJP had either won or was ahead in 38 seats, with the main opposition Congress party close behind at 31 seats. The state has a 90-member assembly, meaning either party will need an ally to form a government.\n\nJannayak Janta Party, a regional party that has emerged king-maker in the state, has not announced who it will side with.\n\n\u201cThe keys to the Haryana assembly will be with the Jannayak Janta Party,\u201d party leader Dushyant Chautala told reporters on Thursday.\n\nBut BJP chief Amit Shah indicated he was confident of coming to power in Haryana, congratulating cadre and voters in a tweet.\n\n\u201cI congratulate the public for making BJP the largest party and giving it a chance to serve again,\u201d said Shah, who is also India\u2019s home minister.\n\nStill, the results fell below expectations after pollsters had predicted Modi would romp to victory, as did the BJP, which was confident of a better showing, particularly in Haryana.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed with our performance in Haryana. We were expecting a clear majority,\u201d a party official said, declining to be named.\n\nAnd in Maharashtra, BJP\u2019s weaker performance compared with the last poll has led to demands from its ally Shiv Sena that the regional party have a greater say in the formation of the state\u2019s new administration.\n\nSanjay Jha, spokesman of the main opposition Congress, said that voters were unhappy with the BJP\u2019s inability to resuscitate a stagnant economy, address record joblessness and cut corruption, and were not swayed by the ruling party\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cPeople are seeing through it,\u201d he said. \u201cBasically, hyper-nationalism, which is based on a very false foundation, has a limited shelf-life and I think they can\u2019t repeat that story again and again.\u201d\n\nRISING UNEMPLOYMENT\n\nBJP leaders campaigned on Modi\u2019s decision to strike down Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s autonomy in August in order to integrate it fully into India as a sign of his toughness and willingness to take on Pakistan, which disputes the territory.\n\nVoters applauded a tough national security position, but they also were concerned about rising unemployment, rural distress and poor roads, said Mumbai-based political analyst Pratap Asbe.\n\nMaharashtra and Haryana are both home to manufacturing units of major automobile companies, including Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra, that have hit a rough patch because of falling sales.\n\nIndia\u2019s passenger vehicle sales slumped 23.7% in September, the eleventh straight month of declines, prompting an industry body to flag more job cuts on top of some 350,000 workers the sector has already laid off this year if sales did not to pick up soon.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nOverall, India\u2019s economy grew between April and June at its weakest pace since 2013, as consumer demand and government spending slowed amid global trade frictions.\n\nGilles Verniers, assistant professor of political science at Ashoka University, said that early trends showed that the BJP\u2019s strategy of taking the focus away from the economy by talking about national security was not going to work indefinitely.\n\n\u201cSooner or later, they (BJP) will have to face the reality that the economy is going down and the hardship it produces is going to produce adverse results for them in elections,\u201d Verniers said.", "description": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party retained its control over a big western state on Tuesday and was left scouting for an ally to keep hold of a northern state, after the two election races turned out to be closer than forecast.", "authors": ["Rajendra Jadhav", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444430657&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0LL", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
