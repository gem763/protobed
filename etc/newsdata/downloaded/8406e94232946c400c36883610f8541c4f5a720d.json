DOCS ON UKRAINE, GIULIANI IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\nHe spoke after the State Department missed a Friday deadline to comply with a subpoena issued by House Democrats to hand over documents related to the department\u2019s dealings with Ukraine and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. He told reporters that the department had sent a letter to Congress, \"which is our initial response to the document request.\" He also said that the department would do what it is required to do by law.\n\nUnder particular scrutiny is Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump urged Zelensky to look into possible interference by Ukraine in the 2016 election as well as former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s and his son Hunter\u2019s conduct in the country. During the call, Trump asked for a \u201cfavor\u201d in the form of Ukraine providing information about theories related to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee server in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe server, they say Ukraine has it,\u201d he told Zelensky.\n\nDemocrats claim that Trump used $400 million in military aid as a quid pro quo for the Ukrainians to investigate a political opponent and have opened an impeachment inquiry, firing off a raft of subpoenas within a few days to top administration and White House officials. The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the White House late Friday, with the Democratic chairmen of three committees saying that Trump has \u201cchosen the path of defiance, obstruction and cover up\u201d in response to the inquiry.\n\nOn Saturday, Pompeo did not specifically address the Biden question but defended the administration\u2019s interest in any possible Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election as one that was part of the government's duty to make sure America\u2019s elections are secure. He also said that administration was \"full-fledged\" on its commitment to pushing back against corruption in Ukraine.\n\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE SUBPOENAS WHITE HOUSE IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\n\"I think everyone recognizes that governments have an obligation indeed a duty to ensure that elections happen with integrity without interference from any government whether that's the Ukrainian government or any other,\" Pompeo said Saturday. \"So inquiries with respect to that are completely important and if we need another government's assistance it's very reasonable to ask that government to say 'Do you have any help that you can provide?' So we can protect the American people so that they can vote in free and fair elections without interference from any other country.\"\n\nHe also suggested the Obama administration was negligent in those duties.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cI only wish that the previous administration had protected our elections back in 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cYou recall that the interference that took place took place under the previous administration.\"\n\nPompeo\u2019s remarks come as the administration has sought to go on the offense in the face of the Democratic impeachment push. The White House was expected to send a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as early as Monday arguing that Congress could not mount its impeachment inquiry without first having a vote to authorize it. Trump on Friday said that he has an \u201cobligation\u201d to end corruption, even if that requires enlisting other countries.\n\n\u201cThis has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThis does have to do with their corruption!\u201d", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday defended the Trump administration over its dealings with Ukraine amid an escalating impeachment inquiry into the matter from House Democrats -- telling reporters that governments have a \u201cduty\u201d to investigate possible interference in the 2016 election, and accusing the Obama administration of not doing enough.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/02/694940094001_6091289148001_6091286260001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
