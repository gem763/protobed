But the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist \u201cbecame very attached to quiet, rural surroundings,\u201d and found that the solitude helped him write, according to Blake Bailey, who is working on an authorized biography of the writer.\n\nMr. Roth died last year at age 85, and the Connecticut property where he lived for decades and wrote a number of his books is listing for $2.925 million. The divorced writer had no children; the property is being sold by his estate, according to listing agent Peter Klemm of Klemm Real Estate.\n\nLocated in the town of Warren in Litchfield County, about a two-hour drive from New York City, the property is composed of pastures and woods crisscrossed with stone walls, said Mr. Klemm. Flanked by maple trees, the three-bedroom, clapboard house was built around 1790, and has many of its original details. The grounds also include a barn, an in-ground swimming pool and a two-room writing studio where Mr. Roth worked.\n\nA Writer\u2019s Retreat in Connecticut The roughly 150-acre estate of novelist Philip Roth is hitting the market for $2.925 million.

MICHAEL BOWMAN PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nAt times when he was writing, Mr. Roth \u201cessentially lived in\u201d the studio, Mr. Bailey said, sleeping there at night and returning to the main house only for meals.\n\nMr. Roth lived primarily at the Connecticut home from about 1996 to 2001, a \u201cgolden age in his writing\u201d during which he produced three books known as the American Trilogy: the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cAmerican Pastoral,\u201d \u201cThe Human Stain\u201d and \u201cI Married a Communist,\u201d said Mr. Bailey. Later, Mr. Roth split his time between Connecticut and New York City, Mr. Bailey said.\n\nPhilip Roth at his home in Warren, Conn.

The novel \u201cThe Human Stain\u201d is set in a small New England town. \u201cThe Ghost Writer\u201d describes \u201ca clapboard farmhouse at the end of an unpaved road 12 hundred feet up in the Berkshires.\u201d\n\nTo store his book collection, Mr. Roth turned one of the rooms in the house into a library, with metal shelving in the middle. The books remain in the house for now, but will eventually go to the Newark Public Library along with some personal effects. Most of the furniture has been removed, Mr. Klemm said. A number of Mr. Roth\u2019s personal items, including typewriters, were sold at auction in July.\n\nMr. Roth was one of many prominent people attracted to scenic Litchfield County to \u201chide in the hills,\u201d said Mr. Klemm, who handled the sale of the late playwright Arthur Miller \u2019s home in nearby Roxbury last year. Mr. Roth and Mr. Miller knew each other and sometimes socialized, Mr. Bailey said. Other well-known residents of the area include Graydon Carter , Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, according to people familiar with the area and public records. Mr. Roth bought the house in 1972 for $110,000 in cash, Mr. Bailey said, and added adjoining properties over the years. \u201cHe bought everything around him for privacy,\u201d Mr. Klemm said.\n\nMr. Roth did something similar in New York, buying the apartments next to and below his Upper West Side condo, then renting them out to tenants he knew would be relatively quiet and wouldn\u2019t disturb his writing, Mr. Bailey said. The estate listed Mr. Roth\u2019s apartment earlier this year for $3.2 million, along with the adjacent studio for $680,000. The properties recently sold for a total of roughly $3.6 million to a family that plans to combine the two apartments, said listing agent Lisa Lippman of Brown Harris Stevens. The unit Mr. Roth owned below his apartment sold in June for $1.55 million to the tenants who had rented it from the writer, Ms. Lippman said.\n\nWrite to Candace Taylor at Candace.Taylor@wsj.com", "description": "The time Roth spent living on the 150-acre property in Litchfield County was considered \u2018a golden age in his writing,\u2019 according to an authorized biographer of the writer.", "authors": ["Candace Taylor", "Candace.Taylor Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104453/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
