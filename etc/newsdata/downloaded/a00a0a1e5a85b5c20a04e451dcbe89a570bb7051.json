The Brazilian government wants to save up to 9 billion reais ($2.1 billion) in 2019, with initiatives specifically related to reducing benefit fraud.\n\nmust read Windows 10 privacy guide: How to take control In this guide, Ed Bott shows you which privacy settings help you create the right balance of privacy and convenience in Windows 10.

It added that the data belonging to over 34 million Brazilians, often vulnerable citizens, has been often used for fraud purposes and for credit agencies to offer their products illegally.\n\nAccording to the watchdog, such leaks have been going on for years and despite investigations, no conclusions have been reached.\n\n\"It is unreasonable to implement technology that uses sensitive data without citizens being assured that such data will be treated securely and will not be leaked to companies that have abusive or even illegal practices,\" says Diogo Moyses, coordinator of Idec's Telecommunications and Digital Rights program.\n\nAccording to Dataprev, the security and governance aspects of the project have been covered during the projects' inception and development within its innovation lab.\n\nThe state-controlled company has recently released a manifesto protesting against its impending privatization, due to the criticality of the sensitive data that it holds.\n\n\"Regarding privatization, Dataprev is awaiting studies that should advance these discussions, but it stresses that its data protection policy will always improve, advance and follow the law, regardless of the company's legal nature,\" the state-owned firm said in a statement.", "description": "Watchdog urges the government to put plans to procure the technology should be put on hold until security issues around citizen data are solved.", "authors": ["Angelica Mari"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/03/06e37510-91b1-4583-8d32-907e05c3c02d/thumbnail/770x578/106526c3c91f89a1f9703026bad8b9fa/istock000037308888small.jpg"}
