Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nA dispute between Muji and Singapore retailer IUIGA has been settled, almost eight months after the Japanese lifestyle and household goods giant filed a lawsuit alleging trademark infringement and passing-off.\n\nIn March, Business Insider first reported that Muji, through its parent company Ryohin Keikaku, had commenced its claim against IUIGA Technologies in the Singapore High Court on January 25.\n\nAt the time, Muji told Business Insider that it was seeking for orders to stop the use of the Muji trademark in Iuiga\u2019s statements, as well as compensation for damages and losses.\n\nRead also: Japan\u2019s Muji sues Singapore retailer Iuiga for alleged trademark infringement\n\nIUIGA had, according to the Japanese company, used phrases such as \u201cMuji same manufacturer\u201d and \u201cdirect from Muji manufacturer\u201d on its e-commerce website and in its physical store.\n\n\u201cWe requested Iuiga to disclose information on their manufacturing factories to verify their statements.
