(Nick Wass/AP)\n\nIsaiah Thomas laughed at the doctor.\n\nHis latest injury, a torn ligament in his left thumb, had rewritten Murphy\u2019s Law. On Sept 16., Thomas was playing in the first pickup game of the day with his new Washington Wizards teammates when he attempted to secure the ball and jammed his thumb.\n\nThough he played on, the swollen finger would later turn purple. After Thomas received the results of an MRI exam \u2014 which revealed he would require surgery to repair a ruptured radial collateral ligament \u2014 all he could do was chuckle.\n\n\u201cI was in there laughing because I\u2019m like: \u2018Damn. It\u2019s always something,\u2019\u201d Thomas recalled Monday. \u201cBut at the end of the day, this won\u2019t break me. I\u2019ve been through way worse.\u201d\n\nThomas is no longer wearing a cast, but he will miss all of training camp, the preseason and at least the first three games of the regular season. Thomas has dealt with hip problems since 2017, forcing him to miss games and endure the monotony of rehabilitation. So, unlike most nine-year NBA veterans, Thomas had actually been looking forward to participating in training camp.\n\nThough he laughed away the pain when given the bad news, Thomas has maintained perspective about this latest fluke injury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m past that. I\u2019ve been through real-life situations,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI mean, I really couldn\u2019t control that. I went for the ball and I jammed my thumb, and then, I mean, you know, it went to a torn ligament. Everything happens for a reason.\u201d\n\nThe injury happened weeks after Thomas earned an invitation to the hush-hush camp held by one of his mentors, Kobe Bryant.\n\nDetails have recently trickled out about Bryant\u2019s private minicamp, for which he handpicked several superstars such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George of the Los Angeles Clippers and up-and-coming players such as the Denver Nuggets\u2019 Jamal Murray and New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 Josh Hart. Thomas was also one of the chosen few, working out his mind and body for six hours a day for two consecutive days.\n\nThomas said Bryant answered players\u2019 questions, shared feedback about their individual games and broke down game footage. He said all other details about Kobe\u2019s camp shall remain confidential.\n\n\u201cSuch great players being in that setting and being able to compete and be able to learn from Kobe Bryant is like one of the best two days in my life,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBasketball-wise we watched film with him, we did mind things with him. We did a lot. I don\u2019t want to say all the things because he might get mad. He was trying to keep that where nobody knows really what went down. But it was a great two days where you learned a lot from the best player to play the game.\u201d\n\nBut \u2026 mind things?\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not going to get in detail,\u201d Thomas said through his dimpled smile. \u201cHe does weird things. But I mean, if he does it, it works. But it was great. It was a great two days.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nBradley Beal, entering the season without John Wall, dismisses the doubters\n\nThree questions entering Wizards training camp\n\nNew GM Tommy Sheppard seeks players who will follow \u2018The Wizards Way\u2019\n\nThe Wizards could learn a thing or two from the Mystics, the best team in the WNBA", "description": "Wizards guard is staying positive, even though he will not be able to participate in training camp.", "authors": ["Candace Buckner", "National Basketball Association With An Emphasis In Covering The Washington Wizards.", "October At Am", "Candace Buckner Covers The Washington Wizards.
