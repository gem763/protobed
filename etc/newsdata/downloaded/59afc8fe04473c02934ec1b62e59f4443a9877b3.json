But analysts say the other superpowers are perceived in Africa as more invested \u2014 Chinese and Russian leaders visibly spend more time with their African counterparts.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe U.S. isn\u2019t paying attention, and Russia is rushing in to fill the void,\u201d said Paul Stronski, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\u2019s Russia and Eurasia Program.\n\nAD\n\nThe Unites States is the globe\u2019s top foreign-aid donor \u2014 about a third of those funds go to Africa \u2014 and runs dozens of military bases that supply manpower, training and intelligence on the continent. U.S. trade with Africa, at $39 billion, still eclipses Russia\u2019s.\n\nMoscow, which has a smaller pocketbook, is seeking to gain the upper hand with a flood of soft power, Stronski said.\n\n\n\nPutin made the 14-hour flight to South Africa last year, for instance. President Trump has yet to visit the continent. (His wife, first lady Melania Trump, and daughter Ivanka Trump made trips last year.)\n\nRussia welcomed 43 heads of state or government, along with dozens of business and community leaders, this week in Sochi. Trump has hosted a much smaller set of African leaders, including official visits from Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta.\n\nIn a Thursday speech in the resort city, Putin asserted that his country has \u201csupported the struggle of the peoples of Africa against colonialism, racism and apartheid.\u201d (Trump sparked outrage on the continent last year after referring to some African nations by a derogatory phrase in a White House meeting.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s biggest event on the continent to date, meanwhile, irked some African observers, who criticized the United States for sending no Cabinet heads to an event attended by 11 African presidents.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was supposed to promote Prosper Africa, a program meant to increase business partnerships, at June\u2019s U.S.-Africa Business Summit in the southern nation of Mozambique but canceled because of a scheduling conflict.\n\nThe program, widely seen as the White House\u2019s Africa strategy, was designed to provide technical help to companies trying to enter or expand in Africa, which is urbanizing more quickly than anywhere else.\n\nThe Sochi summit spawned $12.5 billion in business deals, largely in arms and grains, the Kremlin said. But most of those contracts made no guarantee of investment, the Financial Times reported.\n\nRussia is highlighting collaboration over aid, and that message is tempting to some leaders who view the West\u2019s outreach as patronizing, said Bakary Sambe, director of the Timbuktu Institute African Center for Peace Studies in Dakar.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAfrica no longer wants to have all our eggs in one basket,\u201d Sambe said. \u201cWe want equal exchanges, as opposed to colonial power relations.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Russia announced plans to send more weapons and instructors to the Central African Republic to aid the government\u2019s battle against rebel groups \u2014 a move that bolsters its biggest military footprint on the continent.\n\nPutin wants to forge strategic alliances with like-minded rulers, said Joshua Meservey, an Africa analyst at the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cAfrican countries are the largest voting bloc in the U.N.,\u201d he said, \u201c and they frequently vote together.\u201d\n\nBorso Tall contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Moscow is offering power plants, attack helicopters and mercenaries.", "authors": ["Danielle Paquette", "West Africa Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ssXIghApDzvRUM7DAiE7cF4exUI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZTRPY6HXF4I6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
