She was the daughter of a GP father and a mother who was a nurse, gift-shop owner and raised several children.\n\nHutson attended the University of Queensland, studying commerce and law while lodging at Emmanuel College, initially in its smallest room in 1986. She rowed for the First IV and won the first regatta they competed in, she told graduates decades later.\n\n\u201cShe was aggressive, as was I. She was a stickler for observing the law,\u201d S8 boss Chris Stott said. AAP\n\nAfter university, she worked at McCullough Robertson on mergers including between Bendigo Bank and credit unions. \u201cJenny \u2026 is an exceptional lawyer. Impeccable relationship with clients,\u201d said Matthew Reynolds, who worked with her at McCullough Robertson and G8. \u201cI never saw anything that was inappropriate,\u201d he told court.\n\nLegal success mixed with love at McCullough Robertson; she and the firm\u2019s Brett Heading had two sons together. They have since separated.\n\nA long-term business partnership ignited in 2001, when she helped list S8 for its managing director, Chris Scott. Scott appeared in Hutson's hearing wearing a businessman\u2019s jacket, but speaking with the blunt mouth of the former trucker that he is.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like lawyers too much. They seem to get in the way of things all the time. Screw up deals. Charge too much,\u201d he said. But Hutson was someone he could work with. \u201cShe was aggressive, as was I. She was a stickler for observing the law,\u201d he said.\n\nScott, who has not been charged, said he encouraged Hutson to establish her own investment bank Wellington Capital in 2005, telling her: \u201cYou\u2019re \u2026 never going to get rich unless you do your own thing\u201d.\n\nOver the next three years Wellington accumulated $1 billion in assets under management, according to sharemarket filings. The profile of Hutson, inevitably wearing her trademark red leather jacket, flourished. She made the 2010 edition of Who\u2019s Who Business Australia, listing her interests as travel and wine.\n\nWellington was a workplace with benefits. Hutson took staff overseas for thank-yous and celebrations. But things might also have been paranoid, with one witness telling court she believed Wellington's phones had been swept for listening bugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were bumps too, such as when complaints flowed from disgruntled investors during Wellington\u2019s running of a fund once part of the collapsed investment outfit MFS, of which Scott had been a director in its dying days.\n\nHutson's and Scott\u2019s last project together was on childcare, forming a new operation after Eddy Groves\u2019s ABC Learning imploded in 2008. Their operation became G8.\n\n\u201cWith ABC collapsing ... nobody thought [mass childcare] could work,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt was a wide open space. And my view was, and Jenny agreed with me, is we would not have this to ourselves forever.\u201d\n\nTheir accelerated path forward was acquisitions and acquisitions. And that lead to ASIC\u2019s investigation.\n\nThe takeover\n\nIt\u2019s 2015, and G8 has 460 centres, trading under brands such as Kinder Haven. Rival outfit Affinity Education, with 160 centres, looks vulnerable in G8\u2019s eyes.\n\nG8 in July snags 19.8 per cent of Affinity shares and launches a takeover. Soon after, Nigel Elias, a portly man with an English accent, starts acquiring Affinity shares.\n\nNigel Elias was a buyer of Affinity shares.\n\nIt began with Hutson phoning while Elias waited at Gold Coast airport\u2019s baggage area, according to his evidence.\n\nHutson allegedly asked if he was interested in acquiring some shares \u2013 the target company was not even named initially \u2013 and Elias claimed he had replied he would need money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors alleged that Hutson arranged finance \u2013 from G8. The court heard it was not their only dealing together; Wellington had also lent funds to entities associated with Print Mail Logistics, where Elias was managing director, and Hutson\u2019s defence repeatedly questioned whether their discussions would touch on these loans.\n\nInside Wellington, according to evidence from prosecution witness Mary-Anne Greaves \u2013 the bank's former general counsel, Hutson fretted about any public knowledge of Elias and childcare shares.\n\nElias had allegedly asked Greaves about a fee in an email, which was supposedly printed out and taken to Hutson. Hutson allegedly replied to \u201ctell Nigel that he will be paid \u2013 but to never put anything like that in an email again\u201d, Greaves retold in an ASIC statement, the court heard.\n\nThe bank's former general counsel Mary-Anne Greaves said Hutson fretted about any public knowledge of Elias and childcare shares.\n\nBut Greaves\u2019s evidence was relentlessly picked at, because she had on numerous occasions not provided the same detailed anecdotes when ASIC initially interrogated her in 2016. That included missing the email anecdote.\n\nGreaves told court she had in that first interrogation been suffering personal issues and was on medication for shoulder injuries. \u201cAt the time I couldn\u2019t remember a lot of stuff,\u201d she maintained. She had pleaded guilty to providing false information to ASIC, the court heard, but Greaves argued that marked one instance of her being mistaken.\n\nG8\u2019s bid to acquire Affinity proved unsuccessful. Still, the Takeovers Panel released findings in October 2015 about share purchases by people that Hutson knew. It triggered a referral that two ASIC officers, Mathew Bastianon and Peter Paleologos, from its corporate governance team in Melbourne, dug into.\n\nThe cover story\n\nJupiters (Star) Casino dominates a small island on Gold Coast canal waters. It\u2019s in a white-painted, wide-bodied tower built in the 1980s. In October 2015, the court heard, Hutson, Elias and another businessman called David Burke met there and discussed a cover story.\n\nThe necessity was because Hutson had set up a \u201cdishonest\u201d scheme so G8 could be seen to have lent money to Burke\u2019s company, prosecutors claimed. His company then supposedly on-lent the funds so Elias, who has not been charged, could acquire childcare shares.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe cover story \u2026 proposed to Mr Elias was that Mr Burke and Mr Elias had known each other for decades, and it was just a happy coincidence that Mr Burke had money and Mr Elias said \u2018I\u2019m happy to invest it\u2019,\u201d prosecutor Glen Rice, QC, told the court.\n\nThe problem, Rice claimed, was the men had never met before. It was one of several secretive meetings alleged by Rice, a specialist in prosecuting serious and organised crime who has practised since 1979.\n\nThose meetings included one in February 2016 at the Intercontinental Hotel, a 19th century heritage building in Sydney. Hutson allegedly handed fake loan documents to Elias there.\n\nAt another dinner that month, a day before ASIC interrogated Elias, the businessman alleged Hutson had asked him to provide an \u201caccount of events\u201d to investigators. An ASIC officer\u2019s note was read in court, detailing an alleged conversation with Elias a month after that dinner: \u201c6pm, night before examination, wants me to lie to ASIC.\u201d\n\nBut the defence repeatedly, severely questioned Elias\u2019s evidence. That included Elias maintaining he had been honest during his ASIC examination, yet he could not explain why he had not told investigators initially about Hutson\u2019s alleged interrogation fix.\n\n\u201cI can't remember,\u201d Elias told court.\n\nBy April 2016, according to ASIC\u2019s case, Hutson and Elias met at Brisbane\u2019s Stamford Plaza, a riverside hotel that accommodated Chinese President Xi Jinping. Hutson allegedly wanted Elias\u2019s help with another cover story to account for her allegedly having used G8 money to purchase ANZ shares.\n\nHutson knew \u201cshe\u2019d be in big trouble if there was no explanation\u201d, prosecutor Rice said. The meeting allegedly involved her presenting fake instructions detailing how Hutson's private company had bought ANZ shares for Elias and held them on trust.\n\nJenny Hutson seen leaving court last month. AAP\n\nDuring the hearings, Hutson listened and jotted notes on a long legal pad. She no longer wore the red jacket. Instead it was more demure outfits, such as a blue suit and skirt. But she was armoured with formidable legal talents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat includes solicitor Glen Cranny, a white-collar crime specialist and winner of the Queensland Law Society President\u2019s Medal. He sat everyday, note-taking and reading files. There\u2019s also Neil Clelland, QC, who represented former prime minister Julia Gillard at the union royal commission. At times, he dissected witness testimony by enunciating, each, word, slowly.\n\nThey probed the appropriateness of ASIC\u2019s use of powerful Section 19 examinations, where a person must respond to questions but the answers cannot be used in a prosecution (unless they lie). Almost a dozen were conducted. It was an issue because Hutson had refused an official interview, where people can remain silent, only for ASIC the next day to issue her a Section 19 notice.\n\nBastianon denied ASIC had tried using the interrogation to cover off any defences in a prosecution case. He argued ASIC would want to know any innocent explanations for transactions.\n\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t do that, you would be standing here asking me, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you ask my client \u2026 to give her version?\u2019 \u201d Bastianon maintained. He said one option around the time had been \u201cno further action\u201d, meaning no charges would be filed.\n\nCharges were ultimately laid, and case documents were contained in white folders marked with Hutson\u2019s name and G8 Education at the seventh-floor court. It seemed a plain thing for such explosive charges.\n\nHutson, who declined an interview request, never showed an ounce of distress in court. She would occasionally turn around and reassuringly look at several supporters in the room, seemingly a woman confident in her defence. Sometimes, she pleasantly smiled.", "description": "Jenny Hutson was the corporate lawyer who made partner at 28, the founder of her own investment advisory firm, and a company director smashing glass ceilings.
