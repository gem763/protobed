Whilst California\u2019s privacy law will probably play out through enforcement much like the EGDPR - and that is taking some time - the looming threat of a fragmented US state-based privacy regulation system kicks data privacy into urgent and sharp focus.\n\nThe \"techlash\" is growing\n\nLast month, 51 tech CEOs including those from Amazon, AT &T, IBM, Dell and Salesforce sent a letter to Congress on behalf of the Business Roundtable (a non-profit association made up of CEOs from US companies), calling for a comprehensive federal consumer data privacy law. Urgently.\n\nThe catalyst was the CCPA and its instigator Alastair Mactaggart, described as America\u2019s most important privacy activist. Mactaggart, a Californian real estate developer, spent $3.1 million of his own money to make the CCPA happen in 2018. In so doing, he has focussed the attention of America\u2019s leading companies - many with global reach, and representing every sector of the economy - on the importance of data privacy to the consumer.\n\nMactaggart\u2019s agenda was simple: First, just do some good. Then: Do something about privacy. And then: Do something about data privacy. Mactaggart wants to give consumers transparency, control and accountability. To have the ability to demand what businesses know about them, as they can from any level of government via a Freedom of Information request.\n\nHanding consumers control of their data\n\nMactaggart wants consumers to be able to tell companies not to sell their personal information and to hold companies accountable to take good care of consumer\u2019s personal information. Mactaggart believes Big Tech\u2019s data use is out of control.\n\nGreta Thunberg last month said: \"We are not the ones who are responsible for this, but we are the ones who have to live with these consequences, and that is so incredibly unfair.\" Her words on climate change echo in Mactaggart\u2019s purpose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth unlikely activists are on the same hymn sheet. Whilst the drafting and ambiguity of the CCPA remains a contested issue, it is unarguable that Mactaggart has spearheaded action. It\u2019s a modern-day David and Goliath story, set in California. And he\u2019s not letting up.\n\nReshaping data's role in marketing\n\nNext up he wants consumers to control their \u201csensitive personal information\u201d - race, health, social security number and GPS locations. If ratified into law, consumers would have the right to prevent such data from being sold or used for advertising purposes.\n\nIt\u2019s yet another new squeeze for marketers. The complexity of the regulatory and legal framework around online tracking, data mining and privacy shows no respite - indeed it\u2019s fragmented for the foreseeable future: GDPR, CCPA, and closer to home, the Notifiable Data Breaches Act and the impending outcomes of the ACCC Digital Platforms Inquiry will continue spinning in their own orbits.\n\nMeanwhile, customers are demanding greater accountability. A US report by Express VPN found 89 per cent of Americans surveyed think they should be able to choose whether tech companies can share their online personal data.\n\nCost, complexity, compliance and customer are shaping as the new Marketing 4Cs. Still, Proctor & Gamble, the world\u2019s biggest advertiser, renewed its commitment to personalisation at the ANA conference. Marc Pritchard, P &G\u2019S chief brand officer and chair of the ANA, called for a reinvention of mass media via one-to-one precision through data, analytics and digital technology.\n\nIronically, it was Google\u2019s President of Brand Solutions, Kirk Perry, who tabled the sobering contradiction for 2020: \"how do we do more with less data?\"\n\nIs it time to rethink data, because personalisation and privacy seem to be uneasy bedfellows?\n\nSunita Gloster is chief customer officer at WPP AUNZ", "description": "Marketers are facing a patchwork of privacy regulations along state and country lines.
