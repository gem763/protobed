Malaysia won 3-2 with a goal in the seventh minute of stoppage time.\n\nFIFA warned Malaysia a first time for its fans' lack of discipline and throwing objects, and again for lack of order in its own stadium days later when hosting a qualifier against the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAfter crowd disturbances at Sierra Leone's home qualifier against Liberia last month, FIFA imposed a 50,000 Swiss francs ($50,250) fine and ordered a home game to be played in an empty stadium.\n\nSierra Leone was eliminated and the punishment should be served at a qualifying game for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nSudan's football federation was fined 30,000 Swiss francs ($30,150) for a pitch invasion by fans at a game against Chad.", "description": "Hong Kong's football body fined $15,100 after fans boo during Chinese national anthem at World Cup qualifying match.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/e3a9c1e88a7343b580df64f061046227_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
