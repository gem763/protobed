This certification comes on the heels of Transport Canada certification and entry-into-service on September 30.\n\n\u201cThis milestone is the latest accomplishment for our latest Global aircraft, which continue to exceed expectations on every level,\u201d said Michel Ouellette, Senior Vice President, Program Management and Engineering, Bombardier Aviation. \u201cObtaining Type Certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency Certification marks one of the final chapters in our very successful development program, and this achievement is a direct result of the commitment to excellence of the highly-skilled employees who worked on the program and our solid collaboration with our suppliers.\u201d\n\nThe aircraft went through the rigorous flight testing program, which was completed at Bombardier\u2019s world-class test centre in Wichita, Kansas. The Pearl 15 engine, the latest addition to Rolls-Royce\u2019s exceptional business aviation engine portfolio, was developed at the Rolls-Royce Centre of Excellence for Business Aviation engines in Dahlewitz, Germany, and was custom-designed with the most innovative technology \u2013 including enhanced aerodynamics, blade cooling and advanced engine health monitoring systems \u2013 to power the Global 5500 and Global 6500 aircraft. With the purpose-built engines, advanced wing design and built-in systems redundancy and robustness for which Bombardier Global aircraft are renowned, the aircraft offer superior safety and a smooth ride to its passengers.\n\nEquipped with the revolutionary Bombardier Vision Flight Deck, the industry\u2019s leading cockpit featuring the latest technology, the aircraft offer a comprehensive avionics suite with ergonomics and aesthetics that provide pilots with outstanding comfort and control.\n\nThese new aircraft build on the success of the Global 5000 and Global 6000 aircraft by offering 500 and 600 nautical miles of additional range, respectively, coupled with an up to 13-per-cent fuel burn advantage, contributing to highly favorable operating costs versus smaller competing aircraft with less range. The Global 5500 aircraft can connect Sao Paolo and Paris, and Moscow and Los Angeles; the Global 6500 aircraft can connect Hong Kong or Singapore and London, and Toluca and Madrid*.\n\nTo celebrate this momentous occasion, media are invited to join Bombardier at an event at the company\u2019s static display (SD 701) co-hosted with Rolls-Royce, on Tuesday, October 22, 2019, at 2:00 p.m. at NBAA-BACE, in Las Vegas, NV.\n\nAbout Bombardier\n\nWith over 68,000 employees, Bombardier is a global leader in the transportation industry, creating innovative and game-changing planes and trains.
