Buterin, without hesitation, commented that he has all the reasons to disagree, that there were technical and economic details which were missing from the article published by Rubin.\n\nIn his post, Buterin explains the operation of the Ethereum Network, where the incentive of the Network depends on the fees, called \u2018gas\u2019, to be paid in ETH, to carry out transactions. Buterin goes on to explain the possibility of paying the \u2018gas\u2019 with a non-ETH asset, which is sometimes referred to as economic abstraction in the Ethereum Community. Due to this factor, it is possible to pay the fee of the Ethereum network without necessarily having ETH, which would make it unnecessary in the future to pay for transactions in the Ethereum network.\n\nHowever, Buterin commented on his post that the Ethereum community is considering two proposals in which, at protocol level, they would have the need to pay for it causing ETH to get burned. Vitalik Buterin explains these two proposals in more detail in his post.\n\nKoppelman fires back with a bet\n\nKoppelmann has not missed the opportunity to answer, acknowledging merit in Rubin\u2019s argument, since there is currently no hard requirement for gas in an Ethereum smart contract making it possible for a dApp with its own token to pay for gas in order to carry out smart contracts. However, Kopplemann commented that the whole argument falls apart as soon as ETH is required in some form to create blocks.\n\nI actually agree with 90% in here. However \u2013 the whole argument falls apart as soon as ETH is required in some form to create blocks (e.g. for staking in POS). Willing to take any bets that this will be the case. @JeremyRubin https://t.co/UYYED5iP8b \u2014 Martin K\u00f6ppelmann (@koeppelmann) September 3, 2018\n\nIs the collapse of ETH inevitable?\n\nIt should be noted that both blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have always had problems with scalability but the community is currently working on solving these. In Ethereum\u2019s case, the network has an updated plan (called forks).
