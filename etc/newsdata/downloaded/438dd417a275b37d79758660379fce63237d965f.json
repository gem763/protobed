Because every customer account could represent service to multiple residents or employees in a business, the number of people affected by the outages could be in the millions.\n\nClass-action lawsuit:California wildfire was caused by Pacific Gas & Electric\n\nLewis said PG&E anticipates the wind \"weather event\" will last through midday Thursday, with peak winds forecast to reach 60 to 70 mph at higher elevations. Nearly all nine counties in the San Francisco Bay Area could be subjected to the shutdowns, the only exception being the city and county of San Francisco.\n\nPG&E has been under intense scrutiny since November, when the deadliest and most devastating wildfire in state history roared through Butte County. California fire officials determined the blaze, which killed 85 people and destroyed more than 10,000 homes, was ignited by the company's transmission lines.\n\nThe lantern section is nearly empty at an ACE Hardware store as shoppers prepare for possible power shutoffs in Los Gatos, Calif., Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019.

The blackout warning hasn't played well, however \u2014 the company's website crashed amid heavy traffic, preventing subscribers from finding information about the blackouts.\n\nThe state is bracing for another severe wildfire \"season,\" although officials say that season has become just about year-round. PG&E ordered a much smaller power cutoff in June involving thousands of customers in the Northern California counties of Napa, Solano and Yolo.\n\nRead this: In Paradise, wildfire victims rush to meet deadline for claims against PG&E\n\nOn Tuesday, Cal Fire issued a fire warning across much of the state.\n\n\"There is a #RedFlagWarning for most of Northern California and #FireWeatherWatch for the southernmost region of California from Wednesday morning to Thursday evening due to gusty winds and low humidity,\" Cal Fire warned on Twitter. \"This is #CriticalFireWeather and caution should be taken when outdoors.\"\n\nThere is a #RedFlagWarning for most of Northern California and #FireWeatherWatch for the southernmost region of California from Wednesday morning to Thursday evening due to gusty winds and low humidity.

Siemens said the outages scare her children, who were traumatized during the massive Paradise blaze, and also affect the family's cleaning business.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the power lines that they have to do this so much?\u201d asked Siemens. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any more fires, obviously, but I feel like they are going a little overboard.\u201d\n\nContributing: Jorge L.
