For all its brutal one-against-many forest combat, it was a character study of sorts in which Rambo had to relive his \u2018Nam trauma\u2014and in doing so, come to grips with it.\n\nAlas, he did no such thing, as evidenced by Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) and Rambo III (1988), blockbuster follow-ups that dispensed with any serious interest in Rambo\u2019s deep-seated issues. Instead, they transformed him into a one-man Stars-and-Stripes wrecking crew capable of, respectively, victoriously re-waging the Vietnam War and defeating the Soviets in Afghanistan (alongside the pre-Taliban mujahideen, no less).\n\nRambo (2008) stripped away much of the character\u2019s pro-American nature\u2014he was now just a loner saving missionaries and civilians from vicious Burmese baddies\u2014but to little avail. Having long since become a symbol of gung-ho steroidal Reaganism (the Gipper even famously gave him a shout-out), the film still argued that violence was the only answer, albeit in nastier-than-usual form. Similar to his later performances as his other icon, Rocky Balboa, Stallone tried, with his fourth outing as the bandana-wearing badass, to transform Rambo back from an American superhero cartoon to a broken-down, flesh-and-blood warrior. Yet the gesture was all pretense. A lifelong conservative (and Trump supporter), Stallone ultimately can\u2019t resist making Rambo a reactionary action figure who solves the world\u2019s problems with a gun, a bow and arrow, and his supersized phallic hunting knife.\n\nWhich brings us to Last Blood, a film that doesn\u2019t feature Rambo learning the error of his brutal ways (spoiler alert?), but does have him facing a Hispanic threat designed to prove the president\u2019s claim that we need to Build That Wall. Living a rancher\u2019s life in his childhood Arizona home, grizzled Rambo spends his days training horses and, by the looks of his massive, vein-bulging physique, shooting up steroids and working out like a fiend. He also cares for his niece Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal), who\u2019s about to head off to college. First, though, she decides that she must meet the father who abandoned her and her mom years earlier. When a friend calls with information about his Mexican whereabouts, Gabrielle floats the idea to Rambo and her grandmother. They object (the guy was apparently an abusive horror), but she sneaks off anyway to confront him.\n\nThe generic Mexican slum she visits is full of graffiti-covered buildings, trash-strewn streets, barking dogs and scary-looking locals, and after a thoroughly unrewarding chat with her dad, virginal Gabrielle is abducted and forced into prostitution by a gang led by brothers Victor (\u00d3scar Jaenada) and Hugo Martinez (Sergio Peris-Mencheta). They\u2019re villainous caricatures who equate their captives with dogs and shoot them up with drugs, and when Rambo hears that Gabrielle has ignored his wishes and gone missing, he naturally takes it upon himself to rescue her. That doesn\u2019t initially go as planned, resulting in both him and Gabrielle receiving a horrid \u201cV\u201d carved into their cheeks by Victor. Last Blood, however, barely tries to pretend Rambo won\u2019t eventually get payback for his innocent niece\u2019s defilement at the hands of these creeps, whose sadism (and their country\u2019s lawlessness) is intended to make Americans think they\u2019d be best off barricading themselves from their raping-and-murdering southern neighbors.\n\nLeadenly scripted by Stallone and Matt Cirulnick, Last Blood often plays like thinly veiled political propaganda aimed at red-state moviegoers. For those with simply carnage on their minds, meanwhile, director Adrian Grunberg provides the goods, and in a manner that\u2019s mostly in line with 2008\u2019s Rambo\u2014which is to say, his set pieces are chockablock with impalements, stabbings, beheadings, and shotgun blasts that literally detonate adversaries\u2019 noggins. Most of this takes place during a videogame-ish finale in which Rambo fends off a siege at his home, which he\u2019s booby-trapped with deadly traps that would make Macaulay Culkin\u2019s Kevin McCallister hurl. There\u2019s something altogether noxious about Stallone\u2019s fondness for gratuitous violence here, epitomized by Rambo not only dispatching enemies with extreme prejudice but then repeatedly shooting up their corpses for psychotic measure.\n\nBecause he\u2019s \u201ccrazy\u201d (yes, we have to put up with one brief \u2018Nam flashback), Rambo has built a network of interconnected tunnels beneath his house, presumably as a safeguard against the very sort of \u201cThe Mexicans Are Coming!\u201d menace that befalls him. Last Blood doesn\u2019t even try to sugarcoat its exploitative ugliness; at every turn, including the wholly needless death of a key character, the film trades in cheap fearmongering and gruesomeness. Moreover, it celebrates revenge as a noble and necessary end unto itself, with Rambo getting back at those that have harmed him and his loved ones simply because (as he tells Paz Vega\u2019s plot-device journalist), they deserve to suffer, and he wants to watch them do it\u2014and, Stallone assumes, we want to watch that as well.\n\nFittingly for a soldier who can\u2019t stop reliving past American failures in order to come out on top the second time around, Rambo gets his very own Alamo to win in Last Blood\u2014against, notably, the very types of Mexican \u201cmonsters\u201d that our present commander-in-chief warns are intent on overrunning (and overtaking) our nation. Stallone looks creaky and inexpressive throughout, his movements as wooden as his fury is excessive. Yet even more than its star\u2019s tortured-He-Man routine and its grisly action (topped off by a closing kill that\u2019s absurdly over-the-top), it\u2019s the film\u2019s ghastly worldview that\u2019s truly archaic, and in need of retirement.", "description": "Yes, Sylvester Stallone\u2019s Vietnam veteran John Rambo has gone full MAGA (just like the real Sly).", "authors": ["Nick Schager"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568928514/190920-schager-rambo-last-blood-hero_w59xf6", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
