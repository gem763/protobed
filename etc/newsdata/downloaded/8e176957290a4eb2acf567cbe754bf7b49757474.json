She\u2019d had a sleepless night and was vomiting.\n\n\"We took her to A&E but they sent us home, saying she only had a tummy bug.\n\n\"I didn't know the symptoms of meningitis at the time. But within about three hours of leaving A&E, she was rushed back in after she started getting a rash.\n\n\"When we got back in the doctors then confirmed our worst fears.\"\n\nThe family was forced to watch their little one struggle as she was taken into intensive care.\n\nAlthough, her mum pleaded with doctors for them to find another way to save her child she was told that it was a life or death situation and Brogan needed to lose her left foot.\n\n(Image: Handout)\n\n\"We\u2019re so lucky that she was saved but we were devastated when Brogan had to have her left foot amputated due to the septicaemia.\n\n\"The damage was done within just a few hours, but only time will tell how much the disease will affect her life.\n\n\"We were later told told she will need to have her right foot amputated too.\n\n\"When we first found out she was going to lose her legs, we thought there was absolutely no way that could happen.\n\n\"I didn't want my little girl to lose her legs but it was the only option.\"\n\nFour years on and brave Brogan, now aged 11, is working on rebuilding her life and becoming independent once again.\n\nHer mum praised her for her positive attitude towards everything life has thrown at her.\n\nShe said: \"She was completely oblivious to it all because she was so heavily medicated at the time.\n\n\"Her education suffered because of it. But now she's 11, she's adjusted to everything really well.\n\n\"She's always had a good mindset and is determined to get her full independence back.\"\n\nMrs Partridge added she wants to urge parents to be more aware of the symptoms of the potentially deadly condition, as little Brogan tries to reclaim her independence.\n\n(Image: Handout)\n\nA new survey has revealed many parents do not understand the complications of a meningitis infection.\n\nIn a study by health-care company, GSK, it was revealed that the majority of parents weren't aware that the most common type of bacterial meningitis in the UK is Meningitis B.\n\nMore than half said that they had little or no knowledge that vaccines could help prevent some forms of meningitis.\n\nThe results also revealed that 62 per cent of teenagers said they didn't know which vaccines they had received, or if they had even been vaccinated at all.\n\nRob Dawson, Director of Support and Communications for Meningitis Research Foundation, said: \u201cMeningitis acts quickly and is difficult to spot.\n\n\"In the early stages in can be confused with flu but it can kill in less than 24 hours.\n\n\"The consequences of bacterial meningitis can be devastating: 1 in 10 will die and many more are left with life-changing impairments, such as brain injury or amputations.\n\n\"That\u2019s why it is so vital for people to get their vaccines.\u201d", "description": "WARNING - DISTRESSING CONTENT: Brogan-Lei Partridge, of Birmingham contracted meningitis after a family holiday - and now her mum is warning of the danger signs", "authors": ["Brendan Mcfadden", "Kirsty Card", "Image", "Handout"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20569609.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brogan-Lei.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
