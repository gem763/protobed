Japan won bronze with a time of 37.43 seconds, an Asian record.\n\nJoining Coleman and Lyles, the two rising stars on the global sprint scene, were veterans in Justin Gatlin, twice world champion, and 34-year-old Mike Rodgers, who had never before stood atop a world championship or Olympic podium.\n\nAfter a wobbly performance in the heats in which Canada filed a protest against the U.S. for failing to make a proper exchange, the American quartet had a meeting to ensure there were no hiccups in the final.\n\nVictims of sloppy exchanges and dropped batons over the years, the message came through loud and clear as the United States made four clean exchanges in a polished effort to come home just outside Jamaica\u2019s world record 36.84. \u201cWe had a meeting in the morning,\u201d said Coleman, who also heads home with two golds. \u201cWe just got to come together, everybody just got to execute, focus on what they need to do, have an open dialogue about what went wrong in the prelims and what we are going to do better in the final.\n\n\u201cIf you never have that conversation then you are just going to go there and you kind of can\u2019t expect different results,\u201d Coleman added. \u201cSo we just got to talk about what we needed to do and everybody locked in and we got it done.\u201d\n\nReuters", "description": "A United States quartet led by Christian Coleman blazed to the 4x100m relay title at the world athletics championships on Saturday, clocking the second fastest time ever at 37.10 seconds to end a 12-year gold medal drought.", "authors": ["Steve Keating"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/06/11/Noah-Lyles.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
