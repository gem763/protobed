Most other women in the village told me the same thing.\" Navesh Chitrakar, Reuters photographer\n\n\u201cNo, I will not send my daughters to practice chaupadi\u201d, said 22-year-old Muna Devi Saud as she stood outside her house in the hills of Legudsen Village \u2013 one of many small settlements in the remote Achham District of far western Nepal.\n\nIn isolated regions like this, chaupadi has been a custom for centuries. But those from Nepal\u2019s cities or from abroad often don\u2019t know what it means.\n\nChaupadi is the practice of treating women as impure and untouchable when they menstruate. When they go through their monthly cycle, they are not allowed to enter a house or pass by a temple. They cannot use public water sources, touch livestock, attend social events like weddings, or touch others. When they are served food, the person who gives it to them will not even touch the dish. And at night, they are not allowed to sleep in their homes \u2013 instead they have to stay in sheds or outbuildings, often with no proper windows or doors.\n\nThe practice is the same whether it\u2019s March 8 or any other time of the year. I think that many women from Legudsen Village and other settlements in remote western Nepal don\u2019t even know that International Women\u2019s Day exists.\n\nThey do, however, know all about the concepts of Family, Culture, Community and Fear of God, which have prevented them from taking a stand and breaking the tradition, even though they don\u2019t like chaupadi. They have accepted the practice and see it as part of their lives.\n\nAs I worked on this story, I met many women who had been affected by the tradition. One was 45-year-old Jamuna Devi Saud, who lives alone in a house in Legudsen village and isolates herself every month. She told me that she would be happy if she didn\u2019t have to stay in the shack when she menstruates, but chaupadi is part of the village\u2019s culture and she has to follow it.\n\nIf everyone else in the village stopped observing the custom, she would too, Jamuna said. Most other women in the village told me the same thing.\n\nChaupadi causes all sorts of problems for those who practice it. Uttara Saud, a shy 14-year-old girl, told me that she has to miss school during her monthly cycle. Dhuna Devi Saud told me that she finds it difficult to sleep in the shed outside because it gets so cold. The room she sleeps in during her period is not big enough to fit a bed, has no windows, and only a tiny door. There are wild animals living in the hills around, and the shed does not offer much protection.\n\nBut not everyone follows the tradition. I met Rupa Chand Shah, a schoolteacher who used to observe the custom but decided to stop. One of her life\u2019s regrets was that she could not attend her younger brother\u2019s wedding because she was menstruating. Now, Rupa does not miss school during her period and she has set an example to some others in the village - her students come to class, even during their cycle.\n\nAs I worked on this story, I realised that chaupadi does not just bring discomfort and isolation to the women practicing it \u2013 sometimes they even have to pay with their lives. Isolated and poorly protected from the elements, they can be killed by snake bites, freezing weather, wild animal attacks, or fires they light to keep warm, which can cause blazes or suffocation in small sheds with poor ventilation. There have also been cases of these women, cut off from their families, being the victims of rape.\n\nAccording to Gopi Singh Nepali \u2013 a program officer with the governmental women and children\u2019s office \u2013 in Achham District alone seven women have been reported dead while observing the tradition. More casualties have gone undocumented, he said.\n\nGopi works with the government office to educate women about reproductive health \u2013 including the dangers of chaupadi. Based in Bailpata Village, not far from Legudsen, he says that there has been around a 50 percent improvement in the local areas where the government organisation is located, but in the villages without any official presence, everyone still observes the practice. This is despite the fact that Nepal\u2019s supreme court declared chaupadi illegal in 2005.\n\nI attended one of the training workshops that Gopi runs and saw two girls dancing to a beautiful song, sung and written by 20-year-old Mahaswari Nagarjri, asking for the practice of chaupadi to be ended.\n\nOne of the dancers was Sanu Bhul, who told me that her cousin Sarmila Bhul lost her life a year ago while observing chaupadi. On my request, Sanu escorted me to Ridikot village and showed me the shed where her cousin died. It was abandoned after her death and has never been used again.\n\nWhile in the village, I met Sarmila\u2019s father Yagraj, her mother Ishwora, and her grandmother Moti. I asked them about Sarmila and they said she was a healthy girl, who was very good at her studies and did not used to get afraid. They showed me an album that had Sarmila\u2019s picture in it. She died when she was just 15.\n\nYagraj, the head of the family, said the cause of Sarmila\u2019s death was still unknown. He said that the day Sarmila was found dead inside her shed, he called her and she didn\u2019t answer. Worried, he kicked the door to break in and found his daughter lying as if she were asleep, covered with a blanket. Yagraj showed me how she was lying. Then he said he touched her and she was cold. He realised that she was dead.\n\nYagraj said there was no postmortem because there were no doctors in the village to perform it. For Sarmila\u2019s body to be examined, she would have had to be taken to Doti, a nearby city, which would cost him 15,000 Nepalese Rupees (around $150) - money he didn\u2019t have.\n\nYagraj has seven daughters but since Sarmila\u2019s death none of them practice chaupadi, and nor does his wife.\n\nAs I spoke with Sarmila\u2019s family, her grandmother Moti started to cry. \u201cI used to love her a lot but she left us and taught us a lesson that \u2018chaupadi\u2019 is not a good practice,\u201d she said.", "description": "Once a month, Dhuna Devi Saud sleeps in a tiny shack with no windows and very little to protect her from animals roaming the hills outside.", "authors": ["Navesh Chitrakar"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ-iUnb37JMczI1VY9TcD_shBv47jmjdQdPI1OT9uc0JaI31FAn6mak3Yr947VvL8a6GDl3kCl-0664o6TJ9EJQKmARRg94diAz_ngIN1I6pT"}
