His U.K. opposite number Boris Johnson had bailed out of a planned press conference because of a few dozen noisy protesters.\n\nBettel's grandstanding performance gave voice to a catalogue of EU grievances that have festered behind the scenes for more than three years as diplomats have watched the Brexit mess in London go from bad to worse. In the process, his display of pent-up fury made him a pin-up for U.K. Remainers and Continent-wide Europhiles to boot.\n\nBut the 46-year-old Luxembourg leader's opportunistic strike was entirely in keeping with his live-by-your-wits approach to running the EU's second smallest nation. Landlocked, and without the territorial and geographical advantages of other EU members, Luxembourg has had to find niches at which to excel.\n\nA descendant of Sergei Rachmaninoff, Bettel leads a country of about 600,000 people that sits at the heart of Europe.\n\nAs Europe's richest state by GDP per capita, the Grand Duchy's focus on financial services has paid off handsomely. But Bettel isn't resting on his laurels. With new ventures such as an attempt to own the future market in legal services for ownership in space and setting up the world's first data embassy, he is looking for new niches in which the country can succeed. And although he says he turned down an offer of one of the EU's top jobs in the recent changing of the Brussels guard, many believe his own personal ambitions are not constrained by his country's tiny size.\n\nBrexit megaphone\n\nIn a wide ranging interview with POLITICO, a few days before his remarkable Brexit diatribe, Bettel voiced nearly identical anger and frustration over Brexit. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a disunited Kingdom that we have at the moment, there\u2019s no United Kingdom anymore,\" he said, adding that Brexit was \"a problem of the Tories, to keep internal peace.\u201d\n\nBut it is not just on Brexit that Bettel has seized his chance to grab the limelight.\n\nAt the first EU-Arab League summit in Egypt earlier this year, he spoke out forcefully in support of gay rights and marriage equality. It was hardly a friendly audience but he later tweeted, \"saying nothing was not an option for me.\"\n\nIn a similar show of pride, and confidence, he took his husband, the Belgian architect Gauthier Destenay, to a meeting two years ago with Pope Francis at the Vatican.\n\nDespite the obvious differences with Johnson, some diplomats say Bettel has similarities with the U.K. leader \u2014 exceptional communication skills and a willingness to disregard convention. But while British critics have accused Bettel of boosting his image at Johnson\u2019s expense, he seeks to play down any sense that his actions \u2014 or the mere fact that he is a gay head of government \u2014 are somehow groundbreaking.\n\n\u201cFor me it was not history. For me it was fully normal,\" he said of the Vatican meeting. \"I have pictures with Angela [Merkel] and [her husband] Mister Sauer and my husband in the Chapelle Sixtine, I love that.\"\n\n\"I'm not the gay prime minister,\" he added, mixing French and English, \"but a prime minister who happens to be gay.\"\n\nA descendant of Sergei Rachmaninoff (his mother was the Russian composer's grandniece), Bettel leads a country of about 600,000 people that sits at the heart of Europe between France and Germany. Its former leaders \u2014 probably also because of that accident of geography \u2014 have also found themselves at the heart of the EU, with three going on to be presidents of the European Commission (Gaston Thorn, Jacques Santer and the incumbent, Jean-Claude Juncker).\n\nBettel says he is not upset that no Luxemburger is in line for a top EU position this time around (it's \u201ca little break,\u201d he joked). And he rejects suggestions that he has an eye on a future in Brussels: \u201cI am elected here. I started a job, I wanted to modernize my country, and my job is not finished. \u201d\n\nBut the Luxembourg PM revealed that as leaders struggled to find the right top jobs mix he was asked if he would put his hat in the ring. \u201cI was very pleased to be asked because it's an honor to be asked.\u201d\n\nUltimately though, he stuck with his own choice for European Council president, his friend Charles Michel, the Belgian prime minister. \u201cFriendship in politics, it's just not very common,\u201d he said.\n\n(Fiscal) paradise lost\n\nMarking a difference with his predecessor, Bettel has left Juncker's small office in the prime minister's building and relocated to nearby premises that, until recently, were occupied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the walls there is contemporary art from his own collection.\n\nThe financial sector is the main engine of the country\u2019s economy, accounting for 25 percent of GDP but Bettel said Luxembourg no longer encourages sharp practice. In a good mood, and sporting a beard, he was keen to stress that the country is no longer a tax haven. \u201cUnder my government my country disappeared from black and gray lists,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a good decision of my government.\u201d\n\n\"[French President] Emmanuel Macron visited here and said that if someone is speaking about tax haven in Luxembourg [they don't] know the country,\u201d he boasted.\n\n\u201cWe are one of the very few countries who did legislation to be able to extract the asteroids in space.\" \u2014 Xavier Bettel, Luxembourg's Prime Minister\n\nWhile the European Commission agrees that there has been progress, its latest report on the country did not give it a clean bill of health. The country\u2019s \u201ctax rules appear to be used by multinationals engaged in aggressive tax planning structures, but some steps are being taken to limit such practices,\u201d the report read.\n\nMore mundanely, the country's main problems remain \u201cheavy traffic congestion and insufficient housing supply [that] may also be negatively affecting the country\u2019s attractiveness,\" the report concluded. Bettel replied that this is an issue especially for the middle class, excluded from social housing and market prices, but he stressed that \u201cwe need to do affordable housing, and so that's what we did,\u201d explaining how he personally intervened to lower the costs of some projects.\n\nInstead of undercutting its neighbours on tax, Bettel said he is trying to steer the country towards capitalising on the green economy (by promoting green finance) and digitalization. Estonia, for example, has opened a \"data embassy\" on Luxembourg soil \u2014 essentially a bank of servers where Tallinn can store sensitive data outside of its borders, but with the same legal protections a traditional embassy would enjoy.\n\n\u201cWe did legislation so that the data center is considered as an embassy, with all the privileges of an embassy,\u201d said Bettel, adding that the Baltic state was \u201cthe first one, but now we have other countries, other institutions who have the data embassy here.\u201d\n\nAnother exotic and forward-thinking punt that plays to the country's strengths as a legal center is Luxembourg's bold pitch to be the international legal broker for space ownership.\n\n\u201cWe are one of the very few countries who did legislation to be able to extract the asteroids in space. And so we have a lot of start-ups and companies moving to Luxembourg also in that activity,\" said Bettel, adding that he had also signed an agreement with the U.S. on the subject.\n\nIn short, Bettel's plan is to turn his niche country into a country of niches: \u201cI need to be able always to find new niches, where you are able to to develop niches.\u201d As any smart investor knows, portfolio diversification is key: \u201cIf you think that one sector is enough, the day you have a crisis in that sector, your country is broken.\u201d\n\nLuxembourger in New York\n\nIn his spare time, Luxembourg's leader says he likes to read crime novels (John Grisham is a favorite), or biographies. The last one was on French King Louis XIV. While at work he usually listens to classical music. Which composer? \u201cI won't say Rachmaninoff because this was too easy.\u201d\n\nIn the next few days though, he will likely have little spare time as he prepares to travel to the annual U.N. General Assembly in New York.\n\n\u201cI didn't prepare [my speech] yet but I think I will speak a lot about the environment because [it] is really a top priority for my country. And I think that this will be the very important topic for me.\" Also on the list of subjects he wants to touch on is rule of law.\n\nBut Bettel knows from previous U.N. gatherings that he can't necessarily bank on the global attention he received this week. \"Everything is full,\" he said, when the leaders of big countries like Brazil or the U.S. speak, but he noted wryly that he can't offer the same pulling power.\n\n\"I remember the first time I had to speak. There was some stress ... so many persons. And then I had to go up. And I saw that the Luxembourgish bench was the only one that was complete,\u201d he laughs.\n\nDon't bank on Bettel not finding some way to grab the limelight though.", "description": "In an exclusive interview with POLITICO, the Luxembourg prime minister explains his vision of a \u2018country of niches.\u2019", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Florian Eder", "Charlie Cooper"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1175050804-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
