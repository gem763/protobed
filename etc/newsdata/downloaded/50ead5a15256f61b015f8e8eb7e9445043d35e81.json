There are interesting statistics: According to the National Chicken Council, in 1976, total per capita beef consumption in the United States was 94 pounds; chicken was 42. Last year, beef was 57 pounds and chicken consumption rose to almost 94 pounds per person. So, overall, American consumers have swapped out beef in favor of chicken.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut that does not tell the whole story, says Kim McLynn of the market research firm NPD Group. Sales of beef burgers, at 6.4 billion annually, are triple those of chicken sandwiches. Beef burgers declined by less than 1 percent last year, attributable partly to the rise of plant-based meats like Impossible Burger and Beyond Meat. Chicken sandwiches\u2019 market share, 2.2 billion sandwiches, moved up only 3 percent.\n\nFor fast food, beef is still king.\n\nSome of this is because of demographics and lifestyle changes, says David Portalatin, vice president and food industry adviser for NPD.\n\nEighty percent of what we eat over the course of a day is sourced from our own refrigerators and pantries, he says. But if you look at where we get our hamburgers, the numbers are nearly flipped, with 69 percent coming from a restaurant. A lot of that is because of burgers\u2019 longtime running mate, the french fry. We love to eat them; we hate to cook them at home.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe consume a lot of chicken at home. It\u2019s a center-of-the-plate protein, in a casserole or a baked dish. We don\u2019t consume them at home as chicken sandwiches,\u201d Portalatin says.\n\nHe says beef burgers are the most-ordered restaurant item now, as they were 10 years ago and, he predicts, will be 10 years from now: \u201cI assure you the burger is alive and well and will be for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nBoomers are retiring and thus not going to an office, and many more people are working remotely from home. More restaurant food is being consumed at home \u2014 whether via delivery or takeout \u2014 and this pulls for the convenience of portability and \u201chandholds.\u201d\n\nSandwiches.\n\nAD\n\nWings and other bone-in chicken parts are messier, harder to eat in the car. And they remind us of the animals they came from, a fact, says Portalatin, that millennials and Gen Z may be squeamish about. A breaded, boneless, skinless chicken sandwich is more divorced from something with feathers. Also, because each bird has only two wings, the rise of \u201cboneless wings\u201d (frequently strips of boneless, skinless breast) and chicken tenders is about restaurant chains managing their cost and being assured of sufficient supply.\n\nAD\n\nSo what are the chicken sandwich wars about?\n\n\u201cThis whole thing is not about chicken sandwiches,\u201d Portalatin says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the virality of the story. And it\u2019s a reflection of the performance of chains like Chick-fil-A.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd about Popeyes running out of chicken and buns?\n\nNick Reader, chief executive and co-founder of the regional chicken chain PDQ, says that might have been a little bit of theatrics.\n\n\u201cFrozen chicken never runs out. You\u2019re not seeing a chicken shortage anywhere in the country. If you\u2019re selling something that is making money, you figure out a way to produce it,\u201d Reader says.\n\nHe says the Popeyes chicken sandwich will be a case study in how to launch a limited-time offer, but warns that such offers may rebound against the company if they extend the drive-through speed. If a product launch is so huge that it taxes workers and alienates some core customers, a pause or discontinuation may be in order.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nReader says this launch was hugely successful because it created discussion and content, and got current customers to change their shopping pattern and new people to try. Then pulling the product and relaunching gave Popeyes an opportunity for more content.\n\nBut it was the social media interaction between the three fast-food giants that heightened the excitement level. Wendy\u2019s, he says, is digitally edgy, and with this reboot, for Popeyes to go after Chick-fil-A, which he calls \u201cthe sacred cow,\u201d captured customers\u2019 attention.\n\n\u201cTo go after them and be funny about it? It\u2019s impressive as an overall campaign,\u201d Reader says.\n\nThe number of chicken-only or chicken-forward restaurants has risen in the past several years, a response to the perception that chicken is healthier than beef. But on menus overall, according to an NPD study, burgers are included in 14.1 percent of all restaurant orders, and chicken sandwiches in 6.5 percent of orders. Poultry won\u2019t rule the roost any time soon.\n\nAD", "description": "So what are the chicken sandwich wars about?", "authors": ["Laura Reiley", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Food"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2ej0ofyefrx3-ok_sDGa_T0pobg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GJ4S7YWFDYI6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
