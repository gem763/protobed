Greg Garcia was aboard on a leadoff double.\n\n\u201cI was trying him over. He\u2019s at second, trying to get a team at-bat going and just kind of happened he hung me a slider and I got it.\u201d\n\nMejias-Brean earned the promotion after putting up big numbers at Triple-A.\n\n\u201cI know the guys in there are going nuts over it,\u201d Barajas said.\n\n\u201cUp until this year, he did not have an opportunities,\u201d Barajas said. \u201cTo see a guy who was labeled \u2018Doing everything the right way, absolute professional,\u2019 get the opportunity, and take advantage of it and shine a little bit, it\u2019s been an honor to see him go out there and play, actually.\u201d\n\nBarajas, a former big league catcher who had been in his first season as Padres bench coach, said his first win \u201cwas great. It\u2019s only for these eight games, but it still means something. I enjoy this opportunity. I\u2019m trying to take advantage of it. I\u2019m trying to help these guys win baseball games. They were probably more excited than I was. I got a beer shower and all that good stuff. I had to do a costume change before I came out here. It was fun. It was awesome.\u201d\n\nBarajas was promoted Saturday after Andy Green was fired. The Padres lost Saturday night, 4-2.\n\nThe Padres avoided a three-game sweep and pushed the Diamondbacks closer to elimination from the wild-card race. Arizona is six games back of the Washington Nationals and Milwaukee Brewers, who are tied for the two NL wild cards.\n\nMatt Strahm (6-10) pitched a perfect 10th for the win.\n\nPadres center fielder Manuel Margot leaped at the fence to rob Christian Walker of a two-run home run to end the seventh.\n\nThe Diamondbacks took a 4-0 lead in the second against Garrett Richards but were held in check by San Diego\u2019s bullpen.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t close out a deal and you\u2019re playing a good baseball game for the first half and get a little inconsistent, it\u2019s a little bit frustrating,\u201d manager Torey Lovullo said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with right now. It was a tough loss to absorb, especially watching the way things unfolded in the 10th inning. I keep saying it, no matter what the circumstances, we need to regroup the troops and be ready to play a clean baseball game tomorrow.\u201d\n\nArizona lefty Robbie Ray struck out 10 in 5 1/3 innings, but also allowed four runs and three hits, with four walks.\n\nHe said the strikeouts were \u201cnice; it just stinks that we lost today. It\u2019s tough to kind of step back and evaluate it. Anytime we lose, looking at stuff like that is not a priority.\u201d\n\nRichards didn\u2019t get out of the second inning in his Petco Park debut after allowing four runs in the span of seven batters. Walker drew a leadoff walk and San Diegan Adam Jones hit a two-run home run with one out, his 16th. Nick Ahmed followed with a triple and scored on Carson Kelly\u2019s single. After Robbie Ray\u2019s sacrifice, Abraham Almonte hit an RBI double.\n\nRichards walked Josh Rojas and was replaced by Javy Guerra, who got Eduardo Escobar to ground out on his first pitch to end the inning.\n\nSan Diego\u2019s Ty France hit a two-run homer in the fourth off Ray, his seventh.\n\nThe Padres tied it in the sixth, when Ray put two runners on before striking out Luis Urias and then making way for Matt Andriese. He got the second out but then allowed an RBI single by rookie Seth Mejia-Brean and an RBI double by pinch-hitter Francisco Mejia.\n\nRichards, who made his second start in his return from Tommy John surgery, allowed four runs and four hits, struck out two and walked two.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDiamondbacks: LHP Alex Young (7-4, 3.27) is scheduled to start the opener of a three-game home series against the St. Louis Cardinals on Monday night.\n\nPadres: Rookie RHP Ronald Bola\u00f1os is scheduled to start Tuesday night\u2019s opener of the final home series, against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n__\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rookie Seth Mejias-Brean got a sports drink shower at home plate after hitting his first career walkoff home run, leading to a beer shower in the clubhouse for Rod Barajas after his first victory as interim manager of the San Diego Padres.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/diamondbacks_padres_baseball_99324_c0-301-3767-2497_s1770x1032.jpg?c3bd6dc957526ee8f4b0ff37d40ec804aaaba60d", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
