That would help facilitate transmission, he said.\n\nHe sees it as unlikely the central bank will buy residential mortgage-backed securities as issuance only sits at less than 2% of total bank mortgages, rendering purchases insufficient for influencing funding costs -- which quantitative easing seeks to achieve.\n\nREAD: QE Drumbeat Skews Toward Corporates, Mortgage Bonds\n\nIn a separate research report Tuesday, HSBC Holdings Plc (LON: ) Australian chief economist Paul Bloxham said it is more likely the RBA would buy sovereign bonds than MBS or commercial paper.\n\n\u201cWe see outright sovereign bond purchases as the most likely approach,\u201d said Bloxham, who previously worked at the central bank.", "description": "RBA Could Embark on Unorthodox Policies in February, Citi Says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic7acc28cc24e99a79fad2decc13e2d963.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
