When you say they\u2019re fighting with the US, yes. But they\u2019re fighting for their land.\u201d\n\nKurdish forces fought alongside the US against the Islamic State for nearly five years, losing roughly 11,000 fighters.\n\nTrump said he learned that the Kurds didn\u2019t help in Normandy from a \u201cvery, very powerful article\u201d, apparently referencing a column by conservative opinion writer Kurt Schlichter.\n\n\u201cAlliances are very easy. But our alliances have taken advantage of us,\u201d Trump also told reporters. Misrepresenting how Nato works, he added: \u201cIf you look at how much money we spend on Nato and how much countries from Europe who are a much bigger beneficiary than we are.\u201d\n\nTurkey on Wednesday launched an offensive into north-eastern Syria, targeting the US-backed Syrian Defense Forces (SDF), a Kurdish force that controls the region. The Turkish offensive came just days after a call between Trump and Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, after which Trump tweeted that US troops would withdraw from the region.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to abandon the Kurdish groups who have fought alongside the US in Syria has drawn bipartisan condemnation. Critics argue the move casts doubts about the US\u2019s commitments to its allies, could enable an Isis resurgence and raises fears that some of the thousand Isis fighters in Kurdish detention may escape.\n\nAt the White House, Trump told reporters that some of the \u201cmost dangerous\u201d Isis prisoners had been moved, but he did not say how many or where they had been taken.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting them in different locations where it\u2019s secure,\u201d he said.", "description": "President said he learned Kurds didn\u2019t help from a \u2018powerful article\u2019 as Turkey on Wednesday launched an offensive into north-eastern Syria", "authors": ["Maanvi Singh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a19acdbd22e16199a06ca63531eda1db3c012505/0_62_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f0701da729ba088100ab3ba8a651bc6a", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
