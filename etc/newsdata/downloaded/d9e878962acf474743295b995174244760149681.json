But a lot of people don\u2019t realize that tech products and services, whether that be sold to the enterprise or sold to the consumer, you know typically are cyclical.\u201d\n\nHence, Meeks is calling for a near-term drop on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.22% of 10%, which he says should give investors a chance to sniff out some deals. \u201cI always have my eye on my favorite tech names, and I look for opportunities to buy them on dips,\u201d he explained.\n\nBut those deals don\u2019t include tech juggernaut Apple AAPL, -1.94% , as he believes a secular slump in smartphones will weigh heavily.\n\nRead: Apple\u2019s new iPhones are overpriced and behind the times\n\n\u201cI would like to shift out of those names in this kind of environment and try to find some deals in software,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one that I like the most particularly as I exit Apple and increase in the software space is Salesforce.com.\u201d\n\nMeeks says Salesforce.com\u2019s CRM, -1.14% software business \u201cis growing faster and is much more profitable than anything that Apple is doing.\u201d\n\nThe chart\n\nNo brainer pick for the chart of the day: Crude prices CL.1, +9.92% went vertical at the open: Here\u2019s what a double-digit jump looks like in the oil pits:\n\nRead: Oil\u2019s set for biggest daily gain in 3\u00bd years after Saudi attack\n\nThe market\n\nAs oil goes nuts, sellers are flocking to safer assets. Futures on the Dow YM00, -0.39% , S&P ES00, -0.39% and Nasdaq NQ00, -0.66% are all feeling pressure ahead of the open. Gold GCZ19, +0.77% is capitalizing on the uncertainty with a move higher and the Japanese USDJPY, -0.27% yen is also bid higher.\n\nEurope stocks SXXP, -0.37% aren\u2019t doing much better, while Asia markets ADOW, +0.66% ended with losses. The dollar DXY, +0.19% is heading lower.\n\nThe tweet\n\nIt is now time for the U.S. to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries if they continue their provocations or increase nuclear enrichment. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 14, 2019\n\nThe buzz\n\nThe UAW announced on Sunday that more than 49,000 workers at General Motors GM, -0.54% plants in the U.S. would go on strike just before midnight because contentious talks on a new contract had broken down.\n\nPurdue Pharma, the U.S. company that made billions selling the prescription painkiller OxyContin, has filed for bankruptcy.\n\nChina delivered a batch of disappointing data, including industrial output and retail sales. China\u2019s premier Li Keqiang reportedly said it would be \u2018very difficult\u2019 for the economy to keep 6% growth going.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is pushing to enact a statewide ban on the sale of flavored e-cigarettes amid growing health concerns connected to vaping, especially among young people.\n\nThe quote\n\n\u201cI sat through those hearings. Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice\u201d \u2014 That was Sen. Kamala Harris and Democratic presidential candidate, tweeting about the latest allegations facing the Supreme Court justice.\n\nEven as President Trump rushed to his defense, others, like Bernie Sanders, joined Harris in calling for action:\n\nThe revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 15, 2019\n\nThe economy\n\nAugust housing starts and existing home sales data will be highlights this week, but we won\u2019t get a look at those numbers until Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
