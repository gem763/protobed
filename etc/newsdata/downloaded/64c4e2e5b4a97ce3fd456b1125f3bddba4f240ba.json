He declared a state of emergency over the nationwide protests last week.\n\nThe demonstrations broke out after increases of up to 120 percent in fuel prices came into force on October 3.\n\nThey have so far left one civilian dead and 77 people injured, the majority of them security forces, the government said. A total of 477 people have been detained.\n\n\u2013 Dialogue \u2013\n\nDiscussions with leaders of the powerful indigenous umbrella organization CONAIE took place in Guayaquil, some 170 miles (270 kilometres) southwest of the capital.\n\n\u201cThere is dialogue with the brother indigenous peoples who unfortunately have needs\u201d, Moreno said.\n\nHe also offered to free up resources for those hit hard by the rise in fuel prices.\n\nSeveral days of protests against the fuel price hike have slashed the South American country\u2019s oil output by a third, according to the Energy Ministry.\n\nProduction losses at the state-owned Petroamazonas \u201cwill reach 165,000 barrels per day,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. Ecuador, which exited the OPEC international oil cartel last week citing economic constraints, normally produces 531,000 barrels per day.\n\n\u2013 International support \u2013\n\nMoreno had accused his predecessor and ex-ally Rafael Correa along with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of an \u201cattempted coup d\u2019etat.\u201d\n\nHe said they were using \u201cindigenous groups, taking advantage of their mobilization to plunder and destroy\u201d, accusations Maduro dismissed as absurd.\n\nMoreno has drawn support however from seven Latin American countries that, in a joint statement rejected any effort by Maduro and his allies to \u201cdestabilize\u201d Ecuador.\n\nAll seven \u2014 which include Argentina, Brazil and Columbia \u2014 have right-wing governments that see Moreno\u2019s moderate socialist administration as an important regional ally against Venezuela.\n\n\u2013 \u201cNo coup\u201d \u2013\n\nCorrea meanwhile called for early elections, citing \u201cserious social upheaval,\u201d while denying he was attempting to oust Moreno.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no coup here. Conflicts in democracy are resolved at the polls,\u201d the Belgium-based Correa said in a video published on social media.\n\nMoreno scrapped fuel subsidies as part of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to obtain loans despite Ecuador\u2019s high public debt.\n\nThe subsidies were costing the government $1.3 billion a year.\n\nThe IMF agreement, signed in March, allowed Ecuador to borrow $4.2 billion.", "description": "Quito (AFP) \u2013 Ecuador\u2019s capital \u00a0braced for mass protests Wednesday despite talks between the government and indigenous leaders, as anger", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/6ed4a9_demonstrators-congress-in-quito-clashes-riot-police-ecuador-readies-mass-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
