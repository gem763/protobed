Using archival footage from interviews, GS&P pulled over 6,000 frames and used 1,000 hours of machine learning to train the AI algorithm on Dal\u00ed\u2019s face. His facial expressions were then imposed over an actor with Dal\u00ed\u2019s body proportions, and quotes from his interviews and letters were synced with a voice actor who could mimic his unique accent, a mix of French, Spanish, and English.\n\nThe experience is, well, surreal. Dal\u00ed appears before visitors when they press the doorbell on the kiosk where he lives, and he tells them stories about his life. With 45 minutes of newly created footage and thousands of combinations, each visitor gets a different experience. There are scenes that open with him reading the newspaper, with an overlay of the current front page of The New York Times; if it\u2019s raining, he\u2019ll comment on the weather. He\u2019s almost like an Alexa device.\n\nDali Lives aims to have visitors empathize with Dal\u00ed as a human being. Figures in art history often feel like they lived lifetimes ago. But Dal\u00ed died in 1989, and standing before visitors in a life-sized kiosk does help bring him into the context of modern life \u2014 especially at the end of the experience when he asks visitors if they want to take a selfie. He turns around and snaps the photo, and visitors can have the photo texted to them, almost like a photo booth I\u2019d like to rent for my next company function.\n\nDeepfake videos are usually associated with fake celebrity porn, the dangers that come from fake news, or the possibility of making political figures say volatile things. The technology is easily available for anyone to use. GS&P technical director Nathan Shipley, says he pulled the code from GitHub. Shipley believes that Dal\u00ed Lives may be the first time a cultural institution has used deepfakes for artistic purposes. It\u2019s hard to think of another artist who would be better suited for this than Dal\u00ed.\n\nThere are lots of moral arguments for and against bringing the dead back to life through technology. In the case of something like hologram Tupac, the Coachella performance was done with permission from the artist\u2019s estate. In Dal\u00ed\u2019s case, he has no living family, and instead named the Spanish Kingdom as the sole heir in his will, so the exhibition was run with permission from the Dal\u00ed Foundation in Spain.\n\nDal\u00ed Lives opens on May 11th as a permanent exhibition on what would have been his 115th birthday.", "description": "The Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, has brought Dali to life with a deepfake.
