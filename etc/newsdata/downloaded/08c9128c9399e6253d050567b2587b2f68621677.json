REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nCatherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, Ukraine specialists at the State Department, became the latest current and former U.S. officials called as witnesses in the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry against the Republican president in the House of Representatives.\n\nCroft said she was a member of the National Security Council (NSC) staff at the White House from July 2017 to July 2018.\n\n\u201cDuring my time at the NSC, I received multiple calls from lobbyist Robert Livingston, who told me that Ambassador Yovanovitch should be fired. He characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an \u2018Obama holdover\u2019 and associated with George Soros,\u201d Croft said in her opening statement to lawmakers, posted online by the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cIt was not clear to me at the time - or now - at whose direction or at whose expense Mr Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch,\u201d Croft said.\n\nShe said she told Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former top Russia adviser, and George Kent, a senior State Department Ukraine expert, but was \u201cnot aware of any action that was taken in response.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment inquiry focuses on a July 25 telephone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy to investigate political rival Joe Biden, the former U.S. vice president, and his son Hunter, who had served as a director for Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nTrump removed Yovanovitch as ambassador in May. Giuliani has said he went to Trump and the State Department as part of his effort to have her removed from the post at a time when he was seeking to persuade Ukraine to open an investigation of Biden, a contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 U.S. election.\n\nAnderson, in his opening statement seen by Reuters, also mentioned Giuliani\u2019s actions. Before Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration in May, Anderson said \u201cmy colleagues and I saw a tweet by Rudolph Giuliani\u201d alleging that Ukraine\u2019s incoming leader \u201cwas surrounded by enemies of President Trump.\u201d Anderson said he sought to counter the \u201cnegative narrative\u201d sparked by Yovanovitch\u2019s removal and Giuliani\u2019s statements.\n\nTrump made his request to Zelenskiy after withholding $391 million in security aid approved by Congress to help Ukraine fight Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskiy agreed to Trump\u2019s requests. The aid was later provided.\n\nAnderson and Croft described Trump\u2019s negative view toward Ukraine even as other State Department and White House officials underscored Kiev\u2019s importance to U.S. national security in the face of Russian aggression.\n\n(Graphic: The impeachment inquiry - here)\n\nRelated Coverage U.S. State Department official knew Trump attorney involved in campaign against ambassador\n\nSTATEMENT CONDEMNING RUSSIA\n\nAnderson said that in November 2018 Russia escalated the conflict when its forces attacked and seized Ukrainian military vessels heading to a Ukrainian port.\n\n\u201cWhile my colleagues at the State Department quickly prepared a statement condemning Russia for its escalation, senior officials in the White House blocked it from being issued,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nHe said Kurt Volker, at the time the U.S. special representative for Ukraine, drafted a tweet condemning Russia\u2019s actions, which he posted to his account.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine posed, and continues to pose, a real and immediate threat to our national interest in a Europe free, whole, and at peace,\u201d Croft said.\n\nShe said \u201cwe do not lose sight of what is happening in Ukraine and its great promise as a prosperous and democratic member of the European community.\u201d\n\nLater on Wednesday, the House Rules Committee is scheduled to take up a resolution proposed by House Democrats laying out the procedures as they move forward with impeachment of Trump.\n\nThe closed-door testimony on Wednesday followed 10 hours of testimony on Tuesday by U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, an NSC Ukraine expert who raised the alarm after listening in on the July call between Trump and Zelenskiy over Trump\u2019s request for a Biden investigation.\n\nThe call is at the heart of the congressional inquiry into whether Trump misused the power of his office for personal political gain and, if so, whether that rises to the level of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d that merit impeachment and removal from office under the Constitution.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing.\n\nDuring the conversation, summarized in a memo released by the White House, Trump also sought an investigation into a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nVindman told lawmakers on Tuesday that the summary of the call released by the White House left out information he had sought to include, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe rough transcript left out an assertion by Trump that there were recordings of Biden discussing corruption in Ukraine and Zelenskiy\u2019s explicit mention of Burisma, the Times said, citing three people familiar with his testimony.\n\nMore witnesses are expected later this week, including Timothy Morrison, the National Security Council Senior Director for Europe and Russia, on Thursday and Robert Blair, a senior adviser to acting White House chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, on Friday.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nThe House is expected to vote this week on the formal process of moving forward with the impeachment inquiry after Republicans criticized the process as unfair to Trump.\n\nTrump has urged his allies to directly tackle the allegations against him.\n\n\u201cThis Impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt Hoax,\u201d he tweeted Wednesday morning, urging Republicans to \u201cgo with Substance and close it out!\u201d", "description": "A Republican former congressman turned lobbyist repeatedly pushed for the dismissal of U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, an action later taken by President Donald Trump after he was urged to do so by his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, a U.S. diplomat said in testimony on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Jonathan Landay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446538902&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T153", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
