But Hale will decide whether any disciplinary or other actions should be taken, Barnett said.\n\nDays after the incident, Hale said Brosch and Smith had used a \"trained technique\" in escorting Neely but exercised poor judgment in doing so and could have waited for vehicular transport to become available.\n\nBarnett said the chief also has suspended all mounted police patrols in Galveston, a Gulf Coast island resort city and port southeast of Houston. She said the city typically uses mounted police for ceremonial events and crowd control only but was trying out horseback patrols on busy summer weekends.\n\nCommunity activists and lawyers for Neely's family have demanded decisive action to prevent a repeat of police conduct they said was an insult to the dignity of all African-Americans.\n\n\"When they dragged Donald Neely down that road by horses and rope, it was like they were dragging our entire community down the road,\" Ben Crump, president of the National Civil Rights Trial Lawyers Association, said in an appearance with other supporters in August.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)", "description": "The spectacle was caught on body cameras worn by the two officers during their Aug. 3 trespassing arrest of Donald Neely, who family lawyers have said is known to city police as someone who suffers from mental illness and regularly sleeps on the streets.
