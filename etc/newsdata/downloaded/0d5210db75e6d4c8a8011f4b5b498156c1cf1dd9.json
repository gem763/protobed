Two ironworkers on the crane were killed, along with two people in cars. Four others were injured.\n\n\"This tragic event must not be repeated,\" Sacks said. \"We expect all companies to follow manufacturers' procedures and have a single point of authority overseeing crane assembly or disassembly. There has to be one person on site who knows the rules and is in charge.\"\n\nThe penalized firms, which were fined a collective $107,200, were among five reviewed after the accident.\n\nOregon-based Morrow Equipment Co., which supplied the crane, was fined $70,000. As the on-site expert, regulators said Morrow should have ensured the manufacturer's instructions were followed.\n\nTwo other firms were cited for violations including not having a supervisor present and inadequate training. General contractor GLY was fined $25,000, and Northwest Tower Crane Service Inc., which provided the crew, was fined $12,000.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe companies have 15 days to appeal. Morrow didn't respond to emails seeking comment from FOX Business, and Northwest Tower Crane Service declined to comment.\n\nIn an emailed statement, GLY President Ted Herb said the Bellevue-based company was deeply concerned by the collapse, cooperated with the state\u2019s investigators and had already made changes.\n\nHerb said the company will \u201cdo everything possible to protect our workers and the community.\u201d\n\nSeaburg Construction and Omega Rigging and Machinery were cleared, officials said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nBrian Haight, crane program manager with the state regulator, said that the manufacturer\u2019s instructions call for the crane to be dismantled in sections. As a secondary crane is attached to the top of the section being removed, workers pull the pins for that section only, leaving the rest of the tower secure. The pins are about 16 inches (40 cm) long and weigh 26 pounds (11.79 kilograms).\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "'If the companies on site had followed the rules, the crane would not have fallen,' a state regulator says.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Seattle-crane-collapse-AP-001.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
