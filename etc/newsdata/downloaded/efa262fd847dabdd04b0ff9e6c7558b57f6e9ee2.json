The comedian, who ran a fan website for Collette as a teenager and got the opportunity to give the actor a birthday collage he made for her as a kid last year, has another thing to be proud of today: Toni has confirmed that she is, like us, a big fan of John\u2019s impersonation of her. During his show last night, Seth Meyers played a clip for Collette from 2017, in which Early shows off his perfect take on Collette\u2019s iconic \u201cDo I make her proud?\u201d line from The Sixth Sense. \u201cHe\u2019s hilarious,\u201d Collette tells Meyers. \u201cNext time you can do an impression of him,\u201d Meyers suggests, to which Collette replies, \u201cVery gladly, actually.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the clip of Early when he was on Late Night again, just in case you want to watch the master at work for a second time:\n\nYou\u2019ve never seen an impression of Toni Collette in the Sixth Sense quite like @bejohnce\u2019s. pic.twitter.com/hI3P88TP2V \u2014 Late Night with Seth Meyers (@LateNightSeth) June 7, 2017", "description": "On NBC\u2019s \u2018Late Night,\u2019 Seth Meyers showed guest Toni Collette a clip of comedian John Early\u2019s impersonation of her.
