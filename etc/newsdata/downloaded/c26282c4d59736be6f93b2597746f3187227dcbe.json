An Indonesian journalist has been left permanently blinded in her right eye by a rubber bullet said to have been fired by police on Sunday. On Tuesday, an 18-year-old protester was wounded when a police officer fired a live bullet into his shoulder.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Footage of the shooting shows the police officer fire one bullet at close range\n\nFace masks are often worn by protesters to help prevent them from being identified and arrested by authorities.\n\nIn the recent Hong Kong protests, police have used water cannon to spray blue dye on demonstrators to make it easier to identify them later.\n\nWhy has the unrest turned violent?\n\nOpponents of the proposed extradition law thought it would put Hong Kongers at risk of unfair trials and, in July, Carrie Lam said the law \"was dead\".\n\nDespite this, protesters feared the bill could be revived, so demonstrations continued, calling for it to be withdrawn completely. The bill was finally withdrawn in September.\n\nBut clashes between police and protesters had already created their own momentum, and authorities continue to try to crack down on the unrest.\n\nThe 96 people, mostly students, who had been arrested on Sunday have already appeared in court charged with rioting. The injured 18-year-old protester has been charged with rioting and assaulting an officer.\n\nThe protests have been spared by wider discontent too. Recent years have seen growing opposition to the perceived encroachment of Beijing on Hong Kong's politics and threats to local identity.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nUntil 1997, Hong Kong was a British territory. Since then, it has been part of China - but with its own system of law and government, known as One Country, Two Systems.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence\n\nHong Kong has its own judiciary and a separate legal system. Rights including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech are protected.\n\nBut those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047. It is not clear what Hong Kong's status will be then.", "description": "Authorities plan to invoke emergency powers on Friday to impose the ban at public gatherings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1930/production/_109084460_gettyimages-1173037961.jpg"}
