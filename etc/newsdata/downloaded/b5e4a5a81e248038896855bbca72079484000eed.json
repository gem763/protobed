Fernandez will have very little time to deliver a coherent plan that the markets and the IMF can endorse,\" Bernal said.\n\nMacri was elected on promises of \"normalizing\" an economy distorted by Fernandez de Kirchner's heavy-handed trade and currency controls. But he overestimated his ability to attract investment and underestimated the inflationary impact of his fiscal policies.\n\nThese included cuts in public utility subsidies that boosted electricity and heating bills for businesses, which in turn hiked prices for the goods and services they sold. Inflation took off and has yet to moderate. Consumer prices rose 5.9% in September alone.\n\n(Reporting by Walter Bianchi and Hugh Bronstein; Additional reporting by Jorge Otaola and Hernan Nessi; Editing by Hugh Lawson, Marguerita Choy and Daniel Wallis)", "description": "Argentina's central bank kept selling dollars in defense of the crumbling peso on Friday, as concern increased over the bank's falling reserves ahead of Sunday's presidential election dreaded by the financial markets.
