Police had installed covert cameras at the victim's flat after money started going missing at the beginning of March.\n\nThe elderly victim was described in court as 'easily confused, forgetful and far too trusting', relying on carers going in three times a day to help her.\n\nRobinson, of Arthur's Hill, Newcastle, admitted two counts of burglary. She was given a two-year prison sentence, suspended for two years, with a 12-month night-time curfew and a mental health treatment requirement.\n\nIrene Robinson, 60, stole from the victim at accommodation in the West End of Newcastle\n\nSentencing her at Newcastle Crown Court, Judge Sarah Mallett said: 'The CCTV shows you stealing from her purse as she's stood right in front of you.\n\n'She was an extremely vulnerable victim and this is a despicable offence. You targeted her because of her vulnerability.'\n\nThe court heard the victim was living at Iris Steadman House, in Arthur's Hill, when the offences took place.\n\nIrene Robinson, pictured, stole from the frail victim\n\nHer carers noticed money disappearing. On March 18, \u00a370 was stolen from her purse. Then, seven days later, a further \u00a380 was stolen from the flat.\n\nA warden had noticed a woman going to the victim's flat - and challenged her.\n\nProsecutor Jessica Slaughter said Robinson, who knew the victim from bingo, claimed to be the pensioner's best friend and left - before returning to steal the cash.\n\nMiss Slaughter said: 'By this time, police had installed covert cameras inside her home.\n\n'They left four marked \u00a320 notes so the police could trace who was taking the money and the money was put inside her purse.'\n\nRobinson attended around 4.45pm and left shortly afterwards. When she was stopped ans searched, she was found to be in possession of the four notes the police had planted.\n\nMiss Slaughter said: 'The covert footage showed her taking money from the purse while stood right next to her in the living room.'\n\nThe elderly victim was described in court as 'easily confused, forgetful and far too trusting', relying on carers going in three times a day to help her\n\nSentencing her at Newcastle Crown Court, Judge Sarah Mallett said: 'The CCTV shows you stealing from her purse as she's stood right in front of you. She was an extremely vulnerable victim and this is a despicable offence. You targeted her because of her vulnerability'\n\nThe victim's carer said in a victim impact statement: 'She is a very vulnerable person who should not be exploited due to her age and disability and is entitled to care and help. No-one should be targeted in this way.'\n\nThe warden at the sheltered accommodation added: 'I can't believe someone would deliberately target such a vulnerable and lovely elderly lady.'\n\nPaul Cross, defending, said: 'The reality is the defendant is pretty vulnerable herself.\n\n'This was not a total stranger, she knew this lady from the bingo.\n\n'This is a lady of 60 years of age with no previous convictions and her own problems. She has a mild learning disability.'", "description": "Irene Robinson, 60, stole from the frail victim at sheltered accommodation in the West End of Newcastle.
