He added \u201cThe north has been denied its fair share of transport investment for too long.\u201d\n\nThe infrastructure project has been controversial since it was proposed by Labour in 2009 \u2013 facing opposition by both those concerned by its monumental cost and those who feared its impact on nature. Wildlife campaigners have warned that dozens of areas of \u201cirreplaceable\u201d ancient woodland will be destroyed by the scheme.\n\nThe project has also suffered significant delays and rising costs. In September, HS2 Ltd chairman Allan Cook admitted that the original plans \u201cdid not take sufficient account\u201d of the difficulty posed by building a high-speed line through densely populated areas with challenging ground conditions.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We are not going to pre-empt or prejudice this work with a running commentary on the review\u2019s progress.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by PA.", "description": "Campaigners have warned the government that any move to scrap high-speed rail network HS2\u2019s route towards Leeds will \u201cmake a mockery\u201d of its pledges to empower the north.
