So it\u2019s really not clear where he\u2019s going with this, but a lot of people are very rattled,\" Dilanian said. \"Those CIA analysts I mentioned had to hire their own lawyers because no one is even sure if this a criminal investigation or not. And if it is a criminal investigation, what is the allegation of wrongdoing? No one I talked to can answer that.\"\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot of unease at the CIA and disquiet about the notion of federal prosecutors going over and rooting in their files,\" he explained. \"Not because they think they did anything wrong, but because these are sources and methods \u2014 some of the most highly classified documents and secrets in our government. And they are kept to a small set of people for a reason. It\u2019s a need-to-know situation.\"\n\nDurham is reporting to Attorney General William Barr in the inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation.\n\nMSNBC host Joe Scarborough said the DOJ's inquiry is \"akin to Barr conducting an investigation about Neil Armstrong\u2019s walk on the Moon, that it wasn\u2019t on the Moon, instead it was on a back lot in Burbank.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/22/2019 16:45:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/154/078559e6-5728-4930-88d6-530dad73a77f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
