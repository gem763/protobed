By the second hour of the party I have turned it all over to the spirit: Whatever happens is no longer in my hands. Everyone who is coming has arrived. The wine is flowing, the music playing, the food being happily (or unhappily) devoured. Everywhere I look are people I know and cherish, people from all walks of my life gathered together under one roof, talking and laughing, connecting face-to-face. Whether the party is large or small, a dance party for my 50th birthday or a small dinner party in honor of friends, something important is happening, something that extends far beyond me and even beyond the people invited. Something bigger. Something necessary.", "description": "To throw a party is to make oneself vulnerable.
