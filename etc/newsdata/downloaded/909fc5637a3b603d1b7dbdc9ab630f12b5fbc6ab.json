Companies that boast a faster pace of growth, such as like the big U.S. tech names have been favored during the past decade of central bank largesse.\n\nAlso, 47% percent of investors surveyed saw oil prices fairly valued around $55 per barrel before the weekend attack on a Saudi Arabia crude oil facility with investors holding the biggest underweight on the resource sector in more than three years.\n\nThe overall outlook remains cautious. Some 38% of investors expect a recession over the next 12 months, the highest reading in a decade. That compares with 59% who see a recession as unlikely. The most crowded trade in the eyes of fund managers remains bullish bets on U.S. Treasuries.\n\nSome 38% of investors think the U.S-China trade war is the new normal, while 30% believe it will be resolved before the 2020 U.S. Presidential election.", "description": "Fund managers have not piled into so-called value stocks, which have been shunned during the decade-long technology-led boom, even as shares in beaten-down companies have rallied over the past week, a key investor survey showed on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
