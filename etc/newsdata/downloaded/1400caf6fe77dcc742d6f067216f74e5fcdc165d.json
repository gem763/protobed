Eddie Jones was behind the idea to combat the haka and his captain, Owen Farrell, stood at the apex of the formation grinning while it was being performed. After the match, Farrell said: \u201cWe wanted not to just stand there and let them come at us.\u201d Mako Vunipola added: \u201cWe knew it would rile them up\u201d.\n\nNew Zealand dismissed the significance of the incident with their scrum-half Aaron Smith also revealing Farrell was winking at him during the performance. England dominated the early exchanges with Manu Tuilagi opening the scoring with a try after 96 seconds.\n\nIt is believed England have been fined a four-figure sum but less than the \u00a32,500 France had to pay when they adopted a similar formation before the 2011 World Cup final. On that occasion, almost all of the squad advanced beyond the halfway line. World Rugby said on Tuesday \u201cthe matter had been dealt with\u201d.\n\nEngland\u2019s response has been well received \u2013 including by World Rugby, which posted an official video of the incident on YouTube, entitled \u201cEngland\u2019s incredible response to intense New Zealand haka\u201d.\n\nBut the governing body was under pressure to act, having introduced its \u201ccultural ritual protocol\u201d after France\u2019s response to the haka in 2007. The players ended up almost nose to nose, with France forming a tricolour with red, white and blue T-shirts.", "description": "England have been reprimanded and fined for their V-shaped formation when facing the haka before World Cup semi-final victory over New Zealand", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff09072dbbe8987b07bc3a5431944bdeaabf5909/115_0_4956_2974/master/4956.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fd1b759e86bc181bad20448ffbfa4989", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
