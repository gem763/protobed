I don\u2019t know what the future holds and the great part is for me, football at this point is all borrowed time.\u201d\n\n\"So if he's selling his home and his trainer is selling his home and he's voiding his contract, what does that tell you?\"@AdamSchefter weighed in on Tom Brady's future, and whether or not it will continue to be with the Patriots. pic.twitter.com/rZnCVWMHkY \u2014 ESPN (@espn) October 22, 2019\n\nThat aligns with what Brady told ESPN\u2019s Randy Moss, one of his former teammates, even as he tried to explain why he\u2019s still in the game at 42.\n\n\u201cI think for me, one, it is the love of the game,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI enjoy it. Football is my first love. I sit here and think, \u2018If I wasn\u2019t playing football, what would I be doing?\u2019 I can\u2019t find an answer to that. It\u2019s like why not keep doing what I am doing?\u201d\n\nAt some point, though, \u201cwhy not\u201d may be an insufficient reason to keep playing.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of people that have made sacrifices in their life to support me \u2014 my wife, my kids, my family. They are getting a little bit older, so it isn\u2019t going to last forever,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou know, it will come. It is getting closer. We\u2019re close to the end,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is not going to go on forever. I am enjoying it. For me, at this point, it is really about the relationships. The people who I play for, the people who I play with, that is what I am enjoying.\u201d\n\nBrady at 42 is in his 20th season with the 7-0 Patriots. Over the summer, he reworked his contract so that he can officially become a free agent after the season. With the Patriots stressing defense this season, he is seventh among NFL quarterbacks in passing with 1,992 yards (with 11 touchdowns and four interceptions) and his 65.9 percent completion rate is among his best.\n\nAD\n\nSchefter connected the dots Monday night. \u201cLet\u2019s boil this down to the basic facts once again,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s look at some simple things: Has he put his home for sale? Yes. Has his trainer [TB12\u2032s Alex Guerrero] put his home for sale? Yes. Has he set up his contract to void after this season to become a free agent? Yes. So, if he\u2019s selling his home and his trainer is selling his home and he\u2019s voiding his contract? What does that tell you? He\u2019s setting up to move on.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIf he\u2019s not under center for New England and not relaxing on a beach somewhere in 2020, where might he be? Pro Football Talk\u2019s Mike Florio was able to imagine him in a different uniform, envisioning him at 43 with perhaps the New Orleans Saints or back in his hometown with the San Francisco 49ers, the team he adored as a child.\n\n\u201cBeyond that,\u201d Florio writes, \u201cthere\u2019s no clear match. Other possibilities, in theory, include the Chargers for a year in the new LA stadium, the Titans, where Brady would work with close friend Mike Vrabel, the Raiders for their first year in Las Vegas, and the Broncos as John Elway\u2019s ultimate personnel Hail Mary pass.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nESPN\u2019s Trey Wingo and Mike Golic considered another team with a great defense and a need at quarterback: Chicago. Allowing that Brady and Belichick may be tiring of one another, they quickly dismissed the idea that he might land in the Windy City.\n\nAD\n\nAlthough Schefter reported that it \u201cseems clear he\u2019s thinking about leaving New England,\u201d the offseason remains months away.\n\n\u201cThere are many times people set up things in their lives to move on and they walk to the abyss and they look down and they say, \u2018Whoa. I\u2019m not jumping now,\u2019 \u201d Schefter allowed. \u201cSo he could change his mind.\u201d\n\nRead more on the NFL from The Post:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "If you\u2019re looking for reassurance that he won\u2019t leave New England after the season, he isn\u2019t offering it.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/40Ly-dZf8A6sFBaRBhSrEgDecYk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/24LXKCHUQEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
