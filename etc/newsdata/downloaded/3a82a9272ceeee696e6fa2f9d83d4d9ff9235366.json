FOREX-China stimulus boosts Aussie, kiwi; markets await U.S. jobs data\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\nBy Saikat Chatterjee\n\nLONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Risky currencies including the\n\nAustralian dollar surged on Friday after China's central bank\n\ncut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, with\n\nmarkets also expecting the European Central Bank to unveil more\n\nstimulus next week.\n\nThe People's Bank of China said it was cutting banks'\n\nreserve requirements for the third time this year, sending a\n\nripple of optimism through currency markets though analysts\n\nquestioned how much stimulus global central banks have left.\n\n\"This won't be a flood of stimulus,\" said Neil Mellor, a\n\nsenior FX strategist at BNY Mellon in London.\n\n\"China and many other countries are in the same boat with\n\nfiscal policy constrained by debt and central banks resorting to\n\njawboning and some targeted easing.\"\n\nThe Chinese currency in the offshore market CNH=D3\n\nextended gains and was trading up 0.4% against the greenback at\n\n7.1120 yuan.\n\nThe Australian dollar - its fortunes closely intertwined\n\nwith the Chinese economy - gained 0.3% to $0.6837 AUD=D3 and\n\nstrengthened 0.7% versus the Swiss franc AUDCHF= .\n\nAppetite for risky assets, already firm in early London\n\ntrading thanks to strong data out of the United States, received\n\na further boost after China unveiled its latest round of policy\n\neasing.\n\nDATA EYED\n\nThe dollar steadied against its rivals, and was heading for\n\nits biggest weekly drop in a month, as markets still expect the\n\nFederal Reserve would cut U.S. interest rates this month, even\n\nif the U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday is stronger than\n\nexpected.\n\nThe slipped 0.1% to 98.32 and was down\n\n0.54% so far this week, its biggest weekly drop since early\n\nAugust.\n\n\"The latest risk rally rests on a number of pillars like the\n\nrecent upbeat U.S. data, receding political risks in the UK and\n\nhopes for an abatement of the US-China trade tensions,\" said\n\nValentin Marinov, head of G-10 FX research and strategy at\n\nCredit Agricole (PA: ) in London.\n\nSurveys suggested the U.S. economy was in better shape than\n\ninvestors had feared. Services activity accelerated in August\n\nand private employers increased hiring more than expected.\n\nThe U.S. non-farm payrolls report due later on Friday was\n\nexpected to show 158,000 jobs were added and the unemployment\n\nrate remained unchanged at 3.7% in August.\n\n\"Investors are now hoping they can take this week's\n\npositivity over the finishing line, so fingers crossed the\n\nAugust U.S. payroll report ... doesn't throw a damp towel on the\n\nproceedings,\" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist\n\nat AxiTrader.\n\nDespite the positive data, bond markets expect the Fed to\n\ncut interest rates this month. A total of 55 basis points of\n\nrate cuts are expected this year.\n\nA combination of likely dovish central banks and decent\n\neconomic data also encouraged investors to buy the Canadian\n\ndollar CAD=D3 and the Swedish crown SEK=D3 against the U.S.\n\ndollar.\n\nThe European Central Bank is leaning towards a package that\n\nincludes a rate cut, a beefed-up pledge to keep rates low for\n\nlonger and compensation for banks over the side-effects of\n\nnegative rates, sources told Reuters last week.\n\nREER valuations https://tmsnrt.rs/2PZZYM2\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "FOREX-China stimulus boosts Aussie, kiwi; markets await U.S. jobs data", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEAB80M4_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
