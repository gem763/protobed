This could be a watershed moment on the path to generally useful quantum computers.\n\nThe research team developed the technique in order to build a quantum computing simulator. Binary computers \u2013 like the kind you\u2019re using to read this article on \u2013 only understand ones and zeros. They work like a light switch, they\u2019re either on or off. Quantum computers have a third option. They can be both on and off at the same time. This is because of a quantum property called superposition.\n\nSuperposition is like being able to flip a light switch halfway on to create a weird state that\u2019s neither dark nor light, or perhaps it\u2019s both dark and light.\n\nIBM Research created an analog superposition simulator by making titanium atoms exhibit magnetic properties analogous to quantum superposition. In essence they used a special device called a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) with a needle-like instrument to find the atoms and push and pull them around.\n\nAccording to IBM\u2018s blog:\n\nIn our experiments, we use a quantum property of a titanium atom called \u201cspin\u201d to represent one qubit. The spin property makes each titanium magnetic, so it behaves like a tiny compass needle. Like a magnet on a refrigerator, each titanium atom has a north and south magnetic pole. The two magnetic orientations define the \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d of a qubit. We placed the titanium atom on a specially chosen surface, an ultra-thin layer of magnesium oxide, to protect its magnetism and allow it to show off its quantum personality.\n\nApparently titanium atoms are brimming with personality. The researchers used microwave bursts to arrange, order, and direct the atoms. The bursts emanated from the tip of the STM and forced the atoms to spin one way or another, like orderly ballroom dancers. Through this technique, the researchers successfully simulated quantum entanglement in a 2-qubit quantum system.\n\nIBM\u2019s Nobel-prize winning Scanning Tunneling Microscope\n\nAside from being mind-breakingly cool \u2013 just making individual titanium atoms dance on the point of a needle, no big deal \u2013 this research has immense implications for the field of quantum computing. Despite a litany of recent breakthroughs, we\u2019ve been in a sort of \u201cpre-abacus\u201d age where physicists have been brute-forcing quantum interactions with lasers and experiments that jump through more hoops than an NBA season has.\n\nThis feels like an abacus moment. If this technique is all it\u2019s cracked up to be, we could be looking at an entirely new approach to researching quantum computing problems.\n\nWe haven\u2019t had the opportunity to read the entire research paper yet, so we\u2019re still sorting out the details. But, considering co-author Kai Yang\u2019s previous work embedding memories in single atoms was likely the precursor to this breakthrough, this is exciting research from IBM.\n\nRead next: Facebook is about to reveal its News tab", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FIBMSTM.jpg&signature=5faa77993de1ba88fd4a9f1e9205a757", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
