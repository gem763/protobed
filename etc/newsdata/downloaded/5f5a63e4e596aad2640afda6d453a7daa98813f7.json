These recommendations are usually risk/reward commodities meant to be used in large-field tournaments. Typically, blending these low-owned hidden gems with well-aligned staples contributes to a viable GPP strategy.\n\nKeep in mind that the following player write-ups were constructed earlier in the day, and sometimes injury/rest situations can alter the fantasy landscape. Monitoring our MLB News & Headlines Feed throughout the day will keep you in the loop while giving you the subsequent DFS consequences of each information piece.\n\nWe will be looking at the 14-game main slate beginning at 7:05 ET.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nZac Gallen - Arizona (at New York Mets)\n\nGallen struggled with command through his first few starts since moving to Arizona. It appears that he\u2019s back on track after allowing five earned runs, four walks, and 12 hits through 17 innings over his last three starts. That\u2019s pretty impressive considering the level of competition against Milwaukee, San Diego, and the LA Dodgers. Tonight\u2019s road start against the Mets is tricky, but Gallen could be a sneaky-good tournament lift considering his talent level and recent form.\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nRyan O\u2019Hearn - Kansas City (at Chicago White Sox)\n\nStory continues\n\nThings haven\u2019t exactly panned out for O\u2019Hearn, who was labeled a sleeper for season-long fantasy leagues prior to the season. Regardless, he could give your DFS lineup a boost tonight while displaying that exciting power upside against White Sox RHP Ivan Nova\u2019s .348 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Nova had a nice stretch from mid-July into August, but he\u2019s currently under regression\u2019s spell after allowing 10 earned runs and 19 hits through 8.1 innings over his past two starts.\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nStarlin Castro - Miami (vs. Milwaukee)\n\nSure, Miami is the worst hitting team in baseball, but we can still find some interesting tournament bats within their lineup. Take Starlin Castro for instance, as the Marlins\u2019 infielder has posted five multi-hit performances with five homers, 13 runs, and nine RBIs over his last 11 games. He\u2019ll look to keep that heater alive against Milwaukee RHP Chase Anderson\u2019s .358 wOBA split to right-handed bats.\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nJon Berti - Miami (vs. Milwaukee)\n\nTake the final sentence in the previous write-up and directly apply it to Berti. The Miami utility man has been a sneaky-good fantasy asset lately, collecting seven hits with one homer, nine runs, and two stolen bases (seven walks) over his last eight contests. As mentioned earlier, Milwaukee RHP Anderson is generous to righties, and the Brewers\u2019 hurler has coughed-up 17 earned runs across 15.1 innings over his past four starts \u2026 If you\u2019re not interested in the Marlins tonight, Kyle Seager is another third baseman with upside against the recent generosity of Cincinnati RHP Trevor Bauer.\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nTrea Turner - Washington (at Minnesota)\n\nWe usually stay away from hitters facing Minnesota ace Jose Berrios, but the right-hander is having a tough time at the moment. Berrios has allowed 29 earned runs over his last six starts while noticing a drop in velocity as well. There are plenty of elite shortstops on this slate (Francisco Lindor, Alex Bregman, Trevor Story, even Paul DeJong), but don\u2019t forget about Trea Turner as a vessel to exploit Berrios\u2019 current vulnerabilities.\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nKevin Pillar - San Francisco (vs. Pittsburgh)\n\nMost people will avoid this game featuring a pair of lackluster offenses playing in a pitcher-friendly ballpark. However, I have my eye on San Francisco in large-field tournaments, as they\u2019ll look to jump on Pittsburgh RHP Mitch Keller - who carries an 8.18 ERA through 33 major league innings. Keller has struggled with hitters from both sides of the plate, and Kevin Pillar stands out as someone with realistic upside. Brandon Belt and Mike Yastrzemski are another pair of Giants on my GPP list.\n\nKyle Tucker - Houston (vs. Oakland)\n\nHouston has one of the best offenses in baseball, which creates excellent lineup security (and numerous RBI opportunities) for a sneaky fantasy option like Tucker. The ownership rate should be tiny due to a lack of name recognition with the Houston outfielder hitting down in the order. However, Tucker has looked confident at the plate with five hits, two doubles, one homer, and five RBIs over his last three starts. The matchup looks reasonably attractive against Oakland RHP Tanner Roark\u2019s .347 wOBA split to left-handed bats.", "description": "Spencer Limbach uncovers some sneaky-good MLB GPP Pivots away from the popular picks for Tuesday, September 10.
