Instead, he repeated his baseless allegation of voter fraud in Democratic-dominated California.\n\n\"A lot of illegal voting going on out there, by the way, a lot of illegal voting,\" Trump said during his 85-minute speech in Fayetteville. As we've pointed out before , there is zero evidence for this claim.\n\nTrump made at least 21 other false claims at the rally, most of them statements that have been debunked on multiple previous occasions.\n\nAs we continue to pore over the text, here's the preliminary list:\n\nChina and trade\n\nChina's economy\n\n\"I want China to do well and I hope they do well, but they've had now the worst year in 57 years,\" Trump said.\n\nTrade deficit with China\n\n\"China made $500 billion over the last number of years,\" Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump refers to trade deficits as economic losses, and surpluses as gains, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was Trump refers to trade deficits as economic losses, and surpluses as gains, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was $381 billion last year when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.\n\nWho is paying the tariffs on China\n\n\"Hundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs. And China is eating the cost, which the fake news doesn't want to tell you,\" Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Economic studies have found that Americans shoulder most of the cost of tariffs.\n\nIn addition, \"hundreds of billions\" is an exaggeration, at least when it comes to what has been collected thus far. US Customs and Border Protection reports collecting $41.6 billion from all kinds of duties in the 2018 fiscal year and $34.6 billion in the 2017 fiscal year, and it says $25 billion has been produced by Trump's tariffs on China in particular.\n\nThe USMCA and Canada\n\n\"We need a vote on the USMCA. That's United States, Mexico and Canada. And they've already voted. They want it,\" Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Mexico's Senate has voted to ratify the USMCA trade agreement, but Canada's Parliament has not held a vote.\n\nThe agreement is highly unlikely to be rejected by Parliament even if Justin Trudeau's Liberal government is ousted in the coming election, since the Conservative opposition party says it will \"reluctantly\" vote in favor. Still, the voting has not happened yet.\n\nThe USMCA and unions\n\nTrump, urging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to hold a vote on the USMCA, said, \"The unions want it.\"\n\nFacts First: American unions generally don't like Trump's North American trade agreement, a revised version of NAFTA. The AFL-CIO, a large labor federation made up of 55 unions, says changes must be made to the agreement before the federation could possibly be supportive; in a Fox News appearance in early September, AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka American unions generally don't like Trump's North American trade agreement, a revised version of NAFTA. The AFL-CIO, a large labor federation made up of 55 unions, says changes must be made to the agreement before the federation could possibly be supportive; in a Fox News appearance in early September, AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka called its present incarnation \"an unenforceable trade deal\" that would be \"a windfall for corporations and a disaster for workers.\"\n\nAs The New York Times has reported, the United Automobile Workers and United Steelworkers, among other unions, have also demanded changes.\n\nImmigration\n\nDemocrat Dan McCready\n\nTrump said that the Democratic candidate in the 9th District race, Dan McCready, \"wants open borders.\"\n\nFacts First: McCready does not support open borders. His website says he wants comprehensive immigration reform \"that secures our border, respects our laws and protects our American values.\" He calls for the government to \"reinforce physical barriers with the technology Dan used in the Marines, like infrared cameras and drones.\"\n\nDemocrats and borders\n\nTrump said the Democrats refuse to work with him to fix immigration laws \"because they want to have open borders.\"\n\nFacts First: Some Democrats, including presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Juli\u00e1n Castro, have advocated a significant loosening of immigration law, including a decriminalization of the act of illegally crossing the border. But none of them have proposed literally opening the border to unrestricted migration.\n\nDuring the Trump era, Democrats have voted for billions of dollars' worth of fencing and other border security measures.\n\nMigrants and court\n\n\"You have a program, catch and release: you catch them and then you have to release them. And they're supposed to come back to court in the next three, four, five, six years, and nobody shows up,\" Trump said.\n\nFacts First: While it is unclear what subset of migrants Trump was referring to, the While it is unclear what subset of migrants Trump was referring to, the majority of migrants do show up for court. In 2017, 89% of asylum seekers appeared in court to receive decisions on their cases. Among all kinds of migrants, 72% appeared in court.\n\nImmigration laws\n\n\"What can be much more threatening than people that want to pour across our borders? And we have the worst laws -- we have the weakest laws in the history of any country. You can't do anything to stop 'em,\" Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is obviously inaccurate hyperbole. Current US immigration laws are not even close to the weakest they have been in the history of this country: the US government did not This is obviously inaccurate hyperbole. Current US immigration laws are not even close to the weakest they have been in the history of this country: the US government did not make a broad effort to control the flow of people entering the country until the late 1800s , more than a century after the country's founding\n\nThere are clearly numerous tools at the government's disposal to stop people from illegally entering the country, from physical barriers to Border Patrol apprehensions. Trump frequently complains that asylum seekers must be released and granted a legal process, but that is also the case in other countries.\n\nThe border wall\n\nTrump said \"we're putting up miles and miles\" of the border wall.\n\nFacts First: No new miles of wall had been built during Trump's presidency as of August, Customs and Border Protection told CNN's Geneva Sands. Sixty miles of existing barriers have been replaced.\n\nOverdose deaths and the border\n\nTrump, talking about the opioid crisis and drug smuggling, said, \"100,000 people a year die from what comes across our southern border.\"\n\nFacts First: The \"100,000\" figure is an exaggeration, though we don't have an exact figure for overdose deaths connected to the southern border. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a The \"100,000\" figure is an exaggeration, though we don't have an exact figure for overdose deaths connected to the southern border. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a preliminary estimate that there were 68,557 drug overdose deaths of any kind in 2018, an estimated 47,590 of them involving any kind of opioid and an estimated 31,897 involving synthetic opioids including fentanyl.\n\nIt is obviously not true that all of these drugs came from Mexico; Trump himself has repeatedly said that a significant portion of trafficked fentanyl comes through the mail from China.\n\nEconomy\n\nAsian unemployment\n\nTrump said Asian Americans are at the best unemployment numbers \"we've ever had.\"\n\nFacts First: The unemployment rate for Asian Americans The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was 2.8% in August -- higher than the 2.6% rate in December 2016, Barack Obama's last full month in office.\n\nWomen's unemployment\n\nTrump said, \"The unemployment numbers for women are the best they've been now in 72 years.\"\n\nFacts First: This was another exaggeration. It has been 66 years since the women's rate has been as low as it has been this year -- it was 3.6% in August, 3.4% in April -- not 75 years.\n\nWe might omit this if it were a one-time slip, but Trump habitually exaggerates many positive statistics, including women's unemployment rates, even though the accurate figure is still impressive. In fact, according to our previous fact checking work at the Toronto Star , Trump exaggerated on women's unemployment in this kind of manner 37 times between the inauguration and June 2 of this year.\n\nManufacturing jobs\n\n\"And by the way: 600,000 manufacturing jobs in this country. Remember? 'You would need a magic wand, you can't do that anymore.' Well, we did it,\" Trump said.\n\nFacts First: The economy has added 485,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2017, when Trump took office, The economy has added 485,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2017, when Trump took office, official data shows . The number is 512,000 jobs added if you go back to November 2016, the month of Trump's election.\n\nTrump's \"magic wand\" comment was a reference to a remark Barack Obama made at a PBS town hall in 2016. Obama scoffed at Trump's promises to bring back what Obama called \"jobs of the past\" without providing specifics on how he would do so.\n\nContrary to Trump's frequent claims, though, Obama didn't say manufacturing jobs could not be created at all or created in large numbers; Obama boasted of how many were being created during his presidency, saying, \"We actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we've had in most of our history.\"\n\nAccomplishments\n\nRight to Try\n\n\"They've been trying to get this for 45 years,\" Trump said of the program that seeks to make it easier for terminally ill patients to access experimental medications.\n\nFacts First: There had not been a 45-year push for a federal Right to Try law, experts said. Similar laws have been passed at the state level only since 2014, after the Goldwater Institute, a libertarian think tank, began pushing for them.\n\nVeterans Choice\n\nTrump took credit for passing the Veterans Choice program that allows some veterans to be reimbursed for seeing doctors outside the VA system: \"We passed something that they've wanted to do for half a century. We passed VA Choice.\"\n\nFacts First: The Choice program, a bipartisan initiative The Choice program, a bipartisan initiative led by Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Cover the dishonesty,' Daniel Dale says Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'Cover the dishonesty,' Daniel Dale says 02:36\n\nEnergy production\n\n\"We ended the last administration's cruel war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world,\" Trump said.\n\nFacts First: The US has not just \"now\" become the world's top energy producer: it took the The US has not just \"now\" become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012 , under Obama, the very president he accused of perpetrating the \"war.\"\n\n\"The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's,\" the Energy Information Administration says\n\nPre-existing conditions\n\n\"We'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always,\" Trump said.\n\nFacts First: We usually don't fact-check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have We usually don't fact-check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.\n\nThe decline in overdose deaths\n\n\"Last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths in nearly 31 years,\" Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This was another of Trump's This was another of Trump's regular exaggerations of numbers that are already impressive. There was a rare decline in overdose deaths in 2018, according to preliminary data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics -- but it was the first in since 1990, or 28 years ago, not \"nearly 31 years\" ago.\n\nForeign affairs\n\nPayments to Iran\n\nTrump claimed that the US \"paid\" Iran \"$150 billion\" as part of the 2015 nuclear agreement.\n\nFacts First: The money in question was Iranian money frozen in foreign financial institutions because of sanctions, not US government money -- and experts say the total was significantly lower than $150 billion. You can read a The money in question was Iranian money frozen in foreign financial institutions because of sanctions, not US government money -- and experts say the total was significantly lower than $150 billion. You can read a fuller fact check here\n\nNATO spending\n\nTrump said that, \"until President Trump,\" military spending by non-US NATO members was declining. \"The NATO cost of -- spending was going like this,\" he said, moving his hand in a downward sloping motion.\n\nFacts First: Military spending by NATO members had increased for two years prior to Trump's presidency. According to Military spending by NATO members had increased for two years prior to Trump's presidency. According to official NATO figures , spending increased by 1.8% in 2015 and 2.8% in 2016, before Trump took office.\n\nTrump-era increases have been bigger -- 6% in 2017 and an estimated 3.8% in 2018 -- and Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has credited Trump for his role in prompting the increase. But the upward trend started two years before Trump's tenure began.\n\nIn 2014, NATO countries who were not yet meeting the alliance guideline of spending 2% of their Gross Domestic Product on defense re-committed to meeting the target. Spending began rising after that.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "description": "President Donald Trump held a campaign rally on Monday in a North Carolina congressional district that is having a special election on Tuesday because of credible allegations of Republican election fraud.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale", "Holmes Lybrand", "Tara Subramaniam"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190909201742-02-trump-nc-rally-0909-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
