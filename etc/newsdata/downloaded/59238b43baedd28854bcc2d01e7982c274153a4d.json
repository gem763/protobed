They tend to be in a glass cabinet that's locked up and a member of staff has to go and unlock that cabinet every single time you want to buy fireworks.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nShe also said the customer's age has to be checked because it is illegal to sell fireworks to anyone under 16. In addition, the supermarket cannot send back any unsold products to the distributor, \"and they are quite dangerous to keep in the back of shops, which are busy places\".\n\nA petition last year calling for a ban, which gained 307,897 signatures, said that fireworks \"injure thousands of people every year\" and \"cause damage to buildings, vehicles, [and] emergency vehicles\".\n\nIn response, the government said it \"takes the issue of safety of fireworks very seriously. Legislation is in place to control their sale, use and misuse. We have no plans to change legislation\".\n\nOne healthcare professional said on Twitter: \"Just came here to say a huge thank you and praise to Sainsbury's for the decision to not sell fireworks this year. It is not just the animals who suffer but anyone who is unwell or has a condition like autism.\"\n\nScottish National Party MP Alison Thewliss tweeted: \"Really pleased to see Sainsbury's have taken the responsible decision to stop selling fireworks. I hope other retailers follow suit.\"\n\nA recent consultation in Scotland over the sale of fireworks to the public found that there was support for tougher controls on the selling and use of the products.\n\nOf the 16,000 people who responded, 94% wanted tighter controls on the sale of fireworks and 87% supported an outright ban on the sale of fireworks.", "description": "The supermarket is the first to end sales amid calls for a ban to protect pets and the vulnerable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/EC5C/production/_109280506_doggy1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
