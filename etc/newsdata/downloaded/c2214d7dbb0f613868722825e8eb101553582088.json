The former first lady, senator, secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate is ready for another round in the public arena. She has a new book arriving, written with the help of a very close relative. Behold. Here comes \u201cThe Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience\u201d \u2014 all 464 pages of it.\n\nIndeed, the new book of essays now landing on the shelves is written by Mrs. Clinton and her daughter Chelsea Clinton, is published by Simon & Schuster. Some informed observers speculate the book could be yet another indicator \u2014 along with increased public appearances and commentary \u2014 that Mrs. Clinton pines for a political comeback.\n\nWhat kind of comeback? Oh, maybe the bumper stickers will read BIDEN/CLINTON 2020, WARREN/CLINTON 2020 \u2014 or even CLINTON/CLINTON 2020. Who the heck knows?\n\n\u201cWord on the political street now is the rumbling that the impeachment probe launched by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi may be the crack that opens the door for another presidential run by Hillary Clinton. This time, the thinking goes, Hillary would be running with vindication that the 2016 election was \u2018stolen\u2019 from her and she can ascend in 2020 to reclaim the mantle for her party and the majority of the country that voted for her,\u201d writes Nate Ashworth, editor in chief of Election Central.\n\n\u201cClinton\u2019s sallies against Trump raise a key question: is she gunning for a rematch in 2020?\u201d asks The National Interest.\n\nIndeed. Mrs. Clinton certainly sounds like a candidate, backing the impeachment inquiry against President Trump with gusto.\n\n\u201cThere should be an impeachment inquiry opened. And I think, sadly, there are a number of grounds. But this one is incredibly troubling. The most outrageously false things were said about me. And unfortunately, enough people believed them,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told CBS on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThis is an effort to sow these falsehoods against Joe Biden. And I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re for the Democrats or you\u2019re a Republican, when the president of the United States, who has taken an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, uses his position to in effect extort a foreign government for his political purposes, I think that is very much what the founders worried about in high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d she declared.\n\n\u201cThe president is a corrupt human tornado,\u201d Mr. Clinton noted in a follow-up tweet.\n\nBut back to the new book for a moment, which will likely rocket toward No. 1 in the next 24 hours.\n\n\u201cIf history shows one thing, it\u2019s that the world needs gutsy women,\u201d says co-author Chelsea, who is vice chair of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.\n\nAL FRANKEN RETURNS TO THE AIRWAVES\n\nFormer Sen. Al Franken has quietly returned to the airwaves with a one-hour live radio show that premiered Saturday on SiriusXM Progress channel 127. \u201cThe Al Franken Show\u201d is now a reality.\n\n\u201cListeners can expect a mix of guests from my comedian friends like Chris Rock, to my political pals like former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, to policy experts on the issues in play in 2020. When I\u2019m interviewing Harry or former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, I\u2019ll be the funny one. When I interview Rock or Patton Oswalt, I\u2019ll be the one who served eight-and-a-half years in the Senate,\u201d Mr. Franken says.\n\nOf note: he will join the SiriusXM Progress team for special coverage of the 2020 elections, including presidential debates, primaries, and election night.\n\nTOM STEYER TURNS TO FOX NEWS\n\nCould the fact that Fox News is the most-watched cable network of all have something to do with it? Well, yes. But there\u2019s much more at work here. Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer has launched Talk to Trump, a new ad campaign that asks voters to submit 25-second videos of themselves talking directly to President Trump. The organizers envision that voters will discuss their concerns and his failures.\n\n\u201cSome of the videos will air as television ads in the coming weeks on \u2018Fox & Friends,\u2019 a place Trump is likely to see them. The ad campaign gives the American public a chance to raise their voices and tell Donald Trump exactly what matters most to them, and how much he has failed them as president,\u201d Mr. Steyer\u2019s campaign advises.\n\nInteresting. But Mr. Trump\u2019s fans may want to submit a video or two as well. The videos can be uploaded directly at the candidate\u2019s website, or emailed to [email protected]\n\nMEANWHILE ON CAMPUS\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of Republican college students compared to a small number of Democratic college students say they are very proud to be an American,\u201d says a new College Fix survey of 1,000 college students released Monday.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority (74%) of Republican college students, compared to a small number of Democratic college students (8%), and less than one-third of independents (30%), said they are very proud to be an American,\u201d the publication reports.\n\n\u201cOn the flip side, 2% of Republican college students, compared to 22% of Democratic college students, and 11% of independents, say they are not at all proud to be an American,\u201d the poll said.\n\n\u201cHell yeah I\u2019m proud. I hit the jackpot being born in America,\u201d commented one student from the University of California at Riverside.\n\n\u201cMost corrupt government in the history of the world,\u201d countered another from Colorado University at Boulder.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 50% of Americans say the Republican Party does the best job of protecting the country from international terrorism and military threats; 44% say the Democratic Party does the best job.\n\n\u2022 49% say the Republican Party does the best job keeping the country prosperous; 45% overall say the Democratic Party does the best job.\n\n\u2022 43% overall give the Republican Party a favorable review; 48% give the Democratic Party a favorable review.\n\nSource: A Gallup poll of 1,525 U.S. adults conducted Sept. 3-15 and released Monday.\n\n\u2022 Kindly follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
