Khlo\u00e9 replied:\n\n\n\nI know everybody makes mistakes, I think it's how you handle it and I think apologies need to be as loud as your disrespect was or to me it's not sincere. I'm forgiving. I'm forgiven. I'm not someone who holds a grudge. If I do that it's only going to affect me...that chapter is closed for me. I want all of us to move on and to be happy, successful people. I just want everyone to just be better people with each day. That's genuinely how I feel. You know, that's really it.\n\nAnd not only has Khlo\u00e9 moved on, but she's also found the positives in the situation. She told Ryan, \"Things have to happen to me for me to become a better person as well, and if we can\u2019t laugh at it, what in the hell am I going to do? Sit in a ball and cry?...You have to laugh and still move on with life and know that everything is going to be okay.\"\n\nSo basically Khlo\u00e9 is thriving, thanks for asking!!\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\"That chapter is closed for me.\"", "authors": ["Alanna Lauren Greco"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lzCMb7R9Ku9_jJQ9D1NsRA--~B/aD02MjI7dz0xMjQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/de0ca88010ea62461887865bd23fdbb0", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
