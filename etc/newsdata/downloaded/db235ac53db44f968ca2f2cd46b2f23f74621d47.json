Security forces firing tear gas had earlier failed to clear the square of demonstrators.\n\nIn Nasiriya, CTS soldiers broke up demonstrations by beating and arresting dozens, police and security sources said.\n\nThe two cities, where thousands had turned out for a second day of protests, saw the bulk of Saturday\u2019s violence as protesters continued to vent their frustration at political elites they say have failed to improve their lives after years of conflict and economic hardship.\n\nFour people were killed after being struck directly in the head by tear gas canisters fired by security forces in Baghdad, with dozens more wounded. Four others died in Nasiriya, when a group of protesters stormed the home of a local security official, police said. Guards opened fire after the protesters torched the building, police said.\n\nSeven more people died in Hilla, most when members of the Iranian-backed Badr Organization militia group opened fire on protesters who had gathered near their office.\n\nAt least 52 people were killed around the country on Friday, and more than 2,000 more wounded.\n\nThe latest bloodshed was the second major bout of violence this month. Earlier in October, 157 people were killed and more than 6,000 wounded in other clashes between protesters and security forces.\n\nSPIRALLING VIOLENCE\n\nThe unrest has broken nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq, which from 2003 to 2017 endured a foreign occupation, civil war and an Islamic State (IS) insurgency.\n\nIt poses the biggest challenge to Abdul Mahdi since he took office just a year ago. Despite promising reforms and ordering a broad cabinet reshuffle, he has so far struggled to address the protesters\u2019 discontent.\n\nAdding more pressure, the parliamentary bloc linked to Shi\u2019ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr announced it was going into opposition on Saturday, a big blow to his premiership.\n\nA demonstrator holds a religious flag during a protest over corruption, lack of jobs, and poor services, in Baghdad, Iraq October 26, 2019.

Although volleys of tear gas were lobbed indiscriminately at protesters on Saturday, many demonstrators expressed relief that security forces had not used live rounds this time.\n\nIn Baghdad protesters distributed masks and homemade remedies to protect themselves from the tear gas. Others handed out food and water.\n\nAs sirens wailed and tuk-tuks ferried bloodied protesters to hospitals, others expressed outrage at a political establishment so willing to resort to violence.\n\n\u201cOur protests are peaceful, we only have flags and water bottles, but they keep firing bombs at us, firing tear gas at us,\u201d said 33-year-old demonstrator Silwan Ali. \u201cWhat have we done to deserve this? What have we done? The young men who died, what did they do?\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018STEALING FROM US\u2019\n\nMost of those killed on Friday and Saturday were protesters in cities in the south, as demonstrators focused their anger on politicians and Iranian-backed Shi\u2019ite militia groups.\n\nMembers of the powerful Asaib Ahl al-Haq (AAH) militia turned their guns on protesters in both Nasiriya and Amara on Friday, leaving scores dead. AAH also clashed with another powerful militia, one loyal to populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.\n\nDespite a curfew and federal anti-riot forces dispatched from Baghdad, thousands gathered across cities in the south on Saturday, clashing again with militia groups.\n\nProtesters continued to torch the offices of all major political parties, militia groups, and local government buildings. In Nasiriya, they set fire to the governor\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cThis is not a protest, this is a revolution,\u201d said one protester who declined to give his name.\n\nSlideshow (30 Images)\n\nParliament was set to meet on Saturday in an emergency session to discuss the protesters\u2019 demands, but with many politicians keeping a low profile since the protests began it failed to reach a quorum and the session was canceled.\n\n\u201cThe government has been stealing from us for 15 years. Saddam went and 1,000 Saddams have been hiding in the Green Zone,\u201d a protester who declined to be named said on Saturday, referring to the former Iraqi dictator.", "description": "At least 67 Iraqis were killed and hundreds wounded in two days of protests over the weekend, as demonstrators clashed with security forces and militia groups in a second wave of protests against Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi's government this month.", "authors": ["Ahmed Aboulenein", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445272447&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P0LH", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
