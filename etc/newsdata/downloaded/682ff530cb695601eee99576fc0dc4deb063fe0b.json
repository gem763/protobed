Experts Aren't So Sure", "language": "en", "text": "Colt will stop producing AR-15 rifles for consumers, the Connecticut-based gunmaker announced Thursday.\n\nIn a statement, Colt\u2019s CEO Dennis Veilleux said the decision to suspend production was entirely market-driven. The statement made no mention of the mass shootings that involved the style of semi-automatic weapon, which include the Sandy Hook and Parkland tragedies. And though neither of the firearms in those two shootings were manufactured by Colt, the gunmaker did own the patent for the design of the widely popular AR-15 until it expired in the 1970s, when other companies could begin making and selling similar types of weapon.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that over the last few years, the market for modern sporting rifles has experienced significant excess manufacturing capacity,\u201d he said, while also emphasizing that the company \u201cis committed to the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe gunmaker also cited a need to focus its manufacturing capabilities on outstanding contracts with military and law enforcement groups.\n\n\u201cCurrently, these high-volume contracts are absorbing all of Colt\u2019s manufacturing capacity for rifles,\u201d Veilleux wrote.\n\nDespite their statement, experts wonder whether the company made the decision with other factors in mind.\n\n\u201cThe public is getting very alarmed about what\u2019s happening with assault rifles in the hands of potential mass shooters,\u201d John Donohue, a Stanford Law professor with expertise in gun policy, tells TIME. \u201cColt may just be feeling better to get out of that particular market, and they\u2019re offering this purely economic manufacturing argument rather than addressing the political realities right now as the justification for this decision.\u201d\n\nAR-15-style rifles were used in the mass shootings that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012, an Aurora, Colo., movie theater in 2012, the Vegas Harvest music festival in 2017 and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018. The Las Vegas gunman had several Colt rifles among the 24 guns found in his hotel rooms. The guns used in the other shootings were made by other manufacturers.\n\nTimothy Lytton, author of Suing the Gun Industry and a law professor at Georgia State University, has a similar view to Donohue.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be associated with a gun that\u2019s becoming increasingly viewed as a shabby crime gun, when their brand is supposed to be bigger,\u201d he says. \u201cThe danger for them in this\u2014and this is something that they\u2019re well aware of in their messaging, is that when gun companies tend to respond to this sort of pressure, there\u2019s a huge backlash from the gun rights community.\u201d\n\nFollowing pressure from gun control advocates, some retailers have risked losing gun rights proponents as customers while they take steps to enhance their safety policies. National chains including Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Publix and Kroger all asked customers to stop openly carrying firearms inside their stores after gunmen killed more than 30 people at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart and in a Dayton, Ohio, entertainment district less than 24 hours apart last month. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods also announced it would remove firearms from 125 of its retail locations. (The company had already banned the sale of assault-style weapons after the Parkland shooting.)\n\nPublic opinion shows widespread support for stronger gun safety measures too: 81% of Americans now favor requiring background checks for gun buyers in order to curtail mass shootings, and nearly 60% of respondents said they favored banning \u201cassault weapons,\u201d according to a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll.\n\nBut those percentages are likely much, much lower among Colt\u2019s customer base. And the last time Colt tried to make the industry a little safer by designing a firearm that could only be unlocked and fired by a user wearing a radio-frequency wristband, the plan backfired. Consumers began to worry whether the innovation would affect what kind of firearms they could purchase in the future. \u201cThere was a lot of pressure in the gun rights community against these sorts of weapons,\u201d Lytton said.\n\nNow Colt, like other gun makers, has to balance pressures from both gun control advocates and its customers. Though the gunmaker says it has been \u201ca stout supporter of the Second Amendment for over 180 years, remains so, and will continue to provide its customers with the finest quality firearms in the world,\u201d its full reasoning for ending the production of AR-15 rifles for civilians might be a tad more complicated than that.\n\n\u201cThis is a sort of delicate dance,\u201d says Lytton, \u201cto sort of walk that thin line between pressure on both sides of this debate.\u201d", "description": "Experts wonder if the company was swayed by mass shootings involving the weapon", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7dE5WAx6wuhZ55C8ASxE8A--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTU2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/cbe971afdebec11620b17281e175909f", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
