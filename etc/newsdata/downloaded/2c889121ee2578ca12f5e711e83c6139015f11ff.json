We are going to Philly.\"\n\nThat was the message Southwest pilot Tammie Jo Shults sent from the cockpit as Southwest flight 1380 lost altitude in 4,000-foot chunks, having suffered catastrophic damage and an engine loss. The airplane, which had departed from New York's Laguardia airport and was bound for Dallas, would never complete the journey.\n\nShults became an instant hero when she landed the flight in Philadelphia on April 17, 2018, with 149 souls aboard, averting disaster through quick thinking and careful maneuver. Only one passenger was lost: Jennifer Riordan, who was tragically sucked partially out of a broken airplane window.\n\nOnce on the ground, a paramedic marveled at Shults' controlled heart rate, telling her she had \"nerves of steel.\"\n\nAs Shults recalled in her new memoir with the same title, she'd had ample practice in her career as an airline pilot \u2014 and prior to that, as a naval aviator flying fighter jets \u2014 in mastering her emotions and responses to get the job done.\n\nOne of the first women to fly the Navy's F/A-18 Hornet in the 1980s, Shults recounts meeting opposition at every turn from male pilots and senior officers who were convinced that she didn't belong. The stories are troubling, from the Navy operations officer who tried to end her career over the fit of her harness to the senior pilot at Southwest who drenched her paperwork in hot coffee after every flight.\n\nBut Shults insists on emphasizing the positive. The undesirable instructor duty she was given out of spite for a year in the Navy, she writes, made her confident and ready for anything; the open harassment and disdain from male peers gave her flinty resolve.\n\n\"I strive to focus on the heroes and not be distracted by the villains,\" she writes in \"Nerves of Steel.\"\n\nShults, 57, spoke with Military.com this week about her book and her experiences.
