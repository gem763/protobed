Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday announced her first endorsement of a 2020 congressional primary challenger over a Democratic incumbent, throwing her high-profile support behind Marie Newman\u2019s bid to unseat Rep.

The eight-term House member is one of the few Democrats with a record of opposing abortion rights and discrimination protections for LGBTQ people.\n\n\u201cMarie Newman is a textbook example of one of the ways that we could be better as a party \u2014 to come from a deep blue seat and to be championing all the issues we need to be championing,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told The New York Times.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Marie Newman, a former advertising executive, ran against Rep. Dan Lipinski in 2018 but lost by about 2,000 votes.\n\nNewman, a former advertising executive turned nonprofit founder, has also nabbed key endorsements from two presidential candidates: Sens.
