Khan has so far focused on a global diplomatic campaign condemning India's actions. these testing times... mere diplomatic and political support is not going to work,\" Salahuddin told a gathering of hundreds in Muzaffarabad, the capital of the Pakistani zone of Kashmir.\n\nOn stripping Indian-controlled Kashmir of its special status, New Delhi blocked the region's right to frame its own laws and allowed non-residents to buy property there. The government said the reform would facilitate Kashmir's development, to the benefit of all.\n\nBut the move angered many residents of the region, which has been under a security clampdown ever since with telephone lines, internet and television networks blocked and restrictions on movement and assembly.\n\nIndia and Pakistan both rule parts of Kashmir while claiming it in full.\n\nIslamabad this year announced it was cracking down on militant groups amidst global pressure to do so after a group launched a deadly attack on paramilitary police in India-controlled Kashmir in February. said that \"harsh steps\" taken by the government of Pakistan had hindered his group's ability to take action.\n\n\"These steps have restrained us from launching armed resistance against India in a move that is unfair,\" he said.\n\nOfficials in Pakistan say the government is working to show it is behaving responsibly and have rejected suggestions there could be a temptation to use militants as proxies against India.\n\nSalahuddin, who is originally from Badgam town in Indian-administered Kashmir, was placed on a list of global terrorists by Washington in 2017, a move Pakistan's government at the time called unjustified.", "description": "Kashmiri militant calls for Pakistan military intervention in disputed region", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/news_headline_open_108x81._800x533_L_1419519630.jpg"}
