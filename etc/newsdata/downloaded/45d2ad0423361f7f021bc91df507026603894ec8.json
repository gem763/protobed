That's down about 65% percent from the peak in May of about 144,000.\n\nMorgan says the administration's strategies have brought about results.\n\nThose policies have included denying asylum to most migrants who crossed through another country to arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border and sending more than 45,000 migrants back to Mexico to wait out their asylum claims.\n\nIt was the fourth straight month of declines.\n\nMost immigrants coming to the U.S. are Central American families who turn themselves in after fleeing violence and poverty.\n\nActing Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan speaks during a briefing at the White House, Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019, in Washington.
