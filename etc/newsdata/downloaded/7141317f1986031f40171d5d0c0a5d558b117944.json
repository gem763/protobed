Other data shows a similar pattern:According to a recent survey by YCharts, an investment research platform, 65% of millennials ages 22-37 say they\u2019ll reach seven-figure wealth by age 45 or sooner. And a survey released earlier this year from TD Ameritrade that found that more than half of millennials expect to be millionaires in their lifetimes, with more than four in 10 saying it\u2019ll happen by 50.\n\nThe high visibility of some of these young, uber-rich folks \u2014 the Mark Zuckerberg effect, if you will \u2014 may help explain why most millennials say they\u2019ll be worth seven figures by 45. And, there is some merit to that: The average age of U.S. investors with $25 million or more is just 47, having dropped 11 years since 2014, according to a survey of 185 Americans by Spectrum Group. While that\u2019s a small sample size, Bloomberg notes that it\u2019s \u201cconsistent with other economic research on the top 0.1 percent\u201d.\n\nAs many a Gen Xer can attest to though, it is unlikely to be the case for millennials \u2014 at least if their current savings rates continue. Fully two-thirds of millennials have nothing saved for retirement, according to a report released this year by the National Institute for Retirement Studies \u2014 and 95% are not properly saving for retirement.\n\n\u201cFinancial experts recommend that millennials set aside 15% or more of their salary for retirement, which is a much higher rule of thumb than recommendations for previous generations. But we find that millennials\u2019 average retirement savings rate, including employers\u2019 matching contributions, is 10% of their salary,\u201d Jennifer Brown, NIRS manager of research, writes in the report.\n\nAll this means it\u2019s pretty unlikely that most millennials will be worth seven figures by the time they\u2019re 45, experts say. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not going to happen,\u201d says Sean Brown, the CEO of YCharts.\n\nSo why do so many think they\u2019ll be rich? They may be \u201cdelusional\u201d about \u201chow much money they are able to save and how much they will be able to earn,\u201d explains Agnes Kowalski, a wealth therapist \u2014 who adds this can happen with people of all ages. But she explains that millennials in particular \u201chave incredibly powerful new belief systems about not capping how much money can be earned\u201d as \u201cthere are so many careers that were nonexistent even 10 years ago\u201d \u2014 which may help explain why they think seven figures is possible.\n\nThe FIRE movement (financial independence, retire early) isn\u2019t helping matters either, says Bobbi Rebell, a certified financial planner and host the Financial Grownup podcast. Many of those doing it are millennials, so others who see that may think they can do it too. Another issue is that the millennials who are good at saving may not do an adequate job investing, says Brown \u2014 which is what experts say can get you to seven figures quicker. A survey from Bankrate found that \u201cmillennials continue to lag behind their elders when it comes to investing in the stock market\u201d with just one third of millennials owning stock, compared to roughly half of Gen Xer and boomers.\n\nStill, the fact that millennials think they might hit seven figures well before their 60s isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, says Prudential\u2019s Vice President of Strategic Initiatives Jim Mahaney. Indeed, he says the fact that they think they might hit a goal like that might actually encourage them to save even more.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, you needn\u2019t have seven figures socked away by 45 to be financially secure. Fidelity recommends that you save four times your annual salary by 45; that means that a person making $75,000 a year should have saved $300,000. By 65 they recommend 10 times your annual salary, or $750,000 in this case.\n\nAs for how much total you\u2019ll want to save before you quit working, Kimberly Foss, president and founder of Empyrion Wealth Management and a certified financial planner says to aim for roughly 25 times your desired annual retirement income in savings \u2014 though this will vary depending on where you live. So in simple terms, if you want to live on $75,000 a year, you\u2019ll want to have socked away nearly $1.9 million. She adds that you should also be able to live on about 4% of your retirement savings, withdrawn annually. So, if you have $1.9 million socked away, if you withdrew 4% of that a year, you\u2019d get $75,000 to spend.\n\nFoss says that you can check on whether you\u2019re on track with your savings by using tools like this MarketWatch calculator or this Vanguard calculator.\n\nThis story was originally published in January 2019 and has been updated.", "description": "New survey shows that most millennials believe they\u2019ll be rich one day \u2014 even though they aren\u2019t right now.", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GZ767_retire_ZG_20181205170013.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-06"}
