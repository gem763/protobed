In January, a French regulator fined Google 50 million euros ($55.5 million) for breaches of privacy laws.\n\nIreland's Data Protection Commissioner is also investigating Google over a complaint alleging breach of privacy laws, while Facebook agreed in July to a record-breaking $5 billion fine in the United States to resolve privacy concerns dating back to its use of people's data in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe Australian lawsuit against Google is seeking unspecified penalties and orders requiring the publication of corrective notices by Google, the ACCC said.\n\nThe Australian regulator said in its lawsuit that Google failed to make clear that people should turn off two location-based settings, \"Location History\" and \"Web & App Activity\", to stop the company collecting and using data from either.\n\nGoogle further misled consumers - and breached Australian consumer law - by telling them the only way to prevent the company from collecting their location data was to stop using its main services like Google Search and Google Maps, the regulator said.\n\n\"We want declarations that the current behaviour should not continue,\" ACCC Chair Rod Sims told reporters in Sydney.\n\n\"We want significant penalties and ... we want Google to have to let people know what has gone on, so that people have a greater awareness of what data is actually being collected here and what it is being used for.\"\n\nThe matter is scheduled for a case management hearing on Nov. 14, according to the Federal Court website.
