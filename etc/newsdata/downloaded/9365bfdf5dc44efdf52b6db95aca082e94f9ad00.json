(AP) \u2014 Russell Okung has been moved up to the Los Angeles Chargers' active roster. The offensive tackle is expected to see his first action of the season Sunday against Chicago.\n\nOkung had been on the non-football injury list since the start of the season after he suffered a pulmonary embolism during a June 1 offseason workout at the team facility.\n\nOkung's addition should help bolster an offensive line that has struggled all year. The Chargers have lost three straight and five of their last six.\n\nThe Chargers placed safety Nasir Adderley on injured reserve Saturday to add Okung. Adderley, a second-round pick in last April's draft, has been plagued by a hamstring injury most of the year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
