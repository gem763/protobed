The DTA said it has facilitated over AU$134 million in government cloud contracts since 2015.\n\nThe DTA in July went to tender for its digital marketplace panel, looking to stand up a new master agreement and create three new categories for government procurement.\n\nIn attempting to spread the AU$6.5 billion spent annually on IT by the Australian government, the marketplace aims to simplify the procurement process and make it easier for businesses of all sizes to access government contracts.\n\nThe agency at the time was hunting for sellers of digital services in the following areas: Strategy and policy; user research and design; agile delivery and governance; software engineering and development; support and operations; content and publishing; change and transformation; training, learning, and development; marketing, communications, and engagement; cybersecurity; data science; and emerging technologies.\n\nIt followed the government in January kicking off a refresh of the whole-of-government telecommunications panel.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "The Digital Transformation Agency has opened its hardware marketplace to sellers, covering enterprise storage, network equipment, and data cabling.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/03/23/0961b7ec-cda4-4a92-8d02-f08d6fb199aa/thumbnail/770x578/1656d9126ac0f7bb53917f9c166a70ce/network-switch-and-utp-ethernet-cables.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
