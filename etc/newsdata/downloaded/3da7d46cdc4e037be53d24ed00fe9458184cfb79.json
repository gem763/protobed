Posts that Facebook deems to be either opinion or satire won\u2019t be labeled as false even if they contain information the fact-checkers determined was inaccurate, the people said.\n\nThe new rules follow Facebook\u2019s acknowledgment last week that it will continue exempting politicians from fact-checks, on the grounds that such comments are newsworthy, as well as a recent controversy arising from a third-party fact checker\u2019s determination that an antiabortion group\u2019s video was false.\n\nThe rules, which haven\u2019t been announced, coincide with Facebook\u2019s decision last week to remove a false designation from a Washington Examiner opinion piece, overriding the conclusion of one of its fact-check partners. That op-ed argued that global-warming climate models have been inaccurate and that the risks of climate change is overblown.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\n\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\n\nDoes getting stoned help get you toned?
