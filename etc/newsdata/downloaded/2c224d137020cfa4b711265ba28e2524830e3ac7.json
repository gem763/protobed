The company says it's intended to help children manage weight by developing healthy habits.\n\nOn September 13th, a dozen people gathered in front of WW's New York City headquarters to protest the Kurbo app. The event was led by Balance Eating Disorder Treatment Center, which had previously protested WW in 2018 when the company launched a promotion offering free memberships to teenagers.\n\nThe treatment center has said it believes the company is trying to profit off the insecurity of children and their parents, promoting unhealthy attitudes toward food by encouraging calorie-tracking and stigmatizing high-calorie foods like avocados, nuts, and dairy as \"red light\" items to be limited.\n\nRead more: Weight Watchers made a 'healthy eating' app for kids.
