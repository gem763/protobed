They were awesome while they lasted.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nMike Scott was among the NBA players who embraced the look. (Elsa/Getty Images)\n\nIf you followed the NBA last season, you saw them.\n\nWrapped elegantly around the head like a Japanese Hachimaki, there\u2019s no doubt they were aesthetically pleasing. The so-called \u201cninja-style\u201d headbands streaked behind players like the contrails of a jet and took the league by storm, adding an extra layer of oomph to every dunk, block and three pointer made by those who wore them.\n\nJimmy Butler, Jrue Holiday and Mike Scott were among the players who embraced the look, and by the end of last season the headbands appeared destined to become a league staple. But after reports this week, it\u2019s clear they were more akin to a shooting star: here for a brief moment and gone the next.\n\nIn a decision seemingly no one asked for, the league said Monday the ninja headgear would not be permitted this upcoming season. A league spokesman told The Washington Post that members of the NBA\u2019s competition committee met on Monday and expressed \u201cconcerns on safety;\u201d namely, the looseness of the bands.\n\n\n\nDe'Aaron Fox of the Sacramento Kings in March. (Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe ninja-style headwear is not part of the NBA uniform and hasn\u2019t been through the league approval process,\u201d Mike Bass said in a statement. \u201cTeams have raised concerns regarding safety and consistency of size, length and how they are tied, which requires a thorough review before consideration of any rule change.\u201d\n\nTragic.\n\nTeams were notified of the ruling in May, Bass added, but the league \u201cdid not want to cause a disruption\u201d by forcing players to stop wearing them midseason. There\u2019s no definitive answer as to how long a \u201cthorough review\u201d will take, but it\u2019s clear that won\u2019t happen before the next season begins in October.\n\nSome have taken a more cynical view and speculated the NBA\u2019s edict on the headbands was because the league wasn\u2019t able to market them, a concern that is floated after many NBA apparel decisions. In July, Nike reportedly derailed LeBron James\u2019s plan to gift his new Lakers\u2019 teammate Anthony Davis his prized No. 23 jersey, apparently because of \u201cproduction issues and the massive financial hit\u201d that would have reached into the \u201ctens of millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nDavis opted to wear No. 3 instead.\n\nWhile there\u2019s a debate about who wore the headgear first in the NBA (the inspiration may have been tennis star Rafael Nadal, who won his 19th Grand Slam singles title this week while wearing a $769,000 watch), the look appeared to be an overwhelming hit among fans and players alike. One of those players was Scott, who was also the first to unofficially report the ban Friday:\n\nIn another tweet, Scott alleged he was told the headgear was \u201ctoo unprofessional,\u201d a loaded phrase with worrisome connotations that recalls the NBA\u2019s effort to formalize its dress code in the mid-2000s.\n\nNo matter the motive, the decision has upset a number of the league\u2019s stars. The Washington Wizards\u2019 Isaiah Thomas and the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 Montrezl Harrell were among a handful to speak out, with the latter using several expletives to express his bewilderment over the league\u2019s \u201csafety\u201d explanation.\n\nthe NBA\u2019s All Ninja Headband Team just cuz:\n\n\n\nG: De\u2019Aaron Fox\n\nG: Jrue Holiday\n\nF: Jimmy Butler\n\nF: LeBron James*\n\nC: Montrezl Harrell pic.twitter.com/M8DdSk3Odb \u2014 Dan Favale (@danfavale) September 9, 2019\n\nWhat hurts most, perhaps, is that we\u2019ll no longer be able to see which players planned to debut the ninja headband next season. Heck, even LeBron James teased fans with a photo in a July Instagram post, in which he unironically referred to himself as \u201cBruce Lee-Bron.\u201d James has since posted several photos of himself working out while wearing a ninja headband.\n\nBut it appears fans won\u2019t get to see \u201cKung Fu King\u201d on an NBA court, at least not anytime soon.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s take a moment to appreciate the single season of joy the ninja headbands gave us.\n\nRead More:\n\nSign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox\n\n\u2018Insane numbers\u2019: NBA stars welcome Elena Delle Donne to 50-40-90 club\n\nThe Wizards could learn a thing or two from the Mystics, the best team in the WNBA\n\nTeam USA shuts down Giannis Antetokounmpo, wallops Greece in FIBA World Cup", "description": "These ninja-style headbands looked awesome.
