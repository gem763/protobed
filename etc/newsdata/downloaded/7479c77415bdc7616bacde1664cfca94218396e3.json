AB-Inbev is the world\u2019s largest beer maker, and apart from SA brands like Castle and Black Label also owns Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois.\n\nThe company reported that its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) was flat for the quarter. The market was expecting a rise of 3%, Reuters reported.\n\nIts share price slumped 10% in the first 20 minutes of trading, to hit R1 204. By 10:30, its share price was around 9.4% lower at R1 216.\n\nTotal volumes sold fell by 0.5% in the third quarter, with its own beer volumes down 0.9% and non-beer volumes up 4.0%, the company reported.\n\n\"Solid growth from markets such as Mexico, South Africa and Colombia was more than offset by declines in China and the US, both primarily driven by shipment phasing impacts.\"\n\nIts revenue grew by 2.7% over the past quarter, but while the company says it has now achieved $3.32bn in cost savings since taking over SABMiller, its cost of sales increased by 6.9% in the third quarter due to higher input costs and a weakening in the currencies in some of its markets.\n\nIts profit margin contracted as a result, with its Ebitda margin contracting by 107 basis points to 40.2%.\n\nIts underlying earnings per share (which excludes gains thanks to hedging contracts for share-based payments and the impact of hyperinflation) fell to $0.94 in the third quarter from $1.11 a year ago. For the first nine months of its financial year, its underlying earnings fell by more than 5%.", "description": "Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s share price lost 10% in the first few minutes of trading after its trading updated disappointed the market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9396/f1cb6ac4d0ac4a3c84dd277bc92ed7eb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
