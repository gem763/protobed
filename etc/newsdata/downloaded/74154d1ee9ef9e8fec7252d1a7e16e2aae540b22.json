Its origins lie over two centuries ago\u2026.\"\n\nSo begins this four-part series on the 'nakba', meaning the 'catastrophe', about the history of the Palestinian exodus that led to the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948, and the establishment of the state of Israel.\n\nThis sweeping history starts back in 1799 with Napoleon's attempted advance into Palestine to check British expansion and his appeal to the Jews of the world to reclaim their land in league with France.\n\nThe narrative moves through the 19th century and into the 20th century with the British Mandate in Palestine and comes right up to date in the 21st century and the ongoing 'nakba' on the ground.\n\nArab, Israeli and Western intellectuals, historians and eye-witnesses provide the central narrative which is accompanied by archive material and documents, many only recently released for the first time.\n\nEditor's note: Since first running on Al Jazeera Arabic in 2008, this series has won Arab and international awards and has been well received at festivals throughout the world.\n\nEPISODE ONE:\n\nFor Palestinians, 1948 marks the 'nakba' or the 'catastrophe', when hundreds of thousands were forced out of their homes.\n\nThe tragedy in Palestine is not just a local one; it is a tragedy for the world, because it is an injustice that is a menace to the world's peace. Arnold Toynbee, British historian\n\nBut for Israelis, the same year marks the creation of their own state.\n\nThis series attempts to present an understanding of the events of the past that are still shaping the present.\n\nThis story starts in 1799, outside the walls of Acre in Ottoman-controlled Palestine, when an army under Napoleon Bonaparte besieged the city. It was all part of a campaign to defeat the Ottomans and establish a French presence in the region.\n\nIn search of allies, Napoleon issued a letter offering Palestine as a homeland to the Jews under French protection. He called on the Jews to \u2018rise up\u2019 against what he called their oppressors.\n\nNapoleon\u2019s appeal was widely publicised. But he was ultimately defeated. In Acre today, the only memory of him is a statue atop a hill overlooking the city.\n\nYet Napoleon's project for a Jewish homeland in the region under a colonial protectorate did not die, 40 years later, the plan was revived but by the British.\n\nEPISODE TWO:\n\nOn 19 April 1936, the Palestinians launched a national strike to protest against mass Jewish immigration and what they saw as Britain\u2019s alliance with the Zionist movement.\n\nThe British responded with force. During the six months of the strike, over 190 Palestinians were killed and more than 800 wounded.\n\nWary of popular revolt, Arab leaders advised the Palestinians to end the strike.\n\nPalestinian leaders bowed to pressure from the Arab heads of state and agreed to meet the British Royal Commission of Inquiry headed by Lord Peel.\n\nIn its report of July 1937, the Peel Commission recommended the partition of Palestine. Its report drew the frontiers of a Jewish state in one-third of Palestine, and an Arab state in the remaining two-thirds, to be merged with Transjordan.\n\nA corridor of land from Jerusalem to Jaffa would remain under British mandate. The Commission also recommended transferring where necessary Palestinians from the lands allocated to the new Jewish state.\n\nThe Commission's proposals were widely published and provoked heated debate.\n\nAs the Palestinian revolt continued, Britain\u2019s response hardened. Between 1936 and 1937, the British killed over 1,000 Palestinians; 37 British military police and 69 Jews also died.\n\nEPISODE THREE:\n\nFew Palestinians, if any, could have imagined they were to become victims of what would later be called \"ethnic cleansing\".\n\nWhen the British were preparing to leave Palestine, we didn't have weapons. My father gave me money and I bought a gun with only three bullets for 100 Palestinian liras. Sami Kamal Abdul Razek, palestinian refugee After 30 years of British rule, the question of Palestine was referred to the United Nations, which had become the forum for conflict.\n\nOn 29 November 1947, the UN General Assembly met to devise a plan for the partition of Palestine. UN Resolution 181 divided Palestine into an Arab and a Jewish state, with Jerusalem as an internationalised city.\n\nThe Jewish state was granted 56 percent of the land; the city of Jaffa was included as an enclave of the Arab state; and the land known today as the Gaza Strip was split from its surrounding agricultural regions.\n\nBut making the proposed Arab state all but proved impractical in the eyes of many Palestinians.\n\nWhen the draft resolution was presented for voting, Arab newspapers ran a 'name and shame' list of the countries that voted for the UN partition plan, and Arab protesters took to the streets.\n\nFollowing the partition resolution, Britain announced it would end its mandate in Palestine on 14 May 1948.\n\nEPISODE FOUR:\n\nIn early 1948, Jewish paramilitary forces began to seize more land in Palestine. By the end of July, more than 400,000 Palestinians had been forced to flee their homes, and their plight as refugees had just begun.\n\nI swear to God, we tasted it; we tasted starvation like no one else did. Hosni Mohammad Smada, Palestinian refugee In May of that year, Swedish diplomat Count Folke Bernadotte had been appointed as the UN Mediator in Palestine. His mission was to seek a peaceful settlement.\n\nThe Count surveyed devastated Palestinian villages and visited refugee camps in both Palestine and Jordan. The scale of the humanitarian disaster became apparent, as he witnessed cramp living conditions, long queues for basic food and scarce medical aid.\n\nCount Bernadotte was no stranger to human disaster; with the Red Cross he had rescued over 30,000 prisoners of war from Nazi concentration camps. Now he advocated the Palestinian's right to return to their homes.\n\nIn a report dated 16 September 1948, he wrote:\n\n\"It would be an offence against the principles of elementary justice if these innocent victims were denied the right to return to their homes, while Jewish immigrants flow into Palestine, and, indeed, at least offer the threat of permanent replacement of the Arab refugees who have been rooted in the land for centuries.\"\n\nThe Count's first proposal argued for fixed boundaries through negotiation, an economic union between both states, and the return of Palestinian refugees - the proposal was turned down.\n\nOn 17 September, the day following his UN report, Count Bernadotte's motorcade was ambushed in Jerusalem. He was shot at point blank range by members of the Jewish Stern gang.\n\nAl Nakba Debate:\n\nThe historic struggle for Palestine is characterised as the claims and counter-claims of Arabs and Jews, but one factor that is often overlooked behind the Palestinian 'nakba' or 'catastrophe' of 1948, is the part played by an old imperial power, Britain.\n\nSo, whose interests were best served by the British in Palestine? How did it honour its mandated duty of care? and what were the calculations and miscalculations it made in redrawing the map of Palestine, and reshaping its history?\n\nThe 65 years of the Israeli statehood, continue to cause conflict and controversy.\n\nThe history is written by the victors, who are the rewriters of history as new information, new documents, and new historians, come to light. It is time to examine how history itself is the battleground for the hearts and minds of new generations today.\n\nTo discuss the historic events that led to the 'nakba', the birth of Israel, and the making of history, we are joined by Rosemary Hollis, former head of the Middle East programme at the Royal Insitute of International Affairs; James Renton, senior lecturer in History at Edge Hill University and author of The Zionist Masquerade: The birth of the Anglo-Zionist alliance 1914-1918 ; and Avi Shalam, a professor of International Relations at Oxford University and author of the Collusion across the Jordan: King Abdullah, The Zionist Movement, and the Partition Of Palestine.\n\nSource: Al Jazeera", "description": "A series on the Palestinian 'catastrophe' of 1948 that led to dispossession and conflict that still endures.", "authors": ["Special Series", "Arnold Toynbee", "British Historian", "Sami Kamal Abdul Razek", "Palestinian Refugee", "Hosni Mohammad Smada"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2013/5/2/201352112433310734_20.jpg", "published_at": "2013-05-20"}
