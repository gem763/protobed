The $77 million deal made the cryptocurrency exchange the majority shareholder in Pantronics, with an over 73 percent stake in the company.\n\nThe deal was reported at the time as potentially providing Huobi the opportunity to go public in Hong Kong via a process known as a reverse takeover.\n\nHowever, the move could be affected by the stricter regulations (pdf) on backdoor IPOs from HKEX planned for Oct. 1. The stock exchange said it would make changes to its current regulations, making such transactions more difficult for those that acquire another publicly listed company in different industries based in Hong Kong.\n\nOther major companies in the cryptocurrency space are also seeking to go public in different jurisdictions, after stalled attempts in Hong Kong.\n\nRelated: The State of Security Token Regulations in Asia\n\nAfter mining giant Bitmain\u2019s IPO attempt in Hong Kong was allowed to expire, apparently due to reluctance from HKEX, it\u2019s reportedly now planning to list in the U.S. Another miner manufacturer, Canaan Creative, is also reported to have already confidentially filed in the U.S. after a failed HKEX attempt.\n\nHKEX image via Shutterstock; Pantronics document via HKEX\n\nRelated Stories", "description": "A filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange backs up earlier suggestions that Huobi seeks to go public through a firm acquired in 2018.", "authors": ["David Pan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gb0eTvZIvN6XtJ5ClnjjcQ--~B/aD04MTI7dz0xNTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/f975f619f1c70bdf6e81b290650389de", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
