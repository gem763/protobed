He spent about a year refurbishing it and transforming it into a unique vacation rental. Last month, it opened to guests.\n\nApple Camping\n\n\"Since we opened the airbus to guests, we've had 12 families stay with us and they've all loved it,\" Davies told The Daily Mail. \"I'm very proud of how it's turned out and it's very satisfying to see it come together.\"\n\nThe jet is capable of sleeping four guests. And while it's reminiscent of the free-spirit of travel, guests won't have to rough it. There's a hot water shower, toilet, and outside deck area, complete with barbecue.\n\nApple Camping\n\nThe 27-year-old Airbus was originally owned by Air Canada, then leased to Air Malta and purchased by Etihad in 2003. The Emirati airline retired the plane last year and sent it to the scrapyard, where Davies claimed it.\n\nThe body of the plane had to be cut in half to transport it, but that gave Davies the opportunity to create a protected outdoor area for guests. \"I didn't plan to do any of this, it's just happened because of the circumstances - you just need to crack on and come up with new ideas,\" he told The Daily Mail.\n\nApple Camping\n\nNights in the Airbus start at about $220 per night (\u00a3179) and it's possible to book online.\n\nBut the Airbus is not the only aviation-themed accommodation on the campsite. In 2016, Davies debuted his 1970s private jet that he transformed into a vacation rental. The one-bedroom plane/accommodation is available from about $150 (\u00a3125) per night.\n\nIn case the planes are already booked, Apple Campsite has several other quirky accommodations; you can also book a night in a UFO, a Pac-Man dome, or a disco chapel.", "description": "Toby Rhys Davies spent about a year transforming a former Etihad Airbus jumbo jet into a unique glamping venue.", "authors": ["Cailey Rizzo", "Travel"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8a436c2e22af05fb5563ff-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
