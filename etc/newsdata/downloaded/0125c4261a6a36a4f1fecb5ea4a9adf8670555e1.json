General Assembly. \u201cIf you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? One of the reasons the new president got elected is he was going to stop corruption. So it's very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption. Very important.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s defense comes as reports of the call have reinvigorated a push for his impeachment by Democrats who say the president\u2019s decision to urge an investigation into Biden was out of bounds. Also at issue with critics of the president is $250 million in foreign aid meant for Ukraine that the White House mysteriously withheld before releasing under bipartisan pressure early this month. There is no evidence that Trump directly tied the release of foreign aid to an investigation into Biden and his son.\n\nTrump also said he was \u201cnot at all\u201d taking seriously the threat of impeachment in light of the latest revelations and again insisted that everything he said to President Volodymyr Zelensky during a late July phone call had been above board.\n\nJoin our reporters for live coverage of the U.N.

General Assembly ADD TO GOOGLE CALENDAR\n\n\u201cWe had a perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine \u2014 everybody knows it,\u201d he said, casting the issue as a repeat of the Russia investigation, which he alleged was meant to derail his presidency. \u201cHere we go again. They failed with Russia, they failed with recession, they failed with everything. And now they\u2019re bringing this up.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s story has evolved somewhat in the days since House Democrats\u2019 struggle to get an anonymous whistleblower complaint spilled out into the public and details about the contents of the complaint began leaking out into the press. Trump first danced around the subject of whether he brought up Biden, whom Trump has accused of using his vice presidential perch to fire a Ukranian prosecutor investigating the company connected to his son, Hunter.\n\nBut on Sunday, Trump appeared to acknowledge for the first time that he raised the subject in his call with the newly elected leader.\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory. It was largely corruption \u2014 all of the corruption taking place,\u201d Trump told reporters while departing the White House. \u201cIt was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nBiden, for his part, has forcefully denied any wrongdoing and ripped Trump and his allies for suggesting otherwise. Over the weekend in Iowa, Biden called reports of Trump\u2019s outreach an apparent \u201coverwhelming abuse of power.\u201d He's also called for Trump to release the transcript of his phone call with Zelensky, something the president has suggested was a possibility.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Trump had pressured Zelensky around eight times to investigate Biden and his son during the call, telling the Ukranian president to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who has also been pushing the issue in the press.\n\nTrump on Monday also cast doubt on the whistleblower whose complaint set off the scramble to learn more about Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky. Though the intelligence community\u2019s internal watchdog, a Trump appointee, deemed the complaint was urgent and credible enough to meet the statutory threshold requiring it be turned over to Congress, Trump and his allies have painted the complainant as a partisan adversary of the president.\n\n\u201cThese people are stone cold Crooked,\u201d Trump said of his detractors in a tweet, before accusing the whistleblower of getting unspecified facts wrong.\n\n\u201cAlso, who is this so-called \u2018whistleblower\u2019 who doesn\u2019t know the correct facts. Is he on our Country\u2019s side. Where does he come from. Is this all about Schiff & the Democrats again after years of being wrong?\u201d he asked.\n\nTrump also suggested that the drive to investigate the newest allegations was borne out of Democratic disdain that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation was insufficiently politically damning.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what Biden did, Biden did what they would like to have me do,\u201d Trump claimed Monday to reporters. \u201cExcept for one problem: I didn't do it.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Reports of the call have reinvigorated a push for his impeachment by Democrats.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3776/1155968404_6088756269001_6088755453001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
