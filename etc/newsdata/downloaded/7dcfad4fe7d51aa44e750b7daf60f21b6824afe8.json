But latest global figures show about 86 per cent coverage with a first measles vaccine dose and less than 70 per cent for a second dose.\n\nThere has been a resurgence of measles around the world since 2016, and WHO experts said the situation was \u2018alarming\u2019.\n\nIn Europe, the number of cases in the first half of 2019 outstripped that for the whole of last year. Nearly 90,000 cases and 37 deaths were reported across 48 of the 53 countries in the European region between January and June this year.\n\nMajor outbreaks of the illness have also killed thousands in Madagascar, the Philippines, Sudan, Thailand and Ukraine.\n\nIn the UK just 90.3 per cent of children had their first dose in 2018-19, down from 91.2 per cent the year before. And just 86.4 per cent had received their second dose by their fifth birthday.", "description": "There were 364,808 cases of measles reported to the World Health Organisation in the first six months of this year - triple the amount in 2018 and the highest level since 2006.", "authors": ["Eleanor Hayward For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/23/19609290-0-image-a-16_1570831684233.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
