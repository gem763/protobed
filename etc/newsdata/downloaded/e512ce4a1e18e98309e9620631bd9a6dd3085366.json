In a short time, the responsibility for forming the government will be given to Benjamin Netanyahu, after which President Rivlin and Prime Minister Netanyahu will give remarks,\u201d Rivlin tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nShortly thereafter, Netanyahu made a televised appearance confirming the decision. \u201cTonight, I received the mandate to establish the government from the hands of President Reuben Rivlin. I thank him and thank you, citizens of Israel,\u201d Netanyahu said Wednesday. \u201cI will make every effort to establish the only government possible for Israel at this time\u2014a broad national unity government.\u201d\n\nRivlin chose Netanyahu over the prime minister\u2019s main rival, centrist Benny Gantz. If Netanyahu proves unsuccessful at forming a government\u2014once again\u2014Gantz will likely be given a chance.\n\nIsrael\u2019s unprecedented repeat election earlier this month delivered yet another deadlocked vote, falling short of what was necessary for Gantz to unseat Netanyahu as the next prime minister. If Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party had gained enough votes, it would have signaled an end to Netnayahu\u2019s record-setting 10 consecutive years in the position. The final tally instead saw Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud party adding an extra seat in parliament.\n\nThe election was the second time within a year that Israelis were asked to vote for a prime minister.\n\nNetanyahu and Gantz first went head-to-head in April, but when results from that election were deemed too close to call, the whole country was left on a cliffhanger. After both men declared victory and Netanyahu failed to form a coalition government, it was decided that a do-over election would be held months later. The decision marked the first time in the country\u2019s history that new elections were forcibly held due to a failure to form a government.\n\nDespite being given a second chance to form a government, Netanyahu is still facing three separate corruption cases that include charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust. Israel\u2019s Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit has said he intends to indict Netanyahu, but will officially decide whether to press charges after a long-delayed hearing in October.\n\nSquelching the charges is expected to be the prime minister\u2019s first order of business after forming a government. Netanyahu is relying on his hard-line religious and nationalist allies to grant him immunity from prosecution\u2014but in order for that to be a possibility, he first has to secure a 61-seat majority in the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament.\n\nWith only 55 seats in parliament that officially endorsed his bid for another term\u2014only one more than Gantz\u2019s 54 seats\u2014the prime minister now has 28 days to assemble a 61 seat majority. Netanyahu faces an unenviable uphill battle to close that crucial six-seat deficit to form a coalition government.\n\nNetanyahu was unsuccessful last time around in large part because of one man: Avigdor Liberman. Once Netanyahu\u2019s political partner and director-general of his office, the prime minister later publicly disavowed his actions, leading Liberman to quit the post. When he returned to politics, Liberman created his own party and became a volatile member of the Knesset, quitting or getting fired at least five times. In the last election, it was Liberman\u2019s refusal to join his party in a coalition with Netanyahu that precipitated the do-over election.\n\nIn an effort to lock down a majority at the polls, the prime minister aggressively campaigned on protecting national security in hopes of firing up his nationalist base.\n\nWith only a few months to turn the tide from the last national election, Netanyahu made unfounded claims that Arabs\u2014which make up about 20 percent of the country\u2019s population, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics\u2014conspired with his opponent to steal the election. The prime minister also claimed that areas where the ethnic group is prevalent have fallen victim to voter fraud, and unsuccessfully proposed setting up cameras in polling stations on election day, an idea that was largely seen as an attempt to suppress Arab Israeli turnout.\n\nThe tactics are reminiscent of Republican efforts in the United States to question traditional vote counting procedures, and President Trump\u2019s unfounded claims of voter suppression.", "description": "The prime minister still faces indictment for three separate corruption cases.", "authors": ["Audrey Mcnamara"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2258,w_4015,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568731046/RTX739ZE_lubcc6", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
