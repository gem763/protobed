Yet maintaining the arrangement is paramount to the success of both.\n\nRelations between Beijing and the semiautonomous city now face their biggest test since the U.K. handed back the territory in 1997, as protests sparked by legislation that would have permitted extraditions to the mainland mushroom into a wider movement. Many fear that Beijing could ultimately intervene directly. Strident official rhetoric comparing the more violent protests with terrorism and accusing participants of being influenced by foreign \u201cblack hands\u201d raises the stakes of backing down.\n\nStill, direct intervention would be hugely risky for Beijing\u2014not just politically, but also for China\u2019s global economic ambitions, financial stability, and ability to attract foreign capital and expertise to fuel its own growth.\n\nOn pure size, Hong Kong carries far less heft relative to the mainland than in the late 1990s. Its output was 3% as large as the mainland\u2019s in 2018, against nearly a fifth in 1997.\n\nBut the city remains central to China\u2019s economy. It is its main interface with global capital markets, the conduit for most foreign direct investment in China, and a big source of assets sitting on Chinese banks\u2019 and property developers\u2019 balance sheets. Sudden disruption to all this would have unpredictable\u2014perhaps unmanageable\u2014effects on China\u2019s own rickety financial system.\n\nMoreover, China\u2019s own reluctance to push forward with reforms has only raised the value of Hong Kong as a buffer between the mainland and global capital markets. Following the Shanghai stock-market crash and Chinese currency crisis of 2015, China has progressively tightened its grip on capital flows into and out of the country. The \u201cconnects\u201d between Hong Kong financial markets and mainland markets are the easiest pathway for foreign investors to buy Chinese assets, and the offshore yuan market centered in Hong Kong offers Beijing additional ways to discourage currency speculators.\n\nWhile Hong Kong is legally part of China, the People\u2019s Republic guaranteed it a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d until 2047 as a condition of the 1997 handover. It has its own Western-style legal system, currency and trade agreements. The U.S. and other major powers treat it as a separate legal jurisdiction. Should the U.S. reconsider that status, as legislators have threatened in the event of aggressive action by Chinese authorities, Hong Kong could become subject to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, technology-export controls, or visa changes.\n\nFirst in a Series Even before protests shook Hong Kong this summer, there was widespread fatalism about its future as a financial and trade center. But Beijing\u2019s dependence on the \u201cspecial administrative region\u201d runs far deeper than it might appear. This series takes an in-depth look at the economic stakes for China and Hong Kong in the current upheaval.\n\nThe hit to Chinese trade would be manageable. Mainland China\u2019s coastal container port throughput, which was less than twice as large as Hong Kong\u2019s seaborne throughput in 2001, is now more than 10 times as big.\n\nBut the financial impact of a loss of confidence could be severe. Chinese investment inflows into Hong Kong over the past two decades have been gargantuan, which is one reason why property there is so pricey. Should capital flight tank the property market\u2014or undermine the Hong Kong dollar\u2019s longtime peg to the greenback\u2014Chinese property developers and banks would likely sustain serious damage. The impact could be magnified if the yuan simultaneously came under pressure, or international political pressure curtailed Chinese companies\u2019 ability to refinance dollar debt.\n\nEven assuming the immediate financial turbulence could be contained, any change in the status quo would cause severe long-run damage. Around 60% of foreign direct investment into China flows through Hong Kong, although much of this comes from offshore Chinese companies.\n\nInvestors like funneling cash into China through Hong Kong because the city\u2019s legal and regulatory system\u2014combined with the substantial Hong Kong footprint of wealthy Chinese and Chinese companies\u2014means investors have real recourse in the event of disputes. Singapore and Shanghai simply can\u2019t offer the same combination of rule of law, open capital account, stable currency and Chinese \u201cskin in the game.\u201d If investors conclude Hong Kong is no longer a reliable base for jumping into China, foreign investment into the nation as a whole may take a substantial, permanent hit. On Friday credit ratings company Fitch, citing deteriorating international perceptions of governance and the rule of law, downgraded Hong Kong for the first time since 1995.\n\nA \u201cLady Liberty Hong Kong\u201d statue stands in Hong Kong\u2019s Central district.

So far, European and other Asian nations haven\u2019t presented a united front with the U.S. on trade relations, but a tragedy in Hong Kong might change their calculus.\n\nHong Kongers have the most to lose if matters deteriorate, but Beijing\u2019s dependence on the city runs far deeper than it might appear.\n\nWrite to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com", "description": "Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d has always been viewed with deep ambivalence in the ultra-capitalist city and Beijing alike, but maintaining the arrangement is paramount to the success of both.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Taplin", "Nathaniel.Taplin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105190/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
