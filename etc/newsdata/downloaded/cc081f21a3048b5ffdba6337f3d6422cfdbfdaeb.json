Jewellers were placing orders from across the country,\u201d said one Mumbai-based dealer at a bullion-importing private bank.\n\nDealers were offering a discount of up to $12 an ounce to official domestic prices on Friday, down from a $40 discount on Thursday and up to $47 last week. The domestic price includes a 12.5% import tax and 3% sales tax.\n\nRetail demand, however, remained lacklustre this week because of the Shradh period, which is considered inauspicious for buying bullion, said one Kolkata bullion dealer.\n\n\u201cFrom next week retail demand will start improving,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are entering peak festive season.\u201d\n\nDemand for gold usually strengthens in the final quarter as India gears up for festivals such as Diwali and Dussehra.\n\nHowever, Singapore dealer GoldSilver Central\u2019s managing director, Brian Lan, said that demand could be tempered during that period if prices remain very high, noting a six-year peak scaled early this month.\n\nIn China, the world\u2019s biggest gold consumer, dealers charged premiums in a range of about $8 to $12 an ounce over the benchmark, compared with $10 a week ago.\n\nPremiums in Hong Kong were largely unchanged for a third week running, in an approximate range of 50 cents to $1, traders said, citing recent civil rights protests for curbed jewellery demand.\n\nThere have been some investments in bullion as the U.S.-China trade war and Hong Kong protests increased safe-haven interest in gold, but overall demand has been muted, one Hong Kong-based trader said.\n\nHaving risen to a more than two-week high earlier in the week, global benchmark spot gold prices are now on track for a weekly decline of about 1.8%.
