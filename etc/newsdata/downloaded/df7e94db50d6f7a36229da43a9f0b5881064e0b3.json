Whether this is a feat of science or mere prestidigitation is a matter of some debate in the AI community right now.\n\nIn case you missed it, OpenAI posted an article on its blog last week titled \u201cSolving Rubik\u2019s Cube With a Robot Hand.\u201d Based on this title, you\u2019d be forgiven if you thought the research discussed in said article was about solving Rubik\u2019s Cube with a robot hand. It is not.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, OpenAI created a software and machine learning pipeline by which a robot hand can physically manipulate a Rubik\u2019s Cube from an \u2018unsolved\u2019 state to a solved one. But the truly impressive bit here is that a robot hand can hold an object and move it around (to accomplish a goal) without dropping it.\n\nThe robot, which is just a hand, doesn\u2019t actually figure out how to solve the puzzle. An old-school non-AI algorithm does the math using sensor data, then it transmits each step to the hand in succession. The hand just follows directions.\n\nIt\u2019s relatively simple to create a purpose-built machine designed to perform a specific function in a perfect environment. Here\u2019s a machine that can \u201csolve\u201d the Rubik\u2019s Cube in less than a second:\n\nBut that machine can\u2019t do it with one hand, under unpredictable, adverse conditions.\n\nOpenAI had to develop a training method that constantly challenges the AI to figure out new ways of solving a problem. As soon as the AI came up with a method that works well, thus becoming complacent, the researchers would change things up. This kept it ready for things it\u2019d never encountered in more than 10,000 hours of simulation training.\n\nIn the real world, the researchers physically messed with it by pushing and shoving it while it tried to work.\n\nThese perturbations resulted in the training of an AI that can process all the physics (gravity, friction, etc.) involved in keeping the hand on task.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t as robust at performing this task as you might think. Consider this bit at the end of OpenAI\u2018s blog post:\n\nOur method currently solves the Rubik\u2019s Cube 20% of the time when applying a maximally difficult scramble that requires 26 face rotations. For simpler scrambles that require 15 rotations to undo, the success rate is 60%.\n\nRemember, when it \u201cfails\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t figure out the puzzle. It means that it\u2019s either dropped it or fumbled its attempts to spin the cube\u2019s sides until time ran out. But, it\u2019s still impressive nonetheless.\n\nThe Rubik\u2019s Cube puzzle is just a placeholder for \u201cwhatever problem you need a robot hand to solve.\u201d It could just as easily be tasked with juggling tomatoes without squishing them or playing a piano while people throw beer bottles at it, and it would essentially be the same kind of accomplishment.\n\nUnfortunately, the language OpenAI used to describe this incredible cutting-edge AI research makes it look like it\u2019s \u2018solved\u2019 a Rubik\u2019s Cube using deep learning neural networks. Which would not only be, as far as we know, the first time anyone\u2019s done such a thing, but probably pointless \u2013 refer to the machine above that can do it in less than a second.\n\nThe point is: a robot hand that can do random stuff is a much, much more impressive accomplishment than using an old algorithm to align the colors on a Rubik\u2019s Cube. In machine learning, \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cbroad\u201d tasks are generally much more difficult to pull off than \u201cspecific\u201d or \u201cnarrow\u201d tasks. It\u2019s easier to build a Rubik\u2019s Cube solver than a hand that doesn\u2019t drop stuff.\n\nGary Marcus, CEO of Robust AI and author of the just-released \u201cRebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust,\u201d took immediate exception to OpenAI\u2019s blog post. He called it misleading and intimated that OpenAI was, once again, causing the media to print overzealous, hyperbolic headlines and stories.\n\nSince @OpenAI still has not changed misleading blog post about \"solving the Rubik's cube\", I attach detailed analysis, comparing what they say and imply with what they actually did. IMHO most would not be obvious to nonexperts.

You may feel I made these points because I have a book out, but fact is I have been puncturing hype & championing nativism & hybrid models for 30 years. I will always stand up for what I believe. https://t.co/MinHbnubJH \u2014 Gary Marcus (@GaryMarcus) October 22, 2019\n\nAnd everyone else seems torn between calling Marcus and those who agree with him pedantic and OpenAI intentionally misleading. Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Zachary Lipton called the research \u201cinteresting\u201d and the PR behind it \u201cweapons-grade.\u201d\n\nSo to elaborate a bit because the @nytimes included just a tiny snippet, I think *this @OpenAI research is interesting* and I generally think *demos are terrific*. However, I don't like this pattern where weapons-grade press releases are primary vector for disseminating research. https://t.co/MYnF6Ufy8k \u2014 Zachary Lipton (@zacharylipton) October 15, 2019\n\nAnd perhaps he has a point, after all the Washington Post published an article titled \u201cThis Robotic Hand Learned to Solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube on its Own \u2013 Just Like A Human.\u201d That\u2019s a headline that feels like it\u2019s straddling the border between poor interpretation and outright poppycock.\n\nIn OpenAI\u2018s defense, it doesn\u2019t control the media. But, to OpenAI\u2018s detriment, it kinda does control the media. It\u2019s a non-profit co-founded by Elon Musk (no longer involved) that just received a billion dollars from Microsoft in a much ballyhooed \u201cpartnership\u201d to \u201cdevelop human-level AI\u201d that just looks like a marketing deal for Azure. It\u2019s no stranger to press coverage.\n\nFurthermore, OpenAI recently stirred up controversy after choosing to withhold the models for an open-source AI text-generator over concerns it wouldn\u2019t be ethical to release it to the public (to be fair, it\u2019s pretty scary). OpenAI knows exactly what kind of controversy it\u2019s courting when it presents these stories to the media. Critics claim it doesn\u2019t do quite enough to head these stories off or disabuse the general public of hyperbolic notions.\n\nOpenAI says it contacts journalists when articles don\u2019t get the story right.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a shame. The real story, the amazing robot hand that can manipulate physical objects in a non-optimized environment, is a great one. Unfortunately, it\u2019s been largely swallowed up in the noise.\n\nFor more information on OpenAI\u2018s cool robot hand, check out the team\u2019s research paper here.\n\nRead next: Ajit Pai wants to abolish federalism so Verizon and AT&T can throttle your data", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FopenAI.jpg&signature=2f8e6e5d9c3bc19d5a852fe14ceab00f", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
