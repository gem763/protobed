The resolution establishes procedures for open hearings, authorizes the release of deposition transcripts, and outlines how the intelligence community can transfer evidence to the House judiciary committee\n\nIt directs \u201ccertain committees to continue their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, president of the United States of America, and for other purposes,\u201d the document reads.\n\nThe document gives Schiff the lead role in the investigation, giving him power to organize the questioning of witnesses. The committee will take over the probe, which until now has been handled by three committees, including intelligence, foreign affairs, and oversight and reform.\n\nThe resolution also gives House Republicans the power to request their own documents and testimony.\n\nThe document will go to the House Rules Committee for markup before the Thursday vote.\n\nAs Breitbart News\u2019 senior editor Joel Pollak writes, the measure\u2019s proposed rules raise red flags about the probe\u2019s fairness:\n\n1. The resolution gives authority to the House Intelligence Committee that it has never had before. 2. The resolution does not provide the minority with equal subpoena power, as in the past. 3. The resolution waters down minority powers over the release of Intelligence transcripts. 4. The resolution does not compel the release of past testimony. 5. The resolution restricts the president\u2019s right to be represented.\n\nFollowing the text\u2019s release, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement unloading on House Democrats, branding their impeachment probe a \u201csham.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House is barred from participating at all, until after Chairman Schiff conducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the judiciary committee. Even then, the White House\u2019s rights remain undefined, unclear and uncertain \u2014 because those rules still haven\u2019t been written,\u201d Grisham said.\n\nThe UPI contributed to this report.", "description": "Mitch McConnell slammed the House Democrats' impeachment proceedings resolution, stating it \"falls way short.\"", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1184227878-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
