(Justin Lane/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nOver the last eight years, JPMorgan Chase, the country\u2019s largest bank, has repeatedly resolved federal investigations by striking a deal: It wouldn\u2019t be prosecuted as long as it stayed out of trouble.\n\nAfter admitting to bid rigging in 2011, the bank signed a two-year non-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department. One year after the agreement lapsed, JPMorgan paid a $1.7 billion fine and settled felony charges for its part in Bernard Madoff\u2019s multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme and signed a two-year deferred prosecution agreement. About seven months before that agreement lapsed, the bank was in trouble with federal authorities again and pleaded guilty to allegedly conspiring to manipulate U.S. and foreign currency rates. It was put on three years probation.\n\nBut while still on probation, in 2016, JPMorgan Chase paid $72 million to settle charges for an alleged corrupt hiring scheme in China and entered into another non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe bank\u2019s winding road through the legal system reflects a shift in corporation prosecutions that began during the Clinton administration and has picked up steam, according to a report by Public Citizen. Since 1992, the Justice Department has entered 535 deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements with corporations, the progressive consumer advocacy group found. About 15 percent of those agreements went to companies that had already struck similar deals with federal prosecutors, the group found. Twelve companies were still on corporate probation when they signed another deferred prosecution or non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe giant German financier Deutsche Bank; Pfizer; HSBC; and Standard Charter have all entered into multiple deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements with the Justice Department, according to Public Citizen\u2019s research.\n\n\u201cWhen penalties for corporate violations are weak, corporate crime is not deterred \u2014 it\u2019s emboldened. And when corporate crime is emboldened, we all pay the price,\u201d said Rick Claypool, Public Citizen\u2019s research director, and author of the report.\n\nJPMorgan Chase said in a statement, \u201cWe continually strengthen our control functions, and we dedicate approximately one in five of our employees to these critical efforts.\u201d\n\nDeutsche Bank, Standard Charter and HSBC declined to comment. Pfizer didn\u2019t immediately provide a comment on the report.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson could not be reached for comment on this article.\n\nThis comes at a time when the Trump administration is prosecuting fewer white-collar crimes. The number of cases brought against corporations fell to 99 last year, compared with 181 in 2015, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Most were against small companies, 62.9 percent employed fewer than 50 workers, the report found.\n\n[As workplace raids multiply, Trump administration charges few companies]\n\nThe Justice Department has also begun emphasizing ways that companies can avoid harsh penalties, including announcing that those that invest in compliance programs would be rewarded. Then-deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein also announced a policy last year discouraging prosecutors from \u201cpiling on\u201d corporations by imposing multiple penalties for the same misconduct.\n\nDetermining how to best punish corporations \u201cis a tough problem,\u201d said Ellen Podgor, a Stetson University law professor who analyzes white-collar crime. \u201cHow do you get corporations in line, how do you stop them from misconduct?\u201d she said.\n\nOver the past few decades, Republican and Democratic administrations have increasingly leaned on deferred prosecution agreements, which must be approved by a judge, and non-prosecution agreements, which don\u2019t need court approval, to settle allegations against a corporation, legal experts say.\n\nBefore the mid-1990s, prosecutors most often used deferred prosecution agreements against individuals rather than corporations, said Nicolas Bourtin, a former federal prosecutor and managing partner at Sullivan & Cromwell\u2019s criminal defense and investigations group. In those cases, the charges were suspended, and if the individual stayed out of trouble and showed remorse, dropped, he said. They work largely the same for corporations.\n\n\u201cAt the end, the government moves to dismiss, and it\u2019s the functional equivalent of never being charged,\u201d Bourtin said.\n\n[\u2018We must do it\u2019: Deutsche Bank allegedly hired children of Russian, Chinese officials to win work]\n\nCritics have argued that the agreements have allowed corporations to escape the harsh penalties they deserve, including being forced to plead guilty in court. A guilty plea can come with a steeper cost, including reputation damage and, in some industries, being barred from receiving government contracts, they say.\n\nThe difference is largely symbolic, said Bourtin, from Sullivan & Cromwell. \u201cWith a guilty plea the company is branded a felon and has to deal with regulatory consequences that can be very damaging,\u201d he said.\n\nDeferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements are already onerous and often come with high penalties, corporate defense attorneys say. Companies may be required to make governance changes, enhance compliance systems or hire a court-approved monitor. If they violate the terms of the agreements, the government could move to prosecute for the criminal conduct it has already acknowledged as part of the agreement, defense attorneys say.\n\nBut Claypool, of Public Citizen, said that doesn\u2019t address the problem of repeat offenders who secure multiple agreements but continue to violate the law. \u201cThe extraordinary scale at which major corporations operate means their crimes can cause extraordinary harm,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when they do, they should not enjoy the privilege of extraordinary lenience.\u201d\n\nRepeat offenders should face escalating fines and consequences, said Podgor, of Stetson University. \u201cYou have to make the fine so that the cost to the company is not worth\u201d the bad behavior, she said.\n\nBut Bourtin said simply having multiple deferred prosecution or non-prosecution agreements doesn\u2019t mean a corporation hasn\u2019t learned its lesson. A company can be found criminally liable for the conduct of just one employee, and the agreements may reflect different types of criminal behavior by employees in separate divisions in far-flung parts of world, he said.\n\n\u201cRecidivism is a concept that doesn\u2019t apply to companies very well,\u201d Bourtin said.", "description": "This comes at a time when the Trump administration is prosecuting fewer white-collar crimes.
