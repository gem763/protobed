I had reconstruction on my left knee and my right knee was shattered.\n\n(Image: Daily Record WS)\n\n\"I have had multiple walking problems since.\n\n\"A couple of miles from the house I felt like lying down and dying.\"\n\nMr Lee says his knees were injured when he was knocked down and attacked in 2002 and claims he suffered a brain injury in the incident and still feels affects from that.\n\nHe also believes his recent heart attack and angina means he should have met the criteria for transport home.\n\nA spokesperson for NHS Forth Valley said: \"Like most hospitals in Scotland we do not routinely provide transport for patients attending our emergency department.\n\n\"We do have a freephone taxi booking service and the majority of local taxi firms are happy to take patients home and then arrange payment.\n\n\"The Scottish Ambulance Service also provides a patient transport service for individuals who meet the medical criteria for this service.\n\n\"We are sorry if these options were not discussed with the patient before they left the hospital and we would encourage them to contact our Patient Relations Department so that they can look into what happened and identify any changes or improvements, if required.\"", "description": "Paul Lee said he felt like \"lying down and dying\" a couple of miles from his house in Falkirk, Scotland", "authors": ["Brendan Mcfadden", "Julie Dunnett", "Image", "Daily Record Ws", "Daily Record"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20527389.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Paul-Lee.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
