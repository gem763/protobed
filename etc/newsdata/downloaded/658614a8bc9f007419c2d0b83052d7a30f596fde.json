A 24-team competition with at least eight European teams is planned to begin in June 2021, possibly in China.\n\nThough not fully testing Qatar\u2019s readiness for the four-week World Cup, this year\u2019s seven-team club competition will showcase some of the wealthy emirate\u2019s plans to welcome teams and fans.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s draw, the South American champions will enter the competition in the semifinals against African champion Esperance of Tunisia or the Asian champions.\n\nThe tournament opens on Dec. 11 with Hiengh\u00e8ne Sport from New Caledonia in the only first-round game. The Oceania champions will play either Qatar champion Al Sadd or the Asian Champions League runner-up if Al Sadd wins the continental title in November.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nine years after winning the right to host the 2022 World Cup, Qatar will get to show it can stage a FIFA soccer tournament when the Club World Cup goes to Doha.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Graham Dunbar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/britain_soccer_premier_league_53678_c0-153-2872-1827_s1770x1032.jpg?fb3b586ca128b3eeebf25d944dc134ca03896e46", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
