It wasn\u2019t on purpose, of course \u2014 Toliver was in the corner and Laimbeer was sitting on the bench \u2014 but if there was ever a metaphor for the Washington Mystics rediscovering their clutch gene in the face of a menacing opponent, this would do.\n\nMultiple Mystics players were clutch Tuesday night in front of 5,465 screaming spectators at Mandalay Bay Events Center. Toliver was, scoring 12 of her 20 points in the third quarter, and Emma Meesseman was, too, scoring 11 of her 22 points in just over two minutes in the fourth. Elena Delle Donne was clutch as well, leading her team with 25 points and executing the type of crucial defensive plays that helped earn her the league MVP award.\n\nWashington turned all that clutch into a Game 4 clinch Tuesday, defeating the Aces, 94-90, in a battle that felt worthy of the WNBA Finals, not the round before them.\n\n\u201cVegas is a phenomenal team,\u201d Mystics guard Natasha Cloud said. \u201cThey played us extremely well. It was incredible. They have great fans that come in, pack it, make it hard to play \u2014 these are the moments that you dream of playing in. This was a good series, and a great series for our league, too. It felt like a championship, which is good, because it prepares us for Connecticut.\u201d\n\nIt was Cloud who sealed the win with a free throw after Dearica Hamby\u2019s attempt at a game-tying three-pointer with five seconds left rolled around the rim and out. The top-seeded Mystics advance to their second consecutive WNBA Finals and will face the No. 2 seed Connecticut Sun, which finished a series sweep of the Los Angeles Sparks with a road win in this past Sunday\u2019s Game 3. Game 1 of the Finals is set for Sunday at Entertainment and Sports Arena.\n\n[In clash of contrasting superstars, Elena Delle Donne\u2019s poise carries Mystics to WNBA Finals]\n\nTo get past a gritty, proud Las Vegas team to get there, Washington needed to do the things that brought it success all season. The Mystics needed to move the ball well laterally and hit shots from the perimeter. On defense, they had to try their best to keep the ball from getting into 6-foot-8 center Liz Cambage\u2019s hands. They executed each of those things well for stretches, sometimes long stretches, of a highly competitive game, but the Aces imposed their will almost as frequently, Cambage fought back with 25 points, and the result was a heart-pounding playoff thriller that went down to the wire.\n\nThe difference was that Washington was just a hair sharper down the stretch.\n\nThe Mystics shot 47.4 percent from the field to the Aces\u2019 46.7 percent, and 43.3 percent from three to the Aces\u2019 41.2 percent. Las Vegas owned the rebounding edge 39-29, but Washington kept calm late in the fourth quarter even as the Aces got within one point with 17 seconds to go.\n\n\u201cWe talked about putting three stops together, because when we get stops, we can run, and we talked about just continuing to push the pace because at some point they\u2019re going to wear down,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cThey\u2019re big, so it\u2019s hard to run like that when you\u2019re big, especially when Liz was trying to score every possession on offense. We knew she was going to have to rest on defense, so we just wanted to continue to attack.\n\n\u201cSuper excited, happy, going to soak it in, enjoy it, because it\u2019s really hard to get back to the Finals. It\u2019s not easy to get back there, especially when everybody expects you to. So we really want to enjoy the moment.\u201d\n\nBoth teams jostled for control from the start.\n\nWashington started out shooting better than it did in Game 3, but the Mystics didn\u2019t get nearly as many good looks as they\u2019re used to: They put up just 17 shot attempts, two fewer than what they took in the first quarter Sunday. The Mystics shot just 41.2 percent and Las Vegas ended the quarter leading 26-17 \u2014 the first time the Aces led after the first period all series. It didn\u2019t last.\n\nWashington Coach-General Manager Mike Thibault threw a mix of offensive looks at the Aces in the second quarter to try to get Washington\u2019s offense into gear, including putting guard Shatori Walker-Kimbrough in with Aerial Powers, Delle Donne, Cloud and LaToya Sanders. What finally worked was Meesseman re-entering the fray.\n\n\u201cOffensively, our spacing was a little crowded [on Sunday],\u201d Walker-Kimbrough said. \u201cWhen we were able to space out, Emma got great looks, Delle got great looks, and they couldn\u2019t double-team. You\u2019ve kind of got to double the MVP, and they weren\u2019t able to do that. I\u2019ll take her against anybody.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Playoff Emma is having some fun!\u2019 Mystics\u2019 reserved Meesseman puts on a show.]\n\nMeesseman made the difference early in the fourth quarter, going off on her 11-point run in just over two minutes to put the Mystics up 83-76 with 6:34 to play. Cambage then got to the free throw line after a layup, and Hamby sealed a small burst that kept the Aces competitive, trailing just 83-80 with just under six minutes left.\n\nWhen Meeseman met Thibault in the hallway outside the locker room he pulled her in for a hug and said, \u201cSee what happens when you shoot?\u201d\n\nIn an excited but relatively calm locker room \u2014 Washington has done this before \u2014 the Mystics donned gray WNBA Finals ballcaps and took selfies with each other.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on track towards the goal that we wanted to achieve, and everybody worked really hard in the offseason and came into this season really focused,\u201d Toliver said. \u201cSo to be back where we wanted to be is special. But we want to make that next step. It just gets more exciting from here.\u201d", "description": "Washington outlasts Las Vegas, 94-90, and will host Connecticut in Game 1 of the Finals on Sunday.", "authors": ["Ava Wallace", "Reporter Covering Local Colleges", "September At Pm", "Ava Wallace Covers College Sports With A Focus On Georgetown", "Navy", "Maryland", "As Well As Tennis", "The Wnba For The Washington Post.
