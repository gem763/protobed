REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s dire picture on manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which rattled the market, investors await Thursday\u2019s ISM services report and Friday\u2019s employment report to confirm or quash recession worries.\n\nThey will also be looking for evidence on the strength of the consumer, which has been a cornerstone of the current economic expansion.\n\n\u201cI am more concerned at this point than I have been at any point in the entire year ... The key ingredient is when the business recession impacts the consumer and we get a total recession,\u201d said Phil Blancato, chief executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York.\n\nThe ISM came in at 47.8 on Tuesday, its lowest level in over 10-years as trade tensions weighed on exports.\n\nThat tipped the Dow .DJI and S&P 500 .SPX into their biggest one-day percentage declines since Aug. 23. The S&P 500 is now down 4.6% from its record July 26 closing high. A correction is traditionally defined as a 10% decline.\n\n\u201cThis one is significant. We\u2019re seeing a real contraction in the manufacturing sector,\u201d Blancato said.\n\n(GRAPHIC: U.S. Manufacturing hits 10-year low - here)\n\nWorries the drop in manufacturing was a harbinger of a sharper slowdown in the economy continued on Wednesday, as each of the major indexes closed down more than 1.5%. A report on private payrolls showed further slowing and did little to turn sentiment.\n\nExpectations for the ISM services report are for a reading of 55.0, down from the 56.4 registered in August. Friday\u2019s payrolls number is forecast to show job gains of 145,000, up from the 130,000 in August, while the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.7%.\n\nManufacturing represents a much smaller piece of the economic pie than the services sector. The concern though is that other data points, such as hours worked for the services sector, have indicated the slowdown may be escalating.\n\n\u201cWe are of course now watching non-manufacturing ISM and ultimately, most importantly, the nonfarm payrolls on Friday for the composition of how much of the deterioration we are seeing is only in manufacturing and are there any signs this is spreading to services,\u201d said Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.\n\n\u201cThe worry we have is the uncertainties associated with all this will continue to argue for having a much more cautious approach as an investor at the moment.\u201d\n\nAside from the recessionary worries, October is a historically volatile month for stocks, said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nAccording to Detrick, no month has had more single days moves of 1% in either direction since 1950 than October. Since 1928, six of the 10 biggest single-day drops have come during the month, while three of the 10 best one-day performances have also occurred in October.\n\n\u201cIt is almost a function of the fact that last month was so dull, then you get the disappointing ISM number and everyone kind of freaks out real fast and that is what has led to this two-day, very quick gyration lower as we were kind of lulled almost to sleep by the lack of volatility in September,\u201d said Detrick.\n\nDetrick also pointed to other periods during the current bull market where the manufacturing number fell below 50, the threshold between expansion and contraction, and managed to bounce back as reason for optimism.\n\nHowever, an ISM contraction does not necessarily signal long-term market losses.\n\nChris Ciovacco, CEO at Ciovacco Capital Management in Atlanta, Georgia, said there were at least five instances where the manufacturing number registered above 60 and subsequently fell to Tuesday\u2019s 47.8 reading going back to 1982. In four of those cases, the S&P 500 was higher after the first two years. The index was also higher in each case after four and five years.\n\n\u201cObviously weak manufacturing does have a correlation with recessions and that is something you have to respect, it shouldn\u2019t just be written off or ignored,\u201d Ciovacco said.", "description": "A wake-up call from the U.S. heartland has spooked Wall Street by raising fears of a recession that will push equities into a correction.", "authors": ["Chuck Mikolajczak", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436546288&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9208Z"}
