Ted Cruz \u2014 pressing for the U.S. to index capital gains to inflation\n\n\u201cAn idea liked by many?\u201d Trump added on top of the tweet.\n\nIn the op-ed, Cruz and co-author conservative economist Grover Norquist argue that eliminating the so-called inflation tax would help keep the 11-year economic expansion afloat.\n\n\u201cOver the longer term, a capital gains tax cut spurs the growth of new businesses, increases the wages of workers, enhances consumer purchasing power, and grows the economy at large, resulting in more overall gains to be taxed,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe agree, and we urge the administration to do just that.\u201d\n\nMoments later, Trump shared a second tweet from Club for Growth, a conservative organization that\u2019s focused on cutting taxes, calling on him to index capital gains to inflation.\n\nA capital gain is the profit from the sale of stock or real estate; indexing capital gains would lower tax bills for investors who are selling by adjusting the original purchase price of the item in line with inflation.\n\nFor instance, if an individual purchased a share for $100 in 2000 and sold that item 18 years later for $200, the nominal capital gain would be $100, according to the Tax Foundation. But inflation over that same time period would have increased the price level by 49 percent. Under an indexing proposal, the original selling price would increase to $149 \u2014 meaning the individual would only pay tax on $51, instead of the full $100.\n\nTrump flirted with lowering capital-gains taxes by indexing gains to inflation last week after a flurry of worrisome economic activity, including the inversion of the spread between two-month and 10-year Treasury yields, an occurrence that\u2019s historically preceded recessions.\n\n\u201cIndexing is something that a lot of people have liked for a long time,\u201d Trump said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s something that would be very easy to do. It\u2019s something that I am certainly thinking about.\u201d\n\nHowever, he backed away from the measure one day later.\n\n\u201cIndexing is better support for upper-income groups,\u201d Trump told reporters outside the White House last Wednesday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nIndexing capital gains taxes would do very little to actually spur economic growth, according to the Tax Foundation. Only the top 1 percent of taxpayers would see their after-tax income increase with an increase of 0.83 percent.", "description": "\u201cAn idea liked by many?\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet Friday morning.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/AP19227762822992.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
