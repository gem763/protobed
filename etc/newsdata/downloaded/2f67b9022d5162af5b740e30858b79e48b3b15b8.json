None of you has ever met but in a moment you will be required to cooperate, adjudicate fairness, coordinate timing and agree on the right of way, even if, you know, some parties aren\u2019t feeling it. How will you comport yourself, citizen?\n\nDriving is a social-cultural behavior, with its own code, norms and taboos, all strongly regional in character. I\u2019m writing this from Germany, a nation with a proud ethos of strict rule-keeping; it is only the observance of said rules that permits safe high-speed driving. For example, in both nations, slower traffic is required to move to the right, with passing permitted only on the left. If you hang out in the passing lane on the Autobahn you can quickly find yourself in the crosshairs of a car going 100-plus mph, flashing headlamps with the left turn signal on. These are subtle cues to indicate you are driving like an ass. You can also be pulled over for unsafe driving by grim-faced polizei.\n\nWhereas, in many parts of the U.S., the code is more nuanced. Here the passing lane is what theorists would call a site of contestation. Some drivers deputize themselves to slow traffic down to their comfort level\u2014\u201cThey can just go around!\u201d said my mother, God rest her. Others think the left lane is territory to be possessed and protected, regardless of what they\u2019re driving or how fast.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What is the most frustrating thing (but that you would never do yourself) you regularly see other drivers do?\n\nAnd some drivers are just agents of chaos. For them the left lane is a skirmish line in a larger battle of grudges. Damn Toyota Prius drivers.\n\nHowever they justify this behavior, Americans cannot claim ignorance. The rules of left-lane passing are thoroughly covered in driver\u2019s ed, on driver\u2019s license exams, and printed on zillions of highways signs that say \u201cslower traffic keep right.\u201d\n\nI am talking about a small minority of drivers. By my estimate, only about 1 in 10 American drivers are oblivious, demented, incontinent with rage or obsessed with never being passed. I think we all know a certain someone like that. The rest of us are gentle souls who just want to get to work on time.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about merging: Notionally, it\u2019s simple, with vehicles in two lanes meshing like the teeth of a zipper to form one line. In the case of cars joining the flow of freeway traffic, through-traffic has the right of way, regardless. Drivers aren\u2019t legally obligated to make room by moving left, if room is needed, but courteous, well-meaning people will.\n\nLesson No. 1: If you are the through-traffic, go out of your way to give way.\n\nBut let\u2019s say you are driving in dense city traffic, where it\u2019s a good bet everybody is in a hurry to be anywhere but where they are. Ahead of you, your lane is blocked\u2014a double-parked limousine, a trash truck, whatever. In this case, through-traffic again has the right of way but these drivers also have the option to yield, for one car apiece, so that all who share the road get through. Cue the friendly wave.\n\nLesson No. 2: Cooperate. Humans, ants and bees are all eusocial species. Act like it. Your investment in the hive is well worth it.\n\nThere are institutional contributors to messy merging: our various departments of transportation. Imagine you are on a two-lane divided highway, where repair crews are working on the road, requiring a lane closure. The crews will typically lay out caution signs for a mile or more advising drivers \u201clane closed, merge left (or right).\u201d But when people start to see these signs a certain percentage will get antsy and start nosing into the other lane of traffic prematurely, slowing both lanes down, jamming the zipper instead of waiting for the merging zone, which may or may not be marked.\n\nLesson No. 3: Zippers have only one slide, one point of meshing. Maintain lane discipline until you reach the lane closure, and then with the help of your fellow drivers, left-right alternate. From the through-traffic, a flash of the headlamps indicates \u201cI see you; go for it.\u201d Do not rely on hand signals, unless you speak sign language.\n\nBut of course people stop, slow down, hesitate, miss their moment. In an A.I.-assisted driving universe, vehicles would mesh with the lubricious certainty of ZF gearboxes. But for now, wishing for autonomous solutions feels like wishing for a pony. It falls to we citizens of the road to educate and enforce, by way of group censure, driving manners.\n\nSo yes, if you must wedge in early, no one will stop you. Sure, you can leave people to pound sand as you motor by like you didn\u2019t see. But you deserve the most pungent of stink eye. Your spouse is going to be exasperated with you (not for the first time, I\u2019m sure) and you are going to feel bad later, God willing.\n\nThis is my theme, this is my cause. The only way poor driving can be discouraged is by the force of manners, the sting of taboo, and the normalizing of nice. That means heaping scorn on people who drive antisocially.
