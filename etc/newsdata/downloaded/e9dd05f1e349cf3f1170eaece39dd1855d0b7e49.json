It\u2019s been a busier than normal holiday period.\u201d\n\nJapanese visitors and Australians on driving holidays were most likely to want to scale Uluru, Schwer said, though he urged them not to do so.\n\nAustralian tourist Belinda Moore, 33, drove to Uluru from her home in central Queensland state to ascend the rock, an experience she said she \u201cabsolutely loved\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been something to tick off the bucket list and when we heard it was closing, we knew it was now or never,\u201d she told AFP.\n\nMoore said she did not think her climb was disrespectful to traditional owners as she was not Aboriginal.\n\n\u201cIt may be for their own people, because it\u2019s their sacred site,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sad that they\u2019re closing it, but it\u2019s still amazing just to see it. I would still recommend it.\u201d\n\nThe climb will be permanently closed as of October 26, the anniversary of ownership being handed back to the Anangu people.\n\nUluru has great spiritual and cultural significance to indigenous Australians, with their connection to the site dating back tens of thousands of years.\n\nThough visitor numbers were expected to decline once the ban was in place, Schwer said local tourism operators were \u201cnot particularly concerned\u201d as it would return the area to normality.\n\n\u201cPeople need to remember that in central Australia we\u2019re a very interconnected community,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who are requesting the climb closure are our friends and colleagues.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just looking forward to being able to have the climb consigned to the annals of history.\u201d", "description": "Sydney (AFP) \u2013 Large numbers of tourists are rushing to scale Uluru \u2014 also known as Ayers Rock \u2014 ahead of a looming ban on climbing a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/05a899_uluru-as-ayers-rock-is-large-sandstone-rock-formation-world-biggest-monolith-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
