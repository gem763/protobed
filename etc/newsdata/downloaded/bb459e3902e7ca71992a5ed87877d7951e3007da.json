(Tom McCorkle/for The Washington Post)\n\nA Rhone Valley \u201ccru\u201d wine under $20 is a rare find, so this week\u2019s greatest value is the Brotte Cru des C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne from the village of Cairanne. We also have two affordable malbecs \u2014 one from Argentina, the other from Cahors in southwestern France. For whites, try a rich, splurge-worthy sauvignon blanc from Sancerre or a racy txakoli from Spain\u2019s Basque country.\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nBrotte de P\u00e8re en Fils, Cru des C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne\n\nCairanne, Rhone Valley, France, $14\n\nCairanne is one of the villages in the Rhone Valley that has earned its own appellation because of the quality of its wines. They usually cost more than $20, so this beauty is a terrific bargain. Think textbook Rhone red \u2014 hints of dark cherries, violets and wild herbs. Pair it with any red meat dishes \u2014 grilled, braised or roasted. Alcohol by volume: 14 percent.\n\nImported and distributed by M.

As 2018 was a warm, ripe vintage, this wine shows more tree fruit character and round, rich mouthfeel, rather than the slightly aggressive or stony mineral profile sauvignon blanc has in more classic years. Enjoy this for its ripeness and exuberance, with broiled fish or roast chicken. ABV: 13 percent.\n\nImported and distributed by Elite: Available in the District at MacArthur Beverages, Paul\u2019s of Chevy Chase, Rodman\u2019s, Whole Foods Market (P Street).

Serve it with seafood salad, grilled or broiled shrimp, sardines, scallops, oysters, anything with anchovies . . . well, you get the idea!

Available in Virginia at Arrowine and Cheese in Arlington, Chain Bridge Cellars in McLean.\n\nC\u00e8dre Heritage Malbec 2016\n\nCahors, France, $15\n\nArgentina built its reputation for fine reds on the malbec grape in the 1990s, sparking a friendly rivalry with Cahors, in southwestern France, where the grape has thrived for generations. The C\u00e8dre Heritage is typical for the region: brawny and rustic, with meaty flavors and an almost chewy texture.
