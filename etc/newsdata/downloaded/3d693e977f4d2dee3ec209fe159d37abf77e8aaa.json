Since then, the president has cycled through several rationales, justifications and counter-attacks on Twitter and in public remarks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut his approach lacks consistency and discipline, and Republican insiders are sounding the alarm.\n\n\u201cThere is growing concern. We are almost a month into this and there is still no White House strategy,\u201d said Alex Conant, a longtime GOP strategist who was communications director for Sen.

But it is not surprising because that has been a problem with this administration since the very beginning.\u201d\n\nThe president, combative and mercurial as ever, has lashed out almost daily since details of the call with Zelensky emerged. On the call, Trump encouraged his Ukrainian opposite number to investigate 2020 Democratic front-runner Joe Biden Joe BidenA dozen House Democrats call on EU ambassador to resign amid Ukraine scandal Ex-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown MORE and his son, Hunter.\n\nAmong Trump\u2019s arguments: The call was \u201cperfect;\u201d Democrats are engaged in another \u201cwitch hunt;\u201d Democrats want a \u201ccoup;\u201d Trump offered Zelensky no quid pro quo; removing Trump from office could fracture the nation like the Civil War; the allegations are \u201cbullshit.\u201d\n\nThose arguments are largely subjective but the president has also thrown out some factual assertions that are dubious at best.\n\nHe has repeatedly attacked the reliability of the whistleblower whose allegations began the saga, despite the fact that records released by the White House comport with the whistleblower\u2019s allegations regarding the Zelensky call.\n\nRepublicans outside of a cadre of hardcore Trump loyalists have been reluctant to appear before the television cameras to defend him. The party\u2019s cold feet in that regard have not been helped by two high-profile TV interviews that were widely considered to have gone badly for senior Republicans.\n\nOn an episode of CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d broadcast on Sep. 29, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthyHouse GOP touts poll showing impeachment advantage for Republicans Trump told Republicans he doesn't want impeachment on his 'resume': report Trump holds call with House GOP amid impeachment inquiry MORE (R-Calif.) incorrectly suggested reporter Scott Pelley had misrepresented a portion of the Trump-Zelensky call.\n\nAn appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday by Sen.

Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyTrump defends Syria move: 'It's time to come back home' GOP senator: 'Not appropriate' to ask foreign governments to investigate Biden Senators call for Trump administration to testify on Syria MORE (R-Utah), the GOP\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, has been the most prominent Republican critic. He has been on the receiving end of a number of angry Trump tweets in response, including one branding him a \u201cpompous ass.\u201d\n\nBut if Republicans are loathe to come out in explicit opposition to the president, any attempts to defend him are complicated because of Trump\u2019s volatile approach and the fear of what else might yet emerge.\n\nReferring to the president\u2019s tendency to react to what he sees on cable news, Judy said, \u201cThe administration\u2019s line one day might not be the administration\u2019s line after \u2018Hannity\u2019 the same night, much less the next day. So it\u2019s a hard place, a dangerous place, for defenders of the president to be.\u201d\n\nCongressional Republicans have also sometimes founded their defense on different grounds than the president. Last week, after Trump suggested that China should also investigate the Bidens, Rubio argued that the president had not been serious.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a real request or him just needling the press,\u201d Rubio told a reporter at a news conference.\n\nThere was no obvious indication that Trump was joking, nor has he himself said he was. Yet Rubio\u2019s description was later echoed by a handful of other Republicans.\n\nOn Monday, an unrelated controversy sharpened the tensions between Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe president\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria just as Turkey was set to begin a military operation in the north of the country was widely derided. Even strong Trump supporters such as Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamSusan Rice calls Trump decision to pull troops from Syria 'batshit crazy' Pat Robertson 'absolutely appalled' by Trump's Syria announcement Overnight Defense: Republicans urge Trump to reverse course on Syria | Dems subpoena Pentagon in impeachment probe | North Korea talks falter MORE (R-S.C.) were critical.\n\nSome voices that remain supportive of the president argue that the media is over-hyping the dangers in which he finds himself.\n\nBarry Bennett, who was a senior adviser on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, said of impeachment: \u201cHalf the country sees this as a brazen partisan attack, and the other half of the country is cheering on the brazen partisan attack. I find it very hard to believe there are still undecided people.\u201d\n\nBennett also argued that there was no immediate sign of a dip in Trump\u2019s overall approval rating in opinion polls \u2014 something that he said showed the White House\u2019s pushback had been \u201ceffective\u201d so far.\n\nEven Bennett had some reservations, however.\n\n\u201cI would love to see something bigger,\u201d he said. \u201cI would love to see more strategy.\u201d\n\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.", "description": "Republican discontent is deepening about the lack of a single, direct message from the White House aimed at blunting the Democratic push for President Trump\u2019s impeachment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/memo_trumpimpeachmentdefense_100719hillillustration.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
