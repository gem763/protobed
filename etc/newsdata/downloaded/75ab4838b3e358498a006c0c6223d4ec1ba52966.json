(House of Commons via AP)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Brexit (all times local):\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nThe European Union says it is up to the U.K. government to tell the 27 EU member states \"as soon as possible\" what action it will take after the Brexit deal was not voted on Saturday.\n\nEU Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said the EU executive took note of the vote and did not suggest a course of action.\n\n\"It will be for the UK government to inform us about the next steps as soon as possible,\" she said on Twitter.\n\nHad the deal been approved, the EU parliament had planned to back the Brexit deal by Thursday evening.\n\n___\n\n3 p.m.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he will push ahead and try to leave European Union by Oct. 31.\n\nHe said Saturday he is not daunted or dismayed by a vote delaying approval of the new Brexit deal, and said there will be no new negotiations with the EU.\n\nHe says he still believes he can command \"overwhelming\" support for the new Brexit divorce plan and will introduce the required legislation to make that happen.\n\nJohnson says he is not compelled by the law to negotiate any further with the EU.\n\n___\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nBritish lawmakers have voted to postpone a decision on whether to back a Brexit deal with the European Union, throwing a wrench into government plans to leave the bloc at the end of this month.\n\nAt a special session of Parliament intended to ratify the deal, lawmakers instead voted 322-306 to withhold their approval until legislation to implement the agreement has been passed.\n\nThe vote is a major blow to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and means he has to ask the EU to delay Britain's departure. Parliament previously passed a law compelling him to do that if a deal had not been passed by Saturday.\n\nThe move is intended to ensure the U.K. can't crash out of the EU without a deal on the scheduled Oct. 31 departure date.\n\nThe government still hopes it can pass the needed legislation by the end of the month so the U.K. can leave on time.\n\n___\n\n1:40 p.m.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Theresa May, whose Brexit deal was rejected by Parliament three times, says she is backing the agreement struck by her successor Boris Johnson.\n\nMay told lawmakers she had a \"distinct sense of deja vu\" as Parliament debated whether to back Johnson's EU divorce deal. She resigned in frustration after lawmakers repeatedly threw out her Brexit agreement.\n\nJohnson's deal is similar to May's in some ways but contains a different arrangement for maintaining an open Irish border.\n\nMay said Parliament should pass the deal and let Britain leave the EU on Oct. 31. She said \"people want certainty in their lives. . If you want this country to move forward then vote for the deal today.\"\n\n___\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nTens of thousands of anti-Brexit protesters are marching through London as lawmakers debate Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new European Union divorce deal.\n\nProtesters, many wearing blue berets emblazoned with yellow stars symbolizing the EU flag, poured out of subway trains and buses for the march to Parliament Square on Saturday.\n\nIn one side street, a group of demonstrators with bells strapped to their legs and wielding sticks performed a traditional English morris dance and chanted: \"Morris, not Boris!\" to cheers from onlookers.\n\nOne of the dancers, Kate Fisher, says \"demos that are fun and joyful are more effective.\"\n\nElsewhere, the mood was less cheerful.\n\nSarah Spoor, who cares for her two children with disabilities, choked back tears as she said she is \"distraught\" at the prospect of Britain leaving the EU.\n\n___\n\n11:50 a.m.\n\nThousands of Brexit opponents are gathering in central London to call for Britain to remain part of the European Union.\n\nThe crowds are planning to converge on Parliament Square as legislators are voting on Brexit departure plans put forth by Conservative British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nMany carried signs calling for a halt to the Brexit process that started with a 2016 referendum in which British voters narrowly backed taking Britain out of the 28-nation bloc.\n\nProtester Bruce Nicole, a vicar from Camberley southwest of London, said the Brexit deal would harm Britain.\n\nHe says \"I fervently believe that we should remain in the EU.\" He adds \"I am British but I am also European. I don't believe the current deal offers any benefits at all.\"\n\n___\n\n10 a.m.\n\nOpposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has told Parliament that the Brexit deal on which lawmakers are voting risks jobs, rights, the environment and the health service.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he will push ahead and try to leave European Union by Oct. 31.
