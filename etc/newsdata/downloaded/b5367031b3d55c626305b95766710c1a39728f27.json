The stock market has kept investors busy in 2019, with an on-and-off trade war, the Federal Reserve in the spotlight, inverted yield curves, and significant volatility.\n\nAmid all that chaos, the S&P 500 index is up 18% in 2019 through last week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 15% and the Nasdaq Composite is up 21%.\n\nHere are the five top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 so far this year.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill stock (CMG) is the king of the S&P 500 in terms of 2019 gains. The shares are up 94% until Labor Day. What\u2019s even more impressive is that the stock didn\u2019t lose much value in the late-2018 market selloff, which created room for some stocks to regain market cap when things calmed down in January.\n\nChipotle has thrived amid strong gains for restaurants in general, but analyst optimism and strong earnings have helped put the stock on top.\n\nMarketAxess Holdings\n\nMarketAxess Holdings (MKTX) is an electronic bond-trading platform. Sustained focus on the Federal Reserve\u2014and whether, when, and how much it would cut interest rates\u2014has meant lots of action for the bond market. MarketAxess stock has benefitted, up 89% so far in 2019.\n\n\ufeff Tyson Foods\n\nTyson Foods stock (TSN) is up 77% year to date. The company\u2019s earnings have been solid, and swine flu in China stands to raise meat prices (millions of pigs were culled because of it). The stock touched a record high in August, after analysts raved about the company\u2019s full-year earnings outlook.\n\nBall Corp.\n\nBall Corp. (BLL), the maker of glass jars, lids, and other home canning products, has seen huge gains in 2019. Oscar Schafer, chairman of the New York-based hedge fund Rivulet Capital, picked the stock at this year\u2019s Barron\u2019s Roundtable. He said in a July follow-up interview that \u201caluminum cans continue to take share from plastic containers as consumers prioritize sustainability.\u201d\n\nThe stock is up 76% year to date.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices stock (AMD) has mostly recovered from a dip late last year. The stock is up 70% year-to-date. Barron\u2019s wrote in December that AMD could be the biggest winner in cloud computing chips. And we named chief executive Lisa Su to our 2019 list of the World\u2019s Best CEOs.\n\nWrite to Connor Smith at connor.smith@barrons.com", "description": "The stock market has kept investors busy in 2019, with an on-and-off trade war, the Federal Reserve in the spotlight, inverted yield curves, and significant volatility.
