According to creators, around 5.7 million children under the age of 11 live in a home with a parent with substance abuse issues and one in three of those kids will enter foster care due to parental addiction, a number that has grown by more than 50% in the past decade.\n\nAccording to The Guardian , the empathetic minds working behind-the-scenes at Sesame Street heard those numbers and realized that there were a lot of kids that could use a new relatable friend.\n\nKarli was first introduced in May 2019 as the face of the Sesame Street in Communities foster care initiative. They decided to expand Karli\u2019s storyline to explain that she was placed in foster care when her mother went away for treatment for addiction and she is now in recovery.
