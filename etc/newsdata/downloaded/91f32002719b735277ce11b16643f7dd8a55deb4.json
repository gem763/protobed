I hope that it hasn\u2019t touched your life, or your home, but the truth is that it\u2019s affecting more and more people. In 2015, nearly 15,000 Americans died from an overdose on a prescription opioid like Oxycodone or Hydrocodone. The numbers today are almost certainly worse. And, tragically, these deaths are even more avoidable than you\u2019d think. That\u2019s because overprescribing opioids in America\u2019s doctor\u2019s offices and, especially, emergency rooms has gotten a lot of people hooked on these\n\nWhy Is This A Problem Today?\n\ndangerous drugs . Luckily, there are some very easy steps you can take to ensure you don\u2019t wind up part of this sad story. And there are some very safe, effective ways to successfully treat pain, without the risk of opioid addiction, or overdose.You\u2019d think that we\u2019d have learned our lesson by now. Opioids\u2014a class of painkilling drugs including both legal and illegal drugs, like oxycodone and heroin\u2014are exceptionally dangerous. If I had my way, we\u2019d get rid of the lot of them. Except in very rare circumstances\u2014like terminal cancer patients\u2014I never prescribe them to anyone that comes to see me. However, while they are very dangerous, they are a highly effective way to treat pain. All pain. And that\u2019s the rub. The best way to treat pain is to find out what\u2019s causing it, get to the root source, and then give a highly personalized solution. I have a number of pain solutions that I like to use, and each does a great job treating different kinds of pain. But it takes time to diagnose and figure out the best possible approach. And if you\u2019re dealing with an emergency\u2014like in an emergency room\u2014doctors often don\u2019t have that time. That\u2019s why emergency rooms are where a lot of opioid addictions start. A patient goes in with an acute problem, and the doctor gives them a very limited dose of opioids to tide them over. However, opioid addiction can develop very fast\u2014in as little as a week. So even just a week\u2019s worth of pills can lead to addiction problems. And worse, when a patient follows up with their primary care physician, something called clinical inertia has a tendency to take over. Basically, if you still have the same complaints, one physician will just continue the treatment of the previous one. Which, in the case of opioids, can lead to some very bad outcomes. While this downstream risk is great, we\u2019ve recently seen progress in diagnosing the upstream risk, caused by the initial prescription. A new research study found that there\u2019s huge variance in how often different doctors prescribe opioids. The lowest-prescribing quartile of emergency room physicians only prescribed opioids in about 7% of cases. But the highest-prescribing quartile gave them to 24% of patients\u2014more than three times as often. Unsurprisingly, patients who saw the highest-prescribing quarter of ER doctors wound up with higher incidents of opioid addiction. 30% higher, to be exact. Part of the problem is that there\u2019s no clear set of guidelines for when prescribing opioids is considered good or bad practice. Right now, doctors and researchers are trying to figure that out. But, in the meantime, you\u2019ve got to navigate the world as it currently stands. And it\u2019s a world awash in opioids.\n\nPain Management Options\n\nThe best way to avoid opioid addiction is to avoid opioids altogether. That means seeking out alternatives. Lots of people like ibuprofen\u2014and there\u2019s no doubt, it\u2019s an effective pain treatment, and much safer than opioids. But that doesn\u2019t mean ibuprofen is entirely safe. Indeed, it can cause kidney problems or bleeding. It\u2019s not a perfect cure. Aspirin causes other problems, like liver damage. However, white willow bark contains salicin\u2014the chemical precursor to aspirin. It is much safer, and milder, yet many studies show it\u2019s just as effective a pain reliever. Especially for headaches, lower back pain, and osteoarthritis. It doesn\u2019t work well with everyone, though, so if you have diabetes, gout, kidney or liver issues, you should avoid white willow bark. For everyone else, it makes sense to consult your doctor and let him or her know what you\u2019re taking. But in most cases\u2014especially if you aren\u2019t taking it regularly\u2014500 mg of willow bark will relieve most headaches, pains and strains. Another great option for pain relief, if your pain is related to inflammation, is curcumin. Curcumin is one of the best solutions for inflammation around, and it can strongly counteract any inflammatory pain. That includes injuries. Normally, a dose of curcumin is 500 mg. But I suggest going with a high dose for pain relief\u2014taking 2-4 regular doses, twice a day. Because curcumin is so safe, you don\u2019t need to worry about taking too much. The same goes for essential fatty acids, like omega-3. I once had an elderly but active patient complain to me about knee pain. He took high doses of omega-3s, and within half a week his pain was completely gone\u2014he was playing racquetball again. The normal dose of omega-3 is 500 mg, but you should take 2-4 times that amount, twice a day, when you\u2019re taking it for pain. Finally,\n\nDealing With The Last Resort\n\nif you\u2019re dealing with a muscle or general pain, a 20-minute bath, with two cups of Epsom salt and a cup of baking soda dissolved in it, can do wonders. I had a patient suffering from lymphoma. He was in horrible pain\u2014but a few days later, after bathing with Epsom salt, his comfort had improved outrageously. I\u2019m tempted to say he did even better with the Epsom salt than he would have with opioids. And, since Epsom salt is entirely safe, there\u2019s no danger whatsoever.Odds are good that, even if you\u2019re managing whatever pain you have well, you\u2019re going to run into opioids at some point. Whether you go to the ER with an injury, you have acute pain from an illness like kidney stones, or you\u2019re recovering from surgery, you may, one day, have to face opioids. The first thing you should do is ask if they\u2019re absolutely necessary . In some cases, your doctor may be able to find a suitable alternative. But in other cases, you might not be given a choice. The key in those instances is to get off the opioids as soon as possible. Ask for a small prescription, and as soon as you have a follow-up, ask for an alternative to opioids. It may sound silly. You may think that opioids will never wind up causing you the problems that they cause for others. But trust me\u2014everyone is susceptible. These are highly addictive, highly dangerous drugs. Don\u2019t take the risk\u2014avoid them whenever you can, and get them out of the your system as fast as possible when you can\u2019t. Don\u2019t take a chance here. Opioids are simply too dangerous. And there are too many great, safe alternatives you can use instead.\n\nReferences", "description": "We\u2019re dealing with an opioid epidemic in America today.
