For its third quarter, Scotiabank also reported $2.2 billion in revenue from the Pacific Alliance, up 26 per cent from the same period a year earlier and 29 per cent of total bank revenue.\n\n\u201cWhile the near-term outlook differs among the four countries (we are particularly concerned about macroeconomic challenges in Mexico and ongoing protests in Chile that began this past Friday), we continue to see strong upside growth potential for BNS (Scotiabank) in what remains an under-banked developing market,\u201d analysts from Credit Suisse wrote on Monday.\n\nHowever, the Pacific Alliance countries have recently been hit by some economic, social and political problems. For instance, the metro fare-hike has been suspended in Chile, but the dispute has reportedly spread to broader concerns about rising living costs and inequality.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, the Canadian government was warning travellers to exercise \u201ca high degree of caution\u201d in Santiago and several other areas of Chile where the state of emergency is in effect.\n\n\u201cIncidents of violence have occurred, including arson and looting,\u201d the government noted. \u201cSome have led to deaths and injuries.\u201d\n\nPeru, meanwhile, has recently been faced with a constitutional crisis and Colombia was recently jolted by a former commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces vowing to resume fighting following a 2016 peace deal between the group and the government.\n\nMexico has seen a spike in violence and slower economic growth of late. The latter helped prompt Mexico\u2019s central bank to cut interest rates, which can put pressure on a bank\u2019s net interest margin, the measure of the difference between what it charges for loans and pays out savers.\n\n\u201cWith several interest rate cuts by the central bank expected through 2020, we believe Mexico could be a modest drag for BNS in the near-term as net interest margins compress,\u201d the Credit Suisse analysts wrote. \u201cRecent developments in (Chile) are concerning, although we believe any short-term setback is manageable as even a severe 15 per cent to 20 per cent earnings hit for BNS in Chile would impact (earnings per share) by only approximately 1 per cent.\u201d\n\nScotiabank\u2019s spokesperson noted they had been operating in the Pacific Alliance countries for more than 20 years.\n\n\u201cThese markets are highly-resilient to political and economic cycles, with strong macroeconomic fundamentals,\u201d they added.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne", "description": "Eleven people have died and about 1,500 have been arrested since the protests, sparked by a hike to subway fares, began on Friday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/scotiabank.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
