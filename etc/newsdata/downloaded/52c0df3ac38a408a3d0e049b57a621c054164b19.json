He failed.\n\nThe main controversy centers on his $50,000-a-month position on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company that\u2019s been under investigation for corruption for a decade, on and off.\n\nWhy did it bring on a 44-year-old lawyer who had no experience with Ukraine or natural gas \u2014 but happened to be the son of the US vice president who was serving as administration point man on Ukraine?\n\n\u201cI think I had as much experience as anybody else on the board \u2026 if not more,\u201d Hunter told ABC News.\n\nBut \u2014 asked outright: \u201cIf your name was not Biden, do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma?\u201d \u2014 he didn\u2019t dare deny the obvious: \u201cProbably not,\u201d he replied.\n\nIndeed, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things in my life that wouldn\u2019t have happened if my name wasn\u2019t Biden.\u201d That would plainly include his even more lucrative luck in doing business in China \u2014 another country for which father Joe had point. Heck, Hunter\u2019s first big job was with MBNA America, a Delaware bank holding company that was one of Joe\u2019s top campaign donors.\n\nHunter insists he never sold access to his father \u2014 as if the name alone weren\u2019t a promise of influence.\n\nBut the only \u201cpoor judgment\u201d Hunter admits to was that he \u201cdidn\u2019t take into account\u201d the chance \u201cthat there would be a Rudy Giuliani or a president of the United States who would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea\u201d \u2014 namely, suspicions about Joe\u2019s publicly admitted role in the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was probing Burisma.\n\nHe never figured anyone would look into it. How many other influence peddlers could make the same pathetic excuse?", "description": "The main controversy centers on his $50,000-a-month position on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company that\u2019s been under investigation for corruption for a decade, on and off.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/biden_gma2-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
