We would love to be in that position and to have that disposable income.\n\n\"I wish I could spend money like that because it would make such a difference to the kids.\"\n\n(Image: KALEL PRODUCTIONS)\n\nAfter a bad night's sleep for Hattie, who would \"rather be in a bed in a hotel\", it's breakfast cooked on the embers of last night's fire and a morning of free activities.\n\nThe family visit the farm on the campsite and while Chloe loves the animals, Kadie's autism means she struggles with the unfamiliar surroundings.\n\nAlthough the two children are both loving having outside space to play in and are learning to ride their bikes.\n\nThe Hayward's live in a flat with no outside space and on a busy road, which makes playing out difficult.\n\nAfter a \u00a315 picnic for lunch, the family have spent \u00a317.50 of their daily \u00a340 budget and task Hattie with spending the remaining \u00a322.50 on picking an activity for the afternoon and buying food for their evening meal.\n\n(Image: KALEL PRODUCTIONS)\n\n(Image: KALEL PRODUCTIONS)\n\n(Image: KALEL PRODUCTIONS)\n\nNever having had to budget before, Hattie is shocked at the price of activities, and opts for a book to enable to children to go on a wildlife hunt in the woods.\n\nIt's a huge success and posh girl Hattie finally starts to remember her own love of nature and the outdoors.\n\nFor their evening meal she has chosen sausages, rice and a bizarre mix of baked beans and sweetcorn - but it's still a hit with the Hayward's.\n\nAfter dinner, which Hattie cooks herself on an open fire, mum Louise admits their financial situation means it can be difficult to plan activities specially tailored for Kadie and her autism.\n\nHattie is stunned, saying: \"I had knee problems when I was younger and needed some surgery, which my dad just sorted out for me.\n\n(Image: KALEL PRODUCTIONS)\n\n(Image: KALEL PRODUCTIONS)\n\n\"It's hard to realise that money can have an impact on someone's development - but it can.\"\n\nHattie also admits her parents were keen for her to swap her lavish lifestyle for this holiday as they are both from working class families.\n\nHattie's father started his own business and this is how he made his fortune - and her revelation gives Pete food for thought.\n\nHe says: \"I know there's more I could do for my family. Listening to how your parents grew up has inspired me to better myself.\"\n\nAfter a bought breakfast and a morning of free fruit picking on the farm, Hattie has a treat for the family.\n\nShe has organised a day with horses at a centre that specialises for people with autism - and the girls love it.\n\nAfter enlisting Pete to help her take down her tent, Hattie's experience of holidays on a budget has come to an end - but the 19-year-old had learned an important lesson.\n\nShe says: \"I need to stop spending money on stuff thatI just want and I don't need.\n\n\"I would just chuck money around like it was nothing but seeing how much they struggle, it's made be understand.", "description": "Hattie, 19, has only ever been on luxury breaks but is swapping that for three days in the great outdoors for 5Star's Rich Kids, Skint Holiday", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Kalel Productions"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20529981.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rich_Kids_Skint_Holiday_EP4_3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
