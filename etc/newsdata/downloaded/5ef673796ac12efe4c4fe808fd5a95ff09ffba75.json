The commitments total over $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cYou will see more of this,\u201d said industry analyst Hal Vogel of Vogel Capital Management, of the recent big programming deals.\n\nThe spending frenzy comes as four high-profile services\u2014from Apple Inc., Walt Disney Co. , Comcast and WarnerMedia\u2014are to launch between November and the spring, drastically increasing the entertainment options of customers and likely leading them to grapple with how to spend their money and their time.\n\nChannel Surfing NETFLIX Monthly Cost: $12.99\n\n$12.99 Launch Date: Running\n\nRunning Classic Show: \u2018Seinfeld\u2019\n\n\u2018Seinfeld\u2019 New Show: \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 HULU Monthly Cost: $5.99 (with ads); $11.99 (ad-free)\n\n$5.99 (with ads); $11.99 (ad-free) Launch Date: Running\n\nRunning Classic Show: \u2018ER\u2019\n\n\u2018ER\u2019 New Show: \u2018Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 AMAZON PRIME Monthly Cost: $8.99\n\n$8.99 Launch Date: Running\n\nRunning Classic Show: \u2018Sex and the City\u2019\n\n\u2018Sex and the City\u2019 New Show: \u2018Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u2019 APPLE TV+ Monthly Cost: $4.99\n\n$4.99 Launch Date: November\n\nNovember Classic Show: N/A\n\nN/A New Show: \u2018The Morning Show\u2019 DISNEY+ Monthly Cost: $6.99\n\n$6.99 Launch Date: November\n\nNovember Classic Show: \u2018The Simpsons\u2019\n\n\u2018The Simpsons\u2019 New Show: \u2018The Mandalorian\u2019 HBO MAX Monthly Cost: To be determined\n\nTo be determined Launch Date: Spring\n\nSpring Classic Show: \u2018Friends\u2019\n\n\u2018Friends\u2019 New Show: \u2018The Flight Attendant\u2019 PEACOCK Monthly Cost: To be determined\n\nTo be determined Launch Date: Spring\n\nSpring Classic Show: \u2018The Office\u2019\n\n\u2018The Office\u2019 New Show: \u2018Rutherford Falls\u2019 Sources: WSJ reporting; the companies\n\nStreaming-video consumers are willing to pay for a handful of services that cost a total of about $38 a month for about six streaming services, according to a Magid Research survey conducted last year.\n\nApple said last week that its TV+ service would be launched Nov. 1 for $4.99 a month\u2014cheaper than Netflix\u2019s $12.99 monthly standard option and Disney\u2019s $6.99 monthly fee for a service also expected to arrive in November.\n\nComcast and AT&T have yet to reveal the cost of their respective offerings, Peacock and HBO Max, both of which are to be launched in the spring. Comcast has said the Peacock service would be free to its existing U.S. cable subscribers, and HBO Max is expected to cost more than $15.\n\nA customer who doesn\u2019t have a cable-TV subscription and wants access to all major streaming services\u2014which also include Disney\u2019s Hulu and Amazon.com Inc. \u2019s Prime Video\u2014would likely have to fork over $70 a month for packages that lack access to live TV. Factoring in what is known as a skinny bundle, such as Dish Network Corp. \u2019s Sling TV or Alphabet Inc. \u2019s YouTube TV, the monthly cost of comprehensive over-the-internet video content would be higher than that of a traditional pay-TV package, which the Kagan unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence said averages over $90 a month.\n\nHBO Max\u2019s deal for \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d and Netflix\u2019s acquisition of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d\u2014both of which are said to be worth about $500 million for five years\u2014underscore how important popular reruns are to streaming services. Episodes of hit shows often retain audience acclaim years and decades after their initial run, and are seen as must-have programming.\n\n\u201cThere are a very limited number of excellent comedy titles that have a large number of episodes and are evergreen,\u201d said Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson Research, who described the prices of the recent rerun deals as \u201cfair value.\u201d\n\n\u201cNetflix had a monopoly on these shows a few years back at fair prices,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cThat is no longer the case.\u201d\n\nSteve Carell, rear, in \u2018The Office.\u2019 Mr. Carrell will be among the stars of \u2018Morning Show,\u2019 an original Apple program.

Apple\u2019s \u201cMorning Show\u201d will star Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell; Peacock\u2019s original programming will feature Alec Baldwin and Demi Moore; Disney+ is launching a \u201cStar Wars\u201d spinoff; and WarnerMedia signed producer J.J. Abrams, who will develop content for HBO Max as part of his deal.\n\nThe new services\u2019 original-content strategy marks a seminal moment for the industry. Last year, nearly 500 original scripted shows were available across all video platforms, almost twice as many as in 2011, according to research by Disney\u2019s FX Networks.\n\nBut the growing competition is also prompting new streaming services to shell out between $8 million and $15 million an episode, significantly more than what the average TV show used to cost.\n\nNot all players are equally equipped to deal with the investment spree required to acquire classic shows and develop new content. Entertainment isn\u2019t a core business for Apple and Amazon, and both companies generate significant amounts of cash. Amazon recently agreed to spend $250 million just for the rights to develop a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series. Apple said TV+ would be free for a year with the purchase of a new iPhone, iPad or Mac.\n\nNetflix, on the other hand, has borrowed heavily to build its streaming dominance. It leads all rivals with 60 million customers in the U.S. and a further 91.5 million abroad, but its long-term debt is over $12 billion. And for the first time in nearly a decade, Netflix lost U.S. subscribers in its most recent quarter.\n\nComcast, the nation\u2019s largest cable operator, needs to balance its desire to create a consumer-friendly streaming service without undercutting its core pay-TV business or alienating other pay-TV operators that carry its various networks, including NBC, CNBC, MSNBC and USA. In an effort to navigate these matters, its Peacock service is expected to be available free to Comcast\u2019s more than 21 million cable subscribers in the U.S. In addition, Comcast and NBCUniversal are looking to strike deals with other American pay-TV providers that would allow them to offer Peacock to their subscribers free as well, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nDisney, AT&T and Comcast have plans to enter the streaming-video ring, armed with well-known TV and movie brands. But can they hold their own against industry juggernaut Netflix? Photo illustration: Heather Seidel/The Wall Street Journal\n\nAT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia is in a different predicament. The company already owns a popular direct-to-consumer service, HBO Now, which gives access to all of HBO\u2019s content. But at $14.99 a month, it is more expensive than Apple and Disney\u2019s new streaming services combined. WarnerMedia\u2019s coming service, HBO Max, will feature HBO\u2019s content on top of a vast TV and movie library, as well as original projects from stars such as Nicole Kidman, Ms. Witherspoon and Anna Kendrick. The company has yet to settle on a price for the new service, which has to be higher than $15 so as not to undercut HBO\u2019s existing agreements with pay-TV distributors\u2014but still be affordable enough to remain competitive given the flurry of coming lower-priced alternatives. A person familiar with the matter expects the service to cost slightly more than $15.\n\nDisney expects streaming to become a new source of growth as the traditional pay-TV business\u2014once the engine of its expansion\u2014matures. The company, which already owns Hulu and ESPN+, expects Disney+ to have between 60 million and 90 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024. It is spending heavily in an effort to achieve that goal, betting on ambitious shows such as \u201cStar Wars\u201d spinoff \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d whose cost for an episode approaches $15 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Disney+ also will house episodes of the long-running Fox animated hit \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d as well as the original trio of \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies.\n\nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com and David Marcelis at david.marcelis@wsj.com", "description": "Entertainment heavyweights have spent over $2 billion on classic television shows in recent weeks, in an effort to win over streaming customers who soon will have many more options to choose from.", "authors": ["Joe Flint", "David Marcelis", "Joe.Flint Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108083/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
