Deep down, in her heart of hearts, she knows this was wrong. I wish her well in her future career,\u201d said Independent Media chairperson Dr Iqbal Surv\u00e9.\n\nThe paper led with an article on an adverse finding by the Public Protector regarding an R800m fishing vessel management tender awarded to a subsidiary of Sekunjalo, the holding company of Independent Newspapers and Media SA, on the day of Mandela's death.\n\nIndependent Newspapers said it was their view that the former editor\u2019s case was flimsy, had no basis in law or Constitution and was driven by \u201cquixotic public posturing, and had nothing to do with issues of press freedom\u201d.\n\n\u2018Not motivated by racism\u2019\n\nIn the settlement agreement filed in the Labour Court on Friday, Independent Newspapers conceded that her decision was not intended by any way to show disrespect for Nelson Mandela.\n\nThey also acknowledged that she was not motivated by racism.\n\nIn their statement on Monday, however, they slammed her decision again.\n\n\u201cWe maintain that this was an affront to the dignity and legacy of democratic South Africa\u2019s founder, although Dasnois has subsequently claimed this was not her intention. We must also emphasise that every editor in the Independent group \u2013 and virtually every other journalist \u2013 disagreed with Dasnois\u2019s decision despite her subsequent public posturing.\u201d\n\nDasnois said on Monday she would not do anything differently, and hailed the settlement as a victory for all journalists.\n\nShe said she never thought one decision over \"an icon\" would have led to her dismissal.\n\nOpen Democracy Advice Centre, speaking on behalf of Dasnois, laughed off Independent\u2019s victory lap.\n\n\u201cThey still conceded that it was her editorial prerogative,\u201d head of Advocacy Alison Tilley said.\n\nAlide Dasnois will go done in history as the editor who never lead with the story of the decade 'the death of Nelson Mandela' @IndyMediaSA \u2014 Moshe Apleni (@mosheapleni) May 9, 2016", "description": "Independent Newspapers says its settlement with former Cape Times editor Alide Dasnois \"vindicates\" the company\u2019s position.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3953/b536f48fbe004de1aa1b27ee5021506a.jpg", "published_at": "2016-05-09"}
