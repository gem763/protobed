There's lots of abuse on social media in different forms and I do have big concerns about it as a medium because you can be attacked in your own home.\n\n'In the old days, you could have a bad day at work, you might be bullied at school as a kid, but you could go home, shut the door and you were safe, and now you're not safe. You can be attacked in your own home.\n\n'As a parent, and as a coach of young kids, that worries me as a dynamic in our society. I think there are many broad areas around social media that probably require some reflection.'\n\nSouthgate worries not just for his players but children and young people in general\n\nEngland players are taught how to use social media effectively by the media professionals from the moment they are called up into age-group teams.\n\nSouthgate said: 'What we do with our players is that from a young age the media department talk to players about their media responsibilities and social media responsibilities and try to help them with that situation.\n\n'It's a really difficult world really to navigate for obvious complications, really. Anything that is public, they are there for everyone to scrutinise.\n\n'So, I think from an England perspective, if we, as I say, at all age groups we try to work with them, but of course, it's the individuals who are in control or their team that's around them that are in control of what's put out there.'", "description": "England manager Gareth Southgate has expressed his concerns about the corrosive effects of social media on young people with his players coming in for increasingly violent and often racist abuse.", "authors": ["Rob Draper For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/00/19346186-0-image-a-41_1570316563815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
