Houston finished with 107 wins and the Yankees 103, giving the Astros hosting rights for the first two games of the ALCS and the last two.\n\nAnd so after losing Game 7 at Minute Maid Park two years ago, the Yankees lost their fourth straight ALCS since their last World Series title in 2009.\n\nNew York went 1 for 6 with runners in scoring position, finishing 6 for 35 (.171) in the series with 42 runners left on base \u2014 that after leading the majors with a .294 RISP during the season. The Yankees lived and died by the homer, scoring 16 of their 21 runs in the series on 10 long balls. They struck out 11 times in Game 6, raising their series total to 64.\n\nNew York has gone longer between World Series seasons, but the 2010s are the first decade since their first championship in 1923 that the Yankees didn't even get a chance to win a title.\n\nBoone, whose Game 7 homer lifted the Yankees over Boston in Game 7 of the 2003 ALCS, has avoided saying whether anything short of a title was a failure.\n\n\"I know as an organization myself, our players, we're chasing a championship and we're doing everything we can. We want to be champions. So that's the goal. That's the focus,\" Boone said.\n\n\"Putting a label, success, fail, all that, I don't really have time for it, honestly,\" he said. \"I'm proud to go compete with those guys every day. I reject it a little bit but I don't really get caught up in the question, either.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
