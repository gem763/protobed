With a quiet space finally secured, the head coach took a seat behind a large desk and leaned back in a swivel chair.\n\nHis ever-stoic expression offered no inkling of the array of emotions experienced over the past 72 hours.\n\nThe tension that preceded a close victory.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe relief of winning the first game of the season.\n\nThe euphoria of watching a dominant performance by a rookie quarterback so many had doubted.\n\nGiants quarterback Daniel Jones (8) seized the moment in his first NFL start. Up next Sunday: the Washington Redskins in his first start at home. (USA TODAY Sports)\n\nJust hours earlier, Daniel Jones had earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for his performance Sunday against Tampa Bay. And yet, Shurmur\u2019s demeanor remained as routine as any other ordinary Wednesday. There was no edge in his voice, no snarkiness, no puffed-out chest as he sat with his arms resting behind his head.\n\nIn a moment primed for the ultimate, \u201cI told you so,\u201d Shurmur was as even-keeled and measured as the new face of the franchise.\n\nTo the outside world, Jones\u2019 impressive showing against the Bucs \u2014 336 passing yards, plus a pair of passing touchdowns and a pair of rushing TDs, including a game-winning 7-yard score up the middle \u2014 was a statement game. Not only for him, but for the front office that was ridiculed for believing so much in Jones\u2019 ability that it used the sixth-overall pick to draft him in April.\n\nBut, at least publicly, Shurmur, insisted that Jones\u2019 first NFL start (and the Giants\u2019 32-31 victory) provided no sense of vindication or relief.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t live my life that way,\u201d Shurmur told Yahoo Sports after Wednesday's practice. \u201cI don\u2019t really feel like we need him to be successful to prove people wrong.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe know what we thought. And we believe in what we saw. And that\u2019s why we were happy he was able to go out and have success. It wasn\u2019t like, \u2018Hey, he showed you.\u2019 That\u2019s not the way we function here. Because if you function that way, then what you\u2019re saying is you care outside the building what people think. And it\u2019s the same trap, if they say good or they say bad. I don\u2019t worry about that. It wasn\u2019t relief. I was happy for the guys in the room, that we found a way to win a game.\u201d\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free. Here\u2019s how]\n\nThe Giants have traversed the delicate tight rope of transitioning from a franchise legend to a newbie. And while the changing of the guard in East Rutherford was, perhaps, overdue (and, at times, awkwardly mishandled), the changeover is finally complete. Shurmur\u2019s decision to bench Eli Manning \u2014 their 38-year-old, two-time Super Bowl champion and leader the past 14 seasons \u2014 reset the direction of the organization and injected life into a listless offense and much-needed energy into their locker room. But, according to Shurmur, there was no one moment in particular that caused him to hand over the team to Jones. It simply felt right, he said.\n\n\u201cIt was my gut,\u201d the coach said. \u201cThat\u2019s your second brain. And my gut said that it was time. And he had a significant impact in our win. So it worked out.\u201d\n\nA different vibe now filters through the hallways of the Giants\u2019 building.\n\nA distinctive buzz.\n\nA feeling that something special is on the horizon.\n\nDaniel Jones celebrates with head coach Pat Shurmur after a touchdown against Tampa. (Getty Images)\n\nAnd, in time, Shurmur and general manager Dave Gettleman will learn whether or not their fateful decision in April was truly the best move for the organization \u2014 and their job security.\n\nFor now, though, the Giants and Jones are focused on the task at hand: defeating the Washington Redskins.\n\nJones, who will make his MetLife Stadium debut Sunday, said he isn\u2019t worried about his newfound celebrity. He remains the same as he was a little more than a week ago, back when he was just Manning\u2019s backup: Measured. Humble. Unassuming.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing,\u201d Jones said, when asked about the attention he\u2019s now garnering as the starter. \u201cI go home and then I come into work every day.\u201d\n\nThis city once rode the emotional roller coaster of Mark Sanchez\u2019s tenure, nicknaming him \u201cThe Sanchize\u201d along the way, and was later enthralled by flashes of the Geno Smith era. So much optimism surrounded these two former Jets\u2019 draft-picks that the New York Daily News used the backpage headline, \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d for each quarterback. Now, Jones \u2014 who\u2019s still adjusting to his \u201cDanny Dimes\u201d moniker \u2014 joins current Jets starter Sam Darnold as another Big Apple star in the making.\n\nJones\u2019 top 10-selection was so stunning that he was booed by Giants fans across the Tri-State area when his name was called on draft night. Even some of his Giants teammates weren\u2019t fully on board with the pick. But the former Duke star quickly won over the locker room with his preparation and his play.\n\nThat\u2019s why few people inside the building were surprised by his performance against the Bucs. It was just a continuation of what they\u2019d witnessed this past offseason.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is coming in and doing your job, but doing it at a high level,\u201d veteran safety Michael Thomas told Yahoo Sports. \u201cThat earns the respect of everybody from the jump and you don\u2019t have to say a word. That\u2019s literally what the story of \u2018D.J.\u2019 was for us.\n\n\u201cWe were practicing in the offseason, doing routes, and he is consistently just slicing and dicing and making it look easy. Not looking stressed, not looking like a rookie. Not talking noise or nothing. And you\u2019d be in perfect coverage and he\u2019s just dropping the ball where his receivers can catch it and he\u2019s doing it constantly. It was like, \u2018Whoa. Either this is a fluke or this kid can really play.\u2019 \u2026 If you can play, guys are going to respect you. And from Day 1, everybody was like, \u2018OK. The kid can play.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow, the question is: What will the kid do for an encore?\n\nWhile grateful for the support he has received from family, friends and teammates, Jones is fixated on the areas of his game that still need improvement. Namely, ball security. (He fumbled twice against the Bucs.) It\u2019s his work ethic and never-satisfied attitude that those around him find most endearing.\n\nShurmur acknowledged areas in which Jones must get better, but he also praised the quarterback's decision-making \u2014 \u201cHow he handles his life. How he goes about his day. How he studies. All the way down to where he throws the ball,\u201d he explained \u2014 as well as Jones\u2019 timing and accuracy.\n\nThe coach also stressed two other key attributes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s things about him, as a person, that I admire and that\u2019s why I think he\u2019s going to have a chance to be successful,\u201d Shurmur said. \u201cAt the top of all of this, I think he\u2019s tough. And at the top of all this, I think he has great poise. And I think that\u2019s what you need from people and players in positions of authority. They have to be tough and they have to have poise. Because if they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll get rattled and then the people around them will see that.\u201d\n\nA short time later, Jones stood on the back patio of the facility overlooking the practice field, fielding questions from a playoff-size crowd of reporters. From there, he would do a TV interview, answering questions about his nickname preference, \u201cDanny Dimes\u201d or \u201cD.J.,\u201d and then he ended his media obligations with one final one-on-one request.\n\nAs the 22-year-old discussed the added responsibilities that come with his new high-profile role and stressed the importance of remaining solely focused on football, a sudden thud interrupted his train of thought.\n\nA large, shadowy figure \u2014 pressed against one of the cafeteria windows overlooking the patio \u2014 suddenly came into focus. Jones smiled at the player, whose face was hidden from view, but whose stomach was squished against the glass.\n\nIf the goal was to rattle the Giants quarterback, it didn\u2019t work.\n\nWithout missing a beat, the rookie resumed his conversation.\n\n\u201cAs a team, it was big for us to get the first win and build off of it,\u201d Jones said, sounding like a carbon copy of his predecessor. \u201cIndividually, that\u2019s kind of my mindset: to find a way to build off of it. There\u2019s a number of things I need to do better and that\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on this week. Just being consistent and being the best version of myself I can be.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Few people inside the Giants building were surprised by Jones' performance vs. the Bucs.
