The fighters were directed by Abu Zainab al-Lami, head of security for the Hashid [Hashd al-Shaabi, or Popular Mobilization Forces], a grouping of mostly Shi\u2019ite Muslim paramilitaries backed by Iran, the second source said. The Hashid leader was tasked with quashing the protests by a group of other senior militia commanders, the source said. The sources did not say how many snipers were deployed by militia groups.\n\nA spokesman for the militia group denied the report, insisting \u201cnone of the elements of the PMF took part in confronting protesters.\u201d The Iraqi Interior Ministry denied there was a deliberate plan to kill protesters with sniper fire and blamed the deaths on \u201cvicious\u201d killers of uncertain identity.\n\nHowever, at least one senior militia commander was willing to tell Reuters his forces \u201cjumped in\u201d to support the Baghdadi government at the height of the unrest.\n\n\u201cIranian advisors insisted on having a role and warned us that the ongoing protests, if not reversed, will undermine the government of Abdul Mahdi,\u201d the commander said.\n\nPrime Minister Abdul Mahdi\u2019s office said an investigation is still underway, so it would be \u201cpremature to lay the blame on any parties, whether from Hashid or other security forces.\u201d\n\nThe snipers were seen plying their deadly trade from the rooftops of Baghdad by some journalists, including those working for Reuters, but they wore masks and unmarked dark clothing, making their affiliation difficult to determine.\n\nReuters pointed out there was definitely cooperation between Abdul Mahdi\u2019s government and Iran\u2019s infamous Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) during the protests, including consultations with \u201csenior Revolutionary Guard officers with experience in curbing civil unrest.\u201d The IRGC has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government.\n\nThe death toll during Iraqi protests was well over a hundred, plus over 6,000 injuries, about 1,200 of them sustained by security forces. Protesters claimed they had video evidence of government forces perpetrating atrocities against them, but were prevented from sharing that evidence by an Internet blackout.\n\nThe protests have not been exclusively Sunni Muslims complaining about the Shiite-dominated government. Influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr on Tuesday urged his followers to \u201cmobilize by the millions\u201d to protest corruption in the Baghdad government \u2013 plus, of course, his usual hate fetishes, America and Israel.\n\n\u201cMarch draped in your shrouds \u2026 and chant on Arbaeen: No to America! No to Israel! No to the corrupt!\u201d Sader said on Twitter, referring to the annual Arbaeen pilgrimage to the Iraqi city of Karbala, the largest such event in Shia Islam.", "description": "Iraq security sources say snipers from Iran-backed militia units were employed to kill civilians during massive protests in early October.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/ambulance-iraq.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
