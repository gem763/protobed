Each contestant presented themselves as being able to sell and think strategically but neither ability was evident from anyone when it came to the crunch.\n\n\u201cThe collective ignorance of selling was summed up by Ryan-Mark\u2019s assertion that being a great public speaker is all you need for a negotiation. This is utterly false. Being a professional salesperson means that you have a clear strategy, but the lack of this was a recurring theme throughout for both the boys\u2019 and the girls\u2019 teams.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nThe girls looked very unprofessional when they came out of their pitch to discuss figures, while the boys didn't arrange an actual time to meet their client.\n\nRichard says: \"We saw no pre-pitch planning, no definition of objectives and no identification of the margin that would allow them to understand their minimum price. Before walking into any negotiation, it is imperative to do your homework on the prospective client and be clear of the target price and how to deal with a discount based on number of items wanted.\n\n\"Equally important is knowing what role each team member will take \u2013 who explains the product, who understands the client\u2019s needs and who captures all the information. Unforgivably, it transpired that not a single team member had taken any notes!\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nThe boys' corporate client was stunned when they turned up with their unimpressive ice lollies and even pointed out their \"rude\" shape.\n\nThey tried to reduce their price dramatically from \u00a33.85, even offering them up at a mere \u00a31.25, but the client refused to buy any for more than a pound.\n\nRichard believes that Lord Sugar was wrong to fire Kenna - and that Dean should have been sent packing from the competition.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nAnalysing the teams, Richard says: \u201cWhat we witnessed from both teams was a complete disregard for any strategy and an eagerness to only concentrate on price \u2013 when negotiating, there are many elements at play, not just price.\n\n\u201cHad Dean fully understood the margin, he would have recognised that the offer of \u00a31 per ice-lolly was still profitable. However, the lack of strategy and communication amongst the team meant that he was blind to this, the offer was declined, and the boys walked away patting themselves on the back. For this reason, I think that Dean should have been fired \u2013 he got it wrong and was too fixated on being seen as the star deal maker.\n\n\u201cAt least the girls got somewhat of a deal, especially since the product was poor \u2013 but we still experienced poor negotiation. With no idea on price, mark-up, strategy around the deal and team roles \u2013 plus having to break from the meeting to come back with nothing new to offer \u2013 this was professionally inadequate, and no deal would have succeeded in the real world. They clearly didn\u2019t invest time in covering the basics around the product, margin and deal dynamics.\"\n\nThe only candidate that impressed Richard with their selling skills was Tommy Skinner, who was praised by Claude Littner for his sales technique.\n\nHe adds: \"The only display of selling skill came from Tommy \u2013 but as a life-long market trader, the poor product quality was offset by his charismatic selling style.\n\n\"His past experience allowed him to work out very quickly how long to spend on each potential buyer; understanding interest and persuasion to buy. The rest were a bit of a wet weekend.\"\n\n*The Apprentice airs Wednesdays on BBC One at 9pm", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Business and sales expert Richard Hilton was stunned by the candidates' 'unforgivable' mistakes - and thinks Lord Sugar got it wrong", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20545139.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Apprentice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
