Victory alone will not be enough for Hamilton to win the title this weekend.\n\nEven if he wins and bags a bonus point for fastest lap, Hamilton will need Bottas to finish off the podium to secure an unassailable lead.\n\nBut Hamilton can finish as low as third and win the championship if Bottas finishes no higher than 10th.\n\nIf Hamilton is not on the podium - which has happened at the previous two Mexican GPs - he will need to wait at least one more weekend even if Bottas fails to score points at all. Hamilton's title permutations\n\nThe bonus point complicates matters. If Hamilton fails to set the fastest lap, or Bottas gets the extra point, then Hamilton is champion if:\n\nHamilton finishes Bottas is no higher than 1st 5th 2nd 8th 3rd 10th\n\nBut if Hamilton sets fastest lap, the permutations shift slightly. He will be champion if:\n\nHamilton finishes Bottas is no higher than 1st 4th 2nd 8th 3rd 9th\n\nWhat Hamilton must do to win title in Mexico More\n\nWhile Hamilton's sixth title is effectively a matter of time, barring a stunning turn of events, his team boss Toto Wolff said a sixth consecutive championship double for Mercedes is something \"no one would have dreamed\" would happen.\n\nBut he anticipates neither of his drivers having a straightforward grand prix in Mexico.\n\n\"We know that the four remaining races are not going to be easy and we expect Mexico to be the most difficult one for us,\" said Wolff.\n\n\"The high altitude of the track brings some fairly unusual challenges as the low air density affects the downforce of the car, the cooling and the engine performance.\n\n\"It's a combination that doesn't particularly suit our car, but we will give it everything to try and limit the damage.\"\n\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus", "description": "Lewis Hamilton will secure his sixth Formula 1 world championship if he outscores Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas by 12 points in this weekend's Mexican Grand Prix", "authors": ["Scott Mitchell"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_2Gu0YdcPIH_d61k0kfDfQ--~B/aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autosport_578/0fc9700513afc1d4b0e0592e4e247b2e", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
