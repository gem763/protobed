Because it is.\"\n\n\"11 o'clock every Friday morning come get arrested with me or choose not to it doesn't matter,\" told ABC News in an earlier interview about her planned effort.\n\nPHOTO: Jane Fonda is arrested while participating in climate change protest at the U.S. Capitol, Oct. 11, 2019, in Washington, D.C.

We need -- we need you to support us.' And so grandmas unite,\" she said. \"I want to stand with them and raise up... their message. This is -- this is serious... This is a crisis unlike anything that has ever faced humankind.\"\n\nStressing she was not being hyperbolic, Fonda said this is the \"one issue\" that matters because it \"will determine the survival of our species,\" and said that's why she'll be attending Fire Drill Fridays weekly.\n\nPHOTO: Actress and activist Jane Fonda talks to a crowd of protestors during a global climate rally at Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles on Sept. 20, 2019.

Those -- those things don't even matter,\" she told Parks. \"This is the future. This is whether we're going to survive.\"\n\nFonda also said that the United States needs \"to lead the way\" on this issue, so that other countries who contribute heavily to greenhouse gas emissions, like China and India, \"follow suit.\"\n\nWhile she's been passionate about this issue for \"decades,\" she credits her current endeavors on Thunberg's recurring protest outside Swedish parliament, and other student climate strikers around the world for taking on this issue so passionately.\n\nPHOTO: Teenage Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg delivers brief remarks surrounded by other student environmental advocates during a strike to demand action be taken on climate change outside the White House on Sept. 13, 2019 in Washington.
