Sixty-seven votes are needed to convict a president.\n\nGraham first floated the idea of discarding articles of impeachment during an interview this week with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity Sean Patrick HannityThe Hill's 12:30 Report \u2014 Presented by Nareit \u2014 Trump lifting Turkey sanctions after claiming 'permanent' ceasefire Clinton 2020 whisper campaign hits new heights Graham to introduce resolution condemning House impeachment inquiry MORE, where he argued the Senate should go \u201con record condemning the House.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the point of the resolution: Any impeachment vote based on this process, to me, is illegitimate, is unconstitutional, and should be dismissed in the Senate without a trial,\u201d Graham said.\n\nThe push to promptly dismiss any articles sent by the House comes as Republicans have homed in on the process being used by House Democrats. The chamber is weeks into their impeachment inquiry, which is being overseen by the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight and Reform committees.\n\nThe closed-door sessions have sparked a constant churn of headline-grabbing news. But Republicans have fumed as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiSpeier to run for Oversight gavel Graham nixes plan to send Pelosi letter warning GOP won't convict Trump House passes third bill aimed at preventing foreign election interference MORE (D-Calif.) has refused to hold an inquiry vote \u2014 something she says isn\u2019t required by the rules. House Republicans opted to vote for an impeachment inquiry during their investigation of President Clinton.\n\nRepublicans have noted repeatedly that the House probe has been behind closed doors and most members are unable to sit in on the ongoing depositions. Frustrated House Republicans stormed a closed-door hearing Wednesday to protest the Democrats\u2019 probe, delaying the proceedings and triggering a fresh round of partisan finger-pointing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), another vocal ally of Trump\u2019s, threw his support behind Graham\u2019s idea and compared the House impeachment inquiry process to how an investigation would be run in Russia.\n\n\u201cI would absolutely support that given the way this is being conspired in the House,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re getting is a show trial right now, so when it comes to the Senate, the Senate has an opportunity, I think, to push back on that.\u201d\n\nRudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiTrump's new challenge is officials dishing dirt Budowsky: Trump presidency in mortal peril Graham nixes plan to send Pelosi letter warning GOP won't convict Trump MORE, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, has also backed the Senate dismissing any articles of impeachment, telling The Hill earlier this month that it would be \u201chorrible\u201d if the Senate held a trial.\n\n\u201cIt would probably be dismissed immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Kevin Cramer Kevin John CramerTrump allies mull how to quickly quash impeachment articles McConnell has complicated history on impeachment Lawmakers toast Greta Van Susteren's new show MORE (R-N.D.) said it isn\u2019t clear to him if senators can bring up the vote but \u201cif the articles don\u2019t come up with any evidence, I suppose we could do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could see a scenario where there\u2019s no evidence to even support what they\u2019ve done, and perhaps at that point a motion to dismiss would be in order and we do,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring former President Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial, Graham \u2014 then a House member who served as a floor manager \u2014 spoke out against a motion to dismiss that was offered by then-Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.). Byrd\u2019s motion ultimately failed.\n\n\u201cTo dismiss an impeachment trial under these facts and under these circumstances would be unbelievable, in my opinion, and do a lot of damage to the law and to the ultimate decision this body has to make whether or not Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonCNN: Biden likened Clinton impeachment to 'partisan lynching' in 1998 Trump 'lynching' comparison draws backlash from lawmakers House Democrat pledges 'there will be open hearings' in impeachment inquiry MORE should be our president. And as I understand the general nature of the law, the facts and the law break our way for this motion,\u201d Graham said, according to a transcript of the deliberations.\n\nUnder the Senate\u2019s rules governing impeachment, any senator can make a motion and any motion, except a motion to adjourn, will be made in writing. House managers or the president\u2019s team, according to the same rules, can also direct \u201call motions, objections, requests, or applications\u201d to the presiding officer, who would be Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nMotions made during the trial would need a majority to pass.

Normally for simple majority votes in the Senate, he can lose three because Vice President Pence is able to break a tie when he presides over the chamber.\n\nA Senate GOP leadership aide noted in a memo about the Senate\u2019s impeachment rules that a motion to dismiss would be in order.\n\n\u201cPlease note that a motion to dismiss the articles is in order under impeachment rules, and a majority vote on the motion to dismiss occurred during the impeachment trial of President Clinton (following the opening arguments and a limited period of questioning by members of the Senate),\u201d the aide wrote.\n\nGOP senators have discussed impeachment during closed-door caucus lunches over the past two weeks. McConnell and staff gave a PowerPoint presentation last week where the possibility of dismissing any articles of impeachment came up as a question.\n\nBut the chatter about trying to dismiss any articles of impeachment is at odds with signals from leadership officials, who have increasingly said they expect the chamber to hold a trial if the House passes articles of impeachment.\n\n\u201cI think a trial is more likely,\u201d said Sen.

Byrd somehow made the motion and I don\u2019t understand how he did because I would expect it would more likely come from the people presenting the case,\u201d Blunt added.\n\nMcConnell, after last week\u2019s closed-door briefing, shot down a question from a reporter about if his Facebook ads positioning himself as an impeachment roadblock meant there wouldn\u2019t be a Senate trial.\n\n\u201cUnder the impeachment rules of the Senate, we\u2019ll take the matter up. The chief justice will be in the chair ... We intend to do our constitutional responsibility,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nAsked this week if he would try to dismiss the articles of impeachment, McConnell said that he won\u2019t have \u201cball control\u201d during an impeachment trial.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be up to me. Unlike other procedures in the Senate, the majority leader does not really have ball control here. ... I don\u2019t see anybody in all of this, myself or others, who would be able to control the process. At some point, it ends,\u201d he said.\n\nPressed if he would support a quick dismissal, McConnell demurred, arguing that \u201cthere are all kinds of potentials.\u201d\n\nAlexander Bolton contributed.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s biggest allies in the Senate are looking to quickly quash articles of impeachment that the Democratic-controlled House might pass in the coming months.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/grahamlindsey_102219gn2_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
