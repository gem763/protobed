The breakthroughs they achieved also made storing energy from renewable sources more feasible, opening up a whole new front in the fight against global warming.\n\n\u201cThis is a highly charged story of tremendous potential,\u201d quipped Olof Ramstrom of the Nobel committee for chemistry.\n\nThe prize announced Wednesday went to John B. Goodenough, 97, an American engineering professor at the University of Texas; M. Stanley Whittingham, 77, a British-American chemistry professor at the State University of New York at Binghamton, and Akira Yoshino, 71, of chemicals company Asahi Kasei Corp. and Meijo University in Japan.\n\nThe three scientists were honored for a truly transformative technology that has permeated billions of lives across the planet, including anyone who uses cellphones, computers, pacemakers, electric cars and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe heart of the phone is the rechargeable battery. The heart of the electric vehicle is the rechargeable battery. The success and failure of so many new technologies depends on the batteries,\u201d said Alexej Jerschow, a chemist at New York University, whose research focuses on lithium-ion battery diagnostics.\n\nGoodenough, who is considered an intellectual giant of solid state chemistry and physics, is the oldest person to ever win a Nobel Prize \u2014 edging Arthur Ashkin, who was 96 when he was awarded the Nobel for physics last year.\n\nGoodenough still works every day and said he is grateful he was not forced to retire at age 65. \u201cSo I\u2019ve had an extra 33 years to keep working,\u201d he told reporters in London.\n\nWhittingham expressed hope the Nobel spotlight could give new impetus to efforts to meet the world\u2019s ravenous \u2014 and growing \u2014 demands for energy.\n\n\u201cI am overcome with gratitude at receiving this award, and I honestly have so many people to thank, I don\u2019t know where to begin,\u201d he said in a statement issued by his university. \u201cIt is my hope that this recognition will help to shine a much-needed light on the nation\u2019s energy future.\u201d\n\nThe three laureates each had unique breakthroughs that cumulatively laid the foundation for the development of a commercial rechargeable battery to replace alkaline batteries containing lead, nickel or zinc that had their origins in the 19th century.\n\nLithium-ion batteries are the first truly portable and rechargeable batteries, and took more than a decade to develop. Their discovery drew upon the work of multiple scientists in the U.S., Japan and around the world.\n\nThe work had its roots in the oil crisis in the 1970s. Whittingham, who had researched superconductors at Stanford University, was hired by Exxon at a time when the petroleum giant was investing in research into other fields of energy amid concerns about depleting oil reserves.\n\nExxon gave researchers like him \u201cthe freedom to do pretty much what they wanted as long as it did not involve petroleum,\u201d the Nobel committee said.\n\nIn his work, Whittingham harnessed the enormous tendency of lithium \u2014 the lightest metal \u2014 to give away its electrons to make a battery capable of generating just over two volts. Lithium, of all the elements, \u201cis the one that most willingly releases electrons,\u201d the committee said.\n\nBy 1980, building on Whittingham\u2019s work, Goodenough had doubled the capacity of the battery to four volts by using cobalt oxide in the cathode \u2014 one of two electrodes, along with the anode, that make up the ends of a battery.\n\nBut that battery remained too explosive for general commercial use. That\u2019s where Yoshino\u2019s work in the 1980s came in. He eliminated the volatile pure lithium from the battery, and instead opted for lithium ions that are safer.\n\nYoshino substituted petroleum coke, a carbon material, in the battery\u2019s anode. This step paved the way for the first lightweight, safe, durable and rechargeable commercial batteries to be built and enter the market in 1991.\n\n\u201cWe have gained access to a technical revolution,\u201d said Sara Snogerup Linse of the Nobel committee for chemistry, alluding to the environmental benefits of the discoveries. \u201cThe ability to store energy from renewable sources \u2014 the sun, the wind \u2014 opens up for sustainable energy consumption.\u201d\n\nWhittingham said he had no inkling that his work decades ago would have such a profound impact.\n\n\u201cWe thought it would be nice and help in a few things, but never dreamed it would revolutionize electronics and everything else,\u201d he told The Associated Press. He called the prize \u201crecognition for the whole field.\u201d\n\n\u201cHundreds of people have worked on lithium-ion batteries, and I think people felt that they were being overlooked,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this will push the field further and faster.\u201d\n\nThe trio will share a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award. Their gold medals and diplomas will be conferred in Stockholm on Dec. 10 \u2014 the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel\u2019s death in 1896.\n\nThe announcement came on the third day of Nobel week.\n\nOn Tuesday, Canadian-American James Peebles won the Nobel physics prize for his theoretical discoveries in cosmology together with Swiss scientists Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, who were honored for finding an exoplanet \u2014 a planet outside our solar system \u2014 that orbits a solar-type star.\n\nAmericans William G. Kaelin Jr. and Gregg L. Semenza and Britain\u2019s Peter J. Ratcliffe won the Nobel for advances in physiology or medicine on Monday. They were cited for their discoveries of \u201chow cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.\u201d\n\nTwo Nobel literature laureates are to be announced Thursday \u2014 one for 2018 and one for 2019 \u2014 because last year\u2019s award was suspended after a sex-abuse scandal rocked the Swedish Academy. The coveted Nobel Peace Prize is Friday and the economics award will be announced on Monday.\n\nYoshino said he mistakenly thought there might be a long wait before the Nobel committee turned to his specialty. He broke the news to his wife, who was just as surprised as he.\n\n\u201cI only spoke to her briefly and said, \u2018I got it,\u2019 and \u2026 she was so surprised that her knees almost gave way,\u201d he told reporters in Tokyo.\n\nThe laureates said the field and its applications are still a work in progress, and they want to keep at it.\n\nYoshino said lithium-ion batteries could have greater application in the ocean and space, but that further research and development are needed to adapt them to other gadgets and purposes. \u201cLithium-ion itself is still full of unknowns,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prize turned out to be a bit of a family affair among the researchers: Yoshino said he visits Goodenough nearly every year in Texas.\n\n\u201cFor him, I\u2019m like his son,\u201d the Japanese laureate said. \u201cHe takes very good care of me.\u201d\n\nGoodenough, in his own way, seemed to return the favor, telling reporters in London that in all of his 97 years: \u201cWhat am I most proud of? I don\u2019t know, I would say all my friends.\u201d\n\n___\n\nKeaten reported from Geneva. Associated Press writers Jan M.
