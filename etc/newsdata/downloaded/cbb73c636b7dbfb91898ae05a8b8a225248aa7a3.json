The result has meant that employers have had to bid for workers rather than workers bidding for jobs.\n\nMost recently, Breitbart News reported how oil corporations have had to drive up overtime pay for U.S. workers in order to meet labor demands even as they lobby for more readily available foreign workers to keep wages down.\n\nExtensive research by economists like George Borjas and analyst Steven Camarota reveals that the country\u2019s current mass legal immigration system burdens U.S. taxpayers and America\u2019s working and middle class while redistributing about $500 billion in wealth every year to major employers and newly arrived immigrants. Similarly, research has revealed how Americans\u2019 wages are crushed by the country\u2019s high immigration levels.\n\nToday, there are anywhere between 11 to 12 million Americans who want a full-time job but are unemployed, underemployed, or out of the labor force entirely. Still, the U.S. has continued admitting about 1.2 million legal immigrants a year to compete for working- and middle-class jobs against these sidelined Americans.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
