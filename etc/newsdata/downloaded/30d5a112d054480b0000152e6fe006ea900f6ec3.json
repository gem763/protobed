The former wrestler and actor would bring lots of charisma and personality to our school, which I think would bring lots of joy to the students. He is very popular and is a great human being. I\u2019d love to meet him.\n\nSaurav Gosain, 16, Caritas Tuen Mun Marden Foundation Secondary School\n\nMy friendly neighbourhood classmate\n\nI\u2019d definitely pick Tom Holland. Ever since he started playing Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he\u2019s become my favourite actor. I would love for him to be an exchange student at my school because he seems very friendly and charming. I would ask him for some acting tips, and in exchange, I would teach him some Cantonese and a little bit about Hong Kong.\n\nZenna Sultan, 17, HKTA The Yuen Yuen Institute No. 3 Secondary School\n\nWhat is the best way to cool down?\n\nThe Hong Kong Harry Potter?\n\nI\u2019d choose J.K. Rowling, the British author best known for writing the Harry Potter series. I grew up with her books and would love to talk to her about Harry Potter. Also, because I am passionate about writing and my dream is to one day become a novelist like her, I would love for her to give me some writing tips. I\u2019d also like to teach her more about Hong Kong and our culture and maybe that would inspire her to write a novel about Hong Kong in future!\n\nShiny Lai Shun-yin, 14, Tsuen Wan Government School\n\nCuz he\u2019s my cousin\n\nI\u2019d pick my cousin, John. He originally studied in Hong Kong and likes it here, but had to move to France with his family when he was 10. He wishes he could come back to Hong Kong to study and I\u2019d like to help make that happen for him. Although he couldn\u2019t stay forever, I think he\u2019d still be happy to come back.\n\nLeo Chan, 13, Scientia Secondary School\n\nKing James\n\nI\u2019d choose professional NBA basketball player LeBron James. I think he could teach me some awesome basketball tricks. I\u2019d love if he could be my classmate and train me in basketball so I can become my school\u2019s MVP.\n\nJacky Leung, 14, Ng Yuk Secondary School\n\nDoing it right: Your number one goal this school year\n\nA different perspective\n\nI\u2019d choose my mum because she always says she wants to know more about me. She often misunderstands me and doesn\u2019t seem to get why I am so stressed all the time. I think that we could learn more about each other if she were an exchange student at my school, and that our relationship could become stronger.\n\nGrace Chui, 17, Fung Kai Liu Man Shek Tong Secondary School\n\nWhat\u2019s it like to live in North Korea?\n\nI\u2019d like to have a student from North Korea be an exchange student at my school so I can learn more about the country. Since it\u2019s very difficult to travel to North Korea, I would take the opportunity to learn as much about the culture, politics, and daily life there as possible from the exchange student.\n\nDuncan Ho Tsz-tao, 14, Scientia Secondary School\n\nFree iPhones for everyone?\n\nI\u2019d like Tim Cook, the current CEO of Apple, to be an exchange student at my school. My school uses Apple products in our computer lessons, but I\u2019d like to learn more about its special functions. If he sat next to me in class, he could teach me the quickest way to complete all the tasks.\n\nDaniel Lee Tsz-tan, 13, Law Ting Pong Secondary School\n\nMaybe Greta Thunberg would be someone interesting to study with for a while. Photo: Reuters\n\nA role model\n\nGreta Thunberg. She would bring a lot of insight and vibrancy to my school community, and I\u2019m curious to know what the young activist has to say about the recent protests in Hong Kong.\n\nCharlotte Fung, 17, International Christian School\n\nLife with Nick\n\nI\u2019d pick motivational speaker Nick Vujicic. Although he was born without legs and arms, that hasn\u2019t stopped him from doing things like painting, using a computer, or even surfing! These days, students give up on doing their homework and exams when it gets too hard. I think having him at my school would inspire my schoolmates to not give up and always push themselves to their limits.\n\nRosanna Tung, 14, Law Ting Pong Secondary School\n\nEdited by Nicole Moraleda\n\nFor our next Top 10, tell us:\n\nIf you could add a new lunch option to your school canteen's menu, what would it be?\n\nSend your answer, together with your name, age and school, to reporters.club@scmp.com with \u201cTop 10: School lunch\u201d in the subject field.
