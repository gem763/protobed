When NBC selected her to help moderate the first Democratic presidential debate, Farhi raised an eyebrow. The Times distanced its reporters who cover political subjects from her program over what it viewed as a \u201csharply opinionated\u201d orientation. But these critiques do not track with her sense of self. She votes in Massachusetts, where she and Mikula retreat on the weekends, but says she registers a party affiliation only shortly before the primaries and then unregisters shortly afterward. She declined to ask anyone to write a blurb for \u201cBlowout\u201d because she considers the process ethically compromising. It\u2019s better, in her business, not to feel as if she owes anyone a favor.\n\nShe is studiously objective about the outcome of the Democratic primary race: \u201cThere\u2019s no current in me that I have to swim against in order to do that,\u201d she said. Politicking is her subject, not her game. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to get anybody elected. I\u2019m not trying to get any policy passed. I\u2019m not trying to get people to call their member of Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to explain what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201d\n\nWhen Maddow\u2019s old debate partner Tucker Carlson, who hosts the 8 p.m. hour over on Fox News, goes off the air, he told me, he often walks out the back of his studio and into his office, where he catches the beginning of Maddow\u2019s show. In the TV news business, Maddow is known for her unique approach to the \u201cA block,\u201d the opening act of the show before it cuts to commercial break. Rarely does she lead with the news. Instead, she backs into it, charging into a tale of some seemingly unrelated historical anecdote or long-lost news figure that zags unexpectedly toward a news peg. As her show dilates time, it imbues the day\u2019s news with a sense of world-historical climax. The day after the sitting president was targeted for impeachment, one of her chyrons read, \u201cLEAD PROSECUTOR IN AGNEW CASE WAS REPUBLICAN GEORGE BEAL.\u201d\n\nRecently, as Carlson was taking off his makeup and chatting with producers, they turned the volume up and watched her for 15 minutes, transfixed. \u201cIt was a legitimately esoteric story,\u201d he told me in a tone of genuine admiration. \u201cIt was about Donald Trump\u2019s campaign plane or something. I never fully understood the point she was making, but I found it totally compelling.\u201d\n\nMaddow essentially delivers an essay every night before moving into interviews and shorter blocks of analyses, all of which she writes with the help of a team of producers. She has called herself \u201cthe hermit of Rockefeller Center\u201d: While other personalities stalk the halls, seeking influence over network politics, she is holed up in her office writing, pausing only to conduct the daily production meeting, where she and her staff map out the day\u2019s show.\n\nOn the afternoon of Sept. 23, shortly after the Ukraine story broke, a couple of dozen staff members pooled into a corner of the office and waited for Maddow to emerge. They present as a humble assembly of New York\u2019s high-achieving news geeks. \u201cIt feels like a library up there,\u201d Phil Griffin, the president of MSNBC, told me. \u201cI hate to go up there and disrupt the focus.\u201d There are scratchy carpets, piles of books, walls papered with inside jokes. A dusty life-size wax figure of Dwight D. Eisenhower is seated in a fisherman\u2019s hat at a receptionist\u2019s desk. On the wall is a poster of \u201cTrump Organization Projects and Partners,\u201d over which has been tacked the image of Carrie Mathison, the \u201cHomeland\u201d C.I.A. officer known for her paranoid conspiracy walls and unhinged (but often on-point) investigations. Behind a warren of cubicles, a snaking list of dozens of potential topics to cover was carefully written in marker on a large white wall. At 2:45, Maddow crutched in silently, stood with her back to her staff and observed the list, drawing a thick black line next to topics that interested her.\n\nThough this was the day before an announcement of an impeachment inquiry \u2014 a moment Maddow had been gesturing toward for several years \u2014 she did not dig into the whistle-blower story right away. Instead, she made her way through a pile of unrelated issues: a protest in Kashmir, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s electability, changes to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s debate thresholds. Even in the meeting, even on that day, she took her time to get to the news.", "description": "How the MSNBC host staked her show on Trump \u2014 and won the largest and most obsessive audience of her career.", "authors": ["Amanda Hess"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/06/magazine/06-mag-maddow-cover/06-mag-maddow-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
