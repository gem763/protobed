Barr and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, on corruption investigations connected to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats.\n\nAlthough there was no explicit quid pro quo in the conversation, Mr. Trump raised the matter immediately after Mr. Zelensky spoke of his country\u2019s need for more help from the United States. The call came only days after Mr. Trump blocked $391 million in aid to Ukraine, a decision that perplexed national security officials at the time and that he has given conflicting explanations for in recent days.\n\nThe aid freeze did not come up during the call, and Mr. Zelensky was not yet aware of it. Instead, he thanked Mr. Trump for previous American aid, including Javelin anti-tank weapons, and suggested he would need more as part of Ukraine\u2019s five-year-old war with Russian-backed separatists in the country\u2019s east.", "description": "The reconstruction of call between the two leaders becomes a flash point in the evolving fight over impeachment.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/multimedia/25dc-impeach-sub/25dc-impeach-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
