In July, the Police Department amended a regulation that had limited residents from transporting guns outside their homes, after the Supreme Court had agreed to hear a case challenging the city rule.\n\nSupporters of repealing the conversion therapy ban said that it is a regrettable but necessary step given the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative makeup under the Trump administration.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I don\u2019t want to be someone who is giving in to these right-wing groups,\u201d Mr Johnson said in an interview. \u201cBut the Supreme Court has become conservative; the 2nd Circuit, which oversees New York, has become more conservative.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson introduced a bill Thursday to repeal the ban; once the full council approves the measure and Mayor Bill de Blasio signs it, the city would then be governed by a less restrictive state law, which applies only to minors.\n\nA vote could come by the end of the month, after a hearing, council officials said.\n\n\u201cWe think this is the most responsible, prudent course,\u201d Mr Johnson said.\n\nThe city\u2019s law, passed in December 2017, was sponsored by Melissa Mark-Viverito, then the council speaker. It prohibited consumers from being charged \u201cfor services intended to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity,\u201d and created a $1,000 fine for each violation.\n\nIn January, the Alliance Defending Freedom, an Arizona-based group, filed a lawsuit challenging the law on the grounds that it violated free speech, suggesting that the measure was \u201cthe first in the nation to censor speech\u201d between counsellors and adult patients.\n\n\u201cThis law was a textbook violation of free speech and the right of individuals to pursue the lives and identities they want to exercise,\u201d said Roger Brooks, a senior lawyer for the group, which says its mission is to defend religious freedom.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The American Psychological Association found in a 2009 report that the practice does not work and that \u201cindividuals experienced harm\u201d from the therapy. The therapy is also predicated on the false notion that LGBT+ sexual orientation is a mental disorder.\n\nIndividuals who are \u201cdistressed by their sexual orientation\u201d said that they benefit \u201cwhen offered interventions that emphasise acceptance, support and recognition of important values and concerns,\u201d according to the report.\n\nEighteen states, the District of Columbia and more than 50 municipalities have passed conversion therapy bans for minors, according to the National Center for Lesbian Rights. That still has not stopped the therapy from happening.\n\nThe Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law estimates that almost 700,000 LGBT+ adults aged 18-59 have received conversion therapy, including 359,000 who received the therapy as adolescents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m heartened that the City Council pulled back a statute that could undermine efforts nationally to end conversion therapy because it might be viewed as overly broad,\u201d said state Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan and the state\u2019s only openly gay senator. He sponsored the state law that would govern the city in the absence of a city-specific ban; it bars mental health professionals from seeking to shift the sexual orientation or gender identity of minors.\n\n\u201cThe legal climate is less favourable at the federal level for the LGBTQ community,\u201d he added. \u201cWe crafted the law specifically to pass a legal challenge because we knew this was an area that anti-LGBT legal forces were exploring.\u201d\n\nNew York City\u2019s law was viewed as being vulnerable to a challenge because it was much broader than similar statutes.\n\nThe city and state\u2019s consumer fraud laws will still allow adults who feel duped by the therapy to seek recompense, said Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights.\n\n\u201cNow that the state has passed its law, the New York City law does not create any new rights that don\u2019t exist. Having to defend that lawsuit is a completely unnecessary distraction,\u201d Mr Minter said. \u201cWe know there is relentless hostility against protecting LGBT people.\u201d\n\nThe current political environment means that activists must be more strategic, Mr Minter added. \u201cYou could trim a law back and avoid some vulnerability,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are being pushed to a whole new level of intelligent strategy.\u201d\n\nBrooks said that Alliance Defending Freedom has not decided whether to contest New York\u2019s efforts to repeal its law or challenge the New York state law. Similar conversion therapy bans for minors are being challenged in Maryland and Florida, but have already withstood challenges in California, the first state in the country to pass an anti-conversion law, and in New Jersey, Mr Minter said.\n\n\u201cConversion therapy is the ultimate form of rejection and the cause of many suicides among the LGBTQ community,\u201d said Mathew Shurka, founder and strategist of Born Perfect, a group seeking to outlaw conversion therapy.\n\nShurka, 31, who is gay, underwent conversion therapy for five years, starting as a teenager growing up in New York City. He said his main goal is to protect others, specifically young people, from experiencing what he did.\n\nMs Mark-Viverito, who is running for Congress, also endorsed the measure to kill her own legislation.\n\n\u201cI was very proud at the time, because we were doing something out of the box and we were aggressive,\u201d Ms Mark-Viverito said. \u201cBut understanding the climate we are in today, I\u2019m not interested in putting anyone\u2019s rights in jeopardy or weakening our power as a city.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Nearly two years ago, the New York City Council celebrated when it passed a far-reaching ban on conversion therapy, a discredited practice to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity.
