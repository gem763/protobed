The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nKushner was last in the Middle East at the end of July, as Breitbart News reported.\n\nThat came a month after Kushner convened an economic workshop in Bahrain that aired prospect of $50 billion in investment under a regional peace deal.\n\nBut the Palestinian Authority dismissed the \u201cPeace to Prosperity\u201d workshop, accusing the pro-Israel Trump of using the prospect of cash to try to impose political solutions.\n\nThis time the White House says Kushner is preparing to release an oft-delayed Mideast peace plan in which Saudi Arabia is expected to play a significant role. The White House has not said when Kushner will present the plan, but the official said it is not expected to happen during the upcoming visit.\n\nIsrael\u2019s post-election political paralysis has complicated Kushner\u2019s mission.\n\nNeither Netanyahu nor Gantz secured a parliamentary majority in the Sept. 17 election. Attempts at forming a unity government have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nAP contributed to this report", "description": "Jared Kushner is returning to the Middle East to refresh efforts for continued dialogue between\u00a0Saudi Arabia and Israel.", "authors": ["Simon Kent"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/Jared-Kushner-peace-plan-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
