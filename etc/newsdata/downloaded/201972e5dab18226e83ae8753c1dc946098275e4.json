Why should we expect anything else?\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Sudduth Coliseum on Oct. 11, 2019 in Lake Charles, Louisiana. (Photo: Matt Sullivan, Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump hasn\u2019t come across the mocked-up video of him on a murderous rampage against journalists and political opponents?\n\nHow absurd.\n\nThe president\u2019s press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said Monday morning that her boss hadn\u2019t seen the video widely circulated since Sunday but that \u201cbased upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video.\u201d\n\nRe: the video played over the weekend: The @POTUS@realDonaldTrump has not yet seen the video, he will see it shortly, but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video. \u2014 Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) October 14, 2019\n\nWhat a relief, right?\n\nIt\u2019s good to know the president at some point intends to censure the horrific video depicting him inside a church shooting journalists and political rivals like the late Sen. John McCain, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney.\n\nBut first he had more important things to tweet Monday morning, like urging Americans to vote for his former press aide Sean Spicer on \u201cDancing with the Stars.\u201d\n\nVote for good guy @seanspicer tonight on Dancing With The Stars. He has always been there for us! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\nIt increasingly feels futile to call on Trump, his core supporters and the conservatives who otherwise carry the Republican Party\u2019s moral torch to denounce evil.\n\nThey\u2019re simply tone-deaf, too worried about protecting their own fortunes, their elected gigs or too consumed helping Trump isolating this country from the rest of the world to burden themselves with a video that could incite violence against fellow Americans.\n\nYou need 'moral clarity' to see the evil in this\n\nBut this is no joke, and the rest of America should collectively denounce the grotesque video, which was reportedly produced in 2018 but shown last week at a Trump meeting at his Miami resort.\n\nThe video, reported by The New York Times over the weekend, shows a Trump-like figure inside a church striking McCain and journalists at a time when mass shootings in America are too real, too raw to stomach.\n\n\u201cThinking this video somehow will incite violence against media brands is no different than thinking Joker will lead to mass shootings or heavy metal music leads to satanic suicides or video games create mass shooters. It\u2019s a meme, and it\u2019s free speech,\u2019\u2019 said commentator Stephen Miller on Twitter.\n\nMcCain\u2019s daughter, Meghan McCain, shot back saying on Twitter: \u201cThis video is disgusting and disturbing and any human with any moral clarity sees that.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the thing, though. A human needs to have \u201cmoral clarity\u201d to see the evil of depicting the nation\u2019s commander-in-chief executing a mass shooting against fellow Americans.\n\nElvia D\u00edaz is an editorial columnist for The Republic and azcentral, where this column originally appeared.
