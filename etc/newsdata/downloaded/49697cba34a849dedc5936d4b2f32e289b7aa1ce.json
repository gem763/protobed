(Photo: Viewsonic)\n\nWith traffic on the rise in major cities and climate change top-of-mind, you might want to work more from home.\n\n\u201cTelecommuting\u201d (or \u201cteleworking\u201d) has been around since the 1980s, but it has taken off in recent years \u2013 thanks to technological tools like home PCs and reliable internet connectivity, which can keep employees connected via robust video and data networks.\n\nIn fact, roughly 40% of the U.S. workforce already works remotely in some fashion, according to research and consulting firm Global Workplace Analytics. Telecommuting runs the range from working one or two days at home per week to a full-time 40-hour telecommuting arrangement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a surge in the movement right now because devices and connections are more affordable than ever before \u2013 and thanks to smartphones and tablets, they have even been combined into a single, portable device that gives us all of the functionality that we used to have at a corporate desktop,\u201d says Laurel Farrer, founder of the Remote Work Association. \u201cSo now, our work is something we do (not somewhere we go) and our office is anywhere we already happen to be.\u201d\n\nSmall businesses: 8 easy steps to keeping your business safe and secure\n\nOn the job: Don't look now, but your boss is probably spying on your work phone or computer\n\nGiven that it\u2019s #WorkFromAnywhereWeek (Oct. 7-11) \u2013 an initiative promoting flexibility in the workplace, and supported by tech companies like Logitech, Microsoft, Lenovo, Zoom, BlueJeans, and others \u2013 let\u2019s examine the pros and cons of working from home: for the employee, the employer, and the environment.\n\nThe benefits of working at home\n\n\u2022 Employees: Staying at home paves the way for a better work-life balance. Many take their kids to and from school, spend less on professional attire and lunches (and eat healthier), and aren\u2019t distracted with colleagues asking for something (or being dragged into meetings they\u2019re not needed in). A Stanford University report, and a joint study by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Northwestern University, both found those who work from home are less stressed and more productive than those who work a 9-to-5 job out of the home.\n\n\u2022 Businesses: You can hire the best person for the job \u2013 even if they live across the country or around the world (barring any time zone challenges). Another advantage for employers: candidates who want to work from home may accept a lower salary than those who must commute to work. This isn\u2019t always the case, but you can compare salaries for the same positions -- in-house versus at-home -- at FlexJobs.com. As a cost-saving consideration, you don\u2019t have to pay for office space (and other related expenses) for an at-home worker. You might be able to close the deal over a video call instead of incurring the costs to fly cross-country. Those who work from home are often happier and more productive, which is good for company morale and efficiency.\n\n\u2022 The environment: Telecommuting can not only save time and money but also has an eco-advantage, too: fewer cars on the road reduces the amount of emissions that contribute to pollution and global warming. The more companies allow for telecommuting, the lighter the roads might be for those who must drive to the office \u2013 or take public transit, taxis or ride-share vehicles. In other words, everyone wins.\n\nTelecommuting's potential downsides\n\n\u2022 Employees: In the abovementioned survey, telecommuters said interpersonal relationships were missed while working at home. This includes having coffee or lunches with colleagues, smoke breaks, water-cooler gossip, collaborating on team projects, and perhaps after-work drinks. While it may sound appealing to work from home, many have trouble staying motivated without a supervisor or boss looking over their shoulder. Should you work on that sales report or take a break to watch \"Ellen\" or flick through Instagram? Juggling kids and remaining focused could also be a challenge.\n\n\u2022 Businesses: From a creativity standpoint, telecommuting could result in a loss of on-site brainstorming. And allowing some employees to work from home (and not others) could lead to lower office morale. There's also an increased security and privacy risk \u2013 not only could it be easier for a disgruntled at-home worker to wreak havoc, perhaps by stealing data, but accidental breaches can happen, too. Telecommuting might also complicate insurance policies and worker\u2019s compensation.\n\nGiven the advantages and challenges, a business interested in telecommuting must first determine whether it\u2019s practicable for employees to work from home \u2013 obviously, some positions aren\u2019t conducive for this option. And companies should assess whether each individual employee is self-motivated enough to be a good telecommuting worker. To that point, it might be a good idea for supervisors to draft specific expectation guidelines and have at-home workers sign the agreement before a move to telecommuting. Perhaps the supervisor and worker agree to a short trial to see if the arrangement works.\n\nFinally, remember that it doesn\u2019t have to be \u201call or none,\u201d as some businesses restrict at-home working to a day or two a week. That's a way for the employer and the employee to get the best of both worlds.\n\nFollow Marc on Twitter: @marc_saltzman.
