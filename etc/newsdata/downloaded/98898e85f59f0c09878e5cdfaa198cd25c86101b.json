So much of it had leaked that there were few surprises left, and on paper, the hardware lags behind some of its immediate competition. Even significantly cheaper phones like the OnePlus 7T have a clear advantage when it comes to specs per dollar.\n\nAnd yet, I\u2019m pretty sure the Pixel 4 will end up being my daily driver.\n\nFor one, the Pixel 4 looks much better in person than leaked renders would suggest. Granted, I\u2019ve always dug the two-tone look, but I also think this is the most refined Pixel Google has made.\n\nThe back glass has a slightly frosted, smooth texture to it that feels luxurious, while the edges are coated in a matte black paint that is actually a little grippy and helps the phone rest nicely in your hands. And that accent power button is always a nice touch.\n\nIt\u2019s a welcome change of pace from the color shiny gradients almost everyone else is doing while having a bit more pizzazz than Apple\u2019s monochrome frosted colorways. Looks are subjective, sure, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, this might actually be the best-looking phone of the year.\n\nOn the front, things are a little less remarkable, but still an overall improvement over the prior generation. Yes, there\u2019s a big forehead this time around to house that Soli radar and facial recognition hardware, but I\u2019ll take that over a notch. Moreover, the area above the screen isn\u2019t all that important when it comes to usability. Instead, Google has wisely shrunk the bottom bezel to a sliver, which makes the phones a bit easier to use in one hand.\n\nDoing so means sacrificing the front-facing position bottom speaker, but I still found the Pixel 4 sounded about as loud and clear as my Pixel 3XL.\n\nThe display now runs at a gorgeous 90Hz, and I never want to go back. This would be more remarkable if OnePlus hadn\u2019t beaten Google to the punch months ago \u2013 not to mention niche gamer phones \u2013 but it\u2019s still an awesome trend that I hope becomes the norm. The Pixel 4 feels incredibly smooth, but we\u2019ll have to see how that holds up in the long term.\n\nThe Pixel 4\u2018s coolest feature is its radar-powered Motion Sense technology, but it\u2019s also one of its most under-utilized. Right now, it\u2019s doesn\u2019t help with much more than swiping through songs, silencing alarms, and a waving at a Pikachu wallpaper.\n\nBut after a very small learning curve, it also works really well. It puts any other \u2018air gesture\u2019 system on a phone to shame. I can swipe through songs and videos with near-perfect consistency, so it\u2019s something I actually see myself using, even if current applications are limited. The sensor is also used to speed up face logins, which works faster than any device I\u2019ve tried and works from fairly odd angles. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll miss the fingerprint reader at all.\n\nAs usual though, the star of the show is the camera. Live HDR+ is a blessing, allowing you to preview what your final image will actually look like in the viewfinder, while the combination of a telephoto lens and Google\u2018s Super Res Zoom makes photos of distant subjects look nice and sharp.\n\nMy favorite feature is simply the ability to set overall exposure and shadow brightness separately. It\u2019s intuitive to use, and it opens up a world of creative options. It\u2019s a level of freedom few professional cameras offer, let alone smartphones.\n\nOn the other hand, the lack of an ultra-wide camera borders on inexcusable in a 2019 flagship. Google said it believed a telephoto lens would be more useful to more people, but that\u2019s a lame excuse when virtually every one of its competitors offers both a telephoto and an ultra-wide lens.\n\nBesides, the company basically made the same excuse about the tele lens last year before it relented this year. I\u2019m starting to worry Google likes to cripple itself with hardware that\u2019s a generation or two behind everyone else. How much do you want to bet the company will relent and add a that ultra-wide on the Pixel 5?\n\nStill, the Google\u2019s image processing \u2013 unmatched, in my book \u2013 makes it hard for me to consider anything else.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more for us to test in the coming days. We need to check out the improvements to Night Sight, test the battery, and see how performance holds up once loaded with apps. I\u2019m particularly concerned about how the 2,800 mAh battery capacity will hold up on the smaller device. The similarly sized S10, for example, uses a 3,400 mAh battery.\n\nWhile part of me feels like it\u2019s hard to justify the Pixel 4 when phones like the OnePlus 7T offer a lot more bang for your buck \u2013 and don\u2019t forget the Pixel 3a is still a fantastic deal \u2013 I left my hands-on feeling the and the Pixel 4 is more than the sum of its parts. Stay tuned for our full review soon.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FGoogle-Pixel-4-1-of-7.jpg&signature=8bdf978456d806fd8a8722f238afd677", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
