Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is making strides with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and is expected to meet with the group\u2019s fundraising arm, making her and Joe Biden the only Democrat 2020 candidates to do so, according to Axios.\n\nWarren is expected to meet with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) Bold PAC on Thursday, following what many consider to be a solid debate performance on Tuesday evening.\n\nAccording to Axios, much of the discussion will revolve around immigration reform \u2013 a topic that was virtually ignored at the CNN/New York Times-hosted Democrat debate in Westerville, Ohio.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure whoever the nominee is doesn\u2019t waffle on this,\u201d Bold PAC political director Gisel Aceves said, according to Axios.\n\n\u201cOur members are acutely aware of how important and consequential this election is obviously to the country, but also how the Hispanic community has been attacked by this administration,\u201d Aceves added.\n\nWhile some of the 38 CHC Bold PAC members have endorsed a 2020 candidate, the caucus as a whole has not. The fundraising wing has only met with one other candidate: former vice president Joe Biden. He reportedly met with the CHC Bold PAC during the summer, around the same time he was dominating national polls. However, the political landscape has drastically shifted since their meeting in July, with Warren steadily making her way to the top and leading Biden in several national and early primary and caucus state polls.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator has broadly outlined her vision for immigration reform, expressing support for a full open borders policy at the U.S.-Mexico border and vowing in a tweet this month to stop \u201cunnecessarily\u201d detaining illegal border crossers:\n\nToo many immigrants have died in ICE custody. We need to ensure asylum seekers are welcomed, treated humanely, receive the medical care they need, and are not detained unnecessarily. I have a plan to rebuild a more humane immigration system. https://t.co/v3OZZHeGPd \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 3, 2019\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nWarren\u2019s statement came in response to a report that a Cameroon national detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency had died while in custody. Unmentioned, though, is that migrant deaths under the Trump administration are 20 percent lower than the rate of migrant deaths under former President Obama.\n\nWarren\u2019s essential call for open borders follows the speech she delivered to the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union in September. She, inexplicably, told union members that granting amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants currently residing in the United States would be \u201cgood for all workers,\u201d even though the move would \u201cimmediately drive up foreign competition in the labor market for America\u2019s working and blue-collar class,\u201d as Breitbart News noted.\n\n\u201cWe need a pathway to citizenship for the people who are here and here to stay. They are our neighbors; they are our brothers and sisters. They are here,\u201d Warren said during the speech.\n\n\u201cWe need a path \u2014 not just for DREAMers \u2014 but also a path for grandmas, and for little kids, and for people who came here to work on farms, and for students who overstayed their visas. We need a path that is fair and achievable. Bring people out of the shadows,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cIt is good for all workers, and we need to get them into our unions,\u201d she added.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren is making strides with the\u00a0Congressional Hispanic Caucus and is expected to meet with the group's fundraising arm.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/GettyImages-1153098916-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
