No pie. Good bye #GBBO.\u2019\n\n\u2018Topless pies? No no no that\u2019s not a pie #GBBO,\u2019 another commented.\n\nA viewer screamed: \u2018FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DAVID \u2013 PUT A LID ON YOUR BLOODY PIE! PLEASE! #gbbo.\u2019\n\nWhile another fumed: \u2018AN OPEN PIE IS A TART, NOT A PIE #GBBO.\u2019\n\nAnd Paul Hollywood got the ultimate dig in there, adding that David\u2019s three-pie pie needed a lattice roof to enclose it.\n\n\u2018The design is very good,\u2019 the judge told him.\n\n\u2018The exposed veg I don\u2019t really like. It needs to be more of a latticing to enclose it for me.\u2019\n\nLuckily, David\u2019s lidless pie wasn\u2019t a total travesty, with Henry eventually going home instead.\n\nBut a warning for next time, always put a top on your pie\u2026\n\nGreat British Bake Off continues on Tuesdays, at 8pm, on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
