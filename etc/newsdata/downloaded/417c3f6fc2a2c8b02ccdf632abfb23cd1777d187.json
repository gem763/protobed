It was then leaked to the media.\n\nPope Francis said the leak harmed the principle of presumption of innocence.\n\nThe memo was \"prejudicial to the dignity of the people involved\" and to the image of the police, a statement from the Holy See's press office said.\n\nMr Giani had \"no personal responsibility\" in the affair, the statement added.\n\nIt said the Pope had shown appreciation for Mr Giani's \"unquestionable faithfulness and loyalty\", \"extreme competence\" and \"undisputed professionalism\".\n\nWhat is the scandal about?\n\nOn 1 October, Vatican police raided the offices of the Holy See's Secretariat of State and its Financial Information Authority (AIF).\n\nThe raid was attempting to find evidence for suspected financial wrongdoing.\n\nAccording to The Financial Times, the investigation centred on $200m (\u00a3160m; \u20ac180m) in Swiss bank accounts controlled by the Vatican which had been used to finance a luxury property development in the London district of Chelsea, and which had resulted in huge profit for the original seller.\n\nThe Holy See's Secretariat of State is in control of millions of dollars donated by Catholics across the world.\n\nThe Vatican has declined to comment on its ownership of the building.\n\nWhat was in the memo?\n\nThe day after the raid, a memo bearing photos of the five employees supposedly suspected of involvement in the scandal was distributed internally to Vatican security staff.\n\nThe memo said the five employees were \"preventatively suspended\" and barred from the Vatican, despite not being properly investigated.\n\nIt is unclear who sent the memo to the Italian newspaper L'Espresso.\n\nThe Pope described the leak as comparable to a \"mortal sin\" and ordered an investigation, saying it harmed personal dignity and the principle of presumption of innocence.\n\nWho is Domenico Giani?\n\nMr Giani, 57, has worked for the Vatican police force for two decades.\n\nMr Giani was previously in Italy's secret service and in 2006 was named director of Vatican security services.\n\nHe has frequently been pictured assisting Pope Francis at events, trips and outings.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Giani is often pictured by Pope Francis' side\n\nIn an interview with Vatican News, he said \"recent events have caused the Holy Father great sorrow\" and this had deeply affected him.\n\nThe release of the document had \"certainly trampled the dignity of these people,\" he said, and he was ashamed of the suffering caused.", "description": "Domenico Giani had \"no responsibility\" for the leak but resigned out of \"love\", the Holy See said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/174B5/production/_109231459_pope3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
