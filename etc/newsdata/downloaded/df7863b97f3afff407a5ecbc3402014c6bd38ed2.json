Lynn Winmill overturned a lower court decision in favor of the Morrises that had awarded them $75,000 last October in their 2014 lawsuit.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs are permanently enjoined \u2026 from hosting a Christmas Program of the magnitude of the program they presented in 2015 and 2016,\u201d Judge Winmill wrote.\n\nThe Morrises in 2014 filed a lawsuit against West Hayden Estates First Addition Homeowner\u2019s Association, which had opposed the couple\u2019s purchase of their home and their Christmas program, which featured more than 200,000 lights.\n\nThe homeowner\u2019s association countersued, saying the live camel violated livestock rules and accusing Mr. Morris of collecting $6,000 in charitable fundraising for his business. It also expressed concern for neighbors who were non-Christians or \u201cof another faith.\u201d\n\nThe lower court ruled against the HOA, saying it had bullied the Morrises over their faith.\n\nThe Morrises did not hold a Christmas program in 2017 or 2018.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
