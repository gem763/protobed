But if there's no further escalation in the upcoming meeting, markets will be relieved,\" he added.\n\nChina and the United States are due to resume high-level trade talks next week in Washington.\n\nWhile the tussle over trade and technology between the world's two largest economies has intensified, some investors are sticking to hopes of a compromise.\n\nA tentative deal could be reached by the end of this year considering the President Donald Trump's administration would strive to avoid the U.S. economy falling into a recession in an election year, they say.\n\n\"While we ought not to have preconception, for Trump, not having made a deal with China could be increasingly seen as negative ahead of the election next year,\" said Tomoo Kinoshita, chief global strategist at Invesco Asset Management in Tokyo.\n\nIn the currency market, the euro extended its decline on worries about sluggish growth in the currency bloc.\n\nThe euro traded at $1.0897 , having slipped to a near 2 1/2-year low of $1.0885 in U.S. trade on Monday.\n\nThe yen was barely changed at 108.08 yen to the dollar , not far from last month's low of 108.48.\n\nThe Japanese currency showed no reaction to the Bank of Japan's tankan survey showing business confidence at big Japanese manufacturers worsened in the three months to September to its lowest level in six years. Australian dollar fetched $0.6755 AUD=D4 , near three-week low of $0.6739 touched last month ahead of a likely rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia later in the day.\n\nA majority of 35 economists polled by Reuters expect the RBA to cut the cash rate for the third time this year.\n\nOil prices were under pressure, wiping out all of their gains after attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities last month, on fading concerns of supply shortfalls and conflicts in the Middle East.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 3.3% on Monday before rise 0.39% early on Tuesday to $54.28 per barrel.\n\n(Editing by Richard Borsuk)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Global shares steady, investors pin hopes on U.S.-China talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6U08A_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
