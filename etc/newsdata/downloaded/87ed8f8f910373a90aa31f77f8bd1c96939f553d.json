They kept asking if I was a wrestler.\"", "description": "Wacey Foster has had fans of Roald Dahl's classic Matilda in stitches with his costume of the tyrannical, child-throwing principal", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Joe Mcfarlane"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20758513.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-CATERS_MISS_TRUNCHBALL_07jpeg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
