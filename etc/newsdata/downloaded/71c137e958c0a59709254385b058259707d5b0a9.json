This year has been a dream come true,\" Andreescu said after the match, calling Williams a \"true legend of this sport.\"\n\nBut she joked that while Williams was a formidable opponent, her biggest obstacle to victory was the crowd, which was firmly in Williams' camp.\n\nRobert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\"I know you guys wanted Serena to win, so I'm so sorry,\" she said with a laugh.\n\n\"I\u2019ve dreamt of this moment for a really long time but I never thought it would come this soon,\u201d Andreescu told ABC News after her victory. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely been one of my dreams to play her and so it was just a really good opportunity for me. I just went out there, I played my game. The goal was to make her work for every shot and I think that\u2019s what I did really well. I try not to feel intimidated at all. And I just try not to focus on who\u2019s on the other side.\u201d\n\nAndreescu admitted that the crowd was something that she had to deal with throughout the entire match.\n\n\"I mean it\u2019s really tough when they\u2019re really really loud but it was expected so I just went out there and try not to focus on it and I think I did a really good job at just staying very calm,\u201d she said.\n\nWilliams, who was vying for a record-tying 24th Grand Slam title and her first since giving birth to daughter Olympia two years ago, applauded Andreescu for playing an \"unbelievable match.\"\n\n\"I'm just so proud that I'm still out here and competing at this level because it's not easy to be in this particular sport for 20 years,\" Williams said.\n\nShe thanked her team for helping her through the ups and, lately, the \"downs and downs and downs and downs and downs.\" But Williams added, \"Hopefully, we'll have some ups soon!\"\n\nJUSTIN LANE/EPA-EFE/REX\n\nAnd she expressed gratitude to the fans.\n\n\"Honestly, the fans started cheering so hard... I was really grateful for that,\" Williams said.\n\nAmong those in the stands was Williams' close friend Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, who took a last-minute flight from London. Meghan was seated between Patrick Mouratoglou, Serena\u2019s coach, and Serena\u2019s mother Oracene Price, at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows, New York.\n\nMeghan and Williams have been friends since meeting at the 2010 Super Bowl in Miami.\n\nWilliams was ranked No. 1 in the world when she went on maternity leave but has not won a Grand Slam since giving birth to her daughter in 2017.\n\nAfter Williams spoke out about the unfairness of women players being penalized because of maternity leave, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) changed its rules to add more protections for moms on the tour.\n\nWilliams lost last year's U.S. Open in a tense and controversial match against Naomi Osaka. More recently, she made it to this year's Wimbledon final in July but lost in straight sets to seventh-seed Simona Halep.\n\nThe night, however, belonged to Andreescu and she relished the moment.\n\n\"Having Canada\u2019s support ... means so much to me. So all I can say is that I\u2019m very grateful for it but I\u2019m not done yet so let\u2019s keep it going,\" she told ABC News.\n\nWhen asked about how she was going to celebrate her victory, she told ABC News, \u201cI haven\u2019t really thought about that. I\u2019ll probably have a really good dinner with my team and then we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d\n\nABC News' Joshua Hoyos, Katie Kindelan and Matt Claiborne contributed to this report.", "description": "Serena Williams' victory at the U.S. Open is her first Grand Slam win since giving birth to baby Olympia.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/andreesc-01-as-gty-190907_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
