Between that government position and Tommy\u2019s strategic relationship with Oswald Mosley (Sam Claflin), the real-life right-wing founder of the British Union of Fascists, it\u2019s hard not to feel like writer/creator Steven Knight\u2019s hit series is now fully operating with one foot in the grimy 1930s past and one in the all-too-real present\u2014an impression to which Knight responds with a knowing smile and faux-surprise, \u201cHow could that possibly be?\u201d\n\nPeaky Blinders has always melded fiction and history, and that combination is more explosive than ever in its latest outing, which is now streaming on Netflix after its triumphant broadcast run in its native England, where it\u2019s a phenomenon that star Murphy describes, correctly, as \u201czeitgeisty.\u201d With Tommy amongst the country\u2019s political elite, and yet struggling to keep his criminal enterprise afloat after losing the family fortune in the Wall Street crash of 1929, the show takes direct aim at the here-and-now, both in its portrait of government as a den of thieves and in its examination of fascism\u2019s ascension in an apparently staunch democracy. The latter comes via Mosley, a debonair hatemonger whose dogma will sound eerily familiar to anyone paying attention to current events.\n\nAlongside Murphy in New York City, and over pints rather than hard-drinking Tommy\u2019s favored Irish whiskey (astonishingly, Murphy claims he\u2019s a \u201clightweight\u201d who can\u2019t stomach the stuff), the prolific Knight explains, \u201cWe typically jump forward two to three years [each season], so suddenly we were into the \u201830s. Lucky for Peaky, and unluckily for the world, there are huge resonances between what was happening in the early \u201830s and what is happening now, in terms of nationalism, populism, racism.\u201d Since Mosley\u2019s constituency was located right next door to Tommy\u2019s Birmingham enclave, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like history and fate were pointing this out to us.\u201d Researching Mosley only further cemented his relevance, given that, as Knight recalls, \u201cI\u2019m finding his real speeches, in which he talks about \u2018false news.\u2019 That was really there; it\u2019s not me making it up. And his slogan was \u2018Britain First.\u2019 So make of that what you will.\u201d\n\nFocused on an underworld gang that thrived during the initial decades of the 20th century and got its distinctive name from the razor blade-outfitted hats worn by its members, Peaky Blinders\u2014set to guitar-driven tunes from the likes of Nick Cave and PJ Harvey\u2014is the story of the Shelby family, led by Tommy, a man torn between the angel and devil on his respective shoulders. Think of him as an antihero in a Tony Soprano or Walter White mold, and therefore the beneficiary of a TV landscape that\u2019s become increasingly attracted to his ilk. Tommy\u2019s appeal comes from the fact that, on the one hand, he\u2019s a larger-than-life criminal\u2014\u201ca good man\u2019s life would be a very tedious thing to watch over 30 hours!\u201d Murphy laughs. And yet at the same time, as the head of a household responsible for both his immediate family and the relatives with whom he\u2019s in illicit business, he\u2019s also a character with intensely relatable concerns.\n\n\u201cIf you wrote down what Tommy is, people would go, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t want to spend time with that guy,\u2019\u201d admits Murphy, the charismatic 43-year-old Irish actor best known stateside for 28 Days Later and his work in various Christopher Nolan films. \u201cBut if you imbue him with some of the normal weakness and frailties that we all walk around with, people will identify with that, even though it\u2019s magnified through the prism of a gangster vernacular. He\u2019s still recognizably human\u2014he\u2019s a dad struggling with his children; he\u2019s a husband struggling with a wife; he\u2019s a man struggling with middle age and being materially satisfied. All those things are resonant.\u201d\n\nCredit for Tommy\u2019s ne\u2019er-do-well allure is split evenly between Knight\u2019s nuanced scripting (\u201camazing writing,\u201d per Murphy) and the star\u2019s magnetic performance, which doesn\u2019t shy away from Tommy\u2019s more explicit and ugly behavior while simultaneously digging deeply into his stew of issues. In Season 5, Tommy is consumed with the idea that people are coming for his \u201ccrown.\u201d That paranoia is justified by the new threats encircling him, as well as a symptom of his WWI military trauma, which has left him with severe PTSD and compels him to view every aspect of his violent life in wartime terms.\n\nFortunately for Tommy, the political arena in which he finds himself is not very different from the battlefield or the kill-or-be-killed streets of Birmingham. \u201cThrough amassing all that wealth and moving up and being accepted, as a sort of novelty, into the aristocratic establishment, he comes to realize that they\u2019re no better than him,\u201d Murphy surmises. \u201cThere\u2019s a great line in series five when someone asks him, \u2018What are politics like?\u2019 and he says, \u2018Gangs, wars and truces\u2014nothing I didn\u2019t already know.\u2019 That\u2019s what politics are. So he\u2019s perfectly matched for that world.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Mosley proves a novel challenge for Tommy. Offering a partnership that will give the gangster everything he ever dreamed, he\u2019s an ideological demon proposing a Faustian bargain. Consequently, Knight sees him as a perfect vehicle for Tommy\u2019s evolution, since the showrunner envisions Peaky Blinders as, ultimately, a story rooted in the question, \u201cCan this man escape from his roots, and can we redeem a man who appears to be, on the surface, a bad man? By chance, this is a period of history when these circumstances may awaken a moral sensibility, because of the scale and the nature of what\u2019s being confronted.\u201d Tommy\u2019s decision to champion socialist causes, and then to get into bed with Mosley\u2019s fascist movement, are thus developments pushing him toward a reckoning with his own amorality.\n\n\u201c The other fundamental question of the series is whether you can escape where you came from. It\u2019s a different question in the States compared to in the UK, because I think in the States, it has more to do with money. \u201d\n\n\u201cI think the whole arc of the character is reawakening,\u201d Knight elucidates, and Murphy agrees wholeheartedly. \u201cI imagine he was this quite idealistic, definitely left-leaning individual, and he went to the First World War and saw this destruction on a scale that we can\u2019t even begin to comprehend, and saw how people supposedly in charge were actually cowards, and therefore came back without any faith in any political system or philosophy.\u201d Now faced with fascism, he\u2019s come to understand that, \u201cMaybe I was onto something! Maybe these feelings that I\u2019ve suppressed are actually correct. I think he\u2019s always had them. So I think we\u2019re beginning, very, very slowly, to see more of that pre-WWI Tommy.\u201d\n\nAs is the case with his wild-man brother Arthur (Paul Anderson), his tough-as-nails aunt Penny (Helen McCrory), his disapproving sister Ada (Sophie Rundle) and his scheming nephew Michael (Finn Cole)\u2014who, in Season 5, returns from the States with conniving new bride Gina (Anya Taylor-Joy) in tow\u2014Tommy\u2019s struggle to transform himself is also rooted in the issue of his birthplace. \u201cThe other fundamental question of the series is whether you can escape where you came from,\u201d opines Knight. \u201cIt\u2019s a different question in the States compared to in the U.K., because I think in the States, it has more to do with money. Tommy has been able to accumulate a lot of money, and have a big house. But in the U.K., that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not the same person you were. You carry your class on your tongue.\u201d\n\nBesieged by anxieties and adversaries, it\u2019s no wonder that Tommy is more on-edge than ever before. In reading about middle-aged men, Murphy discovered that, \u201cstatistically, the men who commit suicide in middle age are generally the men who\u2019ve achieved a huge amount, are materially stable, and are leaders in their communities.\u201d Between lying awake at night wondering what\u2019s next, and smoking opium to cope with his numerous problems, \u201che\u2019s clearly headed for, at least, a serious nervous breakdown, if not worse.\u201d\n\nTommy\u2019s path is both upwards into the highest echelons of society and into the lowest pits of despair and madness. His final fate, though, is left unanswered by the latest cliffhanger finale, in part because Knight hasn\u2019t settled on it yet. \u201cWith Peaky, you never know yourself. When I start writing, to not know what\u2019s going to happen next is a blessing, because then when you write, you realize that in this moment, I can just do that, and it\u2019s going to come out of nowhere and no one\u2019s expecting it because I wasn\u2019t expecting it. I\u2019ve tried to maintain that spirit throughout the whole thing.\u201d That approach is born out by a raft of surprise reappearances from former players in Season 5, some of whom are merely byproducts of Tommy\u2019s drug-addled hallucinations, and others who\u2026well, let\u2019s just say that not every deceased fan favorite is actually in the grave.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve tried to do [in the series] is throw Tommy Shelby and family into these explosions of history\u2014the general strike, the stock market crash, and the coming fascism\u2014and then ask myself how Tommy would respond,\u201d Knight says. While his current plan is to end the show after two more seasons, Knight is leaving the door open for more Shelby adventures, confessing, \u201cWe\u2019ll get to the second World War, and then we\u2019ll see where we go from there. Because the energy for this thing is so strong\u2014it\u2019s just getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and I don\u2019t want to not utilize that energy.\u201d\n\nMurphy is more than game to follow wherever Knight takes him, given that Peaky Blinders has struck that sweet spot between exciting and unpredictable genre saga and intimate character study. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to be the best versions of ourselves, and we\u2019re all walking around with these desires and contradictions and these things we\u2019re trying to suppress. That\u2019s part of the reason they [audiences] dig it. It\u2019s because it\u2019s not reality; it\u2019s heightened. It\u2019s a fucking gangster show but there\u2019s so much that is universal about it.\u201d\n\nContinuing onward, however, does mean the actor will have to keep sporting Tommy\u2019s trademark hairstyle\u2014a shaved-around-the-sides \u2018do that, he recounts, was actually a last-second spark of inspiration from his director and makeup designer. \u201cAll of a sudden, the Peakys have this really graphic silhouette, which we never anticipated. The caps were all in it, and the suits, very specifically. But the haircut was never in it\u2014and then all of a sudden, this disgusting haircut, which was so graphic. And now people go and get it!\u201d\n\nConfirming that popularity, Knight points out that, in the last week alone, four British children have been kicked out of school for sporting the Peakys\u2019 signature coiffure (including this boy in Carlisle)\u2014which may, in the end, be the most conclusive proof yet that Tommy Shelby and company have truly gone mainstream.", "description": "The hit series\u2019 creator Steven Knight and star Cillian Murphy open up about the stunning fifth season of the U.K. gangster saga\u2014one that eerily echoes our current nightmare.", "authors": ["Nick Schager"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570222014/191002-schager-peaky-tease_ckrzbe", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
