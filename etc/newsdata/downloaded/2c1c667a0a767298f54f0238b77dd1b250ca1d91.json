But now, at 51 years old, with blood vessels cut off and her facial tissue darkening and dying, Tarleton\u2019s immune system is fully rejecting her face.\n\nThat has forced her to confront two arduous possibilities: Receive another new face, or if her tissue rapidly fails, undergo reconstruction of her original face \u2014 and return to her disfigurement she left behind six years ago.\n\n\u201cWe all know we are in uncharted waters,\u201d she told the Boston Globe. \u201cI would rather not have to go through a catastrophic failure.\u2019\u2019\n\nTransplanted organs, like kidneys, hearts and lungs, typically have a limited life span in their new bodies. But doctors caution that the field of face transplants is still experimental, with no long-term studies or risk assessments to guide surgeons in a procedure only conducted about 40 times worldwide, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cThere are so many unknowns and so many new things we are discovering,\u2019\u2019 Bohdan Pomahac, director of plastic surgery transplantation at Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and one of Tarleton\u2019s surgeons, told the Globe. \u201cIt\u2019s really not realistic to hope faces are going to last [the patient\u2019s] lifetime.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe was \u2018perfectly healthy\u2019 before the mosquito bite. Nine days later, he was brain dead.\n\nBrian Gastman, a transplant surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic who led the first U.S. face transplant in 2008, told the Globe that more face transplants are failing in the years since the procedure was first performed. \u201cWe all believe every patient will likely need a re-transplant\u201d at some point, he said.\n\nNo face transplant patients in the United States have lost their donated faces, the AP reported, though a man in France received a second transplant after his body rejected his first.\n\nTarleton has been outspoken about her attack and recovery that began hours after her estranged husband beat her with a baseball bat and doused her body with lye, which burned 80 percent of her body and left her legally blind.\n\nShe endured nearly 40 surgeries in three months, the Globe reported. Dozens of blood transfusions shocked her immune system, and when she received a donor\u2019s neck and face skin, nose, lips and a bundle of muscles, nerves and arteries, her new face bombarded her immune system.\n\nHer physicians devised a dangerous solution: Shut down her immune system to give her new face a chance but leaving her in danger of infection.\n\nA boy\u2019s basketball-size tumor was slowly killing him. He died days after doctors removed it.\n\nIt worked, and she has been able to move forward with her life. It now includes grandchildren.\n\nBut now she awaits a decision on whether to proceed with another transplant or go back to her disfigured face. Her physicians are encouraged by her recovered immune system. But other issues have arisen. Her synthetic cornea failed, leaving her almost entirely blind. She applied for a guide dog.\n\n\u201cThese are not common things to go wrong, but when things go wrong you have to deal with it,\u2019\u2019 she told the Globe. \u201cl will get back to where I was. How, I don\u2019t know. I will get through this.\u2019\u2019\n\nStill, the transplant has relieved great pain for Tarleton, who suffered from neck scars that made it difficult to move her head. She tapered off her painkiller medication a year after the transplant. In the years since, she wrote a memoir and plucks a banjo.\n\nShe also spends time at her piano, where she belts out songs like The Eagles\u2019 classic \u201cDesperado,\u201d uncertain of which face will greet her grandchildren in the future.\n\nRead more:\n\nA gunshot destroyed her face. A rare surgery just gave her a new one.\n\nAs off-label use spreads for lifesaving niche drugs, supplies grow scarce, leaving patients in the lurch\n\nNearly 100 doctors have tried to diagnose this man\u2019s devastating illness \u2014 without success", "description": "\u201cWe all know we are in uncharted waters,\u201d Carmen Blandin Tarleton said. \u201cI would rather not have to go through a catastrophic failure.\u2019\u2019", "authors": ["Alex Horton", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/66JKZQG6AII6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
