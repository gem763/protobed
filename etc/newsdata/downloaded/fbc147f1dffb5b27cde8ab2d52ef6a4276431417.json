The Fed's next meeting is Sept. 18.\n\n\"The Fed futures markets are pricing in between 2-3 cuts this year. Similarly, the ECB is expected to cut rates in September and restart their QE program,\" said Maneesh Deshpande, U.S. Equity Strategist at Barclays.\n\nAs central banks cut interest rates, Mexico's policymakers still have room to lower borrowing costs by as much as 100 basis points before the peso becomes less attractive than other currencies, fund managers and financial analysts say.
