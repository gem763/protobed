Cowell gathered the ball outside the 22 and sidestepped two defenders before spinning around the final would-be tackler to dot down in the corner.\n\n\"I don\u2019t need to flip in rugby but the finishing ability, the power going into contact and the control of your limbs is related,\" she says.\n\nThe 23-year-old won gold in tumbling at the Junior World Championships in 2013 before competing in the World Championships in 2014. \"I fell out of love with gymnastics. The transition of changing clubs meant I ended up not enjoying it. Tumbling isn\u2019t in the Olympics so there was nowhere to go except the World Championships and I had already done that.\"\n\nCowell was no stranger to rugby when she decided to give it a go at Birmingham University in 2015, going on to represent Worcester in her final year. A native of Twickenham, rugby had been an ever-present backdrop. Little did she know it was going to become centre stage. Following the completion of her degree in mathematics and sport science, a return to London beckoned.", "description": "Few can claim to have represented Great Britain at a World Championships, be a junior world champion tumbler and a star of Harlequins rugby.", "authors": ["Jake Goodwill"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-union/2019/10/18/213347154_John-Nguyen-JNVisuals_Heather-Cowell-former-GB-junior-gymnast-London-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDiDrV97xgDFjc_F6AHtCzZ1iYpTXyY2WDbcUsYLdN5Q.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
