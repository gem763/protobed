Are they f****** joking. Three weeks and three people of colour gone. Souleyman was not the one to blame. Apprentice, Alan Sugar is 100 per cent racist!', one wrote.\n\nAnother said: 'Okay, I called Lord Sugar a racist as a joke last week but after this week, am I sure I'm joking?'.\n\n'Isn't it weird that the only three minorities in the process got fired in the first three weeks? Won't watch anymore! Unconscious racism much?,' a third added.\n\nHowever many viewers suggested that race had nothing to do with Lord Sugar's decision\n\nThe inaugural episode of the new season of The Apprentice saw chartered engineer Shahin Hassan, 36, axed from the show.\n\nIce-cream manufacturer Kenna Ngoma, 24, was given his marching orders by Lord Sugar during the second episode after a task to create unique and premium ice-lollies became his downfall.\n\nDespite all three of the candidates being from a BAME background, many viewers suggested that race had nothing to do with Lord Sugar's decision.\n\nLord Sugar tweeted this picture of the Senegal team, edited to include handbags and sunglasses laid out on sheets last year.
