Trump knows that\u2019s perfectly normal.", "language": "en", "text": "But as reports came out that Trump had used the call to pressure Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, Trump started suggesting, instead, that the complaint itself was the problem \u2014 that an American \u201cspy\u201d might have been \u201csecretly listening in,\u201d and asking whether the whistleblower \u201cis on our Country\u2019s side.\u201d\n\nTrump was right the first time. I would know, because I used to be one of those \u201cmany people listening in.\u201d As a former intelligence officer who used to be detailed to the White House Situation Room, I listened to more of President Barack Obama\u2019s calls with world leaders than I can remember. I would often joke with friends during this period of my life about trying to make small talk with German Chancellor Angela Merkel while she waited for Obama to come to the line. More somberly, I remember speaking with Zelensky\u2019s predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, moments after he learned of the downing of the MH-17 passenger plane in Ukraine in the early days of his government. It was a nerve-racking part of the job and one that couldn\u2019t be outsourced to hold music.\n\nFar from \u201cspying\u201d on the president, I was doing precisely the job that he and his senior advisers asked of me and my colleagues. While we don\u2019t yet know exactly how the current whistleblower may have come to know the contents of the Zelensky call, these calls are, in Trump\u2019s own words \u201cheavily populated.\u201d He authorizes them to be so, as does every president \u2014 and for good reasons.\n\nI was in the CIA. We wouldn't trust a country whose leader did what Trump did.\n\nIn the basement of the West Wing, the White House Situation Room is staffed by midcareer professionals from the intelligence community, State Department and military. It is often referred to as the nerve center of the federal government, the conduit through which information flows from national security agencies (and increasingly all other agencies, as well) to the president and his aides. In addition to vast amounts of intelligence reporting, the Situation Room is tasked with managing communications between the president and other heads of state. The vice president and the national security adviser also use the communication capabilities of the Situation Room extensively.\n\nHead of state calls are logistically complex. A typical call originates at the request of the president or national security adviser. Since the president doesn\u2019t tote around a phone book or have a speed-dial panel for foreign governments, the actual numbers and contact procedures are preserved across administrations by the staff of the Situation Room. These personnel set up the lines and conference-in the appropriate advisers authorized to listen in on the call. Some calls are treated more securely than others. For instance, very few people were read into Obama\u2019s historic call with Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba until the day it happened because of the sensitivity of the diplomatic efforts. The media wasn\u2019t notified until the following day.\n\nThe list of who is authorized to listen to a call is dynamic depending on the topic and typically includes the National Security Council senior director and relevant staff for the region or subject matter, as well as the national security adviser and deputies. Many of these advisers will sit with the president in the Oval Office, along with a Situation Room staffer who will operate the phones. More often than not, verbatim transcripts of these calls are made at the request of the national security adviser. He or she controls the dissemination of these transcripts within the government. The process I describe is followed, with minor modifications, anywhere the president physically may be.\n\nThe U.S. has no rules for when the president is a national security threat\n\nWhat happens when a transcript is not requested? Advisers in the room still usually make notes to follow up on action items. And you\u2019d be surprised at how unreliable the phone lines are. Situation Room personnel often have to stay on the line for the entire call to be able to reconnect the leaders instantly in the event of a dropped call. Even without a transcript, there are many people who would be privy to the contents of a call, and this circle of access is much wider than you might initially suspect. In my experience, it was not uncommon for a head of state call to consume the time of 10 people, all creating paper trails subject to the Presidential Records Act.\n\nTrump has authorized the release of the rough transcript of his call with Zelensky. While some may be skeptical that a record released by the White House will be complete, never once in my experience was such a document edited to remove politically damaging or even personally embarrassing comments. To the contrary, it was critical that a full record be made to ensure that relationships and policies developed during these calls could be advanced by the president\u2019s team and other parts of the federal government. Foreign policy is bigger than any one person, even the president.\n\nTrump and others in his orbit must all be well aware that there is nothing inherently nefarious about an intelligence officer knowing what the president said on the phone. It is, in fact, the norm. What is far from normal is the fact that one of these officers heard something so disturbing that he or she risked their entire career to become a whistleblower. And what\u2019s sadly becoming increasingly normal is that Trump is willing to attack any individual or institution that challenges his behavior as \u201cpartisan\u201d or part of some \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy. It has become this administration\u2019s reflex.\n\nI heard a lot on the phones at the White House \u2014 some of it hilarious and a lot of it deadly serious. I never once heard something, however, that made me consider becoming a whistleblower and telling others about the call. Whistleblower complaints in the intelligence world are rare, and the potential consequences for the employee testing the system are high. While there is much we still don\u2019t know about the complaint, we do know that the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general found that the subject matter \u201crelates to one of the most significant and important of the DNI\u2019s responsibilities to the American people.\u201d This compels us all to take the complaint seriously \u2014 and to treat the administration\u2019s self-interested attempts at obfuscation and playing the victim with a great deal of skepticism.\n\nRead more:\n\nCIA officers learn to keep quiet.
