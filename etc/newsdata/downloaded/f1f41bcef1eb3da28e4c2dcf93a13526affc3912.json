Seeing the numbers in black and white is a powerful motivator for change.\n\nPeople protest that they have unusual expenses that month. Yet this retro technique will spark creative financial improvements \u2014 no matter the month.\n\nAt a time when 25% of Americans do not have any retirement savings and most do not have $400 saved for emergencies, taking the time to write down a $3 parking fee may seem paltry and silly. However, this small change goes a long way in improving your financial choices.\n\nMy client Marianne struggled to figure out why she why she couldn\u2019t shake off credit-card debt She had a good salary, travelled somewhere warm once a year but was not extravagant. She wanted to save for the future but always felt poor and debt-ridden.\n\nI asked her to write down what she spent over the coming month. At the next meeting we reviewed her spending. No judgment, no comments, just the numbers she had written down. We put everything in a category, such as eating out, groceries, coffee, entertainment, clothes, rent and gas. Next, I totaled the numbers. Marianne looked it over and said, \u201cThat looks about right.\u201d\n\nFrom her monthly pay stub, I wrote down her income. I subtracted the spending from the income and there it was: $495 in the hole. Without a comment, I turned the paper toward her. She was stunned. \u201cI overspend!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cEvery single month like this! No wonder I have credit-card debt.\u201d\n\nMarianne agreed to leave her credit card at home and mostly use cash. She committed to getting out of debt. She had a few sidesteps along the way, but always returned to her plan. She made small changes: shopping less, returning more impulse purchases and eating at home regularly. A decade later, she owned her own home and had built a nest egg for retirement.\n\nDespite my urging to view their spending in black and white, one young couple protested. \u201cAll our information is online. We know how much we spend,\u201d they said. I begged to differ, repeatedly explaining categories are lumped together and how the money was being spent was not totally transparent. Finally, after several meetings focused on improving their stressful financial communications, I asked them to \u201chumor\u201d me.\n\nThey reluctantly went retro and quickly discovered why the minutiae mattered. Every morning they each spent $7 on coffee. Seeing this financial fact in black and white changed their behavior. They decided to buy a beautiful higher-end coffee maker for home and two travel mugs. Their bank balance quickly revealed the behavior change.\n\nThe couple then went a step further and created a separate checking account \u2014 for rent, utilities and their cay payment. Then they each took a fixed amount monthly from their original checking account and made joint spending decisions with the balance. With this solid tracking information, they lived in real financial time. They became so excited by their new understanding and felt empowered around money.\n\nTaking the effort to write down what you spend is an emotional task as well as an operational activity. Financial issues sometimes cover earlier traumas or mental health issues. If your unease around this goes beyond \u201cmath anxiety\u201d or you feel paralyzed, you may need to explore further with a financial planner or a financial therapist. Your finances will thank you many times over.\n\nWhy is the simple act of writing down spending so powerful, even more powerful than tracking spending on an app? MRI testing has proven that writing by hand creates a stronger connection. The cognitive connection results in deeper processing and improved retention of information.\n\nTry it. Carry a pen and paper in your wallet for a week or, better yet, a month. As you spend, write down on what. Include online purchases, the $3 for the parking meter and the $30 you contributed to your friends\u2019 gift over Venmo.\n\nYou do not have to be perfect at this task. You just have to do it. Not forever. Just temporarily. If some spending slips through the cracks, do not worry.\n\nThis approach is free \u2014 no special tools needed. The view in black and white is a nearly effortless way to connect with your finances and improve your daily choices.\n\nConsciousness awareness of your spending is a powerful catalyst for change, healthier finances and greater peace of mind. Best of all, you will save money.\n\nCD Moriarty is a Vermont-based Certified Financial Planner who wants to create financial peace of mind for others.", "description": "This retro technique will change your finances.", "authors": ["Cd Moriarty"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GP554_head_i_ZG_20180905181355.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
