It was sort of a diatribe \u2026 Not focused on the facts, particularly the facts about how to contain Isis\u201d.\n\nMr Trump later posted multiple photos from the meeting while attacking the \u201cDo Nothing Democrats\u201d on Twitter. He shared a seemingly candid picture of Ms Pelosi with the caption, \u201cDo you think they like me?\u201d and then another that shows her standing up in the room as everyone else is seated, her finger pointed at the president who appears to be making a face back at her.\n\n\u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d he captioned the photo.\n\nThe House speaker then posted the image to her own Twitter profile. Hammill, her deputy chief of staff, posted a screenshot of her updated profile page and wrote, \u201cThanks for the new cover photo @realDonaldTrump!\u201d\n\nThanks for the new cover photo @realDonaldTrump! pic.twitter.com/bUatLr5S7D \u2014 Drew Hammill (@Drew_Hammill) October 16, 2019\n\nMs Pelosi also described the meeting as a meltdown in the press conference with Mr Schumer, as they informed the media they had walked out of the meeting with the president and Republican leaders.\n\n\u201cWhat we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown,\u201d she said. \u201cSad to say.\u201d\n\nJust before the meeting had taken place, the House passed a resolution condemning the president\u2019s actions in Syria in an emphatic 354-60 vote \u2014 a rare, major fracturing of the Republican House members and the White House.\n\nMs Pelosi said she believed \u201cthe size of the vote\u201d was part of the reason why Mr Trump appeared angry in the meeting at the White House.\n\n\u201cMore than two to one of the Republicans voted to oppose what the president did \u2014 it probably got to the president, because he was shaken up by it,\" she said.\n\nShe added: \u201cThat's why we couldn't continue in the meeting, because he was just not relating to the reality of it.\"", "description": "Nancy Pelosi changed her Twitter cover photo to a picture that shows her standing up to Donald Trump during a tense meeting at the White House after the president shared the image while mocking the House speaker.Ms Pelosi and other House leaders were at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the administration", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NmK1HI.ijcUaEvQWpu0LSw--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/1b1929c9f1e57ceac961c2ad97deecec", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
