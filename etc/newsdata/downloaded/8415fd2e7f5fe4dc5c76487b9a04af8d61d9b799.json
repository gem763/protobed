That\u2019s a trend proliferating within other publicly trading fossil-fuel companies.\n\nA new Exxon report on navigating a carbon-constrained world, combined with recent comments by top executives, make Exxon\u2019s approach clear. The company is doubling down on a decade-old strategy by making relatively small, long-term investments in two costly technologies: carbon capture and algae biofuels as a way to stay focused on its core hydrocarbon business. Here's how:\n\nIf technology can capture carbon from natural gas, the fuel will thrive longer under policies demanding sharp emission cuts.\n\nThe use of algae biofuels will further the use of internal combustion engines in cars over electric batteries.\n\nExxon held a first-ever dedicated session on climate change with analysts earlier this month during an annual meeting, a discussion that received little outside coverage. An Exxon spokesman, when reached for comment, referred to that session.\n\nA carbon tax of $100 a ton is needed to make carbon-capture technologies viable, Pete Trelenberg, Exxon\u2019s manager of environmental policy and planning, said at the analysts' meeting. The tax for biofuels to work would have to be even higher. Existing carbon prices around the world are much lower. \"By and large, we don\u2019t yet see adequate incentives to drive a lot of [carbon capture] into the marketplace,\u201d he said.\n\nto make carbon-capture technologies viable, Pete Trelenberg, Exxon\u2019s manager of environmental policy and planning, said at the analysts' meeting.

Company executives, including CEO Darren Woods , reiterated their years-long support for a carbon tax at this meeting, but that isn\u2019t translating into lobbying with the Republican-controlled Congress that opposes the idea.\n\n, reiterated their years-long support for a carbon tax at this meeting, but that isn\u2019t translating into lobbying with the Republican-controlled Congress that opposes the idea. Exxon's climate report to shareholders released in February assumes a massive expansion of the carbon-capture market in the coming decades along with increased demand for natural gas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re simultaneously negative on the existing technology but also betting on this breakthrough,\" said Andrew Logan, who directs the oil and gas program at Ceres, a group urging more sustainable investing. \"Not only that it will work, but that it\u2019ll be scalable at what looks like extremely ambitious levels.\"\n\nCritics say the purpose of these investor-pushed reports is to test companies\u2019 assets against a range of scenarios, not just ones with favorable assumptions. Logan also says Exxon\u2019s report doesn\u2019t assume much, if any, electrification of big trucks, which further bolsters the company\u2019s positioning in algae biofuels.\n\n\u201cWe all know, the conclusion in these reports is always going to be \u2018we\u2019re just fine,\u2019 \u201d Logan said. \u201cWhat\u2019s more important is understanding what those assumptions are and where they\u2019re reasonable and less reasonable.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, this is not a knock on the modeling at issue, or even on Exxon to a certain degree.\n\nMost modeling that keeps Earth\u2019s temperatures below the level scientists say is needed does envision widespread use of carbon-capture technologies because it has traditionally provided the most cost-effective pathway. I\u2019ve written about that a lot: here and here and here and here .\n\nand and and . Long-term modeling is also inherently uncertain work whose data often lags. Since 2012 when the data was collected, renewable-energy prices have plummeted, while carbon-capture tech hasn\u2019t. An updated version of the modeling is set to be released later this year.\n\nBottom line: Exxon's strategy is based on a range of scenarios with favorable assumptions for its core fossil-fuel business that let it address climate change without fundamentally changing its business model as a company that extracts fossil fuels. That makes it an outlier among giant oil companies that are making bigger bets outside the core hydrocarbon space.\n\n\u201cThey are off track compared to their competitors,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy consultant and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.", "description": "It's betting on existing natural gas and liquid fuels while other oil companies branch out to wind and solar.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/7depX0xK1hJuD2hKcr9BjjhqzlI=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2018/03/25/1521976642399.png", "published_at": "2018-03-25"}
