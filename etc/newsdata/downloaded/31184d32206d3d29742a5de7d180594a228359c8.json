Stock markets stunned by 'hanky panky' trading in Trump era", "language": "en", "text": "Unidentified traders have been making moves that netted hundreds of millions \u2013 sometimes within minutes \u2013 amid the chaotic moves of the Trump era in trade and other areas.\n\nOne such moe involved a 30-point gain in the S&P 500 index on Sept. 11th, the day President Donald Trump announced he would postpone some tariffs amid the ongoing trade war with China.\n\nThat same day, an investor or investors purchased contracts known as e-minis that jumped in value by $190 million based on Trump's comments and word from Beijing, an analysis by Vanity Fair found in an examination of several trades that earned immediate massive pay-days that were triggered by political events.\n\nUnidentified investors have made millions and in some cases more than $1 billion off trades that were impacted by market swings following political moves and statements by President Donald Trump\n\nDuring his trip to Osaka in June, President Trump declared U.S.-China talks 'back on track' and announced unspecified Chinese purchases of agriculture products.\n\nThe broad stock market then experienced a boomlet that was particularly beneficial to the personal or group who made a June 28 buy 420,000 e-minis, an electronically traded futures contract.\n\nThe purchases were put in 30 minutes before trading closed in Chicago markets. By about a week later, the person's investment had gained in value by $1.8 billion.\n\nReporter William Cohan, a former trader, reports that Chicago traders have been watching such transactions with 'shock and awe,' and that their timing \u2013 coupled with the huge earnings that accompanied them \u2013 has caused traders to wonder whether things are 'on the level.'\n\n'Are the people behind these trades incredibly lucky, or do they have access to information that other people don\u2019t have about, say, Trump\u2019s or Beijing\u2019s latest thinking on the trade war or any other of a number of ways that Trump is able to move the markets through his tweeting or slips of the tongue? Essentially, do they have inside information?' he wrote.\n\nInvestors earned a $180 million profit by buying futures contracts 10 minutes before the close of trading before the attack on Saudi oil infrastructure\n\nThe futures trades were made at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where regulators have the ability to monitor any suspicious market moves.\n\nAlthough the Vanity Fair piece does not level accusations at any particular insider, it points to the 'fantastically profitable mystery of the Trump chaos trades' in a sub-headline.\n\nTrump regularly talks up the stock market and has bragged during key milestones. At the same time, he doesn't shy from brash rhetoric, such as threatening in a letter to Turkey's president that he didn't want to be responsible for 'destroying the Turkish economy.'\n\nTrump infamously told reporters in August that 'we\u2019ve gotten two calls\u2014very, very good calls' from Chinese officials, during a time of high trade tensions. The White House late said Trump misspoke and conflated events to include public comments Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.\n\nIn one trade, investors made a $180 million profit by buying futures contracts 10 minutes before the close of trading before the attack on Saudi oil infrastructure.\n\nAnother trade the story examines is when someone bought 55,000 e-mini contracts Sept. 3. Soon after, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced she was pulling back the controversial extradition bill that had led to angry street protests. The purchaser made an $82.5 million profit, according to the article.", "description": "Traders have earned millions with late-in-the-day trades shortly before key market-moving events, including comments by President Trump about the China trade war.", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/20/19847280-0-image-a-30_1571341624485.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
