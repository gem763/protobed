(Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)\n\nKevin Feige turned B-list Marvel superheroes into Hollywood legends, so imagine what he can do with a lightsaber.\n\nFeige, the president of Marvel Studios, will develop a new Star Wars movie, according to the Hollywood Reporter. As the Skywalker family saga ends this December with the release of \u201cStar Wars: Episode IX \u2014 The Rise of Skywalker,\u201d Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy is looking to usher in the next phase in Disney\u2019s faraway universe.\n\n\u201cWith the close of the Skywalker Saga, Kathy is pursuing a new era in Star Wars storytelling, and knowing what a die-hard fan Kevin is, it made sense for these two extraordinary producers to work on a Star Wars film together,\u201d Alan Horn, the co-chairman of Walt Disney Studios, told THR.\n\nFeige\u2019s fandom has already proved helpful with that other franchise: With his encyclopedic knowledge of all things Marvel, Feige helped mold Marvel Studios films into the definitive cinematic experience, despite not having control over some of the company\u2019s most popular characters, Spider-Man and the X-Men (who were with Sony and Fox).\n\nWith the movie rights Marvel Studios was able to scoop up with secondary heroes Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye, Feige was able to form the Avengers. The heaviest of those hitters would go on to have solo movies, and the Avengers\u2019 on-screen team-ups turned into worldwide box-office events.\n\n[\u2018Black Panther II\u2019: Five things we want to see in the 2022 sequel]\n\nThough Marvel Studios and Sony would go on to split the Spider-Man rights for a time, meaning the popular character was added to the Avengers lineup, they have since split. While the two Hollywood powers\u2019 separation when it comes to the wall-crawler has been the one blemish on Feige\u2019s otherwise perfect report card, Feige and Marvel Studios deserve the credit for making Spidey great again after some floundering in movie purgatory. And with Disney purchasing Fox, the X-Men could soon be getting the Feige touch after the disastrous results of Fox\u2019s final X-Men film \u201cDark Phoenix.\u201d\n\nBut Feige working on anything Star Wars-related is next level.\n\nStar Wars\u2019 return to the big screen \u2014 after Disney purchased Lucasfilm from George Lucas for $4 billion \u2014 has been a moneymaker, but not without controversy.\n\n\u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d guided fans back into this universe with the nostalgia of the original cast, as Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and the late Carrie Fisher ushered in the next generation of Star Wars heroes and villains.\n\nNext-gen hero/villain combo Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) were a part of the next sequel, the divisive \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi,\u201d directed by Rian Johnson. But \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d director J.J. Abrams was brought back to try to assure the final film in the new trilogy ends with a satisfying big bang.\n\nThough the franchise\u2019s 2010s comeback has been spotty, as stand-alone films such as \u201cRogue One\u201d and \u201cSolo\u201d didn\u2019t make the type of waves expected for films so highly anticipated, Feige is seen as someone with the magic touch. He made Ant-Man into a household name, and turned the Guardians of the Galaxy \u2014 heroes even die-hard comic fans weren\u2019t that familiar with \u2014 into part of a major franchise (and would include both as part of the Avengers machine).\n\nHe could help do something similar with lesser-known or brand-new Star Wars characters, or he could go straight to the big time. Imagine a retelling of a legend such as Darth Vader that delves into his prime years, based on the fantastic tales Marvel Comics has published lately to which Feige has total access. (If Feige made a two-hour Vader movie as good as the final moments of \u201cRogue One,\u201d they should go ahead and start building statues dedicated to him at all Disney parks.)\n\nWe still haven\u2019t seen the greatest lightsaber battle ever \u2014 the one that was supposed to take advantage of modern 21st-century special effects and top the brilliant \u201cDuel of the Fates\u201d/Obi-Wan Kenobi/Qui-Gon Jinn vs. Darth Maul battle from the polarizing \u201cThe Phantom Menace.\u201d But we have to imagine Feige probably already has something cooked up to top it, because how can you doubt the guy who made the Infinity Gauntlet common knowledge in the pop culture stratosphere?\n\nDisney is also without a doubt thinking about its big debut in November of Disney+, a monster that will continually need to be fed with content. Original series \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d looks like a winner, but Feige plotting in the Star Wars universe would be an incredible addition to an already loaded streaming service.\n\nBecause Feige fixed Marvel on film. Feige fixed Spider-Man when the brand was dead on arrival. Star Wars doesn\u2019t need fixing, per se, but it does need Feige to give it a fresh shot in the arm.\n\nThe possibilities are too spectacular to ignore. May the Force be with him.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018The Rise of Skywalker\u2019 trailer: 6 takeaways from the Star Wars Episode IX celebration", "description": "The Marvel Studios mastermind is about to enter a galaxy that is far, far away.", "authors": ["David Betancourt", "Reporter Focusing On Comic Book Culture", "September At Pm", "David Betancourt Writes About All Aspects Of Comic Book Culture For The Washington Post'S Comic Riffs Blog."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GPJ9KfB5dvddoZubYHAJBWXfWj4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HEB3DJWV24I6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
