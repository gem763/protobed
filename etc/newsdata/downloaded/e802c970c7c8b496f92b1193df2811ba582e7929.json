Marco Rubio (R-FL) asked Sullivan,\n\nWere you aware at any time, until, of course, the stuff was broken in the press, but before that time, did anyone ever come to you, or were you ever aware of that sort of connection, that quid pro quo that\u2019s being alleged? Was that something that you were a part of?\n\n\u201cI was not Senator. \u2026 I was not aware \u2026 not until the recent developments and disclosures from the whistleblower\u2019s complaints,\u201d Sullivan declared.\n\nHouse impeachment investigators are trying to determine if President Trump leveraged Ukraine security assistance in exchange for a probe into corruption allegations against the Bidens during a July 25 call.\n\nA \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint accusing Trump of making a quid pro quo offer during the call in which the president threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine until the Eastern European country investigates the Bidens is at the center of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI was aware that there was a hold on security assistance to Ukraine, I wasn\u2019t aware of the reason,\u201d Sullivan told Senators.\n\nHe added, however, that he believed using aid as leverage to pressure a foreign investigation of a political rival \u201cwould be inconsistent with our values.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsking a foreign government to investigate a domestic political rival as opposed to a larger anti-corruption campaign which we have been engaged in, encouraging the Ukrainians for years, those are two different things,\u201d Sullivan explained.\n\nSullivan stressed that neither he nor U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had issued orders to condition the aid to Ukraine on any investigation.\n\nThe comments by Sullivan that he did not know there was an effort to push Ukraine to investigate the Bidens echoed the testimony given by some impeachment probe witnesses former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, and Acting Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Philip Reeker.\n\nSullivan\u2019s comments, however, directly contradicted impeachment inquiry testimony by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert at the National Security Council (NSC), and Acting Ukraine Amb. Bill Taylor.\n\nTaylor and Vindman claim a quid pro quo took place.", "description": "The State Dept. #2 said he \"was not aware\" of an effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/John-Sullivan-Senate-Committee-on-Foreign-Relations-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
