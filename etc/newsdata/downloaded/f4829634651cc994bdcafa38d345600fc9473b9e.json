Some professors were none too impressed with the event.\n\nKanye West, flanked by wife Kim Kardashian, kicked off the event at around 8 a.m., and attracting hundreds of students. The rapper performed his 2014 hit song \u201cJesus Walks\u201d and spoke about Christianity and the plight of African Americans.\n\nThough many of the students were pleasantly surprised by West\u2019s impromptu appearance, a handful of lecturers had choice words for him.\n\nGreg Carr, who serves as an associate professor at Howard\u2019s University\u2019s Afro-American Studies Department, suggested West should visit the school\u2019s library following his performance.\n\n\u201cI have some books for him,\u201d Carr wrote on Twitter with the hashtag #TheMiseducationOfTheNegro.\n\nKeneshia Grant, an assistant professor of Political Science, tweeted: \u201cThis Kayne [sic] church thing makes me uncomfortable. There, I said it.\u201d\n\nFrederick Joseph, author of The Black Friend, also bashed the rapper and attendees, writing: \u201cCan\u2019t blame Kanye anymore, he\u2019s shown us who he is. Black people need to stop making space for his anti-Blackness.\u201d\n\nThe professors\u2019 harsh words aren\u2019t the first directed at West and his Sunday Service.\n\nThe Metro Times reports: \u201cSome Black critics have called West\u2019s event \u201cblasphemous,\u201d pointing to the pricey \u201cChurch Merch\u201d line of sportswear for sale at previous stops which includes items like a $225 sweatshirt emblazoned with the words \u201cHoly Spirit\u201d and $50 socks that say \u201cJesus Walks.\u201d (After backlash, West removed his online \u201cChurch Merch\u201d store). Others have called \u201cSunday Service\u201d a \u201ccult.\u201d\u201d\n\nWest\u2019s popup singers and musicians have made various appearances on Sundays since January including a stop in Dayton, Ohio, at a benefit event supporting the community affected by the mass shooting.\n\nLast week, thousands of people showed up to an outdoor shopping center in Utah to see the rapper perform what he calls a worship service.\n\nThe concert was held right before the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints held its twice-yearly conference in Salt Lake City.\n\nAfterward, the Salt Lake Tribune reported that West prayed and testified to the crowd about his religious journey.\n\nHe also talked about politics and what he called the dangers of social media.
