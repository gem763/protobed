More than half of those crashes involve alcohol and/or drugs. Our School Assembly Program is aimed at students in Grades 7 \u2013 12, to illustrate the dangers of impaired driving and get them talking about how they can prevent and avoid it.\u201d\n\nMADD Canada is marking the program\u2019s national tour with a special screening at Hillcrest School in Edmonton today, in partnership with the program\u2019s National Sponsors, Allstate Insurance Company of Canada and Westcan Bulk Transport.\n\nOver the course of the school year, MADD Canada\u2019s team of School Outreach Representatives will deliver more than 2,000 presentations of Over the Edge to middle and high schools across the country. With the support of Allstate Canada, Westcan Bulk Transport and other generous sponsors, hundreds of thousands of students will see this sober driving message over the current school year.\n\n\u201cAllstate Canada is proud to be part of this effort to educate youth about the dangers of impaired driving and help them establish a foundation for life-long safe and sober driving habits,\u201d said Allstate Insurance Company of Canada President and CEO Ryan Michel. \u201cMADD Canada\u2019s School Assembly Program is an impactful way to begin that dialogue with youth people and encourage them to make safe and responsible choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommitted to industry excellence as a transportation leader, road safety remains a top priority and lies at the core of what we do across North America, every day,\u201d said Grant Mitchell, Chief Operating Officer of the Kenan Advantage Group, Westcan Bulk Transport\u2019s parent company. \u201cPartnering with MADD Canada to bring the safe and sober driving message to young people is a natural fit for us, and we are pleased to once again support this important program.\u201d\n\nOver The Edge shows the story of 17-year-old Sam, who moves back to her hometown to live with her Dad while her Mom travels for work. At a party to celebrate Sam\u2019s homecoming, she reunites with her two best friends, Kat and Adam, and meets Kat\u2019s friend, Steve. The group catches up while drinking and smoking cannabis. Things quickly get out of hand when Kat divulges a secret, and Sam and Adam leave. Knowing she shouldn\u2019t drive, Sam\n\n\n\ncalls her Dad to pick them up. The next morning, Sam and her Dad decide to go fishing. On the way, Sam gets a text from Kat saying that Steve is driving impaired. Sam and her Dad agree to pick Kat up at a nearby farm, and Sam calls the police to report Steve\u2019s impaired driving. Suddenly, a crash happens, changing all of their lives forever.\n\nAfter that fictional story concludes, viewers see interviews with real-life victims of impaired driving who talk about their loved ones who were killed or injured in crashes. This year\u2019s program tells the stories of:\n\n\n\nCassius Richards\n\nCassius was killed when an impaired driver, with over twice the legal limit of alcohol in his system, sped through a red light and hit his car. The impaired driver was convicted and sentenced to four years in prison. For Cassius\u2019 family, there is a void left in their hearts that can never be filled.\n\nDoug Stewart & Emily Stewart\n\nA day before Father\u2019s Day, Doug and his daughter Emily were on their way home when a cannabis-impaired driver collided with their car head-on after swerving into the middle of the road of a two-lane highway. Doug was killed in the crash. Emily suffered broken bones and a critical brain injury, and was not expected to live. With courage and perseverance, she survived and has made inspiring progress, but she will never fully recover from her injury.\n\nStanley Thomson\n\nOne evening, four carloads of teenagers stopped at a restaurant on their way home from a high school graduation party. After getting a bite to eat, the friends got back into their cars, with one of the drivers high on cannabis, and they headed home. The driver who was high began to play a daring game of leapfrog with his vehicle. Suddenly, one vehicle pulled out directly in front of an oncoming tractor trailer and triggered a devastating chain reaction of collisions. Five of the young men, including Stanley, died in the crash and eleven were seriously or permanently injured.\n\nSurveys show MADD Canada\u2019s education efforts are resonating with young people. In a 2017-2018 survey about that year\u2019s School Assembly Program, titled The Pact, students said: the program effectively delivered the sober driving message (66%); it motivated them to make the right decision when it comes to preventing impaired driving (74%); they had or planned to have conversations with family and friends about impaired driving (73%); and they supported having a similar presentation at the school the following year (97%).\n\nTo see a clip of the new program, visit the School Programs page on the MADD Canada web site at: https://madd.ca/pages/programs/youth-services/school-programs/ .\n\nCanadian students are seeing how one single decision can change their lives forever in MADD Canada\u2019s new 2019-2020 School Assembly Program, titled Over the Edge, which began its nation-wide tour of schools in September.\n\n\n\n\u201cYouth are at increased risk for impaired driving,\u201d said MADD Canada Chief Executive Officer Andrew Murie. \u201cRoad crashes are the number one cause of death among Canadian youth.
