Along the way, he was the executive producer of \u201cToday\u201d when Lauer was hired in 1994.\n\nNBC NEWS PRESIDENT MOCKED BY STAFFERS DURING FIERY MEETING ABOUT LAUER RAPE CLAIM\n\nBy 2001, Zucker was president of NBC Entertainment. In this role, he resumed oversight of Lauer -- then NBC\u2019s biggest star -- and was frequently in touch with him about important matters related to \u201cToday.\u201d\n\nA former NBC News employee with knowledge of Zucker\u2019s relationship with Lauer feels the two shared a unique bond.\n\n\u201cThey are very close friends. Jeff even did a Friars Club roast of Matt where he cracked jokes about Matt\u2019s marital problems,\u201d the former NBC News employee told Fox News. \u201cAt NBC, [Zucker] was the one person who could tell Matt to shut up.\u201d\n\nNBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK\u2019S LEADERSHIP SCRUTINIZED AS RONAN FARROW TELL-ALL APPROACHES\n\nAt the 2008 roast, Zucker made several lewd remarks about Lauer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just good to see Matt up here and not under my desk,\u201d Zucker said from the podium, according to a media executive who attended. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say Matt is a germophobe, but he\u2019s the only guy I know who uses Purell both before and after he masturbates.\u201d\n\nWhen Lauer was abruptly fired by NBC for sexual misconduct nine years later, in 2017, Zucker said at Business Insider\u2019s Ignition conference that the news was \u2018incredibly disturbing\u201d and \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d\n\nCNN, MSNBC IGNORE MATT LAUER RAPE ALLEGATIONS, NBC SCANDAL DURING PRIME TIME\n\n\"I've known Matt for 25 years and, I didn't know this Matt,\u201d Zucker claimed at the time. \u201cThere was never a complaint about Matt. \u2026 There was never a suggestion of that kind of deviant or predatory behavior. There was never even a whisper of it.\u201d\n\nAt the time, former CNN Chief White House Correspondent and USC Annenberg journalism professor Jessica Yellin said Zucker\u2019s comments missed the point.\n\n\u201cThis speaks to a problem with the culture and leadership of the workplace,\u201d Yellin wrote in a scathing Twitter thread. \u201cCreating a workplace in which women feel they can't report harassment isn't exonerating.\u201d\n\nZucker\u2019s comments at the conference mirrored the subsequent findings of a controversial internal review that NBC News launched to determine who knew about Lauer\u2019s alleged misconduct. Lack insisted on keeping the investigation in-house, despite calls for an outside firm to take over. NBC General Counsel Kim Harris eventually declared that her colleagues were completely oblivious to Lauer\u2019s supposed behavior.\n\nANDY LACK TAKES AIM AT FARROW'S CLAIMS HE WAS BLOCKED FROM REPORTING ON ALLEGED WEINSTEIN CRIMES\n\nNBC declared that the investigation \u201cfound no evidence indicating that any NBC News or \u2018Today\u2019 show leadership\u201d received any complaints about Lauer\u2019s misconduct prior to the November 2017 complaint that resulted in his ousting. But once Lauer was fired, complaints began to surface and a 2017 New York Times report about a Lauer incident that allegedly happened during Zucker\u2019s time at NBC was particularly shocking.\n\n\u201cOne complaint came from a former employee who said Mr. Lauer had summoned her to his office in 2001, locked the door and sexually assaulted her,\u201d The New York Times reported. \u201cShe told The Times that she passed out and had to be taken to a nurse.\u201d\n\n\u2018TODAY\u2019 ADDRESSES \u2018APPALLING\u2019 NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT\u2019S JUST VERY PAINFUL'\n\nThe CNN boss and Lauer are apparently still friends and the fallen morning show host reportedly attended Zucker\u2019s magic-themed birthday bash earlier this year alongside Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo.\n\nThe New York Post, which first reported that a \u201crelaxed-looking\u201d Lauer attended the party, followed up with a report that Zucker was forced to shoot down rumors that Lauer would revive his career at CNN.\n\n\u201cSome staff were starting to freak out that Matt Lauer was suddenly about to come back from the dead and show up at CNN\u2019s shiny new Manhattan office at Hudson Yards,\u201d a CNN insider told the Post in May.\n\nThe insider added that \u201csome senior female employees would refuse to work with him,\u201d but the women of CNN weren\u2019t put in that position after all. Zucker told concerned staffers that \u201cthere is absolutely no truth at all in the reports that Matt is coming to CNN,\u201d according to the Post.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nLauer reportedly isn\u2019t working for CNN anytime soon, but Zucker\u2019s network gave his old pal a pass on prime-time coverage of the disgraced anchor\u2019s latest scandal.\n\nRonan Farrow\u2019s upcoming \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d contains a disputed claim that Lauer raped an NBC colleague during the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Japan. While NBC found the bombshell claim important enough to cover on its own \u201cNightly News\u201d and \u201cToday,\u201d Zucker\u2019s CNN completely ignored the story during prime time.\n\n\u201cAnderson Cooper 360,\u201d \u201cCuomo Prime Time,\u201d \u201cCNN Tonight\u201d and \u201cWhite House in Crisis\u201d failed to mention Lauer on Wednesday, according to a review of transcripts by Fox News.\n\nCNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "NBC News executives are back in hot water as new questions arise about how the network handled sexual misconduct allegations against Matt Lauer -- but one puzzling fact is how Jeff Zucker,\u00a0Lauer\u2019s boss for many of his years in power and\u00a0current CNN president, has managed to avoid the criticism NBC leaders are facing.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
