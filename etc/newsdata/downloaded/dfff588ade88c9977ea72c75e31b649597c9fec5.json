City Press has now reliably learnt that Safa has recommended referees Victor Hlungwani and Thando Ndzandzeka to next year\u2019s panel of international match officials.\n\nThe association was left with egg on its face with no senior officials on the Fifa panel after dropping the duo and others earlier this year.\n\nThe move did not go down well in some quarters and it backfired spectacularly as it left Safa with only two active referees \u2013 Victor Gomes and Eugene Mdluli \u2013 on the international panel and two others, Daniel Bennett and Chris Harrison, who were recommended but were not utilised by CAF and Fifa.\n\nGomes has been appointed to officiate at the Fifa Under-17 World Cup in Brazil \u2013 which kicks off next week \u2013 while Mdluli is off to Ghana next weekend for the clash between Asante Kotoko and Football Club de San Pedro of Ivory Coast.\n\nThis week a high-ranking Safa official let slip that Hlungwani and Ndzandzeka were among those recommended back to the panel as the association aims to reclaim its status on the continent.\n\nSouth Africa used to be the leading supplier of match officials in Africa but has since fallen back.\n\nAnastasia Tsichlas, chairperson of the referees\u2019 committee, confirmed that they have finalised the list of match officials to Fifa.\n\nBut she could not divulge the names, as they had not been sent yet.\n\n\u201cWe have reports and scores from all our committees [technical, appointment, examination and review] and based on their feedback we have recommended names to Fifa for consideration,\u201d said Tsichlas yesterday.\n\nShe was quick to add that Safa wanted to reclaim its position on the continent.\n\n\u201cWe have recommended many names this time around because we want to have many officials on the list. South Africa is the go-to country when it comes to match officials and we want to maintain that leading role, particularly with women referees.\u201d\n\nA fortnight ago City Press reported that assistant referee Mervin van Wyk\u2019s name was also on the list sent to Fifa but has since been removed following his two glaring mistakes in the game between AmaZulu and Kaizer Chiefs. This was after he had denied AmaZulu two legitimate goals.", "description": "Safa has made a U-turn and recommended two local referees as international match officials for next year\u2019s Fifa panel after dropping them this year.", "authors": ["Timothy Molobi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9494/1bb4242cb0c64b45a90da2d0555958d1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
