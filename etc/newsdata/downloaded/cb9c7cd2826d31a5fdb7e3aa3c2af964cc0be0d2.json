Don't do it drinking spirits over there.\n\n'If it's free poured spirits behind the bar there is a chance that your parents may not get to see you (again)\n\n'If you're going to be in Bali, do it smart and do it safely. By all means have a good time, just don't drink spirits in Bali.'\n\nMr Ahern said there's still a number of drinks that revellers can safely drink on the Indonesian party island, such as Smirfnoff Ice, Blackjack, beer, cider and wine.\n\nMr Chalmers and friends assumed because they were in a reputable bar in Seminyak that the cocktails were safe to drink despite the risks of drinking spirits in Bali.\n\nSpirit bottles are often tainted with methanol on the island as it is found in locally-made spirits such as arak.\n\nBailey Chalmers (pictured right) is lucky to be alive after drinking a cocktail at a Balinese nightclub that contained spirits that were contaminated with methanol\n\nThis puts drinkers at risk of developing methanol poisoning when locals re-use spirit bottles and distribute them to bars and restaurants.\n\nMr Chalmers had two shots of a tainted spirit on a night out and blacked out, waking up the following morning on the ground outside his villa with a huge hangover.\n\n'I didn't drink another drink and I can't remember anything, and I have never been so drunk in my life,' he told 9News.\n\nThe next day, the 19-year-old assumed he was suffering a regular hangover and went to have breakfast with friends when aggressive symptoms kicked in.\n\nHe started to lose his vision and had difficulty breathing, with intense stomach pains and vomiting, and went to a local medical centre with a friend.\n\nMr Chalmers was sent to BIMC Hospital where doctors were more concerned with his travel insurance paying for his treatment, before telling him to come back the next day.\n\nDanielle Chalmers (pictured with her son Bailey) gave her son some unusual advice to help to cure his terrible hangover\n\nColin Ahern (pictured with Bailey Chalmers) gave Bailey's mother advice to drink vodka to stop the poison, ultimately saving his life\n\nHe told his mother Danielle about his hangover, who was horrified after hearing his symptoms that her son may have been poisoned.\n\n'I knew it was methanol poisoning,' Danielle said. 'All the red flags were there.'\n\nMr Chalmers flew home the next day for treatment in Perth's Sir Charles Gardiner hospital, where doctors worked to clear the chemical from his body.\n\n'The doctor said, 'you're really lucky to be alive, mate,' he said.\n\nMr Chalmers took to Facebook to warn his friends of the risks of drinking cocktails overseas.\n\nHe attached a video of a man making a counterfeit bottle of Johnny Walker whisky from a large drum.\n\n'All it takes is 1ml per 1KG of body weight to cause permanent blindness or even death... so for me that was just 2 shots,' Mr Chalmers posted.\n\n'So please stay safe and most importantly, just don't drink spirits in Bali.'", "description": "Perth man Bailey Chalmers is lucky to be alive after drinking cocktails at a Balinese nightclub that contained spirits that were contaminated with methanol.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni", "Jackson Barron For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/14/20038134-0-image-a-45_1571752671041.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
