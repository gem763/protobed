With Compassion, Charles Conwell\n\nBoxing obviously has a history of similar moments.\n\nAt least three boxers have died from injuries suffered in the ring in 2019, including a Bulgarian fighter who was competing under his cousin's license and using his medical records.\n\nLight heavyweight champion Adonis Stevenson was placed in a medically induced coma following his 2018 match against Ukraine's Oleksandr Gvozdyk. He has since regained consciousness and is continuing to recover, according to multiple reports.\n\nAfter the fight, Conwell asked his social media followers to pray for Day's recovery. 'Keep him in your prayers!! #prayforpatrickday,' he wrote on his Twitter page.\n\n'Pat Day makes any room he is in a better place. Never saw him greet someone without a big smile,' DiBella wrote on Twitter. 'Life doesn't seem fair sometimes. Please keep Pat in your prayers, thoughts and hearts.'\n\nPatrick Day (left) pictured with trainer Joe Harris in July of 2017 after a win on Long Island\n\nDay was unconscious when he was taken from the ring in a stretcher and loaded onto a waiting ambulance. He suffered a seizure in the ambulance and needed a breathing tube once he arrived at the hospital.\n\nConwell, a 2016 American Olympian, was dominating the fight dropping Day in the fourth and eighth rounds and then landing a right hand in the 10th which caused Day to stumble.\n\nSeconds later he rocked Day with a massive left hook that resulted in Day falling backwards and his head bouncing off the canvas. Referee Celestino Ruiz called off the fight at one minute, 46 seconds of the round.\n\nDay lay on the canvas for several minutes while receiving medical treatment before being removed from the ring.\n\nHe was coming off a loss in June to Carlos Adames in New York. He has 17 wins and four losses and one draw in his pro career which began in 2013.\n\nDay was fighting on the undercard of Russian Dmitry Bivol's successful WBA light-heavyweight world title defence and cruiserweight champion Oleksandr Usyk's heavyweight debut.", "description": "While boxer Patrick Day remains in a coma following a brutal knockout  in Chicago, his opponent, Charles Conwell, has written an emotional letter expressing regret and his own emotional turmoil.", "authors": ["Alex Raskin Sports News Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/15/19791322-0-image-a-21_1571235094708.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
