Sportsmail's Tom Farmery takes a look.\n\nReal Madrid narrowly beat Galatasaray but Zinedine Zidane still has plenty of work to do\n\nZidane gets his win but all is not well at Real\n\nThe suggestions were that should Real Madrid lose away at Galatasaray then Zinedine Zidane would be on his way. Even with a manager who has done so well at Real - as Zidane has, having won the Champions League three years in a row - the fans don't need long to turn.\n\nAgainst Galatasaray, Real were sluggish, played at a low tempo, had less of the ball than the hosts, yet eventually did enough to win 1-0. The only goal of the game came in the 18th minute when Eden Hazard supplied Toni Kroos. But this was far from the fluid Real side that dominated Europe only very recently. The fizz, the vigour, the swagger isn't there.\n\nHazard was supposed to help reinvigorate the side and excite a fanbase needing something to cheer. The truth is that Hazard does not at this stage look capable of making the sort of impact he so often would at Chelsea. Time is needed but much needs to change, including Hazard's performances.\n\nEden Hazard is yet to really find top gear for Real Madrid after joining in the summer\n\nThere must be some positives for Zidane, no?\n\nYes, there are. Just not that many. The main positive by quite a distance is the central defensive partnership that Raphael Varane and Sergio Ramos still share.\n\nThey were mightily impressive against Club Brugge - despite the visitors scoring twice - and in Turkey they made sure nothing got past them. It means the pair now boast a record of 27 wins, nine draws and just one defeat in the Champions League when playing together.\n\nThey have won the tournament four times and it is through their experience that Real remain contenders to reach the latter stages of the competition.\n\nThankfully, Sergio Ramos does continue to perform at the highest level for his side\n\nLevy right not to let Ndombele leaving Spurs training ground in the summer\n\nThe story goes that Daniel Levy, the Tottenham owner, told Tanguy Ndombele that he couldn't leave the training ground at Enfield until he had signed a contract.\n\nThe fact that happened is yet another reason why Tottenham's blip, if you want to call it that, could soon be over. His performance against Red Star on Tuesday night showcased his talents and demonstrated why Mauricio Pochettino may well have to ditch his 3-4-2-1 system for good.\n\nPochettino opted for his more tried-and-tested 4-2-3-1 with Heung-Min Son, Dele Alli and Erik Lamela behind Harry Kane. But it was alongside Moussa Sissoko, in a central midfield two, where Ndombele did most of his work. Working hard with Sissoko to cover ground while releasing Tottenham's wide attackers and connecting those centrally ahead of him.\n\nThe midfielder also supplied two assists: one for Son after Ndombele dispossessed Marko Marin and another for Kane who rounded things off at 5-0. It was a display that mixed attacking flair and defensive grit - more of the same is needed.\n\nTanguy Ndombele has proved to be a superb bit of business for Tottenham and Daniel Levy\n\nAlli lean and making an impact again\n\nWhat a refreshing sight it was to see Dele Alli striding forward up the pitch at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Stretching his legs to get in position to support Harry Kane.\n\nAlli has had to go through a period of reflection recently after being dropped from the England squad and failing to perform for Tottenham.\n\nBut against Red Star he appeared leaner than he has previously and he seemed to have more stamina than before. It is known that he has done more fitness work and that is what Alli's game is built on: high energy and endurance.\n\nSimilar to Ndombele, Alli is capable of producing performances of the highest quality. He just needs to show more of what he did on Tuesday night.\n\nDele Alli was energetic and full of desire in Tottenham's dominant victory over Red Star\n\nLewandowski breaks new ground\n\nTo understand just how crucial Robert Lewandowski is to Bayern Munich you don't need to look much further than his record this season.\n\nHis two goals in Bayern's win over Olympiacos helped them record a 3-2 win. Bayern had struggled but Lewandowski's contribution was crucial. Those two goals also took him to 18 goals for this season from 13 games.\n\nMore significantly, however, it moved him to 58 goals in 83 appearances in the Champions League, making him the fifth-highest scorer of all-time in the competition.\n\nBayern Munich's Robert Lewandowki is the fifth-highest scorer in Champions League history\n\nRonaldo's played them all... just about\n\nCristiano Ronaldo is a seasoned professional when it comes to competing at Europe's highest level.\n\nThe is his 16th season in the Champions League and there perhaps isn't a statistic more telling than the number of different teams he has faced.\n\nLokomotiv Moscow, who Juventus had to come back from behind to beat on Tuesday night, are the 50th side Ronaldo has now come up against.\n\nOnly Iker Casillas (53) and Ryan Giggs (51) have played more.\n\nLokomotiv Moscow were the 50th different side Cristiano Ronaldo has played in Europe\n\nDybala still crucial to Juventus\n\nIf anyone thought Juventus' attempts to get rid of Paulo Dybala would bother the Argentina international all that much then they were wrong.\n\nDybala may have had to make more appearances from the bench this season, but when called upon, as he was against Lokomotiv Moscow, he delivers.\n\nJuventus were 1-0 down and on the verge of an embarrassing defeat when Dybala, who made a rare start ahead of Gonzalo Higuain, scored in the 77th and 79th minute to get his side out of trouble.\n\nHe has shown he is dependable before and maybe Maurizio Sarri will show more faith after such an impressive display.\n\nPaulo Dybala showed he can still be relied on after scoring twice against Lokomotiv Moscow\n\nFoden needs time to mature... but at least he's on the pitch\n\nIt has become a debate among Manchester City fans and it focuses on Phil Foden. They want to see him play more but appreciate the wealth of talent City have make it difficult.\n\nSo when he got the nod to start against Atalanta it was all fairly exciting. The League Cup and FA Cup but now a chance to go from the off in the Champions League.\n\nIt brought an assist for Raheem Sterling for City's third of five goals and he showed a constant willingness to help his side attack. Perhaps it was too much desire and too much hunger to impress that led him to getting sent off for two yellow cards. Not that Pep Guardiola was overly concerned with the 19-year-old's dismissal.\n\n'He will learn,' Guardiola said. He will.\n\nPhil Foden may have seen red on Tuesday night but he showed plenty of positives besides that\n\nDinamo Zagreb and Atalanta won't beat you... but they will kick you\n\nWe all know how lower league teams tend to approach cup ties against higher-level opposition. They look to disrupt play by committing fouls before the opposition can break forward or put a reducer on them to remind them of a different challenge.\n\nIt is not dissimilar to how Dinamo Zagreb and Atalanta have approached this season's Champions League.\n\nIn just three games played, both sides have managed to commit 52 fouls.", "description": "Another enthralling night of Champions League action.
