PETA representatives brought up the issue at the company\u2019s most recent shareholder meeting, prompting Tesla CEO Elon Musk to promise to comply. But making a leather-free steering wheel seemed to be a sticking point \u2014 until now.\n\n\u201cI believe we were close to having a non-heated steering wheel, that\u2019s not leather,\u201d Musk said at the shareholder meeting, according to TechCrunch (which reported this first). \u201cThere are some challenges when [you] heat the non-leather material and also how well it wears over time.\u201d\n\nPETA has been working with Tesla for years on producing a synthetic leather. It also has led campaigns to urge global automakers like General Motors, Volkswagen, and Toyota to ditch animal products in their cars as well. \u201cBy ditching leather, including in its car seats, Tesla is sparing countless cows the cruelty inherent in the leather industry and staying true to its focus on sustainability,\u201d PETA said last June.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Tesla\u2019s first \u201cfully vegan\u201d car. The company has always offered cloth interiors for customers who don\u2019t want to use leather, and PETA has clarified that it\u2019s specifically interested in the more premium option of fake leather.", "description": "Animal activists rejoice: the interior of the Tesla Model 3 is now 100 percent leather-free.
