Do you have any idea what that means historically? It means I redefine everything in culture.\n\n\u2018Pagan Feast of Winter Solstice? Oh, that\u2019s now Jesus\u2019 Birthday. Pagan Feast of Spring? Oh, that\u2019s now EASTER WEEKEND. Pagan Celtic Festival involving dressing up and warding off evil spirits? Oh now it\u2019s All Saints Day and we celebrate the VICTORIOUS CHURCH THAT HAS OVERCOME BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB!!! CANDY PLEASE\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking about her decision to celebrate Halloween, Hailey continued: \u2018I\u2019m not afraid of the world. I\u2019m not afraid of any devil or demon incantation. They are terrified of me.\n\n\u2018Halloween is now MY HOLIDAY and I am claiming all candy for the glory of God and the celebration of the Saints. What now? I\u2019ll dress up however I like!\n\n\u2018My favorite characters, pop culture stuff, whatever. It\u2019s my party and you\u2019re invited.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m alive today and a Saint tomorrow. Give me candy.\u2019\n\nWe\u2019re not too sure, but it sounds like she wants some candy\u2026\n\nJustin and Hailey had a second wedding ceremony in South Carolina earlier this month.
