REUTERS/John Gress\n\nEach side blamed the other for the impasse in the United States\u2019 third-largest school district, where the strike began on Oct. 17, and the union, which represents the city\u2019s 25,000 teachers, has been without a contract since July 1.\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot and the Chicago Public Schools\u2019 chief executive, Janice Jackson, blasted the Chicago Teachers Union in a joint news conference on Sunday for not accepting the school system\u2019s offer.\n\n\u201cWe are enormously disappointed that CTU cannot simply take yes for an answer,\u201d Lightfoot said before listing the specifics on offer, including \u201ca big, 16 percent raise for teachers.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cAt every turn we\u2019ve met CTU\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nBut the union blasted the mayor\u2019s assertions that the schools had met much of its demands, declaring that Lightfoot used \u201cbad mayoral math\u201d to describe the schools\u2019 offer.\n\n\u201cSticking points at the table remain,\u201d including \u201ccontract language designed to rein in classroom overcrowding,\u201d union officials said in a late night statement.\n\n\u201cPut bluntly, the deal that CPS is touting will not set an enforceable class size standard for all schools.\u201d\n\nThe union also wants more support staff, a contract that runs three years instead of five, and more paid prep-time for elementary school teachers.\n\nThe weekend saw some progress however, as the union representing some school support staff made a tentative deal to end the strike, Lightfoot announced, covering custodians, security officers and bus aides.\n\nBut media, including the Chicago Times, said late on Sunday that 7,500 members of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) would not cross the CTU picket lines. The terms of the SEIU agreement were not immediately available.\n\nOn Friday, officials had been more optimistic for children to be back in school after the weekend, with the leader of the Chicago Teachers Union saying he was hopeful the previous day\u2019s talks had given the path towards a settlement.\n\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m guardedly optimistic,\u201d President Jesse Sharkey told a news conference.\n\nStriking teachers rallied again later on Friday at Chicago\u2019s Buckingham Fountain, however.\n\nThe strike is the latest in a wave of teacher work stoppages across the United States, some of which, such as a six-day work stoppage last winter in Los Angeles, have involved similar demands for more school resources.\n\nIt has lasted longer than walkouts elsewhere, except for a three-week strike by teachers in Union City, California in June.\n\nPresident Donald Trump plans to be in Chicago on Monday for a speech and fundraiser for a grouping of international police chiefs that is expected to draw thousands of protesters as well as supporters, Politico and other media said.\n\nBut it was unclear how the planned protests and picket lines of the striking teachers would affect traffic and police resources.\n\nLightfoot, a political newcomer elected in April, faced her first major test after Chicago teachers voted to strike following the failure of contract talks to strike a deal on pay, class overcrowding and a lack of support staff.\n\nShe has said the district could not afford the union\u2019s full demands, estimating they would cost an extra $2.4 billion each year for an increase of more than 30% in the current $7.7-billion school budget.", "description": "About 300,000 students in Chicago will miss classes for an eighth day on Monday, as the teachers' union and public school district failed over the weekend to resolve a deadlock in contract talks over class sizes, support staff levels and pay.", "authors": ["Rich Mckay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445773434&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0HM", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
