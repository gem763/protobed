ENAP has denied any connection between the delivery of the Iranian crude and the toxic fallout.\n\nActivists have ramped up pressure on the government to find the culprit and resolve issues at Quintero and at other so-called \u201csacrifice zones\u201d ahead of the COP25 United Nations climate change summit in December, when tens of thousands of environmentalists are expected to visit the Andean nation.\n\nENAP is the main oil refiner in Chile, which imports nearly all the fuel it consumes.", "description": "Chilean prosecutors will press charges against six executives of state energy company ENAP in relation to noxious fumes that caused hundreds to seek hospital treatment in 2018, the prosecutors' office confirmed to Reuters on Saturday.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
