And they were like, \u2018Run along. This is not your business. This is not going to go on your little TV show.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI said to myself \u2018I'm going to own this job. I'm going to make sure that I know this better than all of these guys and they're not gonna be able to push me around.\u2019\u201d - Maria Bartiromo, FOX Business\n\nHer comments come on the heels of the release of a \u2018Women in the Workplace\u2019 study that gauges how women continue to be underrepresented in corporate America and compares the progress that\u2019s been made.\n\nThe 2019 study, conducted by McKinsey & Co. and Leanin.org, reflected how businesswomen like Bartiromo are pushing back.\n\n\u201cIn the last five years, we\u2019ve seen more women rise to the top levels of companies,\u201d the study said. \u201cAn increasing number of companies are seeing the value of having more women in leadership, and they\u2019re proving that they can make progress on gender diversity.\u201d\n\nSince 2015, companies with three or more women in the C-suite have risen from 29 percent to 44 percent.\n\n\u201cStill, women continue to be underrepresented at every level,\u201d the study said. \u201cCompanies need to focus on where the real problem is \u2026 In reality, the biggest obstacle that women face is much earlier in the pipeline, at the first step up to manager. Fixing this \u201cbroken rung\u201d is the key to achieving parity.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nLeanin.org founder and CEO Rachel Thomas and McKinsey and Co. chief diversity and inclusion officer Lareina Yee joined FOX Business\u2019 \u201cMornings with Maria\u201d to further discuss their findings.\n\n\u201cWomen disproportionately lose out,\u201d Yee said. \u201cFor every 100 men promoted [to manager] that very first time, only 79 or 72 women are promoted. And if you're a black woman, that number is even less. And because we're losing so many women at that very first promotion, we're starting to see very few at the top.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cbroken rung\u201d analogy rings true in numbers. On average, men end up holding 62 percent of management positions, leaving women holding 38 percent.\n\n\u201cDiverse management teams lead to better profitability and higher performance.\u201d - Lareina Yee, McKinsey and Co. chief diversity and inclusion officer\n\nYee and Thomas provided solutions for companies to fix the \u201cbroken rung,\u201d including setting goals to hire more women in upper management, launching unconscious bias training and having clear evaluation criteria.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201c[Companies] need to create an opportunity-rich and fair workplace,\u201d Yee said. \u201cIf employees have this experience, then they're three times more likely to want to stay, three times more likely to want to be promoted and three times happier.\u201d", "description": "Women are rising in the workplace but are struggling to fix the \"broken rung\" of promotion to manager.", "authors": ["Angelica Stabile"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Maria-Bartiromo-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
