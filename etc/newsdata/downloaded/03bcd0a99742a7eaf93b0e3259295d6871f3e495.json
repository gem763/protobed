At the end of the day, it\u2019s bigger than Jamie Carragher, it\u2019s the club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Liverpool let themselves down that day, wearing t-shirts in support of someone who\u2019s been accused of a racist comment.\n\n\u2018Yet, eight years on and still the apology hasn\u2019t come from Liverpool in that sense.\u2019\n\nLuis Suarez was banned for racially abusing Patrice Evra (Picture: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCarragher apologised directly to Evra as they appeared in the Sky Sports studio on Monday night, saying: \u2018Apologies. There is no doubt we made a massive mistake; that was obvious.\n\n\u2018We got to the ground, had our lunch and then had a team meeting \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it was the manager [Kenny Dalglish] or [coach] Steve Clarke \u2013 asking one of the players if he was still wearing the shirt, and that is the first I had heard of it.\n\n\u2018I am not lying and saying I wasn\u2019t part of it because as the club we got it wrong, and I was vice-captain.\n\n\u2018I am not sure who was actually behind it. I don\u2019t think it had anything to do with the manager Kenny.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s support of Suarez caused a lot of controversy (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I think it was the players who were close to Luis in the dressing room, who really wanted to support their mate.\n\n\u2018Maybe I have to look at myself now and say I did not have the courage as an individual to say \u201cI am not wearing it\u201d.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think everyone within Liverpool Football Club thought what we were doing was right but I do think as a football club, or you as a family, your first reaction is to support them even if you know that they are wrong, and that is wrong.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvra explained his incredulous reaction to the t-shirts at the time: \u2018This is ridiculous. It\u2019s unbelievable. Even for the club, you put your own club into danger when you do those sorts of things.\n\n\u2018This was after the ban so which message do you send to the world when you do that?\u2019\n\nMORE: James Milner unsure over his contract situation at Liverpool: \u2018Who knows?\u2019\n\nMORE: Jurgen Klopp reacts after seven Liverpool stars receive Ballon d\u2019Or nominations", "description": "Rio Ferdinand has praised Jamie Carragher for his apology to Patrice Evra, but believes Liverpool remain in the wrong for their response to Luis Suarez's racism ban.
