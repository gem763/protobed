Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenZuckerberg launches public defense of Facebook as attacks mount Warren, Yang fight over automation divides experts Warren says making Israel aid conditional on settlement building is 'on the table' MORE (D-Mass.).\n\nThink about all the excessive and often disingenuous ideas that Warren has thrown out.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLike Evita standing on the balcony of the Casa Rosada, she just keeps flinging them forth to her admiring chanters below.\n\nTo begin with, everything is free or close to free for the devotees of her new social and political order \u2014 just as any good Peronist would propose.\n\nThere will be free higher education at all public colleges.\n\nThere will be no need to repay student loans in many cases.\n\nThere will be essentially free healthcare and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe agenda goes on and on.\n\nOf course, none of these things that purportedly bears no cost is actually free.\n\nSomeone, presumably, is going to pay the college faculty and the folks who mow the lawns at those colleges. In fact, unless Warren intends to make the faculty work harder \u2014 which, considering her background, is probably not in her gameplan \u2014 the cost of running a college or university will continue to consistently outstrip most other enterprises.\n\nStudent loans, once-borrowed, become someone\u2019s responsibility.\n\nIf they are not going to be paid back by the borrower, who gets the bill?\n\nThe payment will be made, most likely, by someone who is not going to be able to go to college \u2014 such as the person mowing the lawn, or someone in a coming generation.\n\nMedicare for All, the healthcare plan endorsed by Warren, is a grandly deceptive piece of political snake-oil salesmanship that promises, as all good socialist programs do, something for everyone at someone else\u2019s expense.\n\nThe only problem is that Medicare for All is a massive fraud.\n\nMedicare only reimburses hospitals and doctors under the present system at about 65 percent of the cost of the care they deliver. The rest of the cost, 35 percent, is passed on to those 180 million folks who have health insurance provided by their employers.\n\nBut under Medicare for All, Warren and her acolytes intend to abolish employer-provided, private insurance.\n\nThis means that the cost of Medicare for All, which is estimated to be between $30 trillion and $35 trillion over 10 years, will have to be picked up in massive taxes or additional federal debt paid for by our children or rationing (which is how single-payer systems in the United Kingdom and Canada are run). The quality of healthcare will drop dramatically and the cost will go up dramatically.\n\nThe Green New Deal, another initiative proselytized by Warren and her fans, is estimated to cost anywhere between $50 trillion and $93 trillion, according to an analysis by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nEven in Peronist terms, that is a great deal of money.\n\nThe United States federal debt today is $22 trillion, an all-time high. The Green New Deal would double, triple or even quadruple it.\n\nOf course, Warren and her exuberant audiences claim that all these programs and the many, many more she has thrown forth will be paid for by taxing the super-rich and re-educating corporate America.\n\nHer fervent followers shout \"two cents\" as she holds up two fingers.\n\nThis is what she claims the cost to the super-rich will be with her new tax on wealth \u2014 a tax she proclaims will pay for all her \"plans.\"\n\nWarren\u2019s pay-for is a flim-flam.\n\nEven assuming that the super-rich were so stupid as to fail to figure out a way to avoid most of her tax increases, those increases would raise less the $10 trillion. This would be far, far less than the bill for her proposals.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn other words, the share of her programmatic costs that would be paid for by her proposed tax on the super-rich is marginal at best.\n\nBut her large crowds continue to chant in unison: \"Two cents.\"\n\nWarren\u2019s followers seem to have the same genetic make-up as those of President Trump Donald John TrumpZuckerberg launches public defense of Facebook as attacks mount Trump leaning toward keeping a couple hundred troops in eastern Syria: report Warren says making Israel aid conditional on settlement building is 'on the table' MORE. They may use different phrases but the mob mindlessness clearly overlaps both sets of supporters.\n\nThese are folks who in the 1960s would have been called \"groupies.\"\n\n\"Lock Her Up,\" \"Send Her Back\" and \"Two Cents\" are just different sides of the same inane and mean-spirited coin.\n\nThey make no sense even when screamed in unison.\n\nLike the president, Warren now seems to have great traction, at least amongst her fanatical following.\n\nHer \"plans,\" if they are looked at outside the prism of the European socialist movement, should be seen as a recipe for dumbing down our entrepreneurial culture and radically reducing our standard of living.\n\nThey should be \"dead on arrival.\"\n\nBut, like Frankenstein\u2019s monster, amazingly, \"it lives.\"\n\nJudd Gregg (R) is a former governor and three-term senator from New Hampshire who served as chairman and ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, and as ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Foreign Operations subcommittee.", "description": "OPINION: The Massachusetts senator is recycling old socialist ideas \u2014 and getting surprising traction.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/warrenelizabeth_100219getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
