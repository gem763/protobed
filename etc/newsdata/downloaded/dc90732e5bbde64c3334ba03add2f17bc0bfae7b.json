The nonbinding vote amounts to an endorsement for approval.\n\nThe FDA is expected to make its final decision by January.\n\nThe panelists said the medication was an important option for parents and children dealing with peanut allergies. However, several also said they had concerns because the pill has to be taken continuously to maintain its effect.\n\nAn estimated 1.6 million children and teenagers in the U.S. would be eligible for the medication, to be sold as Palforzia, which is intended for ages 4 to 17.\n\nPeanut allergy is the most common food allergy in the country and the standard treatment involves strictly monitoring what children eat. That approach doesn\u2019t always work and accidental exposure is common, sending 1 in 4 children with peanut allergies to the emergency room every year.\n\nParents at Friday\u2019s meeting urged approval of the drug, describing the anxiety of watching their children\u2019s diet and daily routine, even avoiding public places and transportation because of possible peanut residues.\n\n\u201cThese are constant and real fears with extreme consequences,\u201d said Cathy Heald of Dallas, whose 12-year-old son Charlie took part in a study of the treatment.\n\nHeald said her son\u2019s improved tolerance allowed him to travel overseas by himself for the first time.\n\n\u201cThe peace of mind this treatment brings is invaluable\u201d said Hill, whose trip to the meeting was paid by Aimmune.\n\nAfter one year, about 66% of study participants who took the pills could tolerate the equivalent of three to four peanuts, compared to just 4% of patients who received a dummy treatment. At the beginning of the study, most participants could not tolerate even a minuscule amount of peanuts.\n\nBut the benefits of the treatment came with risks. More than 9% of patients taking the pills reported severe allergic reactions, more than twice the number in the placebo group. And 11% of patients dropped out of the company\u2019s study due to side effects.\n\n\u201cThe effectiveness of the treatment has, in fact, not been demonstrated,\u201d said Dr. John Kelso, of Scripps Clinic in San Diego, who voted against the treatment.\n\nThe California-based company has previously said it expects the first six months of treatment to cost $5,000 to $10,000 and $300 to $400 a month after that. The company declined to elaborate on price earlier this week.\n\nAimmune is pursuing other treatments for common food allergies, including eggs. The company does not yet have any products on the market.\n\n___\n\nFollow Matthew Perrone on Twitter: @AP_FDAwriter\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
