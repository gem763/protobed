Itani believes the numbers killed have risen since then.\n\nLebanon lies on one of the world\u2019s most important migration routes and for many species \u2014 such as storks, lesser spotted eagles and pelicans \u2014 the most dangerous part of their journey is flying over the small Mediterranean country.\n\n\u201cHundreds of thousands of white storks are killed in Lebanon every year,\u201d Itani said.\n\nBird protection groups have successfully raised awareness in some regions but the situation in the north remains \u201cout of control\u201d, according to a joint statement by the Association for Bird Conservation in Lebanon and the Committee Against Bird Slaughter, based in Germany.\n\nThe statement was released after a field visit organised for Lebanese and foreign officials Tuesday.\n\nItani said poachers in the north \u201care shooting for fun, big numbers. They shoot even at night, using spotlights\u2026 They have WhatsApp groups to track the birds together.\u201d\n\nCountries such as Poland and others along migratory routes have pressured Lebanon to take action.\n\nKilling of birds has been reduced in some areas this year through the awareness campaigns and in cooperation with authorities, the statement said, but improved bird protection laws have yet to be enforced by the security forces.\n\nThe joint statement called for the creation of a professional and dedicated wildlife crime unit to curb poaching during migration periods.", "description": "Aghbeh (Lebanon) (AFP) \u2013 Bird protection groups called Tuesday for urgent action to save endangered migratory species that are being decimated by", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/3e451a_dead-lesser-spotted-eagle-is-displayed-by-activists-an-observation-camp-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
