That refusal came just hours before Sondland, a Trump mega donor, was to appear.\n\nYovanovitch, who was recalled from her post in May after coming under attack from Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other conservatives with unsubstantiated allegations that she tried to hold up anti-corruption efforts in the Ukraine, is still a member of the foreign service.\n\nDemocrats have sought to question Yovanovitch, who was abruptly recalled last spring, for her insight into the Trump administration\u2019s relationship with Ukraine.\n\nPHOTO: Former Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker departs following a closed-door deposition led by the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill, Oct. 3, 2019, in Washington, DC.

She is expected to face questions about her knowledge, if any, of the Ukraine episode.\n\nHill recently left her White House post at the National Security Council, and her testimony on Capitol Hill would come after an appearance by Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine.\n\nPHOTO: President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy looks on during a meeting in New York on September 25, 2019, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.
