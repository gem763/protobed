He's described not as a rapist and mass murderer, but as an austere religious scholar.\n\nThey later changed it, not because they realized it was obscene, but because they got caught.\n\nThat's our media. Even in big moments, they look small.\n\nBaghdadi took his kids with him when he blew himself up. I guess that makes him a family man, too.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFrom now on, whenever the Post judges President Trump's words, let's remind them that they called a deviant fiend an \"austere religious scholar.\"\n\nThe upside: it led to a fun Twitter contest for other Post obituaries.\n\n\"Adolf Hitler, passionate community planner and dynamic public speaker, dies at 56.\"\n\n\"Acclaimed mass transit administrator Benito Mussolini, dead at 61.\"\n\n\"Jeffrey Dahmer, lover of exotic cuisine, dies at 34.\"\n\nThe ISIS spokesman also got killed. Or, as the Post would say, \"Another outspoken activist silenced by Trump.\"\n\nSo, as people cheered, the media smeared.\n\nThey can't cut the guy one break.\n\nAnd at the World Series, the D.C. crowd heckled Trump.\n\nWhat a contrast. As America cheers a victory over terror, swamp fans boo the guy bringing the news.\n\nBut it's a risk an outsider takes when he shows up in a place full of journalists and bureaucrats.\n\nIf you play the same tune 24/7, life has a way of mocking the song.\n\nBut it's all good. It's even all great.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTerrorism will never die, but at least be glad that one terrorist did.\n\nAnd our hero dog will recover, even if the media won't.\n\nAdapted from Greg Gutfeld\u2019s monologue on \u201cThe Five\u201d on October 28, 2019.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY GREG GUTFELD", "description": "Our hero dog will recover, even if the media won't.", "authors": ["Greg Gutfeld", "Greg Gutfeld Currently Serves As Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/28/694940094001_6098581653001_6098575585001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
