The good news is, some things are about to change around here.\n\nWhen my kid gets sick, he blows his nose. A lot. And this is what the end table next to our couch usually looks like:\n\nIf this were not staged, there would be a bunch of Legos mixed in, too. (Photo: Meghan Moravcik Walbert)\n\nThen I\u2019ve got to decide: Do I waste yet another clean tissue to protect my hands from snot while I pick up the pile? Or do I go straight in, barehanded, and wash my hands for the 28th time that day?\n\nAhhhh, but no more, thanks to a wonderful parent in our Offspring Facebook Group who showed us a better way! THIS is what a cold is going to look like from now on:\n\nPhoto: Meghan Moravcik Walbert\n\nPhoto: Meghan Moravcik Walbert\n\nThese boxes are rubber-banded together, but you could also tape them together if you can\u2019t find bands big enough to go around both of them.\n\nAre kids going to get every single dirty tissue into the empty box? Well, my kid will because he tends to be precise in these ways. Yours may still leave a stray balled-up germfest here or there, but still \u2014 it\u2019s going to be an improvement.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not advocating to throw away that box when they\u2019re all done. That\u2019s recyclable (after you remove the plastic liner). But you can open it up on one side and dump all the dirties straight into the trashcan once the germs have relinquished control of your home.", "description": "The bad news is, I\u2019ve been disposing of my son\u2019s dirty, germy tissues wrong for the whole first half of his childhood.
