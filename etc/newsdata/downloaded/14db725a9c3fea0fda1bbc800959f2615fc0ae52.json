CPS CEO Janice Jackson joined Lightfoot in a rare Sunday night news conference in which the mayor blasted the Chicago Teachers Union over the impasse in contract talks. \u201cWe are enormously disappointed that CTU cannot simply take yes for an answer,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cAs of today, we\u2019ve put everything we could \u2014 responsibly \u2014 on the table in an attempt to get a deal done, but we have no deal to announce today,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cFor that, I am terribly disappointed.\u201d\n\n\u201cCPS said as of 4 p.m., the Chicago Teachers Union said there was no possibility of a deal before the end of the day on Sunday. As a result, CPS said, it will not be possible to hold classes Monday,\u201d CBS Chicago reported late Sunday.\n\nAs a result the 361,000 K-12 students who attend public schools in Chicago will miss their eighth consecutive day of classes, disrupting the lives of parents and students alike. Twenty-five thousand teachers, members of the American Federation of Teachers\u2019 affiliated CTU, as well as an estimated 8,000 support staff, members of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) remain at strike.\n\nThe current strike is now the longest teachers strike in the city since 1987.\n\nA gap of millions of dollars separates negotiators from the CTU and the CPS. The CTU says the gap is $38 million, while the CPS claims it is $100 million, the Sun\u2013Times reported on Sunday.\n\nThe CTU has mounted an aggressive public communications campaign to attack Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s negotiation stance, especially on Twitter:\n\nLet\u2019s just cut through the spin from City Hall and get to it: The money our schools need is there. The mayor isn\u2019t bailing out CPS. She\u2019s raiding her CPS piggy bank to avoid taxing the wealthy donors who put her in office. \u2014 ChicagoTeachersUnion (@CTULocal1) October 28, 2019\n\nShe\u2019s shifting nearly $100 million out of the Chicago Public Schools budget\u2014money that should go to students and classrooms\u2014and using it to plug the budget hole for the city. \u2014 ChicagoTeachersUnion (@CTULocal1) October 28, 2019\n\n1. $60 million in a pension cost shift\n\n2. $33 million for the Chicago Police Department \u2014 ChicagoTeachersUnion (@CTULocal1) October 28, 2019\n\nThe strike has drawn attention and support from all the major Democrat candidates for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination. Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) joined the picket lines in West Chicago, declaring \u201cthe unions are how we have power.\u201d\n\nLost in the political power struggle between the teachers union and the city is the fact the academic performance of K-12 students who attend Chicago Public Schools has been well below national averages for decades, and shows little sign of improvement.", "description": "Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the Chicago Teachers Union \"cannot take yes for an answer\" as their strike moved into its eighth day.", "authors": ["Michael Patrick Leahy"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/GettyImages-1150546762-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
