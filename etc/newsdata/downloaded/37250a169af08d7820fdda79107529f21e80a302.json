Abel Tasman\u2019s party recorded seeing footprints of \u201cwild beasts having claws like a tiger\u201d in Tasmania in 1642.\n\nThe mature thylacine ranged from 100 to 130 cm long, with a tail of around 50 to 65cm, and about 60cm tall, and weighing up to 30kg. After claims the animal was attacking sheep, the Van Diemen's Land Company introduced bounties on the thylacine in 1830.\n\nFrom 1888 and 1909 the Tasmanian Government paid \u00a31 per head for dead adult thylacines and ten shillings for pups. Farmers, bounty hunters, wild dogs introduced by Europeans, destruction of habitat, disease, and the extinction of animals on which the tiger fed all contributed to the dramatic fall in the animal\u2019s population.\n\nThylacine expert Col Bailey told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he saw a Tasmanian Tiger 50 years ago on a river bank while canoeing.\n\n\u201cI'm sure they're not extinct\u2026 this (document) has shed a bit of light,\" he said.\n\nMr Bailey said the fascination with the Tasmanian Tiger was partly motivated by a sense of guilt that previous generations had driven the species to the brink of extinction, if not beyond.\n\nThe thycaline was officially declared extinct in 1982, and the DPIPWE issued a statement that for more than 50 years there have been no officially confirmed sightings of the animal. \"The Department will continue to record information on reported sightings,\u201d it added.", "description": "More than 80 years since the last thylacine in captivity died and almost 40 years since it was declared extinct,\u00a0rumours of the Tasmanian Tiger\u2019s survival have been reignited by a newly\u00a0published\u00a0document.
