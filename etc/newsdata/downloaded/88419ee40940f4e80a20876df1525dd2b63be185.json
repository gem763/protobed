Though fragile I\u2019m not going to be angry or bitter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting in touch with my MP Liz Saville Roberts for some advice.\n\n(Image: \u00c2\u00a9 Andrew Price / View Finder Pi)\n\n(Image: \u00c2\u00a9 Andrew Price / View Finder Pi)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be re-housed, just to regain the home I\u2019ve enjoyed for the last four years with my three lovely cats.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 70, a retired professional and I\u2019d like some respect for my dignity and sanity. I had a sleepless night hoping for a last minute change of mind.\u201d\n\nBefore being evicted she declared: \u201dI feel like a donkey dragged 400 miles through the Sahara then being kicked and punched instead of being able to reach the oasis for water. I\u2019m so happy here with my cats and their feline friends. My neighbours are animal lovers, too.\n\n(Image: \u00c2\u00a9 Andrew Price / View Finder Pi)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a quiet and submissive spinster just getting over a run of bad luck. I don\u2019t smoke, drink or take drugs \u2013 but the system has walked out on me. No one is helping me.\u201d\n\nOne bystander said: \u201cIt\u2019s all very sad.\u201d\n\nMP Liz Saville Roberts said: \u201cI will do everything I can to help her. No one wants to see a 70-year-old in the street.\n\n\"What she needs is some intensive support and to be able to keep her possessions.\u201d\n\n(Image: \u00c2\u00a9 Andrew Price / View Finder Pi)\n\nA spokesperson for Adra said: \"Our priority is always to support and sustain tenancies and we work with partner agencies to try and prevent homelessness.\n\n\"We only take legal action as a last resort.\n\n\"In this case, the court decided that the granting of possession was reasonable and proportionate.\"", "description": "Susan Ralphs, 70, was taken to court by a housing association over the condition of her house in Wales", "authors": ["Mari Jones", "Bradley Jolly", "Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "\u00c2", "Andrew Price", "View Finder Pi"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20579852.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-VFP_SUSAN_RALPHS_EVICTION18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
