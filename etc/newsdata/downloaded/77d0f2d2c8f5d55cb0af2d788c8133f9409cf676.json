The receiver said that he got a direct message from Brady just after the trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe DM\u2019d me when I first got traded, he said welcome and everything like that, how he was excited, and then he said if I wanted 12 I could get it and I was like, \u2018nah\u2019,\u201d Sanu said, shaking his head and smiling. \u201cYou got that. I\u2019ll change to 14.\u201d\n\nSanu was asked if he offered Brady anything for his now-iconic number.\n\n\u201cNooo,\u201d Sanu said. \u201cI just go out there and do my job and let him be great.\u201d\n\nSanu has worn No. 12 throughout his NFL career, though he wore No. 6 while at Rutgers.\n\nMohamed Sanu said that Brady offered #12 to him. Sanu\u2019s reaction was pretty good. #Patriots pic.twitter.com/bEROb8m0gS \u2014 Evan Lazar (@ezlazar) October 25, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nBrady wore No. 10 while at Michigan, but when he was drafted by the Patriots in 2000, it was the property of veteran punter Lee Johnson, and since Brady was a sixth-round pick and the fourth quarterback on the roster, it\u2019s not like he had a lot of sway to get his choice. So he got 12, and it\u2019s probably safe to say when he retires it won\u2019t be worn again in New England.\n\n\u2018He brings a lot of juice\u2019\n\nThough they haven\u2019t had much time together yet, Brady seemed happy with having Sanu join the Patriots during his Friday news conference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his willingness to embrace this opportunity,\u201d Brady said. \u201cHe brings a lot of juice. So it\u2019s good to have. It\u2019s good to see someone that\u2019s competitive. If you watch him play, he plays with an attitude. He has a little chip on his shoulder too, so I think we can relate to each other.\u201d\n\nSanu said practices have been \u201cawesome. I love it. Me and Tom are having fun out there. ...It\u2019s like we\u2019ve known each other for a while.\u201d\n\nSanu had 33 catches for 313 yards and a touchdown in seven games (six starts) with the Falcons this season.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Did Brady really offer Sanu his number?", "authors": ["Shalise Manza Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DDrCWEIrDJmlm9MoVadzMw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mebqoUttcD1mPyRu4.3Hgw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/cabb0fe0-f634-11e9-b9f2-3729a5e88496", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
