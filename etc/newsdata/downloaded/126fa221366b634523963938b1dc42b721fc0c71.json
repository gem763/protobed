It was bad politics.", "language": "en", "text": "Warren shrugged, as if to say, no biggie, live and let live. The audience whooped with delight. Warren shrugged again. Then she went in for the easy kill. \u201cAssuming,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can find one.\u201d She turned, clapped along with the audience, nodded in evident satisfaction, put palms up as if to say, what is wrong with people who just don\u2019t get it?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is tempting to ask: What is wrong with Elizabeth Warren? This was a satisfying moment, an undoubted crowd-pleaser that, as the Warren campaign exulted, had generated more than 12 million views on Twitter by the following afternoon. But it was a mistake that evoked missteps of Democratic campaigns past \u2014 a dismissiveness that Warren and her fellow candidates would do well to avoid.\n\nThis is bad politics, which may be the strongest immediate argument for shifting course, yet it is something worse than that. It reflects an attitude of intolerance and disrespect toward people of faith. Those who reasonably expect tolerance and respect should think about \u2014 well, they should think about the importance of practicing what they preach.\n\nOn the issue of equal rights for LGBTQ Americans, the country has been on an exhilarating journey of understanding and acceptance, one that reflects the best of the national charter and, more important, the national character. As a legal matter, we have progressed from a Supreme Court that in 1986 declared that it did not offend the Constitution to prosecute two men for having sex in private to a court that in 2015 found that the same Constitution in fact guaranteed the right to same-sex marriage. The court was correct the second time around.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore gratifying, the country has not resisted this legal transformation \u2014 it has embraced it. Dissenting in the marriage equality case, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. warned of a backlash. \u201cStealing this issue from the people,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwill for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept.\u201d That was incorrect. A solid majority of Americans \u2014 61 percent, according to the Pew Research Center \u2014 support the freedom to marry, including close to half \u2014 44 percent \u2014 of Republicans. To the extent there is opposition, it is, literally, dying off: Seventy-four percent of millennials favor same-sex marriage.\n\nBut, but, but. Major religions, including the Catholic Church, continue to teach that homosexual conduct is immoral and to oppose same-sex marriage. That is their right \u2014 their constitutionally protected right. Thankfully, we live in a country that both guarantees the right to marry the person you love \u2014 and protects your right to be wrong about whether that marriage should be permitted. In the years ahead, the country and the courts face the difficult task of sorting through how to balance those competing imperatives.\n\nAs that enterprise proceeds, it is important that it be conducted with the respect that Warren failed to display. And she is not alone, although her prominence in the race means her comments merit extra scrutiny. At the same forum, former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke took the extreme step of arguing that churches that oppose same-sex marriage should lose their tax exemptions \u2014 a position with which Warren later, and wisely, disagreed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost immediately, this dismissive attitude is politically dangerous. In the short term, Warren\u2019s seeming intolerance toward those whose faith rejects same-sex marriage could hurt her with African American voters. In the general election, her comments carried unsettling echoes of Democratic missteps past: Barack Obama on dispirited working-class voters who \u201ccling to guns or religion\u201d; Hillary Clinton lumping Trump supporters into a \u201cbasket of deplorables.\u201d Intolerant condescension is rarely a winning political strategy.\n\nIt\u2019s also just bad behavior. Disagree, vehemently; don\u2019t disrespect. Tell the imaginary questioner \u2014 and the millions of Americans who share his conviction \u2014 that you believe his view is misguided, intolerant, insulting. Explain why. Don\u2019t denigrate his faith, or suggest that following it makes him a loser.\n\n\u201cMy faith animates all that I do,\u201d Warren, a former Sunday school teacher, said earlier this year. I believe that, which means I believe that Warren, when she thinks it over, will do a better job of respecting those whose faith animates them in a different direction. Jesus loves all the children of the world, as she sang at the CNN forum. Even the ones who are wrong.\n\nAD", "description": "Intolerant condescension is rarely a winning political strategy.", "authors": ["Ruth Marcus", "Overseeing Washington Post Signed Opinion Content", "Writing On Domestic Politics", "Deputy Editorial Page Editor"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jnMxcQ57rmbwqYzds4hrYn1KJhI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CN5AQSXPPQI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
