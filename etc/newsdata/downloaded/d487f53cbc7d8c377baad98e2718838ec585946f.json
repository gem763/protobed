Would you like to come and see her at the after party?'\n\n(Image: Brian J Ritchie/Hotsauce/REX)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"She had her own cordoned off area and I was ushered in and I think I panicked a little bit and sort of forgot how to formulate proper sentences.\n\n\"I was like, 'What do I say? What's my opening gambit?'\n\n\"And all I could think of was that she does coconut water adverts. So my opening line was, 'I really like coconut water as well.'\n\n\"She ignored me for the rest of the night.\"\n\nActor Aaron Paul, who was sat next to Jack on the sofa, had a rather more pleasant first meeting with the Work singer.\n\nRihanna's a fan of Breaking Bad, in which Aaron starred as Jesse Pinkman alongside Bryan Cranston's Walter White.\n\nHe revealed: \"Rihanna, I had never met before and I was standing outside and this SUV stops and the door opens and Rihanna jumps out and starts running in my direction.\n\n\"I turned - Who is she running to? There's no one behind me and she throws her arms around me and kisses me on the cheek and says that she loves me.\n\n\"I'm like, 'Oh my God! I love you too! This is great!'\n\n\"She was like, 'I just needed proof of this,' and then she posed for some paparazzi and then posted this picture on Instagram , 'My life has been made, Pinkman for President!'\"", "description": "Jack made a bit of a blunder when he met the pop sensation, and it set an awkward tone for the rest of the evening", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Brian J Ritchie Hotsauce Rex", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645333.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_The-Jonathan-Ross-Show-TV-show-Series-15-Episode-6-London-UK-19-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
