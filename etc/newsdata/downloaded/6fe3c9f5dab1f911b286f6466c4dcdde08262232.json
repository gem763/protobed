This is just the beginning,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Aggarwal said global exports have risen in the past six years from zero to eight million metric tons annually. With a number of U.S.projects expected to go online in the next couple of years, export capacity could double relatively quickly.\n\n\u201cThe current market is small but there is a potential for almost 40 ships to be ordered in the next year,\u201d Mr. Aggarwal said.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe U.S. began exporting ethane via pipeline to Nova Chemicals Corp.\u2019s Sarnia plants in Canada in early 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe first seaborne ethane cargo was loaded from Norway in March 2016 to India, which has since also started taking cargoes from the U.S. The U.K, Sweden, Mexico and Brazil are also importing U.S. ethane.\n\nNorway is the only other major exporter.\n\nBig ethane carriers cost around $120 million each and are mostly made at South Korean yards\n\nAmong major exporters, Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, parent company of Sunoco Logistics Partners LP, is building a second ethane terminal in Nederland, Texas, along the U.S. Gulf Coast.\n\nThe terminal which is slated to be completed in 2020, will have the capacity to export 175,000 barrels a day, with 150,000 barrels already committed to China\u2019s Zhejiang Satellite Petrochemical Co., one of the world\u2019s biggest acrylics manufacturers.\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "description": "Ship owners are likely to order up to 40 large ethane carriers over the next 12 months as demand for the gas widely used in the petrochemical industry to make plastics and detergents steadily rises.", "authors": ["Costas Paris"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108712/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
