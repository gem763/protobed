With nine points from their first three matches Leipzig have recorded their best start to a Bundesliga season, with Werner scoring in all three games so far.\n\nALCACER GOALS\n\nBorussia Dortmund forward Paco Alcacer has been equally productive, scoring in all five of his team\u2019s games in all competitions this season. From the German Super Cup, the German Cup and the Bundesliga, the Spaniard has a haul of six goals so far, also netting once in their 3-1 loss to Union Berlin.\n\nMUELLER V MUELLER\n\nBayern Munich\u2019s 6-1 demolition of Mainz 05 was Thomas Mueller\u2019s 232nd win in 321 Bundesliga games for the club. This moved him level with club great Gerd Mueller (who played 427 league matches). Only former goalkeepers Oliver Kahn (260) and Sepp Maier (249) have won more Bundesliga matches with Bayern.\n\nOWN GOALS\n\nHertha Berlin also set a record, albeit an unwanted one, scoring two own goals in a Bundesliga game for the first time. Niklas Stark and Karim Rekik put the ball into their own net, scoring the first league goals of the season for Schalke 04, who went on to win the match 3-0.\n\nFIRST WIN\n\nIt was Schalke\u2019s first home win since January and the first league victory under new coach David Wagner this season. Hertha\u2019s new coach Ante Covic will have to wait a bit longer for his first league win in his short Bundesliga career.", "description": "Five talking points from the Bundesliga weekend:", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425303538&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810EU"}
