In Russia alone, it upgraded Aeroflot, the national airline, improved traffic flow in Moscow and improved worker safety.\n\nAnd McKinsey is far from the only American company working in legal ways with companies under sanctions. Some American officials have long argued that getting involved in the Russian economy not only benefits the American companies working there, but can also help foster better business practices and a greater appreciation for democratic principles overseas.\n\nOthers see little evidence of that. Robert G. Berschinski, a State Department official in the Obama administration, said business leaders and policymakers often believed that actively engaging with authoritarian governments would lead to economic reform, which in turn would drive political reform.\n\n\u201cBut what is becoming increasingly clear, in Russia, China and Saudi Arabia \u2014 in all three of those instances \u2014 that belief has not proven to be true,\u201d he said.\n\nChina is a prime example, argued Mr. Kramer, the former assistant secretary of state. He said the country had lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, yet companies that do business there \u201chave nothing to point to\u201d showing that Chinese people have been granted more civil or political rights.\n\nIn some cases, McKinsey\u2019s work may have made things worse.\n\nThe firm produced a report tracking how some of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most important policies were viewed by the public, singling out three individuals who drove often negative conversations on Twitter.\n\nOne was later arrested, according to a human rights group. Another said that Saudi government officials had imprisoned two of his brothers and hacked his cellphone. The third \u2014 an anonymous account \u2014 was shut down.", "description": "At a time when democracies and their basic values are increasingly under attack, the iconic American company has sometimes served clients in ways that directly counter American interests.", "authors": ["Walt Bogdanich", "Michael Forsythe"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/16/world/16mckinsey1/merlin_148099542_bf6346a9-0883-49e5-acca-d70689ee5237-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-15"}
