O'Rourke said he felt even more determined to pursue the Democratic nomination after the attack, stating, \"I can meet [Trump] on this issue in very personal terms and from a place that no one else can.\"\n\nBetween the lines: Despite a wave of promoted public appearances, O'Rourke's campaign is still considered a long shot.
