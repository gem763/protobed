Hong Kong presented its bid last month as a way to simplify trading between Asia and Europe and boost China\u2019s participation in the global financial markets. London rejected the unsolicited bid within two days, citing \u201clack of strategic merit.\u201d Hong Kong had until October 9 to solidify its offer. (Financial Times)\n\nTalking point: The merger would have created the third-biggest exchange in the world based on the value of listed companies, after the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. But the offer came with a few sticking points for London: it was conditional on the exchange abandoning plans to buy Refinitiv, a U.S. financial data provider. London also cited concerns with the Hong Kong government\u2019s control over its stock market. The offer came amid strife in Hong Kong stemming from concern around Beijing\u2019s growing influence over the territory. The HKEX said Tuesday it plans to revive the deal in the future, but the merger could face regulatory challenges.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
