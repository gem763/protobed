The city\u2019s top cop plans to skip the speech, even though he\u2019s hosting the event.\n\nPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson\u2019s apparent snub of Trump\u2019s speech Monday at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference is the latest chapter in a long and contentious relationship between the Republican president and the nation\u2019s third-largest city, a Democratic stronghold. \u201cThe values of the people of Chicago are more important to him than anything that could be discussed at that speech,\u201d Johnson\u2019s spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said shortly after the White House announced Trump\u2019s planned address at the conference.\n\nGuglielmi added that Johnson will be hosting and attending several events at the conference.\n\nSince his campaign, Trump has repeatedly singled out the city, both for what he says is its unwillingness to get tough on criminals and what he complains is a willingness to coddle immigrants living in the country illegally. Protesters and supporters had clashed even before he made it to the stage during a planned campaign rally in the city in 2016 \u2014 Trump eventually left without making a speech.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Trump took great pleasure when then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel concluded there was nothing he could do about the letters, no matter how \u201carchitecturally tasteless\u201d they were. Trump blamed the Chicago Tribune\u2019s architecture critic for stirring up opposition about the signage, calling him a \u201cthird-rate architectural critic.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Trump has used the city\u2019s surge in gun violence to call for a crackdown on criminals. \u201cWhat the hell is going on in Chicago?\u201d he asked at a 2017 rally in Florida. \u201cThere are those who say that Afghanistan is safer than Chicago, OK?\u2026 You know what\u2019s wrong with Chicago? Weak, ineffective politicians. Democrats \u2026\u201d\n\nIn another rally that year, Trump singled out Emanuel, telling the audience: \u201cBetter tell that mayor to get tough because it\u2019s not working what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nTrump has even suggested that Chicago should embrace the stop-and-frisk policing method in which large numbers of people are temporarily detained, questioned and sometimes searched for drugs even after it was deemed unconstitutional.\n\nHe has spoken numerous times about an unnamed Chicago police officer who lamented that the department could stop the violence if they let officers do their job. That story, depending on the telling, has the officer saying police could clean things up in \u201cimmediately,\u201d \u201din one week,\u201d or \u201ctwo days.\u201d\n\nTrump tweeted in early 2017 that he would \u201csend in the Feds\u201d if \u201cChicago doesn\u2019t fix the horrible \u2018carnage\u2019 going on.\u201d Johnson responded by saying he didn\u2019t know what Trump was suggesting he was going to do, and Emanuel rejected the president\u2019s offer if that offer was to send in the National Guard.\n\nThe president has made false assertions about gun violence in Chicago, starting with his contention during his campaign that the city has the toughest gun laws in the United States. By the time Trump the candidate was making that assertion in 2015, many of the city\u2019s gun laws had either been overturned or gutted. Then, shortly after he was inaugurated in 2017, he claimed two people were fatally shot during former President Barack Obama\u2019s farewell address a few weeks earlier.\n\nThe Tribune reported that its own database showed \u201cno slayings for about 24 hours before or after Obama\u2019s speech.\u201d\n\nA reference to the city made it into a statement former Trump attorney Michael Cohen released earlier this year before an appearance in front of the U.S. House. He spoke of Trump driving through a struggling Chicago neighborhood and remarking that only black people could live that way.\n\nChicago also has taken a leading role in the president\u2019s battle with so-called sanctuary cities. After a federal appeals court ruled that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions cold not tie the distribution of federal grant money to cities\u2019 willingness to cooperate with immigration authorities, a federal judge ruled in favor of the city in its lawsuit over the Justice Department\u2019s attempt to tie the money to new immigration requirements, including giving federal agents access to local jails. But just a few months ago, a federal appeals judge ruled that the Justice Department could give preferential treatment in awarding community policing grants to cities that cooperate with immigration authorities.\n\nWhen Trump later said he was strongly considering placing \u201cIllegal immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only,\u201d Emanuel quickly shot back that Chicago would \u201cwelcome these migrants with open arms.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s announcement about the conference comes just days after he told reporters that he was ordering an internal investigation of himself after he was found asleep in his SUV at a stop sign. Officers let him drive home without a roadside sobriety test. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Johnson acknowledged to her that he\u2019d had \u201ca couple drinks with dinner.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Trump is visiting Chicago, a city he has long criticized, for the first time as President.
