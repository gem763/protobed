Porsche\u2014a subsidiary of the iconic sports car maker\u2014to help make \u201ca spaceship on the water,\u201d according to the Austria-based design agency.\n\n\n\nThe 135-foot yacht was officially listed earlier this month, with a price on application, according to the brokers, Camper & Nicholsons.\n\n\n\nMore: Billionaire Selling the \u2018Starfighter\u2019 of Superyachts\n\nThe modern interiors feature soft, curving edges and a palette of white, black and blue. Camper & Nicholsons\n\nThe superyacht, known as Royal Falcon One, features a catamaran design, a style whereby two parallel hulls act like legs, lifting the whole ship off the water. Royal Falcon Fleet CEO and president M A Zaman has said the unorthodox shape is meant to differentiate the yacht from its peers.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn St. Tropez or Fort Lauderdale, you see 20 or 30 or 40 megayachts standing there pretty much looking the same,\u201d Mr. Zaman said from London\u2019s Superyacht Design Week in 2014. \u201cUnless you look at the name of the boat you don\u2019t see the difference.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe catamaran design is also functional by allowing the bedroom suites a more luxurious position at or above the main deck rather than below, the way standard monohull yachts are often arranged, he told SuperyachtNews.\n\n\n\nTrue to Mr. Zaman\u2019s word, Royal Falcon houses three guest cabins on the main deck, while the master suite and a so-called \u201cVIP suite\u201d on the upper deck, giving them loftier views over the water, according to the listing with Camper & Nicholsons. Instead, the two hulls are used to house cabins for the ship\u2019s 10-person crew.\n\n\n\nA roof deck with a Jacuzzi and seating Camper & Nicholsons\n\nBuilt in Sweden, the fuel-efficient superyacht has a cruising speed of 15 knots and can top out at about 35 knots, according to the listing agents.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Track-Only Supercars: The Top Rung in Exclusivity\n\nInside, Studio F.A. Porsche imbued the lavish interiors with a bit of space-age modernism, including freeform leather sofas, a clean color palette of whites, grays and blacks and automatic sliding glass doors. The designers employed smooth lines and curved, organic edges recognizable in Porsche\u2019s iconic automobiles, images show.\n\n\n\nRoyal Falcon One also houses a range of luxurious amenities, including a top deck with a Jacuzzi; a main saloon with a back-lit bar and panoramic observation deck; as well as a private open-air deck off the master suite, according to the listing.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-122218?size=1.7777777777777777&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
