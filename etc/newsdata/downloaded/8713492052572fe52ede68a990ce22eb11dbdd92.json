It's there that she changes her identity and takes on the name Sister Mary Clarence. She ultimately becomes the church's choir director and helps transform the chorus before singing for the Pope.\n\n\"Sister Act\" was released in 1992 when movie soundtracks were standalone bodies of work, and is still considered iconic today.\n\nGoldberg is also working on another project, which requires the platinum white head of faux locs she is wearing. She underwent a transformation in September for her role in Stephen King's limited series \"The Stand\" as 108-year-old Mother Abigail.\n\nEvery episode of ABC's award-winning talk show \"The View\" is now available as a podcast!
