Possible proofs from ENDGAME. Endgame\u2019s scene no one noticed,\u2019 they wrote. Consider us intrigued.\n\nThey cite a scene near the end of the movie, which sees a hologram of Tony speak to Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his daughter Morgan (Lexi Rabe) from beyond the grave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it\u2019s assumed he recorded the unique message to say goodbye to his family for him in the event of his death, the fan was suspicious about the way the hologram makes eye contact with Morgan, with its eyes darting between his wife and child.\n\n\u2018How would Tony know that Morgan would be sitting on the Sofa when Pepper and Morgan would be watching the Hologram and also how would he know the location from where the hologram was getting projected?\u2019 they asked.\n\nThe fan referenced the tragic hologram scene (Picture: Marvel)\n\n\u2018Not just the location but how would a 3D hologram make an eye contact with a human (Morgan). How would Tony know the locations before recording?\u2019\n\nWith the fan theorising that a version of Tony\u2019s brain was backed up in his helmet, they went on to point out that it\u2019s entirely possible after an Iron Man AI was introduced in the 2015 Ironheart comic books.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t put it past him TBH.\n\nHe might return to screens in the Black Widow movie (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nDespite it being tempting to bring the beloved character back by any means, fans might see this as a bit of a cop-out after such an apt ending for him.\n\nIt\u2019s already been claimed that Robert could be set to return to screens as Tony in the Black Widow movie as the film takes place after Civil War but before Infinity War.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, we could actually see the star come back as an AI after sources told We Got This Covered that Marvel is keen to explore the story of Riri Williams\u2019 Ironheart.\n\nSo never fear guys, Tony could be back before we know it.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
