It was particularly developed in the Middle Ages, when plants were often used for medicinal purposes and people needed to be able to tell safe from poisonous plants. A lot of plant families contain both. For instance, the nightshade family of plants includes Belladonna, a poisonous plant, and also edibles like tomatoes, peppers and eggplants.\n\nExplorers often brought a botanical artist along to record the plants encountered. During \u201cTulip Mania\u201d in 17th century Holland, when rare bulbs sold for the equivalent of an average person\u2019s annual salary, it was crucial for collectors and breeders to record each flower\u2019s unique patterns and contours.\n\nAnd botanical art can be about more than accuracy.\n\nOften, the story a botanical illustration tells is more mesmerizing than the perfection of the drawing itself, says Bynum.\n\n\u201cWhat I learned doing this book is that you don\u2019t have to be a great artist to get things down on paper in a way that can communicate to other people,\u201d she says.\n\nRobin Jess runs the Botanical Art and Illustration program at the New York Botanical Garden, the oldest certificate program in the subject in the country.\n\n\u201cWe tend to be very accurate, and to pay attention to all the details. We require that students take classes in plant morphology, so they understand what it is exactly that they are drawing. It requires a strong basis in botany,\u201d she explains.\n\nThe garden is also the headquarters of the American Society of Botanical Artists, with about 1,800 members.\n\n\u201cContemporary botanical artists share a concern for the environment, particularly in light of climate change, as well as for drawing attention to plants,\u201d Jess explains.\n\nBefore photography was invented, botanical illustrations were essential to understanding plants. But today, too, drawings can illuminate aspects of plants in a way photos cannot.\n\n\u201cAn illustration can show various parts of a plant at the same time, something a photo really can\u2019t. It can show extra details of the fruit, for example, and what it looks like bisected,\u201d Jess explains.\n\nAnd making botanical illustrations for a patron is alive and well, she points out. Florilegia - documentation of all the plants growing in a specific garden - is a big thing right now, she says.\n\n\u201cFrom a florilegium of a small herb garden in Minneapolis to a complete florilegium of Alcatraz, they\u2019re really drawing a lot of attention,\u201d Jess says.\n\nPrince Charles recently commissioned a florilegium of one of his properties, she says. He invited top botanical artists from around the world to come to his property and paint. The resulting work, says Jess, is \u201cjust fabulous.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Think of botanical illustrators, and you might envision a world of medieval herbalists, tulip or orchid collectors, or affluent young women of the 17th and 18th centuries making detailed drawings and watercolors of garden plants.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Katherine Roth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/gardening_botanical_art_07136_c0-323-3652-2452_s1770x1032.jpg?d72447af7478521e9f5536156aca6a59c646f220", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
