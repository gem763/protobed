Against a basket of currencies it hit a month low of 97.898 overnight and was steady around that level on Thursday.\n\nThe Aussie jumped to $0.6785 after figures showed joblessness unexpectedly contracting a bit last month, taking some pressure off the central bank to further reduce interest rates in November.\n\n\"This is just what the doctor ordered,\" said CommSec Chief Economist Craig James.\n\n\"There is no reason for the Reserve Bank to cut rates again in November \u2013 giving the central bank more time to gauge the effectiveness of early rate reductions.\"\n\nLingering worries about trade tensions between the United States and China kept a lid on gains for trade-exposed currencies, though.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar rose marginally to sit at $0.6294, not far from a four-year low hit two weeks ago.\n\nChina's yuan weakened slightly to 7.0975 per dollar, while the safe-haven Swiss franc rose almost 0.2% to 0.9934 per dollar.
