Play Pass will be coming to countries outside the US \"soon.\" You'll be able to try out Google's Play Pass service with a 10-day free trial. And if you sign up in the first couple weeks after launch, Play Pass will cost $2 per month for 12 months before you're switched to the full $5 per month pricing.\n\nSubscribers will also be able to share their Google Play Pass subscription with up to five family members at no extra cost.\n\nSome of the more well-known apps and games available in Google's Play Pass at launch include \"Stardew Valley,\" \"Terraria,\" \"Monument Valley,\" \"Risk,\" \"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic,\" Facetune, and AccuWeather.

And we think as long as we're doing that, Google will win too.\"\n\nWith that said, developers can choose to make their apps or games exclusive to the Google Play Pass program in the Google Play Store, but they're not required to do so.\n\nAntonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nWhat's in it for developers?\n\nThrough Google Play Pass, developers earn royalties based on the amount of time spent in their apps, and Google will be \"continuously refining the model to make sure developers are rewarded fairly,\" Shoemaker said.\n\nDevelopers also get useful and valuable data, too. Without the payment barrier, developers can see what features people like when they're not obstructed by paywalls. \"It's all about trying to identify what content is really making users happy and delivering value so that they are satisfied with the overall experience,\" Shoemaker said.\n\nAnd without a payment barrier, Shoemaker said that Play Pass can free developers from monetization pressures, and it gives them greater freedom to create better apps and experiences.\n\nWithout a payment barrier, Play Pass subscribers may be more willing to try lesser-known paid apps and games that they wouldn't have paid for out of uncertainty. Google highlighted certain less-familiar titles in its Play Pass announcement blog like \"LIMBO,\" \"Lichtspeer,\" \"Mini Metro,\" and \"Old Man's Journey.\"\n\nGoogle Play Pass Subscribers will find a new Play Pass tab \u2014 it looks like a Google-branded movie ticket \u2014 on the bottom of the Google Play Store where they'll be able to browse apps and games. Apps and games in the Google Play Pass program will also have the Play Pass ticket symbol when you browse normally through the Google Play Store.", "description": "Google's Play Pass lets you roam freely in a short list of paid apps and games without any payment barriers or ads, and the list will grow over time.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d88cf462e22af121f4c1e23-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
