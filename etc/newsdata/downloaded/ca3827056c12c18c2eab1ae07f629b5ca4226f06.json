The Steelers are winless through two weeks for just the second time since 2002 due in part to an inability to get necessary stops. New England lit them up in a 30-point blowout in the opener and Seattle scored three second-half touchdowns last Sunday to win in Pittsburgh for the first time in 20 years.\n\nWhile the Steelers did produce a pair of turnovers deep in Seahawks territory - including a fumble recovery by rookie linebacker Devin Bush in the fourth quarter that let the Steelers get within two with 5:34 to go - they also let Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson run around enough to run out the clock.\n\nEnter Fitzpatrick, who grew frustrated with his role with the struggling Dolphins. He moved all over the field in Miami, playing everything from safety to cornerback to nickel-back to linebacker in dime packages.\n\nHe declined to get into specifics about what went wrong with the Dolphins and said he\u2019s fine doing whatever Steelers coach Mike Tomlin asks.\n\nTomlin said he plans to play Fitzpatrick exclusively at free safety on Sunday when Pittsburgh visits San Francisco (2-0). Whether Tomlin actually sticks to the plan or will be tempted to experiment with Fitzpatrick remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cI think right now it\u2019s important to anchor me down because I\u2019m learning an entirely new system,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cOnce I learn the system more, I\u2019ll be able to move around a little bit. It\u2019s part of my game. It\u2019s one of the reasons they wanted me around.\u201d\n\n49ers coach Kyle Shanahan called it \u201cvery hard\u201d for any player to be effective after just three practices with a new team but added that Fitzpatrick is \u201ca different dude mentally,\u201d one who probably won\u2019t take long to get up to speed in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Steelers have had issues with communication in the early going, with blown coverages leading to three touchdowns against the Patriots.\n\nThings were a bit better against the Seahawks, but Seattle still piled up 425 yards. While stressing \u201cfootball is football,\u201d Fitzpatrick allowed getting a crash course in the terminology is going to take a not insignificant amount of effort.\n\n\u201cJust got to learn and simplify the game so I can go out there and play fast,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cA lot of it is word association.\u201d\n\nThe trade re-unites him in a way with safety Terrell Edmunds. The two worked out together in Florida while prepping for the 2018 draft. Both went in the first round, with Fitzpatrick going to Miami with the 11th pick and the Steelers grabbing Edmunds with the 28th selection. While Edmunds admitted he was surprised when Pittsburgh moved aggressively to bring Fitzpatrick in, it didn\u2019t take long for Fitzpatrick to provide a reminder of why the Steelers coveted him 18 months ago.\n\n\u201cOf course you could see that he\u2019s smart out there,\u201d Edmunds said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to communicate the best way he can. He\u2019s getting comfortable out there. First day, he didn\u2019t really have many mistakes, if any. We was just out there playing ball.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh needs cohesion to materialize quickly. The Steelers will head west this weekend without quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who is out for the season with a right elbow injury. Roethlisberger\u2019s absence gives the defense less margin for error. Fitzpatrick\u2019s arrival could help ease some of the burden. Either way, the Steelers are aware they need to get better, quickly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get the wins,\u201d Edmunds said. \u201cThat\u2019s the mindset to get the wins and we haven\u2019t been playing well enough all around.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Minkah Fitzpatrick walked into the locker room fresh off the first practice of the rest of his football life, noticed the semi-circle of cameras and microphones running three deep around his locker and took a step back while his new teammates roared in laughter.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Will Graves"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/steelers_fitzpatrick_football_92827_c0-126-3000-1875_s1770x1032.jpg?85e3f3a90d2b6cb216aa7875ca9e51bf768c5416", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
