Other sectors are calling for a national strike on Wednesday.\n\nEcuadorians say abolishing fuel subsidies has also led to rising prices for consumer goods. About 20 people have been arrested for raising food prices, the government said.\n\nThey had been overcharging for products such as corn, onions, carrots and potatoes, which are subject to price controls, the authorities said.\n\n\"There is no justification for raising the prices,\" Interior Minister Maria Romo said.\n\nOne man died in the Andean province of Azuay in the south of the country, the government said. Reports said roadblocks in the area had stopped an ambulance from reaching him after he was hit by a car.\n\nHow significant is the indigenous groups' action?\n\nSome of the road blockages have affected petrol deliveries, leading to fuel shortages in parts of the country.\n\nThey have affected routes including the main north-south highway in the country.\n\nIn some places, protesters threw stones and rocks, clashing with security forces who fired tear gas.\n\nAn umbrella group for indigenous groups in the country, the Confederation of Indigenous Nations in Ecuador (Conaie) said it was declaring a \"state of exception\" in indigenous areas, where soldiers and police officers would be detained and would face \"indigenous justice\".\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Protesters block a road in Cangahua near the capital Quito\n\nLuis Iguamba, leader of the Kayambi people from northern Ecuador, said they would keep up the pressure on the government.\n\n\"We are fighting for everyone and we are fighting to foresee the rights we all have and we can't allow this. So, everyone, be on the lookout and keep up the fight. Let's radicalise the strike,\" he said.\n\nSchools are to remain closed in Andean areas of the country because of the protests, EFE news agency quoted the education minister as saying.\n\nThe BBC's Americas Editor Candace Piette says indigenous-led protests have toppled three presidents in the last few decades.\n\nTheir intervention follows protests on Thursday and Friday that saw roads in the capital Quito and the city of Guayaquil strewn with makeshift barricades and burning tyres.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tear gas fired as protests flare in Ecuador\n\nHundreds of people were arrested, dozens of police officers hurt, several police cars destroyed and a local government building was attacked, the authorities said.\n\nWhy did the president scrap the subsidies?\n\nMr Moreno said the fuel subsidies, which cost the government $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) annually, were no longer affordable.\n\nThe elimination of the fuel subsidies, introduced in the 1970s, are part of Mr Moreno's plan to shore up Ecuador's flagging economy and ease its debt burden.\n\nEcuador's government has agreed to cut public spending as part of a loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe agreement, signed in March, allows Ecuador to borrow $4.2bn (\u00a33.4bn).\n\nOn Tuesday, Ecuador announced it was leaving the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to pump more oil and raise revenues.", "description": "About 50 police officers have been taken hostage in various areas around the country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4EB8/production/_109125102_hi057128352.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
