Demonstrators are demanding greater economic equality and better public services in a country long seen as an economic success story. Shops have been vandalized and buildings set on fire, shutting down numerous subway stations.\n\n\u201cThis has been a very difficult decision that causes us great pain,\u201d Pi\u00f1era said in a televised address. \u201cA president always has to put the needs of his countrymen first.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Under the tentative deal, the U.S. had agreed to suspend plans to raise tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports, and Beijing had agreed to step up purchases of U.S. farm products.\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley said U.S. officials were \u201cawaiting potential information regarding another location,\u201d but it was unclear if any had been proposed. Gidley added that Trump wanted to sign the deal with China \u201cwithin the same time frame,\u201d hinting that a separate event could occur outside a summit.\n\nThe so-called Phase One trade agreement did little to address the underlying U.S. grievances against China, including its alleged practice of forcing foreign firms to hand over trade secrets; stealing technology, and unfairly subsidizing Chinese firms. China\u2019s leaders have been reluctant to make the kind of policy reforms that would satisfy Washington, worrying such concessions would mean scaling back their aspirations to become a world leader in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars.\n\nStill, the apparent cancellation of the summit \u201cremoves a hard deadline for action toward a comprehensive agreement in the trade war,\u201d said Jeff Moon, a former U.S. diplomat and trade official specializing in China who is now president of the China Moon Strategies consultancy. \u201cThat hard deadline and the relatively short period of time available allowed Trump and Xi to give themselves permission to do only easy things and delay indefinitely resolving tough issues.\u201d\n\nNow, Moon said, \u201cthere is no excuse for not pressing forward with the full U.S. agenda of concerns.\u201d\n\nClimate advocates said they were disappointed but expected to relocate their talks. The Santiago climate conference was meant to work out some of the remaining unresolved rules for countries on climate efforts, smoothing the way for the bigger effort in the 2020 summit: encouraging countries to up their commitments to cutting climate-changing emissions.\n\n\u201cThe absence of rules does not stop countries from acting either alone or together\u201d to cut emissions, said Nigel Purvis, a climate and environment negotiator in the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. \u201cIt really shouldn\u2019t slow down climate action.\u201d\n\nBut other climate experts said it was important to get those rules worked out in advance.\n\n\u201cTo load everything into one conference \u2014 I think they\u2019ll work pretty hard not to do that,\u201d said Henry Jacoby, a climate expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nRachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said she believed there would be \u201cevery effort made that some type of \u2026 meeting does happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese \u2026 are the venues where the global community comes together to decide how to tackle this problem together,\u201d she said. \u201cThe climate challenge requires every country to act, but it requires us to act collectively.\u201d\n\nU.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa issued a statement saying that \u201calternative hosting options\u201d were being explored. And a U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to comment publicly, said that all U.N. venues are being considered as options. Those would include cities such as New York, Geneva, Bonn, Vienna and Nairobi.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ellen Knickmeyer and Paul Wiseman in Washington, and Frank Jordans in Berlin, contributed to this story.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Chile's president said he is canceling two major international summits so he can respond to nationwide protests over economic inequality.", "authors": ["Michael Weissenstein"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/chile-protests.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C98px%2C2560px%2C1340px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
