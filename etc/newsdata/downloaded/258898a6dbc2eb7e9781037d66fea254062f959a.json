There are enormous economic advantages that we will have, as Indonesia grows, into the future.\n\n\u201cThey are building a new capital city, all of that means jobs \u2013 for Australian infrastructure companies, for Australian steel, for Australian engineers, Australian architects, Australian planners, Australian legal officers and service deliverers. There is enormous opportunity as a result of this agreement, which will see \u2013 on the one hand 2% of Indonesian goods into Australia, goods and services, become tariff free, and in return, 25% of Australian goods and services into Indonesia, a growing market, will be tariff free.\u201d\n\nAlbanese said he would not speak for the trade union movement, but he believed Labor had addressed its main fears in demanding changes to the agreement, in exchange for its support.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing is fighting for Australian jobs and we have written to the government making a number of demands consistent with what the unions want,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cConsistent with protecting Australian jobs, consistent with ensuring privatisation is ruled out, consistent with making sure there can be no replacement of Australian workers with foreign workers. They are our demands. I expect they will be met and when they are met, these agreements when approved will be good for Australian jobs.\u201d\n\nMorrison told the Liberal party council meeting on Saturday he expected to be able to assure Widodo that Australia was \u201cabsolutely on track\u201d with ratifying the trade agreement, which was also expected to go ahead in Indonesia, following Widodo\u2019s re-election.\n\nMorrison will speak about the trade opportunities from the deals involving Indonesia at a barbecue lunch with business leaders from the Indonesian Employers\u2019 Association, Indonesia-Australia Business Council and local community, and officials from the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n\nHe is also seeking other bilateral meetings during the day-long visit. Leaders or senior officials from at least 18 countries are attending the inauguration. These include the leaders of Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam, Myanmar and the Philippines, and the vice-premier of China.\n\nAdditional reporting by Australian Associated Press", "description": "PM to attend Joko Widodo\u2019s inauguration and hold talks on FTA, which opposition leader says will be good for jobs", "authors": ["Amy Remeikis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a7dbcabf603fdfc6b890aba81c796458bcc516d/519_354_3444_2066/master/3444.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a595ecf1c6ccbef16495fd64de64b722", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
