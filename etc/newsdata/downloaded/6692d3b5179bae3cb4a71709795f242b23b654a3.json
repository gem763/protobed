At the same time, things don't always work out as planned, or at least not right away.\n\nThat's why, when looking for stocks that Wall Street has supreme confidence in, we need to add a bit of secret sauce to our stock screening, and protect our investment by ensuring that even if a stock does not go up, we still get paid.\n\nHow do we do that in practice? By screening for stocks highly recommended by professional analysts (\"strong buy\"), expected to deliver powerful profits (with \"target prices\" 20% or more above today's price) -- and also paying an above-market dividend yield.\n\nFortunately, the Stock Screener at TipRanks permits you to do all three of these things at once. Here are three such strong buy-rated suggestions we recently came across.\n\nGeneral Motors: 30.53% Upside, 4.1% Dividend Yield\n\nGeneral Motors (GM \u2013 Get Report) stock has been getting a lot of bad press of late, now that the United Auto Workers (UAW) union has called its first strike against the company in more than a decade. And yet, in a recent note, 4-star Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas supported the stock, arguing that GM is in a better financial condition to survive a strike that it's been in the past.\n\n\"While the situation remains fluid and can weigh on the shares short term, we strongly believe labor/strike disruption presents an excellent buying opportunity for GM shares,\" Jonas noted.\n\nBarclays analyst Brian Johnson added, \"While the UAW has plenty in reserves to fund an extended strike (albeit, with workers receiving significantly less than their normal compensation) our base case is that the walk-out is more of a token strike meant to convey a message to General Motors and the industry, vs a more prolonged event.\"\n\nBoth Jonas and Johnson reiterated an Overweight rating on GM stock with price targets of $51 and $46, respectively. (To watch the analysts' track records, click here)\n\nEven sitting here on the wrong side of the automotive cycle, GM held its sales decline to less than 2% last quarter -- and its profits actually increased 1%!\n\nOn average, Street analysts predict GM shares could rise as much as 30.53% over the next 12 months, and with a dividend yield of 4.1%, we agree that GM stock looks attractive.\n\nNutrien: 26% Upside, 3.6% Dividend yield\n\nAnother stock facing negative headlines is Nutrien (NTR \u2013 Get Report), one the world's biggest players in the production and sale of potash, nitrogen, and phosphate fertilizers.\n\nAmerica's long, wet spring made it hard for farmers to get crops in the ground in time to enjoy a full growing season, and as a result, the fields here in the Midwest today are mostly populated with stalks of awfully short-looking corn. That bodes poorly for farmers come harvest-time -- and for their ability to invest heavily in fertilizers and agricultural equipment for next year's crop. On the other hand, they may not have much choice but to fertilize in 2020 if they're to make up for crop shortfalls in 2019.\n\nLast month, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Byrne upgraded shares of Nutrien on the belief that agriculture stocks such as Nutrien could make for good defensive plays if the economy turns south. But defense isn't the only way to play Nutrien. In fact, on average, most analysts who look at the stock see a potential target price as much as 26% above where Nutrien stock trades today. With the stock trading for less than 10 times trailing earnings, and paying a rich 3.6% dividend yield, that looks like a smart call.
