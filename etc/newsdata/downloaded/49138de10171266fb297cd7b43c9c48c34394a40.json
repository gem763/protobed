REUTERS/Sekar Nasly\n\nContributing factors to the crash of the new Boeing (BA.N) jet, which killed all 189 on board, included incorrect assumptions on how an anti-stall device called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) functioned and how pilots would react, slides in the presentation showed.\n\nThe briefing slides showed that a lack of documentation about how systems would behave in a crash scenario, including the activation of a \u201cstick shaker\u201d device that warned pilots of a dangerous loss of lift, also contributed.\n\n\u201cDeficiencies\u201d in the flight crew\u2019s communication and manual control of the aircraft contributed as well, the slides showed, as did alerts and distractions in the cockpit.\n\nThe deficiencies had been \u201cidentified during training,\u201d the slides said, without elaborating.\n\nReliance on a single angle-of-attack sensor made MCAS more vulnerable to failure, while the sensor on the plane that crashed had been miscalibrated during an earlier repair, according to the slides.\n\nThe final report will be released on Friday.\n\nSome relatives of the victims at the briefing in Jakarta expressed disappointment that direct responsibility wasn\u2019t assigned.\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t the airline heavily sanctioned?\u201d said Anton Sahadi, 30, whose relatives Riyan Aryandi and Muhammad Rafi Andrian were killed in the crash. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about one or two lives, it\u2019s about 189 lives.\u201d\n\nThe role of the civil investigators is not to assign blame but to draw lessons that will make flying safer. Separate court actions will address who is legally responsible for the crash.\n\nOny Soerjo Wibowo, an investigator with Indonesia\u2019s National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) who delivered the briefing, declined to comment afterward. An agency representative also declined to comment.\n\nA representative for Lion Air declined to comment.\n\nA Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment on the briefing, saying: \u201cAs the report hasn\u2019t been officially released by the authorities, it is premature for us to comment on its contents.\u201d\n\nThe 737 MAX was grounded worldwide after a second deadly crash in Ethiopia in March 2019.\n\nPlanemaker Boeing is under growing pressure to explain what it knew about 737 MAX problems before the aircraft entered service.\n\nBoeing has already said it would redesign the MCAS anti-stall system to rely on more than a single sensor and to help reduce pilot workload.\n\nThe planemaker is set to release third-quarter financial results on Wednesday.\n\nLION AIR FLIGHT\n\nContact with Lion Air flight 610 was lost 13 minutes after it took off on Oct. 29 from the capital, Jakarta, heading north to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang.\n\nThe Boeing 737 MAX airplane had suffered a sequence of problems in cockpit readings since Oct. 26, culminating in a decision to change the angle-of-attack sensor before the penultimate flight from Denpasar to Jakarta.\n\nDuring the fatal night-time flight, a \u201cstick shaker\u201d was vibrating the captain\u2019s controls, warning of a stall throughout most of the 13 minutes aloft, based on what investigators believe to have been erroneous data on the attitude of the wings relative to the direction of flight, called the angle of attack.\n\nThe angle must be controlled so that the aircraft\u2019s wings maintain lift and avoid stalling, a condition in which a plane will begin to fall out of the sky.\n\nThe airplane\u2019s anti-stall system repeatedly pushed the nose of the aircraft down, which is how pilots usually get air under the wings.\n\nBoeing was widely criticized for placing emphasis on piloting and maintenance issues in its public response to an earlier report, sparking a furious dispute with Lion Air co-founder Rusdi Kirana.\n\nThe planemaker has since acknowledged that MCAS and a faulty angle of attack sensor played a role, and apologized for lives lost without admitting formal responsibility.\n\nBoeing last month settled the first claims stemming from the Lion Air crash, a U.S. plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer said.\n\nThree other sources told Reuters the families of those killed will receive at least $1.2 million each.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe manufacturer faces nearly 100 lawsuits over the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10, which killed all 157 people on board the flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi.\n\nThe 737 MAX was grounded following the second crash, leaving Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grappling to contain a crisis that has left 346 people dead, forced airlines to ground more than 300 aircraft, and put Boeing deliveries worth more than $500 billion on hold.\n\nBoeing on Tuesday ousted the top executive of its commercial airplanes division, Kevin McAllister, marking the first high-level departure from the planemaker since two fatal crashes.", "description": "Mechanical and design issues contributed to the crash of a Lion Air 737 MAX jet last October, Indonesian investigators told victims' families in a briefing on Wednesday ahead of the release of a final report.", "authors": ["Jessica Damiana", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444013647&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0A2", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
