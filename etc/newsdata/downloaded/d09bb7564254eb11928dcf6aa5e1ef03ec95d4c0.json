The pain in her back and abdomen has become so bad that she sleeps only two hours a night, according to her declaration.\n\nAnother woman from the Congo said that after experiencing severe leg and back pain while being detained in Karnes, a doctor in San Antonio told her there was a 90% chance she had cancer but that an additional biopsy was needed to confirm the diagnosis. Yet, since that appointment in early September, she told RAICES lawyers, she was put back in detention and has not been taken to a hospital.\n\n\u201cI am having problems sleeping and am exhausted,\u201d she said in the declaration, adding that she has been detained since June. \u201cI am very worried about my health.\u201d\n\nRAICES spoke with 800 women who experienced some type of medical issue while being held at the 29-acre property in South Texas, which can hold roughly 1,300 people and is surrounded by 15-foot fences. Lawyers heard stories of immigrants who haven\u2019t received treatment for complications involving miscarriages and who have mental health issues that are going untreated.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard so many women talk to us about wanting to kill themselves. It\u2019s only a matter of time before someone dies at Karnes. Andrea Meza, director of family detention services at RAICES\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard so many women talk to us about wanting to kill themselves,\u201d said Andrea Meza, the director of family detention services at RAICES. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before someone dies at Karnes.\u201d\n\nKarnes, which is typically used for family detention but has been holding women for the past six months, is expected to start detaining parents and their children again as early as next week. Immigration advocates told HuffPost that since the facility has failed to provide adults with adequate medical care, the conditions will be even more dangerous for vulnerable children.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement \u201cis knowingly endangering migrants with the goal of deterring immigration at the southern border,\u201d said Dana Gold, senior counsel at the Government Accountability Project. Gold represents two doctors who became whistleblowers after inspecting family detention centers for the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite unconscionable.\u201d\n\nICE did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment on the declarations.\n\nThe lack of medical and psychiatric care in detention facilities and Border Patrol stations run by DHS is a widespread issue. Since December, six minors have died in federal custody, in many cases due to illnesses that were not properly treated and turned lethal.\n\nThe unsanitary conditions in overcrowded Border Patrol stations where children could not brush their teeth or bathe regularly made headlines this summer, and in June, HuffPost wrote about a severely ill pregnant mother of two whom ICE detained and threatened to deport.\n\nIn 2018, the two doctors who inspected family detention centers on behalf of the DHS office publicized their findings after they found children who had lost significant amounts of weight \u2015 in one case, a sick 16-month-old who lost almost 32% of his body mass over 10 days and was never given IV fluids or sent to an emergency room \u2015 and kids who had been given adult doses of a vaccine. They said the medical facilities and staffing were inadequate and that trauma-informed care was not being provided to children and their parents.\n\nJim Forsyth/Reuters The Karnes County Residential Center, shown here in 2014, was intended to be a detention center specifically for mothers recently arriving from Central America with children.\n\nThough there are systemic problems with the medical offices in detention centers, experts say the bigger issue is that children and adults should not be detained in the first place. They told HuffPost that everything from the use of solitary confinement to the bright lights that are left on during the night and the lack of healthful food exacerbates an immigrant\u2019s health problems.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a larger punitive approach that doesn\u2019t align with our mission to care for patients,\u201d said Dr. Altaf Saadi, a neurologist and an asylum evaluator for the Physicians for Human Rights Asylum Network, about medical services in detention centers. \u201cHealth is not the first priority.\u201d\n\nSaadi said immigrants with serious physical or mental illnesses require consistent visits with doctors and need to have trusting relationships with their physicians, something they don\u2019t have access to in detention. She said speedy treatment is a necessity, since diseases like cancer can progress quickly. But during Saadi\u2019s visits to ICE detention centers in California and Texas, she\u2019s seen immigrants who weren\u2019t getting medication for chronic conditions such as diabetes, which resulted in harmful effects and could lead to complications such as heart attacks. She wrote a medical review for a man with a brain tumor who was not being treated.\n\nSaadi says detention also exacerbates an immigrant\u2019s existing trauma. The government\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that separated families resulted in lasting mental health issues, such as kids being depressed and self-harming. The Trump administration is now seeking to replace the current 20-day limit on family detention outlined in a decades-old court agreement so that children and their parents can be kept together in detention centers indefinitely.\n\nBut doctors told HuffPost that even when families are detained as a unit, they can experience toxic stress, which can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal thoughts and long-term physical issues, such as high blood pressure and heart disease.\n\nIn Karnes, the women speak to psychologists over the phone rather than in person, according to their declarations. \u201cI still feel sad and cry every day. I still have attacks,\u201d said a woman who fled Sierra Leone. She said there are times when she cannot sleep or talk and she sobs uncontrollably.\n\nICE officers can release asylum seekers who pose no risk to the community on parole or on bond while they are waiting for their immigration dates. But the Trump administration\u2019s strategy has been to detain people for as long as possible, despite the cost and the evidence that those who are released still show up to immigration court, according to Michelle Bran\u00e9, the director of the migrant rights and justice program at the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission.\n\nOver the next few days, RAICES expects ICE to transfer all of the more than 1,000 women who were being held at Karnes to other facilities to make way for incoming families. But RAICES wants the government to stop detaining women with illnesses, since they will likely struggle with the same subpar medical treatment in other facilities.\n\nThe organization, along with three members of Congress, have also called for Karnes to be shut down so that families won\u2019t be subjected to the same medical and psychological problems that now exist there.\n\n\u201cWe know prolonged detention, especially for people who are fleeing trauma and violence, leads to depression,\u201d said Meza. \u201cThe idea of putting families and children into this situation is horrifying.\u201d", "description": "One woman has been denied cancer treatment for more than two months.
