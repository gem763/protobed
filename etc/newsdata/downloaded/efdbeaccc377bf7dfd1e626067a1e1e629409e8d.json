There is really not any time to lose,\" Anja, a 25-year-old psychology student, told Reuters news agency.\n\n'Setback'\n\nThe SVP, which won a record number of seats in 2015 amid Europe's refugee crisis, slipped 3.6 points to 25.8 percent while the Greens' share surged 5.9 points to 13.0 percent of the vote for the lower house, according to a projection by gfs.bern, a research institute that closely monitors Switzerland's elections and referendums.\n\nUniversity of Lausanne political scientist Oscar Mazzoleni told AFP news agency the results showed that the SVP struggled to attract young voters while its ageing electoral base was less motivated to vote than in 2015, when Europe's migrant crisis was on \"page one\".\n\nThe SVP is also the only major party that has not pledged to pursue bolder climate action, having consistently denounced \"climate hysteria\" in Swiss politics.\n\n\n\n\"We knew we were going to suffer a setback,\" outgoing SVP senator Oscar Freysinger told local media.\n\n\n\n\"But the important point remains that before saving the planet we have to save Swiss sovereignty,\" he added.\n\n\n\nAside from warning about the threats of immigration, the SVP has also built its brand by condemning the influence of the European Union in non-EU member Switzerland.\n\n'Magic formula'\n\nUnder Switzerland's unique political system, the election decides the 200 lower house lawmakers and 46 senators elected to four-year terms. But the make-up of the executive Federal Council will not be decided until December.\n\n\n\nUnder the so-called \"magic formula\" for power sharing, six cabinet seats are shared equally by the SVP, the Socialist Party and the right-leaning Free Democratic Party (PLR), with the centrist Christian Democrats holding the seventh seat.\n\n\n\nThe presidency rotates each year.\n\nThe Greens finished fourth, narrowly beating the Christian Democrats, but it remains unclear when they will join the cabinet.\n\nSunday's results provided further evidence that a nation whose economy and lifestyle are closely tied to the country's stunning snow-capped peaks has grown increasingly concerned about the ravages of climate change.\n\n\n\nA recent study by Zurich's ETH university found that more than 90 percent of 4,000 glaciers dotted throughout the Alps could disappear by the year 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed.", "description": "Far-right Swiss People's Party remained in the lead but lost ground on environmental concerns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/21/a7cb2e06931e41e78306893ba48b8297_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
