I watched my dad, my hero die.\n\n\"The pain is unreal. I close my eyes and relive the nightmare over and over again. I don\u2019t ever want to close my eyes again.\"\n\nShe said: \"At around 12am, my father had still not received any pain relief. So I went to the nurses' station, and spoke to several nurses again and a doctor and stressed to them that my father was deteriorating and needed to be seen.\n\n\"At approximately 12.30am, my father started to vomit, so I sat him up and fluid was pouring out of his mouth. This fluid was not sick or bile. It was orange water like liquid, the same that had been drained from his stomach on a previous occasion last year.\n\n(Image: Emma Driver)\n\n\"I was shouting for help, nurses and members of the public just looked on. My father then slid off the trolley he was on and I was struggling to manage him.\"\n\nMs Driver said her father went pale and his eyes rolled back and were glazed.\n\nShe added: \"Only when he was on the floor, two nurses came to help and reluctantly helped me get him on the trolley.\n\n\"My father was then rushed to resus (the resuscitation area), where I was told I was not allowed in but I persisted. After a few minutes I told the team trying to resuscitate my father to stop. Electrodes were offered but I declined.\n\n(Image: Emma Driver)\n\n\"At 12.59am my father was pronounced dead. I feel let down, as my father was bought in as an emergency patient, I didn\u2019t bring him in on a whim.\n\n\"He was bought in by an ambulance because something serious was wrong. I believe had my father been prioritised, or I had been listened to and taken seriously then my father would still be here.\n\n\"As he had been through this before, and prior to the events that happened Sunday, he was not a dying man.\"\n\nThe traumatic events took place on the evening of October 13, and the early hours of October 14.\n\nThat weekend, the hospital has previously revealed it experienced two abnormally busy periods - during which time ambulance arrival levels were said to be double the volume of what would already be considered a surge.\n\nIt is not known if Mr Driver arrived during one of the busy periods.\n\n(Image: SWNS.com)\n\nA spokesman for University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire is investigating the matter.\n\nThey said: \u201cThe Trust would like to offer its sincere and heartfelt sympathies to Mr Driver\u2019s family and friends at this sad and difficult time.\n\n\"We are in contact with the family and are investigating this matter thoroughly.\u201d\n\nMs Driver told CoventryLive she arrived at the hospital with her father by ambulance at 6.30pm, but paramedics were unable to hand over their patient to hospital staff until around 8pm.\n\nOnce inside, she claimed he was placed on a trolley and made to wait in the corridor.\n\nThree hours later, she says that she was told he was 8th on a list to be seen - despite her father's condition seemingly deteriorating.", "description": "Donald Driver's daughter said her father 'was not a dying man' and slammed NHS bosses for his death at University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire", "authors": ["Elis Sandford", "Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Emma Driver", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20711238.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Donald-Driver.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
