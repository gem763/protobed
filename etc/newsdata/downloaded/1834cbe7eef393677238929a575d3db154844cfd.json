Per a Daily Mail article from September 23, an \u201cunsuspecting Christian couple\u201d in Indiana, Michael and Kristine Barnett, had adopted \u201can adorable little girl only to discover she is an adult sociopath masquerading as a child.\u201d\n\nBut things very quickly got complicated: Was Natalia Grace, the couple\u2019s adopted daughter, really a 22-year-old pretending to be a child and terrorizing her parents, as Kristine has claimed? Or did the parents abandon Natalia, who was actually a minor, and flee to Canada? What is going on here?\n\nThe short answer is that we still don\u2019t really know. On Friday, September 27, both Barnetts pleaded not guilty to two counts of felony neglect of a dependent in an Indiana courthouse; though Kristine declined to speak to reporters afterward, a lawyer representing her told NBC she was looking forward to \u201ctelling her story in court.\u201d And earlier this week, it was reported that Natalia had been found living with another family. Here\u2019s what can be parsed from this utterly strange and confusing tale so far:\n\nWho are the Barnetts, and what have they been charged with?\n\nKristine Barnett, 45, and her ex-husband Michael Barnett, 43, are the couple who adopted Natalia in May 2010 from a Florida adoption center and took her to their home in Indiana. In 2013, they abandoned her in the U.S. and moved to Canada, though Kristine insists she did so after discovering that Natalia was lying about being a child. (Before making headlines for this case, Kristine was best known as an author and motivational speaker whose expertise was raising children with special needs.)\n\nEarlier this month, the Tippecanoe County Sheriff\u2019s Department charged the Barnetts with two counts of felony abandonment of a dependent based on a 2014 statement Natalia made to police: that she had been \u201cleft alone\u201d by her adoptive parents in 2013. She reportedly told police she was originally from the Ukraine and had been brought to the U.S. in 2008 via an adoption program. According to court documents, Natalia has a form of dwarfism and stands at about three feet tall, and needs help walking.\n\nKristine and Michael\u2019s trial is set to take place on January 28, 2020.\n\nSo how old is Natalia, really?\n\nIt\u2019s unclear. According to the Lafayette Journal and Courier, she\u2019s now \u201ceither 30 or 16, depending on the documents used to age her.\u201d The confusion stems from the fact that the Barnetts had Natalia\u2019s birth certificate \u201ccorrected\u201d in 2012, after a judge agreed to their petition to have her birth date updated to 1989. The Barnetts claim that a family doctor who conducted bone-density tests after Natalia was adopted determined she was 14 years old or older, and a 2016 letter from Michael Barnett\u2019s primary-care doctor insists that she \u201cis substantially older than she claims to be,\u201d citing her dental records and \u201csecondary sex characteristics\u201d as proof.\n\nBut officials have called these claims into question. Police say that bone-density tests carried out on Natalia in 2010 show that Natalia was eight years old then, and that in 2012, tests showed she was around 11. A lawyer who represented Natalia in 2013 told the Journal and Courier, \u201cI do not believe her to be an adult at the time I represented her.\u201d Another lawyer, who represented a family who tried to obtain guardianship of Natalia, told the outlet, \u201cThe most egregious part of it is that this child was turned into an adult without any representation \u2026 This kid\u2019s sitting out there, and her parents say, \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to turn you into an adult.\u2019 Which is what I find incredibly offensive.\u201d\n\nFrom 2013 to 2016, police say, the Barnetts did not support Natalia financially while she lived alone in an apartment in Lafayette, Indiana, and they lived in Canada, where they had moved so their other son, Jacob, could attend a specialized school. Jacob was diagnosed with autism at age 2 and has a genius-level IQ, and Kristine wrote a book about him called Spark in 2013.\n\nThe police say Michael Barnett, who now lives back in Indiana with his current wife, told them this month that \u201cKristine Barnett told Natalia to tell others Natalia looks young but was actually 22.\u201d He\u2019s now denying that he made the statement.\n\nWhat do the Barnetts say?\n\nThe Barnetts claim they are the victims of fraud. Kristine Barnett told the Daily Mail that the couple was told Natalia was 6 years old when they adopted her in 2010, but they quickly began noticing things that would indicate she was not a child: She says that she discovered Natalia had full pubic hair while giving her a bath; she also says the girl \u201cshunned dolls and toys,\u201d and had a sophisticated vocabulary. At one point, Barnett claims, she started finding evidence that Natalia was getting her period and hiding it.\n\nKristine Barnett says Natalia\u2019s behavior became dangerous after her family doctor performed the bone-density test on her, which Barnett says showed she was \u201c14 years old or older\u201d (prompting comparisons between the case and 2009\u2019s Orphan). She alleges that Natalia drew pictures saying \u201cshe wanted to kill family members, roll them up in a blanket and put them in the backyard\u201d; that she put bleach or Windex in Barnett\u2019s coffee and told her, \u201cI am trying to poison you\u201d; that she stood over the Barnetts while they slept; that she allegedly attacked a younger child; and that she tried to drag Barnett into an electric fence in 2012. Natalia was then placed in a psychiatric unit at a hospital. During treatment, a therapist says she allegedly revealed she was 18, and the Barnett\u2019s family doctor wrote a letter saying that he supported the idea that Natalia \u201chad made a career out of pretending to be a young child.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, the Barnetts officially had Natalia\u2019s age \u201ccorrected\u201d to 22 in county court \u2014 in order to get her the psychiatric treatment she needed as an adult, they say. According to Kristine Barnett, Natalia dropped out of contact after she helped her rent an apartment, and she worried she had been posing as a child for another family. \u201cI had found a little pink dress in her closet and a little pink bicycle parked beside her house,\u201d Barnett said.\n\nWhere is Natalia?!\n\nPolice haven\u2019t released any official update on Natalia\u2019s whereabouts, but according to the Daily Mail, Natalia is now living with another Indiana couple, Antwon and Cynthia Mans, and their five children. They are the same couple who applied to be Natalia\u2019s guardians in 2016, filing documents that referred to Natalia as \u201capproximately 13 or 14 years of age, born September 4 (year uncertain) \u2026 who is unable to maintain and care for her financial affairs and person as she is actually a minor abandoned by her adoptive parents.\u201d The Manses reportedly asked for a judge to reinstate Natalia\u2019s original birth date and overturn the ruling that said she was born in 1989, but it was upheld, and they withdrew their petition.\n\nThe Manses are also said to be a religious Christian couple, and Antwon Mans was recently ordained as a pastor. They refused to give a comment to the Daily Mail, but a \u201cfriend\u201d is quoted as saying that Natalia is in \u201ca really awkward position\u201d because of the sensational claims that she is an adult rather than a teenager.\n\nWe still don\u2019t really know why police are just filing charges now, or how exactly Natalia was able to take care of herself despite living alone after the Barnetts moved to Canada. The Manses allegedly met Natalia at some point in 2013.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional information.", "description": "Did a couple in Indiana adopt a 22-year-old Ukrainian woman named Natalia masquerading as a child?
