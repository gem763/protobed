Treasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought. There is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done. Stay tuned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement comes as Turkey continues a military offensive against Kurdish militia groups in northern Syria, whom it considers terrorists. The offensive was launched following Trump\u2019s withdrawal of US forces from the area, where they had fought alongside the Kurds against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS).\n\nAccused of \u201cabandoning\u201d the Kurds, Trump has repeatedly stressed his desire not to get involved in another \u201cendless war\u201d in the Middle East. He has, however, faced pressure from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to punish Turkey for its anti-Kurdish operation.\n\nAlso on rt.com Crocodile tears? Hillary Clinton tweets that \u2018sickening horror\u2019 in Syria is \u2018one man\u2019s fault\u2019 and gets reminded of her deeds\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, mentioned in Trump\u2019s tweet, has long been a proponent of keeping US boots on the ground in Syria, and urged Trump on Friday to \u201cchange course\u201d and use the US military to block the Turkish offensive. Graham and Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen (Maryland) have also unveiled a sanctions bill that would personally target Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his top officials, and freeze military aid to Ankara.\n\nFor the moment, sanctions seem to be the Trump administration\u2019s favored route. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday that by deploying \u201cpowerful sanctions,\u201d the US can \u201cshut down the Turkish economy if we need to.\u201d\n\nAside from the potential targeting of civilians \u2013 which Erdogan has vowed to avoid \u2013 the US is concerned that Islamic State prisoners held in Kurdish-controlled regions may escape amid the conflict. Kurdish officials said earlier on Sunday that \u201chundreds\u201d of Islamic State-linked prisoners had already escaped from a camp hit by Turkish shelling.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
