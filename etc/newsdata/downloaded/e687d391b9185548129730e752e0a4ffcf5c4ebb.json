The study looked at hundreds of feet of rocks from from the impact crater in the Gulf of Mexico that were created within the first day that the massive asteroid struck Earth.\n\n\"It's an expanded record of events that we were able to recover from within ground zero,\u201d Gulick added. \"It tells us about impact processes from an eyewitness location.\"\n\nJackson School of Geosciences/The University of Texas at Austin\n\nResearchers said that studying the rocks from the impact zone shed new light on the longer-lasting effects of the asteroid impact that wiped out 75% of life on the planet.\n\nOne of their biggest findings was that there was no sulfur in the core of the asteroid impact zone, but the area surrounding the crater was full of sulfur-rich rocks, researchers said in a statement. The lack of sulfur at the core supports a theory that the impact alone of the asteroid instantly vaporized sulfur minerals at the site, releasing them into the atmosphere, blocking sunlight and causing a global cooling.\n\nJackson School of Geosciences/The University of Texas at Austin\n\nWhile the impact of the asteroid was massive, \"the real killer has got to be atmospheric,\" according to Gulick.\n\n\"The only way you get a global mass extinction like this is an atmospheric effect,\" he added.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/asteroid-impact-03-ht-jt-190911_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
