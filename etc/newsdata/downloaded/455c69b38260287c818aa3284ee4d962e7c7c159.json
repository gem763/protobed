(Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters)\n\nDemocrats and their media friends are attempting to paint the Barr investigation, in the public mind, as a corrupt extension of a down-and-dirty Trump 2020 political campaign.\n\nIn the weekend column, I observed the media-Democrat complex\u2019s politicized reporting of the July 25 conversation between President Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart:\n\nTrump detractors hyper-focus on the president\u2019s request that President Zelensky provide Attorney General Barr with any information Ukraine might have about Biden twisting arms to quash an investigation involving his son\u2019s cashing in on dad\u2019s influence. I say \u201chyper-focus\u201d because there was a lot more to it than that. Long before the conversation came around to the Biden topic, the \u201cfavor\u201d that Trump asked for was Zelensky\u2019s assistance in Barr\u2019s ongoing investigation of the genesis of the Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nVirtually all mainstream-media reporting and Democratic commentary on the conversation now fits this pattern. It is noted that Trump, immediately after the \u201cquid pro quo\u201d set-up \u2014 \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though\u201d \u2014 invoked the attorney general, the nation\u2019s top federal law-enforcement official. Studiously omitted is the context of this invocation: a wholly appropriate request by the president, to the head of state of a country in possession of relevant evidence, for cooperation with a legitimate investigation being conducted by our country\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nInstead, the coverage skips a few hundred words. It cuts directly to Trump\u2019s suggestion that Zelensky look into whether there was any impropriety in former vice president Biden\u2019s having purportedly \u201cstopped the prosecution\u201d that might have arisen out of a Ukrainian investigation involving his son.\n\nThe strategy here is obvious. The Democrats and their note-takers would like the public to believe that Barr\u2019s investigation is an adjunct of the Trump 2020 campaign \u2014 and a grossly improper one at that. The misimpression they seek to create is that Barr is putting the nation\u2019s law-enforcement powers in the service of Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, in the absence of any public interest. The hope is that this will delegitimize not only any information that emerges from Ukraine but the whole of the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of intelligence and law-enforcement abuses of power attendant to the 2016 election.\n\nI\u2019ll repeat what I elaborated over the weekend:\n\nNo matter how much Democrats seek to discredit that probe and the AG overseeing it, it is a legitimate investigation conducted by the United States Department of Justice, which has prosecutors assigned and grand jury subpoena power. It is examining questionable Justice Department and FBI conduct. It is considering whether irregularities rise to the level of crimes. It will be essential to Congress\u2019s consideration of whether laws need to be enacted or modified to insulate our election campaigns from politicized use of the government\u2019s counterintelligence and law-enforcement powers.\n\nThe hypocrisy here is breathtaking, even by Adam Schiff standards.\n\nMany of us did not like the Mueller investigation. I repeatedly contended that the appointment of a special counsel was inappropriate for several reasons. The pertinent regulations require a basis for believing a crime predicating a criminal investigation or prosecution has occurred, and there was none in the case of President Trump. The regs similarly require a conflict of interest based on the predicate crime, and since there was no such predicate, there was no conflict requiring the Justice Department to appoint an outside lawyer. The FBI and Justice Department had announced that they were conducting a counterintelligence investigation; unlike a criminal investigation, counterintelligence investigations are typically not assigned to a prosecutor because intelligence collection and analysis are not intended to build courtroom prosecutions. Furthermore, the president was repeatedly told he was not under investigation (a representation the FBI and Justice Department must be held to, even though it appears not to have been true). And there was no legal basis for the FBI to open a criminal investigation of the president (as then\u2013acting director Andrew McCabe said he did) just because the president fired the FBI director \u2014 which the president is constitutionally empowered to do at will, which did not obstruct the Russia investigation in the slightest, and which McCabe acknowledged did not obstruct the Russia investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the media-Democrat complex became apoplectic at any suggestion of impropriety in Mueller\u2019s appointment. On pain of ostracism, its legitimacy was never to be questioned. Case closed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaturally, Trump\u2019s opponents did not want to articulate the actual, nakedly political reason for their defense of Mueller \u2014 namely, that he was the best hope for bringing down Trump\u2019s presidency. They thus couched their defense in legal terms. The special-counsel regs make clear that the Justice Department\u2019s failure to adhere to them is not actionable. Consequently, as long as DOJ had a plausible basis to investigate some of their subjects \u2014 such as Paul Manafort, who had committed crimes unrelated to Russian \u201ccollusion,\u201d and George Papadopoulos, who hadn\u2019t \u201ccolluded\u201d but had allegedly lied to investigators \u2014 the then\u2013acting attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, undeniably had the power to bring a special counsel in from outside the Justice Department to conduct the investigation.\n\nRegardless of how blatantly politicized the Mueller probe appeared to be, then, it was an official, legitimate federal investigation \u2014 one that was commissioned by the Justice Department, which lawfully resorted to the powers of the grand jury, and the obstruction of which (or lying to which) was actionable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow the shoe is on the other foot.\n\nTrump opponents do not like Barr\u2019s investigation of the genesis and conduct of the Russia investigation. It is, nonetheless, a proper exercise of the Justice Department\u2019s lawful authority. Indeed, contrary to the Mueller investigation, there are no questions about the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s assignment. John Durham, the U.S. Attorney for Connecticut assigned by Barr, is not a special counsel brought in from outside. He is an in-house Justice Department lawyer, authorized to examine potential law violations. There is no question, moreover, that the attorney general has the authority to investigate possible malfeasance or misfeasance by the Justice Department \u2014 if nothing else, for the purpose of preventing its repetition by improving internal guidelines or even asking Congress for curative legislation.\n\nIt is a commonplace for our government to seek assistance from foreign governments in ongoing federal investigations. In fact, Washington and Kyiv entered a mutual legal assistance treaty in 1998. In approving this U.S.\u2013Ukraine \u201cMLAT\u201d in 2000, the Senate noted that the original purpose of such treaties was \u201cto permit the United States to obtain evidence from foreign jurisdictions in a form admissible in American courts.\u201d As chief executive, it is not at all unusual for a president to encourage another country\u2019s assistance in Justice Department investigations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContrary to the president\u2019s public insistence, his conversation with President Zelensky was not \u201cperfect.\u201d It was foolish to raise questions about the Bidens.\n\nAs I pointed out in the column, there may very well be a basis for the Justice Department to scrutinize Hunter Biden\u2019s cashing in on his father\u2019s political influence, under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and perhaps other federal statutes. But the president should leave it to the Justice Department to determine whether there are grounds to look into the Bidens\u2019 activities, including in the context of the Obama administration\u2019s dealings with Ukrainian authorities in the run-up to the 2016 election. At present, though, there is no reason to believe that when Trump spoke with Zelensky, there was any pending Justice Department investigation focused on Hunter Biden\u2019s business transactions with foreign interests. Viewed in isolation, the president\u2019s request for a Ukrainian inquiry that could damage a political rival appears abusive. It is not serious enough to be an impeachable offense, but it is behavior that most voters, regardless of party or ideology, are apt to find unseemly.\n\nStill, the Biden portion of the conversation did not happen in isolation. It had a context. It was a subordinate strand of a perfectly appropriate executive-branch request for assistance in a completely legitimate Justice Department investigation into government misconduct that is potentially serious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats and their media friends are attempting to bleach away that context and paint the Barr investigation, in the public mind, as a corrupt extension of a down-and-dirty Trump 2020 political campaign.
