Both sides were still talking Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not insulting,\u201d Art Wheaton, an auto industry expert at the Worker Institute at Cornell University, said of the offer. \u201cIt\u2019s not close enough to ideal, but they\u2019re still talking.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

That person said health care, a key sticking point with union members, would remain the same as it is now. The person, who also didn\u2019t want to be identified because the talks are confidential, did not know the status of other provisions that were being discussed Wednesday.\n\nAmong the union\u2019s big problems with the Monday offer is a provision requiring temporary workers to be employed for three uninterrupted years before they automatically become full-time. It\u2019s unlikely the workers would not be laid off in three years, making it almost impossible to reach full-time status, the person said. Full-time workers on the picket lines say they want to see temporary workers get permanent jobs.\n\nFor workers who were hired before 2007, the Monday night offer includes 2% raises in 2020 and 2022, as well as a 2% lump sum payment in 2019 and 3% in 2021. Workers also would get an $8,000 ratification bonus, and a cap would be lifted on profit-sharing.\n\nFull-time workers hired after 2007, who now are paid less than older workers, would get the same profit-sharing and ratification bonuses. But they wouldn\u2019t get pay raises other than the steps on the pay scale negotiated in the last contract, the first person said of the Monday night offer. Those who have reached the maximum pay rate of $28 per hour would get a 2% lump sum payment in 2019 and 3% in 2021. But the union wants new hires to eventually make as much as older production workers who are paid $30 per hour.\n\nAlthough the company promised uncapped profit-sharing, the Monday night offer proposed shifting money from annual quality bonuses and other payouts to fund any increase, the first person said.\n\nGM also kept its offer to build an electric pickup truck at a plant in Detroit that it had planned to close, and to build an electric vehicle battery factory run by a joint venture somewhere in the area of Lordstown, Ohio, where GM also wants to close a factory, the person said.\n\nCornell\u2019s Wheaton said both sides are haggling over labor costs that amount to less than 5% of the sticker price of a car, so he said he sees room for both sides to bargain. Bargainers for both sides know they have to come up with a deal that will be ratified by members who will want a payoff for going on strike, Wheaton said.\n\nOn the picket lines, members have said repeatedly that they want a bigger share of the more than $30 billion in profits that GM has made during the past five years. But GM wants to cut its labor costs so they are closer to those at U.S. factories run by foreign automakers, mainly in the South.\n\nWorkers earn $250 per week in strike pay while they\u2019re on the picket lines, about one-fifth of what they normally make. But industry analysts say GM is losing more than $80 million a day as the strike continues. The union had $750 million in its strike fund when the work stoppage began Sept. 16, but GM has billions in cash on its balance sheet.\n\n\u201cNeither side has to give in. Both sides could string it out longer, but it becomes, \u2018At what point is it worth it?\u2019\u201d Wheaton asked.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Bargainers for the United Auto Workers union made a counter offer that is now the subject of negotiations, AP's source says.", "authors": ["Tom Krisher"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ap19274481957691.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
