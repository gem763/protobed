Orgeron also said LSU was prepared and brought a fleet of fans in after being tipped off by Louisiana Tech, Texas\u2019 Week 1 opponent.\n\n#LSU Coach O seems to confirm there was no air conditioning in the Tigers' locker room at Texas, something Louisiana Tech warned them about. pic.twitter.com/Llm3lG4csJ \u2014 Jacques Doucet (@JacquesDoucet) September 9, 2019\n\nLater Monday, Texas athletic director Chris Del Conte released a statement contradicting Orgeron\u2019s comments. Del Conte said that the air conditioning in the visiting locker room is \u201cin good working order.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe comment today about lack of air conditioning in our visiting locker room is the first we\u2019ve heard of any issues in that area,\u201d Del Conte said. \u201cWe provide one of the best visitor setups available and are proud of the efforts we put forth in hosting our guests. Our facilities staff did not receive any complaints from either Louisiana Tech or LSU, and we\u2019ve confirmed that our air conditioning in the visiting locker room is in good working order.\u201d\n\nTexas officials were \u201cangered\u201d by Orgeron\u2019s comments, according to the Austin American-Statesman.\n\nLSU dealt with cramping during game\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was a hot, hot night in Texas on Saturday. The official game notes listed the game time temperature as 98 degrees. Throughout the game, several LSU players were slowed by cramps \u2014 much to the chagrin of the skeptical UT fans who believed the LSU players were trying to slow down the Longhorns\u2019 tempo by faking injuries.\n\nOrgeron said Monday he attributed the cramping more to the fact that his defense was out on the field for 93 plays.\n\n\"We did some things in the dressing room that were better. It wasn't great, but it was better,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cAt least we had air in there. They didn't have air. We had some blowers in there. I don't think that caused as much as going out there and having to play 93 plays on defense. I think that had a lot to do with it.\"\n\nLSU moved up to No. 4 in the AP poll after beating Texas in Austin on Saturday night. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate via AP)\n\nLSU is used to warm temperatures \u2014 and Texas is nowhere near as humid as Baton Rouge. To combat issues with cramping in the future, Orgeron said the team has already talked about having more IV treatments available for the players at halftime.\n\n\u201cI think the humidity was like 23 percent. It wasn't like Louisiana, but our guys did cramp up in the second half,\u201d Orgeron said. \u201cWe talked about it as a staff that we need to get some more IVs at halftime. Didn't seem like nobody needed one at that time, but to prevent that I think that more guys will get IVs at halftime, obviously with the doctor's approval.\"\n\nI\u2019m sure this won\u2019t be the last we hear about this, especially with Texas visiting Baton Rouge for the second half of the home-and-home series next year.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "What would college football be without a little controversy?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Dv3IqMLwUqaQowuwfJaXUA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD0xMTU1LjI-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x9n7qYi_6LdUDefisnGXvQ--~B/aD0zMTgwO3c9MzUyNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/75d94af0-d267-11e9-b5fe-71930777136d", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
