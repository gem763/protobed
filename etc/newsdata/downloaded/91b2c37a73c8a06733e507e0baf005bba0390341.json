Jordan Binnington stopped 32 shots.\n\nFrederik Gauthier and William Nylander scored for Toronto, which has dropped two straight (2-1-1). Frederik Andersen finished with 26 saves.\n\nThe Blues scored the decisive goal at 7:51 of the third when David Perron found a pinching Pietrangelo, who beat a down-and-out Andersen from a tight angle at the bottom of the faceoff circle for his second of the season. Pietrangelo also earned his 400th career point and 23rd game-winner to break a tie with Al MacInnis for the most by a defenseman in franchise history.\n\nSt. Louis had a chance to add to its lead when Toronto defenseman Jake Muzzin went off for slashing with 4:57 left, but the a(;e Leafs had the best chance when Binnington robbed Ilya Mikheyev with his right pad off the rush.\n\nToronto pressed with Andersen on the bench for the extra skater, but couldn\u2019t find a way past Binnington and the Blues\u2018 stout, battle-tested defense.\n\nThe Blues opened the scoring at 8:30 of the second when Sundqvist - the Blues\u2018 fourth-line center - moved in on Andersen and fired a slap shot from the top of the faceoff circle.\n\nThe Maple Leafs tied it when Jason Spezza batted a puck out of the air to Gauthier, who banged in his second of the season with 8:26 left.\n\nFans at Scotiabank barely had a chance to sit back down when they were on their feet again 24 seconds later when Nylander finished off a beautiful passing play with Cody Ceci and Andreas Johnsson for his second.\n\nSt. Louis, which went from last in the overall standings in January to winning the franchise\u2019s first Stanley Cup in June, pushed back late in the period and tied it with 47.3 seconds left on the clock when Schenn beat Andersen between the pads after Toronto defenseman Morgan Rielly turned the puck over.\n\nBinningtong was helped out by two posts in a busy first period.\n\nToronto center Alexander Kerfoot hit the post just two minutes in after moving in alone on Binnington. Andersen snapped his glove out at the other end to deny Schenn after the Maple Leafs were caught running around in the defensive zone for an extended period.\n\nAuston Matthews, who had five goals in three games to open the season, then rang another shot off the post behind Binnington on a Toronto power play before Nylander couldn\u2019t quite control a loose puck with the St. Louis goalie down and out.\n\nNOTES: Last season, Nylander didn\u2019t get his second goal until his 24th game following a long contract impasse that dragged into December. \u2026 Spezza was a healthy scratch for two of Toronto\u2019s first three games. He suited up at home for the first time and registered his first point with the Maple Leafs after signing for the league minimum in free agency on July 1. .. Binnington, a native of nearby Richmond Hill, Ontario, made his first-ever start at Scotiabank Arena after not grabbing the No. 1 job in St. Louis until early January last season. The 26-year-old did beat Toronto 3-2 in overtime at Enterprise Center on Feb. 19.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBlues: At Ottawa on Thursday night.\n\nMaple Leafs: Host Tampa Bay on Thursday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Alex Pietrangelo scored the tiebreaking goal in the third period, leading the St. Louis Blues to a 3-2 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Monday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/blues_maple_leafs_hockey_22702_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
