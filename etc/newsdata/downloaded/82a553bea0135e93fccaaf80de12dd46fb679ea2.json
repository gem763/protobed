Officials explained that the complex requirements of the original rules can have a chilling effect on hospitals and doctors working together.\n\nA major focus is to try to improve follow-up care for patients after they are discharged from hospitals, an area in which Medicare is increasingly holding hospitals accountable.\n\nWednesday\u2019s announcement starts a rule-making process expected to take months. The revised regulations run to an estimated 800 pages and will be pored over by lawyers for the health care industry, which has billions of dollars at stake. Patient advocates are keenly interested that consumer protections are not weakened.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the goal is to make the health care system more efficient, not to open the door to new types of fraud.\n\n\u201cWe propose these changes with great appreciation for the intent of these statutes, which is preventing patients from being taken advantage of and taxpayer dollars from being misspent,\u201d Azar said.\n\nOfficials said patients will ultimately benefit, because it should be easier to help them avoid foreseeable problems after hospitalization.\n\nThe Health and Human Services inspector general\u2019s office is involved in rewriting one of the rules, which enforces an anti-kickback statute that it oversees.\n\nThe other major revision involves a rule that forbids clinicians from referring patients to facilities in which they have a financial interest. That rule is named after a law passed by former longtime Democratic Rep. Pete Stark of California.\n\nThe rules apply mainly to federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid, but their impact is felt across the health care system.\n\nAzar said the idea is to encourage hospitals, doctors and other service providers to enter into formal \u201cvalue-based arrangements,\u201d in which they collaborate to improve care for patients and commit to delivering measurable results.\n\nFor example, a hospital may send a kidney patient home with technology to monitor critical health indicators and automatically transmit back any signs of problems. Under existing rules, such an arrangement could be interpreted as the hospital providing the patient an illegal \u201cinducement\u201d to continue using its services.\n\nOfficials said the proposed revisions will:\n\n- create new exceptions to the self-referral and anti-kickback rules for value-based arrangements\n\n- update existing exceptions\n\n- generally clarify the rules themselves.\n\nOne new exception involves cyber-security technology, Medicare Administrator Seema Verma said. The goal is to allow hospitals to share cyber-security technology with medical practices that they deal with, improving protections across the health care system.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much money the revised rules are expected to save the health care system. Officials said it depends on the degree to which hospitals and other service providers voluntarily enter into the new, protected arrangements.\n\nThe original rules date to when Medicare paid piecemeal for each service delivered. The program has been shifting to paying an overall amount for major types of procedures, which is tied to quality results.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Trump administration on Wednesday proposed overhauling decades-old Medicare rules originally meant to deter fraud and abuse but now seen as a roadblock to coordinating better care for patients.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/medicare_rules_90578_c0-215-5142-3213_s1770x1032.jpg?0520b954ea5f8ce8a63befea2a83c9131e2d615a", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
