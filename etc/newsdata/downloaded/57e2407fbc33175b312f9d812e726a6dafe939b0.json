Typically, the pool of assets is a small group of loans or debt obligations that cannot be sold to individual investors. Packaging these assets as a single financial instrument allows them to be sold to investors. Since the underlying assets are diversified, there is less risk exposure for those who invest. Read on to learn more about ABS and if they are a suitable investment for your asset mix.\n\nAsset-Backed Securities Explained\n\nSimilar to mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities are securities backed by a pool of assets that, in turn, create cash flow. However, this pool of assets isn\u2019t backed by mortgages. Some of the assets that back these securities include home equity loans, student loans, auto loans and credit card receivables. Typically, lenders or financial firms cannot sell these pools on their own.\n\nABS gives lenders more ways to obtain a cash flow while offering investors the opportunity to invest in a diversified asset mix that produces income. Some investors may use ABS as an alternative to investing in corporate debt.\n\nHow Asset-Backed Securities Work\n\nHere's everything you need to know about asset-backed securities. More\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say Company ABC lends borrowers home equity loans. If a borrower would like to take out a home equity loan, a lender will give that borrower cash in exchange for repayment terms and conditions which include interest payments. If Company ABC is making a lot of money on home equity loans, they may have the ability to lend to more borrowers if the current loans were packaged together.\n\nTherefore, they could decide to bundle the home equity loans and sell them to an investment institution and use the proceeds to lend to even more borrowers. Once the transaction is complete, the financial institution will place these securities into a variety of groups or otherwise known as tranches. Each tranche has a collection of assets or loans with similar characteristics like maturity, interest rates or delinquency rates.\n\nOnce the investment institution has grouped the loans in to a tranche, they will issue asset-backed securities. You could compare these securities to a typical bond based on the tranche it creates.\n\nHow to Invest in Asset-Backed Securities\n\nInvestment firms usually divide ABS into three different tranches: class A, class B and class C. Typically, tranche A has the largest pool of loans as well as a rating that investors may prefer. Tranche B offers a lower credit quality and therefore has a higher yield than tranche A. Essentially, the investor is taking on more risk which may yield a greater return.\n\nLastly, tranche C has the lowest credit quality, which often cannot be sold to investors and must absorb the losses from the other tranches. Understanding what each tranche offers will help you select the most suitable ABS for your portfolio.\n\nIf you decide you want to invest in an ABS, you can purchase one at almost any brokerage firm. If you work with a financial advisor, they can assist you in selecting the most suitable ABS for your portfolio and cash flow needs.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nHere's everything you need to know about asset-backed securities. More\n\nMany investors think of ABS as attractive investment selections since they\u2019re known as secure investments. Similar to other securities, they are assigned a rating based on their ability to receive timely payments of the interest and principal amount. Since collateral and protections back these securities, it\u2019s more likely that debt obligations are fulfilled. From a credit standpoint, ABS are one of the most stable investment selections.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Asset-backed securities, or ABS, are securities backed by a pool of fundamental assets.
