Williams was not at her best, either, getting tight at key moments, including double-faulting on the last point of three games to get broken.\n\nThe 19-year-old Andreescu is the first woman to win the US Open in her tournament debut in the Open era, which began in 1968.", "description": "Andreescu's victory Saturday prevented Williams from claiming what would have been her record-tying 24th major singles championship.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7429852e22af450f6703e2-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
