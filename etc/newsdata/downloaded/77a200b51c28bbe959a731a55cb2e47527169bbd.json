BTC could soon test the bearish target of $7,500 as discussed in one of the recent analyses.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nAfter a short term correction, bitcoin struggled to break the $8,750 resistance area against the US Dollar. As a result, the price started consolidating losses below $8,500 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Finally, there was a downside break below the $8,350 and $8,200 support levels. It seems like the bulls failed to protect losses below the $8,200 support level.\n\nMoreover, there was a bearish break below a contracting triangle with support near $8,350 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair even broke the key $8,000 support and traded to a new monthly low at $7,736. Recently, there was an upside correction above the $7,850 level. The price traded above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,646 high to $7,736 low.\n\nHowever, the upward move is facing resistance near the $8,200 level (the previous support). Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,646 high to $7,736 low is capping upsides. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $8,040 on the same chart. Therefore, an upside break above $8,050 and $8,200 is needed for a decent recovery.\n\nIf the price fails to correct above $8,200, it could continue to move down. An immediate support is near the $7,800 level. Any further losses is likely to open the doors for a sharp decline towards the $7,500 support area in the near term. If the bulls fail to protect $7,500, the price could tumble towards the $7,000 support.\n\nLooking at the chart, bitcoin is clearly under pressure below $8,200 and $8,350. Therefore, there are high possibilities of more downsides towards $7,500 or even $7,200. Once the current decline is over, the price might correct above $8,500 in the coming days.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is slowly moving in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is currently well below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $7,800 followed by $7,500.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $8,200, $8,350 and $8,500.", "description": "Bitcoin price is extending its decline below $8,000 against the US Dollar.
