But I want to throw in a criticism I\u2019ve been mulling.\n\nFor a long time there were rumors that the final episodes of Game of Thrones would be extra long, perhaps even \u201cmovie-length.\u201d After watching last night\u2019s episode, I think that would have been better. The pacing of both episodes has been off. In the first, the reunions were almost all way too short. The conversation between Arya and the Hound should have been allowed to breathe, instead it butted-up against the reunion with Gendry which also seemed stunted. All of the interactions we\u2019ve been waiting for were clipped. Sanda and Dany should have done a couple rounds. The romantic stuff between Jon Snow and Dany was visually cool (Dragons!), but felt like box-checking. Gotta show they\u2019re still a couple!\n\nThere are exceptions. For example, the interaction in episode one between Dany and Sam, as David has written, was really well done. And I did think the teaser shot of Jamie seeing Bran at the end of episode one was great and their conversation last night was just right.\n\nBut in last night\u2019s episode we had a bit of the reverse problem. I take David\u2019s point about crafting the \u201cdeep breath before the plunge\u201d but at times it felt like padding. And some of it came at the expense of some scenes that should have been drawn out. I, for one, would have loved to hear a lot more of Tyrion\u2019s conversation with Bran. I\u2019m of mixed minds about how they handled the most important conversation so far, between Jon and Dany about his real identity. This, after all, is the heart of the coming intrigue. Cutting it short for understandable reasons, while teasing her fearful contemplation of losing her claim to the throne might have been the right call.\n\nBut there was another problem with last night\u2019s installment. Because viewers have been trained to look for cues and clues who is next to die, much of the episode seemed like an effort for people to get their \u201cWho\u2019s about to buy the farm?\u201d bingo cards filled out. It\u2019s like that scene in Hardhome when the wilding mom tells her daughters she\u2019ll be joining them soon on another boat \u2014 you knew she was about to become an ice zombie. The stuff with Grey Worm last night seemed like a textbook example of the how the gods \u2014 old, new, many-faced, and fire \u2014 laugh when man plans. The Knighting of Brienne, combined with her battle assignment, was indeed poignant. But it also felt like she was getting her metaphorical gold watch before her retirement as a character. I\u2019m particularly worried that all of the talk about the crypt being the safest place is a huge setup for some close-quarter tragic carnage.\n\nI think if they had combined these two episodes into a single 90-minute-plus movie, they would have worked out a lot of these issues better, leaving episode two for the Mother of all Battles and the Final Four for the more interesting stuff. Of course, I could be wrong. We won\u2019t know until we see the whole thing play out. But that\u2019s how I felt as they unfolded.", "description": "Viewers spent most of the episode trying to figure out who is going to be killed next.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
