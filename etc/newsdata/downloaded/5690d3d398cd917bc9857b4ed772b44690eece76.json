The case raises questions about airplane security and the background of those working on flights.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAlani\u2019s not guilty plea in Miami follows a charge that the 60-year-old mechanic had sabotaged the navigation system of a flight from Miami to Nassau, Bahamas. Sympathies with ISIS as well as claims that his brother was part of the terrorist organization raised enough concerns that he was denied bond earlier this week.\n\nAlani spent more than three decades with the airline during which time he had no issues.\n\nA spokesman for American Airlines told FOX Business that Alani would have been subject to recurrent background checks, in addition to the check he would have gone through when hired in 1988.\n\nSome experts don\u2019t think enough is being done to adequately screen those working in the airline industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe issue \u2026 isn\u2019t new, nor is it rocket science. There are numerous loopholes that penetrate airport security that our government continuously puts a blind eye towards,\u201d Doug Moss, an aviation safety expert, told FOX Business. \u201cThere are many workgroups that have direct access to airplanes who are not adequately screened. Mechanics, caterers, cleaners, fuelers and a host of other workgroups have paltry screening protocols. The [American Airlines] incident in Miami was bound to happen.\u201d\n\nIn this particular case, there are plenty of questions and very few answers yet, says Keith Mackey, a former airline captain who is now an aviation safety expert.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t being discussed, according to Mackey, is what Alani was doing in the first place and why it didn\u2019t arouse suspicion. Noting that a mechanic would be expected to be in the part of the plane where the navigation system is housed, Mackey said that the timing is suspicious and should have triggered concerns long before Alani got access to the plane.\n\n\u201cThe thing that is a mystery is that there was no write-ups when the airplane came in so there was nothing to be corrected in that area,\u201d Mackey said.\n\n\u201cSo he took it upon himself to select that airplane \u2026 He could have done something more serious. We didn\u2019t discover that he had the terrorist connection till well after the fact so that\u2019s a mystery also.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Alani\u2019s attorney, Jonathan Meltz, spoke to the media and noted that there is a single charge currently against his client. He said that he welcomed the continued investigation as it would exonerate his client.\n\nMeltz also reiterated to the press that there have been charges levied against his client involving terrorism.\n\nIf convicted on the federal charge that currently stands against him, Alani could serve a maximum sentence of 20 years.", "description": "American Airline mechanic Abdul-Majeed Marouf Ahmed Alani pled not guilty on Friday to a sabotage charge.
