But how will skill be measured?", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nFortnite's Season 11 will introduce artificial intelligence bots to help players improve in skill. (Epic Games)\n\nFortnite is introducing what\u2019s probably going to be a highly controversial addition to its player-vs.-player battle royale mode: bots.\n\nThese artificial intelligence bots will \u201cbehave similarly to normal players and will help provide a better path for players to grow in skill,\u201d said Fortnite creator Epic Games in a matchmaking update Monday. \u201cBots will work in conjunction with the new matchmaking system, and as your skill improves, you\u2019ll face fewer bots.\u201d\n\nThese fake players will not be in the competitive game modes, just throughout the general and popular battle royale modes like solo, duos and squads. Epic\u2019s \u201cnew matchmaking system\u201d means players will be more likely to be in games with players of similar skill. The v10.40 update will be slowly rolled out through different regions across the core battle royale modes.\n\nPlayers everywhere will be looking to Epic to release more details on how \u201cskill\u201d in Fortnite will be measured, particularly for players who don\u2019t want to be included in AI-filled games.\n\nThe desire for fairer Fortnite matches has always been there. Despite being the world\u2019s most popular game, Fortnite is a notoriously difficult game to play. Quick trigger fingers will only get you so far. The best players must improvise architecture and skillfully navigate it under a hail of gunfire.\n\nLast year a data-loving Reddit user created a comprehensive spreadsheet of their Fortnite sessions to see if skill-based matchmaking is at all a factor in the game (it was not).\n\nIn June 2018, Epic released a Playground game mode for players to not only build to their heart\u2019s content, but also serve as a training ground for new or novice players.\n\nIt\u2019s been a tricky balance for Epic to cater to casual players of the game (which now resembles more of a social media platform a la Instagram) and higher skill levels as Fortnite transitioned into a full-fledged esport.\n\n[Who is Kyle Giersdorf, the 16-year-old who won $3 million in the Fortnite World Cup?]\n\nThe flash reactions from the Fortnite Battle Royale subreddit is currently all over the place, with some aghast that they would play against AI, and others saying that it\u2019s a \u201cgreat addition.\u201d Moreover, AI bots wouldn\u2019t affect players who are skilled. It all comes down to how that\u2019s tracked, and how transparent Epic would be about that process.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nLouis Vuitton is now designing League of Legends skins\n\nEvery Zelda game, ranked\n\nA Madden tournament shooting survivor tried to move on.
