The manner in which you attacked this memorial was a senseless expression of the word \"mother\".\n\n'For some reason, on this protest you involved yourself in hooliganism and vandalism. It was senseless.\n\n'I fail to see how defacing a significant monument which recognises the role of women in our society, for too many decades overlooked, in overcoming the tyranny of Nazism, how defacing this memorial can in any way further the cause of those who seek to bring to our attention concerns about climate change.'\n\nPictured: The vandalism inflicted on the monument during the protests by Extinction Rebellion's Joseph O'Malley\n\nThe monument (pictured) in Whitehall, central London, commemorates the efforts of women\n\nThe judge ordered O'Malley, of Ruislip, west London, to pay a \u00a3500 fine, a \u00a350 victim surcharge, and \u00a3200 costs - a total of \u00a3750.\n\nHe said: 'There's no reason I'm told you could not get employment. You're going to need to find some work to pay this off.'\n\nThe monument was unveiled by the Queen in 2005, 60 years on from the end of the conflict which scarred Europe.\n\nDesigned by John Mills, it depicts the hung-up uniforms and working clothes of female munitions workers and servicewomen.\n\nDefending, Chantel Gaber said: 'His intention wasn't to damage that memorial. It wasn't intended to cause offence.\n\n'It was impulsive during the march. There was no long-term damage. The damage was temporary and minimal.'\n\nMs Gaber said O'Malley was jobless and carried out volunteer work, including tree-planting for a group called Fellowship of the Trees.\n\nIt was not possible to get a precise figure for the cost of removing the spray paint from the memorial, which remained on the sculpture for around two months, the court heard.", "description": "Volunteer tree-planter Joseph O'Malley wrote the word 'mother' on the 23ft tall bronze sculpture in Whitehall, central London, during protests last November.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/15/20039366-0-image-a-68_1571754330444.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
