Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) of being a \"Russian asset\" who eventually plans to run third party as a means of disrupting the 2020 presidential election. Clinton made the claim during a Friday podcast interview.\n\nWhen Gabbard heard the interview, she took to Twitter to respond, saying Clinton is \"the queen of warmongers\" and the \"embodiment of corruption.\" Gabbard also explained that the former Secretary of State has it out for her because her foreign policy is the opposite of Clinton's.\n\nOn Saturday, the 2020 candidate decided to clear the air once and for all about the rumor: she is running as a Democrat and plans to keep it that way.\n\n\"As much as Hillary Clinton would love for me to run as an independent or third party candidate, I am not entertaining that. I will not do that. I am a Democrat,\" she told The Hill.\n\n\"I'm running for the Democratic nomination in this country, to take back our Democratic Party away from this warmongering, corrupt establishment and return it to the hands of the people so that our party can truly be the party of, by, and for the people,\" Gabbard said. \"[We are] fighting every single day for peace [and] for the well being of our people, and to protect our planet.\"\n\nAs a result of the feud, Clinton backed out of Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit in Washington, D.C. Her team cited former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's slated speaking engagement as a reason for the sudden \"scheduling conflicts,\" although it's very coincidental, considering Gabbard is also speaking at the event.", "description": "Clearing the air..10/19/2019 20:05:29PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/60/9f1d352a-a24c-4438-b8c2-3ca0d5a52790.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
