The aim of many mutual funds is to provide broad-based exposure to a particular asset class; stocks, bonds, etc. With that diversity, at least in theory, should come to a lower risk profile for investors.\n\nAccording to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\u201cAll funds carry some level of risk. With mutual funds, you may lose some or all of the money you invest because the securities held by a fund can go down in value. Dividends or interest payments may also change as market conditions change\u2026A fund\u2019s past performance is not as important as you might think because past performance does not predict future returns. But past performance can tell you how volatile or stable a fund has been over a period of time.

A fundamental principle of investing known as the risk/reward tradeoff means that when you make an informed decision to assume some risk, you also create the opportunity for reward. Investors should be aware of the risks and potential for losses associated with bond mutual fund investing,\u201d according to the Investment Company Institute (ICI).\n\nHere are a few low-risk mutual funds for conservative investors to consider.\n\n\n\n\n\nFidelity Income Conservative Bond Fund (FCONX)\n\n7 Low-Risk Mutual Funds to Buy Now More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.35% per year, or $35 on a $10,000 investment.\n\nThe Fidelity Income Conservative Bond Fund (MUTF:FCONX) epitomizes \u201clow-risk mutual fund,\u201d particularly at a time when interest rates could rise.
