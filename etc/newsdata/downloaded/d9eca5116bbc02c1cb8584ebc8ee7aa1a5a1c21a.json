When all the U.S. House districts are ranked by median income, the GOP now represents 58% of the lower-income half of that spectrum, up from 39% of lower-income districts a decade ago. And it represents 34% of the higher-income half, down from 43% a decade ago.\n\nBut the shift also exacerbates the average voter\u2019s tension with the GOP\u2019s wealthier leadership class. The WSJ reported:\n\nThe most ardent Trump supporters agree with Mr. Trump\u2019s restrictive positions on immigration and his opposition to efforts to address climate change, among other policies. The party-supporting Republicans believe immigration helps the nation and that near-term action to fight climate change is needed.\n\nThe share of white GOP members with college degrees has dropped from 40 percent in 2012 down to 29 percent in 2018., while the share of non-college grads has climbed from 50 percent in 2010 to 59 percent in 2018.\n\nThe WSJ did not discuss the impact of this shift on many college graduate voters who are drifting away from the GOP because of their sympathy for left-wing civic issues, such as global warming, sexual deregulation, and pro-diversity policies.\n\nBut these college graduate voters have yet to find economic allies in the pro-migration Democratic Party.\n\nFor example, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for more immigration of \u201cstudents,\u201d which is likely a reference to young college graduates who will compete against American graduates:\n\nWe need a pathway to citizenship for the people who are here and here to stay \u2026 We need a path \u2014 not just for DREAMers \u2014 but also a path for grandmas, and for little kids, and for people who came here to work on farms, and for students who overstayed their visas. We need a path that is fair and achievable. Bring people out of the shadows. It is good for all workers, and we need to get them into our unions.\n\nSimilarly, Sen. Dick Durbin is touting legislation that would allow U.S. and Indian companies to bring in roughly 100,000 Indian white-collar workers each year.\n\nGOP Sen. Kennedy blocks Dem Sen. Durbin's bill to skyrocket transfer of US college-jobs to Indian grads. Durbin's plan is much worse than Sen. Mike Lee's @S386 for US college grads & families. Part-Kabuki, but estb. journos act like frogs in a boiling pot. https://t.co/ZktjKG04MR \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 17, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, investors are pressuring U.S. managers to replace many American graduates with cheaper foreign workers. On October 17, the San Jose Mercury News reported:\n\nThe San Francisco ride-hailing giant revealed in a California employment-department filing this month that it is laying off nearly 400 workers at its offices in the city and in Palo Alto. The filing showed software engineers at the firm were the hardest hit, with more than 125 people cut loose. Meanwhile, Uber this year received federal government approval for 299 new H-1B visas \u2014 work permits intended for jobs requiring specialized skills \u2014 compared with 152 in 2018 and 158 in 2017, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. It is unclear whether Uber plans to use all those visas or when new H-1B workers might be brought on. The visas typically cost thousands of dollars each to obtain. \u2026 \u201cWhen they\u2019re laying off, they shouldn\u2019t be using H-1Bs at all, or maybe sparingly at best,\u201d said Ron Hira, a Howard University professor who studies the use of the visa by companies. \u201cIt runs totally contrary to the intent of the H-1B program.\u201d\n\nSome of the labor markets for American college graduates are flooded with immigrants, admitted David Bier, an advocate at the Cato Institute, which favors easy immigration by foreign graduates:\n\nThe software engineer market, it\u2019s so saturated with H-1Bs that some of the people who are laid off are almost inevitably H-1Bs and some of the people that are being hired are inevitably H-1Bs.\n\nThese investors get much support from some GOP legislators:\n\nWatch GOP Sen. Mike Lee publicly urge Indian contract-workers to lobby US Senators for a bill offering fast-track citizenship to Indian grads if they take jobs (at low wages) from US grads. No GOP Sen. has rebuked him & no anti-GOP journos 'pounce.' Weird. https://t.co/A5VOsuyOVt \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 18, 2019\n\nFor the moment, Donald Trump\u2019s administration is zig-zagging between the demands of its business allies and appeals from the swing-voting college graduate class.\n\n(2/2) Moving and powerful. Lots of powerful competing interests, but we need to remember that the American immigration system is first and foremost supposed to be for the protection and benefit of America and Americans. \u2014 USCIS Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli (@USCISCuccinelli) October 18, 2019\n\n\u201cThe president has made no secret of the fact that he believes immigration, first and foremost, is set up to work for America \u2014 that means economically and for the people here,\u201d Cuccinelli told reporters at a press breakfast organized by the Christian Science Monitor.\n\nFinding the right balance between helping American workers and American investors is a constant political dilemma, Cuccinelli said:\n\nIs there some perfect [balanced] target point in every industry? Maybe there is, but we\u2019re never going to be able to know it. So which side do you err on? And he has repeatedly emphasized how important it is to protect U.S. workers. Now\u2019s he been clear with me, as well, and you all have heard him say it: he wants to see economic growth and dynamism. And that means, you know, growing companies needing to fill slots. So we\u2019re just in a constant battle to balance those things.", "description": "President Donald Trump is converting the former \"country club\" GOP party to the party of blue-collar America, says the Wall Street Journal.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/Trump-Protect-American-Workers-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
