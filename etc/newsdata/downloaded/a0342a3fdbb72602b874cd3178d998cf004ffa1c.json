In fact, when it comes to the state of the planet and the threats posed by climate change, I'd describe it as a little closer to despair.\n\nHe and his peers have so many questions: What can I do given the magnitude of the issues? How are we going to live on a planet with increasingly catastrophic cycles of drought and rain? Why aren't world leaders doing more to solve this problem?\n\nIn the not-too-distant future, members of my son's generation will run the world. They will be driving consumer trends, voting on the issues important to them, and holding positions of power.\n\nIn the meantime, the fundamental responsibility to lean into real, accelerating issues like climate change rests upon the business and political leaders of today. And we need to do more, and do it faster.\n\nAt Mars, we have a carbon footprint across our entire value chain that is roughly the same as that of a small country. With this scale comes responsibility.\n\nAs I write this, I'm preparing to travel to New York for the U.N. General Assembly (UNGA) and Climate Week events, where I'll join leaders in business, government, and non-governmental organizations to address action on key issues facing society and the planet.\n\nRead more: The long overdue rise of rental is good for the retail industry \u2014 if we can get past a few glaring hurdles\n\nHow we're tackling the crisis at Mars\n\nThe urgency going into this event is real. In recent months, the science has revealed that the planet is already nearly 1\u00b0C warmer and scientists warn that once the temperature increases by 1.5\u00b0C future generations will face increasingly disruptive impacts on our societies, our economies, and the natural world.\n\nAt Mars, we are pledging to respond to this updated assessment with new commitments, and are working to build increased resilience into our agricultural supply chains.\n\nStephen Badger. Courtesy of Stephen Badger\n\nWe believe that the world we want tomorrow starts with how we do business today. That ideal drives us as a family business that thinks in terms of generations. It's also at the heart of our Sustainable in a Generation Plan and the $1 billion investment we've made behind that plan to start tackling issues like climate change, poverty, and water stress within our supply chain.\n\nWorldwide we are now sourcing 53% of the electricity we use in our operations (factories/offices) from renewables. We've also merged our sustainability and procurement activities to move beyond traditional commodity buying where price is the primary driver.\n\nAnd, we are simplifying our supply chains to increase transparency, and our ability to audit and take action to lower GHG emissions, reduce our impact on land and water, and create opportunities for people, particularly smallholder farmers.\n\nRead more: Women drive the vast majority of spending decisions in the US \u2014 here are 4 crucial things all salespeople should know about selling to them\n\nOur message to global business leaders: We must do more\n\nWe are sincere in our aspirations and optimistic about our ability to do our part. But, we're just one company. The net impact of global business is tremendous, and the opportunity for global business to change the course we are on is enormous.\n\nSo, as we head into UNGA/Climate Week, our call to action is for all businesses, government leaders, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to step up the actions they are taking to tackle climate change and to increase the pace of progress on the critical issues which threaten our collective potential.\n\nNo one should have the right to compromise the future of our children by maintaining a comfortable status quo. Nor are incremental improvements enough; we must be thinking in terms of transformative change.\n\nAs the leaders of today, we have a moral obligation to change the trajectory we are on for the generation right behind us. This year's UNGA/Climate Week should be a tipping point that will yield accelerated and impactful action and change the trajectory we are on.\n\nLike all parents, I want my son to have a life full of opportunities. Coming out of UNGA/Climate week, I want him and his contemporaries to see that we are taking meaningful action and that our efforts will bring us closer to a future with a rich and diverse planet, on which all people can thrive.\n\nStephen Badger is chairman of the board for Mars, a +$35B private, family business committed to purpose-led value creation.", "description": "Stephen Badger is the chairman of Mars, which has committed to a $1 billion plan to tackle climate change.
