The law is very clear,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe very idea that the subject of the complaint is who he went to to find out if it was OK to go forward, I think, is wrong,\u201d she added.\n\nMr. Maguire is facing the same pressure as he sits in front of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nIn light of accusations that his actions were improper, he argued that he couldn\u2019t legally bring the information to Congress because the White House cited executive privilege over the phone call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky, but that he was not instructed to withhold the information.\n\nHowever, Mrs. Pelosi said it was clear the White House was leading a cover-up of the phone call, pointing to a detail in the complaint that described officials using a code-level computer security system to \u201chide\u201d the call.\n\n\u201cWhatever other explanation there might be, an explanation is also that is a cover-up,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the president has been engaged in a cover-up all along. Why else would he be obstructing in the courts?\u201d\n\nAt the center of this explosive episode are allegations put forward by the whistleblower that Mr. Trump pressured the Ukrainian president into investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nBoth the whistleblower complaint and the inspector general\u2019s report on the allegations were publicly released by the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.\n\nThe White House also released a transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call with Mr. Zelensky on Wednesday, showing the two did discuss Mr. Biden but did not have any examples of using military aid as leverage.\n\nThe president has denied his actions were wrong and accused the Democrats of trying to \u201cdestroy\u201d the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cThat the president thinks that this proves his innocence only goes to show how further he doesn\u2019t understand right from wrong,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
