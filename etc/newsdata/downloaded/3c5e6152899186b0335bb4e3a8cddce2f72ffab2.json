The other is a 16-year-old who went on China\u2019s first climate strike.\n\nZhao Jiaxin and Howey Ou are part of a small but growing minority of young Chinese determined to press their country towards more radical carbon-cutting action. The pair are also China\u2019s sole winners of carbon neutral \u201cgreen tickets\u201d the UN is providing to 100 young people around the world.\n\nChina is the world\u2019s leading carbon emitter. It generates 60% of its electricity from coal-fired power and coal consumption and carbon emissions have risen for two years in a row after a plateau between 2014 and 2016. Emissions are expected to rise again in the figures for this year.\n\nYet within the country, the positive half of the picture is more likely to be heard: how devoted the nation is to Xi Jinping\u2019s goal of constructing an \u201cecological civilisation\u201d, how China is a climate change leader compared with the US, and how much record-breaking renewable energy capacity it continues to install.\n\nHowey does not think this is enough. She conducted a public climate strike in front of government offices in Guilin in southern China for several days in late May \u2013 Greta Thunberg called her a \u201ctrue hero\u201d \u2013 before the authorities said she had to stop because she did not have a permit.\n\nThe 16-year-old, who spends her spare time planting trees around her hometown, was nominated to travel to this week\u2019s United Nations climate summit in New York by the youth activist group Earth Uprising and nearly had to back out of attending because her chaperone was worried she would not stick to the Chinese government script.\n\n\u201cPeople in China don\u2019t know the situation and think the Chinese government is doing a lot and is great,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe point is that people here can\u2019t petition to protest and do something about the climate. Even if people want to change [things] they think activism in China will fail and the cost is too [high].\u201d\n\nIn a country where the party line controls the climate debate to the extent that a general apathy infuses the broader public, Howey and Zhao are the sudden, fresh young faces of environmental activism.\n\nThere are some signs they are not alone. Young people and women living in cities are increasingly aware of global climate issues and China\u2019s place at the centre of them, according to a recent study in the journal The China Quarterly.\n\n\u201cIn China, the good news is that compared to the population, younger Chinese tend to be more concerned about climate change,\u201d said Liu Xinsheng, the lead author of the report from Texas A&M University. \u201cThe bad news is that overall, average Chinese climate change concern is low relative to many countries around the world.\u201d\n\nZhao\u2019s passion for climate issues was triggered by the documentary Under the Dome, which he watched four years ago while studying engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zhao Jiaxin: \u2018I found something I could do for society.\u2019 Photograph: Supplied\n\nThe film inspired him to set up an NGO to raise awareness of the climate crisis on campus and create a platform disseminating information on the social media app WeChat.\n\n\u201cI found something I could do for society,\u201d Zhao said of his awakening after seeing the film. \u201cIn my last year [at university] I felt that if I did not communicate, did not advocate about what I thought was true, then powerful [other ideas] would dominate society.\u201d\n\nUnder the Dome, an examination of the policy failures and personal effects of air pollution in China, appeared online for several days in February and was viewed by as many as 300 million people before being banned.\n\nIt is unlikely there will be climate strikes in China on Friday like those being staged in the west. The country passed a law after the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 that imposed strict conditions on public gatherings and forced groups to register with the police if they want to stage a protest.\n\nOrganisations connected to the government such as the China Youth Climate Action Network, founded in 2007, are one of the official routes young people can take to raise climate awareness. The group holds events and educational training to help raise awareness of climate issues among China\u2019s young people.\n\nZheng Xiaowen, CYCAN\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think student protests are a helpful solution to the problem in China. Because of the unique cultural and political circumstances, Chinese people tend to resort to more moderate ways to voice their concerns.\n\nHowey Ou (@howey_ou) #FridaysForFuture I don\u2019t have to stuck in the way of striking,I must do what I could do right now.If I keep\u2018preparing\u2019,the time will lose.While the time is the most gracious thing to survive from climate crisis.Planted 6 trees in 13th,Sep.Starting #PlantforSurvive,This is WEEK1. pic.twitter.com/IFvFW0ypN8\n\n\u201cWe need to advocate actions against climate change in ways that best suit China. For us, the best way is to work with the government and help come up with plans to tackle those issues together.\u201d\n\nWhile small steps are being made, the lack of awareness of climate change in the country is alarming, Liu said, because China is the world\u2019s leading greenhouse gas emitter and one of the countries that could be badly affected by extreme weather events and rising sea levels, with knock-on effects for the economy and health.\n\n\u201cChina has top-down policymaking,\u201d Liu said. \u201cIt is hard to imagine without public awareness and concern for climate issues that the government policies will be successful.\u201d\n\nNo Chinese media outlets have signed up to a global pledge to increase coverage of the climate crisis in the week leading up to the UN summit on Friday, a pledge 250 media groups have agreed to including the Guardian and Bloomberg.\n\nThe inertia bothers Howey, but she believes there is hope: \u201cIt is frustrating to me, but I\u2019m still alive and have the passion for change.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdditional research contributions from Zhong Yunfan", "description": "Zhao Jiaxin and Howey Ou are trying to convince Beijing to take radical carbon-cutting action", "authors": ["Michael Standaert In Shenzen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/013fcfb2fe5755aabbca1bde23ee0ac6c0e32048/71_0_1260_756/master/1260.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=85ee48fd5775170bea704e3b76232693", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
