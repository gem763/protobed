In February this year, a contest against Kelvin Gastelum was scrapped hours before the fight was set to take place in Melbourne\u2019s Rod Laver arena, because Whittaker suffered a collapsed bowel and internal hernia on his intestine.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSo on Sunday, UFC President Dana White will be hoping that the champion of his 185lbs division makes it into the Octagon unscathed (if not out of it in that condition) for the first time in 16 months. White will hope that Marvel Stadium hosts a battle worthy of an Avengers film as Whittaker puts his strap on the line against the undefeated Israel Adesanya.\n\nFor a lot of fans and pundits, the main event is too close to call. Some bookies are even offering the exact same odds on each fighter. And as remarkable as that is, one can see why.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

REUTERS\n\nIn one corner stands the undefeated challenger, Adesanya (17-0). The 30-year-old is being marketed as the young lion ahead of Sunday\u2019s event despite being two years Whittaker\u2019s senior, but that is due to his recent and electric arrival in the UFC. \u2018The Last Stylebender\u2019 is a fitting nickname for a fighter as versatile as the Nigerian-born New Zealander, who dictates fights with his lethally precise and unpredictable striking. Adesanya\u2019s last fight \u2013 a unanimous decision victory over Gastelum to win the interim middleweight title \u2013 was his sixth UFC win in as many bouts in the space of just 14 months. He has been as prolific as he has been impressive, achieving wins over the likes of Brad Tavares, Derek Brunson, and MMA legend Anderson Silva \u2013 his idol.\n\nIn the other corner: Whittaker (20-4). On his way to earning the division\u2019s crown, the Aussie faced and defeated a murderer\u2019s row of opponents \u2013 \u2018Jacare\u2019 Souza, Tavares, Brunson, Uriah Hall, Rafael Natal (not a misspelling of a certain tennis player) \u2013 and anyone thinking his fragility between fights suggests a frailty during them is... only half right.\n\n\u2018The Reaper\u2019 exhibited a certain durability in his astonishing, career-defining achievement of surviving two fights \u2013 10 rounds, 50 minutes \u2013 with the walking mass of Cuban muscle that is Yoel Romero. In fact, Whittaker emerged with his hand raised on both occasions. The second time, however, that hand was broken, and the first time, Whittaker was propping himself up on a ruptured knee.\n\nSo it seems the champion\u2019s mind is constantly at odds with his own body, which is on a perennial quest to betray him. Usually, Whittaker\u2019s skill and determination see him over the line, but at what cost? He last stepped foot in the Octagon in June 2018.\n\nIf Sunday\u2019s fight were decided purely on form, the lanky, rangy Adesanya would unquestionably win. But in a sport where undefeated fighters can see their records and chins eviscerated in five-second contests (sorry, Ben Askren), predicting outcomes is not that simple.\n\nWhittaker possesses as eclectic a skillset as his challenger. He is no less precise and he packs greater power. Gastelum \u2013 despite a distinct height and reach disadvantage \u2013 was able to land regularly and heavily on Adesanya earlier this year, and should have finished \u2018Stylebender\u2019. While Whittaker still has a shorter reach and height than his opponent this weekend, the deficits are not as severe as they were for Gastelum, who is also slower and less well-rounded than \u2018The Reaper\u2019.\n\nGiven the amount of damage Gastelum was able to do to \u2018Stylebender\u2019 when the pair fought, the experienced Whittaker should be able to inflict enough of an assault on Adesanya on Sunday to leave Marvel Stadium with his belt still around his waist.\n\nBut unlike an Avengers film, MMA rarely follows the script. Fans can only hope that Whittaker makes it to the final act in one piece on Sunday.\n\nIf he does, expect a war Down Under.", "description": "As the UFC comes to Melbourne, Australia this weekend, middleweight champion Robert Whittaker will be hoping the third time is the charm.
