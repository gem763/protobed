Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., on Wednesday took steps to try to force a vote on his motion to condemn and censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for his \"egregiously false and fabricated\" reading of President Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky during a hearing last month.\n\nBiggs, who slammed the hearings in the impeachment inquiry into Trump as \u201cSoviet-style proceedings,\u201d brought his resolution to the floor after receiving the support of 135 Republican lawmakers in the lower chamber of Congress.\n\n\u201cWe follow rules even when they are represented by the minority party,\" Biggs said on the House floor. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening today. That\u2019s why we have to introduce this motion to censure. No more secret proceedings. No more Soviet-style proceedings.\u201d\n\nBOLTON INSTRUCTED FORMER RUSSIA ADVISER TO ALERT NSC LAWYER OVER UKRAINE, ADVISER TESTIFIES\n\nThe House now has two legislative days to decide when it would debate and vote on Biggs' privileged censure resolution of Schiff. It is assumed, however, that Democrats on Thursday will offer up a motion to table the resolution.\n\nDemocrats have the majority and control the floor in the House, but Republicans could still attempt to force a vote on the matter.\n\nBiggs was one of a number of Republican lawmakers who were barred earlier in the day from seeing the transcript of last week\u2019s testimony by U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker.\n\n\u201cThis is a secret,\u201d Biggs said earlier in the day. \u201cAnd the only information you're getting out of what's happening there is coming from the leaks that are coming out from the Democrats.\u201d\n\nThe resolution to censure Schiff -- who has become a favorite target of Republicans for his role in the Trump impeachment inquiry -- was first introduced late last month by Biggs, the Arizona Republican who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus. It quickly gained the support of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., among other ranking Republicans in the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nSchiff, who is leading one of the committees investigating Trump in the impeachment inquiry announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has been under fire from conservatives for the \u201cparody\u201d of the president\u2019s call with Zelensky that he read at the testimony last month of Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\nGIULIANI 'DISAPPOINTED' IN BOLTON AMID CLAIM HE TOLD AIDE TO ALERT LAWYER TO UKRAINE PROBE\n\nMaguire was on Capitol Hill to defend his handling of the explosive whistleblower complaint detailing how Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nThe complaint contains allegations related to Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky in July, when he urged him to investigate alleged corruption involving the Bidens.\n\nThe White House last month released an unclassified version of the transcript of the phone call. The memo, which does not reflect a \u201cverbatim transcript\u201d but is based on \u201cnotes and recollections\u201d of those memorializing the call, shows Trump suggesting Zelensky pursue some kind of investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden.\n\nOn the dais during Maguire\u2019s testimony, Schiff gave his own exaggerated version of the phone call.\n\n\u201cI have a favor I want from you,\u201d Schiff said while appearing to read from a paper. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSchiff has defended the version of the phone call he read at the testimony and chalked up his fictional summary of the controversial phone call to parody.\n\n\u201cMy summary of the president\u2019s call was meant to be at least, part, in parody,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe fact that that\u2019s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself. Of course, the president never said, \u2018If you don\u2019t understand me I\u2019m going to say it seven more times\u2019; my point is, that\u2019s the message that the Ukraine president was receiving in not so many words.\u201d\n\nSchiff\u2019s office did not return Fox News\u2019 request for comment on the resolution to censure him.\n\nFox News' Mike Emanuel contributed to this report.", "description": "Rep.
