WarnerMedia also says it will be free for HBO Now subscribers and for viewers who subscribe to HBO via AT&T. And it will launch in May of next year.\n\nThe announcement came at an event for investors and media, where HBO\u2019s Casey Bloys also revealed that the network has greenlit a Game of Thrones spin-off called House of the Dragon, based on George R.R. Martin\u2019s book of Westerosi history, Fire and Blood (perhaps explaining why a previously announced spin-off that was recently canceled).\n\nThe company also revealed that HBO Max will be the exclusive streaming home of South Park. Plus, Elizabeth Banks, Issa Rae and Mindy Kaling are all developing new shows for the service \u2014 and Arrow and Riverdale producer Greg Berlanti announced that he\u2019s working on the new DC Comics-related titles Green Lantern and Strange Adventures.\n\nToday\u2019s presentation for began with lots of commentary about all the corporate synergies between AT&T, WarnerMedia (which AT&T acquired last year) and the service\u2019s namesake HBO.\n\nWarnerMedia\u2019s entertainment and direct-to-consumer chairman Bob Greenblatt said HBO Max will have 10,000 hours of content at launch, including the HBO library, films from Warner Bros. and original content \u201cappealing to all the younger demos.\u201d Ten thousand hours sounds like a lot, but Greenblatt acknowledge it\u2019s less than some competitors (presumably Netflix): \u201cWe actually think our value proposition improves when we narrow some of the options.\u201d\n\nHBO Max Chief Content Officer Kevin Reilly made a similar point, noting that on average, half of the usage on subscription streaming services comes from the top 100 titles, so \u201cquality over quantity\u201d is important. To illustrate that quality, he pointed to titles like Sesame Street, as well as the Lord of the Rings movies, The Hobbit movies, The Matrix trilogy and The Conjuring films, plus every Superman and Batman movie from the past 40 years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all-in with DC and the associated brand-love that DC generates,\u201d Reilly said.\n\nHe also noted the service will stream the 90\u2019s classic Friends, as well as The Big Bang Theory, for which it reportedly paid over $1 billion.\n\nAs for originals, Reilly said the company plans to launch 31 Max Originals series (combined with HBO series, that makes for 69 original shows on HBO Max in its first year). Half of them, apparently, will be targeted at a young adult audience, with most of the episodes released on a weekly basis \u2014 Reilly argued that this allows for more cultural impact, \u201crather than fading quickly after a binge and burn.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the product itself, WarnerMedia\u2019s Executive Vice President Andy Forssell argued that \u201cdespite a decade of SVOD evolution, it\u2019s still too hard to find something to watch,\u201d and said HBO Max will \u201cblend the smart use of data with real human touch, and present them via novel product experiences.\u201d\n\nHe then showed off how the service will include curated highlights sections focusing on things like Friends episodes with high-profile guest stars. Forssell acknowledged that this might not seem revolutionary, but he argued that it offers a \u201csignificant deviation from how SVOD services have used screen real estate.\u201d\n\nIt will also expand HBO\u2019s Recommended by Humans feature, where celebrities and other real people can recommend their favorite movies and TV shows. And there will be kids\u2019 profiles and shared profiles \u2014 so that the watching you do with others won\u2019t interfere with the progress and recommendations from your own solo viewing.\n\nIn July, AT&T first announced its plans for HBO Max, but the details around launch and pricing weren\u2019t yet known. Instead, the attention so far has been on HBO Max\u2019s content lineup.\n\nThe service aims to capitalize on HBO\u2019s reputation for premium fare to attract consumers \u2014 many of whom already pay $15 per month for HBO Now. But it will pad that HBO library with a combination of programming from other WarnerMedia properties like Cinemax, New Line, DC Entertainment, Warner Bros., The CW, CNN, TNT, TBS, TruTV, Turner Classic Movies, Crunchyroll, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, Rooster Teeth, Looney Tunes, and others.\n\nWe now know HBO Max will be home to Game of Thrones and its upcoming spin-offs, plus favorite HBO series like The Sopranos, Sex and the City, Deadwood, Westworld, and others.\n\nIt\u2019s also bringing back Gossip Girl, rebooting Grease, making a Dune TV show, and streaming all 21 Studio Ghibli films.\n\nOther HBO Max shows will include a Riverdale spin-off Katy Keene; Search Party; Batwoman; Adventure Time; Stephen King\u2019s The Outsider; Jordan Peele and J.J. Abrams\u2019 horror series Lovecraft Country; Joss Whedon\u2019s The Nevers; Julian Fellowes\u2019 (Downton Abbey) The Gilded Age; David E. Kelley\u2019s The Undoing; Rules of Magic, a prequel to Alice Hoffman\u2019s Practical Magic; The Boondocks; and Gremlins: Secrets of the Mogwai; plus back catalog content like Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Pretty Little Liars, Doctor Who (2005 and onward), The West Wing, Top Gear, The Office (original version), and others.\n\nUpcoming literary adaptions include Tokyo Vice, The Flight Attendant, Circe, Made for Love, Station Eleven, and Anna K: A Love Story.\n\nMore recently, HBO Max has announced a new documentary on Anthony Bourdain, an overall deal with Lisa Ling, a documentary about Amy Schumer, a Melissa McCarthy comedy film, a documentary with Monica Lewinsky, and a new deal with J.J. Abrams\u2019 Bad Robot (the deal allows Bad Robot to make TV under the WarnerMedia umbrella and then sell it to other streaming services).\n\nAbrams was part of today\u2019s event. He said it\u2019s too early to announce any specific programming under the new deal \u2014 Bad Robot already works with HBO on titles like Westworld, and Abrams has a new show in the works called Demimonde \u2014 but he declared, \u201cThere\u2019s no company that values storytelling more than WarnerMedia.\u201d\n\nAnd for classic movie lovers who mourn the loss of FilmStruck, Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff said the service will offer a rich library of films from the Warner Bros. and MGM catalog, curated titles from Turner Classic Movies, as well as \u201cdecades and decades of more great titles from The Criterion Collection.\u201d\n\nAT&T said on Monday it plans to spend about $2 billion on the service over the next two years and aims to sign up some 50 million subscribers by 2025.\n\nThe service will arrive at a time when competition in the streaming market is heating up. Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video\u2019s successes have paved the way for new entrants like Apple TV+, which launches Friday, and Disney+, which arrives mid-November. NBCU is also joining next year with its streaming service Peacock, which will offer The Office and other classic shows, alongside new originals, like a Battlestar Galactica reboot.\n\nThese streamers are gaining at the expense of traditional TV, which has impacted other parts of AT&T\u2019s business.\n\nIn the third quarter, it lost another 1.2 million satellite and fiber-optic-TV customers as well as 195,000 AT&T TV Now (previously DirecTV Now) subscribers. AT&T\u2019s profit was down 22% year-over-year to $3.7 billion and revenue had fallen 2.5% to $44.6 billion.\n\nEventually, AT&T\u2019s plan is to merge its AT&T TV Now live TV service into HBO Max and add on a discounted ad-supported tier to HBO Max to make it more affordable.", "description": "AT&T and WarnerMedia just announced the pricing of their HBO Max streaming service, along with sharing more details about the timing and content lineup.
