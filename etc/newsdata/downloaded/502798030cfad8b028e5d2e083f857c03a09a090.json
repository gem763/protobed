Lauer, she said, didn\u2019t use lubricant. The encounter was excruciatingly painful. \u2018It hurt so bad. I remember thinking, Is this normal?\u2019 She told me she stopped saying no, but wept silently into a pillow.\u201d\n\nNevils tells Farrow: \u201cIt was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent [and said] multiple times that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u201d\n\nShe said she had more sexual encounters with Lauer when they returned to New York, adding: \u201cIt was completely transactional. It was not a relationship.\u201d\n\nAfter Nevils reported her ordeal to NBC executives, Lauer was eventually fired.\n\nCatch and Kill is published on 15 October.", "description": "Matt Lauer has been accused of rape by his former NBC colleague Brooke Nevils, whose complaint against him led to his firing from the Today show in 2017.", "authors": ["Ellie Harrison"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/29/13/matt-lauer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
