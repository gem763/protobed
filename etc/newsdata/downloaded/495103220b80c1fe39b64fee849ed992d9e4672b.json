REUTERS/Ali Hashisho\n\nAnti-government protests that have swept the country since Thursday have pulled together all segments of Lebanese society in an unusually unified call for the downfall of a political elite that protesters blame for plunging the economy into crisis.\n\nYoung protesters carrying rubbish bags arrived early in central Beirut on Sunday to clean debris left from festive demonstrations the day before, while groups of marchers with drums and loudspeakers returned to keep momentum.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect people from the country\u2019s north, south and Beirut to join hands and like each other. The protests have brought together everyone and this has never happened before,\u201d said Sahar Younis, a 32-year-old worker with a non-governmental organization.\n\nHariri gave his feuding coalition partners a 72-hour deadline on Friday to agree to reforms that could ward off economic crisis, hinting he may otherwise resign. He accused his rivals of obstructing budget measures that could unlock $11 billion in Western donor pledges and help avert economic collapse.\n\nIf Hariri, a Sunni Muslim who is traditionally backed by the West and Sunni Gulf Arab allies, resigns it would be harder for the various parties that make up the ruling coalition to form a new cabinet.\n\nA new cabinet would also likely see the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies more in control, a shift that would make it nearly impossible for international donors or Gulf Arab countries at odds with Iran to offer aid or investments.\n\nGovernment sources said Hariri was waiting for his coalition to get on board with the economic proposals, which include taxes on banks and a plan to overhaul the country\u2019s costly and crumbling state electricity utility.\n\nLate on Saturday the Maronite Christian Lebanese Forces party announced it would withdraw its four ministers from the government, piling further pressure on Hariri as he seeks to pass a budget that his government has pledged would include no new taxes.\n\nThe Association of Banks in Lebanon announced that all banks would be closed on Monday because of the unrest.\n\n\u201cWe want to stay in Lebanon to build our future but if these corrupt politicians stay here what future will be left for us?\u201d said 17-year-old student Cherbel Anton.\n\nHEZBOLLAH SUPPORT\n\nHezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has thrown his powerful Shi\u2019ite group\u2019s weight behind the current government, saying the country\u2019s deep economic crisis means precious time should not be wasted forming a new one.\n\nNasrallah said on Saturday that imposing more taxes on people could lead to an \u201cexplosion\u201d of unrest.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t work toward a solution we\u2019re heading toward a collapse of the country, it will be bankrupt and our currency will not have any value,\u201d he said.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\n\u201cThe second danger is a popular explosion as a result of wrong handling of the situation.\u201d\n\nThe budget could help one of the world\u2019s most indebted countries unlock some $11 billion that was pledged by international donors last year but is conditional on long-delayed reforms to curb waste and corruption.\n\nThe mounting unrest was triggered in part by a proposed fee on WhatsApp calls, a measure which was quickly scrapped but that was seen by many as the latest government attempt to squeeze citizens receiving little in return from the state.", "description": "Protesters in Lebanon returned to the streets early on Sunday, keeping pressure on Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri as a self-imposed deadline to deliver a package of badly needed reforms for the country's crumbling economy drew near.", "authors": ["Eric Knecht", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442991891&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0D7", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
