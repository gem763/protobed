Asked how troubling they find the allegations against the former vice-president, 32 per cent said not at all \u2013 while only 19 per cent said they found the claims \u201cextremely\u201d troubling.\n\nIn turn, the majority of respondents - 38 per cent - said they found Mr Trump\u2019s dealings with the Ukrainian president extremely troubling, compared to 26 per cent who said the situation was not troubling at all.\n\nMeanwhile 66 per cent said it was not appropriate for the president to ask foreign leaders to investigate his rivals \u2013 compared to 25 per cent who said such actions would be appropriate.\n\nThe poll is the latest to find public support for impeachment growing as proceedings against the president gain pace.\n\nHowever, while Democrats in the house are likely to rule in favour of the president\u2019s removal, it is unlikely the Republican-controlled Senate will endorse the move.\n\nIn order for that to happen \u2014 a situation that would force Mr Trump from office, making Mike Pence the next commander-in-chief \u2014 roughly 20 Republicans would need to abandon Mr Trump, and join a unified Democratic front.\n\nNo US president has ever been removed from office by a vote of impeachment.\n\nIn 1974 Richard Nixon resigned before a vote could take place, while both Bill Clinton in 1998 and Andrew Johnson in 1868 both retained their positions after they were not removed by the senate.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump has turned the US into an inept, unreliable ally", "description": "A Fox News poll has found that a majority of US voters want Donald Trump to be impeached.The White House said on Wednesday it would refuse to co-operate with the inquiry being led by House Democrats into whether the president should be removed from office \u2013 with lawyers rejecting the move as \u201cbaseless", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JqEYinrfJKLvjS3XTLRHSw--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/61a543863d8cb175e57baac590381391", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
