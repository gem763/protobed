Was it under pressure from Beijing, where the Hong Kong leader visited last week for China's National Day parade, or was it due to some misguided notion from her own advisers that the move would temper the unrest?\n\nIt had the opposite effect. Hours after the ban came into effect, Hong Kong looked like a war zone as street fights broke out across the city, fires burned outside railway stations, and a 14-year-old was shot by police during one of the many clashes with protesters during the night.\n\nThe outbreak of violence left the city paralysed over the weekend, with the city's entire underground metro network down, streets deserted and supermarkets closed. Authorities had to deny rumours they planned to suspend the stockmarket on Tuesday or freeze the assets of its citizens.\n\nHong Kong was limping back to life on Monday morning but many of its residents, including some of the 100,000 Australians living there, are more concerned about the city's future than at any other time in the past four months of unrest. Foreign Minister Marise Payne says the situation is \"very concerning\".\n\nThe face mask ban will not stop the vandalism and the weekly outbreaks of violence on the streets. Instead, it will only fuel the resentment many Hong Kong citizens - not just the young protesters taking to the streets - have for a government they no longer trust and are beginning to fear.", "description": "Instead of ending the unrest which has gripped Hong Kong for the past four months, the government's face mask ban had the opposite effect.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2586%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_82/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0e19e0804616fff7510d24a055cc3dc97813fe81", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
