A twist of fate that saw him tog out for the Musgrave Park outfit during an unforgettable year.\n\nJackson would return to his native New Zealand and began an adventure, both as a player and a coach, which would lead to him meeting an Irish side again this weekend - namely Joe Schmidt\u2019s men in a crucial World Cup encounter.\n\nThe 48-year-old is now head coach of Samoa, the final obstacle in Ireland\u2019s quest to qualify for the knockout stages. And here we are, meeting in the lobby of Samoa\u2019s team hotel in Fukuoka two days out from that pivotal Pool A clash.\n\nSteve Jackson will lead his Samoa team against Ireland at the Rugby World Cup on Saturday\n\nHe made his way over to Ireland as a player after being told he wasn't needed by Auckland\n\nGLORY DAYS\n\nIt\u2019s been quite the journey for Jackson. A highly-rated player in his youth, he represented New Zealand at U17, secondary and U19 level before graduating into Auckland\u2019s ranks. That mighty province were coached by Graham Henry at the time - a man who would go on to guide the All Blacks to World Cup in 2011.\n\nBut Henry would drop a bombshell on Jackson a few weeks before the beginning of the new season. \u2018He sort of said to me, \u201cSteve, if you want to play, mate, you\u2019ll have to go to another province and that was probably about two weeks before the season started,\u2019 Jackson recalls.\n\n\u2018I was a bit down and out. Then I got a phone call from an agent out of the blue. I\u2019d never met the guy before and he said, \u201clook, would you be keen on going over to Ireland and playing footy over there\u201d and I was like \u201cyeah, of course I would\u201d.\n\n'And I was getting married that year so it sort of worked out to fly to Fiji, get married and then get on a plane and head to Ireland, so we did. Yeah, that\u2019s how it came about.\u2019\n\nAfter shining at Dolphin Rugby Club in Cork (pictured in 1998), he secured a move home\n\nYou could say Cork was his honeymoon destination? \u2018Yeah, exactly!\u2019 \u2018There's nothing better than going over for your honeymoon and playing footy! \u2018I arrived there at the end of \u201997, yeah it was awesome.\u2019\n\nIn a story punctuated with sliding doors moments, Declan Kidney had led Dolphin into the top tier of the All Ireland League, where heavyweights such as Shannon, Young Munster and Cork Constitution resided. Then Kidney got the call to coach Munster and was out the gap, but Dolphin still fancied their chances, particularly with a promising Kiwi forward coming on board.\n\nBorn Vaeluagaomatagi Steve Jackson in the west Auckland suburb of Henderson, he was known to his new teammates as \u2018Jacko\u2019, a teak-tough No8 who proved an instant hit - scoring the winning try on debut in a 25-24 victory over a star-studded Garryowen side, featuring the likes of David Wallace, Dominic Crotty and Jeremy Staunton.\n\n\u2018I remember getting carried off and they were all cheering. \u2018There was a little old guy, he used to have glasses. He fell asleep in church the following day and he woke up and stood up at the top of his voice and said \u201ccome on you beautiful Dolphin!\u201d and he just didn\u2019t realise he\u2019s been in church, he\u2019d been on the chop all night, brilliant!\n\nHe would carve out an impressive career on the Kiwi club scene, turning out for Southland\n\nHe recalls another clash with Highfield - another institution of Cork rugby - when Glen Jackson, now a seasoned international referee, was was playing out-half, another young globetrotting New Zealander. Those were the glory days of the old All Ireland League when big derby games would attract bumper crowds while the clubhouse bar would be packed to the rafters for hours after the final whistle.\n\nHe and his wife, Penny, were welcomed into the club with open arms and spent Christmas Day among their new comrades at Dolphin HQ. \u2018We got there at 7.30 in the morning and the place was chocka. We were on the beer at seven in the morning and they had the turkey in the oven. By the time we got to lunch time the turkey was perfect but I was p****d! \u2018Great times. It will be a time in my life that I will never forget.\u2019\n\nA back injury hindered his involvement but Jackson is still fondly remembered at the club. He still has his old Dolphin jersey. Eventually, Jackson got the ball to return to his native New Zealand when a former Auckland U21 coach offered him a place in his Southland squad. \u2018I was ready to head off and just spend a couple of years just travelling around and seeing what the world was like but I ended up coming back and going all the way back down to cold Invercargill! \u2018Then it started there for me.\u2019\n\nONE DIRECTION\n\nHe would carve out an impressive career on the Kiwi club scene, turning out for Southland, North Harbour and Tasman. Most notably, he represented the New Zealand Maori and played alongside Greg Feek - Ireland\u2019s scrum coach.\n\nFormer All Black Todd Blackadder - who coached Bath against Leinster last season - would give Jackson his big break at Tasman when he offered him the role of forwards coach. He would then move on to Counties-Manukau and work with Tana Umaga.\n\nThey are known as the \u2018Steelers\u2019 for a reason, the suburbs of south Auckland is a tough environment. The commute from his home on Auckland\u2019s Waiheke Island would prove punishing, but it would pay off in the end. \u2018Everybody in my family said \u201cyou\u2019re bloody mad\u201d, because for people on Waiheke Island, you\u2019ve got to catch a ferry into Auckland and then it takes you 45 minutes to an hour to get to training.\n\n'There was no payment, they were just giving me some petrol vouchers. It cost me about a grand a month to actually go down there and coach.\u2019\n\nThe pay off was the opportunity to mentor a young and vibrant squad containing current Samoa players Tim Nanai-Williams and Rey Lee-Lo, as well as a raw and explosive midfielder named Bundee Aki.\n\nEarly in his coaching career, Jackson worked with Irish ace Bundee Aki at Counties Manukau\n\nHe will line out against the land of his fathers on Saturday, but Jackson could not be more proud of his former protege.\n\n\u2018We had four guys in our team, we used to call them One Direction,\u2019 he recalled.\n\n\u2018They were singing group and Bundee was part of that. Lots of mischief but he\u2019s a great kid. Him and Ree Lee Lo were part of it and Tim Nanai Williams. They were kids that had nothing. South Auckland boys, Bundee Aki was living out in Ranui with his family.\n\n\u2018I watched him play his first Test (for Ireland) and I shed a bit of a tear and Penny, my wife, said, \"you\u2019ve known these boys a long time\u201d. 'To see him succeed and see what he\u2019s done. Even Ray who\u2019s in our team at the moment, they feel like your sons.\u2019\n\nJackson continues: \u2018He didn\u2019t have much and if he didn\u2019t get put on the right track he could have ended up somewhere else. He\u2019s done so well at Connacht and now look where he is. I know him. I know you have those people who say he\u2019s not Irish and all that but I know that he\u2019s the type of kid that will throw his feet into everything and become an Irishman.\n\n'I\u2019m bloody rapt for that kid. I can\u2019t wait to catch up with the guy. I just want to tell him, he\u2019s got enough money now, he\u2019s got to get a tooth in his mouth! Every time he smiles, he\u2019s still got that gap!\u2019\n\nANSWERING THE CALL\n\nNow, Jackson will be sitting in the coaches box on Saturday after another whirlwind 12 months in his coaching career. After stints with North Harbour and Auckland Blues, a chance meeting with a friend revealed that Samoa were advertising for the position of head coach.\n\n\u2018I applied for the job and a week later I was on an aeroplane and in Samoa going for my final interview and two days later I got the job. \u2018Then I had to name a team for the northern hemisphere tour in three days! \u2018I was just like \"who\u2019s available, we\u2019re going?\u201d I wake every day pinching myself after the journey that I\u2019ve had.\u2019\n\nHe has implored his three sons, Will, Cole and Taine to explore the world when they get older. He has implored his squad, who are playing for pride on Saturday, to enjoy their final outing in Japan. \u2018We\u2019ve just told our players you\u2019ve got nothing to lose, go out there and throw everything at it. I know that Ireland will do exactly the same.\u2019\n\nJackson has told his players they have nothing to lose against the strong Irish on Saturday\n\nAs France and Wales found out earlier this week, a Pacific Island team with no fear is a dangerous proposition. As for Jackson, he will reevaluate his next move after this World Cup campaign. He turned down a gig with the Southern Kings in the Pro14 last year but knowing \u2018Jacko', he could end up anywhere.\n\n\u2018My contract with Samoa finishes at the end of November and then I\u2019m not too sure,\u2019 he concludes. \u201cI could be back on Waiheke Island pumping gas or something! \u2018So, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u2019 Whatever Jackson does next, one thing is guaranteed: it will be exciting.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW BY RORY KEANE IN FUKUOKA: The 48-year-old is now head coach of Samoa, the final obstacle in Ireland's quest to qualify for the knockout stages at the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["Rory Keane For The Irish Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/21/19557242-0-image-a-50_1570739230306.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
