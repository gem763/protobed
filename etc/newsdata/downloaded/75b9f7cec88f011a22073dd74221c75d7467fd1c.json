Trump said the U.S. told Russia it was entering their airspace for an unspecified reason, although Moscow has since said they were unaware of the operation. Regardless, Pelosi argued she and other leaders of the House should have known what was going on much sooner.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump also faced some criticism for thanking Russia first, when listing off the countries or other allies, such as the Kurds, who aided the U.S. in some way en route to the mission's completion.\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers just didn't love how the president spoke so brazenly about the military operation, in which he described Baghdadi as \"whimpering and crying\" before he \"died like a dog.\" Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, told Jake Tapper during an appearance Sunday on CNN's State of the Union that he was \"a little uncomfortable\" with Trump's description, though he did say \"there's a value\" in making Baghdadi look \"less inspirational\" to potential followers.\n\n.@SpeakerPelosi calls death of al-Baghdadi \"significant\" but takes issue with fact that Russians were briefed on raid but congressional leadership was not: pic.twitter.com/IbDWa4E9JZ \u2014 Scott Wong (@scottwongDC) October 27, 2019", "description": "U.S. lawmakers have responded positively to the military raid that resulted in the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but that doesn't mean President Trump is getting off scot-free in their eyes.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) praised the \"heroism\" of the military", "authors": ["Tim O'Donnell"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
