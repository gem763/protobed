Emperors now have no political authority. A court banquet is due to be held on Tuesday evening, before Naruhito and Empress Masako host a tea party for foreign royalty on Wednesday (October 23) afternoon.\n\nThe throne, called \"Takamikura,\" is a 6.5-metre (21-foot) -high decorative structure resembling a gazebo at the Forbidden City in China.\n\nIt was transported from the former Imperial Palace in Japan's ancient capital of Kyoto, where emperors lived until 150 years ago.\n\nThe enthronement ceremony is the high point of several succession rituals that began in May when Naruhito inherited the throne.", "description": "Naruhito pledged to stay close to the people, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated him and led three \"banzai\" cheers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/96/62/1000x563_cmsv2_2167e044-15a1-5dc7-97df-ecfd08037549-4249662.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
