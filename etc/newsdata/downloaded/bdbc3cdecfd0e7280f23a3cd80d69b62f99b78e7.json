Mark Sanford on Sunday said he will mount a primary challenge to President Trump in 2020, jumping into the race after publicly toying with the idea for several months.\n\nHe said there needs to be a \u201cconversation\u201d on what it means to be a Republican.\n\n\u201cI think that as a Republican Party we have lost our way,\u201d said the former South Carolina governor on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nAsked if he honestly thinks he has a shot at winning, Mr. Sanford said: \u201cI\u2019m saying, you never know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing that has been lacking in this debate has been an earnest and real conversation on debt and deficits and government spending, and I find it astounding to watch the number of Democratic debates that I\u2019ve seen and no mention, no conversation on where we\u2019re going with regard to debt,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Sanford had previously instituted an informal deadline of Labor Day to decide whether to jump in, but postponed the decision as his state steeled for the arrival of Hurricane Dorian.\n\nMr. Sanford joins former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Rep. Joe Walsh as the most prominent candidates mounting long-shot primary challenges to Mr. Trump, who continues to enjoy overwhelming support among GOP voters.\n\nHe said there should also be a serious conversation about the president\u2019s tariff and trade policies, as well as on \u201chumility\u201d and a general approach to politics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to solve some of the profound problems that we have as Americans by tweet,\u201d Mr. Sanford said.\n\nMr. Sanford lost in a primary contest of his own last year after he had emerged as one of the few Republicans on Capitol Hill willing to publicly criticize the president.\n\nIn 2009, while serving as governor of South Carolina, he also admitted to a highly publicized extramarital affair. After an unexplained absence, his office said he had been hiking the Appalachian Trail when he had really been in Argentina with his then-girlfriend.\n\nMr. Sanford said Sunday that he went on an \u201capology tour\u201d after his indiscretions came to light, and that he learned another level of humility and empathy.\n\n\u201cAnd in contrast to the president, when he says there\u2019s not a single thing that he sort of regrets or apologizes for, I profoundly apologize for that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I believe in the Christian model of repentance and renewal and a second chance.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Sanford and others face a steep uphill climb against Mr. Trump, who is extraordinarily popular among Republicans and has labeled Mr. Sanford, Mr. Weld, and Mr. Walsh the \u201cThree Stooges.\u201d\n\nRep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, on Sunday said Mr. Sanford\u2019s energy would probably be better spent elsewhere.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s all come together and put this president back and reelect him, and I think that\u2019s what needs to happen in our party right now,\u201d Mr. Collins, Georgia Republican, said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanford\u2019s announcement also came as Republican parties in states like South Carolina, Nevada, and Kansas have moved to cancel or curtail their presidential nominating contests next year.\n\nMr. Weld and Mr. Walsh have cried foul, as the moves have invited criticism that the party is trying to shut down any opposition to Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThey are literally denying their residents the right to vote to protect this incumbent president,\u201d Mr. Walsh said in a recent appearance on CNN. \u201cThis president is like a mob boss and it\u2019s beyond disappointing. The Republican National Committee, the Republican Party that pretty much controls a lot of these state parties, they\u2019re doing all of Trump\u2019s bidding. They worship him. They\u2019re like a cult as well as so many of his voters.\u201d\n\nBut the state parties have said the moves are cost-saving measures, and defenders have pointed to the past precedent of both parties moving to cancel or curtail their presidential nominating contests when they have an incumbent president running for reelection.\n\nAs a general rule, there\u2019s \u201cno rationale\u201d to hold a primary when either party has an incumbent president in the White House, said Drew McKissick, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party.\n\n\u201cWith no legitimate primary challenger and President Trump\u2019s record of results, the decision was made to save South Carolina taxpayers over $1.2 million and forgo an unnecessary primary,\u201d Mr. McKissick said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
