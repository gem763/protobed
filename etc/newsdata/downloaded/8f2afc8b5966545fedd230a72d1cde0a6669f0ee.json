Tim Ryan Timothy (Tim) John RyanThe Hill's Campaign Report: DNC toughens December debate criteria DNC toughens qualification criteria for December debate Trump rips Tim Ryan after he drops out of Democratic race MORE (D-Ohio) became the latest to drop out last week. There are likely five candidates, at most, who have a realistic chance of becoming the nominee.\n\nWhat do they need to do?\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenBiden: Trump 'an idiot' for saying Russian interference a 'hoax' Biden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike MORE\n\nBiden was the undisputed frontrunner in the early stages and retains a slender lead in the RealClearPolitics (RCP) national polling average.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut Biden has come under pressure from Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenBiden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike Tlaib endorses Sanders at Detroit campaign rally MORE (D-Mass.) in particular. She has surpassed him in several national polls, and is also leading the polling averages in the two vital early states of Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nBiden needs to improve across the board if his early strength is not to melt away.\n\nThe former vice president\u2019s debate performances have been generally poor. At times he has meandered to such an extent that questions about his age and vigor become unavoidable. Biden is 76, which would make him the oldest person ever elected president if he won in 2020.\n\nBiden has also struggled in terms of fundraising, trailing in fourth in money raised in the third quarter. His campaign last week dropped its prior objections to super-PACs \u2014 a move presumably made out of necessity, but which drew criticism from Warren and her fellow progressive, Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersBiden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race Democratic lawmakers, 2020 candidates pay tribute to Conyers 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike MORE (I-Vt.).\n\nThere is a broader problem, too. There is little evidence, by any metric, that Biden is sparking any great excitement among the Democratic base.\n\nBiden\u2019s support has proven more durable than his critics expected but he is nearing a moment of truth.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass)\n\nWarren has shown far greater momentum than any other candidate in the race.\n\nShe can credibly claim to be a co-frontrunner, at least, alongside Biden, thanks to her polling standing in the early states, her fundraising prowess and the large crowds she draws to her rallies.\n\nBut her prominence brings challenges too. At the most recent debate, in Ohio, Warren came under far more sustained attack from her rivals than ever before. She held up adequately but unspectacularly. And there will likely be more jabs to come, starting with the next debate in Georgia on Nov. 20.\n\nWarren has often faced the critique that she is less electable against President Trump Donald John Trump'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Kayla Mueller's mother: Daughter might still be alive 'If Obama had been as decisive' as Trump MORE than more centrist figures such as Biden. She and her supporters vigorously push back against the charge but how persuasive she is on that point will be crucial, given the Democratic ardor for defeating Trump above all else.\n\nWarren\u2019s lead in Iowa is not a wide one \u2014 she is up by fewer than four points in the RCP average \u2014 and a loss there could put her whole strategy in peril.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\nSanders has bounced back since he had a heart attack early this month, delivering a vigorous \u201ccomeback\u201d performance at the Ohio debate and holding a huge New York City rally at which Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezTlaib endorses Sanders at Detroit campaign rally Sanders, Tlaib make donations to Detroit marching band Facebook Green New Deal ad tests Ocasio-Cortez's concerns about the platform MORE (D-N.Y.) delivered an emphatic endorsement of him.\n\nFor Sanders, the question is whether he can expand his support. While Warren\u2019s standing in the polls has risen consistently over time, Sanders has plateaued at best. He has not risen above 20 percent support in the RCP national average since May. He stood at 17.3 percent on Friday afternoon.\n\nSkeptics note that Sanders performed so strongly in 2016 in part because he was the only credible alternative to eventual nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonTrump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series The ship has sailed for Michael Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton Rep. Katie Hill resigns amid ethics probe MORE. A multi-candidate field has posed bigger challenges.\n\nStill, Sanders retains a fervent base of support, which in turn has given him a lot of money. He raised more than any other candidate in the third quarter\n\nCan Sanders use his money to somehow catapult himself past Warren in Iowa or New Hampshire? His viability as a potential nominee likely depends on it.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg Peter (Pete) Paul ButtigiegBiden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike 2020 Democrats commend US forces on ISIS leader's death MORE (D)\n\nButtigieg\u2019s appeal is plain: he is a very youthful, media-savvy messenger for the same kind of centrism espoused by Biden, who is almost 40 years his senior.\n\nIs that enough? Probably not, unless Biden\u2019s bid truly implodes.\n\nStill, Buttigieg has been making process in opinion polls, particularly in Iowa. A recent survey from Iowa State University put him in second place, behind Warren, with 20 percent support in the Hawkeye State.\n\nA strong performance in the first state could propel Buttigieg into real contention. But he has struggled mightily to elicit any significant support from black voters. Unless that changes, it will likely be fatal to any hopes he has of becoming the nominee.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris Kamala Devi HarrisDemocratic lawmakers, 2020 candidates pay tribute to Conyers 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike Harris reverses course, attends South Carolina justice forum MORE (D-Calif.)\n\nHarris has had a disappointing stretch of late.\n\nShe briefly soared in the polls after mounting a vigorous assault on Biden on race-related issues in the first debates in Miami in late June.\n\nBut she has slid since then, and now appears to have been eclipsed by Buttigieg. She is running at around 5 percent in national polling averages, and is polling even lower than that in Iowa.\n\nGetting voters to take a second look in such a crowded field is a challenge \u2014 and even more so for Harris, who has been dogged about questions as to her core beliefs and consistency throughout her campaign.\n\nShe can shine in debates, however, and will likely need to score big in the two remaining clashes this year if she hopes to vault back into real contention.\n\nSens.
