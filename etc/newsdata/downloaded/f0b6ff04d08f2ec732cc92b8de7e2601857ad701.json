Demers, called the crimes one of the most serious Iran sanctions violations his office has seen.\n\n'Halkbank, a Turkish state-owned bank, allegedly conspired to undermine the United States Iran sanctions regime by illegally giving Iran access to billions of dollars' worth of funds, all while deceiving U.S. regulators about the scheme,' he said.\n\n'This is one of the most serious Iran sanctions violations we have seen, and no business should profit from evading our laws or risking our national security.'\n\nThe indictment against the bank comes after one of its former executives, Mehmet Hakan Atilla (center), was found guilty and sentenced to prison after a trial in Manhattan federal court last year\n\nFBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. vowed to aggressively pursue those who intentionally violate U.S. sanctions laws and attempt to undercut national security.\n\n'Halkbank illegally facilitated the illicit transfer of billions of dollars to benefit Iran, and for far too long the bank and its leaders willfully deceived the United States to shield their actions from scrutiny. That deception ends today,' he said.\n\nHalkbank is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nA U.S. lawyer for Halkbank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe prosecutors are seeking to compel Halkbank to forfeit money and property, though they did not give a specific amount.\n\nThe charges came a day after President Donald Trump announced sanctions on Turkey over its military offensive against U.S.-allied Kurdish-led forces in northern Syria.\n\nTrump's unexpected decision to withhold protection from Syria's Kurds after a phone call with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Oct. 6 swiftly upended five years of U.S. policy on Syria.", "description": "The charges against Halkbank, whose majority shareholder is the government of Turkey, were announced on Tuesday by federal authorities in New York.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/23/19760616-0-image-a-4_1571177016543.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
