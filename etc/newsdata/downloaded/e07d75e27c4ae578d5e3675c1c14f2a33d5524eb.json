(Jacky Muniello/Bloomberg News)\n\nThe idea was to reach the United States. But when the young Honduran mother arrived in Mexico this summer, with only a handful of pesos and a 4-year-old in tow, she realized how difficult that had become.\n\nAnd so she came up with a new plan.\n\n\u201cThe American Dream is costly, very costly,\u201d lamented Iris, 32, sitting on a curb outside the Mexican refugee office in this southern city. She spoke on the condition that only her first name be used, for fear of harm from gang members in Honduras.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s still the dream. But if they give me Mexican papers, I\u2019ll stay here.\u201d\n\nIris is one in the soaring number of migrants seeking refuge throughout the Americas. And while the United States remains the world\u2019s top recipient of asylum petitions, countries such as Mexico, with much smaller asylum systems, are seeing far greater increases.\n\nPresident Trump complains of the sharp rise in applications for asylum in the United States, which more than tripled in seven years to 254,000 in 2018, according to global statistics compiled by the U.N. refu\u00adgee agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut asylum petitions in Mexico shot up more than 3,500 percent over the same period. They could nearly triple this year alone, to around 80,000.\n\nThe surge of asylum seekers in the hemisphere stems from a cascade of crises: the implosion of Venezuela, a crackdown on dissidents by the authoritarian government of Nicaragua, and agricultural disasters and gang violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\n\nIn Latin America, \u201cwe\u2019ve never seen such a large-scale exodus of people fleeing countries in deep political crisis,\u201d said Andrew Selee, head of the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute.\n\n[When they filed their asylum claim, they were told to wait in Mexico. There, they say, they were kidnapped.]\n\nNow, Mexico is dealing with another cause: steps by Trump to tighten the U.S. border, which are driving people to seek alternatives to the United States \u2014 and causing a bottleneck to the south.\n\nThe change is redefining the way Mexico sees itself. For decades, it was Mexicans who were the ones migrating, typically to the United States. This year, Mexico could become one of the top 10 recipients of asylum applications in the world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become more and more a country of destination for Central Americans,\u201d said William Spindler, the Latin America spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nThe Trump administration is hoping to send still more migrants to Latin American countries through agreements that would oblige them to take in the asylum seekers who cross their territories in hopes of reaching the U.S. border. But both Mexico and Panama have balked at signing the \u201csafe third country\u201d accords.\n\nIn Panama, like Mexico, asylum applications have surged, reaching 10,778 last year \u2014 a ninefold increase in five years, according to UNHCR. In addition, the country of 4 million is now home to more than 60,000 Venezuelans. Thousands more migrants and asylum seekers have traveled across Panama this year hoping to reach the United States.\n\n\u201cWe already have more than enough\u201d migrants, Panamanian President Laurentino Cortizo, said last month after meeting with Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security.\n\n[Trump wants border-bound asylum seekers to find refuge in Guatemala instead. Guatemala isn\u2019t ready.]\n\nThe Mexican city of Tapachula, around 10 miles from the Guatemalan border, offers a glimpse of the drastic change in migrant flows. By 7 o\u2019clock one recent morning, scores of Central Americans, Haitians and West Africans had lined up outside a low-slung, unmarked building. It was the office of the Mexican refugee commission, known by its Spanish initials, COMAR. Around two-thirds of the country\u2019s asylum applications are processed here.\n\nAs the migrants rubbed sleep from their eyes, women wandered past hawking baleadas, bean-stuffed tortillas popular in Honduras.\n\nEdwin Edgardo Rivera, 32, a bartender and clothing store employee in Honduras, was among those seeking a new life in Mexico.\n\nHe said he fled Honduras after receiving death threats from a gang angered by his refusal to help them collect extortion payments.\n\nHe initially thought of heading to the United States. \u201cBut it\u2019s very tough,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because Mexico, under U.S. pressure, is detaining and deporting many more unauthorized migrants.\n\n\u201cI saw all the extra military and police,\u201d he said. So he changed plans.\n\nFor now, anyway.\n\n\u201cOf course, if I can go north, I will,\u201d he confided with a laugh.\n\n\n\nEdwin Edgardo Rivera, 32, waits with fellow Honduran Mabel Portillo, 35, outside the office of Mexico\u2019s refugee commission in Tapachula. (Mary Beth Sheridan/The Washington Post)\n\nThe spike in asylum applications has nearly crushed Mexico\u2019s tiny, cash-strapped refugee commission. Its 2019 budget was slashed 20 percent, to $1.2 million, under a sweeping austerity program introduced by President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador.\n\nCOMAR is doing its best, said Andr\u00e9s Ram\u00edrez, head of the refu\u00adgee commission \u2014 but \u201cwe are always on the edge, almost collapsing.\u201d\n\nWith only 48 officials nationwide authorized to sign off on asylum approvals, the commission managed to process just 5,700 of nearly 30,000 applications last year.\n\n[Unauthorized immigrants face public backlash in Mexico, survey finds]\n\nUNHCR has stepped up its assistance, lending over 100 contractors to COMAR. Mexico\u2019s government also recently agreed to provide more staff.\n\nBut the number of applicants is expected to continue climbing as the U.S. government takes measures to discourage asylum seekers from arriving. Under a program known as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security has returned tens of thousands of asylum applicants to violence-plagued Mexican border cities to await hearings scheduled weeks or months later.\n\nAnother measure is the recently signed safe third country agreement with Guatemala. If implemented, it could force thousands of asylum seekers who crossed the country to go back there.\n\nSelee predicted those policies will have wide-ranging effects.\n\n\u201cThe more that Central Americans can\u2019t get to the United States, we\u2019re going to see numbers going up\u201d in other nations, including Costa Rica and Panama, he said.\n\nThe Trump administration says many asylum applications are bogus, filed by poor, job-seeking migrants who invent stories of persecution to improve their chances of being accepted. Officials say legitimate asylum seekers should seek refu\u00adge in the first country they are safe \u2014 not travel thousands of miles farther to the United States.\n\n\u201cThe asylum program is a scam,\u201d Trump said in April.\n\n[A 19-year-old Salvadoran woman wanted to reunite with her father in California. She was shot dead in Mexico.]\n\nIn Mexico, some applicants are clearly fleeing low-paying work or dire agricultural conditions \u2014 not repression. But many of the claims are seen as legitimate.\n\nMexico granted more than half of asylum petitions last year. The country recently made it easier for its two biggest groups of applicants \u2014 Hondurans and Salvadorans \u2014 to gain refugee status.\n\nUnder traditional asylum law, they\u2019d have to show they faced persecution for reasons such as their race, religion or political beliefs. Now, Ram\u00edrez said, they need only demonstrate that they\u2019re escaping countries with generalized violence or massive violations of human rights.\n\nIt\u2019s a broader definition of who is a refugee, drawn from a regional accord known as the Cartagena Declaration. The move reflects countries\u2019 struggles to address nontraditional crises, such as the tightening grip of organized crime groups in Central America.\n\n\u201cIn many of the conflicts around the world, where people are fleeing violence, it\u2019s not because of persecution by the state, but because the state can\u2019t protect people,\u201d Selee said.\n\n\n\nMigrants line up outside the Mexican refugee office in Tapachula. (Mary Beth Sheridan/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the Northern Triangle of Central America, violence is so widespread \u2014 and gang rule so pervasive \u2014 that many people don\u2019t even realize they might qualify for refugee status, said Kristin Riis Halvorsen, the UNHCR representative in Tapachula.\n\nIn initial interviews, she said, they often say they\u2019re leaving their countries for a better job. But on further questioning, they speak of threats and danger.\n\nThey suffer \u201can acute level of stress,\u201d she said. And then: \u201cThere\u2019s one thing that finally makes them leave.\u201d\n\n[Chief of U.S. asylum office reassigned as White House pushes for tighter immigration controls]\n\nFor Iris, a single mother, that one thing was a gang\u2019s demand for $200 a month. She had already changed neighborhoods once to escape threats from another gang, she said. And she was worried about layoffs at her employer, a shrimp-exporting company in southern Honduras.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have enough\u201d to give the extortioners, she said. \u201cThey said I\u2019d pay with my life, and the lives of my children.\u201d\n\nShe left her four older children with her mother in another part of the country and fled north with her son.\n\nSeeking asylum in Mexico has hardly been easy. Two months into the process, Iris still doesn\u2019t have a work permit. She and her son sleep at an overcrowded migrant shelter in Tapachula, or in a park.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve suffered a lot, especially being with my child,\u201d she said.\n\nHer son, in shorts and Captain America sneakers, climbed into her lap and smiled. He thrust forward his arm, covered in tiny bumps, for her to see.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the heat,\u201d his mother said.\n\n[Immigration officials partner with Panama to boost screening of migrants passing through to U.S.]\n\nAsylum seekers in Mexico are required to remain in the region where they\u2019ve filed their applications until they receive a decision. Most are concentrated in Chiapas, the country\u2019s poorest state, just across the border from Guatemala.\n\n\u201cEvery day, more families are arriving,\u201d said Salva Lacruz, coordinator of the Fray Mat\u00edas de C\u00f3rdova human-rights organization. \u201cToday, a Salvadoran or Honduran is ready to try and rebuild their lives in Mexico.\u201d\n\nBut the situation is worse for citizens from Cuba, Haiti, South Asia and Africa, he said. Many arrived in southern Mexico planning to get a document that gives unauthorized migrants 20 days to leave the country \u2014 enough time to reach the U.S. border. In an abrupt change, Mexican authorities in July started to only allow such migrants to depart via Guatemalan border.\n\nAn increasing number of such foreigners are effectively trapped in Tapachula, with little money and no desire to stay in Mexico.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Honduras and El Salvador, the situation has dramatic overtones. But with these people, there are overtones of tragedy and a brutal humanitarian crisis,\u201d said Lacruz. \u201cThey have no options.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nU.S. seeks deal to send asylum seekers from Africa and Asia to Panama\n\nTrump officials tighten asylum rules, enlist foreign nations to deter migration\n\nImmigration lawyers say Justice Dept. ruling could undercut thousands of asylum cases\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Latin American countries are seeing bigger increases in asylum petitions than the United States.", "authors": ["Mary Beth Sheridan", "Correspondent Covering Mexico", "Central America", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AeGCeMppVu4SUre7IESLJRMIu3M=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TB2QNJWPFMI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
