Rugby World Cup team of round three 1/16 Team of round three From Scotland's demolition of Samoa to France's narrow escape against Tonga, who makes the team of round three? AFP via Getty Images 2/16 1. James Slipper (Australia) Ninety-three Tests had come and gone for the Wallabies loosehead, but it was 94th-time lucky for the Queensland-born prop as he finally scored his first international try in Australia\u2019s 45-10 victory over Uruguay. Getty Images 3/16 2. Mbongeni Mbonambi (South Africa) Mbonambi was excellent at the lineout, finding his jumper on every occasion, but it was his work around the pitch that really stood out in the win over Italy as he bagged himself a try in the process. PA 4/16 3. Angus Ta\u2019avao (New Zealand) The rookie All Blacks prop was thrust into the contest against Namibia early when his team were struggling to break down the African side following Nepo Laulala\u2019s yellow card, but not only did he settle straight into the match, he immediately bagged himself a try that convinced Steve Hansen to leave him on for the rest of the match. Getty Images 5/16 4. Wimpie van der Walt (Japan) The uniquely-named lock led Japan\u2019s defensive charge against Samoa and was dominant in the aerial battle with a 100 per cent lineout effort alongside James Moore, which was made all the more impressive as he didn\u2019t start either of their opening matches. AFP via Getty Images 6/16 5. Sam Whitelock (New Zealand) Captained New Zealand in the absence of Kieran Read and led by example. Whitelock bagged a try himself, didn\u2019t panic when New Zealand were clawed back in the first half and contributed well with the ball in hand. His aggression in kicking for the corner early on paid off with a 71-point return. EPA 7/16 6. Rhys Ruddock (Ireland) Ireland may have been criticised for a drab performance in their victory over Russia, but Ruddock proved the silver lining with a man-of-the-match display that could thrust him into the side for the big contests. AFP via Getty Images 8/16 7. Sam Underhill (England) Another flanker named man of the match, Underhill was England\u2019s defensive heartbeat against Argentina, but also an emphatic carrier who helped set up George Ford\u2019s bonus point-clinching try. PA 9/16 8. Kazuki Himeno (Japan) The Japanese No 8 was one of their top performers against Samoa, carrying well and showing a deft touch with his ability to offload from the tackle. Earmarked as a real star of Japanese rugby, he looks to have real captaincy potential. AFP via Getty Images 10/16 9. Frank Lomani (Fiji) A livewire showing as the beating heart of a Flying Fijian side back at full strength and firing on all cylinders. Scored a try himself and delivered the quick ball that the Pacific Islanders crave to play their unique brand of rugby. AP 11/16 10. Jordie Barrett (New Zealand) Stepped out of the shadow of older brother Beauden to play a starring role in the demolition of Namibia. Scored a try himself but it was the in which he created Anton Lienert-Brown\u2019s score that really stood out, combining power, vision, passing ability and athletic determination to send the centre over. Getty Images 12/16 11. Semi Radradra (Fiji) The star of the side this week. When Radradra is playing his best rugby he is simply unstoppable, and so he proved last week. The Bordeaux back scored twice against Georgia and led pretty much every attacking stats list as the European side failed to shackle is delightful talent. AP 13/16 12. Anton Lienert-Brown (New Zealand) His form is keeping Sonny Bill Williams out of the Test side when New Zealand play their crunch fixtures, but on the weekend\u2019s evidence it was easy to see why. Two tries, the first an eye-catching mazy run from halfway, secures him the No 12 shirt this week, and probably for the All Blacks in the quarter-finals. Getty Images 14/16 13. Timothy Lafaele (Japan) Kicked off the performance against Samoa with their first try, starring with teammate Kotaro Matsushima to tear the Pacific Islanders apart early on and pave the way to their bonus-point victory. AFP via Getty Images 15/16 14. Cheslin Kolbe (South Africa) How do you stop him? The answer is yet to be found, with Kolbe\u2019s low centre of gravity, stunning footwork and Habana-like pace leaving team after team in knots \u2013 this time Italy \u2013 with two tries to kick-start his tally at this World Cup. AFP via Getty Images 16/16 15. Elliot Daly (England) Possibly his best performance for England in the No 15 shirt to date, Daly linked up superbly with Jonny May \u2013 who is hard done by not to make the side this week \u2013 and Anthony Watson in what was a scintillating first half for the English back three.

We\u2019d like to be playing a bit better in some regards at times, but hopefully we can put that performance out there on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very self-critical in terms of our performances and obviously after the Japan game we would have liked to have done things differently.\n\n\u201cBut we knew how good a team Japan were, so we always knew that would happen if we didn\u2019t play well, and it did happen.\n\n\u201cSo I think looking at the Scotland game last night, Japan were excellent again. They have been through the whole tournament.\n\n\u201cThey were clinical with the ball, every time Scotland gave them the ball they seemed to hold it for 20 or 30 phases.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty impressive, so I\u2019m sure they will go on and really worry South Africa.\u201d\n\nIreland\u2019s failure to launch past a World Cup quarter-final has become a millstone around the team\u2019s neck.\n\nNow Kiwi boss Schmidt has the chance for another history-making achievement, should he guide Ireland past his homeland and into a maiden World Cup semi-final.\n\nIreland lost 22-10 to Wales in the 2011 quarter-finals, before Schmidt\u2019s injury-ravaged men were thumped 43-20 by Argentina in Cardiff four years ago.\n\nSexton hopes Ireland\u2019s defeat to Japan will prove their main aberration for this competition then, especially as Schmidt\u2019s side this time approach the knockout phases with a clean bill of health.\n\nIn 2015, Ireland faced Argentina without Sexton, captain Paul O\u2019Connell, back-row stalwarts Sean O\u2019Brien and Peter O\u2019Mahony \u2013 and further backline talents Jared Payne and Tommy Bowe.\n\nBundee Aki faces a disciplinary hearing on Monday night and could be ruled out for the remainder of the tournament through suspension after his red card against Samoa.\n\nBut beyond that Ireland have everyone battling for selection, leaving Sexton hopeful of yet more history this weekend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that having lost a pool game that we\u2019ve got that quarter-final performance out of our system that we\u2019ve had in other tournaments,\u201d said Sexton.\n\n\u201cThe way we played against Japan was probably very similar to the way we played against Wales and Argentina in the last two tournaments.\n\n\u201cThe difference now is we\u2019re not favourites going into this quarter-final whereas we were in the last two.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re building nicely, we haven\u2019t hit our best performance yet and we need to get close to that to get the right result on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt makes a big difference having everyone fit, even just for the quality of training.\n\n\u201cI remember that Argentina week. We had guys like (analyst) Vinny (Hammond) running against us, and it wasn\u2019t the best quality opposition, physically and personally!\n\n\u201cBut this week we have everyone fit, we\u2019ve two good sides for training, so we can make the most of it.\"\n\nPA", "description": "Johnny Sexton has questioned the \u201cstrange\u201d negativity around Ireland\u2019s Rugby World Cup campaign, insisting Joe Schmidt\u2019s men are ready to peak for the All Blacks.
