(Photo: Clive Brunskill/ Getty Images)\n\nJames Middleton, brother of Duchess Kate of Cambridge, announced Sunday that he asked his French girlfriend, Alizee Thevenet, to marry him, and she said, \"Oui.\"\n\nThat means the remaining Middleton sibling is headed down the aisle; Kate, 38, the eldest of Carole and Michael Middleton's three children, married Prince William in 2011, and Pippa Middleton, 36, married financier James Matthews in 2017.\n\nJames Middleton, 32, announced the news on his Instagram page, including pictures and a short video clip.\n\n\"Our secret is out but we couldn\u2019t be happier to share the news,\" he captioned a selfie of the two, adding emojis for a champagne bottle and glasses.\n\nHis Instagram story featured a series of selfies of the two and a short video of them playing in and under water near a yacht.\n\n\"I asked @alizeethevenet a question the other day,\" the caption read.\n\nThere was no immediate word on when and where the wedding would take place.\n\nMiddleton stands out in public, thanks to his distinctive beard, which makes him look a bit like some of Prince William's royal ancestors, such as King George V.\n\nHis Instagram account is stuffed with pictures mostly of his five dogs, a pack of adorable Golden Retrievers, but in May, he posted a selfie snap with Thevenet.\n\n\"Sail away with me,\" he captioned the picture of the couple on a sailboat, wearing matching orange sweaters.\n\nMiddleton, who is close to both his sisters, has been seen with them often at family and charity events and at Wimbledon. He has dabbled in various businesses, with varying success, but in recent months, he's become something of a spokesman for dealing with depression and mental health issues.\n\nAfter Kate's wedding, he was catapulted into the media spotlight and found the pressure and scrutiny hard to handle. He has been open about his struggles, talking to Tatler about it in June and writing a candid column in the Daily Mail in January.\n\nHis royal in-laws, especially Prince William and Prince Harry, made mental health a focus of their charitable activities, hoping to reduce the stigma of mental illness and highlight the possibilities of treatment.\n\nMiddleton and Thevenet, 30, a financial analyst in London, have dated since the summer of 2018, according to the Daily Mail. That December, paparazzi spotted them together at a Christmas carol service to honor Pippa Middleton's late brother-in-law.\n\nIn January, they vacationed in St. Barts along with Pippa and Matthews. The Mail published an interview with Thevenet's father, Jean-Gabriel, who described them as \"deliriously happy.\"\n\n\"My daughter Alizee is very happy with James, they are very much in love,\" he told MailOnline.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/07/duchess-kate-brother-james-middleton-engaged-french-girlfriend/3898713002/", "description": "There's going to be a third Middleton wedding: James Middleton says he's engaged to his French financial analyst girlfriend, Alizee Thevenet.", "authors": ["Maria Puente", "Published P.M.
