He's trying to photograph every species, every animal, bird, fish, reptile and insect, in captivity. Sartore sides with scientists who estimate half the species alive today could be extinct by the end of this century. So he travels to zoos around the world to take pictures of what we're losing and to ignite conservation efforts to prevent extinctions. He calls his project: The Photo Ark.\n\n\"Emotion. That's what you look for in any in any great photograph.\"\n\nOn this ark, the animals go in one by one\n\nTo catch Joel Sartore in action, we flew halfway around the world to the Philippines, home to hundreds of unique species.\n\nBill Whitaker: Flew 20 hours to get here. And you came all this way to take a picture of a Palawan Stink Badger?\n\nJoel Sartore: Absolutely. Absolutely. He's smaller than a skunk but smells worse.\n\nHe's part-badger, part-skunk and he fired a reeking rocket after he entered the photo cage.\n\nThe Palawan stink badger CBS News\n\nIt smelled so terrible that the next animal to leave the red carpet and head into the photo cage, a rare Palawan Binturong, took one whiff, smelled stink badger stink and backed out.\n\nSartore said he should have photographed the stink badger last, but the little stinker is a pungent prize.\n\nJoel Sartore: There's nobody else coming along to photograph a stink badger. I'm the only one. And that's the case for 90 percent of the species I photograph, maybe 95 percent. These are things that nobody will ever know existed if it weren't for the Photo Ark. If they could see how beautiful this thing is they would care.\n\nJoel cares so much he spends half the year traveling the world. We saw him work 12-hour days in stifling, humid, hundred degree heat.\n\nIt was tough for us just watching him build pop-up studios, switching between backdrops of black and white.\n\nBill Whitaker: Why did you decide to use either black or white backgrounds?\n\nJoel Sartore: There are no distractions in these pictures. It's just the animal and you. And that animal's often looking you in the eye.\n\nThat's when it all works. Here's what happened years ago when Joel tried to photograph a chimp. He spent more than an hour taping up the white background.\n\nMore than an hour, for this.\n\nAnimals can be frustrating and dangerous, like this fierce Luzon Warty Pig, found only on a few Philippine islands. Handlers had herded him into a makeshift photo pen. Joel got as close as he dared, lying in a trough usually used for pig waste.\n\n\"National Geographic\" photographer Joel Sartore CBS News\n\nBill Whitaker: The tusks are sharp. The hooves are sharp--\n\nJoel Sartore: Yeah. I, I you know what? I'm concentrating. I got a lot to do.\n\nBeyond the tusks and hooves, this pig packs a mean temper. You've heard the expression: when pigs fly? Watch...\n\nJoel Sartore: Like a cow jumping over the moon, except it was a pig. I've never had that happen, ever. We got our picture. We don't ever need to photograph this species again.\n\nBut then, there was Trixie, perhaps the world's sweetest orangutan. We met her not far from the mean-spirited pig at the Avilon Zoo outside Manila.\n\nThe key question: would Trixie move in front of the white background?\n\nJoel Sartore: Do You think she would want to stand over there? And get her picture.\n\nBill Whitaker: She's amazing.\n\nJoel Sartore: Awesome, look at that.\n\nEllen Sartore: Aw sweet girl.\n\nBill Whitaker: Covergirl.\n\nJoel Sartore: If she lays down to look at you, you get down with her. You just lay down on the ground and eye level. She was completely calm.\n\nSartore and correspondent Bill Whitaker with Trixie CBS News\n\nLater, Sartore showed us his favorites Trixie shots, at \"National Geographic\" headquarters in Washington.\n\nBill Whitaker: So what do you think she's thinking?\n\nJoel Sartore: I think she was just thinking, you know, \"Is there a banana in this somewhere for me? (laugh) A mango?\"\n\nJoel Sartore: I like the white one better I think. It's more direct. It's more like she's involved. She's a partner in the process.\n\nBill Whitaker: I put my hand out. I wasn't quite sure she was going to take it. But she did.\n\nJoel Sartore: Yeah, it's soft.\n\nBill Whitaker: And it was soft. Yeah, that was an amazing experience.\n\nBill Whitaker: What makes a great picture?\n\nJoel Sartore: Emotion. That's what you look for in any in any great photograph.\n\nBill Whitaker: What's emotion in an animal\u2014\n\nJoel Sartore: A moment. We're looking for the eyes. Humans are we're primates, and we're really really responsive to eyes. We're all about eye contact.\n\nBill Whitaker: But you shoot 'em like they're models.\n\nJoel Sartore: We do. Like they're going in for their high school senior portrait.\n\nSartore shoots birds in tents so they won't fly away. This White-Crowned Hornbill, posed like a preening pro. Completely different from Joel's first attempt to shoot this species, back in the states.\n\nJoel Sartore: So this lady, her name's Jen. What she didn't tell me is that bird is such a badass he attacks her when he goes in to feed him.\n\nJoel Sartore: So when I said, \"Can you put that bird in my tent?\" She went, \"Sure I can.\"\n\nThat's why he wanted to shoot a calm hornbill in the Philippines.\n\nOnce snake bitten, but not camera shy\n\nBut here the Red Rat Snake kept attacking.\n\nFortunately, he's not venomous, since he bit our cameraman Mark LaGanga.\n\nJoel Sartore: I enjoy seeing a 60 Minutes cameraman get bit instead of me.\n\nBut the next snake was extremely venomous.\n\nThe Palawan Spitting Cobra can blind you if it spits in your eye and it can spit ten feet. That's why Joel wore goggles. But watch how close he gets to this cobra.\n\nSartore shoots the Palawan spitting cobra CBS News\n\nBill Whitaker: I always thought when they had their hood out like that that meant danger.\n\nJoel Sartore: Well he's reacting to us. We're like skyscrapers to this guy. So he's gonna stand up and look as big as he can.\n\nIn zoos Sartore can shoot more than 20 species in one day. In the wild it could take several days to get one good shot. Now, with natural habitats vanishing, some species can only be found in zoos.\n\nJoel Sartore: A lot of 'em only exist in zoos. They have these captive breeding programs for some of the rarest animals in the world. So when people say well, they're down on zoos. Well they haven't seen a good zoo and they don't know the conservation effect of good zoos.\n\nSartore spent his first 16 years at \"National Geographic\" taking pictures in the field. He scored numerous magazine covers, and endured various hardships.\n\nJoel Sartore: Yeah. That's me. That's on Alaska's north slope. I wanted to show the insect load up there. And also I hadn't made a good picture in three days. And so the editors here will say, \"Joel, we can't publish your excuses.\"\n\nBill Whitaker: The mosquitoes though my god. That's incredible.\n\nJoel Sartore: Yeah. My feet itched for a long time.\n\nHe came up with the Photo Ark idea after his wife developed breast cancer.\n\nJoel Sartore: That's my son Cole, and my wife Kathy. She went on chemo for nine months. And I was grounded. I was home for a year. And so I was really worried she was not gonna make it. But we all made it through. She's fine today, it's been 13 years, which is great.\n\nBill Whitaker: Wonderful.\n\nJoel Sartore: It really does make you appreciate how limited our time is.\n\nBill Whitaker: So the cancer changed all of your lives.\n\nJoel Sartore: Yeah. And started the Photo Ark. It was a desperate, last-ditch effort to use my life for something that's worthwhile, something that could save nature.\n\nBill Whitaker: In the Bible, the ark saves all the creatures on Earth. Is that your goal?\n\nJoel Sartore: Exactly. Giddy up. You bet.\n\nBill Whitaker: What makes you think you can save them with a photo?\n\nJoel Sartore: We can reach more people now than ever. Because we can post to \"National Geographic,\" Instagram and Facebook and reach over 100 million people, and do it again and again and again.\n\nHis latest pictures are published periodically and they've appeared on the Empire State Building, and the Vatican.\n\nJoel Sartore: Yeah, the side of St Peter's Basilica. The Pope was sittin' there watchin' it, which was awesome.\n\nWe flew with Joel to the island of Negros. Here, vast forests were cut for timber, robbing wildlife of vital habitat.\n\nJoel Sartore: Now there's hardly any lowland forest left, less than 5 percent here.\n\nNegros has its own type of critically endangered warty pig. This mother was saved from a hunter's snare. In the zoo, she's helping to save her species.\n\nJoel Sartore: She's got her babies. And you see that bridle marking on her snout that's really definitive.\n\nBill Whitaker: Oh yeah, oh yeah, that's beautiful.\n\n\"At least my life'll be spent doing something that's hopefully mattered to the world\"\n\nJoel, who spends so much time away from home, brought his daughter Ellen on this trip.\n\nBill Whitaker: So what do you think of what he's doing?\n\nEllen Sartore: I think it's extraordinary, what you're doing.\n\nJoel Sartore: Really?\n\nEllen Sartore: I do.\n\nJoel Sartore: Aww. You're gonna make me cry.\n\nEllen Sartore: Don't cry. (laugh)\n\nJoel Sartore: I've never heard you say that. You do?\n\nEllen Sartore: Yeah.\n\nBill Whitaker: But he is gone all the time?\n\nEllen Sartore: He hasn't been to the last seven of my birthdays just because my birthday is in migration season. So he's\u2014\n\nBill Whitaker: Migration season? (laugh)\n\nJoel Sartore: It's true.\n\nBill Whitaker: So that's a birthday-buster.\n\nJoel Sartore: Yeah.\n\nThe next day Sartore showed us a beetle he had spotted. A species he hadn't shot before.\n\nBill Whitaker: So there's nothing too small for you huh?\n\nJoel Sartore: Nothing to small. If you can see it with your eyes. We'll photograph it.\n\nBill Whitaker: How big is this guy?\n\nJoel Sartore: Oh, that guy is the size of a grain of rice.\n\nBill Whitaker: Tiny.\n\nJoel Sartore: Yea tiny.\n\nBill Whitaker: So every animal fills up your frame?\n\nJoel Sartore: That's right.\n\nBill Whitaker: Small or large.\n\nJoel Sartore: He's as big as a polar bear.\n\nBill Whitaker: Why do you do that?\n\nJoel Sartore: Because it gives 'em all equal say, equal voice. The big, charismatic mammals get all the ink. They get all the press, the gorillas and the rhinos and the tigers. Nobody's thinkin' about these little guys. I am.\n\nSartore shot another little guy, believed to be the very last member of a now extinct species.\n\nJoel Sartore: That's the last Rabbs Fringe Limbed Frog.\n\nBill Whitaker: What's that like, knowing that this animal will not exist anymore shortly after you take the picture?\n\nJoel Sartore: Well does it make me sad? Sure. But does it inspire me to go out and keep workin' like I do? Absolutely.\n\nJoel Sartore: We put this together in my office. This just shows you what rodents can look like and what parrots look like. Biodiversity in-- in a glance. Just primates.\n\nBill Whitaker: Wow.\n\nJoel Sartore: And we've done a lot more since then. We can go out farther and farther and farther. Hundreds of species. Thousands of species. Just amphibians. There's so much diversity but you'd never know it. You'd never know it.\n\nBill Whitaker: So you've been doing this for how long now?\n\nJoel Sartore: 12 years.\n\nBill Whitaker: How many species have you photographed?\n\nJoel Sartore: 8,255 but who's counting?\n\nBill Whitaker: You're about halfway through. And you're how old now?\n\nJoel Sartore: 55, almost 56. Tick tick tick tick tick, just as loud as that 60 Minutes stopwatch baby.\n\nBill Whitaker: Time's running out.\n\nJoel Sartore: It is. But you know, at least my life'll be spent doing something that's hopefully mattered to the world.\n\nProduced by Robert Anderson and Aaron Weisz.", "description": "The \"National Geographic\" photographer shows 60 Minutes how his shots come together and why he started his Photo Ark project", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/10/14/a7404b76-b7da-4d01-9d6d-3f2e8406105d/thumbnail/1200x630/fd6f916866763dfbf6b507977372ee27/joelsartoremain.jpg"}
