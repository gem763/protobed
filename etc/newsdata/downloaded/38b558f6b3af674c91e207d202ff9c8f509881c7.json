Not that Fallen Order has any multiplayer, but other popular EA games \u2013 such as FIFA, Battlefield, and The Sims \u2013 will also be coming to Steam in the near future.\n\nEA left Steam in 2011 in order to start Origin, but while the service has seemed to work fine it\u2019s never evolved into a rival to Steam, despite selling games from other publishers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou will still need to have Origin installed on your PC to play EA games on Steam though, so it\u2019s presumably not going anywhere soon.\n\nEA Access, which has always been surprisingly good value, is becoming ever more popular though and will be the same price as on consoles and Origin, i.e. \u00a33.99 a month or \u00a319.99 a year.\n\nInterestingly, EA\u2019s reason for going back to Steam is concern over subscription fatigue, with the company choosing to focus on EA Access rather than Origin.\n\n\u2018Since the time we removed our games from Steam, there\u2019s been this dramatic increase in the number of gaming services, which you would think would be really good for players. But I think in many cases, it\u2019s the exact opposite. It creates more difficulty for players, and providing player choice \u2013 from my perspective and speaking on behalf of EA \u2013 is really critical\u2019, EA exec Mike Blank told GamesIndustry.biz.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an opportunity to make it possible for people to play where they want, to reduce that fragmentation and make it more frictionless\u2026 Reducing that fragmentation is really important. It\u2019s the most player-first thing we can do.\u2019\n\nWhen asked about Epic Games Store, Blank didn\u2019t rule the possibility out but instead said he is \u2018open to new partnerships\u2019.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order hands-on preview \u2013 judge it by its trailer, do not\n\nMORE: EA includes FIFA in first trial for Project Atlas cloud streaming service\n\nMORE: EA claim UK Parliament loot boxes are \u2018surprise mechanics\u2019 and \u2018quite fair\u2019", "description": "Starting next month you\u2019ll be able to buy EA games from Steam again, with EA Access set to appear on Valve\u2019s service next spring.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/steam-logo_1572366796.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
