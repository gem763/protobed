Did Kavanaugh allegedly consent to have his \u201cfriends,\u201d plural, \u201cpush his penis\u201d? If he did not consent, wouldn\u2019t that mean that both he and the female student were both victims of this alleged assault committed by the \u201cfriends\u201d?\n\nNational Review left a message with Stier\u2019s assistant asking whether he is claiming that Kavanaugh was a willing participant in this alleged assault. Stier\u2019s office has not replied. The same question was posed in an email to the communications director of Senator Chris Coons (D., Del.), who informed the FBI of Stier\u2019s accusation last year. Coons\u2019s office has not replied.\n\nNational Review has also asked a representative of Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s book publisher whether Stier is alleging that Kavanaugh was a willing participant in this assault and whether the authors have corroborated the allegation with anyone at the alleged party besides Stier. The representative of Penguin Random House, who had been communicative by email, has not replied to either question.", "description": "", "authors": ["John Mccormack", "Nationalreview.Com What-We-Still-Dont-Know-About-The-New-Kavanaugh-Allegation"], "top_image": ""}
