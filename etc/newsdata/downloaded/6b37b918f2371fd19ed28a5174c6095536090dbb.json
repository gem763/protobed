The Grande Halle de la Villette exhibition of 150 objects found in the tomb of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh is now France\u2019s most-visited exhibition ever, having attracted over 1.3 million visitors. Many of the objects on show \u2013 \u201cwonderful things\u201d, in Howard Carter\u2019s words, including mini-coffins, a gilded bed and a calcite vase \u2013 have left Egypt for the first time for the Treasures of the Pharaoh exhibition, which will move to London\u2019s Saatchi Gallery in November.\n\nThe exhibition\u2019s popularity echoes the wave of \u201cTut-mania\u201d that swept the west almost 100 years ago when Carter first discovered the boy-king\u2019s tomb. Suddenly everyone seemed interested in Egyptology, evident in the fashions, arts, culture and advertising of the time, and most enduringly in art-deco architecture such as the Chrysler building in New York \u2013 especially its distinctive elevator doors \u2013 and the Carreras Cigarette Factory in London, with its line of sleek black cats guarding the entrance. US president Herbert Hoover named his dog King Tut, and there were calls for the extension of the London Underground\u2019s Northern Line that linked Tooting and Camden Town to be named Tutancamden.\n\nThere had been a similar wave of interest in the 19th century following Napoleon\u2019s military campaign in Egypt and Syria, which included a group of scientists and other experts \u2013 one of whom discovered the Rosetta Stone during the trip.\n\nI can well understand this fascination; an Egyptian exhibition in London in 2010 transformed what became my novel The Weighing of the Heart. The book\u2019s narrator, Nick, is a young British man who steals a work of art from the study of his rich landladies on New York\u2019s Upper East Side. The stolen piece is an ancient Egyptian scene, and as the stress of the theft starts to work on Nick and his girlfriend Lydia, its imagery starts to come to life around them, although it\u2019s unclear whether this is really happening or is all in Nick\u2019s head.\n\nBut originally the artwork they steal wasn\u2019t an Ancient Egyptian scene at all; it was a piece of 1960s pop art. Not long after I had started working on the book I visited an exhibition at the British Museum called The Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead, about what the ancient Egyptians believed happened to you when you die, and had a moment of inspiration.\n\nThe Egyptians believed in a ceremony called \u201cthe weighing of the heart\u201d, similar in some ways to the Christian idea of St Peter standing at the gates of Heaven, deciding whether or not you have lived a worthy enough life to come in. In the Egyptian version, Anubis, the god of embalming, presides over a set of scales with the heart of the dead person on one side and a feather on the other. If the heart is in balance with the feather, you go to Heaven, which the Egyptians called the Field of Reeds. But if your heart is heavier than the feather, you get eaten by a the Devourer, a creature with the head of a crocodile, the body of a lion and the back legs of a hippopotamus.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An ancient artefact is inspected by British Museum staff in 1972.

One thing they were afraid of was that the heart would try to grass you up during this ceremony \u2013 that it would speak up and reveal your worst sins to Anubis. You could prevent this from happening by keeping hold of a little \u201cheart scarab\u201d.\n\nI was spellbound by this ornate mythology. I loved the way it was so familiar in its overall concept but so strange in its details. And I suddenly realised that the painting Nick and Lydia should steal should be an image of this ceremony, the weighing of the heart. It was fitting because the book is essentially about guilt and innocence; it\u2019s about you weighing up as a reader how much you trust Nick as a narrator, and it\u2019s about the people around him weighing up how much they trust him. I hope that I found a way to knit all that imagery into the book effectively.\n\nOnce I\u2019d settled on this, there was a strange coincidence \u2013 only slightly less dramatic than the so-called \u201ccurse of Tutankhamun\u201d, the mysterious deaths of a number of people connected with the pharaoh\u2019s tomb. When looking for someone to create the book\u2019s artwork, I discovered an artist named James Puttnam who used to work for the British Museum and had become quite well-known for his reproductions of ancient Egyptian scenes. I ended up basing my artist, Edward Hazlemere, partially on him.\n\nAnd at one point in The Weighing of the Heart Nick recalls a school trip to the British Museum, suggesting he may have stolen one of protective heart scarabs from there. I wanted to get the details right, so I looked through the British Museum\u2019s collection of scarabs on their website and identified the one that best fitted the bill. I went to the museum to take a look at it in person. But when I got there and found the case where this scarab was supposed to be, the space for it was empty. Instead of the object itself there was just a note on the wall that said: \u201cHeart scarab (lost)\u201d. Just like in my book, the scarab was gone.\n\nI\u2019ll be at the Treasures of the Pharaoh exhibition when it arrives in London to see if the one buried with Tutankhamun has fared any better.", "description": "Paris\u2019s Tutankhamun exhibition is a record-breaking hit \u2013 but scarabs, pharaohs and man-eating monsters have been thrilling us for centuries", "authors": ["Paul Owen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/707e8319d13174ceef875113cfff37c375fb83e2/0_72_4272_2563/master/4272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9dca5021c0c1074ae6d89808c8c18a9d"}
