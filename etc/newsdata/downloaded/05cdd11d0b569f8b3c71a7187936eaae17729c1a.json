Instead, the seven men and three women took turns displaying why they are all probably unelectable.\n\nStart with Joe Biden\u2019s incoherence. The nominal front-runner, the former vice president had a 40-year reputation for never shutting up. Now he can\u2019t manage to finish a sentence without interrupting himself.\n\nNearly all his efforts to make a point were swamped by a sudden change of direction mid-sentence, and then another change a few words later as a random thought popped into his head and out his mouth. None of his rivals needed to interrupt him \u2014 he did it to himself.\n\nMost of the time I had no idea what he was trying to say, let alone what he actually said. I veered between feeling sorry for him and expecting the AFLAC duck to come out on stage and shake its head in bewilderment.\n\nI have said all along that I don\u2019t believe Biden will be the nominee, and last night left me more certain than ever. He\u2019s not capable of going the distance in the primaries and then taking on Trump.\n\nBiden\u2019s poor performance and the failure of any others to have a breakout night should have been good news for Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She has placed second in most recent polls, but Warren failed to take advantage of the opening Biden presented and shied away from attacking him directly.\n\nInstead, she mostly stayed in her comfort zone, which meant issuing radical calls for overthrowing everything and giving Washington more power over virtually all aspects of American life. Her sweeping assertions reminded me of a recent conversation with a veteran New York Dem.\n\nHe said Warren was the only one of his party\u2019s candidates he would have trouble supporting against Trump, and that was because of her radicalism.\n\nHe then allowed himself a chuckle and added: \u201cShe\u2019ll probably get the nomination and lose 50 states.\u201d\n\nTo judge from last night, both things remain possible. Her double-edged sword was on full display.\n\nSometimes she did cut through the fog to deliver clear policy ideas in a manner that was concise. But it also became clear that, no matter the topic, her response always followed the same formula. Namely, that the whole system must be demolished because \u201cmoney\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d are to blame for everything that ails America.\n\nHealth care, the economy, taxes, climate issues, fossil fuels, trade, blah blah blah \u2014 all of it is evil and it all has the same root to her.\n\nBeyond her one-size-fits-all answer, I didn\u2019t hear her saying a single thing about America that she likes. She\u2019s so invested in smashing everything and starting over that, unless she can become more of a happy warrior, she very well could suffer a historic thumping in a general election.\n\nThe other top-tier candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders, came in with his usual angry rant and only moderated his voice near the end, when he seemed to grow tired of shouting. It\u2019s hard to imagine that he either gained or lost anything from the evening. He came with a cult following and left with a cult following.\n\nAll of which means the fireworks in Houston only served to cement the notion that Dems are still far from being settled on the path and the person to take them to the White House.\n\nThe conclusion was underscored by the fact that the debate came on the same day that the House judiciary panel produced a muddled message about whether it intends to try to impeach the president or just keep harassing him. The confusion illustrates how united Dems are against Trump, and yet how divided they are about how to go about beating him.\n\nImpeach him first, or not at all? Go with an unexciting and unpredictable Biden, or take a flyer on Warren or Sanders, whose ideas are from another planet?\n\nFor now, there don\u2019t seem to be any other options.\n\nTrump, of course, can be counted on to help the Dems with blunders of his own and he remains fully capable of losing an election he should win. But that can only happen if the Dems meet the threshold tests of finding a candidate and a platform that can energize the party\u2019s base and also appeal to the working-class voters who abandoned Hillary Clinton in 2016 and gave the White House to Trump.\n\nThe nomination voting begins in February, which gives the party nearly five months to get its act together. If Thursday was any indication, five years wouldn\u2019t be enough time.", "description": "The Democrats\u2019 third presidential debate was a long-winded, platitude-filled disaster where no single candidate could claim a clear victory.", "authors": ["Michael Goodwin", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/joe-biden-2-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
