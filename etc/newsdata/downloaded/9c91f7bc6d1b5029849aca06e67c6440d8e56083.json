All of the money will be used to refinance existing debt.\n\nPemex has also launched a tender offer to buy back up to $5 billion in bonds with due dates between 2020 and 2023 using a capital injection from the Mexican government, and is making an exchange offer of new notes to replace other short-term maturities.\n\nPemex, the world\u2019s most indebted oil company, with more than $104 billion in debt in the second quarter, is on the brink of losing its investment grade.\n\nFitch Ratings cut Pemex\u2019s debt to speculative in June, and Moody\u2019s Investors Service has the company at its lowest investment grade with a negative outlook.\n\nS&P Global Ratings has a negative outlook on Pemex, but rates the company several notches higher, at the same level as the sovereign, given the government\u2019s \u201calmost certain likelihood of extraordinary support for Pemex\u201d in the event of financial distress.\n\n\u201cThe company has a critical role for the Mexican government, both economically and for the execution of the government\u2019s energy policy,\u201d S&P said Tuesday.\n\nThe administration of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has reiterated its support for Pemex with capital injections and tax breaks.\n\nSince taking office in December, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has increased investment in Pemex in an effort to turn around a 15-year decline in output that saw the company\u2019s crude oil production fall to 1.67 million barrels a day at present from 3.4 million in 2004. But at the same time, he has put a freeze on new oil block auctions for private companies, saying he\u2019s waiting to see results from contracts already awarded, and he\u2019s pressing ahead with construction of a controversial $8 billion oil refinery.\n\nWhile welcoming the efforts to increase output and oil reserves at Pemex, investors and analysts think the company needs to invest much more to meet its targets. Many were disappointed that the company\u2019s business plan unveiled in July excluded more joint ventures with private companies that would allow it to share the investment burden in developing its reserves.\n\nWrite to Anthony Harrup at anthony.harrup@wsj.com", "description": "Pemex said the refinancing operation is the largest in its history, and that all of the money will be used to refinance existing debt.
