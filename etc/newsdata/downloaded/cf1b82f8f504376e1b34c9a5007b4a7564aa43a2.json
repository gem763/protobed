Both men were African-American. Buck is white.\n\nAmster, following the second death, told the Los Angeles Times in an article published in March that his client had a \u201cheart of gold\u201d and brought troubled people into his home to offer them help.\n\n\u2018TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE\u2019\n\n\u201cStill not deterred despite two deaths in his apartment, Buck persisted in his malevolent behavior,\u201d prosecutors said in the court papers, in which they requested his bail amount remain at $4 million.\n\nProsecutors said that on Sept. 11, Buck injected methamphetamine into a 37-year-old man identified as Joe Doe, who overdosed but survived after fleeing the apartment. At one point, Buck tried to stop the man from getting help, they said.\n\nBuck was charged on Tuesday with one felony count each of battery causing serious injury, administering methamphetamine and maintaining a drug house.\n\nBuck \u201cpreys on men made vulnerable by addiction and homelessness\u201d and he \u201cmanipulates his victims into participating in his sexual fetishes,\u201d prosecutors said in court papers.\n\n\u201cI remain deeply concerned for the safety of people whose life circumstances may make them more vulnerable to criminal predators,\u201d Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Representative Karen Bass, a Democrat from California, said in a statement that Buck\u2019s arrest was \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d because nothing was done in the immediate aftermath of the deaths of two black men at his home.\n\n\u201cThe inaction in response had a message that was loud and clear: Black gay lives obviously didn\u2019t matter,\u201d Bass said.\n\nBuck, if convicted of the charges against him, faces a possible maximum sentence of five years and eight months in state prison.", "description": "Prominent California Democratic Party donor Edward Buck has been charged with operating a drug den after injecting a man with methamphetamine in his West Hollywood home where two other men previously died of apparent overdoses, prosecutors said.", "authors": ["Alex Dobuzinskis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
