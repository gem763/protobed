A news conference will be held in Frankfurt later today.\n\nIn Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 rose by 0.5%, having been flat or negative for much of Thursday's trading, and the euro slipped 0.5% against the U.S. dollar.\n\n\"The slowdown in the eurozone is not about domestic forces but global trade more generally,\" said David Owen, chief European economist at Jefferies.\n\nGovernment bond yields, which had climbed in recent days, were broadly down across Europe. Germany's 10-year bund fell to minus 0.634%.\n\nFutures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.3%. The contracts don't necessarily predict movements after the opening bell.\n\nThe level of asset purchases, with market expectations set around EUR30 billion a month, was lower than some had hoped. However, Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said it might cheer markets if outgoing ECB President Mario Draghi is seen to have left space for further action by his successor, Christine Lagarde.\n\n\"It will be positive for the market if investors believe that Lagarde still has room for maneuver when she comes in,\" Mr. Gimber said. That room could also include further interest-rate cuts, he said.\n\nStocks in Asia got a boost after the White House delayed extra tariffs on Chinese imports. The Shanghai Composite and Japan's Nikkei both closed up 0.8%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was an outlier, slipping 0.3%.\n\nWith trade talks due to be held in Washington next month between the U.S. and China, President Trump postponed new tariffs on $250 billion in goods that were due to take effect on Oct. 1 by two weeks, a conciliatory gesture that could point to easing tensions.\n\nThe offshore yuan was up 0.4% against the U.S. dollar. The yuan's relative weakness has been a source of tension between the countries in recent weeks, with the U.S. accusing China of currency manipulation after a sharp depreciation in the yuan.\n\nThe U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yield edged down to 1.689%, from 1.733% on Wednesday, after posting three straight days of gains. Bond prices fall as yields rise.\n\nInflation data from the U.S., expected later Thursday, could have an impact on Federal Reserve decision makers ahead of their meeting next week. Recent updates to the consumer-price index from the Labor Department suggested inflation might be making a comeback.\n\nWith strong wage growth reported last month, prices may continue to rebound after a weak start to the year. Excluding volatile sectors like fuel and food, so-called core CPI should have risen 0.2% in August, economists expect.\n\nFigures will also be released on the number of weekly U.S. jobless claims, with an expectation of 216,000, compared with last week's 217,000.\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude dropped 1.2% to $60.07 a barrel. Gold rose 0.5%, extending its climb that followed Mr. Trump's call for the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates to zero. Lower interest rates tend to support the price of the haven metal by making it more competitive with yield-bearing assets like bonds.\n\nWrite to Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 12, 2019 08:45 ET (12:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
