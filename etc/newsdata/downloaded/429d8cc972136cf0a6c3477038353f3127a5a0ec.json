(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nRapidly spreading wildfires have erupted amid \u201cextremely critical\u201d fire danger in parts of California, with conditions likely to escalate risks to Southern California, including the Los Angeles area, through Friday.\n\nIn Northern California, the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County, about 75 miles north of San Francisco, rapidly expanded in size early Thursday morning, torching 10,000 acres just four hours after it was first reported. A fed-flag warning is in effect for much of the San Francisco Bay area through 4 p.m. Thursday as high offshore winds of up to 60 mph in some locations, combined with extremely dry air, create ideal conditions for rapidly spreading wildfires. The offshore winds in Northern California are forecast to slacken as the day goes on, potentially giving firefighters a window to make gains on that blaze and any others that erupt during the day.\n\n[Live coverage of the Kincaid Fire]\n\nHowever, relative humidity is not expected to recover much overnight, which could make wildfires more difficult to contain.\n\nTinderbox conditions\n\nThe wildfire threat in Southern California will ramp up throughout the day Thursday, with the National Weather Service forecast office in Los Angeles warning of \u201can environment ripe for large and dangerous fire growth, especially Thursday and Friday.\u201d Forecasters are warning of \u201cextreme fire behavior\" for any blazes that erupt through Friday.\n\nThe NWS is predicting \u201cisolated gusts to 75 mph below passes and canyons\u201d with relative humidities \u201caround 5 percent\u201d in parts of Ventura and Los Angeles Counties through Friday.\n\n\u201cThis has all the ingredients of a dangerous fire weather scenario,\u201d wrote the office, calling it \u201csimilar to or worse than the recent Oct. 10-11 event that produced the Saddleridge Fire.\u201d They urged extreme caution, mentioning that actions as simple as \u201cdragging towing chains\u201d can create the sparks that metastasize into a wildfire.\n\nThe dry air is also allowing the ground to bake and temperatures to skyrocket. Los Angeles could hit 95 degrees Thursday, encouraging the evaporation of any remaining moisture in the plants, leading to more dried-out vegetation and littering the ground with fuel to nourish the next big blaze.\n\nOminously, forecasters and firefighters are eyeing a second round of \u201ceven stronger\u201d offshore Santa Ana winds is set to plague much of California this weekend, with \u201cpockets of critical fire weather\u201d likely per the National Weather Service.\n\nThe Kincade Fire\n\n2:27 am | GOES-17 satellite Fire Temperature imagery of the #KincadeFire.

It\u2019s quickly swallowed surrounding areas in flames, expanding at an average rate of a football field every two seconds \u2014 or 30 football fields each minute during a four-hour period early Thursday. Winds in the vicinity of the fire gusted as high as 76 mph, propelling the flames and spreading embers far ahead of the fire front.\n\nEvacuations have been ordered in parts of Sonoma County, including the community of Geyserville.\n\n[Fast-moving wildfire ignites in Northern California wine country, prompting evacuations]\n\nThe fire is surging south, and has reportedly crossed Highway 128. Some of the smoke could cloud Bay Area skies on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Kincade Fire comes two years after the deadly Tubbs Fire devastated nearby Santa Rosa. At least 22 people died, and more than 5,600 homes and buildings were destroyed in that blaze, which occurred in similar weather conditions.\n\nHere's a look at peak winds speeds so far.

(WeatherBell.com)\n\nFollowing a brief improvement late Friday into Saturday, a renewed threat of high fire danger is in the cards Saturday evening through Monday. The National Weather Service is referring to this as an \u201ceven stronger wind event,\u201d with drier air as well, and the risk could encompass everywhere from the forests of the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the urban sprawl of Southern California.\n\nWind gusts in excess of 60 mph are possible in the higher terrain and foothills throughout much of Northern and Central California, with relative humidity dropping as low as 3 percent.\n\nPreemptive blackouts and a changing climate\n\n\n\nPacific Gas & Electric employees work in the PG&E Emergency Operations Center in San Francisco earlier this month. (Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\nMeanwhile, California\u2019s electrical providers have instituted the second round of \u201cpublic safety power shutoffs\u201d in two weeks to reduce the risk of sparking a blaze when dangerous fire weather is present. Pacific Gas and Electric cut service to more than 182,000 customers, beginning Wednesday in the Sierra foothills and North Bay and early Thursday morning in San Mateo and Kern Counties. \u201cFor planning purposes, we suggest customers prepare for multiple-day outages,\u201d PG&E wrote on its website. Southern California Edison, the state\u2019s other major provider of electricity to more than 14 million people, has shut off power to 15,000 so far. Another 286,000 are \u201cunder [public safety power shutoff] consideration.\u201d\n\nAdditional shutoffs may become warranted with the second event over the weekend.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s preemptive power cuts are a new and extreme way of adapting to an environment that scientists say is more conducive to large wildfires and longer fire seasons. This is largely due to a combination of climate change and land use shifts.\n\nThe ongoing wildfires come on the heels of the devastating 2017 and 2018 California fire seasons, which featured the largest, most destructive, and deadliest blazes on record. The Camp Fire, for example, occurred nearly one year ago, killing 88 and destroying much of the town of Paradise. An investigation concluded that the fire began from a spark generated by a Pacific Gas & Electric power line.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a clear pattern toward larger, more frequent and destructive blazes. And, according to CalFire, \u201cclimate change is considered a key driver of this trend.\" Population growth and the increase in homes and businesses located near lands that typically burn, known as the wildland-urban interface, are also escalating the risk of and damage from wildfires in the Golden State.\n\n\u201cWarmer spring and summer temperatures, reduced snowpack, and earlier spring snowmelt create longer and more intense dry seasons that increase moisture stress on vegetation and make forests more susceptible to severe wildfire,\" the agency wrote. \u201cThe length of fire season is estimated to have increased by 75 days across the Sierras and seems to correspond with an increase in the extent of forest fires across the state.\u201d\n\nPartly because of its experience with wildfires, California has established the most ambitious climate policy targets in the country, but the consequences of global warming are already here, and increasingly obvious.\n\nOne of the most robust conclusions of climate change research is that wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent and severe in large parts of the American West as the climate warms, particularly in California. This is taking place as summers become hotter and drier and precipitation becomes more variable in the winter, with jarring shifts from drought to flood and back again becoming the norm.\n\nFor example, the National Climate Assessment, an authoritative report published by the Trump administration in 2017, showed that the cumulative forest area burned by wildfires in the Southwest between 1984 and 2015 doubled because of climate-change-related factors.\n\nIn an indication that an uptick in large wildfires is already occurring in California, 15 of the top 20 largest wildfires in state history have occurred since the year 2000.\n\nComputer model projections show huge increases in wildfire frequency and size in California as well as other parts of the Southwest if greenhouse gas emissions continue largely unabated.\n\nKim Bellware contributed to this story.", "description": "Amid gusty and dry offshore winds in California, wildfires are erupting and spreading rapidly.", "authors": ["Matthew Cappucci", "Meteorologist", "Capital Weather Gang", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "October At Pm", "Matthew Cappucci Is A Meteorologist For Capital Weather Gang.
