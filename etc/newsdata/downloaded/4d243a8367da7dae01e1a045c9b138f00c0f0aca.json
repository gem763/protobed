The 150-liter stainless steel tank normally stores tap water that passes through a water purifier for daily use, but in the event of an earthquake, a valve closes automatically, preventing unclean water from entering the tank, the company said.\n\n\"I want to be ready before a disaster strikes and I would like to contribute to building a disaster-resilient community,\" said Shigeyuki Toguchi, president of the startup, who was involved in electrical restoration work following the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake that devastated Kobe and its vicinity in 1995.\n\nToguchi, who is a certified disaster response specialist, is thinking of selling the tanks, priced at around 600,000 yen, in the Kansai region at first, eventually hoping to expand across the country.\n\nAnother startup in Yokohama is selling an oral hygiene product that does not require water for rinsing.\n\nTrife Inc's OralPeace hypoallergenic and safe-to-swallow products, made from plant-derived ingredients, are handy for cleaning teeth during a disaster. They come in gel and spray form, priced at 1,320 yen and 1,100 yen, respectively.\n\nThe products were originally developed for people who have trouble gargling, such as the elderly and people with disabilities, but are now used in disaster-hit areas.\n\nUsed to combat cavities, periodontitis and bad breath, the company's OralPeace products contain an anti-bacterial agent that counters aspiration pneumonia, a lung infection that develops from inhaling food, liquid or vomit into the lungs, said Trife President Daisuke Teshima.\n\nThe company distributed OralPeace products for free at shelters for people affected by the 2016 earthquakes in Kumamoto and this year's Typhoon Faxai. Teshima is hoping to visit disaster-hit areas around the world, as well as refugee camps, in the future and to give his products to people in need.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Startups across Japan have been developing innovative systems to provide people with clean water in disasters, in a country particularly vulnerable to typhoons and earthquakes.
