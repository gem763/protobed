Even second-placed Manchester City are stuttering at the moment.\n\nAnd with five of the Gunners' next seven games against teams in the bottom half of the table, Merson says Ozil can help Emery's side take some big strides towards securing a top-four spot.\n\n\"He\u2019s a luxury player, and the manager has obviously decided he can\u2019t carry a player like that in a team that\u2019s already one of the worst around without the ball,\" former midfielder Merson wrote in his column for the Daily Star .\n\n\"With these games coming up, Arsenal are going to have 70% of the possession. He thrives in those situations.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"Unai Emery should bring him in from the cold. But he won\u2019t.\n\n\"If he plays Ozil and they win, he has to keep playing him, and the manager doesn\u2019t want that. The manager wants him out.\n\n\"And if that\u2019s the plan then they are going to have to swallow a pill and get rid of him in January come what may.\"\n\nArsenal's next game is away to Sheffield United a week on Monday, with Crystal Palace , Wolves , Leicester , Southampton , Norwich and Brighton their next opponents in the Premier League.", "description": "Gunners legend says forgotten man Ozil could help Arsenal take huge strides towards top-four spot in run of winnable fixtures", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20467128.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Watford-v-Arsenal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
