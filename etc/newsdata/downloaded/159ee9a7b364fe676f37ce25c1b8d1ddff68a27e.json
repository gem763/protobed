Authorities say Snell entered the couple's Rehoboth Beach home in July 2018 and asked to use their phone.\n\nCourt records and testimony say Snell then grabbed the 82-year-old man and held a box cutter to his throat. The man yelled out to his 81-year-old wife, who Snell then shoved to the ground.\n\nSnell forced the man, now bound, into the trunk of a car in which the woman was forced into the front seat. He then forced the woman to withdraw cash at an ATM, where he left her and fled in the car that he later abandoned with the man inside.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The News Journal of Wilmington, Del., http://www.delawareonline.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
