I absolutely never see my sister.\n\n\u2018So we\u2019re in one room but that\u2019s it, and I see her on the dancefloor and then maybe I see her at the after party.\u2019\n\nDespite having to judge her sister and her celebrity partner in the competition, Motsi doesn\u2019t feel like she has to be extra harsh on them to avoid being accused of favouritism.\n\nDespite working on the same show, Motsi admits she never sees Oti while filming (Picture: Getty)\n\nMotsi admitted: \u2018No, Oti\u2019s a tough girl, I don\u2019t have to be extra hard. She knows what she wants, she\u2019s ambitious, she\u2019s a clever girl, she\u2019s brilliant and she knows when it\u2019s her time, so I can be honest and that\u2019s the most important thing. She\u2019s amazing.\u2019\n\nShe also revealed why she appeared to be \u2018livid\u2019 at the result of last weekend\u2019s show, when Mike Bushell was saved over Catherine Tyldesley.\n\nMotsi explained: \u2018Well, I was sad, I was sad because I see Johannes [Radebe], he\u2019s a young man from South Africa, I see what he\u2019s achieved, I loved what he did last week.\n\n\u2018I see those two, they\u2019re so close together and just seeing their sadness, it comes to you and you just let it out.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB, will broadcast on ITV on 5 November at 8pm.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
