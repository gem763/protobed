But he didn\u2019t become a musician. He studied science and became one of the pioneers of modern physics.\n\nA person\u2019s choice of subjects is very important. That\u2019s why students \u2013 not parents or teachers \u2013 should decide which subjects they are going to study at senior secondary level. Most Hong Kong parents want their children to become doctors, lawyers, or engineers. I don\u2019t think this is right.\n\nThrough success and failure, students will end up knowing what they are good at and if they have the ability and motivation to make a successful career out of it.\n\nIf they lack passion and interest in a subject, they cannot succeed in it.\n\nTeenagers are curious and want to try new things. Arts can encourage the development of creativity, critical thinking, and self-confidence. On the other hand, science has also led to many inventions that have been useful for us, such as the light bulb and cars.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether a student picks arts or science as long as they are passionate about it. Both areas can help the development of civilisation.\n\nStudents should have the right to decide their future, which is why they should be allowed to focus on maths and science, or music and arts \u2013 or both, if they want.\n\nEducation loses its meaning if students\u2019 core values and freedoms are taken away.\n\nFrom Typhoon Mangkhut to Chinglish: Winning student poets on the challenges of writing HK stories for a global audience\n\nIris Lee, 17, Hong Kong International School\n\nToo often, we think along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m more of a maths-science guy\u201d or \u201cJeez, I guess I\u2019m really not an English person\u201d.\n\nThe world does not work this way. We don\u2019t have separate maths-science, humanities, and arts groups. There is no special maths gene or arts gene. However, we (myself included) tend to fall into this short-sighted trap, which limits our growth.\n\nIf students had a wider choice in the subjects they learned, most would select ones they feel most comfortable with. This is especially true in a competitive place like Hong Kong, where the love of learning is often overridden by test scores and perfect grades.\n\nParents may also have \u201cpower\u201d over their children\u2019s studies, urging them to take subjects that have the best job prospects or the most social recognition. Those who have had a well-rounded secondary school education almost always end up getting a high salary, though.\n\nI would argue specifically for the importance of arts in education. For example, top music or literary awards are not only a plus for job or university applications, they are capsules of the universal human experience. We need to cultivate heightened sensibility, passion, and empathy in our generation.\n\nIn the film Dead Poets Society, English teacher John Keating (played by Robin Williams) says:\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t read and write poetry because it\u2019s cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.\u201d\n\nI think that says it all \u2013 students should study maths, science, music and the arts because that is the only way they will get full value for their education.\n\nEdited by M.
