We had him at West Brom, we took him on loan and we could never get him fit. He got taken off in an under-21 game,\u201d Pulis told Sky Sports.\n\nGnabry managed only three senior games at the Hawthorns, two of which were in the League Cup, in an unsuccessful loan spell at The Hawthorns before returning to north London.\n\n\u201cHe went back to Arsenal and they sold him on. He was a good kid... didn\u2019t mind him at all. He\u2019s fulfilled his potential. You can knock me over with a feather,\u201d Pulis added.\n\n\u201cHaving worked with him at West Brom and seeing him there to what he\u2019s done is just absolutely amazing. When people show what they can really do... really knuckle down and become so good, as he\u2019s done, it\u2019s absolutely fantastic.\u201d\n\nShortly after helping Bayern become the first team to score seven goals away to Tottenham in any competition, Gnabry said the result was a message to the rest of Europe.\n\nHe had another one on Twitter for fans of his former employers Arsenal, writing: \u201cNorth London is RED!!!\u201d", "description": "Former West Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis said he struggled to get Serge Gnabry fit for under-21 matches during the winger's loan spell at the club but hailed his amazing transformation at Bayern Munich following his Champions League heroics on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436120800&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910AF"}
