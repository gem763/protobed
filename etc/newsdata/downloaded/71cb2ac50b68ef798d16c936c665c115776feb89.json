The S&P slipped 0.84% to 2966.60 and the was off 0.53% (or around 142 points) to 26,807.77.\n\n\n\nThe major indices are still up for the historically-difficult month of September, but we certainly can\u2019t have many more sessions like this in the remaining four days.\n\n\n\nEven without all the impeachment talk, this would have probably been a rough day for stocks. The President gave a speech at the UN today and was pretty tough on China, which is not what the market wanted to hear as we hopefully head toward high-level trade meetings next month.\n\n\n\nThe one thing the market didn\u2019t need was another uncertainty, but here it is! Impeachments (or inquiries into them) don\u2019t come around every day. Last time with President Clinton in the 90s, stocks plunged at the outset but more than recovered afterward.\n\n\n\nNo one knows how it will work out this time. However, we DO know that there will be tons of new headlines and tweets moving forward, which means stocks will remain susceptible to the whims of the daily newsflow.\n\n\n\nSo, there\u2019s nothing new on that front. We\u2019ll just have a lot more potential for stocks to swing sharply in either direction.\n\n\n\nThe more immediate question is what this political turmoil could be mean for the trade negotiations. Might China decide to take it slower with Trump under pressure, or can they not afford to keep putting things off?\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the problem with uncertainties\u2026 we don\u2019t have the answers yet!\n\n\n\nToday's Portfolio Highlights:\n\n\n\nStocks Under $10: This portfolio has several stocks that are really moving of late, so Brian wants a new position that\u2019s not as volatile. He thinks that Playa Hotels & Resorts (PLYA) will fit the bill. The company owns, operates and develops resorts, primarily in Mexico and the Caribbean. The editor feels this name will be more stable and not move by 5% or more very often. Plus, it\u2019s nice to see that PLYA has reported back-to-back triple-digit quarterly surprises. The portfolio also moved to protect its gain in The Rubicon Project (RUBI) on Tuesday after a third of its gain recently faded away. Brian sold it and secured a profit of 38.1% in about three months. Read the full write-up for more on all of today\u2019s moves.\n\n\n\nHome Run Investor: Sometimes it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. Brian doesn\u2019t like the market action right now, especially when looking at the and the continued pressure on some tech names. Therefore, he \u201clightened the load\u201d across all his services today by selling big winners while he can still secure double-digit returns. In this portfolio, he sold software development company Zendesk (ZEN) for a 56.6% return in about 18 months and also got out of electronics \u2013 manufacturing machinery company Ultra Clean (UCTT) for a 31.9% profit in nearly 5 months.\n\n\n\nTechnology Innovators: In this portfolio, Brian continued his \u201cde-risking\u201d moves by cashing out a couple big-cap tech names amid all the selling. He sold Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and banked a 21.1% return, while also getting out of Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) for a 5% profit. The portfolio also sold FANG+ Index 3X Leveraged ETN (FNGU) and secured 19.3%.\n\n\n\nZacks Short List: There\u2019s only one swap in this week\u2019s adjustment. The portfolio short-covered Gardner Denver Holdings (GDI) for a return of 7.2% and replaced it by adding Ceridian HCM Holding (CDAY).
