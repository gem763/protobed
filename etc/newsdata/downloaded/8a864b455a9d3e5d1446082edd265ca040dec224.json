What is indisputable is the extreme angst this action has caused to employees ... and of course the directors who were the subject of serious allegations of theft and fraud questioning their integrity and that of the corporate operations.'\n\nA Leicestershire Police spokesperson said: 'On April 24, 2018, we received a report of fraud relating to a company in North West Leicestershire and an investigation was carried out into the allegation made.\n\n'As part of this investigation extensive enquiries were carried out and no further action is being taken by Leicestershire Police. All relevant parties have been informed of this decision.'\n\nAndrew Bridgen faces a separate legal action over alleged unpaid rent for living in the Old Vicarage, complete with swimming pool in 5.5 acres of land in the village of Coleorton\n\nThe MP's legal action against AB Produce, where his brother Paul also owns a 45 per cent stake, is ongoing. In turn, the politician faces a separate legal action from the company over alleged unpaid rent for living in the Old Vicarage, complete with swimming pool in 5.5 acres of land in the Leicestershire village of Coleorton.\n\nBridgen Investments \u2013 a property company within the AB Produce empire \u2013 bought the property for \u00a31.5million from the MP in 2012, documents on Land Registry show.\n\nBridgen lives there with his second wife, Serbian opera singer Nevena Pavlovic, creator of the Wives of Westminster lifestyle blog, whom he married in 2017.\n\nHe moved into the Old Vicarage in 2015 after divorcing from his first wife Jackie, with whom he has two sons. It had been their family home until they bought a luxury property with a swimming pool and tennis court in 2011 for \u00a32.1million, which they sold in 2015 after their split.\n\nAccounts filed in June on Companies House show Bridgen Investments claims Andrew Bridgen owes more than \u00a3100,000 in rent from living at the Old Vicarage. The MP is disputing that claim.\n\nAccounts for AB Produce, one of the companies in the group, claim Andrew Bridgen still uses a company car and that it 'provides certain other personal benefits' to him. It said the taxable value of these benefits, including the car, was \u00a381,000 for the three years to 2017.\n\nKPMG quit as the AB Produce's auditors in February, saying it had been unable to 'obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence' to sign off the accounts\n\nBridgen Investments accounts for the year ended May 2018 had to be filed without being audited.\n\nThe company said: 'Once the current audit tender process has been completed and new auditors appointed, it is the directors' intention to file an audited version of these financial statements.'\n\nAccounts for AB Produce Trading, the parent company of the group, and its subsidiary AB Produce are overdue and should have been filed by May this year.\n\nThe directors have claimed the fraud allegations have caused delays to filing previous accounts. The last accounts for the group for the year ended May 2017 showed revenues hit \u00a327.2million. But it made a pre-tax loss of \u00a3244,000.\n\nThe company blamed 'significant challenges in the post-Brexit era' including the flow of goods and labour from Europe, which it said was hurting operating margins.\n\nYesterday, AB Produce declined to comment beyond the letter.\n\nLawyers for the MP said: 'Andrew Bridgen is pursuing a civil claim in the High Court and, given that proceedings are ongoing, it is not appropriate to comment at this time.'", "description": "Tory MP Andrew Bridgen is embroiled in an extraordinary row with his family's farming empire after accusing his brother and other directors of fraud.", "authors": ["Jamie Nimmo For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
