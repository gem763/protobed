But the repeated insistence that Chelsea Clinton is fascinating . . . is actually rather fascinating. It\u2019s like a giant social experiment, in which everyone who has spent decades building connections to the Clinton political dynasty attempts to make the world see the president\u2019s daughter as someone she isn\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWitness the recent insistence that we\u2019re seeing a new side of Chelsea Clinton . . . because she\u2019s tweeting a lot of critical things about President Trump. This is not particularly unusual behavior for a Democrat with a Twitter account. Yet Politico declares that she \u201clets loose on Twitter\u201d with \u201ca spicy, sarcastic online personality.\u201d CNN concurs that \u201cChelsea Clinton embraces her Twitter sass.\u201d\n\nAlmost every time the younger Clinton opens her mouth, it is treated as inherently newsworthy. Neontaster notices that The Hill has tweeted about her 70 times since the beginning of the year.\n\nWhy is Chelsea Clinton news? She\u2019s the scion of America\u2019s most famous Democratic dynasty, sure, but her own accomplishments in public life are meager. When can we stop pretending that hers is a voice worth listening to?\n\nIn fact, she\u2019s pretty much the worst possible person to be speaking on behalf of Democrats right now. At a time when one of the preeminent problems in American life is a sense of declining economic opportunity and social mobility, she\u2019s the living embodiment of inherited privilege.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a few years of attempting to work in consulting and at hedge funds, she concluded she \u201ccouldn\u2019t care about money on a fundamental level.\u201d Then, with no experience in television journalism, she had her people call up the networks and set up a bidding war for her services as a correspondent. She made $600,000 per year for part-time work at NBC, generating what the Baltimore Sun\u2019s David Zurawik called \u201ca handful of reports that no self-respecting affiliate in a top 20 market would air.\u201d\n\nShe was named an \u201cassistant vice provost\u201d at NYU at age 30. She was picked to give the keynote address at South by Southwest, and honored as one of Glamour magazine\u2019s \u201cWomen of the Year.\u201d Now she makes $1,083 per minute speaking to public universities. And almost everything she does is decreed to be extraordinary by a pliant, pro-Clinton media. The New York Times even interviewed her about her favorite books.\n\nThe uptick in Chelsea coverage since November has a transparent purpose, of course: to pave the way for her entry into politics. In Bustle, Charlie Beckerman declares, \u201cthough there\u2019s certainly an argument to be made for the need for new blood in the Democratic party, it\u2019s hard to make the case that Clinton would be ill-suited to politics if she chose to pursue it as a calling.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReally? Yes, she has a famous last name and her parents\u2019 Rolodex of powerful donors and friends. But what does she herself bring to the table that any other educated 37-year-old doesn\u2019t? Do you remember anything from her address at the 2016 Democratic convention? Any of her statements on the trail for her mother, other than her shamelessly inaccurate claim that Bernie Sanders wanted to \u201cstrip millions and millions and millions of people of their health insurance\u201d? Even her greatest strength, the family name, isn\u2019t what it used to be: It\u2019s been more than decade since a Clinton won any race for public office, and Hillary\u2019s stunning loss to Trump is still fresh in Democrats\u2019 minds.\n\nYet quite a few powerful people in Democratic politics and the media remain heavily invested in the Clinton dynasty, and those investments seem less valuable than ever now. It makes sense that they\u2019d be desperate to recoup something from years of sucking up, and thus eager to float Hillary for mayor of New York City or Chelsea for Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Chelsea\u2019s case, such pipe dreams only seem plausible if you believe that she is a natural leader, waiting in the wings for the right opportunity to save a Democratic party in ruins. And if you believe that, you must not have been paying attention the last 30 years.", "description": "The media should stop trying to pave the way for Chelsea Clinton to launch a career in politics.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
