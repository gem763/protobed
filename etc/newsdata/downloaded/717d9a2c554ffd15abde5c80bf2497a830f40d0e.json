REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nThe Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, representing 13 major global oil companies, held meetings with around 20 students and young professionals aimed at laying the groundwork for a long-term plan to engage with young people.\n\nIt took place as top oil company CEOs, including BP Plc\u2019s (BP.L) Bob Dudley and Royal Dutch Shell Plc\u2019s (RDSa.L) Ben van Beurden, met to discuss the industry\u2019s response to climate change, while Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg angrily condemned world leaders and industry for failing to act quickly enough on the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about dialogue and to have dialogue you have to have transparency,\u201d said Eldar S\u00e6tre, CEO of Norwegian oil company Equinor ASA (EQNR.OL), who said handling youth anger towards his industry is \u201ctough.\u201d\n\nGeraldine Satre Buisson, a 28-year-old seeking a Ph.D. in climate change policy and science communication at Imperial College London, said she participated in Friday\u2019s global climate strike, in which more than 4 million people walked out of school or work to demand emergency action on climate change.\n\nBuisson took part in Monday\u2019s dialogue reluctantly but said she felt it was necessary to channel the anger she felt on the streets into action by meeting face-to-face with oil executives.\n\n\u201cI felt generally that we had an opportunity to be heard but I am not sure that being heard will translate into action,\u201d she said, adding that the executives dodged questions about Thunberg.\n\nFaiza Haq, a 24-year-old student at Columbia University in New York studying energy and the environment, said when she went into the room, \u201cI didn\u2019t go with a feeling of trust.\u201d\n\nWhile she said the industry is taking positive steps by making some investments in renewable energy and technology to capture and store carbon, she suspects the companies have been pushing Washington to deregulate their industry.\n\n\u201cThey are doing things that are very positive, but what is the transparency that is happening?\u201d she said.\n\nThe night before the event around 40 protesters gathered outside a New York hotel hosting a private Oil and Gas Climate Initiative dinner. Some held up \u201cWanted\u201d signs emblazoned with the faces and names of the CEOs of Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N).\n\nThe protesters chanted: \u201cNo gas, no oil - keep the carbon in the soil!\u201d and \u201cThey knew, they lied, they need to pay!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am here to tell fossil fuel companies that our lives matter and that climate change is not affecting us in 10 years but right now,\u201d said Mayana Torres, 19, a student and volunteer with SustainUS, a youth-led movement campaigning to bar fossil fuel companies from influencing climate policy.\n\nChristina Figueres - the former executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, who helped finalise the Paris Agreement - told oil executives at a session later on Monday that they have to take bolder action or risk becoming obsolete.\n\n\u201cThe stigma this industry has acquired does not allow you to attract the best and brightest,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you need the best and brightest for a transformation.\u201d", "description": "Facing rising anger from young people for their role in accelerating climate change, chief executives of major oil companies launched an effort on Monday to burnish their image on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Action Summit.", "authors": ["Valerie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433125356&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M28R", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
