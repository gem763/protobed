While Dermot O'Leary also steps back into his presenter's shoes.\n\nAnd music mogul and the mastermind behind the singing extravaganza, Simon Cowell, reveals exactly why he decided to revamp the much-loved show.\n\nLook who's back: The X Factory: Celebrity is set to hit our screens in a few weeks, and ahead of the launch, the first official pictures of the judges have been revealed\n\nPromo images from the new show see former Pussycat Doll Nicole, 41, looking her usual glamorous self in a shimmering, tasselled dress as she stands between her fellow judges and host Dermot.\n\nWhile the 14 all-star acts also pose up a storm in snazzy new images for the ITV show.\n\nIn an interview ahead of the launch, Simon, 60, revealed the reason why he decided to revamp the normal show into a celebrity version.\n\n'It just felt so obvious to do a celebrity version', he explained. 'The only condition was I couldn\u2019t know who was going to be on it. I said to the team, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find some acts who you believe can sell records off the back of this, because if you don\u2019t do that it won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nNew idea: 'It just felt so obvious to do a celebrity version', he explained. 'The only condition was I couldn\u2019t know who was going to be on it'\n\n'So that was the deal and we stuck to it. I swear to God I didn\u2019t have a clue who any of the acts were. I did walk away thinking, \u201cIf we\u2019re smart, we have artists here who could actually sell records off the back of this\u201d. So I thought that was fun and very exciting for the show.'\n\nThe music boss also shared how he felt about holding the auditions in his own back garden.\n\nHe said: 'When we filmed it that night it didn\u2019t feel like work. I loved every second of it. I said to the producers, \u201cIf this really doesn\u2019t work, we will have to re-audition for the show. That\u2019s the deal.\u201d\n\n'So the fact that I felt we didn\u2019t need to was just great. I found it interesting and fun, and doing this version of the show has also given me the chance to do All Stars. I\u2019ve wanted to make the best of the best version of The X Factor for a long, long time. It\u2019s been brilliant. I\u2019ve loved every minute.'\n\nUnexpected: 'What we\u2019re doing this year I think is a brilliant idea. I think everyone\u2019s going to love watching these celebrities because it\u2019s not what people expect. Some of them are really good'\n\nBattle: The Don't Hold Your Breath hitmaker ensured that she'll be as competitive as ever this year. 'Oh always!' she insisted. 'You can\u2019t take that out of me!

I think everyone\u2019s going to love watching these celebrities because it\u2019s not what people expect. Some of them are really good.\n\n'The show feels more exciting, there\u2019s no bootcamp, no six chair challenge, it feels slick this year. It\u2019s been the best show on TV for a long time and has just had a little rebranding, I suppose, a new X Factor.'\n\nWhile Nicole explained why the celebrity version differs from the civilian edition.\n\nShe explained: 'Obviously it\u2019s a lot shorter, which is the difference between The X Factor: Celebrity and the ones in the past. This one doesn\u2019t have boot camp and all that jazz, and I loved that we just cut straight to the chase. I was really excited to see who the celebrities were going to be.'\n\nTrusting: 'I think the same as him in many ways. You\u2019ve always got to trust him. That\u2019s the thing. No one\u2019s infallible but his instinct is more often than not right. I think it\u2019s a good shout'\n\nBig plans: 'People think that I sang in Hairspray. I did not sing in Hairspray. The original movie was all about dancing. So yeah, I\u2019m hoping maybe one of those doors opens when people see me on the The X Factor'\n\nAnd the Don't Hold Your Breath hitmaker ensured that she'll be as competitive as ever this year.\n\n'Oh always!' she insisted. 'You can\u2019t take that out of me! I\u2019m just going to be very supportive.\n\n'This year I think the way Simon has done it is that we help them and support them.

But I\u2019m ready to see what they are going to bring to this show.'\n\nElsewhere, front man Dermot, 46, revealed what he thought when Simon decided to rip up the rule book and do a celebrity version of The X Factor.\n\nHe said: 'I think the same as him in many ways.

The whole illusion of him being really awful, so it had sort of faded for me, but then we were on that stage singing, and I knew we weren\u2019t being judged but I still couldn\u2019t look at him. I was like, \u201cOh God.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Love Island supergroup, consisting of Eyal Booker, Wes Nelson, Samira Mighty and Zara McDermott, told how they discovered each other could sing while starring on the show.\n\nWes said: ' In the villa, we all knew that we could sing because we were singing all the time, we never shut up.'\n\nAs Eyal added: 'Yeah, Wes would sing in the shower, him and Samira would harmonise and stuff together.

I don\u2019t think anything that he can say will ever put us off'\n\nMeanwhile, rugby hunk Bed Foden, of sport star group Try Star, revealed his career would have been very different if he followed his first love of singing.\n\nHe said: 'I\u2019ve always been a bit of a singer. When I got to the age of 17 I had to decide whether to go into professional sport or not. If I didn\u2019t get a professional contract in rugby, I was going to go to London and go to a performance school.\n\n'I was going to venture down that path, but obviously the rugby got in the way of that and I spent the last 15 years playing rugby instead of trying my hand at music.'\n\nSocial media stars Max and Harvey meanwhile admitted that they are not scared of what Simon will say about their performances.\n\nOpinionated: 'You\u2019ve got to know your place in the chain, and my place in this chain is not, \u201cI know what\u2019s best.\u201d I can\u2019t promise that I will bite my tongue'\n\nSo lovely: 'The other celebrities were so awesome, I thought they were very cool and easy to talk to. Of course, it\u2019s so scary going into a room with all the contestants and not knowing any of them personally but it was super chill'\n\nThey told: 'I think we\u2019ll be able to take it as constructive criticism. I don\u2019t think anything that he can say will ever put us off.'\n\nSpeaking of Simon, former Strictly star Brendan Cole, of group Cole & Edwards, confessed that he may not be able to hold his tongue when Simon criticises them.\n\nFamously known for his opinionated demeanour on Strictly, he said: 'You\u2019ve got to know your place in the chain, and my place in this chain is not, \u201cI know what\u2019s best.\u201d I can\u2019t promise that I will bite my tongue.
