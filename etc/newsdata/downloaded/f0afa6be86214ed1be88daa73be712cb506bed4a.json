Grice, who was 20, signed up immediately.\n\nIn 2000, after three months of performing administrative tasks for the ministry, she was promoted to being Michael\u2019s personal assistant\u2014a job she held for 11 years that she equated with \u201cbeing another form of Michael Rozell.\u201d\n\nSoon into her new role though Michael started to scream over the smallest inconveniences, usually for hours. The alleged abuse would sometimes even take a sexual turn, according to Grice.\n\n\u201cHe would just repeat whatever you said and make a masturbating gesture with his hands near his crotch,\u201d Grice said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard he also asked several girls if they ever struggled with sexual sin,\u201d she added. \u201cAccording to Michael, sexual sin was masturbating or watching porn and he apparently would force girls to talk about it in detail for hours.\u201d\n\nLike Grice, several former members said they heard and were personally asked by Michael Rozell frequently if they had \u201cstruggled with sexual sin.\u201d One former member, who joined Potter\u2019s Field in 2017, said Rozell once asked her if she \u201cever let a dog lick [her] down there.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe completely disregarded the relationship between a pastor and his church members,\u201d the member said. \u201cHe shared with me about another girl\u2019s sexual sin and then asked me if her sin was normal for little girls.\u201d\n\nGrice is among a dozen former interns, staff members, and missionaries who spoke to The Daily Beast about the alleged abuse by the Rozells. They also said the Rozells built their multi-million dollar business empire\u2014including a hamburger chain\u2014off the backs of young people who were practically forced to work for free.\n\n\u201c I spent my childhood watching people yell at each other. So when I came to Potter\u2019s Field and got yelled at everyday I didn\u2019t blink an eye. \u201d \u2014 Dawn Marie Grice\n\nTheir ministry was abruptly shut down by its sponsor church last month following a slew of allegations of verbal and emotional abuse against young people, inhumane working conditions, sexual harassment, and misappropriation of funds.\n\nThe allegations have spurred two law firms to consider suing Potter\u2019s Field Ministry or the Rozells and have prompted the Montana attorney general\u2019s office to investigate.\n\nThe Rozells declined to comment on the allegations. Ministry representatives said the pair are remaining silent \u201cout of respect to those who have been hurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cMichael would repeatedly say if you leave Potter\u2019s Field you are in sin,\u201d Grice said. \u201cThat brainwashing, the constant repeating and hitting at your religious. How could you leave if you thought leaving Potter\u2019s Field was leaving your faith?\u201d\n\nThe Rozells were well-known in the evangelical community in the Pacific Northwest, former members say.\n\nOver three decades, the pair built up Potter\u2019s Field Ministry with sponsorship by one of the nation\u2019s biggest evangelical groups, Calvary Chapel Association, based in California. Several young men and women said they specifically moved to Whitefish to learn from the Rozells and participate in their missionary program established in six foreign countries.\n\nSupporting it all financially was a mini-business empire called Potter\u2019s Field Ranch. The Rozells made money from their ministry, a missionary program where people paid thousands of dollars to participate, as well as a fast-food chain they started called MudMan. Between the ministry and the ranch, the Rozells\u2019 made $5 million in 2016 alone, according to the most recent tax records available.\n\nBut before they were rich, the pair were just a struggling couple who devoted their lives to spreading the gospel through community outreach and entertainment.\n\nPam was a former Miss Georgia pursuing a career in singing and theatre, including acts on Broadway and cruise ships, before transitioning to record Christian music. (She currently has 10 Christian records.) Michael, originally from southern California, was a former regional marketing director at a Wall Street firm and dabbled in pottery. They met in 1987 on a blind date and married three weeks later, according to Pam\u2019s autobiography, Stones of Remembrance.\n\nAfter several years of touring with a traveling missionary, the Rozells moved to Montana in 1992 where they established Potter's Field Ministries, a church dedicated to sharing the gospel \u201cthrough the medium of pottery and song.\u201d\n\nDuring on-stage performances, Pam would sing hymns while her husband would create various clay vases and bowls on a pottery wheel in front of hundreds of people. The pair stopped numerous times throughout their act, allowing Michael to preach the gospel and equate the day\u2019s lesson with clay.\n\n\u201cIf you brought a Bible this morning, keep it shut. The reason is you\u2019re going to walk into your Bible,\u201d Michael said at the start of every performance before launching into the section of the Bible he was going to teach.\n\nThe Rozells made more than 200 appearances across the country until this year, hawking personal testimonies and a stand to sell pottery, CDs, and other merchandise.\n\nAs their enterprise started to grow, the Rozells brought in outside help: young interns who would live on their ranch.\n\nAlissa Militello, a lifelong member of the evangelical Calvary Chapel, was finishing up another church internship in 2001 when the Rozells invited her to join their internship program and live for free at Potter\u2019s Field Ranch.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, saying yes to the Rozells was the biggest mistake I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d Militello said.\n\nInterns were expected to go to the Rozells\u2019 house to complete various administrative tasks, such as collating and making packets to send to prospective churches. Militello, 19 at the time, lived on the ranch the Rozells advertised as a \u201csanctuary for pastors and performance ministry works that needed to get away.\u201d In reality, Grice said, they were made to stay in an old farm house that had very little heat, no furniture other than a couple mattresses on the floor, and a severe rat problem.\n\n\u201cYou had to be super quiet when you were home,\u201d she said. \u201cYou basically had to be invisible.\u201d\n\nIn the office, Militello said Michael was often yelling on the phone, which made her uncomfortable although she never spoke up out of fear.\n\nAnd then one day, Rozell\u2019s anger turned on her.\n\n\u201cI made a clerical error on a letter that was printed for a prospective packet, and Mike took the letter and started yelling and walked towards me to the point I was against the wall,\u201d Militello said. \u201cHe had the letter in one hand and a finger close to my face and I just couldn\u2019t stop crying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never, and will never, be as scared as I was pushed against that wall while Mike screamed in my face,\u201d she added.\n\nGrice, who was an intern with Militello, equated Michael\u2019s hours-long rants with psychological torture.\n\n\u201cHe knew I had a difficult relationship with my mom. So whenever he could, he would throw it in my face that I was like my mother,\u201d she said. \u201cHe went into every screaming rant knowing he was going to yell at me until he was going to make me cry.\u201d\n\nDespite the constant yelling and belittlement, Grice said she first stayed because she lived on the property and was being paid about $500 a week. But being from an abusive home, she said, she \u201cthought that\u2019s just how people communicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent my childhood watching people yell at each other,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when I came to Potter\u2019s Field and got yelled at everyday I didn\u2019t blink an eye.\u201d\n\nBy 2009, the Rozells had expanded their empire in Potter\u2019s Field Ranch to establish the IGNITE internship. The one-year leadership training program allowed interns to train for three months in Montana before serving for six months abroad. Once they returned to Montana, interns spent their final three months in a \u201cre-entry\u201d period to \u201creflect on their lessons and experiences.\u201d\n\nThe nonprofit \u201cschool of discipleship, making disciples for the Lord Jesus Christ\u201d required interns to pay $6,000 for the training and missionary work abroad. They were sent to Costa Rica, Guatemala, Uganda, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Cambodia.\n\nOne of the IGNITE interns, Sonesta Josephsen, was 21 when she flew to Guatemala to serve a mission in July 2016.\n\nJosephsen said she first heard about the program through other interns and joining one of the Bible study groups, but did not make enough money at her entry-level bank job to make the $7,000 deposit\u2014not counting airfare and meals. Her local church hosted a fundraiser to help her meet her goal and she joined IGNITE\u2019s 11th internship class.\n\nThe Rozell were ecstatic to have her, she said.\n\n\u201cMike gave me the nickname Sunny and I felt like he instantly latched on,\u201d Josephsen said.\n\nOnce she landed in Guatemala, Josephsen said she and several other women were transported to a \u201ccompound\u201d where a supervisor from Potter\u2019s Field Ministries limited internet and phone access so the women could not contact their family back home.\n\nAfter Guatemala, Josephsen traveled to Cambodia to six months to complete the second leg of her mission trip. Inside the house devoted to Potter\u2019s Field Ranch, over 10 women lived with no air conditioning, no hot water, and no furniture. Josephsen said throughout the program, she only saw the children they were brought to mentor about 10 times.\n\n\u201cPeople donated thousands of dollars, as interns we paid thousands of dollars, but I still have no idea where any of that money went. It certainly didn\u2019t go to the kids we were dedicating our time to helping,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201c The pay was garbage and the hours were ridiculous. \u201d \u2014 Kenzie Kinney\n\nWhile Josephsen thought her mission experience abroad was a \u201cnightmare,\u201d she said the true horror story didn\u2019t occur until her \u201cre-entry\u201d period in April 2017.\n\nBack in Montana, Josephsen said she was woken up from the girl\u2019s boarding house around 10 p.m. one night. The two women who woke her up said that Michael needed to \u201csee her immediately,\u201d and escorted her to the house of one of the ministry\u2019s leaders.\n\nWhen she walked into her house, she said, Michael and two other leaders immediately started to berate about her best friend who had just left the ministry.\n\n\u201cThey called her a drug addict, a whore, a liar, and thief, and a manipulator that just used me,\u201d Josephsen said. \u201cThey told me she never loved me and I had to sever ties with her immediately.\u201d\n\nDistracted by the yelling, Josephsen said she did not notice when one of the ministry leaders took her phone and typed out a message to her friend. The message, which she said was typed out as if it was in her \u201cown voice,\u201d said the friend was not qualified to speak to Josephsen anymore and needed to \u201canswer for her wrongdoings.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of the things they accused of her were true,\u201d Josephsen said. \u201cThey were just using me to hurt her because she left the ministry and they were upset. They ruined my friendship forever because they were offended.\u201d\n\nJosephsen said after the leaders showed her the message, they asked her permission to send it\u2014saying she wouldn\u2019t be a \u201ctrue Jesus follower\u201d if she refused. Fearing the repercussions of saying no, she nodded yes.\n\n\u201cI will forever regret that nod,\u201d she said, adding that she left the ministry soon after.\n\nSome former members said they left the ministry penniless\u2014sometimes even in the middle of the night\u2014fearing the Rozells would tarnish their reputation to their friends, like what Josephsen experienced. At least four former members said they have been seeking professional counseling since, and one said they have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder from the abuse.\n\n\u201cIt somebody left Potter\u2019s Field, we were forced to cut off all contact and pretend they never existed,\u201d one former member, adding \u201cthose who left were betrayers who lived in sin and no longer safe.\u201d\n\nInterns who participated in the \u201cre-entry\u201d process, were immediately put to work at one of the Rozell\u2019s several businesses.\n\nOne of the businesses was Mudman, a chain of four fast-food joints in Montana serving monstrously sized burgers\u2014with the logo of a man in sunglasses who resembled Michael.\n\n\u201cThe high school students around town called Mudman \u2018cult burger,\u2019\u201d Militello said.\n\nAll proceeds were intended to go toward funding for the international missionary program.\n\nFormer interns said they were paid below minimum wage and forced to work 60- to 80-hour weeks. In addition to the grueling work hours, former intern say, the ministry would often schedule ministry commitments late at night or early in the morning.\n\nBefore they began work, interns were required to sign a contract mandating \u201cstarting upon receipt of first paycheck\u201d they work at least 25 hours per week at MudMan while paying $200 per month rent to Potter\u2019s Field Ministries.\n\nKenzie Kinney, a former IGNITE intern who worked at MudMan, said the burger chain\u2019s employees worked up to 60 hours a week and earned as little as $2 an hour.\n\n\u201cThe pay was garbage and the hours were ridiculous,\u201d Kinney said.\n\nKinney said most of their paycheck was filtered back into the ministry between rent, sponsoring the ministry, (which was about $20 a month) and giving 10 percent of their paycheck back in tithe.\n\n\u201cIn addition to that, we would be rebuked for only sponsoring the ministry the bare minimum. So most of us were guilted into giving more money to the ministry than just the standard $20 a month,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite the grueling schedule, Grice explained, interns felt spiritually pressured to subject themselves to the Rozells\u2019 demands to avoid their wrath.\n\n\u201cMichael would repeatedly say if you leave Potter\u2019s Field you are in sin,\u201d Grice said. \u201cThat brainwashing, the constant repeating and hitting at your religious. How could you leave if you thought leaving Potter\u2019s Field was leaving your faith?\u201d\n\nBy 2019, according to several members, word of the allegations against the Rozells finally got back to Calvary Chapel Association. In July, the Calvary Chapel removed Potter\u2019s Field Ministry from their official list of affiliated pastors and churches.\n\n\u201cWe find that the Potter\u2019s Field form of discipleship training and methods of ministry are not compatible with the Calvary Chapel form of ministry,\u201d Calvary Chapel said in a statement.\n\nAlthough the Rozells have stepped down from their day-to-day leadership roles, both are still listed as board members of the ministry, a spokesperson said. Calvary Chapel, however, named Pastor Rob McCoy the ministry\u2019s new CEO.\n\nMcCoy assembled a group of independent pastors to look into the allegations against Potter\u2019s Field. He said they discovered that about half of the $100,000 in monthly donations intended to sponsor children abroad were actually used to keep the IGNITE internship program afloat.\n\nThe discovery prompted Calvary Chapel and McCoy\u2014who is also the mayor of Thousand Oaks, California\u2014to hire a third-party auditor to look into all of Potter\u2019s Field finances.\n\n\u201cThis is my first experience with this type of situation,\u201d McCoy said in the statement. \u201cIn the rapid decline of these ministries, the bulk of my time has been spent attempting to pull students back from foreign missions, returning students to their families, paying the debts and monthly expenses of the ministries and the resignation of some 40 staff people who today may be hurting due to their sudden loss of employment and loss of community.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Montana attorney general\u2019s office told The Daily Beast that while they are \u201caware of the issue,\u201d they declined to comment further.\n\nIn August, two Montana law firms sent a letter to former members asking those who were allegedly abused by the Rozells to come forward to possibly take legal action. The two firms also hope to stop the Rozells from liquidating the Potter\u2019s Field Ministry before alleged victims have a chance to sue.\n\nAttorney Tanis Holm of Edminston and Colton told The Daily Beast that the firms have already heard from over 100 individuals who have alleged various forms of abuse, ranging from \u201cviolations in work laws to sexual harrassment and sexual assault.\u201d\n\nMilitello said while the process toward justice against the Rozells is just beginning, former members are already finding solace knowing the truth is starting to come out.\n\n\u201cMichael and Pam Rozell made us feel so small, so worthless for so many years,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we all know we are not alone and know that we went through wasn\u2019t right. The Rozells weren\u2019t right.\u201d", "description": "Inside the Montana ministry with a burger chain led by a pottery-spinning pastor, accused of abusing and swindling his flock.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567357805/190901-melendez-pastor-young-women-tease_m3kghx"}
