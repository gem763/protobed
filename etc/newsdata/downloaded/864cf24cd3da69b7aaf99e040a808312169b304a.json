However, the conversation is also very largely focused on Loughlin, who did not admit her guilt, and what should and could happen to her.\n\nFelicity Huffman is being sentenced in the college admissions scandal, but the internet seems more interested in Lori Loughlin's fate. (Photo: John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) More\n\nFor a lot of people, Huffman admitting her guilt \u2014 paying $15,000 to have her daughter\u2019s SAT scores changed in hopes of getting her into a better college \u2014 goes a long way in public opinion. \u201cAt least\u201d she \u201cowned up to what she did,\u201d is a sentiment shared by more than one commenter.\n\nAt least Felicity Huffman owned up to what she did.\n\n\n\nLori Laughlin is STILL out here proudly and indignantly denying doing the same crime & y\u2019all are keekeeing, calling her \u201cAunt Becky\u201d & whatnot.\n\n\n\nFOH.https://t.co/ll6Ufi0mLv \u2014 Fiyah \u270a\ud83c\udffe Angelou (@SweetKixx) September 13, 2019\n\nEven though she\u2019ll only serve about 20 days while someone in NYC last week was sentenced to 30 days in jail for literally stealing a loaf of bread, I\u2019m fine with this. At least she plead guilty straight away and admitted she was wrong, unlike Aunt Becky. https://t.co/XDaY7YK8IQ \u2014 Chewy Yorkie (@ChewyYorkie) September 13, 2019\n\nI completely agree though I do respect that she pled out and took responsibility. Lori Loughlin's behavior is just annoying the crap out of me. \u2014 Bravo Me \ud83d\udc8b\ud83c\udf78 (@realityaddictx) September 13, 2019\n\nAs disgusting as what some of the Hollywood elitest have done, at least this one admits to it & shows humility.\n\nLori Loughlin arrogantly denies, says she's done nothing wrong!\n\nThe ego of some of these people & denial of reality is astounding with actors & actresses. Ya STOLE it!! \u2014 T.A.B.\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f (@tab_bee2) September 13, 2019\n\n@hlnshowbiz Huffman, her character? That\u2019s her job as an actor. The rest is bullshit. But there is a big difference between her and Aunt Becky. She deserves jail time. \u2014 TOTAL LOSER (@Maggie91579371) September 13, 2019\n\nLoughlin, who allegedly paid $500,000 in bribes to get her socialite daughters into University of Southern California as crew recruits, despite neither participating in the sport \u2014 went another route in this case. The Fuller House actress pleaded not guilty, was slapped with an additional charge by federal prosecutors and is now headed to trial, along with her husband, Mossimo Giannulli. They each face up to 40 years in prison.\n\nSocial media is practically salivating over Loughlin\u2019s fate \u2014 and the possibility of her going to prison. \u201cI hope she gets a sentence strong enough to wipe out her entitlement,\u201d wrote one person.\n\nI respect Huffman\u2019s decision to assume responsibility for what she did and take a sentence. Even if it\u2019s a short one, she admitted doing wrong, which is rare these days (ie: Jussie Smollet).\n\nFor Lori Loughlin: I hope she gets a sentence strong enough to wipe out her entitlement. \u2014 Carry (@JustCarryGirl) September 13, 2019\n\n\u201cLeave [Huffman] alone,\u201d wrote another. \u201cGo after Lori Loughlin. She\u2019s not sorry.\u201d\n\nShe knows she was wrong, fine her and leave her alone. Go after Lori Loughlin she's not sorry. \u2014 Madonna Moreland (@MadonnaMoreland) September 13, 2019\n\nLoughlin has also been called \u201csmug\u201d and \u201cdefiant.\u201d\n\n@MorningExp I want to see that Aunt Becky with her smug, defiant self go down! \u2014 @krush_1911 (@krush_1911) September 13, 2019\n\nAs well as \u201carrogant.\u201d", "description": "While Felicity Huffman is the one who has her day in court, social media is abuzz about the fate of \"Aunt Becky.\"", "authors": ["Suzy Byrne", "Editor", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LbalUbMrpcCHXL9uWtc0CQ--~B/aD0xOTU3O3c9Mjc5NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/5bf7ba40-d645-11e9-bdcf-05a723198736", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
