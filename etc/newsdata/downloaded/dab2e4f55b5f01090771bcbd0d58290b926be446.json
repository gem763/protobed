Nearly half of respondents, 49 percent, said Congress should not begin impeachment proceedings, also down a point from last week.\n\n\u201cDespite being a popular topic in the news, support for impeachment proceedings remains relatively unchanged in the past week,\u201d said Tyler Sinclair, Morning Consult\u2019s vice president. \u201cThis week, 36 percent of registered voters, including 33 percent of independents and 5 percent of Republicans, support impeachment. These numbers have remained steady over the summer, with little impact from the latest whistleblower complaint centered on Ukraine so far.\u201d\n\nAbout 66 percent of Democratic voters support opening an impeachment probe.\n\nThe poll did not include detailed questions about the Ukraine scandal, which was still being unraveled when the survey began. After the impeachment question, voters were asked how much they had heard about \u201ca whistleblower complaint from a U.S. intelligence official that reportedly centers on Ukraine and involved communications with a foreign leader and a \u2018promise\u2019 made by President Trump.\u201d\n\nFewer than 1 in 4, 23 percent, had heard \u201ca lot\u201d about the whistleblower complaint, while 31 percent had heard \u201csome,\u201d 23 percent hadn\u2019t heard much and 23 percent had heard \u201cnothing at all.\u201d\n\nThe POLITICO/Morning Consult poll surveyed 1,994 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nMorning Consult is a nonpartisan media and technology company that provides data-driven research and insights on politics, policy and business strategy.\n\nMore details on the poll and its methodology can be found in these two documents: Toplines: https://politi.co/2ll2LRp | Crosstabs: https://politi.co/2mTzddM", "description": "36 percent of voters believe Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against Trump.", "authors": ["Steven Shepard"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9b/f3/e2cf669341608dc1f2c35b3a0594/190924-pelosi-impeachment-1-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
