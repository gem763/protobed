There were 10 last year and seven in 2017.\n\nListen Out followed regulations brought in by the government despite them being repealed by parliament last month.\n\nThe law forced an arbitrary list of 11 'high risk' venues to abide by a list of stricter conditions and obtain a special liquor licence.\n\nPremier Gladys Berejiklian commended the organisers for working with authorities to 'act as though the regulations are still in place'.\n\nSix young revellers were rushed to hospital with drug overdoses from the Listen Out music festival in Sydney this weekend\n\nAdelle Robinson, director of Listen Out organiser Fuzzy Operations, told the committee overseeing the regulations she was 'not exactly sure why' the event were slapped with the 'high risk' status.\n\nShe said 'there was a definite reputational damage' from being among the 11 events and 'everyone has been operating in an atmosphere of fear'.\n\nFuzzy was forced to pay $171,927 under the 'user pays' system of charging organisers for mandatory police presence based on attendee numbers.\n\nPoll Should the NSW Government introduce pill testing at festivals?

I don't think it works, I don't think the evidence is there and I don't support it.'\n\nPill testing would allow revellers to know how strong a pill was before it was taken and cautioned about the risk.\n\nCritics said such testing gave tacit approval to illegal activity and a misreading of tablet strength could lead people into a false sense of security.\n\nListen Out is an over 18s Australian dance and music event, featuring multiple hip hop and electronic artists across four inner city venues across the country.\n\nSome patrons arrived wearing very risqu\u00e9 outfits ready to have a fun-filled day listening to the long list of artists who were due to play.\n\nAustralian record producer, Flume, made a special appearance and performed for the first time in the country since the Falls Festival last year.\n\nThere was a marked police presence for the start of the festival season after five young revellers died at events last spring and summer due to suspected drug overdoses.", "description": "The victims aged in their 20s were among 40,000 people who flocked to the dance music festival in Sydney on Saturday with numerous patrons turned away at the door or arrested.", "authors": ["Nic White For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/08/19353256-0-image-a-16_1570346012420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
