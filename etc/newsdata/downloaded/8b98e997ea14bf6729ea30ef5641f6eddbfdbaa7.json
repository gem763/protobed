Ivy City, the District\u2019s ground zero for distilling, includes a cast of characters that range from former Obama appointees to erstwhile NASA employees, and even the distillers with no apparent government ties are still entrenched in the big politics energy of the city every day, and sometimes even inspired by it.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s just natural. I mean, even the people here who aren\u2019t directly involved in government matters are immersed in this sea of information and government relations,\u201d says New Columbia Distilling co-founder, Michael Lowe. \u201cI think everyone is really conscious of it and it\u2019s only natural to appeal to the DC public by referring to these things.\u201d\n\nFrom cocktail names inspired by presidential tweets to distilleries named after Constitutional amendments, here are some of our favorite political references and tie-ins hidden in Ivy City\u2019s brewing and distilling scene.\n\nA Shot-Sized History Lesson on Ivy City\n\n\n\nWhile hopping from tasting room to tasting room, it sometimes feels as if the distilleries Ivy City has come to be known for have been there since the dawn of time. The reality is that Ivy City\u2019s first distillery only opened its doors in 2012, when Michael Lowe and John Usleton launched New Columbia and released their signature product, Green Hat Gin, thus becoming DC\u2019s first (legal) distillery to open in more than a century. Many others quickly followed suit, with One Eight Distilling opening their doors in 2015, followed closely by Jos. A. Magnus and Republic Restoratives. Today, there are 5 distilleries in Ivy City and a sixth, Cotton and Reed, nearby at Union Market \u2014 that\u2019s the one that was founded by two former NASA strategists.\n\nOne Eight Distillery in Ivy City (Via One Eight)\n\nBefore New Columbia Distillers came to Ivy City, it had been all but abandoned. Even its original inhabitants in 1873 lived without heat or power, and five years later a portion of the neighborhood was turned into a horse-racing track. The track failed after less than a decade of operation, and Ivy City quickly became a warehouse district and the site of a new railyard.\n\n\u201cI think [the introduction of distilleries] made a substantial difference in the neighborhood. When I first got here there it seemed like nobody else came into the area, at least for legal purposes. There were a couple of businesses there, mainly whole seafood distributors, and the Hecht building has been empty for 20 years,\u201d explains Lowe. Ivy City had quickly become an up-and-coming area, now full of shops, restaurants and people walking around on the streets \u2014 an attractive destination for opening up shop. But when Lowe first opened New Columbia there, the decision was pretty much made for him.\n\nPolitical rules and regulations have long affected the alcohol industry, from the times of prohibition, when DC was a \u201cdry city\u201d with a teeming underbelly of wet corruption, to the more recent decision that distilleries must be limited to operating within warehouse zoning areas, making Ivy City the ideal spot for the rebirth of the city\u2019s distilling culture. \u201cDC\u2019s distillery scene didn\u2019t develop like other cities\u2019 did. It wasn\u2019t intentional,\u201d says Republic Restoratives owner Pia Carusone. \u201cBut now that we\u2019re all in the same area, it\u2019s great to have more people walking around and able to hop between the different distilleries.\u201d\n\nThe Man in the Green Hat\n\n\n\nIt was 1920 when George Cassiday, a recent World War I veteran, began selling illegal spirits to House Members during the prohibition on alcohol. Unemployed and looking for a way to make cash, Cassiday became a bootlegger, eventually owning his own office in the basement of the House Office Building \u2014 now the Cannon House Office Building \u2014 where he\u2019d supply booze to thirsty lawmakers.\n\nAfter five years, Cassiday was caught by the feds with bottles of alcohol in his suitcase and a light green felt hat on his head. There was no halting his operation, though. Before long, he\u2019d moved across to the north side of the Capitol building, where he sold booze to senators for another five years. A police raid of Cassiday\u2019s home at the end of 1929 resulted in the seizure of 266 quarts of the good stuff, and he was arrested in a sting operation shortly after. He then penned a series of fame-making articles in the Washington Post detailing how he, The Man in the Green Hat, had been supplying booze to an astounding four out of five DC lawmakers, highlighting the hypocrisy of a supposedly \u201cdry\u201d DC and the failings of prohibition.\n\nNew Columbia\u2019s Green Hat Ginavit (New Columbia / Facebook)\n\nAfter reading through a chapter about the sly, dapper Cassiday in Garrett Peck\u2019s book, Prohibition and Washington DC: How Dry We Weren\u2019t, New Columbia Distillers co-owners Michael Lowe and John Usleton knew they wanted to name their signature Green Hat Gin after his infamous topper. \u201cWe contacted the historian [Peck] and arranged to meet with one of the Cassiday family members. They were really excited about us spreading the family story as a part in the expansion of DC\u2019s alcohol presence,\u201d Lowe tells InsideHook.\n\nCocktails with a Timely Twist\n\n\n\nNew Columbia Distillers\u2019 political references don\u2019t end with Cassiday\u2019s famous green hat. \u201cOn Saturdays we name our specialty cocktails after political events from the previous week,\u201d says Lowe. \u201cIt\u2019s fun and kind of keeps us immersed in what\u2019s going on, and frankly I think people kind of expect it in DC. On a Friday afternoon we\u2019ll kick around a few ideas about what happened within the last week. It\u2019s something to keep our local clientele amused, and given that DC is, roughly speaking, 90% democratic, most of our cocktail names have that bent.\u201d\n\nStop into New Columbia on Saturdays for a light-hearted, boozy take on breaking political news with speciality cocktails like Don\u2019t Tarriff Me Bro, Gone with the Flynn, I Never Thought I\u2019d Miss Scalia, and Don\u2019t Be Russian to Conclusions.\n\nBy the Drinkers, For the Drinkers\n\n\n\nThe second distillery to open its doors in Ivy City, One Eight Distilling, creates vodka, gin, whiskey and experimental spirits. Their name is derived from Article One, Section Eight of the Constitution, which outlined the establishment of a District to serve as our nation\u2019s capital. According to their website, this connection to history and tradition informs One Eight\u2019s founding values of using local ingredients to \u201ccreate the bold flavors of our region for the people who take no shortcuts.\u201d\n\nEvery bottle of One Eight\u2019s District Made series features a textured map of Ivy City (Image via One Eight Distillery)\n\nLook out for a hidden map of DC, the flag\u2019s three stars and stripes down the sides of the bottle, and a textured map of Ivy City on the label of every bottle of District Made, One Eight\u2019s popular vodka.\n\n\n\nA Whiskey Fit for a Female President\n\n\n\nWhen Pia Carusone and Rachel Gardner opened Republic Restoratives in 2016, the first women-owned distillery in the District, it had inherent political ties. Carusone had worked in politics since graduating college: on the Hill, working campaigns, and finally, as an Obama appointee. Her latest role was as Congressman Gabrielle Giffords\u2019s Chief of Staff when tragedy struck and the Congresswoman was shot. Despite extracting herself from the professional world of politics, you can still find references to it in what she\u2019s created at Republic Restoratives.\n\nRepublic Restoratives\u2019 spirits features politically inclined names like \u201cCivic\u201d and \u201cRodham\u201d (Image via Republic Restoratives)\n\nThe \u201cRepublic\u201d part of the distillery\u2019s name is \u201ca nod to where we are and our community, a republic of people,\u201d says Sarah Mosbacher, their Business Manager. \u201cThe Restoratives part is a reference to how alcohol used to be prescribed by doctors to heal your ailments.\u201d\n\nTheir most direct political reference is in the name of their popular whiskey, Rodham Rye. \u201cThe concept behind Rodham Rye came from the anticipation for seeing our first female president be elected in the coming election cycle,\u201d says Mosbacher. \u201cThe morning after the election we realized that was no longer the case, but the concept was already fully hatched. It was decided that we should still honor the idea of a spirit to pay homage and respect to all of the great women leaders in our lives.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Anything the light touches in Washington, DC, is bound to be inextricably linked with politics, and the booze industry is no exception.
