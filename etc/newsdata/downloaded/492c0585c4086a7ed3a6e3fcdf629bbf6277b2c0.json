Craddock.\n\nSickly green light washed over the stubble and pale complexion of the man hunched in front of his computer monitor. Beside it sat a television, black except for five horizontal, crimson-colored bands running from top to bottom like lines on notebook paper.\n\nGarry Kitchen closed his eyes, but the straight red lines were burned into the backs of his eyelids. Behind him came a steady pounding: pound\u2014pound-pound-pound. He didn\u2019t rise to the bait. He knew what he\u2019d see. On the arcade cabinet\u2019s screen, a giant ape the size of King Kong had just scaled a construction site made of straight red girders. With every stomp, the platforms had twisted and bent until they were slanted like ramps. Standing tall at the top, the ape intoned his grating, mechanical laugh.\n\nKitchen gritted his teeth. His replica of the construction site was almost perfect. Steel girders, a flaming barrel, a little man in red-and-blue overalls, an ape at the top.\n\nThere was just one glaring, maddening difference. His platforms refused to bend. That was going to be a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarry Kitchen watched the success of Mattel\u2019s electronic games with interest. Just a few years ago he\u2019d been a college kid chasing an art degree and working part-time at Wickstead Design Associates, a firm that built consumer products like calculators and other digital electronics.\n\n\u201cI ended up getting involved in microprocessor engineering because I kind of had to,\u201d Kitchen recalled. \u201cDuring this time period, I'd switched from art in school to electrical engineering. I was learning engineering on the job, so why not finish my degree in engineering? We were a small company, I got dragged into doing work of a much higher caliber out of necessity. There was one guy who could, but he wasn't available.\u201d\n\nBy 1978, consumer electronics were evolving from handheld electronics to Atari\u2019s 2600 machine. While Atari had started out as the sole manufacturer of games for its console, Activision opened that December and developed games for personal computers and the 2600\u2014a tacit admission to developers everywhere that anyone could write games for Atari hardware. Kitchen went to his bosses at Wickstead Design Associates and made his case.\n\n\u201cLook, electronic toys are being hurt in the marketplace by video games,\u201d he said. They stared blankly. Video games? Kitchen pressed on: \u201cEverybody\u2019s jumping on this Atari thing. We should look into it.\u201d\n\nKitchen asked around and received little feedback. Atari couldn\u2019t stop Activision and other studios from making games for its device, but it didn\u2019t have to help. There was no software development kit, no prototype console designed to write and test code. Activision\u2019s founders only knew how to make games for the 2600 because they\u2019d worked with it while at the company.\n\nBy that time, Kitchen had flipped his schedule, working at WDA full-time and taking engineering classes at night. He wasn\u2019t making much money, pulling in $11,000 a year, but he enjoyed waking up every morning to solve new problems. Developing games for the 2600 was his latest and greatest challenge. Kitchen scraped together $1200 for an Apple II\u2014the most expensive of 1977\u2019s \u201choly trinity\u201d of personal computers, including the Commodore PET and Radio Shack TRS-80\u2014and dissected his new machine to learn its ins and outs. It ran on a 6502 8-bit processor, which he picked up on quickly having worked with microprocessors on electronic toys.\n\nOnce he wrote code, he knew he\u2019d have to find a way to put it on an Atari 2600 cartridge. His solution was a custom-made board with a chip he\u2019d soldered on to play Atari ROMs. Testing code required him to run a ribbon cable from the chip on his board to the teeth in the 2600\u2019s cartridge slot.\n\nSix months later, he\u2019d completely reverse-engineered the 2600 using his jerry-rigged setup and written a game, Space Jockey. The program weighed in at two kilobytes, four times the size of Mark Lesser\u2019s 511-byte handheld games, and was much more complex. A shooter, Space Jockey scrolled the screen to the right as the player shot down enemy ships. Kitchen took his creation to his bosses at WDA. He had daydreamed about Atari and Activision getting into a bidding war over Space Jockey, one of the first Atari games written outside either studio\u2019s walled garden. Instead, Donald Yu, one of his bosses, published it through US Games, a separate entity they\u2019d founded to publish electronic toys. Yu licensed Space Jockey to his company and prepared to put it on the market.\n\nBefore, when Atari had employed the only engineers capable of writing software for its console, games had appeared at a steady drip. The advent of Activision and engineers such as Kitchen increased the drip to a steady flow. Consumers, thirsty for new titles, lapped them up, but Garry Kitchen wouldn\u2019t see a penny from any sales of Space Jockey when it released. His bosses, as the game\u2019s publisher, would reap any rewards.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he said to Yu and the others, \u201cI should be making more money than $11,000.\u201d Bankshot and Space Jockey had become two of WDA\u2019s biggest products.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think you\u2019re worth that much,\u201d they replied.\n\nKitchen quit in early 1982. He didn\u2019t leave Wickstead Design Associates alone. His brother, Dan, went with him. They threw in with a couple of other engineers and set up shop in Garry\u2019s basement. Within a few hours of their first meeting, it resembled a mad scientist\u2019s lab.\n\nThe owner of the house Kitchen was renting had left the basement unfinished. Exposed pipes and wiring hung from the open ceiling. Several workbenches had been shoved against the walls, and the four engineers spread out, cluttering every surface with computers and other equipment. Everyone did their own thing. Some guys experimented with the Apple II. Others tinkered with Atari\u2019s 2600. As yet, no one had a contract to develop anything. They were just tooling around until something came up. Coleco was the first to offer up something.\n\nFounded in 1932 as the Connecticut Leather Company, Coleco pivoted to toys in the 1980s with Cabbage Patch Kids dolls. Now the owners were eyeing video games. Kitchen was confused when he received a call from a contract company offering him a deal with Coleco. \u201cWe have an in there,\u201d the recruiter said, and explained that word had gotten around about Kitchen\u2019s aptitude for programming 2600 software. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for somebody to do a port of Donkey Kong on the Atari. Are you interested?\u201d\n\nKitchen brightened. \u201cSure.\u201d", "description": "Garry Kitchen's unlikely story is told in this excerpt from the book Arcade Perfect.", "authors": ["David L.
