Its editor-at-large works there.", "language": "en", "text": "Bon App\u00e9tit magazine on Tuesday debuted its list of the 50 restaurants in the running to be named its top new restaurant of the year. Among the buzzy newcomers is Carpenters Hall in Austin, lauded as \u201ca way-more-than-a hotel restaurant\u201d that offers a \u201cplate-sized cutlet.\u201d\n\nImmediately, sharp-eyed readers identified the eatery as a venture associated with Andrew Knowlton, the former deputy editor of Bon App\u00e9tit who was a prominent face of the magazine for nearly two decades and for years was in charge of compiling the very list that now includes his own establishment. Knowlton, who stepped down from day-to-day work at the magazine last year, holds the title of editor-at-large.\n\nMembers of the food media quickly pounced, suggesting it was the kind of ethical breach that most news organizations take pains to avoid.\n\nbon app\u00e9tit editor-at-large andrew knowlton's restaurant is on bon app\u00e9tit's 50 best new restaurants, a list he was intimately involved with until this year https://t.co/JHzh2VECFK \u2014 Chris Crowley (@chrisecrowley) September 10, 2019\n\nThe magazine later appended an editor\u2019s note to the write-up (a spokeswoman said it was added about an hour after the initial publication). \u201c[Ed note: Andrew Knowlton, BA\u2019s editor-at-large, is involved in the restaurant]\u201d it reads.\n\nKnowlton and his wife, Christina Skogly Knowlton, were hired as food and beverage consultants for the restaurant and the group that owns it, the hotel where it is situated, and other properties.\n\nHanna Raskin, the president of the Association of Food Journalists, said the inclusion of a restaurant with which the magazine has a close relationship is a clear ethical no-no \u2014 even with a disclosure. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty traditional journalism ethics: Don\u2019t write about your friends,\u201d she said. The AFJ\u2019s ethics code warns members of the media against conflicts of interest and about giving special treatment to pals.\n\n[The key to White Claw\u2019s surging popularity: Marketing to a post-gender world]\n\nShe said that in her role as the food editor of the Post & Courier in Charleston, S.C., she considered Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s list \u201ctainted\u201d and would not write about it, something she might have done if not for the inclusion of Knowlton\u2019s restaurant.\n\nA Bon App\u00e9tit spokeswoman offered a fuller explanation of what she characterized as an arm\u2019s-length process by which Carpenters Hall made the list. Knowlton \u201cwas not involved\u201d in the creation of the list, she said in an interview with The Post. The decision to include his restaurant was made after Bon App\u00e9tit deputy editor Julia Kramer, who took over from Knowlton in spearheading the project, and other Bon App\u00e9tit editors dined there and determined it \u201cmet the criteria,\u201d she added. The magazine\u2019s editors evaluate restaurants around the country that have opened since May 2018 to find their top 10 favorites, a whittled-down list that will be announced next week.\n\nKnowlton said in an interview that he had \u201czero say\u201d in the list and that he doubted his involvement was a factor in the restaurant\u2019s selection. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s more of a validation of what the [Carpenters Hall] team has done than me being associated with it,\u201d he said. He said knew when Kramer and her colleagues were dining there but hadn\u2019t expected anything. (The Bon App\u00e9tit spokeswoman said she doesn\u2019t try to stay anonymous.)\n\nThe Bon App\u00e9tit spokeswoman suggested that it shouldn\u2019t come as a shock that the venture with which Knowlton was involved would earn a spot on a list he knew so well.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been compiling the list for 10 years, you have a pretty good idea of what makes a good restaurant,\u201d the spokeswoman added.\n\nKnowlton was not contacted about the list until after the story was published, the spokeswoman said, as was true, she said, for the 49 other listees. (Knowlton said that this was true and that he was \u201csurprised\u201d at the recognition.)\n\nFlagging the journalist-turned-restaurateur\u2019s connection in the editor\u2019s note was meant to provide transparency, the spokeswoman said, though she said she didn\u2019t know why the disclosure wasn\u2019t included initially. \u201cGiven that he\u2019s on the masthead, being transparent was the intention,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nDiners line up outside Bad Saint in 2016. The restaurant in Washington\u2019s Columbia Heights was boosted that year by its inclusion on Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s list of best new restaurants. (Goran Kosanovic for The Washington Post)\n\nSoleil Ho, the restaurant critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, says that readers could still feel \u201clike they\u2019re being played\u201d when they see the magazine touting an establishment run by an editor. Ho was one of the people who initially criticized the magazine on Twitter after the list was published.\n\n\u201cThen they should have explained all that,\u201d she said, when given the Bon App\u00e9tit spokeswoman\u2019s account. As a reader, \u201cif it wasn\u2019t an ethics breach, I would have wanted to know that. \u201d\n\nA spot on the list isn\u2019t just about bragging rights \u2014 it can be a huge financial boon for a young restaurant.\n\nGenevieve Villamora, whose Washington hotspot Bad Saint was named the second-best restaurant on Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s 2016 list, says the accolade immediately changed things for the then-fledgling restaurant. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way to overstate the effect that it can have on a restaurant,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can totally transform your trajectory \u2014 no matter how you were doing before, after is a totally different universe.\u201d\n\nAfter the list was published, she said, lines for the no-reservations restaurant almost immediately began snaking around the block. Villamora said she couldn\u2019t put a dollar figure on the impact but said the attention to the lists\u2019 new restaurants comes during their make-or-break infancy stage. \u201cFor a restaurant, those are the tough days when you are getting your reputation established \u2014 whatever experience people have with you in those early days is crucial.\u201d\n\nThree years after being featured in the magazine, Villamora partly credits that exposure with Bad Saint\u2019s success. \u201cIt put us on a different path than we would have been on. Of course, we\u2019ve had ups and downs, like any other business, but we\u2019ve been very steadily busy, and that is not the usual restaurant story,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we were in Bon App\u00e9tit, that has served as a buffer to what could have been more volatility.\u201d\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nAs the Impossible and Beyond burgers take off, will real veggie burgers go extinct?\n\nWe tried 13 popular potato chip brands, and our top and bottom picks just might surprise you", "description": "The magazine says the restaurant earned its spot on the list, but others see a breach of journalistic ethics.", "authors": ["Emily Heil", "Co-Author Of The Reliable Source", "September At Am", "Emily Heil Is A Reporter Covering National Food News", "Trends.
