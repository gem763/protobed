He was released on parole in 2011 and soon after formed UNPACU.\n\nFerrer's partner, Nelva Ismarays Ortega, said that during a visit Ferrer told her police threatened to charge him with a fabricated common crime so he would not be heralded as a political prisoner.\n\n\"They told him they were fed up with his activism ... and that they were very uncomfortable with how he'd supported the measures of the U.S. government against the Castro regime,\" Ortega told Reuters by phone.\n\nOrtega said authorities would not allow her to give Ferrer his medication for conditions such as the chronic gastroenteritis developed during his eight years in jail.\n\n\"He was in a lot of pain,\" she said. \"But he said he wasn't afraid, and he was prepared to spend more years in jail as long as the truth were known.\" Cuba's Communist government, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, does not discuss police activity such as the detention of dissidents, whom it dismisses as provocateurs financed by the United States.\n\nThe government regularly detains them for a few hours or days, in what rights activists describe as a long-running campaign of harassment and repression. But a detention of more than a week is unusual, especially for a prominent figure.\n\nCritics say the government appears to be tightening control, fearing unrest over deepening economic woes especially since internet service was expanded, increasing access to information and the ability to mobilize.
