PRECIOUS-Gold rises as dollar, stocks ease ahead of U.S.-China talks\n\n* China-U.S. trade talks on Oct 10-11\n\n* FOMC minutes due at 1800 GMT on Wednesday\n\n\n\n(Updates prices, adds comments and details)\n\nBy Sumita Layek\n\nOct 8 (Reuters) - Gold firmed on Tuesday after touching a\n\nnear one-week low, as the dollar eased and European stocks moved\n\nlower ahead of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve and\n\nscheduled trade talks between Washington and Beijing.\n\nSpot gold rose 0.5% to $1,500.35 per ounce, as of\n\n0931 GMT. Prices had dropped as much as 1% in the previous\n\nsession.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 were up 0.1% at $1,505.90 per\n\nounce.\n\n\"Gold seems to be relatively stable at the moment and that\n\nhas a lot to do with the fact we are in a fragile risk\n\nenvironment,\" said OANDA senior market analyst Craig Erlam.\n\nEuropean shares turned gave up early gains as prospects for\n\nprogress in U.S.-China trade talks looked less likely after\n\nWashington blacklisted Chinese companies over Beijing's\n\ntreatment of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. .EU\n\n\n\n\"If we do see a full collapse (in trade talks) unexpectedly,\n\nthat will lead to a lot of risk aversion which could be the\n\nbullish catalyst gold needs,\" Erlam said, adding that there was\n\na lot of uncertainty over the Fed minutes as well.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. Trade Representative\n\nRobert Lighthizer are set to resume top-level trade talks on\n\nThursday, ahead of a scheduled increase in U.S. tariffs on $250\n\nbillion worth of Chinese goods on Oct. 15. Market participants are also awaiting the U.S. Federal Open\n\nMarket Committee's minutes from its September meeting on\n\nWednesday for clues on whether the Fed will cut rates at its\n\nOctober meeting in what could be its third interest rate cut for\n\nthe year.\n\nLower interest rates tend to increase investor interest in\n\nnon-yielding gold.\n\nGold also drew support from the dollar, with the dollar\n\nindex shedding overnight gains against rivals. A weaker\n\nU.S. currency makes dollar-denominated gold less expensive for\n\nholders of other currencies.\n\n\"Gold ETFs (exchange-traded fund) are close to the highest\n\nin years, so there definitely is demand for gold because of\n\ntrade tensions and the slowdown in general in global growth\n\nrates,\" said SP Angel analyst Sergey Raevskiy.\n\nHoldings of the world's largest gold-backed ETF, SPDR Gold\n\nShares , held close to their highest in nearly three years\n\nat about 923.76 tonnes. GOL/ETF\n\nHowever, \"gold is going to be rangebound until there is any\n\nunderstanding of how the (U.S.-China trade) meeting went,\"\n\nRaevskiy added.\n\nAmong other precious metals, silver gained 0.4% to\n\n$17.51 an ounce, while platinum XPT= rose 0.4% at $880.16 and\n\npalladium XPD= fell 0.7% at $1,647.86.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold rises as dollar, stocks ease ahead of U.S.-China talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC4I11E_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
