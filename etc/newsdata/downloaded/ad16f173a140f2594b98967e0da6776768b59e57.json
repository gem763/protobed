Recent British productions have included a giant 18th century dolls\u2019 house at Covent Garden, Garsington\u2019s elegant Twenties Parisian caf\u00e9, and Holland Park\u2019s Casa del Fish\u2019n\u2019Chips on a windswept Clacton promenade.\n\nNow we have Damiano Michieletto\u2019s Sixties take, in a house with no walls but a surfeit of furniture, and doors which permit Donizetti\u2019s games of domestic hide and seek. There are just five (plus chorus) in the cast, but Michieletto peoples his stage with dozens of non-singing extras plus puppets galore; Pasquale\u2019s silent maid is a sub-plot in herself, so prominently is she woven into the action.\n\nThe plot is based on a staple opera buffa idea. Portly old Pasquale decides to marry beautiful young Norina who is in love with his nephew Ernesto, but family-friend Dr Malatesta sets up a deception: Norina will indeed marry Pasquale, and will lead him such a dance, as well as impoverishing him with demands for a ruinously expensive make-over of the house, that he will plead to be shot of her, thus allowing the young lovers to wander off happily into the sunset.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMichieletto has given himself licence to time-travel and dream. For Norina\u2019s signature aria \u2013 a hymn to her own coquetry \u2013 she is transformed into a make-up artist on a fashion-shoot, with the stage becoming a giant video-screen onto which she is projected in close-up; the same technique is used to project the lovers in their climactic duet. But there are times when Michieletto\u2019s tinkerings are simply distracting, and we lose that sense of a claustrophobic world which is essential to the comedy. And it\u2019s a very mean comedy: Pasquale is set up for ridicule from the start, with everyone ranged against him. We are expected to enjoy his protracted humiliation, and even \u2013 in Michieletto\u2019s gratuitously sadistic final touch \u2013 his eventual confinement to a wheelchair. Ho bloody ho.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The 27 best opening lines in books Show all 27 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

Ioan Hotea\u2019s sweetly sung Ernesto may suffer from slightly wonky intonation, but Markus Werba\u2019s Malatesta is smartly on-the-button throughout, and Olga Peretyatko\u2019s Norina offers a fine blend of vocal beauty and comic timing. Bryn Terfel\u2019s Pasquale \u2013 at first stumbling and self-important, then pathetically impotent \u2013 is a brilliant creation, more sympathetically imagined than any character he has incarnated thus far in his career.", "description": "Gaetano Donizetti wanted his late masterpiece Don Pasquale \u2013\u00a0premiered in Paris in 1843 \u2013 to look bang up to date, and throughout its glittering afterlife directors have played fast and loose with its place and period.", "authors": ["Michael Church"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/19/12/191012-0864-bryn-terfel-as-don-pasquale-c-roh-2019-photograph-by-clive-barda.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
