And among those not yet retired, 32 per cent regret not saving enough more generally, and 12 per cent that they sat on too much cash instead of investing it.\n\nLifestyle goals: Having more time for friends and family is one of the priorities for retirement\n\nWhen it comes to the generational divide, 51 per cent said younger generations have a tougher time financially than they did, and 29 per cent thought the opposite.\n\nBut 66 per cent of those without a final salary pension - which provides a guaranteed income in old age - have a vague or no idea about what their income in retirement will be, compared with 44 per cent of those who have one.\n\nParticipants in the Interactive Investor survey included its customers, readers of its money publications and visitors to its website. II says they were skewed towards the better off - its customers have an average of \u00a3100,000 available to invest.", "description": "The results of a mammoth study of retirement attitudes among mostly well-to-do savers reflect the major behavioural shift towards people investing their pensions to provide an income in old age.", "authors": ["Tanya Jefferies For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
