Robert Harris\u2019s latest, The Second Sleep, is a work of speculative fiction set in Britain 800 years into the future, after a \u201csystemic collapse of technical civilisation\u201d known as the Apocalypse. Into the void of the \u201cDark Age\u201d steps a rejuvenated and dogmatic church, whose authoritarian rule and obsessive suppression of heretical \u201cscientism\u201d ensure that people live in brutal and backward conditions.\n\nHarris\u2019s book kept calling me back to a neglected classic of alternative history, Keith Roberts\u2019s Pavane. That collection of linked stories imagines the assassination of Elizabeth I, the continued primacy of the Catholic Church and the failure of the Enlightenment. Under the pope in Pavane, the world exists in a feudal state with an interdiction on innovation.\n\nLike Pavane (and, for that matter, like Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, with which The Second Sleep is also in dialogue), Harris\u2019s bleak imagined world issues a clarion call to the present, urging us to recognise the value of progress, the importance of woolly concepts like liberalism and the rule of law, and all the other ideals we\u2019ve spent generations fighting for yet seem prepared to sacrifice on the altar of populism. For make no mistake, this novel may be set in a Wessex that\u2019s at once futuristic and quasi-medieval, but it\u2019s very much about the here and now, about Trump and Brexit and the Govian rejection of experts.\n\nChristopher Fairfax is a newly ordained priest who serves under the sinister Bishop Pole of Exeter. He has been sent to a village, Addicott St George, deep in a valley often cut off by the violent storms that beset this future England. The vicar of the village, Father Lacy, has recently died, and Pole has dispatched Fairfax to bury the old priest.\n\nRobert Harris: 'Whenever a crowd is running one way, I run the other' Read more\n\nHarris is a master of plotting and, in elegant, understated third-person prose, he ratchets the tension ever upwards. A mysterious figure appears at Lacy\u2019s funeral, casting doubt on the accidental nature of the priest\u2019s death. There is a strange tower in the woods \u2013 the Devil\u2019s Chair \u2013 around which human bones are discovered. There\u2019s the Proceedings and Papers of the Society of Antiquaries, the records of a heretical movement. There\u2019s a letter from a Prof Morgenstern, winner of the 1999 Nobel prize for \u201cphysic\u201d, which notes that in the pre-Apocalyptic past \u201cLondon existed at any moment only six meals removed from starvation\u201d and that \u201csociety has reached a level of sophistication that renders it uniquely vulnerable to total collapse\u201d. Sure enough, the Apocalypse hits in 2025, with thousands dying from previously preventable diseases, and more killed in brutal internecine wars.\n\nThere\u2019s the echo of Harris\u2019s earlier Cicero Trilogy in the message of The Second Sleep: \u201cAll civilisations consider themselves invulnerable; history warns us that none is.\u201d\n\nAs Harris\u2019s plot moves towards its pleasingly bombastic ending, Fairfax\u2019s faith is put to the test. The swiftness with which the priest overthrows his worldview feels slightly hurried, but then this is nothing if not a page-turner.\n\nThe title of the book refers to the once common practice of having a period of wakefulness in the middle of the night, before returning to bed. It\u2019s a powerful image that posits the current climate, in which much of the country enjoys relative health, wealth and freedom from outdated superstitions, as a brief, lucid window between two long stretches of darkness.\n\n\u2022 The Second Sleep by Robert Harris is published by Hutchinson (\u00a320).
