Esper emphasized the Pentagon\u2019s role in protecting the U.S. electoral process from ongoing attacks as the 2020 presidential contest approaches.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, I consider election security an enduring mission for the Department of Defense,\u201d Mr. Esper said Thursday during an event in Maryland, multiple outlets reported. \u201cOur adversaries will continue to target our democratic processes. This is a reality of the world we live in today. Guarding against these threats requires constant vigilance.\n\n\u201cOur adversaries are attempting to harm our economic prosperity and to undermine our democratic institutions. Influence operations against the American public are now possible at a scope and scale never before imagined,\u201d Mr. Esper said. \u201cThe Department of Defense has an important role in defending the American people from this misinformation, particularly as it pertains to preserving the integrity of our democratic elections.\u201d\n\nMr. Esper, a former Raytheon executive, previously served as secretary of the Army prior to being appointed by President Trump in June to succeed Jim Mattis as the administration\u2019s top defense official.\n\nSpeaking at the second annual National Cybersecurity Summit in National Harbor, Mr. Esper reportedly said that several changes made after the 2016 U.S. presidential election was attacked have put the Pentagon in a better position to handle any efforts to interfere in next year\u2019s race.\n\nMr. Esper cited three factors that he credited with successfully defending the 2018 midterm elections, the Fifth Domain cybersecurity news site reported: greater cooperation among federal agencies, advancements in the Pentagon\u2019s cyber capabilities and a classified directive issued last year by Mr. Trump \u2014 the National Security Presidential Memorandum 13, or NSPM 13 \u2013 that authorized the military to take a more offensive stance toward countering cyber threats than before.\n\n\u201cBy defending forward, we are able to see and understand malicious cyber behavior, allowing us to publicly expose that activity and its culprits. It\u2019s also posturing us to take action against these threats, at their source, before they reach the homeland,\u201d Mr. Esper said, Fifth Domain reported.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is we are now prepared to deliver the actions expected from the department in a timely, collaborative and risk-informed manner,\u201d he added, according to the site.\n\nAmerican intelligence agencies previously concluded that 2016 presidential race was targeted by Russian state-sponsored hackers and professional internet \u201ctrolls\u201d who waged cyberattacks against elements of the U.S. voting infrastructure and weaponized social media platforms to spread political misinformation and propaganda, respectively. Moscow has denied responsibility.\n\nThe Pentagon previously relied on NSPM 13 to prevent Russian trolls from getting online during the 2018 midterms, The Washington Post previously reported.\n\n\u201cThe passage of NSPM-13 gave us the authorities needed to more fully employ our cyber capabilities in an offensive manner,\u201d Mr. Esper said at the summit Thursday, Fifth Domain reported. \u201cThis policy reflects a shared understanding of the need to maximize the effectiveness of the department\u2019s cyber warriors.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
