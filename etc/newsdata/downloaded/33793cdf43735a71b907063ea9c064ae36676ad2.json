He allowed three earned runs and struck out three batters in what was his 15th start of the season.\n\nCHICAGO CUBS' MARK LORETTA SUSPENDED FOR PUTTING ON UMPIRE'S HEADSET DURING REVIEW\n\nAs manager Scott Servais took the ball from Hernandez, the fireballer received a standing ovation from the fans he dazzled for more than a decade.

He still had a job to do.\n\n\u201cI was walking to the bullpen and my eyes started to [get] wet and I was like, 'Not right now.'
