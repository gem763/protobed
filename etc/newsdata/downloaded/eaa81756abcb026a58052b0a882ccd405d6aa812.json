In May, Trump angrily walked out of a planned White House meeting with Pelosi, Schumer and other top Democrats over a proposed $2 trillion infrastructure package after release of the Mueller report.\n\nThe new chapter in their feud had Pelosi and other top Democrats exiting a White House meeting Wednesday complaining Trump resorted to name-calling and personal insults. Their departure abruptly ended an attempt by congressional leaders in both parties to discuss Trump's troop withdrawal from northern Syria.\n\nDuring the latest session, Trump laced into Pelosi, launching into a \u201cnasty diatribe\u201d that culminated in him calling her a \u201cthird-rate politician,\u201d according to Schumer.\n\nPelosi shot back after the meeting, saying Trump had a \u201cmeltdown\u201d and was \u201crattled\u201d by the House\u2019s overwhelming bipartisan vote earlier Wednesday to condemn the president\u2019s actions in Syria.\n\nTrump later countered in a series of tweets that it was in fact Pelosi who had a \"a total meltdown,\" adding, \"Nancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her 'upstairs,' or she just plain doesn\u2019t like our great Country.\"\n\nTrump also tweeted a photo of the meeting with the caption, \"Nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown!\" Pelosi apparently didn't mind the picture; she made it part of her Twitter profile.\n\nAccording to Democrats, Trump began Wednesday's meeting with a \"lengthy monologue\" on Syria, and then \"bragged about his 'nasty' letter\" to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, which the White House released afterward. Trump even distributed copies of the letter at the meeting.\n\nAt one point, \"Trump suggested that there were communists in Syria and said Democrats would like that,\" said a senior Democratic aide, although lawmakers said that comment was related to the Kurds.\n\nPelosi responded that Russia has always wanted a \"foothold in the Middle East,\" and blamed Trump for now giving one to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"All roads with you lead to Putin,\" Pelosi declared, a Democratic aide said.\n\nTrump later told Pelosi, \"I hate ISIS more than you do,\" to which Pelosi replied, \"You don't know that.\"\n\nDuring one exchange, Trump blamed former President Barack Obama for the mess in Syria, although part of his insult was aimed at Pelosi, too.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) then jumped in to back Pelosi: \"This is not useful.\"\n\nAs Trump took aim at her, Pelosi stood up to go. She began to sit back down until Hoyer suggested that Democrats should leave, according to a Democratic source familiar with the meeting.\n\nThe two top House Democrats then left, followed shortly after by Schumer, who had briefly stayed behind to press Defense Secretary Mark Esper about the fate of ISIS prisoners in Syria.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham disputed the Democrats' portrayal of events, tweeting that Trump was \"measured & decisive\" while Pelosi's decision to walk out was \"baffling.\"\n\n\"Dem 'leadership' chose to storm out & whine to cameras, everyone else stayed to work on behalf of our country,\" Grisham added.\n\nRepublican lawmakers said Trump spoke with several other Democrats who remained in the room after their leaders left.\n\nTrump had one last shot for Democrats as they left. \"Goodbye, we'll see you at the polls,\" Trump said, according to multiple sources in the room.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we couldn't continue in the meeting, because he was just not relating to the reality of it,\u201d Pelosi told reporters outside the White House, flanked by Schumer and Hoyer. \u201cI think the president was very shaken up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have served with six presidents, I have been in many, many meetings like this, never have I seen a president treat so disrespectfully a coequal branch of the government of the United States,\u201d Hoyer added, calling the president\u2019s words \u201coffensive.\u201d\n\nDuring the meeting, Trump also insulted Mattis, calling him \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general\u201d and insisted, without evidence, that the ISIS fighters who escaped from Syria in recent days were the \u201cleast dangerous.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s policy on Syria this month has triggered a bipartisan blowback unlike anything else in his presidency. Trump only seemed to further fuel his political mess on Wednesday by going after U.S. allied-Kurdish fighters, saying they were not \u201cangels.\u201d\n\nThat comment drew a rare rebuke from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who touted Kurdish support in fighting the Islamic State.\n\nDemocratic leaders also complained that Trump and his advisers were unable to answer any questions on the substance of the U.S. policy in Syria going forward, including the fate of ISIS prisoners who had been in Kurdish custody.\n\nTrump suggested to reporters earlier in the day that Turkish and Syrian officials would take over responsibility for them.\n\n\u201cI asked the president what his plan was to contain ISIS. He didn\u2019t really have one,\u201d Schumer said, visibly angry outside the White House. \u201cThis is appalling.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d7/36/9fa99f6b447697c8a70179c561ef/191016-pelosi-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
