REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw/File Photo\n\nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - More than 40 flights were delayed and a dozen cancelled at Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol airport on Wednesday, as KLM ground crews went on strike.\n\nA spokesman for KLM, a subsidiary of Air France-KLM, said the airline had cancelled 6 flights as a result of the strike. Other delays and cancellations were due to poor weather and repairs, making landing strips unavailable.\n\nA spokeswoman for Schiphol said that the cancellations were among KLM and allied \u201cSkypartners\u201d airlines.\n\nThe airport\u2019s website showed most cancellations were for outgoing KLM flights. Most incoming flights of all airlines were delayed by about an hour, with disruptions set to continue until mid-afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe have tried to allow as many flights as possible to go ahead, despite the strike, for passengers willing to travel with hand baggage only,\u201d KLM spokesman Koen van Zijl said.\n\nThe strike, the second of its kind this week, was scheduled to last through the morning rush hour, from 0530 until 0800 GMT.\n\nKLM plans talks later this week after unions seeking an 8% pay increase over 2 years rejected a proposal by the Dutch airline for a 6-7% rise over three years.", "description": "More than 40 flights were delayed and a dozen cancelled at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on Wednesday, as KLM ground crews went on strike.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426043363&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830I5"}
