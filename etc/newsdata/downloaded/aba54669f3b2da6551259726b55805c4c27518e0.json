We can go over here to [the county jail] and get better people out of there than those running for Democratic, to be president of the United States,\u201d he said, according to a video captured by CBS affiliate WVLT. \u201cWe got a queer running for president, if that ain\u2019t about as ugly as you can get.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHurst\u2019s comment referring to openly gay Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg was well-received by those in the meeting, drawing laughter and applause. He then went on to lament the plight of (presumably straight) white men in the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not prejudiced, but by golly, a white male in this country has very few rights, and they\u2019re getting took more every day,\u201d Hurst added. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear them stand on the stage and say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m for the poor and the black.\u2019 You never heard one of them say, \u2018I believe white people have rights, too.\u2019\u201d\n\nHurst has been criticized by those who consider his worldview and statements homophobic, racist and sexist. Officials from GLAAD, an organization that advocates for gay rights, called Hurst\u2019s comments \u201ccompletely unacceptable and ridiculous.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nChris Sanders, executive director of the Tennessee Equality Project, which advocates for LGBTQ rights in the state, told The Washington Post\u2019s Michael Brice-Saddler that Hurst should resign.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere may be ways for him to make up for what he said, but they have to be concrete. We\u2019re beyond an apology at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to see some real change backed up by public policy in that county.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the pushback, Hurst\u2019s views are shared by many of those in his party who looked to Trump to return the United States to a period when women, people of color and LGBT Americans had fewer rights.\n\nThe 2018 midterm election was trumpeted as a high point in American politics due to the increase in women and gay Americans who won their races. But not all voters deemed this change as worthy of celebration.\n\nAD\n\nA majority of Republicans \u2014 65 percent \u2014 believe that society has become too feminine and soft, according to the latest Public Religion Research Institute survey. More than half of Republicans \u2014 53 percent \u2014 believe that men are punished just for being men.\n\nAD\n\nAnd following the presidency of the United States\u2019 first black president, most Republicans view discrimination against white people as significant of a problem as anti-black racism. Nearly 7 in 10 Republicans \u2014 69 percent \u2014 say that discrimination against white people is now as much of a problem as discrimination against black people. More than 60 percent \u2014 63 percent \u2014 of these Republicans believe that immigrants are invading the country while changing American culture.\n\nAll of these percentages are significantly higher for Americans who are white, over age 65 and who cite Fox News as their primary source of news.\n\nAD\n\nHurst is a political leader in a state where conservatives and the GOP enjoy widespread support. Republicans overwhelmingly control the governor\u2019s mansion, both chambers of the legislature and most congressional seats. However, these wins are not enough for many conservatives to feel like winners \u2014 especially when it comes to the culture wars over issues of race, gender and sexuality.\n\nIt is this anxiety, fear and dissatisfaction that will be a leading factor in these individuals support for Trump, a president who has often presented himself as the leader of current cultural battles. As long as diversifying the demographics of individuals who have a seat at political tables continues, Americans such as Hurst will view the country as moving further away from its greatest days.\n\nAD", "description": "A conservative lawmaker continues to voice a concern many in his party hold closely.", "authors": ["Eugene Scott", "Reporter Covering Identity Politics For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/74USKUEGXFxz0z1xzGb7vJjaEjw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HCMXHJXLZZGQTJUJSN7N3NEPYA.PNG", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
