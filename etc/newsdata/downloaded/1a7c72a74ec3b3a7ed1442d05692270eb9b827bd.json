Political ads also must include a \"paid for by\" disclosure and may not be paid for by non-resident foreign nationals.\n\nDipayan Ghosh, a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy as well as a former privacy and public policy adviser at Facebook, told ABC News in a statement that this is a \"critical development for a platform that has become increasingly important in American media.\"\n\n\"Though this is a positive step forward, we must demand better political ad transparency of Snap,\" he added. \"Clear disclaimers identifying political content to users, real time disclosures of engagement statistics, a searchable online database, better visualizations of historical ad creatives, and granular information about ad targeting and audience segmentation are all vital given Snapchat's increasing importance.\"\n\nGhosh added that if tech giants and the broader internet industry \"fail to offer such transparency, our democratic process will remain vulnerable to disinformation operations.\"\n\nThomas White/Reuters, FILE\n\nSnapchat's effort comes on the heels of Facebook announcing it was also tightening its rules surrounding political ads ahead of the 2020 election, forcing advertisers to confirm their group's identity using a tax identification number (or other government ID) and including \"paid for by\" disclaimers, according to the Associated Press.\n\nCritics, however, were quick to point out a loophole in Facebook's efforts that smaller groups could use if they don't have a tax ID, government website or registration with the FTC.", "description": "Snapchat users can now find out who paid for the political ads they see within the app.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/snapchat-gty-er-181114_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
