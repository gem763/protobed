Previous agreements have been multi-year deals.Washington is seen to be pressuring Seoul to pay nearly $5 billion a year, as much as fivefold the current amount, and there is not a lot of time to negotiate as the two sides aim to seal a deal by the end of the year.Under the 10th SMA, Seoul agreed to pay nearly 1.04 trillion won ($888.6 million) this year, which was 8.2 percent more than what Korea spent the previous year for the stationing of 28,500 U.S. troops.The U.S. State Department has been demanding a \u201cfair and equitable\u201d outcome to the negotiations.U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Harry Harris said in an interview with the Dong-A Ilbo earlier this month that Korea pays \u201conly one-fifth\u201d of the total cost of defense and should be paying a larger share as the world\u2019s 12th largest economy.\u201cThere can be no free riders to our shared security,\u201d U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Thursday at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels, on the same days as the SMA talks in Honolulu.\u201cRegardless of geographic location, size, or population, all must do their part to deter war and defend the alliance. We are only as strong as the investments we are willing to make towards our common defense.\u201dWhile Esper was addressing NATO countries, he stressed every ally \u201cmust contribute its fair share to ensure our mutual security and uphold the international rules-based order.\u201dBruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the U.S.-based RAND Corporation pointed out that Washington demanding a significant increase in Seoul\u2019s share in stationing U.S. troops in Korea would backfire and reduce its budget for purchases of American weapons as the funds would come out of its Defense Ministry\u2019s Development and Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), reported the Voice of America (VOA) Thursday.\u201cSo fundamentally, what the U.S. is asking South Korea to do is to reduce the South Korean purchases of American weapons systems,\u201d Bennett was quoted as saying by VOA, adding U.S. arms manufacturers will \u201cactually lose purchases that have been planned if there\u2019s a significant increase in the burden-sharing.\u201dBY SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
