Police said they had detained one person.\n\nRegional broadcaster MDR said the lives of two people who were seriously injured were no longer in danger.\n\nThe video circulating online showed a young man with a shaven head reciting a short statement in broken English to a camera while sitting in a parked car.\n\n\u201cI think the Holocaust never happened,\u201d he began, before adding \u201cfeminism is the cause of decline in birth rates in the West\u201d, mentioning mass immigration and concluding: \u201cThe root of all these problems is the Jew.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Amazon\u2019s (AMZN.O) video streaming subsidiary Twitch said footage of the shooting attack was livestreamed on the service.\n\n\u201cWe worked with urgency to remove this content and will permanently suspend any accounts found to be posting or reposting content of this abhorrent act,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the video, the man drove to the synagogue, found the gates shut, swore, and after failing to force the gates open, shot several rounds into a woman passer-by.\n\nGerman magazines Spiegel and Focus Online reported that the suspect was a 27-year old German.\n\nInterior Minister Horst Seehofer said the shooting was anti-Semitic, adding: \u201cAccording to the federal prosecutors\u2019 office, there are enough indications that it was possibly a right-wing extremist motive.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the Halle municipal government said one shooting took place in front of the synagogue on Humboldt street and its accompanying cemetery, while a second burst of gunfire targeted the kebab shop in the eastern German city.\n\nMax Privorozki, Halle\u2019s Jewish community chairman, described how the gunman tried to shoot his way into the synagogue.\n\n\u201cWe saw via the camera system at our synagogue that a heavily armed perpetrator with a steel helmet and a gun tried to shoot open our doors,\u201d he told the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper. \u201cThe man looked like he was from the special forces ... But our doors held.\u201d\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel attends a gathering at the New Synagogue in Berlin, Germany, October 9, 2019, after two people were killed in a shooting in the eastern German city of Halle.

Around 200,000 Jews live today in the country of around 83 million people.\n\nRifat Tekin, who worked at the kebab outlet, said he was making a kebab for two construction workers when a perpetrator threw an explosive at the restaurant before shooting.\n\n\u201cHe was very calm, like a professional,\u201d Tekin told n-tv television. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything. He just kept coming and shooting ... I was hiding behind the salad counter.\u201d\n\nAnother witness, Conrad Roesler, said that when the attacker started firing at the restaurant, \u201cI hid in the toilet.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (27 Images)\n\nBroadcasters showed images of the alleged perpetrator dressed in combat garb including a helmet.\n\nIn Berlin, politicians advised police to step up security at Jewish institutions in the capital.\n\nDespite comprehensive de-Nazification in the post-war era, fears of resurgent anti-Semitic hatred have never completely gone away, whether from fringe, far-right neo-Nazis or more recently from Muslim immigrants.\n\nOccasional past attacks have ranged from the scrawling of Nazi swastikas on gravestones to firebombings at synagogues and even several murders. In recent years, cases of assault or verbal abuse, in some cases directed against people wearing traditional Jewish skullcaps, have raised an outcry.", "description": "A gunman killed two people in a synagogue and a nearby kebab shop on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year, in an attack in the German city of Halle that he livestreamed on a video-gaming platform.", "authors": ["Thomas Escritt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438948502&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981T8", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
