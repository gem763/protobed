He has \"called off\" the talks and asserted that a planned secret meeting between him and Taliban leaders at Camp David, set for Sunday just days before the 9/11 anniversary, is now canceled. Some question whether it was a face-saving attempt after the deal his envoy said had been reached \"in principle\" faced serious challenges.\n\nThe Taliban took half a day to respond, saying the abrupt decision hurt U.S. credibility after they had \"finalized\" a deal, but said the U.S. likely would return to negotiations. The two sides had still been talking on Saturday, they said \u2014 two days after Trump said he had \"immediately\" called off talks.\n\nHere's a look at the push for a deal that Trump had wanted quickly, calling it \"ridiculous\" that the U.S. was still in Afghanistan after nearly 18 years and billions of dollars spent.\n\nThe Taliban, who ruled Afghanistan with a harsh version of Islamic law from 1996 to 2001 and hosted Osama bin Laden as he masterminded the 9/11 attacks, say they no longer seek a monopoly on power. But the militant group now controls or holds sway over roughly half of the country. Many fear a full withdrawal of some 20,000 NATO troops would leave the weak and corrupt Afghan government vulnerable to collapse, or unleash another round of fighting in a war that has killed tens of thousands.\n\nA DEAL WITH FEW DETAILS\n\nThe talks between Afghan-born U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban leaders in Qatar, where the insurgent group has a political office, have been so closely guarded that last week Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was shown \u2014 not given \u2014 the final draft. The Afghan government has been sidelined because the Taliban refuse to negotiate with what they call a U.S. puppet.\n\nThe Taliban negotiators have been led by Abdul Ghani Baradar, one of the group's founders who was released by Pakistan last year after eight years in prison, apparently upon a U.S. request. He is believed to command enough respect to sell a deal to tens of thousands of fighters.\n\nThe deal once final would begin a U.S. troop withdrawal with the first 5,000 leaving within 135 days, Khalilzad announced on Monday. That would leave 8,600 troops who train and support Afghan forces after their combat role ended in 2014. In return, the Taliban would guarantee that Afghanistan would not be a launching pad for global terror attacks by groups including a local affiliate of the Islamic State organization and the remains of al-Qaida.\n\nBut problems quickly emerged. Even as Khalilzad explained the deal to the Afghan people during a nationally televised interview, the Taliban detonated a car bomb targeting a foreign compound in Kabul. Ghani's office then raised loud objections, agreeing with several former U.S. ambassadors who warned that a hasty U.S. withdrawal without Taliban guarantees on ending violence could lead to \"total civil war.\" Far from guaranteeing a ceasefire, the deal includes only a reduction in violence in Kabul and neighboring Parwan province, where the U.S. has a military base.\n\nThen on Thursday, a second Taliban car bomb exploded in Kabul and killed 12 people including a U.S. service member \u2014 which Trump blamed for his decision to cancel the talks. Khalilzad abruptly returned to Qatar for at least two days of negotiations. The new Taliban statement does not explain what happened next.\n\nMore than 2,400 U.S. service members have been killed in nearly 18 years of fighting in Afghanistan, and some observers are asking why the latest death would derail the U.S.-Taliban negotiations on the apparent brink of a deal. The Taliban have said the attacks strengthen their negotiating position.\n\n\"A difficulty created by announcing that the U.S.-Taliban deal was completed in advance of actually announcing the terms of the deal or being ready to sign is that space has been created for those unhappy with it \u2014 in Kabul or Washington \u2014 to try to modify or disrupt it,\" Laurel Miller, Asia director for the International Crisis Group, said shortly before Trump's announcement.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NOW?\n\nIt is not clear. It seems no one had anticipated a Camp David meeting between Trump and the leaders of an insurgent group that just months ago Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had described as \"Taliban terrorists.\"", "description": "With a series of tweets, President Donald Trump has upended nearly a year of U.S.-Taliban negotiations on ending America's longest war.
