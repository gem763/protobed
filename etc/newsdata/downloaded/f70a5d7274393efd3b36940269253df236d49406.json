It\u2019s also exactly the kind of thing French Fleabag would say. What Cottin delivers, though, is by no means a tribute act to Waller-Bridge. To call her elegant would be insufficient. Cottin has a whole munitions depot of self-possession and chicness that gives her performance a more knowing, and also more mournful, edge. At 40, she\u2019s older than Waller-Bridge was, but she doesn\u2019t have more maturity \u2013 just less goofiness.\n\nTalking about the role, Cottin instinctively amplifies its desperation over its comedy: \u201cFleabag is completely emancipated but, at the same time, she\u2019s a slave to her impulses, she\u2019s not free at all. It leads her to destruction. She knows it and she can\u2019t stop. All there is that way is addiction and death.\u201d\n\nFrance is not accustomed to dark comedy. Everybody calls me and says: 'This is really hard to watch'\n\nAnd that\u2019s nothing to how audiences on the other side of the Channel have taken to it. \u201cFrance is not accustomed to dark comedy. Everybody calls me and says, \u2018This is really hard to watch. Now you\u2019ve made me depressed.\u2019 Everybody reacts to the darkness rather than the comedy. And they are shocked by the role in terms of sexuality. They all told me, \u2018You have to have bollocks to do this.\u2019 No, bollocks is not correct. \u2018You have to have balls to do this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe actor spent her teenage years in London, hence her easy navigation of the exact right word. But her professional life has been lived almost entirely on the French stage. \u201cIt was really a do-it-yourself scene. You\u2019d find a small theatre, 30 seats. They were never filled, but those five or six people really lost themselves.\u201d\n\nShe was well regarded but little enough known that when her breakthrough show, Connasse, came out in 2013, viewers struggled to understand exactly what they were watching: a prank TV show, an edgier Trigger Happy TV. \u201cConnasse means bitch \u2013 it\u2019s quite hard. Because it was hidden cameras, people didn\u2019t know at all that I was an actress, that I\u2019d been an actress for 15 years. Everybody, even in the industry, thought I was like that, that I was really a bitch. I thought it was clear it was a character, not even a real character, basically a clown. But when I met people in the industry, they\u2019d say \u2018Hello\u2019 in the manner of, \u2018Don\u2019t try any of your shit with me.\u2019 And I was so surprised. Because I\u2019m nice.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Range \u2026 Cottin in Call My Agent (Dix Pour Cent) on Netflix. Photograph: France 2/Netflix\n\nThe timing of her next TV show, Call My Agent, was fortuitous: with the benefit of subtitles and Netflix distribution, Cottin reached an international audience for the first time \u2013 unless you count her role in 2016\u2019s second world war film Allied, with Brad Pitt, of which she mourns: \u201cMy hair! I was so happy, I was in Hollywood. Then at the last minute, they spent hours making me look like Marge Simpson.\u201d\n\nCall My Agent, about a talent agency, has been a fantastic calling card, illustrating how much greater Cottin\u2019s range was than \u201cclown\u201d. It generated a lot of discussion, partly by being great, and partly because it was, as she says, the first prime-time French drama to feature a lesbian whose \u201chomosexuality was not the subject. The subject is how it is hard for her to commit to a relationship, because what she likes is the act of seduction. The fact that she likes women is completely accepted.\u201d\n\nCottin plays one of four showbiz agents, variously betraying, bolstering, spying on and supporting one another, while dealing with the carousel of egos that is their clientele. The fact that Cottin stands out is extraordinary, firstly because the core cast is magnetic, and secondly because the cameos are gobsmacking \u2013 from Isabelle Adjani to Beatrice Dalle and Guy Marchand.\n\nCottin just seems to inhabit the part completely: deal-maker, firer of assistants, sexual predator, trickster. \u201cIt\u2019s awkward,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not like her, but I loved being in her shoes. I learned a lot concerning seduction. She never puts herself as the object of desire, she is always the one who desires. I think it moved me a little bit in terms of relationships. I mean, I\u2019m married, so I\u2019m not out flirting every day. Also, she\u2019s much smarter and stronger and more courageous than I am. But it\u2019s a pleasure to act characters more intelligent than oneself.\u201d\n\nThe day we meet, she has just landed a major Hollywood part \u2013 amazing director, incredible co-star. She is so delighted, it intrudes into her every thought. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be naked in a movie,\u201d she says at one point. \u201cI mean, if I can avoid it. Although that was before I knew who my partner was.\u201d\n\nWe talk about French feminism, or rather French depictions of femininity in culture. I couldn\u2019t imagine Fleabag, with all her disarray and independence, translating into a culture that never embraced the ladette, that never really brooked the hard-drinking, promiscuous, chain-smoking chaos-monkey as part of any feminine ideal. Which leads us to the #MeToo movement \u2013 or, as they call it in France, #moncochon (my pig).\n\n\u201cI was, of course, really happy that the silence was broken. But what is interesting in France is that no one was ever named. Is it a Vichy thing? We\u2019re so traumatised by the Nazis, so ashamed of having been collaborators, that we can\u2019t name anyone.\u201d Which, I have to say, is not the perspective I was expecting.\n\nWhile Cottin agrees that TV and film have changed, and that acting careers last longer now that scripts are more interesting, she thinks the main evolution is from within. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, you\u2019re always projecting yourself into the eyes of others. It is not important how you look \u2013 it\u2019s more important to keep filling yourself with what surrounds you. If you\u2019re not curious about how people are living, if you\u2019re not moved by what they\u2019re living for, you\u2019re dry. And you don\u2019t want to be dry.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Call My Agent is on Netflix.", "description": "Camille Cottin, France\u2019s Fleabag and the standout star of showbiz comedy Call My Agent, talks about seduction, ruthless women and the power of chic destructiveness", "authors": ["Zoe Williams"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dd1c8b362ad867dba4e34a48c66ec3c3514a2af/0_363_2657_1594/master/2657.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=909b10dfbdc917f13d0184c6f498e410", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
