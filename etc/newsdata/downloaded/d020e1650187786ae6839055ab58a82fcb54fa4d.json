Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019s emerged as frontrunner in the Democratic presidential primary, pledged during an interview with CBS News on Tuesday to forego big money fundraisers if she nabs the nomination next year \u2014 a reversal from her previous stance.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nWarren currently eschews traditional, big donor events, but had previously said that promise applied only to the primary race during an interview on MSNBC.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to be blunt,\u201d she said in February. \u201cI do not believe in unilateral disarmament.\u201d\n\nBut Warren, a top fundraiser in the third quarter, pivoted this week when asked whether she\u2019d consider holding big fundraising events should she win the Democratic primary \u2014 no matter how much money President Trump generates.\n\n\u201cI will not be forced to make changes in how I raise money,\u201d she said. \u201cLook, for me this is pretty straightforward. Either you think democracy works and electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible. Or you think it\u2019s about a grass-roots, let\u2019s build this from the ground up.\u201d\n\nIn the last three months, Warren\u2019s campaign said it raised $24.6 million from small donors. So far, her haul is higher than that of every Democratic candidate who\u2019s reported so far except for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who also rejects big donors. If he received the nomination, the self-described Democratic socialist has said he would also refuse big donor events.\n\nBy comparison, former Vice President Joe Biden, the longtime frontrunner, pulled in about $15.2 million in the third quarter, roughly $7 million short than what he\u2019d received in the previous quarter.\n\nOf course, in that same period, Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee pulled in a staggering $125 million in donations.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "The Massachusetts Democrat was a top fundraiser in the third quarter.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/74d073fe-elizabeth-warren-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
