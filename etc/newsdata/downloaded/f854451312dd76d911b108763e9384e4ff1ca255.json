Mr Dorsey said the policy text would be released by November 15.", "description": "Twitter is banning all political advertising ahead of the UK's general election in December.", "authors": ["Olivia Rudgard", "Us Technology Reporter", "Tom Hoggins"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2018/10/02/TELEMMGLPICT000175345422-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
