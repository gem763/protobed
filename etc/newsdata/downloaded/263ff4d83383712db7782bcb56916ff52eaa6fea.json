We\u2019re not going to allow them to stay on our streets, to show up in our communities, to be used against us in our synagogues, our churches, our mosques, our Walmarts, our public places.\u201d\n\nIn the Thursday night debate, O\u2019Rourke spoke about a mother whose 15-year-old daughter was shot and killed by an AR-15 in a mass shooting earlier this month in Odessa, Texas. \u201cAnd that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15,\u201d he said, raising his voice.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he shouted over cheers from the audience. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nAhead of Thursday\u2019s debate, candidates were instructed by both host network ABC News and Democratic Party officials to watch their language. The warning came after O\u2019Rourke dropped an F-bomb on the campaign trail following the massacre in El Paso.\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke stood by his call for a mandatory government buyback program for AK-47 and AR-15 rifles during Thursday night\u2019s presidential primary debate.", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/u64EazFkwJgoJ.MlK6omXQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/4aace830-d5c5-11e9-a677-01145762c20c", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
