He kind of reminded me of my younger self the way he runs.\n\n\u201cOur starts are not that great but our acceleration when we come off the bend and the run home.\n\n\u201cWe run kind of alike.\u201d", "description": "American Noah Lyles shot to 200 meters world championships gold on Tuesday, providing a bright finish to a day darkened by yet another doping scandal.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1436003652&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF903E3-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
