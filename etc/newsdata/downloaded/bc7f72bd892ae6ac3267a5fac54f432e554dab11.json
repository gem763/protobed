Eleven young children were moved out of the house, and are uninjured.\n\nThe only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel, and he had dragged three of his young children with him. They were led to certain death.\n\nHe reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down.\n\nHe ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children.\n\nHis body was mutilated by the blast.\n\nThe tunnel had caved in on him, in addition.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe thug who tried to hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him.\n\n\u2026\n\nBaghdadi and the losers who worked for him \u2014 and losers they are \u2014 they had no idea what they were getting into \u2026\n\nHe was a sick and depraved man, and now he\u2019s gone. Baghdadi was vicious, and violent, and he died in a vicious and violent way, as a coward, running and crying.\n\n\u2026\n\nA brutal killer, one who has caused so much hardship and death, has violently been eliminated. He will never again harm another innocent man, woman, or child.\n\nHe died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place.", "description": "President Trump announced that al-Baghdadi spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces.\"", "authors": ["Joel B.
