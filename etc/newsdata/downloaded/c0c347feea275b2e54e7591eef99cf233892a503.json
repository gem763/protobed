The robots are basically two connected small arms that are hinged in the middle with a clamping device at each end that they use to grip onto the voxel structures\n\nEvery time the robot takes a step onto the next voxel, it readjusts its sense of position to fit the structure it is currently standing on.\n\nThe underlying vision is that just as the most complex of images can be reproduced by using an array of pixels on a screen, virtually any physical object can be recreated as an array of smaller three-dimensional pieces, which can themselves be made up of simple struts and nodes.\n\nAs it works on assembling the pieces, each of the tiny robots can count its steps over the structure, explained .\n\n'It's missing most of the usual control systems, but as long as it doesn't miss a step, it knows where it is,' Gershenfeld said.\n\n'Ultimately, such systems could be used to construct entire buildings, especially in difficult environments such as in space, or on the moon or Mars.'\n\nThe main idea is to eliminate the need to ship large preassembled structures from Earth, as these robots could build what is needed on the space craft or planet using batches of tiny subunits.", "description": "Tiny V-shaped robots that move like inchworms could  be used to design space settlements on Mars, airplanes and homes on Earth.
