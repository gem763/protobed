And early indications are that it\u2019s working.\n\nBOLTON, NEOCONS HIT TRUMP FOR NOT STRIKING IRAN\n\nPhilippe Reines, the former State Department official and longtime Hillary Clinton confidant, said on \u201cMedia Buzz\u201d that after the first round of political combat over Ukraine, Trump is the winner.\n\nWhether that\u2019s true or not, calling out Biden is very much the focus of the president\u2019s counterattack against allegations that have reignited Democratic talk of impeachment.\n\nRudy Giuliani told me on Sunday that the political crisis is helping him accomplish what he\u2019s been trying to do for five months, which is focus media scrutiny on the former vice president and Hunter Biden, who was paid big bucks by a Ukrainian gas giant that had come under investigation. Joe Biden has publicly bragged about pressuring Ukraine into firing its top prosecutor, who was overseeing the case\u2014though it was not active at the time--by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees.\n\nGiuliani pushed the Biden story on my show last April, and many other programs as well. He has also met with Ukrainian officials in an attempt to revive the Biden probe there. (No investigation has found wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.)\n\nThe president\u2019s personal lawyer laid it out yesterday with Maria Bartiromo: \u201cIt\u2019s the only way you can get this out. The only way they would cover this story is by punching the president in the face and then the president deflects the punch which he\u2019s done, the story came down and then he hits with a right hand that\u2019s more powerful.\u201d\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nAnd that, in turn, is producing stories like this one the other day in the Washington Post:\n\n\u201cSuddenly, Biden faced two dueling realities: The president he is hoping to defeat next year \u2014 and who he describes as morally unfit for office \u2014 is under scrutiny for behavior some view as treasonous. But the story is inextricably linked to Biden\u2019s son, pushing one of the topics that Biden is least comfortable discussing into the spotlight.\u201d\n\nThe fact is it\u2019s impossible to cover the furor over the Trump call without delving into the details of what at the least is Biden\u2019s son trading on his name (as political relatives have done in every administration).\n\nTrump bristled at Ukraine questions yesterday at the U.N., telling reporters they are \"a fake news group of people...If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they'd be getting the eletric chair right now.\" At a time when longshot GOP rival Bill Weld is accusing him of treason, the president did not explain why Biden's actions would result in a death penalty case.\n\nThose comments followed Trump telling reporters on Sunday that what the Wall Street Journal and others had reported about the July call was essentially true, though he insists it was totally appropriate:\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine. And Ukraine, Ukraine\u2019s got a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nSo Trump is being accused of the same thing he\u2019s saying Biden did in 2015, pressuring Ukraine for partisan reasons. The administration has been holding up $250 in military aid to help Ukraine fight Russian separatists. Trump says he never brought up the aid, but he didn\u2019t have to\u2014it\u2019s hanging in the air.\n\nThe president said he\u2019d \u201clove\u201d to release a transcript of the call with Volodymyr Zelensky, but has to figure out how to do so.\n\nBy the way, Trump was wrong when he recently tweeted that the media \u201cwant to stay as far away as possible\u201d from the Biden allegations.\n\nA quick search found many major stories on the matter, including:\n\nNew York Times, 2015: \u201cJoe Biden, His Son and the Case Against a Ukrainian Oligarch\u201d\n\nWashington Post, 2019: \u201cAs Vice President, Biden Said Ukraine Should Increase Gas Production. Then His Son Got a Job with a Ukrainian Gas Company.\u201d\n\nNew Yorker, 2019: \u201cWill Hunter Biden Jeopardize His Father\u2019s Campaign?\u201d\n\nJoe Biden, for his part, angrily accused Trump over the weekend of abusing his power in an attempt to \u201csmear\u201d him because he knows \u201cI\u2019ll beat him like a drum.\u201d Biden said he never discussed overseas business dealings with his son, which prompted Trump to call him a liar. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker they briefly discussed it once.\n\nThe more the story devolves into a partisan back-and-forth, the more it neutralizes the political danger to the president. That was the playbook against Bob Mueller.\n\nNancy Pelosi is under growing pressure from some previously impeachment-wary Democrats to drop her opposition in light of Ukraine. She is holding the line for now while warning the White House that failure to turn over key documents could prove the tipping point.\n\nBut Trump can easily survive\u2014again\u2014if he turns this into another two-sided scandal, filled with interminable details and unpronounceable names, that most Americans can\u2019t follow.", "description": "In Donald Trump\u2019s view, the best way to neutralize a scandal is with a good counter-scandal.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/23/694940094001_6088838461001_6088822328001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
