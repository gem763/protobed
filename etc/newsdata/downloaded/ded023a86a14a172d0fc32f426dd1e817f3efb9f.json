It\u2019s described as \u201can anti-hate satire\u201d based on the book Caging Skies by Christine Leunens and also stars Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell. Waititi\u2019s previous films include What We Do in the Shadows and Thor: Ragnarok.\n\nAfter a crowd-pleasing premiere, the film picked up mostly positive reviews with Time Out\u2019s Joshua Rothkopf claiming that Waititi is \u201clegitimately breaking new ground\u201d although there were many detractors. Los Angeles Times\u2019s Justin Chang criticised it as being \u201cterminally self-satisfied\u201d while The AV Club\u2019s AA Dowd called it \u201cthe most twee Holocaust movie ever\u201d. The film was also awarded two stars in a Guardian review.\n\nWaititi has spoken about his struggles to get an actor to play the role of Hitler which he eventually took on himself. \u201cMost people really loved the script,\u201d he said to the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cI think it was a little difficult for people to figure out if it was a good career move, and I can fucking totally understand. Who really wants to see themselves as Adolf Hitler on a poster?\u201d\n\nSecond place went to Noah Baumbach\u2019s semi-autobiographical divorce comedy drama Marriage Story, also starring Johansson as an actor divorcing her theatre director husband, played by Adam Driver. The film has received universal acclaim since its original premiere in Venice. Third place was given to Bong Joon-ho\u2019s class satire Parasite, which many are predicting could be a rare foreign language best picture nominee.\n\nThe last seven winners of the people\u2019s choice award have all either won or been nominated for the best picture Oscar. Previous winners include Slumdog Millionaire, Precious, 12 Years a Slave, The King\u2019s Speech, Room and Green Book last year.", "description": "Taika Waititi\u2019s whimsical second world war film has won the people\u2019s choice award at this year\u2019s Toronto film festival, following in the footsteps of Green Book", "authors": ["Benjamin Lee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/277facd8579efd2a18a8b1ff83fae1b700777bab/274_395_5726_3435/master/5726.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c277bd55e3d365cfead77965d07f4585", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
