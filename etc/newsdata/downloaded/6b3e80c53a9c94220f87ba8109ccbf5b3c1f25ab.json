The new year is only fifteen weeks away, which isn\u2019t too soon to start thinking about restructuring stock portfolios.\n\nThe economy is still in reasonably good shape, which bodes well for stocks. It would be naive to believe the coming year, however, is going to look like a year that\u2019s about to wind down. As market conditions change and the economic growth cycle matures, different areas thrive, while others struggle.\n\nGeography can matter too.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here\u2019s a rundown of ten stocks to watch as 2019 comes to a close and 2020 gears up. Now may not be the ideal time to step into them, but now\u2019s when they should be added to watchlists for due diligence purposes. Notice that not all of them are high-profile names, but they\u2019re each positioned nicely for growth \u2026 more so than most of their peers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)\n\nStocks to Watch for 2020 Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) More\n\nSource: achinthamb / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s not a name that needs much in the way of an introduction. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is, of course, the parent to search engine giant Google, though the company is so much more than a search engine. Email, cloud-based platforms galore and the world\u2019s most popular mobile device operating system all funnel people into the Google ecosystem.\n\nYes, that sheer size has become something of a liability. The world is distrustful of one company knowing so much about each and every person who connects to the web to use a Google-provided service. Even without a clear end-goal, state and federal regulators seem to be on a mission to declaw the company\u2019s reach.\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t matter. Even a better-contained Google will still serve billions of regular users, each of which ultimately represents revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA)\n\nStocks to Watch for 2020 Ulta Beauty (ULTA) More\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s a misnomer to say Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has put every single small brick-and-mortar retailer on its heels. Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), which sells skincare and hair care products as well as perfume and cosmetics via more than a thousand stores in the U.S. is doing just fine.\n\nGranted, that wasn\u2019t the case a week ago, when the stock was standing in the shadow of its own 30%+ selloff that materialized in a matter of days. Quarterly revenue as well as earnings fell short of expectations, and that news was made worse to contracted full-year guidance.\n\nAs Luke Lango noted at the time though, \u201cany and all slowdowns in the U.S. personal care industry over the past two decades have been small and short-lived. During that stretch, personal care sales have risen at a fairly steady 4% compounded annual growth rate, and there have never been back-to-back years of declines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWalmart (WMT)\n\nStocks to Watch for 2020 Walmart (WMT) More\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s another name that doesn\u2019t need any description \u2014 add Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to your list of stocks to watch for the coming year.\n\nThere was a time not too long ago when the world\u2019s biggest retailer didn\u2019t necessarily deserve such acknowledgement. Its web presence was a joke (given its size), inventory management was poor and the organization almost demonstrated a kind of contempt for its customers.", "description": "It sounds and seems impossible, but we're within sight of the end of 2019, and the beginning of 2020.
