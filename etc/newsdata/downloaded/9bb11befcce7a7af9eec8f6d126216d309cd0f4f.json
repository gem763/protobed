The president also called Fed officials \"boneheads\" in the tweet. \"The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt. INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN, while at the same time substantially lengthening the term,\" he said. A Fed spokesman declined comment on the latest Trump salvos. The president also made a new suggestion not seen in some of his past attacks on the Fed, saying that the country should refinance its debt load. The U.S. has $22.5 trillion in debt, $16.7 trillion of which is owed by the public.\n\nThat debt load has grown $2.6 trillion, or 13% under Trump, due in part to the 2017 tax cut that Trump shepherded through Congress. Taxpayers have shelled out $538.6 billion in interest costs in the 2019 fiscal year, easily a record. The idea for \"refinancing\" federal debt is without any modern precedent. \"It's not viable and could be a significant problem for investors, financial markets and ultimately the economy,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The debt is not prepayable. There's a contractual relationship the Treasury has with investors. This isn't a mortgage, this is U.S. Treasury debt. I think it would be incredibly disruptive to financial markets, and interest rates would ultimately rise, not fall.\" On Trump's push for zero or negative rates, Zandi said he doesn't see much benefit. \"The question you have to ask yourself is, if we go down to zero and we actually experienced a recession, then what?\" he said.\n\n'It's a bold idea'\n\nIt's unclear how the refinancing idea would work. The Treasury Department likely would have to be involved, and there have been calls recently to issue longer-term debt, such as a 50- or 100-year Treasury. \"From a theoretical standpoint, obviously it would be wonderful for the United States government over a period of years if it were to lengthen the maturities on debt that would have rates below 1%,\" said banking analyst Dick Bove at Odeon Capital Group. \"It would certainly be beneficial to the United States government. Whether it would be beneficial to the United States economy is an open question.\" Cutting rates to zero or below would cheapen debt costs but also make the U.S. a less desirable spot for capital flow as the ability to generate yield would become more difficult. The Fed is expected to approve another quarter-point rate cut at its meeting next week, following July's reduction that was the first such move in 11 years. Markets foresee one more reduction before the end of the year and another in early 2020. While central bank officials have said they would expect rates to go close to zero in the event of another recession, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday he does not see a downturn on the horizon. \"If we ever went to negative interest rates, the money would stop coming into the United States and it would start flowing to wherever investors could find reasonable return that was positive,\" Bove said. \"That would slow the growth of the private sector. It's definitely uncharted territory. It's a bold idea. On balance, I think it would be harmful.\"", "description": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday continued his verbal assault on the Federal Reserve, who he blames for slowing the economy.", "authors": ["Jeff Cox John Melloy", "Jeff Cox", "John Melloy"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106120244-1568065415906rts2pwaw.jpg?v=1568065481", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
