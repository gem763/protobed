They really do.\u201d\n\nCharlotte Charles and her husband Bruce Charles arrived in Washington DC on Tuesday to meet Trump More\n\nHer husband, Bruce Charles, added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why haven\u2019t they come back with any information for us? Are they trying to figure out how to relay the information? Or are they covering up?\"\n\nHarry Dunn, 19, died when an American woman, Anne Sacoolas, crashed her car into his motorbike while she was driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nAfter Mr Dunn\u2019s death the US authorities spirited her away from the UK, forcing the Dunn family to travel to the US and beg Mr Trump to return her to Britain.\n\nMrs Sacoolas\u2019s husband Jonathan was initially described as a diplomat, but is now believed to be a spy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re led to believe he\u2019s a spy, from the media reports,\u201d said Mrs Charles. \u201cThat\u2019s all we know. Dominic Raab mentioned it.\u201d\n\nMr Charles added: \u201cHe said he was senior.\u201d\n\nAn early photograph of Anne Sacoolas' husband Jonathan, first thought to be a diplomat but now believed to be a spy More\n\nHis wife continued: \u201cI can\u2019t remember exactly how he explained it, but he said he was brought in to control that area. Or sector. He just used a lot of different words to skirt the issue.\u201d\n\nAsked whether they had asked the Foreign Office for clarification as to his status, Mr Dunn laughed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re their favourite people,\u201d he said.\n\nMr and Mrs Charles, plus Mr Dunn and his wife Tracey, found themselves in the \u201csurreal\u201d surroundings of the Oval Office, with only their spokesman Radd Seiger \u2013 a friend from their village in Northamptonshire - for help.\n\nAsked whether they were surprised to have no British diplomat accompanying them, Mr Dunn replied: \u201cMaybe it might have helped. But they haven\u2019t really spoken to us so we don\u2019t know how they feel about the whole situation.\u201d", "description": "The parents of Harry Dunn have accused the British government of abandoning them during their visit to the United States, saying they believe the Foreign Office \u201cjust want us to go away and forget about it all\u201d.
