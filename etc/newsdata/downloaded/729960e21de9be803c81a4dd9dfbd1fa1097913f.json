Occasionally, we do get aggression in the street and it\u2019s quite scary for them.\n\n\u2018He should be able to take his son to Parliament if he wants to and it should be okay for him to come out without being shouted at.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018The thing about politicians is no one really feels any sympathy for them and to a certain extent you have to suck it up. This is just what happens if you are in politics in Britain today. The police were amazing.
