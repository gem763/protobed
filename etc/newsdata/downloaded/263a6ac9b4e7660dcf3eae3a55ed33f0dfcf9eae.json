Ditch Brazilian Leather Over Amazon Rainforest Fires", "language": "en", "text": "As Brazil\u2019s cattle industry comes under increased scrutiny for its contribution to the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest, two of the world\u2019s largest fashion companies \u2014 Sweden\u2019s H&M Group and VF Corp., the American company behind brands like Vans and Timberland \u2014 have said they\u2019re ditching Brazilian leather.\n\nH&M, the world\u2019s second-largest fashion retailer, said Friday that it would stop sourcing leather from Brazil \u201cuntil there are credible assurance systems in place to verify that the leather does not contribute to environmental harm in the Amazon.\u201d\n\n\u201cDue to the severe fires in the Brazilian part of the Amazon rainforest, and the connections to cattle production, we have decided to place a temporary ban on leather from Brazil,\u201d a spokesperson for the H&M Group told ABC News.\n\nH&M\u2019s ban came on the heels of a similar announcement made the week before by VF Corp., which owns several apparel and footwear brands including Dickies, Eastpak, JanSport and The North Face.\n\nVF Corp. said in a statement that it would stop buying Brazilian leather \u201cuntil we have the confidence and assurance that the materials used in our products do not contribute to environmental harm in the country.\u201d\n\nIn one of the first major corporate responses to the blazes, VF Corp. said it will stop using leather from Brazil until it has \"the confidence and assurance that the materials used in our products do not contribute to environmental harm in the country\" https://t.co/zgIIw2XLad \u2014 CNN Business (@CNNBusiness) August 30, 2019\n\nThe Brazilian beef and leather industry has been pinpointed as a major cause of deforestation in the Amazon and, in turn, the devastating wildfires that have been burning there for weeks. Swaths of the Amazon \u2015 the world\u2019s biggest terrestrial carbon sink and most biodiverse ecosystem \u2015 are cut down and burned by cattle ranchers every year to make way for pasture. In Brazil, cattle ranches now cover approximately 174,000 square miles of deforested Amazon \u2015 an area about two-thirds the size of Texas.\n\nBrazil exported $1.4 billion of bovine leather in 2018, Reuters reported, citing data from the country\u2019s main leather trade group. Its largest export markets were the U.S., China and Italy.\n\nIt remains unclear how much of an impact the Brazilian leather ban will have on H&M and VF Corp. Both companies have said they source only a small portion of their leather from Brazil.\n\nStill, environmentalists and others have lauded the two companies for taking a stand against the Amazon\u2019s deforestation \u2015 and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s apparently indifferent response to it.", "description": "The Swedish fashion retailer and the company behind brands like Vans and Timberland said they're banning leather from Brazil over environmental concerns.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d74fea5240000822677c70a.jpeg?cache=8n30tdx24k&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
