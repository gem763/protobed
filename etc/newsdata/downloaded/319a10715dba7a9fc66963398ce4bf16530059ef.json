Kircher, who was House counsel for the Republican majority between 2011 and 2016. \u201cHe is poking his fingers into all of the places where we have norms and traditions and things that both parties have respected for years, and he has blown all of those out the window.\u201d\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who has overseen the recent flurry of oversight activity in the House, said the spike in witness cooperation and the willingness of whistleblowers to come forward has been a welcome change in an otherwise frustrating exercise. But Schiff doesn\u2019t expect it to last long, predicting the White House will continue what he called its \u201csiege\u201d on documents and witnesses in the coming days.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s one reason Democrats have decided they can no longer wait on the courts to come to their rescue. If Trump continues to stonewall their investigations \u2014 particularly on Ukraine \u2014 they will compile a list of his defiant actions and package it into an article of impeachment on obstructing Congress, according to senior Democrats familiar with their strategy.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe real risk of the Trump administration\u2019s blanket stonewalling of Congress is that it\u2019s fundamentally altered the balance of power that our framers intended,\u201d Schiff said in an interview Saturday. \u201cIf a president can thwart congressional oversight that means any future president can be as corrupt as they choose and there\u2019s no recourse.\u201d\n\nSome liberal Democrats want their party to do more to force compliance with oversight requests, concerned the response to the Trump administration\u2019s truculence has been too timid. Lawmakers, including Schiff, have discussed the possibility of trying to fine, censure or withhold money from obstinate Trump officials \u2014 but even those possibilities, they warn, may do nothing.\n\nAD\n\nFor the 277 days that Trump has faced an adversarial House Democratic majority, his administration has worked systematically to resist congressional investigations and further diminish Capitol Hill\u2019s power to keep the executive branch in check.\n\nAD\n\nAdministration officials have ignored subpoenas, blocked witnesses from testifying and even defied the legislative power of the purse stipulated in the Constitution.\n\nThis past week Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to comply with a deadline for handing over documents related to the impeachment inquiry over Ukraine, saying Saturday that while his department would \u201cdo all the things we\u2019re required to do by law\u201d he considered much of the Democrats\u2019 efforts with regard to his department as \u201charassment.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nUnder the Trump presidency, Capitol Hill has become accustomed to executive resistance.\n\nFaced with a Congress unwilling to offer funding for a border wall, Trump instead declared a national emergency to get around the legislative branch and dedicate money to the project by taking funds away from military construction accounts. He has also relied heavily on acting Cabinet officials, denying the Senate its role to vet and vote to confirm administration candidates under the \u201cadvise and consent\u201d requirement laid out in the Constitution. The top ranks of the Homeland Security Department, which oversees Trump\u2019s top policy priority of immigration, are made up almost entirely of acting officials who have not been scrutinized by the Senate.\n\nAD\n\nAnd throughout his term, Trump has been aided by Republican lawmakers who have shown little appetite to help curb the president\u2019s executive authority \u2014 hastening the decline of congressional power that had already been chipped away for decades.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that it makes it easier for future administrations to just ignore the will of Congress,\u201d Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) said of the Trump administration\u2019s approach to Capitol Hill. \u201cI frankly am worried that it means there\u2019ll be less and less bipartisanship in defending Congress.\u201d\n\nThe Trump White House is far from the first to clash with Congress\u2019s intent on exercising oversight, although experts say this administration\u2019s efforts to battle Capitol Hill are unprecedented.\n\nThe George W. Bush administration tried to shield some of its top officials \u2014 including White House counsel Harriet Miers and chief of staff Josh Bolten \u2014 from testifying before and providing information to Congress on the firing of U.S. attorneys by asserting privilege, an argument later rejected by the courts. House Republicans battled with the Obama administration over a controversial gunrunning operation at the Justice Department \u2014 launching a legal battle over records that was settled only earlier this year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut experts say Trump\u2019s defiance stands apart because of his unwillingness to engage in any oversight. Ever since he vowed last spring to ignore \u201call the subpoenas,\u201d his subordinates have refused to allow even a single Trump official to cooperate, creating what some experts call a constitutional crisis that Democrats have struggled to respond to and counter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just gotten steadily worse with each president being more and more resistant to congressional oversight,\u201d said former Republican congressman Tom Davis of Virginia, who chaired the House Oversight Committee from 2003 to 2007. \u201cThe tendency over the last 40 years has been, the president\u2019s party tends to under-investigate and the opposition party tends to over-investigate.\u201d\n\nDavis added: \u201cIt didn\u2019t start with Trump; he\u2019s certainly taken it to the next level.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis year alone, the Trump administration has worked to methodically delay and block about two dozen probes into his conduct as president, his personal finances and the policies of his administration. He has stonewalled on everything from security clearances given to his family to his tax returns. He has ignored compulsory measures on his controversial family separation policy at the border and refused to let his staff testify about what they told former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of his investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump has argued that he is being unfairly treated by a Democratic House that is singularly focused on impeaching him and diminishing the successes of his administration, particularly on the economy. On Friday, he declined to say whether he would cooperate with House investigators, deferring to White House attorneys who Trump said believed the probe was \u201cso unfair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey've never seen anything so unjust,\u201d Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. \u201cI've been president now for almost three years, and I\u2019ve been going through this for almost three years. It's almost become, like, a part of my day.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s active resistance, House Democrats have had some recent luck in their probe of the Ukraine controversy. On Thursday, a former special U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, turned over a trove of potentially damning text messages that Democrats say clearly show a president willing to leverage foreign aid for political purposes. He also testified voluntarily for 10 hours, the first friendly witness for the Democrats all year.\n\nTheir good fortune may continue this week. Marie \u201cMasha\u201d Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from her post in May by Pompeo, has agreed to testify on Friday. Trump called her \u201cbad news\u201d in the now-infamous July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe committees are also expecting to hear from the whistleblower who initially set off the Ukrainian firestorm by detailing Trump\u2019s request that Zelensky probe former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential candidate, and his son Hunter.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, will give a deposition Tuesday to the three House committees leading the investigations into Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine. The House panels probably will have to battle the State Department to access Sondland\u2019s text messages and other documents.\n\nWhile Democrats are looking at a possible quick impeachment of Trump this winter, many said they haven\u2019t given up on long-term solutions to try to restore Congress\u2019s authority. They plan to see half a dozen court cases trying to uphold their subpoenas through, hoping federal judges will at some point validate their oversight.\n\nSchiff also said lawmakers are drafting their own set of \u201cpost-Watergate reforms\u201d such as those Congress enacted after President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s resignation. One of those will be a bill that would expedite court review of congressional process fights with the White House.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to validate and vindicate our oversight responsibilities,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Constitutional experts and lawmakers worry that President Trump\u2019s hostile stance toward congressional oversight and Democrats flailing attempts to respond are undermining the separation of powers in a way that could have long-term implications for the democracy.", "authors": ["Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter", "Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ssc-20zq-DQRPrC05EMV3P3VIy8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DTS7ZURJX4I6TEDOTVK3MRI6WQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
