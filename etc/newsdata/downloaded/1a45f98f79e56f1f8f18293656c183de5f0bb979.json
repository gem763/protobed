That is exactly what I said before, and I really meant it.\n\nBut assigning blame before finding out the facts is \u201ccounterproductive,\u201d the president said, explicitly referring to Riyadh and Washington pointing finger at Tehran.\n\nAnd while Russia is ready to assist the Saudi fact-finding effort, such contribution \u2013 as well as friendly relations with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 will never come at the expense of the long-standing ties with neighboring Iran, \u201ca big country\u201d that \u201chas existed on its territory for thousands of years [and] has its own interests.\u201d\n\nRussia will never be friends with one country against another. We build bilateral relations that rely on positive trends generated by our contacts; we do not build alliances against anyone.\n\nLikewise, Moscow will not take on the \"unrewarding\" role of a mediator in the Riyadh-Tehran feud, Putin said, adding that the he believes the two nations are capable of solving their disputes without a middleman.\n\nAlso on rt.com Is Saudi Aramco lying about its damaged oil infrastructure?\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
