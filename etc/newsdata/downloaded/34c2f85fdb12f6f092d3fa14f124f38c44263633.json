The hanging dollar bills have become a well-known aesthetic at the bar-restaurant, in which tourists and locals will leave bills scrawled with dates, names and sweet notes.\n\nSiesta Key Oyster Bar/Kristin Hale\n\nSiesta Key Oyster Bar/Kristin Hale\n\n\"It's meant for memorabilia,\" Hale explained. \"We found one -- somebody expecting, and wrote 'baby coming soon' on the bill -- and we started it, and it just took off.\"\n\nFor one month, 40 SKOB employees carefully removed the money off the walls where it was secured with a heavy duty staple gun. Once word got out of SKOB's efforts, customers began giving $5 and $20 bills, Hale said.\n\nSiesta Key Oyster Bar/Megan Atkins\n\nRamon Espinosa/AP, FILE\n\nThis week, Hale brought the large container of cash to a local bank, which counted out $13,961.\n\nIn the past, sisters and owners Jill Pedigo, Beth Owen-Cipielewski and their husbands would take money off the walls and donate some of it to local charities. Hale said they once gave it to a safe house for battered women.\n\nSiesta Key Oyster Bar/Erin Morgan\n\nSiesta Key Oyster Bar/Kristin Hale\n\nThis time, the money will be given to the American Red Cross for those affected by Hurricane Dorian -- a Category 5 storm that killed at least 50 people and left about 76,000 homeless.\n\nSiesta Key Oyster Bar/Samantha Lemmer\n\nSiesta Key Oyster Bar/Erin Morgan\n\n\"Honestly, I'm shocked, I think the staff is shocked,\" said Hale, adding that quite a few bills still dangled from SKOB's ceiling and walls. \"I don't think we ever expected it to amount [to] that much. Knowing it was such a lump sum of that magnitude is overwhelming.\"", "description": "Siesta Key Oyster Bar in Sarasota, Florida, has made it a novelty tradition for patrons to write messages on dollar bills and secure them to its ceiling and walls.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/bar-pulls-14000-walls-hurricane-dorian-ht-MAIN-np-191002_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
