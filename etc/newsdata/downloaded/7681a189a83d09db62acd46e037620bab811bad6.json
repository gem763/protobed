So god bless and, seriously, just go to hell with Joker.\n\nThis is one of those special, ghastly, insightful cases where criticism becomes warfare, fandom is assault, and discourse is a meaningless cacophony. It\u2019s meaningless in that, as you ping-pong from extreme opinion and flash hot take to concerned safety warning and vehement defense, you\u2019re no closer to gleaning an answer to what should be a very fair and simple question: Should you see the damn film?\n\nJoker has earned polarizing reviews, extreme on both ends, but much praise for Joaquin Phoenix in the title role. In the same news cycle in which the film stunned the industry by winning the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, critics warned that its content might actually be dangerous, arguing that it glorifies the ethos of angry loners, disaffected white men, and \u201cincels\u201d (so-called involuntary celibates) proliferating in the country\u2019s mass shooting epidemic.\n\nVanity Fair wrote that the film may be \u201cirresponsible propaganda for the very men it pathologizes.\u201d Police forces around the country have publicly stated that they\u2019ve beefed up security at opening weekend screenings. Critics against the idea that violent cinema begets violent action retaliated against this \u201coverreaction.\u201d Fans eager to see the film decried yet another blizzard of \u201csnowflakes\u201d trying to sanitize culture.\n\nOne side screams. The other screams back louder. The volume of the cacophony is thrilling, insinuating that something important is going on. But in the end, it\u2019s an unpleasant distraction. No actual point is made.\n\nGo see Joker, or don\u2019t. (Though, call me crazy, when it comes to questions like \u201cwill I get shot at the movies this weekend?\u201d I tend not to test whether people are overreacting.)\n\nYou may find it provocative, or you may find it insufferable. You may find it intellectually ludicrous and philosophically empty, but still be impressed by Phoenix. Both things can be true. (And kind of are.) That the film has become this line in the sand when it comes to \u201cwhere we stand as a culture\u201d is the real danger. Maybe we need a self-examination. This film, of all films, ain\u2019t the one to trigger it.\n\nThe single most annoying thing about all this has been the comments made by writer-director Todd Phillips, whom you probably know best from the Hangover franchise and Old School, in response to criticism.\n\nFirst, he blamed the concerns raised over the film\u2019s content and message on the \u201cfar left,\u201d because \u201coutrage is a commodity.\u201d It\u2019s a Trump-ian deflection in lieu of an actual defense, explanation, or justification of his creative choices. But that\u2019s not as infuriating as when he said he was driven to make the film after he left comedy because of \u201cwoke culture.\u201d Read his full Vanity Fair quote here:\n\n\u201cWoke culture,\u201d however you might define it, isn\u2019t cancelling or stopping comedy, or banning irreverence or edginess. As my eyes go cross-eyed seeing the number of zeroes attached to the comedy deals being made with multiple streaming and cable services, I\u2019d say the industry is booming. So is the interrogation of that industry.\n\nThat interrogation, sure, is amplified and perhaps not always as nuanced as it needs to be thanks to social media. But as any industry grows, so does the consideration of the value of its output, and what responsibility accompanies its surge.\n\nIf a person truly loved comedy, as Phillips purports to, then this should be something they welcome: true refining and consideration of their art form meant to better it, not get rid of it. That this refining and consideration is happening in real time, thanks to the blogosphere and social media, is fascinating. That these arenas give voice to previously marginalized groups whose voices, opinions, and criticisms had been silenced\u2014and this is the reaction we\u2019re seeing to their voices finally having a platform\u2014is telling.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019d say the straight white man who made the Hangover trilogy should have no hardship getting another comedy made in Hollywood. For all the hand-wringing over the responsibility of a film like Joker, there is no doubt that it will draw blockbuster crowds this weekend, something that will give him more opportunity and more creative license. What he seems uninterested in doing, based on these comments, is making an effort to evolve.\n\nAs critic Louis Virtel said on Twitter, \u201c\u2018Comedy got hard because people are smarter now\u2019 is a fun way to tell on yourself.\u201d From my vantage point, the issue isn\u2019t cancel culture or woke culture or PC culture. It is creators who only want their work to be applauded and celebrated, not discussed and dissected. That is not culture at all.\n\nThe Joker discourse is so exhausting because everyone thinks they\u2019re doing something different, something renegade, something disruptive here. But it\u2019s the same old song over and over again, a cultural record scratch. Send in the clowns, the clowns, the clowns, the clowns....\n\nIt\u2019s Fun to Be Named Kevin\n\nIn 2012 when I was working for The Atlantic\u2019s website as an entertainment writer, my boss went out of town and I was in charge of editing and posting the regular columns (we called them blogs then). When my editor returned a week later, she was disturbed to receive an email from one of those columnists with the subject line: \u201cWe need to talk about Kevin.\u201d She was aghast. What could her baby gay protegee Kevin Fallon possibly have done?\n\nTurns out the writer was filing a story about the film starring Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller, which was soon to be released. It was not an extremely fun time to be named Kevin, given the fact that the Kevin in the film was a disturbed teenager who commits mass murder at his school. You\u2019d be surprised how many people would find ways to joke about that, somehow mocking my name and the film title.\n\nThat first Atlantic email, however, was a beautiful, innocent, hilarious mistake. We eventually memorialized it in a fake article for the website, terrified the entire time that we\u2019d accidentally activate it.\n\nI was reminded of that story this week after receiving a confusing email myself, one with the phrase \u201cKevin Can F**k Himself\u201d in the subject line. AMC has apparently greenlit a new series with that very title. Looks like my trolls finally landed a development deal. (Hey-o!)\n\nAccording to a press release, the series \u201cprobes the secret life of a type of woman we all grew up believing we knew: the sitcom wife,\u201d and \u201clooks to break television convention and ask what the world looks like through her eyes.\u201d This is JUST FANTASTIC when you\u2019re reminded of a little bit of showbiz absurdity from two years ago.\n\nThere was another \u201cKevin\u201d show, Kevin Can Wait, starring Kevin James and Erinn Hayes. At the end of the first season, Hayes\u2019 character was unceremoniously killed off the show. When I say unceremoniously, I mean the only time her death is acknowledged is when a coupon flyer addressed to her is sent to the house. James went on record to say that the decision was made because they were \u201cliterally just running out of ideas\u201d for the character. Plight of the wife.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m not insinuating that Kevin Can F**k Himself is inspired by all this. But I am saying if they cast Erinn Hayes, you\u2019ll hear me hollering from the moon.\n\nNever Change, Gwyneth Paltrow\n\nTo catch you up: In a viral video from earlier this summer, it was revealed that Gwyneth Paltrow did not know she appeared in the film Spider-Man: Homecoming. In a viral video from this week, Paltrow herself revealed that she also never saw it after it came out. There is such a purity to this level of being out-of-touch that I find it as endearing and adorable as I do incorrigible.\n\nThe Best Casting News of the Week\n\nThe finest, most affecting stage performance I\u2019ve seen on the Broadway stage was Cynthia Erivo\u2019s turn as Celie in The Color Purple revival. Sometimes reviews are subjective opinions. Sometimes they\u2019re just plain facts. Erivo\u2019s unparalleled talent, on display in that production: Fact.\n\nAnyway, she was just cast as Aretha Franklin in the new season of National Geographic\u2019s Genius series, which is another fact: Perfect casting. Look what God has done.\n\nThere Was a Handmaid\u2019s Tale-themed Wedding\n\nPresented without comment. OK, one comment: Please read the photographers\u2019 interview about the whole ordeal. \u201cEveryone loves a good witch hunt... Apparently today we are their witch.\u201d\n\nHappy weekend!\n\nWhat to watch this week:\n\nPain and Glory: Antonio Banderas and Pedro Almod\u00f3var, because we could all use a swoon and a cry.\n\nBatwoman: The Batman-adjacent character we deserve to explore this week!\n\nWhat to skip this week:\n\nJoker: Ugh.\n\nLucy in the Sky: No diaper! Rude.\n\nKids Say the Darndest Things: Confusingly unfunny.", "description": "Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture.", "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570200421/191003-Fallon-Obsessed-tease_rqtgro", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
