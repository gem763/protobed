We need to demonstrate our green credentials. \u2014 BHP Minerals America president Daniel Malchuk\n\n\"Just to give you an idea of the magnitude of this, it's equivalent to the annual emissions of approximately 700,000 cars,\" he said.\n\n\"Sustainable copper, green copper ... is an imperative for the industry. We need to continue to demonstrate our green credentials.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChile is responsible for about a third of global copper production, and BHP produces about a quarter of the country's output.\n\nBHP also used its announcement to update its progress towards its 2030 target for eliminating water drawdown from aquifers at the mines, which are located in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on earth.\n\nA new desalination water plant will come online at Spence in 2020, which will allow desalinated water to become the mine's primary source. The plan will have a capacity of 1000 litres a second, and will support the Spence mine's \"Growth Option\" expansion.\n\nDesalination upgrades at Escondida will increase capacity there, with BHP saying it had invested $US4 billion in Escondida's desalination projects so far.\n\nBHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie said last Thursday that desalination might also be an option at Olympic Dam, assuming the site reached a scale equivalent to the Chilean operations.\n\nHe also said copper was set to become one of BHP's most promising businesses, given the likely surge in demand associated with accelerating decarbonisation and the shift to copper-intensive renewable energy sources.\n\nBHP is exploring greenfield copper opportunities in Ecuador. Mr Malchuk said a greenfield project in Chile would have to use renewable energy and desalinated water from day one, but in Ecuador it was \"too early to tell\".", "description": "All power at the Escondida and Spence mines will come from renewables, and no water will come from aquifers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_212/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0c6655466c84a3d8f4b4883d8cc2a7bbc384f54a", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
