In fact, I think the contrary is true,\u201d Bolton, a hardliner towards North Korea and Iran who was fired by Trump three weeks ago, said at Washington\u2019s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.\n\nUnder current circumstances, Bolton said, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \u201cwill never give up the nuclear weapons voluntarily.\u201d\n\nIn firing Bolton, Trump said he \u201cdisagreed strongly with many of his suggestions\u201d and that the former adviser had made mistakes by demanding that Kim follow a \u201cLibyan model\u201d in which he would have to give up all his nuclear weapons unilaterally.\n\nTrump has met Kim to negotiate North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons, but talks have been stalled since the two leaders\u2019 failed second summit in Hanoi in February.\n\nBolton, a foreign policy hawk and Trump\u2019s third national security adviser, had pressed Trump not to let up pressure on North Korea despite diplomatic efforts.\n\nIn his speech, Bolton issued a litany of warnings about how Washington was handling the North Korea threat, from sanctions not being enforced effectively and U.S. complacency about Pyongyang\u2019s missile testing to suspension of \u201cwar games\u201d with South Korea.\n\n\u201cRight now we are in a classic standoff with North Korea,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cThey want a piece of something that we should not be prepared to give them.\u201d\n\nSince taking office in 2017, Trump has gone from belittling Kim on Twitter as \u201clittle rocket man\u201d to embracing a personal brand of diplomacy, and meetings with Kim, as a way to achieve what formal negotiations have not.\n\nBOLTON QUESTIONS PRIORITIES\n\nBolton outlined what he believes are the gains North Korea has made and the proliferation threat that remains - and took a swipe at his former boss\u2019 priorities.\n\n\u201cThese are questions that need to focus our attention, not \u2018can we get another summit with Kim Jong Un\u2019 or \u2018what the state of staff-level negotiations are to achieve a commitment from North Korea it will never honor,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if \u201cromance diplomacy\u201d was the best way with North Korea, Bolton replied: \u201cI am not going to comment on that.\u201d\n\nBut he warned that the freeze in North Korea\u2019s testing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, which Trump has hailed as a triumph of his diplomacy, came because Pyongyang had finished testing of such weapons.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not an encouraging sign. That\u2019s a sign to be worried about,\u201d he said, while adding that North Korea\u2019s recent testing of shorter-range missiles, which Trump has sought to play down, could help development of longer-range missiles.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton speaks during a graduation ceremony at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, U.S., May 22, 2019. REUTERS/Michelle McLoughlin\n\nBolton said there was an ongoing danger of North Korea selling nuclear expertise to other countries, and argued that for those who believed it was unacceptable for Pyongyang to have nuclear weapons \u201cat some point, military force has to be an option.\u201d\n\nBolton, a chief architect of Trump\u2019s strident stance against Iran, had argued against the president\u2019s suggestions of a possible meeting with the Iranian leadership and advocated a tougher approach on Russia and, more recently, Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cTime works against those who oppose nuclear proliferation and a relaxed attitude to time is a benefit to the likes of North Korea and Iran,\u201d Bolton said, while also arguing that any relaxation of sanctions benefited the proliferator more than any marginal reduction in a nuclear program.", "description": "North Korea has no intention of giving up its nuclear weapons and Pyongyang benefits from stalling in its standoff with Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump's ousted national security adviser John Bolton said in a speech on Monday.", "authors": ["David Brunnstrom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435537394&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0X9", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
