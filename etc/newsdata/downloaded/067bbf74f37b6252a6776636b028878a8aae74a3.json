And here we go. The government has now published the pages and pages of new laws that need to be passed to make our departure from the EU happen.\n\nForget the meaningful vote, to get Brexit done - as the prime minister never tires of saying - this whole bundle of legislation has to pass.\n\nThe European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill is a document of 110 pages that details exactly how Parliament is expected to put the deal that the prime minister agreed with his counterparts around the continent into UK law.\n\nFor Brexit watchers it is a big moment.\n\nRead more from the BBC's political editor.\n\nIf the programme motion is approved, the bill will then move to the committee stage - which will continue on into Wednesday - when MPs will have the opportunity to put down amendments.\n\nThese are expected to include attempts to keep the UK more closely aligned with the EU through a customs union and to stage a second referendum.\n\nBoth are bitterly opposed by the government, raising the possibility that it could pull the bill altogether if either gets through.\n\nAhead of the debate, Mr Johnson said: \"The public doesn't want any more delays, neither do other European leaders and neither do I.\n\n\"Let's get Brexit done on 31 October and move on.\"\n\nHowever, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, accused ministers of trying to \"bounce\" MPs into approving a bill that could cause \"huge damage\" to the country.\n\nWhat is the proposed timetable for the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?\n\nTuesday - second reading - MPs' first chance to debate the bill and vote for its continued passage. If passed at second reading, committee stage begins the same day.\n\nWednesday and Thursday - committee stage - where detailed examination of the bill takes place and specific amendments - on a fresh referendum, for example - can be tabled and voted on. The bill then moves on to report stage, which offers further opportunities for amendments before it moves to third reading. This is MPs' final chance to debate the bill before voting on whether to approve it.\n\nIf approved, it then moves to the Lords to begin a similar scrutiny process.\n\nShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Labour was \"outraged\" by the government's attempt to push the bill through in a short time.\n\n\"When I did the Health and Social Care Act, which was a major piece of legislation, it took three months,\" the Labour MP told BBC Breakfast.\n\n\"In order for politicians to do their job properly, we do need to have time,\" she added.\n\nImage caption Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said her party was \"outraged\" by the government's behaviour\n\nThe SNP's Pete Wishart also condemned a lack of economic impact assessments of the deal ahead of the attempt to pass the legislation.\n\nEx-Tory MP Rory Stewart, who lost the party whip when he voted in support of the Benn Act, said he would back Mr Johnson's bill in principle but wanted to ensure Parliament had a \"normal\" amount of time to debate it.\n\n\"We need to finish this in the proper way, and if we're going to deliver Brexit, we need to deliver it in a way that Brexiteers and Remainers believe was taken through Parliament fairly,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nBut Mr Rees-Mogg said other acts had been brought and passed with short notice.\n\n\"A king emperor left in 24 hours, and we are removing an imperial yoke in over a week,\" he added.\n\nAnd Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told BBC Breakfast that Parliament \"can move pretty quickly\" and has already had 500 hours of debate on Brexit.\n\n\"So most MPs, frankly, are very familiar with the vast majority of issues that are in this bill,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright JESSICA TAYLOR Image caption Jacob Rees-Mogg presenting the programme motion to the Commons on Monday\n\nWhat is in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?\n\nThe 110-page document will give legal effect to the withdrawal deal negotiated by Mr Johnson.\n\nHis plan ditches the backstop - the controversial measure designed to prevent a return to physical checks on the Irish border.\n\nInstead it essentially draws a new customs border in the Irish Sea, as goods which could travel onwards to Ireland will have to pay a duty tax.\n\nIt also will see the whole of the UK leave the EU customs union, meaning it could strike trade deals with other countries in the future.\n\nThe WAB will also turn any agreed transition period into law, fulfil requirements on the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit, and allow ministers to make \"divorce payments\" to the EU foreseen under the current deal.\n\nBut MPs will be able to vote on amendments - changes or add-ons - to the bill.\n\nIf the government cannot get the bill through Parliament, the default legal position is for the UK to leave without a deal on 31 October, but that will change if the EU grants an extension.\n\nBoris Johnson's Brexit deal\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nKEY POINTS: What's new in the deal?\n\nPEOPLE'S VIEW: Do voters support the deal?\n\nEXPLAINED: What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?\n\nIN GRAPHICS: What happens now?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Brexit: What actually happened on Saturday?\n\nTuesday's votes come after Mr Johnson failed to get the agreement he reached with the EU last week signed off in the Commons on Saturday.\n\nMPs instead backed an amendment withholding their approval until the bill has faced the scrutiny of both the Commons and the Lords and been passed into law.\n\nThe amendment worked alongside the so-called Benn Act, which required the prime minister to ask the EU for an extension to the 31 October deadline to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\n\nFollowing Saturday's developments, Mr Johnson sent an unsigned letter asking for the delay, along with a signed letter saying why he did not agree with any further delays.\n\nThere has been no official word from the EU yet on whether the bloc will grant a delay or what length it would be.\n\nMr Tusk said the result of his consultation with EU leaders \"will very much depend on what the British parliament decides or doesn't decide\".\n\nDo you have any questions about the Brexit bill and what happens next?\n\nUse this form to ask your question:\n\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.
