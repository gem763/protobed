Reaching the end of the range, he wheels around and takes a lower pass, the plane\u2019s sensors sampling the air between the clouds and their shadows on the patchwork farmland below. A former bush pilot now working for the Department of Energy, Eveland has flown through just about every type of cloud the planet has to offer: sprawling stratus decks above the Alaskan tundra, atmospheric rivers flowing toward the coast of California, low ocean haze in the Azores, and orange pyrocumulus plumes sent up by firestorms in Washington state (which he describes as a \u201choot\u201d). Eveland likens skimming along the Argentine mountains to surfing, though every time he says something like that, he\u2019s quick to boast about his caution. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like Twister. We don\u2019t just drive around looking for bad stuff to happen,\u201d he says in his Arkansan twang. \u201cOur sensors have sensors.\u201d Laughing, he gestures to a plastic hula girl suctioned to the cockpit dashboard. \u201cAnd when she falls off, it\u2019s time to go home.\u201d Eveland is part of a team of about 60 people who have come to Argentina\u2019s C\u00f3rdoba province to chase the clouds. In the back of the plane are four scientists who enjoy the flights somewhat less than Eveland does; staring at instrument displays as the plane pitches and rolls, someone always throws up. On the ground, other researchers are readying weather balloons and preparing heavy blue trucks mounted with radar dishes. If all goes according to plan, later today, they will capture a high-fidelity picture of the birth, life, and death of a cloud. Not only are clouds complex, but there isn\u2019t much data on them\n\nClimate change has made gathering such data an urgent matter. Clouds play a profound role in the climate system: some types block sunlight, cooling the Earth, while others act as greenhouse gasses and heat it. Yet no one knows exactly how the clouds will behave as the climate warms. Ever since scientists started running climate models in the late 1960s, clouds have remained the largest single source of uncertainty about just how hot the Earth will get in response to carbon dioxide. They are a major part of the reason why scientists give predictions about the future climate as a range: about 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit if carbon dioxide concentrations rise to twice their preindustrial levels, which is a point we are on track to reach by mid-century. It\u2019s a margin of error that runs from bad to catastrophic \u2014 the difference between billions more people subjected to deadly heat, between damaged coral reefs and the end of them, between the inundation of not just Miami but of Osaka, Shanghai, Kolkata as well. There are signs that clouds hide even more dangerous tripwires. Earlier this year, Tapio Schneider at the California Institute of Technology simulated the sprawling banks of stratocumulus clouds that currently blanket the oceans. When he tripled the level of carbon dioxide, the clouds abruptly disintegrated. Global temperature shot up 14 degrees, reaching a point last seen 55 million years ago, when crocodiles swam in the Arctic. \u201cIt was shocking, my God,\u201d Schneider says. \u201cThere are unknown unknowns, things that people didn\u2019t think could happen because climate models don\u2019t capture it, but in reality they might happen. We need to get these models better fast.\u201d The cloud problem has remained unsolved in part because clouds are astonishingly complex, made up of trillions of microscopic droplets swirling about chaotically. Modeling even a single one at high resolution requires the fastest supercomputers in the world; modeling a planet\u2019s worth will be beyond our capabilities for decades. We would get the answer too late. Dave Randall, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University, calls it an \u201cinfinite problem,\u201d like trying to simulate a human being down to the individual cells. It is \u201cthe Higgs Boson of the theory of climate, and climate change,\u201d The World Climate Research Programme wrote in a call for cloud research. \u201cIt is the intellectual and experimental challenge of our lifetime.\u201d Not only are clouds complex, but there isn\u2019t much data on them. Useful satellite records go back only to the 1970s, and even then, they only provide a view of the cloud tops, not what\u2019s happening beneath them. Gathering the necessary data requires airplanes, balloons, and all manner of radars and lasers, as well as solving a more basic problem: if clouds defy prediction, how do you know where and when to set everything up? The scientists in Argentina have been becalmed for days, waiting for something to happen. As bored people often do, they passed the time by chatting about the weather, periodically gazing out the windows of the hotel where they had set up their headquarters and confirming that the weather was still, regrettably, nice: blue skies, 80s, a bit muggy in the afternoons. Picking over the breakfast buffet, they lamented the layer of hot, dry air that was preventing storms from forming and talked wistfully about a zone of low pressure spinning off the coast of Chile, which the forecaster has given the Godzilla-like moniker \u201cMega Trough.\u201d Today, it is expected to approach the coast. At the morning briefing, the mission\u2019s forecaster tells the scientists that there is a high likelihood of lightning, hail, and flooding. There are murmurs of excitement across the hotel conference room. As Eveland flies laps through the clouds overhead, the researchers hurry to get ready for the storm.\n\nYou created group \u201cRELAMPAGO Ops\u201d RELAMPAGO Ops: \u200eMessages to this group are now secured with end-to-end encryption. Steve Nesbitt: Here\u2019s a song for you\u2026 Thunderstruck by AC/DC\n\nThere are 10 basic types of clouds, according to the International Cloud Atlas, which can be further subdivided into 15 species. Each of the scientists in Argentina has their favorite. Lenticularis, a lens-like cloud formed by air passing over mountains and often mistaken for flying saucers, is a popular one, as are mammatus, the orb-like protrusions that form beneath powerful storm clouds. But the favorite by far is the cumulonimbus, the thunderhead, the tallest and most violent cloud, flinger of hail, shooter of lightning, spawner of tornadoes, and the origin of the phrase \u201ccloud nine,\u201d for the page it filled in an early edition of the Cloud Atlas, and because it can touch the heavens. The thunderhead is what they are here to chase. A cumulonimbus is a convective cloud, forming when hot air rises and the moisture in it condenses onto dust and organic matter floating in the air. Imagine a boiling pot, one of the researchers in Argentina explained. Instead of the burner, you have the sun heating the ground. The rising bubbles are the clouds. The first to appear is the cumulus, the archetypal benign puffball cloud of cartoons. Often, it will simply hang there until it evaporates, but if the air is hot and humid, the cloud will keep bubbling upward to the tropopause, the lid about 10 miles up beneath which most of our weather occurs. The cloud splashes against this limit, forming a cumulonimbus\u2019s characteristic \u201canvil.\u201d To continue the cooking analogy, it\u2019s now reached a roiling boil. Lightning flashes, and cloud droplets swept aloft by immense updrafts freeze and fuse into hailstones. The process can be as powerful as an atomic bomb. And this sparsely populated stretch of riverside resorts and cattle ranches on the Argentine Pampas has some of the best cumulonimbus in the world. Steve Nesbitt, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois and one of the co-leaders of the mission, has been eyeing the region since he was in graduate school 20 years ago, when he watched his adviser pore over satellite imagery in search of the most intense storms on Earth. Some confluence of atmospheric currents and geography causes puffy cumulus clouds to form and explode into ferocious storms with unusual frequency. And what storms! Cloud tops that touch the stratosphere, lightning flashing more than a hundred times a second, hail the size of cantaloupes, Nesbitt says.\n\nThe hail in particular was notorious for wrecking buildings, cars, and crops. Days before, hail had bashed in the nose cone of a passing airline on its way to Santiago. (When I rented a car to follow the storm chasers, the clerk offered insurance for all manner of destruction except, he emphasized, hail.) A storm in 2015 lasted only 45 minutes, but it was seared into the memory of a local weather watcher: a calm morning, cool air, and then a sudden deluge of ice. \u201cThe town was divided in two,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a total disaster. More than 300 cars destroyed. Flooding because hail clogged the street drains and made blocks of ice. The roofs of houses were collapsing under the weight.\u201d Nesbitt, who grew up enraptured by lake effect snow in upstate New York and still has a boyish enthusiasm for extreme weather, knew he had to get here. Like Nesbitt and many others on the mission, Adam Varble, a scientist with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the campaign\u2019s other co-leader, has been entranced by storms from a young age. In his case, it was watching thunderstorms roll across the plains in southeast Wisconsin. But where Nesbitt\u2019s enthusiasm comes off as languidly awestruck, Varble is all meticulous intensity. For him, the appeal of C\u00f3rdoba\u2019s storms is not their violence, but their dependability \u2014 that the spot is a \u201cnatural cloud laboratory.\u201d\n\nThe challenging thing about clouds is that they are both very large and very small. Clouds cover two-thirds of the planet, but if they all fell to Earth, they would form a puddle no deeper than a human hair. Varble is preoccupied with clouds at the smallest scale, a realm that is paradoxical and poorly understood. Explaining a process as seemingly simple as rain sends him off on spiraling caveats: about the way cloud droplets can remain liquid at temperatures far colder than freezing, how they can suddenly freeze and explode, how their shards interact chaotically with neighboring droplets, and how it all gets very, very complicated. These small-scale processes determine much of cloud behavior, which, in turn, has a profound influence on the climate system.\n\nExploding Cloud Drops Cloud microphysics are fiendishly complex. Droplets can remain in liquid form at temperatures far below freezing (a state called \u201csupercooled\u201d), only turning to ice when they come into contact with an impurity like dust, salt, bacteria, or ice. When droplets freeze, they can detonate, and their shards can strike other droplets, causing a cascade of freezing called \u201cglaciation.\u201d Whether droplets are liquid or frozen \u2014 and if frozen, what shapes they take (plates, pillars, dendrites) \u2014 affects what type of cloud forms, whether it rains, and how much sunlight it reflects. Above is a slow-motion video of a supercooled drizzle droplet after it\u2019s touched by a silver iodide pin.\n\nMost models used to predict future climate, however, work by dividing the Earth into grids of 100 kilometers to a side. Capturing small-scale cloud processes would require computers billions of times more powerful than anything available today, so researchers around the world are racing to find other ways to bring down the resolution: nesting fine-grained cloud models inside coarser global ones, simulating clouds with machine learning, and searching for new rules and patterns in cloud behavior. For any approach, more data on clouds is needed, but measuring floating, always-changing clouds presents challenges of its own. The sheer variety of instruments shipped in for the Argentina mission is a testament to its difficulty. There\u2019s the plane, festooned with sensors, its wings hanging with golden prongs, razor-sharp to capture frozen cloud droplets without shattering those nearby. But the plane can only capture a narrow slice of the cloud, Varble says, and it must turn back if hail begins to form. A satellite will target the area during the operation, but it can only see the cloud tops. High on a desolate ridge to the west, the scientists have built a fortress of sensors and shipping containers: a white volleyball radar housing, lasers pointing straight up, an upturned trapezoid emitting digital chirps measuring windspeed, a rifle-like turret tracking the Sun, a thin metal chimney sucking in air and sampling the particles floating in it, a camera that photographs individual falling raindrops, a mirrored dome measuring the portion of the sky covered in clouds. When I visited the site with Varble the day before, it felt like stepping onto a moonbase, all the devices swiveling and chirping, each one measuring a different aspect of the clouds but, Varble lamented, none giving a full picture.\n\nThe researchers also have a convoy of mobile radars and other vehicles with which to catch their cloud. They stayed up the night before figuring out a plan, moving their units around satellite maps like pieces on a game board. Along the highway in front of the ridge where models said a storm might form, they placed pickup trucks with mast-like weather sensors on their hoods. Behind them, they stationed three heavy-duty flatbeds with spinning Doppler radar dishes. Other teams will scatter sensors in ditches and fields, completing the net. Finally, three teams armed with weather balloons will take measurements of the air. If a storm forms, the hope is that one will be close enough to chase it and throw a balloon into the cloud itself. Varble will stay in the hotel conference room with a dozen other scientists, watching satellite feeds and helping direct the operation over WhatsApp. Nesbitt, after weeks of managing logistics from the hotel, will take a turn in the field, leading one of the balloon teams. The sky is still blue as the vans, trucks, and radars file out of the field behind the hotel where they had been parked. Their truck loaded up with helium tanks and balloons, Nesbitt and three grad students start driving south. The mood is tense. Any moment could bring an update saying a storm had formed at the wrong place or time and the mission is scrapped, or that they have to race to salvage it. To break the tension, Nesbitt drops a song into the operation\u2019s WhatsApp group: AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck.\u201d\n\nKaren Kosiba: Go for mission today. Sounding lat/lons coming soon. Steve Nesbitt: Roger that Steve Nesbitt: P.S. I\u2019m really excited for today\u2019s mission\n\nEveland is flying laps along the ridge, diving in and out of the building clouds, which have grown from stray puffs to cotton candy plumes. Weather prediction is cyborg work. Computer models are invaluable, but they must be weighed against other models and trued by people with experience of how they\u2019ve performed. Sensors provide important information about what the atmosphere is doing, but they must be supplemented with simple visual observation, and few clues are as important as clouds. Eveland is self-deprecating about his knowledge of clouds, saying he never knew they went by so many names until he started flying the scientists. But he knows what to look for. \u201cI always thought there were just fluffy, nice clouds and mean, angry clouds,\u201d he jokes. Mean, angry ones look like a fist with knuckles, their crispness a sign of their power. He gives those a wide berth; they mark updrafts that can flip a plane and fling hailstones for 20 miles. The clouds to his south, back by the airport, were looking angry. He\u2019d been watching them grow taller all morning, and now he could see the hazy white splash of a cumulonimbus\u2019s anvil high in the atmosphere. Varble had been watching the storm, too, from the satellite feed on his laptop back at the command center. Fearing the plane would be cut off, he tells Eveland to head for home.\n\nAs Eveland speeds back toward the airport, clouds unfurl around him, and the sky takes on a sepia tint. The plane starts bucking even more than usual. He comes in to land, noting the ripples in the fields below indicating that the wind had begun to shift ahead of the storm. He hits the tarmac and makes for the hanger. Hail peppers the runway not long after. But back in the operation zone to the north, the sky is still blue. The researchers have driven their radar trucks into position, anchored them with steel struts, and pointed their dishes at the ridge where they expect a storm will form. Now, there is nothing to do but wait. Nesbitt\u2019s truck is parked in a field along the side of a two-lane highway, in front of a large, unassembled radar that was shipped in the week before. When I drive up, he is lounging in the shade beneath the bed of his truck, watching the clouds through mirrored sunglasses. Insects whir, and the field shimmers with heat. Days of weather simulations have brought the researchers to this point, but cloud droplets are too small to be picked up by radar, and models can\u2019t predict exactly where and when a cloud will form and grow into a storm. From here onward, they will have to rely on their eyes. \u201cThe clouds are like fingerprints,\u201d Nesbitt says, pointing to the clouds along the ridge. \u201cYou can read them and instantly see what\u2019s happening in the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nTo him, the static scene is full of action: clouds \u201cpop\u201d and \u201cbubble,\u201d signs of tremendous energy and continent-scale atmospheric flows. Hot, wet air rising off the ridge is ripe for development into a powerful storm, but it\u2019s being blocked by a layer of warm, dry air aloft. It needs a push. Maybe that will come as the sun continues to beat down and heat the ground, or maybe it will come from the approaching line of innocuous-looking cloud puffs to the south. Those clouds, Nesbitt says, are the result of the storm Eveland had just dodged, now visible as a sprawling white flying saucer in the distance. Its falling rain and hail have cooled the air beneath it, creating what\u2019s called a \u201ccold pool\u201d \u2014 that blast of chilled wind that hits you before a storm. The cold pool is sliding north along the ground, pushing hot air up to form that line of clouds, and maybe, Nesbitt says, it will trigger a storm somewhere this afternoon. This is a process not captured by current models, the way one storm can cause others dozens of miles away, so researchers have to fill in the gaps. \u201cMost meteorologists who are any good have this kind of sixth sense about this,\u201d Nesbitt says. The researchers are also aided by locals who, like people everywhere, have their own weather lore. On a farm 50 miles to the south is a 28-year-old farmer\u2019s son named Mat\u00edas Lenard\u00f3n who became obsessed with cloud formations and storms after lightning struck his house when he was five. In high school, he grew so frustrated with the lack of local weather data that he built a weather station and recorded its observations for the next 10 years without missing a single day. The radio station in C\u00f3rdoba now calls on him for morning forecasts before his shift at the granary, and he helped the researchers place their sensors on his family\u2019s farm. Nesbitt says Lenard\u00f3n reminded him of himself as a kid.\n\nLenard\u00f3n uses models and satellite data, but it\u2019s the decade he spent watching the weather that gives him his edge. He knows, for instance, that if the models show a possibility of a storm in the afternoon, fog in the morning and clouds with a greenish tint mean it will be a strong one, and that lately they have been getting stronger, and forming faster, and coming from the mountains in the north rather than the plains to the south, as they used to. People have used clouds this way for millennia, developing rules and rhymes about what they foretell about future weather. Think of \u201cred sky at night, sailor\u2019s delight,\u201d or the dappled cloudlets of a \u201cmackerel sky\u201d signaling rain. It\u2019s not a far leap from there, especially for people whose livelihoods are closely tied to the weather, to seeing in the clouds not just meteorological signs but divine ones. It\u2019s a quality that cuts across history and cultures: clouds acting as the tools of deities from Zeus to Indra, leading the Jews out of Egypt in Exodus, ubiquitous in Christian art as the abode of God and saints. Today, this role is given a secular revision in various conspiracy theories, from weather modification to airplane contrails. (As often happens, the theorists are part right and completely wrong: we are changing the weather, and clouds play a major part, even contrails, which have a significant warming effect.) Varble encounters theories like these wherever he\u2019s working, and he always tries to do lots of community outreach in part to forestall rumors that something nefarious is happening with the US Department of Energy trucks that are parked on remote roads at odd hours, monitoring the clouds. In Colorado, park rangers told him to turn off a laser because it was turning the clouds green and freaking people out. Here in Argentina, as soon as the researchers arrived, they received an email with dozens of photos alleging the region\u2019s strange clouds are the work of aliens. \u201cNobody\u2019s coming to save us. The Earth isn\u2019t going to save itself. It\u2019s really up to us.\u201d It\u2019s fitting, then, that we\u2019re now looking to the clouds to see what the future holds, and maybe it\u2019s these prophetic associations that make news of their changes so eerie. This summer saw thunderstorms near the North Pole and outbreaks of a rare type of shimmering nighttime cloud over Europe and the United States. Whether these noctilucent clouds have an impact on climate is unclear, but they are linked to increasing emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, making them a stark reminder that the changes underway extend to the upper atmosphere, and will be as inescapable as the clouds. Other clouds appear to be changing in ways that are subtler but more ominous where climate is concerned. Since the 1980s, they have been migrating toward the poles where they will reflect less sunlight and amplify warming. They also appear to be moving higher in the atmosphere, which will worsen warming, too. The low stratus clouds that drift into California from the Pacific have been growing sparser since the 1970s, likely worsening droughts and wildfires. \u201cClouds were kind of our last hope,\u201d says Kate Marvel from NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. They were the only real contender for a protective mechanism that might kick in and dampen the effects of climate change. But the more we learn, the more it looks like they could make things worse. \u201cNobody\u2019s coming to save us,\u201d Marvel says. \u201cThe Earth isn\u2019t going to save itself. It\u2019s really up to us.\u201d\n\nKaren Kosiba: UI2: Please go South on the rio tecero road to rio tecero and await further instructions (please keep collecting data) Russ Schumacher: copy. prepping for launch nbow Russ Schumacher: *now\n\nIt is almost three in the afternoon, right around when the models said a storm would form. Conditions seem right for something to happen: the air is getting hotter and more humid, and the cold pool is sliding in from the south. Then the radars pick up a strange signal: a cloud of something flying toward them, too uniform in size to be precipitation. \u201cIt has to be biological,\u201d says one of the radar operators. It is, in fact, biological: a swarm of locusts riding the northerly jet out of the Amazon. The enormous insects started appearing several days before, and the bored researchers had taken to measuring them with their hail rulers. They represented another bit of weather lore: locals said their arrival signaled a coming storm. The question was where it would form. In the hotel conference room, Varble notices the clouds above the sensor site on the ridge are rapidly growing thicker. He switches over to the site\u2019s cameras and sees clouds flowing in from the ridgetop, sliding across the blue sky like a stadium roof. At the same time, the satellite shows the line of clouds 50 miles to the southeast, triggered by the airport storm, deepening. Either spot seems ripe for a storm. Karen Kosiba is coordinating the operation. A scientist with the Center for Severe Weather Research, she\u2019d chased tornadoes and ridden out hurricanes atop levees long after everyone else evacuated, and here in Argentina, she\u2019d studied the roads and fields that would now become the redoubts and escape routes for the researchers. There\u2019s a game-like quality to managing a campaign, she says, and now it was time to start putting her pieces in play.\n\nRuss Schumacher, an upbeat atmospheric science professor from Colorado State University, had been waiting in a dusty field, sending weather balloons up every hour. Kosiba tells his crew to head south toward the line of clouds. Their mission is to get a weather balloon into an updraft, the rising hot air that gives storms their power. It\u2019s a difficult task: you have to get under a storm and throw the balloon so that it catches the air currents and gets sucked into the cloud, all without getting hit by hail. Schumacher had boasted earlier that the two graduate students with him were some of the best updraft hunters around. Time to prove it. The three of them hop in their van and drive out of the parched field, dust devils eddying in their wake, toward the road that will take them south. Nesbitt\u2019s mission had been to take balloon readings in the cold pool behind the line of clouds, but he\u2019s taken a break on his way south and is eating ice cream at a gas station in the town of R\u00edo Tercero. With Schumacher still 40 minutes away, Kosiba sees a chance to grab an updraft sample. She gives Nesbitt a new mission: stop eating ice cream, and throw a balloon into one of the deepening clouds heading his way. Nesbitt\u2019s team piles into the truck and heads west. He has goosebumps and tells himself to slow down as he drives through the sun-bleached pastel shops of R\u00edo Tercero. As they leave town, they see that the clouds ahead of them have grown tall enough to block the sun, casting shifting shadows on the fields. \u201cTarget in sight,\u201d Nesbitt relays over WhatsApp. The road begins to curve away from the clouds, and Nesbitt pulls onto the shoulder. It isn\u2019t an ideal spot \u2014 there is a barbed wire fence and power lines, which could snare his balloon \u2014 but the clouds are floating north and will soon be out of range. Nesbitt\u2019s team inflates the balloon as gusts ripple across the field. When the balloon reaches the size of an exercise ball, Nesbitt unhooks it, walks to the fence, and shoves it clear of the powerlines. Its sensor swinging, the balloon drifts up and then curves sharply north, caught in the updraft, and is sucked into the underbelly of the darkening cloud.\n\nHuddling around their laptop, the team watches as the readings for humidity and temperature converge: they\u2019d made it into the cloud. Their detour a success, Nesbitt\u2019s team jumps back in their truck and hurries south before the storm can break. Back at the hotel, Varble watches the cameras at the hilltop site. He sees one cloud along the ridge bubble upward then subside, only to have another one appear two miles east, as if it had teleported. At first, the scientists think this cloud, too, will fade. But it shoots upward and keeps going. Its top freezes and grows hazy, forming an anvil. Varble alerts the field teams that a storm has formed not on the plains, as they had expected, but farther north along the ridge. Kosiba tells the radars to start scanning the area. It\u2019s bad luck for Schumacher, who had just driven under that cloud on his way south. Kosiba tells him to turn around and try to get ahead of it. As he passes under the cloud once more, hail clatters off his windshield. As Schumacher is driving, the storm explodes upward with such force that it punches through the tropopause and forms a white dome in the stratosphere. The researchers in the ops center watch the satellite feed as the cloud pushes into the jet stream, sending out a frozen wake like a rock in a fast-flowing river. A few researchers leave their desks and run to the hotel\u2019s rooftop deck, where the cloud is now visible over the mountains as a bright white cliff. It has taken only 20 minutes to go from a benign cumulus to a \u201csupercell,\u201d an extremely powerful thunderstorm that can move in unpredictable ways.\n\nNow north of the storm, Schumacher pulls onto a dirt road and starts inflating a balloon, but the storm lurches east. His team jumps back in the van and gives chase. They bounce down the rutted road as the storm churns ahead of them, drawing up twisting ropes of dust. Kosiba alerts them that it has begun to show tornado-like rotation. \u201cWe\u2019re trying our best to catch it,\u201d Schumacher replies. \u201cNot sure we\u2019ll be able to.\u201d He comes to a stop once more. His students start inflating the balloon. One of them unhooks it from the nozzle and runs to the middle of the road, holding the balloon over his head with both hands as it pulls and distends in the wind. He lets go, but once again, the storm jumps away, and the balloon sails north into a sky that is already patched with blue. But in veering away from Schumacher, the storm flies directly through the line of radar trucks that have been waiting since the morning. The researchers inside secure their doors as it approaches and triple-check their radars. Hovering above the plain, the storm looks like a dark jellyfish, the sky around it blue, but everything beneath it is hazy with hail and dust and lit by strobes of lightning. The radars are in the perfect position to scan its heart as it passes over, pelting the trucks with dirt and vegetation. As it cuts between the two southernmost radars, baseball-sized hail hammers the new radar Nesbitt had lounged in front of two hours earlier, bashing craters into its pristine shell. And like that, the storm is gone, churning east, leaving tattered scud clouds drifting along the ground, and dark shapes keeling at odd angles in the sky. The air is cooler and smells of copper and cut grass. \u201cThat thing was generating the biggest dust storm/haboob I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Schumacher writes in WhatsApp. Nesbitt drives north and runs into Schumacher, and the two teams head back toward headquarters, watching new clouds build and darken and move off the mountains to their west. The scientists at the hotel direct the drivers to pause, then drive, then pause, as they frogger through the drifting storms. A lowering funnel cloud appears to their left and Nesbitt considers giving chase, but the message comes back from headquarters to return home: they\u2019d gotten everything they need.\n\nSteve Nesbitt: It\u2019s looking \u201clit\u201d from the south Jim Marquis: Execellent data collection today, everyone! Jeff Trapp: thanks indeed!\n\nBack at the hotel, the researchers marvel at their luck, replaying the satellite feed and congratulating the field teams filing in, dusty, exhausted, and smiling. Schumacher\u2019s updraft balloons had missed, but Nesbitt had scored a lucky hit during his detour earlier in the afternoon. Luckier still, the storm had formed right above the hilltop site, in range of its dozens of sensors. It then traveled through the center of the mobile radar network. It might be one of the best recorded supercells ever, Nesbitt says. \u201cPhD theses will be written about this storm for decades.\u201d They could slice the cloud any number of ways. At its peak, it was about 25 miles across and poured down 1.6 million gallons of water per minute, more than enough to fill two Olympic-sized swimming pools. Floating above the plains, it contained 10 trillion drops of water and ice, including hailstones the size of tennis balls, thrown six miles above the Earth by 90 mile-per-hour updrafts. Once they checked the radar, the researchers could see that the swirls of dust they had witnessed were created by vortices just shy of meeting the windspeed definition of a tornado. (Still unclear to the researchers: why did it teleport off the mountain? What, ultimately, caused this cloud and not the others to grow into a storm?) There were, in total, about 10 terabytes of data on its 3.5-hour life, too much to simply upload. It would have to be put on a hard drive, carried by hand onto a plane, and taken back to the lab where, the hope was, other scientists would use it to untangle the mysteries of cloud behavior or train their models to mimic it. At his most ambitious, Varble\u2019s hopes for what this research might accomplish can seem modest. \u201cIf we could help someone bring down the uncertainty by half a degree, help people adapt a bit, that would be worthwhile,\u201d he says.\n\nHow Clouds Affect Climate 1. Basics Clouds both cool the Earth by reflecting sunlight and warm it by absorbing infrared radiation from the planet\u2019s surface. Depending on a cloud\u2019s thickness, height, and reflectivity, one effect will win out over the other, resulting in a net warming or cooling. 2. High clouds High clouds are expected to move higher as the climate warms, where they will emit less heat into space, worsening warming. 3. Low clouds Low clouds reflect a great deal of sunlight, and how they will change is a major wildcard. Satellite observations and models suggest that a warming planet will cause these clouds to thin and break up. 4. Poleward movement Clouds appear to be moving toward the poles, where they will reflect less solar radiation, warming the Earth. 5. Changing rainfall As cloud patterns change, rainfall zones are expected to both shrink and shift. For some regions, this will mean drought; for others, floods.", "description": "Clouds are complex, elusive, and the greatest source of uncertainty about how hot the Earth will get in response to carbon dioxide.
