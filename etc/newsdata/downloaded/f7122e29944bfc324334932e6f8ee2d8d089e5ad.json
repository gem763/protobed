And that would also take him out of consideration for the World Series roster should the Yankees manage to complete a miracle comeback from a 3-1 series deficit.\n\nSabathia had come back in 2019 for one last shot at another championship ring.\n\nHe fought through various injuries \u2014 both to his shoulder and knee \u2014 to get this far. He didn\u2019t deserve for it to end this way.\n\n\u201cHe leaves it all on the field,\u201d Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the severity of what\u2019s going on with him, but you can never say that man never gave his all. Every single time he went out here you had to rip the ball and rip his jersey off to get him off that mound.\n\n\u201cHe got everything out of that arm. That\u2019s a warrior right there. That\u2019s why he\u2019s been the leader of this team for so many years and why he has so much respect around the game and in this stadium. And it was tough to see, but that\u2019s our leader and he left it all out there.\u201d\n\nThink about this: Sabathia is MLB\u2019s active leader in wins, inning pitched, starts, strikeouts, complete games, home runs allowed, walks, hits allowed, losses, earned runs allowed, hit by pitches and batters faced.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd according to baseball researcher Katie Sharp, he is one of only three pitchers with 250 wins, 3,000 strikeouts, a Cy Young award and a postseason (LCS or WS) MVP. The others: Bob Gibson and Randy Johnson.\n\nNew York Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia's career is likely over after a shoulder injury in ALCS Game 4. (Brad Penner/USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d Yankees center fielder Aaron Hicks said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great person, great player, and obviously he\u2019s going to be a Hall of Famer. He means a lot to this team, this organization, and to see him go out like that, it\u2019s not something you want.\u201d\n\nAt his peak, Sabathia put the Milwaukee Brewers on his back in 2008 and carried them into the playoffs, risking a massive payday by pitching on short rest. The Yankees ultimately backed up the money truck in the offseason \u2014 to the tune of seven years, $161 million \u2014 and he rewarded them by dealing in October en route to his only title.\n\n\u201cThe New York Yankees would not have their 27th World Championship without him,\u201d former teammate Alex Rodriguez said on Fox as he was on the verge of tears. \u201cAnd I love him like a brother. I thank him for our world championship. In 2009 when he came here, he changed the paradigm shift of our entire team, the clubhouse and the franchise. The Yankees became the No. 1 team in baseball because of CC Sabathia.\u201d\n\nThere were several highs and lows from there. All-Star appearances, knee surgeries and cortisone shots. A trip to rehab to get his alcohol problem under control. And Sabathia also reinvented himself on the mound, learning how to finesse his way through outings as his velocity abandoned him.\n\nSabathia was a leader on and off the field. He chirped his opponents, and Yankees fans absolutely loved him for it. So did his teammates. But 56,537 regular-season pitches and 2,292 postseason pitches later, his body reached its breaking point.\n\nHe appeared to favor his shoulder after making a 1-1 pitch to Astros center fielder George Springer with two outs in the eighth. Yankees manager Aaron Boone and trainer Steve Donahue immediately came out to visit him. Sabathia tried to throw a warmup pitch but that was it.\n\nHe exited to a standing ovation as he walked off the field. But he was downtrodden. It wasn\u2019t supposed to end like this.\n\nStill, CC Sabathia is a warrior. A deserving Hall of Famer, too. And no one will ever be able to take that away from him.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "CC Sabathia's illustrious career likely came to an end on Thursday after he suffered a left shoulder injury in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series.", "authors": ["Mike Mazzeo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zBf7eODW3WF6qG2gv9Xqyg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0dhns.NYz2o0i0rzYxrKjg--~B/aD0yODg3O3c9NDMzMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/db652900-f16d-11e9-8bf6-6e3775f6dfd7", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
