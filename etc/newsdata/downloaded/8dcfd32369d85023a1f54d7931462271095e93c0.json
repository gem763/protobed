Cohen this week announced that his firm, the Cohen Group, assisted by the law firm DLA Piper Global, will conduct an independent review to determine whether the EPA acted fairly.\n\nCohen has been retained by the Pebble Limited Partnership, developers of the proposed mine that has become the focus of environmentalist angst.\n\nCohen will evaluate the fairness of the EPA\u2019s actions and decisions in its contentious process based upon a \u201cthorough assessment of the facts and informed by his experience as Secretary of Defense as well as his 24 years as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate,\u201d according to a press release. He will have full discretion as to the \u201cmeans and manner\u201d of carrying out the review to \u201censure that it is thorough and unbiased.\u201d\n\nThe EPA is the subject of an investigation by its own Office of Inspector General, as well as inquiries and hearings by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. More recently, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has questioned the EPA\u2019s move to preemptively kill a copper and gold mine project that would create thousands of jobs before PLP has the opportunity to present its full plan to regulators.\n\nDocuments obtained under Freedom of Information Act requests raise serious questions about the EPA\u2019s conduct.\n\nCohen said a condition of his accepting the review is he will have complete independence in following the evidence wherever it may lead.\n\n\u201cI have agreed to undertake this effort after reviewing a wide range of available documents, including those produced in response to FOIA requests, that persuaded me that legitimate questions exist which merit an in-depth, independent review,\u201d he said. \u201cTo ensure a comprehensive and unbiased evaluation, I welcome hearing from, and will be reaching out to, interested stakeholders, and I will carefully consider all points of view. I invite those who have information relating to the issues under review to meet with my team so that we might receive all relevant information for consideration.\u201d\n\nPLP has long said it welcomes a thorough review of their proposals, but they want the opportunity to present the information through due process, which they believe has been denied via the EPA\u2019s preemptive push to kill the project.\n\n\u201cOur message is about standing up for fair and due process,\u201d PLP spokesman Mike Heatwole told Watchdog last August.\n\nIn July, EPA unveiled a proposed list of crippling restrictions that could severely limit development of the proposed Pebble Mine project in Alaska\u2019s bush country, an operation that developers say would create 1,000 direct jobs, and thousands more indirectly, and as much as $180 million in revenue for the state.\n\nThe agency is invoking a section of the Clean Water Act, a section that could allow the EPA to stop the mine proposal before the developers are able to present their plan to state and federal regulatory agencies.\n\n\u201cEPA has never pre-emptively stopped a project in the 42-year history of the Clean Water Act,\u201d Heatwole told KTUU TV in Anchorage Tuesday. \u201cAnd the precedent that would be established outside of the permitting process is of grave concern, not just to Pebble, but all of the statewide trade and business associations, and many national organizations.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s position in Alaska has proved chilling to mine development across the country, the latest being a proposed $1.5 billion iron ore mine in northern Wisconsin, also expected to create good-paying jobs in an economically distressed region of the state.\n\nDennis McLerran, regional administrator for the EPA\u2019s Region 10, has said the dangers of even a smaller mine in the Bristol Bay region\u2019s \u201cfragile ecosystem\u201d would be devastating.\n\nHe told reporters the EPA is trying to protect the world\u2019s largest salmon fishery, where half of the world\u2019s sockeye salmon population is said to live, from what would be \u201cone of the world\u2019s largest open pit mine developments ever conceived of.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we have here is an extraordinarily large mine in an extraordinarily important fisher location,\u201d he told the Anchorage TV station. \u201cSo this is an extraordinary use of authority that we use very infrequently, very sparingly, but we use it when it\u2019s really important.\u201d\n\nPebble filed a lawsuit in May against the agency. In its complaint, the company asserts the EPA doesn\u2019t possess the authority to block or limit the mine.\n\n\u201cHere, nothing in Section 404 of the (Clean Water) Act or elsewhere in the statute suggests that Congress intended for EPA to arrogate to itself an authority that essentially bans an activity \u2014 mining \u2014 before it is even proposed by an applicant,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nEPA officials have said they already have the science to show what a theoretical mine could do to the region. But that science has been blasted as faulty by several experts in peer review.\n\n\u201cThis is a lot bigger than Pebble,\u201d PLP says on its website.\n\n\u201cIf the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is successful in denying Pebble the right to even submit a permit application to undergo state and federal review, it sets a precedent and takes control for zoning away from Alaska. This would give the EPA control over the Alaska economy,\u201d the developer asserts in asking viewers to \u201ctake 30 seconds to send a message to the EPA asking them to stand down and reconsider their (pre-emptive) action.\u201d", "description": "By M.D.Kittle | Watchdog.org\nA former defense secretary in the Clinton .09/02/2019 3:06:04AM EST.", "authors": ["M.D. Kittle", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/http://watchdog.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/william-cohen-300x218.jpg"}
