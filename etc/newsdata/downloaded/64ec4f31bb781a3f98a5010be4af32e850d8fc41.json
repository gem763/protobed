These payments, which started before the tender was awarded and continued throughout the year, amounted to R15m.\n\nMalema and the EFF are accused of taking kickbacks for contracts in Tshwane, where they played kingmaker after the 2016 municipal elections.\n\nAmaBhugane also reported that none of the role players implicated in its investigation provided answers to questions that were put to them.\n\nMokgalapa has asked acting municipal manager Moeketsi Ntsimane to initiate a probe with a particular focus on whether BBT was the suitable company to be awarded the tender, what process was followed to finalise pricing and contracts as well as whether there was any interference by Tshwane senior officials in awarding the tender.\n\nANALYSIS | Tender comrades: When it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck...\n\nNtsimane will also investigate whether concerns raised by some of the bid adjudication members about pricing discrepancies were expressed and addressed appropriately.\n\n\"This will enable the City to establish the facts and implement appropriate consequence management measures,\" Mokgalapa said in a statement.\n\n\"It remains my key priority to provide service delivery to the residents of Tshwane through clean and honest governance that is free from corruption.\"\n\nThe mayor also lashed out at amaBhungane, accusing it of ignoring previous responses provided by the City that detailed reasons behind the awarding of the fuel tender to BBT.\n\nIn the same breath, he also requested that amaBhungane provide the City with prima facie evidence that would assist in proving the allegations.\n\nEFF national spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi could not be immediately reached for comment. His comments will be added once received.", "description": "Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa has ordered an investigation into a three-year tender to provide the municipality with fuel, after allegations of tender irregularities and corruption surfaced.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8958/2ca0d584ca434fd79248234e896fec3c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
