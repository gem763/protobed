The suit focuses on tweets from Musk in which he referred to Unsworth as a \u201cpedo guy\u201d and emails to BuzzFeed journalist Ryan Mac in which Musk directly calls Unsworth a pedophile.\n\nUS District Judge Stephen Wilson has ruled that a jury will determine whether or not those tweets and emails count as recklessly negligent. In July 2018, Unsworth called Musk\u2019s plan to rescue a group of Thai teenagers from an underwater cave using a miniature submarine a \u201cPR stunt\u201d and stated his belief that the submarine would have failed completely to make it through the tight, narrow bends in the underwater cave. \u201cHe can stick his submarine where it hurts,\u201d Unsworth said in an interview. \u201cIt had absolutely no chance of working. He had no conception of what the cave passage was like. The submarine, I believe, was about five foot six long, rigid, so it wouldn\u2019t have gone round corners or round any obstacles. It wouldn\u2019t have made the first 50 meters into the cave from the dive start point. Just a PR stunt.\u201d\n\nMusk claimed that his submarine could easily have navigated the cave, telling Unsworth in a now-deleted tweet: \u201cYou know what, don\u2019t bother showing the video. We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.\u201d In court filings, Unsworth stated that Musk was \u201ca thin-skinned billionaire\u201d with \u201ca history of vindictively and intentionally ignoring truth,\u201d and argued that Musk knew his allegations of pedophilia against Unsworth were false.\n\nMusk hired a private investigator who was a convicted felon to investigate Unsworth who provided little evidence to back up Musk\u2019s claims about Unsworth. Unsworth is now seeking $75,000 in damages an unspecified punitive damages to be determined by a court. Unsworth\u2019s filing stated that Musk\u2019s statements made in depositions and court documents were \u201creplete with untruths and misrepresentations\u201d and contain a number of embarrassing revelations collected in discovery.\n\nMusk outright called Unsworth a \u201cchild rapist\u201d in his emails to BuzzFeed journalist Ryan Mac and stated: \u201cI f*cking hope he sues me.\u201d It appears that Musk\u2019s wish has come true.\n\nFollowing Breitbart News\u2019 previous coverage of Unsworth\u2019s lawsuit against Musk, a spokesperson for Elon Musk\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro of firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP, contacted Breitbart News with this statement: \u201cThis case is nothing but a money-grab in which Unsworth has hired an agent and pursued profit, publicity and self-promotion at every turn. The truth of his motivations and actions will come out soon enough.\u201d\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
