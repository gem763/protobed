And the point was well-taken. I think that because now I\u2019m hearing the Dems have agreed in three weeks that they\u2019re going to open these things to the public. I don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t do it starting now. I guess it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nGrisham went on to say Trump was \u201csupportive\u201d of the House GOP members getting behind him.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Thursday on \"Fox & Friends,\"\u00a0White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham praised the group of House GOP members that successfully stormed and\u00a0shut | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/grisham-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
