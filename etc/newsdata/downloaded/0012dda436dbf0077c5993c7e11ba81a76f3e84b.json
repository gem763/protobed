So did the acidic arguments over the blackout imposed by Pacific Gas & Electric, the state\u2019s largest utility and among its least-liked companies.\n\n\u201cThis is a whole new deal from PG&E,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s amazing to see the power this company has \u2014 scary, really, because there is no recourse.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe utility company\u2019s planned blackout ebbed and flowed Thursday, with some neighborhoods getting electricity back and others waking up to no power at all. And much like the utility itself, business owners and others carried out countless acts of improvisation, adapting on the fly to an expensive inconvenience that could become commonplace as the California climate shifts toward the extremes.\n\nAfter expanding the blackout overnight to some areas, including this town east of Oakland, PG&E began the slow process of inspecting lines in other areas in preparation to flip the switch back on. The company has said it will take days to bring the power back up to all of the more than half a million customers affected.\n\nThe shut-off, which began before dawn Wednesday and has played out in frustrating fits and starts for residents, is a relatively new, if drastic, measure to lessen the threat of wildfires during high-risk weather. Utilities are allowed to cut the power without government approval, though such decisions are reviewed by the state Public Utilities Commission.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut those conditions have not materialized as predicted, leaving many across the region to interpret the blackout as a political act by a company seeking to loosen the state\u2019s strict liability law that holds utilities accountable for any fire their equipment starts. A cool, dry wind blew through the hills of this town Thursday, but at nowhere near the strength forecast just a few days ago.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year, with about $20 billion in claims against it for its role in recent wildfires. One fire last year burned through the hill town of Paradise north of here, killing 85 people and leaving about 14,000 homes in ashes.\n\nThe shut-off, by far the largest ever in California, has drawn sharp criticism from state and local leaders for the economic loss and daily disruptions it has caused. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has said he is \u201coutraged\u201d by the blackouts, which the state government is powerless to prevent.\n\nPG&E said the shut-offs are for safety, and it urged patience.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe understand that this power shut-off is difficult for our customers and communities. Please check on your neighbors, friends and family and know that we will work safely, and quickly as possible, to restore power across the region,\u201d Sumeet Singh, a PG&E vice president, said in a statement on the company\u2019s website.\n\nSouthern California Edison followed PG&E\u2019s lead, cutting power to 13,000 customers in parts of four Central and Southern California counties on Thursday.\n\nThe company said spiking Santa Ana winds, as the high fire-risk breezes are known in the south, prompted the decision. Winds can bring down power lines, which in turn can spark fires. The winds then drive the flames quickly across the tinder-dry landscape, heavy with natural fuel after an unusually wet spring.\n\nThe state\u2019s utility companies have lobbied unsuccessfully for significant changes to the liability law. But Newsom signed legislation earlier this year that establishes a $21 billion emergency fund to help pay for future fire-damage costs. The measure also will loosen some of the liability rules when utility company equipment causes a fire, but only after those utilities carry out billions of dollars in fire-prevention safety work.\n\nAlong Orinda Way, the blackout\u2019s effects played out on a small stage of mini-malls featuring mostly locally owned enterprises. Small-business owners blasted the big-business utility, many saying they might not make rent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlmost every store is closed.\n\nPolice tape is strung across the gas pumps at the Mobil and Shell stations. The Safeway is the only source of food in town, with the insectlike buzz of its generator ringing through the parking lot. Inside, shoppers rolled through half-lit aisles. One wore a miner-style headlamp; another shouted simply, \u201cThis is like an adventure!\u201d\n\nThe shelves inside the store\u2019s aisles of refrigerators are empty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be Cheetos and Fritos for lunch today,\u201d said Hernandez, the hair stylist.\n\nAmong the most frustrating elements of the blackout has been the utility\u2019s inaccurate warnings and, in some cases, lack of warnings at all.\n\nAD\n\nStated times for blackouts have been missed consistently, prompting some businesses to close when it has not been necessary and surprising others by happening without notice.\n\nAD\n\nDipping Nails opened for business Thursday morning just across from Hair 2000.\n\nThe shop had closed the previous day \u2014 canceling dozens of appointments \u2014 after receiving word from PG&E that the power would be off. It was not. But it was cut overnight, and when Vy Nguyen arrived to open up, she was stunned when the lights would not turn on.\n\n\u201cIf they want to shut off the power \u2014 fine,\u201d said Nguyen, the shop manager. \u201cBut they have to tell us the right times so we can plan for it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNguyen said she is losing about $1,000 a day because of the shutdowns and threat of them.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know why they are doing it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re losing a lot, but, of course, we still have to pay the rent.\u201d\n\nCyndi Hilton faced the prospect of missing her rent when, days before the power went out in her consignment and design store in the same mini-mall as Hair 2000, her customers responded to the threat of a shutdown by avoiding the shop.\n\nAD\n\nShe worked behind the dark counter at the back of Hilton House, reading sales sheets and examining a set of earrings with a consulting jeweler by flashlight. Her iPhone played mood music.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very, very slow since this whole thing started,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t sold a thing in days, and the rent is due.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe tried to jump-start her 20-year-old business a few days ago by sending an email to 1,100 customers, saying she is open and that times are tough. Many came in the following morning in a show of support, but with the lights out now, the store is empty.\n\n\u201cPG&E has gotten way too big, and it should be broken up,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cThey hold way too much power over us.\u201d\n\nDavid Blount-Porter, the jeweler, said he believed that was the point of the blackout, to show some of the company\u2019s 16 million customers and state lawmakers just how much leverage the utility has.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like they are saying, \u2018You guys are going to sue us?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201c \u2018Okay, well then, here you go; how do you like this?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nHernandez, at Hair 2000, said the blackout has \u201cforced us to live like we\u2019re back in the old days, but the problem is that we didn\u2019t live in the old days, so we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nDawson, the retired computer scientist getting a haircut, has power at his Walnut Creek home even though PG&E warned it would be cut the previous day. All of his neighbors pulled their cars out of their garages, preparing for electric door openers not to work.\n\n\u201cThis just feels like PG&E exercising its muscles,\u201d Dawson said.", "description": "Pacific Gas & Electric has shut off power to hundreds of thousands to protect against wildfires, but residents say the outages are unpredictable, costly and questionable.", "authors": ["Scott Wilson", "Senior National Correspondent Focusing On California", "The West"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gtri-fNNuXSjcMYHIblG7p-HBWc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/STG54HXLSII6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
