(Photo: REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\nKanye West\u2019s latest Sunday Service performance took a political turn, with the rapper pausing to defend his support of President Trump to fans in Utah.\n\nAs the Deseret News reports, West emerged in Salt Lake City on Oct. 5 to host a Saturday edition of his popular church-inspired gatherins, which coincided with Mormon stronghold\u2019s 189th Semiannual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Though buzz over his forthcoming, oft-delayed new album, Jesus is King, has reached a fever pitch, the 42-year-old star performed an older hit for the thousands of attendees present: \u201cJesus Walks.\u201d\n\nWest, with Trump last October, hit out at critics who questioned his support as a black man.

At one point he warned fans about social media, telling them to \u201cnot read comments on the internet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese people don\u2019t know you like that,\u201d he said. \u201cSocial media is designed to make you think slower ... They want to slow you down and control you.\u201d\n\nWest, who hasn\u2019t tweeted since New Year\u2019s, also railed against social media: \u201cDo not read comments on the Internet. These people don\u2019t know you like that. Social media is designed to make you think slower. ... They want to slow you down and control you\u201d pic.twitter.com/1BGpA5prGt \u2014 Hunter Schwarz (@hunterschwarz) October 5, 2019\n\nHe also turned to politics. It\u2019s been just over one year since West made headlines by delivering an impassioned speech in support of Trump during the Sept. 29, 2018 Season 44 premiere of Saturday Night Live. Just two weeks later, on Oct. 11, he visited Trump at the White House, where he likened his red MAGA cap to a \u201cSuperman cape.\u201d Both moments \u2014 along with his statements earlier that year calling slavery was a \u201cchoice\u201d \u2014 resulted in a fair amount of ridicule and scorn from some fans.\n\nWest, however, remains defiant, according to footage from his Utah gig.\n\nKanye West At Sunday Service Salt Lake City talked about the Republican Party of Lincoln freeing the slaves and how he supports Trump: \u201cI ain\u2019t never made a decision only based on my color. That\u2019s a form of slavery, mental slavery.\u201d pic.twitter.com/0Cwom01ipF \u2014 Hunter Schwarz (@hunterschwarz) October 5, 2019\n\nAfter hailing the Republican Party and Abraham Lincoln for freeing slaves, West fired back at critics who suggested pro-Trump views were at odds with his status as a black man.\n\n\u201cThey try to tell me because of my color who I'm supposed to pick as the president,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201c\u2018You're black, so you can't like Trump.\u2019 I ain't never made a decision only based off my color. That's a form of slavery, mental slavery.\u201d\n\nHe also reportedly hit out at \u201cmind controllers\u201d in the media, then went on to speak out against the incarceration of African-Americans. He pushed for criminal justice reform, an issue wife Kim Kardashian is actively pursuing in collaboration with the Trump administration.\n\nThough West has stayed relatively mum on politics this year, his comments about backing Trump as a black man echo his most recent tweet, dating all the way back to Jan. 1.\n\nOne of my favorite of many things about what the Trump hat represents to me is that people can\u2019t tell me what to do because I\u2019m black \u2014 ye (@kanyewest) January 1, 2019\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
