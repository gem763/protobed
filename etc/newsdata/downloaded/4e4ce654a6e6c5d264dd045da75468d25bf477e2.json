They also listed a lot of cute but not actually weird subreddits. I\u2019ve collected the actually weird ones, plus some of the cute ones. NSFW subreddits are marked as such.\n\nMany of these subreddits were small or abandoned before this Reddit thread, but they\u2019ve been revitalized with fresh new redditors, and you can soak up the sweet new content.\n\nActually Weird\n\nFedlegs (NSFW, for sexy lady pictures): Pictures of women with bare legs, but their legs are yellow. In a post that\u2019s supposed to explain this subreddit, the moderator says: \u201cYears ago, I had a weird recurring science-fiction-esq dream where girls who showed off their legs had them turned yellow by means of a permanent paint.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what level of irony or fiction this subreddit is operating on, and it might be the most actually confusing subreddit on this list.\n\nBreadStapledToTrees: Literally that. Photos of bread stapled to trees. There are new pics every day. Sometimes there are variations, like how the crucifixion of Jesus technically counts, if you believe in transubstantiation.\n\nunexpectedthreefifths: If you see anyone mention the number 3/5, you can show it to this subreddit.\n\nGregfuckedarock (NSFWish for implied sex): Memes about being horny for rocks. There\u2019s some kind of Steven Universe motif and I don\u2019t care to learn why.\n\nDeepIntoYouTube: Weird-arse videos from YouTube\u2019s bargain bin.\n\nLithuaniakittens: A meme subreddit that\u2019s occasionally weird enough to be funny.\n\nOoer: I AM NOT GOOD WITH COMPUTER\n\nooerintensifies: That but more\n\nFourthWorldProblems, FifthWorldProblems, SixthWorldProblems, SeventhWorldProblems, ZerothWorldProblems: All parodies of FirstWorldProblems. See also: SecondWorldProblems and ThirdWorldProblems. It actually goes up way past seven worlds, but I stopped counting after 21stWorldProblems.\n\nSubredditSimulator: Bots try to imitate real Reddit posts. There\u2019s another subreddit with a more advanced algorithm. Both reach a linguistic uncanny valley that will make you worry you\u2019re losing your mind.\n\nBetterHoagieDown: There\u2019s only one post in here. The story, if true, would be tragic and disturbing. But is it true?\n\nlongfurbies: Furbies that have been turned into snakes, sandworms from Dune.\n\nFearMe (NSFW for horror): Legitimately upsetting (but usually not gory) horror fiction images.\n\nhoneyfuckers (NSFW for porn): For people who wanna bang a bee, or wanna joke about banging a bee.\n\nupvoteexeggutor: Honestly more fun than weird, but you deserve a break after the horrors above. This is the only subreddit I\u2019ve seen where all the post images combine to make one long image: Exeggutor, the palm tree Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nNot That Weird, but Good\n\npicturesofiansleeping: Ian\u2019s roommate used to upload pictures of him sleeping. Maybe once I would have found this weird, but I\u2019m on the other side of all those truly bizarre subreddits and frankly I find this one cosy and cute.\n\nWtWFotMJaJtRAtCaB: \u201cWhen the water flows over the milk jug at just the right angle to create a bubble.\u201d Not weird, but relaxing.\n\nVXJunkies: Every hobbyist knows the fun of custom-flitexing your first VX, and the frustration of hemoglobbing the SATDOS into overskid!\n\nHaveWeMet: Of course we met! We\u2019re old friends, [usernamehere]! How\u2019s the fam?\n\ngrandpajoehate: These people really hate Grandpa Joe from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nIsEricWearingShorts: This subreddit tracks whether a certain guy named Eric is wearing shorts or pants every day. According to its sidebar, this subreddit has two internal factions, but not the ones you would guess.\n\nFormerPizzaHuts: It\u2019s pretty easy to spot when a business takes over an old Pizza Hut. What with the roof and all.\n\nI\u2019ve omitted some suggestions that are just weird porn, because frankly weird porn is not hard to come by online.
