The world knew her story; only now do they know her name.\n\nAnd so it is only since revealing the truth in September that Chanel, now 27, has become a \u201cfull person\u201d again. She speaks gently, thoughtfully, her hair neatly curled on the morning we meet in the lobby of a London hotel where she is staying during a visit for Know My Name, the book she has published about her life since those unbelievable 20 minutes five years ago.\n\nA writer and artist, her prose follows in kind; a picture eloquent and vivid, painted in order that she might piece together her story. For she learned that she had been the victim of Brock Turner\u2019s vile assault on the news, a week after the event. Her memory of 15 January 2015 ends at dancing at a party and restarts on waking up on a gurney in a hospital hallway, covered in smatterings of dried blood and bandages, unaware of what occurred in the space between. There, she was told that she had been assaulted, which she was sure must have been some kind of mistake. But only on going to the bathroom and removing her hospital underwear, pine needles from the ground on which she\u2019d been attacked falling from her hair as she bent down, did the first etchings of that night begin to emerge.\n\nThose pine needles would trail after her as the 22-year-old went from hospital room to hospital room wrapped in a blanket; her clothes confiscated, she stood naked for hours as a camera was pointed at her wounded body parts and between her legs. She signed papers that said \u201crape victim.\u201d Three of them worked to brush the pine needles from her hair, which filled a paper bag to the brim.", "description": "Chanel Miller is not, she says, a \u201cperfect victim.", "authors": ["Charlotte Lytton", "Zoe Strimpel", "Bryony Gordon", "Judith Woods", "Shane Watson", "Eleanor Steafel", "Allison Pearson"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2019/10/11/Chanel-Miller-photo-credit-Mariah-Tiffany-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZgEkZX3M936N5BQK4Va8RWtT0gK_6EfZT336f62EI5U.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
