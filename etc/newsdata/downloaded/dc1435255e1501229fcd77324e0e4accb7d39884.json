Netflix has just announced A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby will hit the streaming giant December 5.\n\nI loooooove dumb Christmas movies, but I just couldn\u2019t do A Christmas Prince. I fell asleep. Sorry. So the fact that A Christmas Prince spawned The Royal Wedding and The Royal Baby is just baffling to me.\n\nANYWAY, in this third instalment a priceless Aldovian artefact has been stolen jeopardising a 600-year-old sacred truce between nations. For some reason, it\u2019s Amber\u2018s (Rose McIver) job to find the thief \u201cbefore the clock strikes on Christmas Eve.\u201d Also, she\u2019s pregnant. Hence the title, which apparently has nothing to do with the main plot.\n\nA Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby hits Netflix, December 5.\n\nA Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby premieres Dec. 5 and transports you back to Aldovia where a priceless artifact has been stolen jeopardizing a 600-year-old sacred truce between nations. Now, Amber has to unmask the thief before the clock strikes on Christmas Eve \u2014 FIRST LOOK: pic.twitter.com/d5XOABB44q \u2014 See What's Next (@seewhatsnext) October 15, 2019\n\n\u2026 there\u2019s going to be a fourth one, isn\u2019t there?\n\nNetflix also just shared a sneak peek at all of its upcoming Christmas titles, both original and not, for your viewing pleasure. Among the original titles are Let It Snow and The Knight Before Christmas. The former is based on a book co-written by John Green, and stars Kiernan Shipka of The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. The latter stars Vanessa Hudgens, and is about a time-travelling knight who falls in love with Hudgens\u2019s character \u2013 a caring science teacher who\u2019s not the biggest fan of love.\n\nYes, there\u2019s snippets from A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby in this too.\n\nStay tuned for the full trailer. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be a doozy.", "description": "A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby, the third damn movie in this very dumb movie series,\u00a0will hit the streaming giant December 5.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-10.05.29-am.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
