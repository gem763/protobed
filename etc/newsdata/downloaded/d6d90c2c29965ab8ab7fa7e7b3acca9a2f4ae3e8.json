She said that Democrats win when they \"dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started.\"\n\nKlobuchar responded that just because candidates have different ideas doesn't mean they're not fighting for regular people.\n\n\"Sometimes I think that Sen. Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other,\" he said.\n\nWarren replied, \"I'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive.\"\n\nShe added that she doesn't \"have a beef with billionaires\" but that the wealthy should pay more in taxes so that others have a chance at success.", "description": "Sen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/biden_warren_buttigieg_10152019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
