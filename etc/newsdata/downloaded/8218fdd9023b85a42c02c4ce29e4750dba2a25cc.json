This is how sick and delusional the far left has gone.\u201d\n\nThough Harris County, which includes Houston, voted Democratic in the 2016 election, thousands of supporters queued for hours last October to attend a Trump rally at the Toyota Center, the 18,300-seat home of the NBA\u2019s Houston Rockets located a short walk from the Astros\u2019 ballpark.\n\nHad Trump turned up for a game in Texas, Jones speculated, the crowd would have reacted more cordially. \u201c[It] would have been \u2018hail to the chief\u2019. We have respect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who the president is. If it were Obama and he got booed, I\u2019d say, \u2018that\u2019s a frigging disgrace\u2019. He\u2019s the president of the United States, I don\u2019t care Democratic, I don\u2019t care Republican. That\u2019s the commander in chief of our country.\u201d\n\nMike Layton, a 36-year-old Astros fan, said he was unaware of the jeering as it happened.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear any of that during the live game,\u201d Layton said. \u201cPersonally I don\u2019t care what people think of him or don\u2019t. I\u2019m here to watch a baseball game. I would like to think that he wouldn\u2019t get booed here but you never know.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump waves to the crowd during Sunday\u2019s Game 5 of the World Series at Nationals Park in Washington.

You can\u2019t really completely separate the two: politics and baseball. He\u2019s a public figure and when you\u2019re a public figure you\u2019re going to be subject to what people think. I think he\u2019s used to that, it kind of comes with the territory,\u201d she said.\n\nArtie Anderson, a 59-year-old Astros supporter, felt otherwise. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right thing to do, personally. I don\u2019t like booing players on the other team, even if they\u2019ve destroyed you in the past. That\u2019s just poor sportsmanship. Let\u2019s have an affirmative, fun atmosphere and enjoy ourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cI think it depends on where you are. The northeastern part of the United States is a little bit more abrasive than those of us in the south. We\u2019re a little bit more cordial, still.\u201d Also, Anderson said, he prefers to focus on the game than the guest VIPs: \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t want that infringing on my experience of figuring out what the count is and how Justin Verlander\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nThe answer to that last one: not well. Verlander, one of the Astros\u2019 ace starting pitchers, extended his streak of World Series futility to historic proportions as the Nationals won, 7-2, to set up a winner-takes all seventh game in Houston on Wednesday. Yet Dave Martinez, the Washington manager, was ejected for furiously arguing a dubious interference call, becoming the first skipper in 24 years to be tossed out of a World Series game. Trump may have looked surprised to be the target of ire at a ballpark, but all umpires know that for them, it is an inevitable part of the job.", "description": "The Nationals kept their title hopes alive when the World Series returned to Houston on Tuesday, but fans on both sides remained split over Trump\u2019s salty reception", "authors": ["Tom Dart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4abedaa513787cd6a56acdea6c0199a806e49e0/0_232_4409_2647/master/4409.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=733248d32f8c2e1d8c7d475444a8e142", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
