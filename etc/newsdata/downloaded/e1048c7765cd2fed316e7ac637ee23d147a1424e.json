Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Biden, currently the front-runner in the polls, has taken a centrist path, pitching proposals that build on policies formed under Mr. Obama. His closest competitors, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have staked their candidacies on making fundamental changes to American government and the economy. Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren will share the debate stage for the first time Thursday evening.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s advisers have telegraphed that he could go on the offensive\u2014calling out candidates he sees as tearing down the legacy of Mr. Obama, who enjoys wide support among Democrats.\n\nHours before the start of the debate, Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign released a minute-long video detailing his work in the Obama White House. The video, titled \u201cRecord,\u201d includes a laundry list of Obama-era accomplishments interspersed with clips of Mr. Biden heaping praise on the former president.\n\nA Biden campaign official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, said the former vice president comes into the debate with \u201ca big target on his back,\u201d expecting his rivals to attack him. The campaign said Mr. Biden would reject any notion that his ideas are incremental.\n\nBut Mr. Biden walks onto the stage after some campaign trail missteps have put him on the defensive. In recent weeks, The Washington Post reported that Mr. Biden had conflated the details of stories involving soldiers in Afghanistan. He also told National Public Radio that he opposed to the 2003 war in Iraq from the \u201cmoment it started,\u201d despite voting to authorize the invasion and making supportive public comments in the war\u2019s early months.\n\nThe three-hour televised debate, beginning at 8 p.m. EDT on ABC, takes place in Houston, the largest city in a state that will host a key Democratic primary in March. The party also hopes to put the state in play during the general election after decades of Republican dominance.\n\nA key question going into the debate is how much Ms. Warren of Massachusetts and Mr. Sanders of Vermont will challenge Mr. Biden. The two senators also are likely to face criticism from more moderate candidates who see their policies, such as Mr. Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-All proposal, as too radical for most voters to stomach.\n\nMedicare for All, which Ms. Warren has endorsed, would move every American onto a government-run health insurance plan regardless of whether they have insurance through their employer. Mr. Biden and other candidates have been critical of the plan, favoring a public-option approach in which a government-operated program would compete with private insurers.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris has taken a little from both approaches. She seeks to position herself as less tethered to ideology and more focused on addressing kitchen-table issues like tax credits for middle- and lower-income Americans and using federal dollars to raise teacher pay.\n\nMs. Harris\u2014who saw a surge in fundraising and in voter support after taking Mr. Biden to task in the first Democratic debate over his past position on busing\u2014will be looking for another strong performance after losing some momentum in the polls.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014the 37-year old who outraised all candidates through the first half of the year, but has struggled to garner wider support in the polls\u2014will likely portray himself as the face of a new generation in contrast to his elder rivals. So far, the top three Democratic candidates are all 70 or older, and Mr. Trump is 73 years old.\n\nTexas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro will also be looking to draw attention just as many voters start tuning into the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering a new phase of the campaign with the September and October debates,\u201d Mr. Castro told reporters last weekend in New Hampshire. \u201cAs people look at these 10 candidates, I believe they\u2019re going to try to figure out who can reassemble that 2008 Obama coalition, get people excited, and then take that to the next level.\u201d\n\nTen other Democrats remain in the race, but only one\u2014former hedge-fund manager Tom Steyer \u2014has met the polling and fundraising requirements to qualify for the next debate in October.\n\n\u2014Jesse Naranjo, John McCormick and Ken Thomas contributed to this article.", "description": "Joe Biden plans to defend President Obama\u2019s legacy during the third round of 2020 Democratic presidential debates, when all 10 of the top-polling candidates will share a stage for the first time.", "authors": ["Chad Day", "Chad.Day Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106739/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
