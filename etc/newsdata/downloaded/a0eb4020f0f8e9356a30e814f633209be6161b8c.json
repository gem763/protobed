That ill-fated deal kept the UK in a customs union with the EU in perpetuity, robbing us of the opportunity to strike free trade deals with third countries. It hived off Northern Ireland and it rendered the UK a rule-taker and legally bound by one-sided \u2018level playing field\u2019 obligations.\n\nThe final destination was a far cry from a sovereign, global-facing, free-trading nation that Brexit symbolises. Instead of the chance to set new rules, we would have been restricted by whole swathes of single market regulations. Whilst it was spun as Brexit, legally speaking, it was not. I voted against it 3 times.\n\n...", "description": "Just under a year ago I resigned from Government over the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.", "authors": ["Suella Braverman", "Rebecca Ryan", "Marcus Fysh", "Michael Deacon", "Juliet Samuel", "Charles Moore", "Tom Harris", "Priti Patel", "Barnabas Reynolds"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000181215680-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVfKYF8F8biotmZZgOU3KXzVjzHypXi6fM6HNRKf2oe8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
