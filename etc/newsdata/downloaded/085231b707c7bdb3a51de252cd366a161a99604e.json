I took that job on and joined my sister because she's a security guard there.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\"The way it as portrayed I need to stand up for them and the working class people because there's nothing wrong in any job.\"\n\nKatie also said she was overwhelmed by the support she received from other actors, who spoke out to say they'd also done other things in between acting jobs.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
