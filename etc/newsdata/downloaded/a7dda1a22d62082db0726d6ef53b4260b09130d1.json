He also suggested that the best way to honour murdered MP Jo Cox \u2013 a Remain campaigner killed by a right-winger shouting \u201cBritain first\u201d \u2013 was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Labour MP Jess Phillips called an urgent debate in the Commons to denounce the PM\u2019s \u201cappalling\u201d remarks and demand an apology.\n\nMs Phillips told the Commons that Mr Johnson \u2013 who sent junior minister Kevin Foster to answer questions in his place \u2013 was following a \u201ctested and work-shopped\u201d strategy to whip up hatred and division.\n\nThe Labour MP later revealed a man had been arrested at her Birmingham constituency office on Thursday afternoon after allegedly \u201csmacking the windows\u201d and shouting \u201cfascist\u201d.

What I worry about is if we don\u2019t get Brexit done, then people will feel very badly let down. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to bash on and get it done on 31 October.\u201d\n\nA senior government source also made clear that No 10 was ready to double down on its campaign to blame MPs for the failure to deliver Brexit over the past three years.\n\n\u201cTemperatures are getting particularly extreme now because we are trying to make everyone face reality,\u201d said the source.\n\n\u201cIf you have spent three years trying to avoid facing reality and then you have got to face reality, it is inevitably rather an uncomfortable process.\u201d\n\nMPs blocking a Halloween Brexit would be \u201dtaking a wrecking ball to basic democratic politics\u201d with \u201cvery, very negative consequences\u201d, warned the source.\n\nMs Phillips told the Commons that Mr Johnson\u2019s \u201cappalling\u201d comments were part of a deliberate strategy to turn voters against parliament.\n\n\u201cThe use of language yesterday and over the past few weeks such as \u2018the surrender bill\u2019, such as invoking the war, such as betrayal and treachery, it has clearly been tested, and work-shopped and worked up and entirely designed to inflame hatred and division.\n\n\u201cIt is not sincere, it is totally planned, it is completely and utterly a strategy designed by somebody to harm and cause hatred in our country.\u201d\n\nMs Johnson told Sky News she shared concerns about the consequences of her brother\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cIt is particularly tasteless for those who are grieving a mother, an MP, a friend, to say that the best way to honour her memory is to deliver the thing which she and her family campaigned against,\u201d said Ms Johnson.\n\n\u201cI think it is a very tasteless way of referring to the memory of a murdered MP \u2013 murdered by somebody who said \u2018Britain first\u2019 and was obviously of the far right tendency, which we know will have been being whipped up by this sort of language.\n\n\u201cMy brother using words like \u2018surrender\u2019 and \u2018capitulation\u2019, as if the people who are standing in the way of the blessed will of the people \u2013 as defined by 17.4 million voters in 2016 \u2013 should be hung, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered, I think that is highly reprehensible language to use.\u201d\n\nMs Johnson suggested that her brother\u2019s approach might be a result of advice from aide Dominic Cummings to \u201cbe extremely aggressive and to face down opposition from all sides of the establishment in order to secure his position as the tribune of the people\u201d.\n\nIn a highly unusual statement at the opening of business on Thursday, Commons Speaker John Bercow said that the \u201ctoxic\u201d exchanges in the Commons the previous night were \u201cworse than any I have known in my 22 years in the House\u201d.\n\nHe revealed he is considering calls from two of Westminster\u2019s most senior MPs \u2013 Father of the House Kenneth Clarke and Mother of the House Harriet Harman \u2013 for a formal inquiry into the UK\u2019s political culture, amid concerns over increasingly divisive and violent language.", "description": "Boris Johnson has again refused to apologise over inflammatory comments in the House of Commons\u00a0\u2013 as anger grows at his apparent efforts to whip up public hostility against MPs and the courts.
