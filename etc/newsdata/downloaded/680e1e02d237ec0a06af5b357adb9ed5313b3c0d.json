She told In Sight more about the tradition and what her project is about:\n\n\"The first menstruation is a turning point for every young woman in the world. In Nepal, this entry into adulthood is tied to a loss of purity. According to the Hindu faith, it is seen as a punishment for all women. In rural areas, menstrual women are exiled for a week in a practice known as Chaupadi Pratha. When they are on their period, they are not allowed to enter their houses, visit the temples or cook. Sometimes they are not even allowed to look at or talk to any male relatives.\n\n\"Dozens of women and girls have died in recent years from following this tradition, despite the practice being banned by the Supreme Court in 2005. Women are constantly at risk of being bitten by animals or choking from the fumes in the small, non-ventilated huts they are banished to. Although these restrictions have existed for decades, Nepali society is changing rapidly, with widespread access to new technologies, which are steadily becoming more and more present in the everyday lives of its inhabitants. In August 2017, for the first time in history, the country criminalized the isolation of menstrual women with a three-month jail sentence or a 3,000 rupee fine ($30), or both, for anyone who forces a woman to follow the custom.\n\n\"In Kathmandu, a new generation of young people is reinventing traditions, making them their own. Some women from rural areas have started to question Chaupadi Pratha and are becoming activists. A growing number of them lead organizations and are empowering young girls in rural areas and teaching them about hygiene. Some organizations have already liberated some rural villages from the practice.\n\n\u201cLast May, Menstrual Hygiene Day was celebrated for the first time in Kathmandu with the theme \u2018Education about menstruation changes everything.\u2019 Radha Paudel, a menstrual activist and author, says that ever since she was a child she was determined not to take part in Chaupadi Pratha. She said, \u2018I was not going to go to the hut to sleep as my mother and sisters [did.]' Paudel also believes that the solution to getting rid of this practice rests with education, especially for young women, and believes that \u2018step by step we\u2019re going to achieve what we are dreaming of.\u2019\"\n\n\n\nSurekha has perched in a tree to eat fruit.

These spaces are commonly not well ventilated, and dozens of women and girls have died in recent years from following this tradition, despite activists\u2019 campaigns and government efforts to end the practice.
