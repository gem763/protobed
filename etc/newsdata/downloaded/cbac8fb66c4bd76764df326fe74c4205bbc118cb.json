Blevins defended himself on Twitter and, on Friday afternoon, did in fact play Fortnite with a female gamer.\n\nBlevins was criticised 14 months ago after telling Polygon \u201cI don\u2019t play with female gamers.\u201d At the time he said he didn\u2019t want to put his wife \u201cthrough that,\u201d saying it could lead to claims of flirting and worse.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much he streamed with women since then, but a series of events brought the topic back this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, when Lady Gaga asked who Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins was, the obvious answer was \u201cThe biggest streamer on Earth.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the description longtime Twitch streamer Kacey \u201cKaceytron\u201d Caviness gave on Twitter:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the most popular streamers on the internet and he doesn\u2019t support women as he publicly announced he will never duo stream with any woman.\u201d\n\nBlevins replied to Caviness three hours later, saying that since the article he has \u201cplayed squads with multiple women after that article over the last year and a half as well as hosted MANY female streamers.\u201d\n\nLooking back at the 14 months since Blevins\u2019 controversial statement, it\u2019s been difficult to find many female gamers he intentionally queued up with for games. There was the 13-year-old Fortnite streamer Ewok. He also streamed with the 61-year-old talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres. It\u2019s certainly possible he has streamed with more female gamers, but not with any regularity. Some women Blevins\u2019 fans said he\u2019s played with, like Rachel \u201cAsivrs\u201d Retana, weren\u2019t actually tapped by Blevins to be on his stream; they just queued up through the game.\n\nKotaku has asked Blevins\u2019 team whether they can elaborate on his Tweet and give examples of women he has intentionally queued up for games with. They did not return the request for comment.\n\nToday, however, he sure did it. The woman on his stream is Rachel \u201cValkyrae\u201d Hofstetter, a capable and high-energy streamer for the team 100 Thieves, and the part of Blevins\u2019 chat that\u2019s making it through moderation seems to be enjoying her presence. Others ask: \u201cWhat happened to no playing with girls?\u201d\n\nCaviness has been receiving a barrage of hate for pointing out Blevins\u2019 2018 statement. Among thousands of tweets sent to her over the past 24 hours, some have called her a \u201cretard,\u201d a \u201cbitch,\u201d a \u201cthot\u201d and a \u201cfeminazi.\u201d Many of these messages defend Blevins\u2019 decision, saying he did it \u201cout of respect for his wife.\u201d (Caviness, whom Kotaku has profiled, has remained relevant on Twitch since 2013 for her satire and provocative sense of humour.)\n\n\u201cAt the time [of the Polygon article] he was the most popular Fortnite streamer, played with all of the other popular guy streamers... essentially making it a club that female Fortnite players were left out of,\u201d said Caviness on Twitter. \u201cBeing a female in gaming, it upset me. Do I want to play with Ninja? Fuck no, appeasing sponsors and babysitting kids isn\u2019t really my forte.\u201d", "description": "On Wednesday, controversy surrounding Fortnite golden boy Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins resurfaced after a high-profile callout of his apparent avoidance of streaming with female gamers.
