And Amazon has resisted revealing the impact on the climate its business has had, previously declining, for example, to divulge its carbon footprint to CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, a framework for corporate reporting on environmental issues.\n\nThe president of CDP North America, Bruno Sarda, called the new Climate Pledge that Amazon agreed to \u201cunnecessary,\u201d given that carbon-reporting standards already exist. Amazon is the only large retailer that hasn\u2019t reported through CDP, and Sarda said the new pledge lacks standardized rules for what\u2019s disclosed and metrics for what\u2019s measured.\n\n\u201cIt fails the test of accountability and transparency,\u201d Sarda said.\n\nAmazon is following standard reporting protocols for greenhouse gases and working with other environmental organizations on its methodology and disclosures, said spokesman Dan Perlet.\n\nBezos\u2019s appearance comes just a day before more than 1,000 Amazon employees plan to walk off the job to protest the company\u2019s track record on environmental responsibility. The walkout is part of the larger global climate strike that includes more than 800 events in the United States alone.\n\nAmazon, of course, has a massive environmental footprint, delivering what some experts estimate is more than 1 billion packages a year to consumers in the United States. The company\u2019s Amazon Web Services is also the leading provider of cloud-computing to corporate customers, consuming massive amounts of electricity to power its giant data centers, including one in Northern Virginia.\n\nAnd Amazon initiatives to speed delivery, jetting products quickly to warehouses and deploying a fleet of delivery vehicles to customers\u2019 homes, also are likely to expand its environmental footprint.\n\nThat race to get packages to consumers is a competitive advantage Amazon wields over rivals, who can\u2019t match the e-commerce giant\u2019s sophisticated logistics infrastructure. But that advantage exists in conflict with any effort to reduce its carbon emissions, said Josu\u00e9 Vel\u00e1zquez Mart\u00ednez, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Center for Transportation and Logistics and director of its Sustainable Logistics Initiative.\n\n\u201cThat part is not sustainable at all,\u201d Vel\u00e1zquez Mart\u00ednez said of Amazon\u2019s push toward one-day and same-day deliveries. He believes Amazon should show consumers the environmental impact of speedy shipping as a way to provide an incentive to choose slower delivery.\n\n\u201cThey could do much more in terms of sustainability,\u201d Vel\u00e1zquez Mart\u00ednez said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Bezos said that increasing the speed of delivery can be one path to reducing carbon emissions. Same-day or one-day delivery eases reliance on air transportation, Bezos said. Having warehouses located close to customers means that products travel shorter distances, which can bring less carbon-intensive delivery times.\n\nAmazon has taken steps to make its packaging and shipping more efficient, although that can also be attributed to reducing costs.\n\nIn February, Amazon committed to making half its shipments carbon neutral by 2030. In a blog post at the time, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of operations Dave Clark wrote the company would also disclose the company\u2019s carbon footprint by the end of the year.\n\nA group of workers who have formed under the name Amazon Employees for Climate Justice are pushing the company to set more aggressive targets. In a post earlier this month on the website Medium, the group calls on Amazon to commit to being carbon neutral by 2030, to end Amazon Web Services contracts that help energy companies accelerate oil and gas extraction, and to stop funding politicians and lobbyists who deny climate change.\n\n\u201cAs employees at one of the largest and most powerful companies in the world, our role in facing the climate crisis is to ensure our company is leading on climate, not following,\u201d the group wrote in its Medium post.\n\nBezos said Thursday that he didn\u2019t agree with the idea that the company should stop giving energy companies tools to do their jobs. He added that Amazon will \u201clook very carefully\u201d at whether it\u2019s funding climate change deniers.\n\nThe employee group tweeted Thursday the Amazon\u2019s new initiative is a \u201chuge win\u201d for it efforts. But it still wants more.\n\n\u201cThe Paris Agreement, by itself, won\u2019t get us to a livable world,\u201d the group tweeted. \u201cToday, we celebrate. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll be in the streets.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s Climate Pledge is a huge win for @AMZNforClimate & we\u2019re thrilled at what workers have achieved in under a year. But we know it\u2019s not enough. The Paris Agreement, by itself, won\u2019t get us to a livable world. Today, we celebrate. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll be in the streets. \u2014 Amazon Employees For Climate Justice (@AMZNforClimate) September 19, 2019\n\nThe environmental group Greenpeace has also been critical of Amazon\u2019s commitment to renewable energy. In a report last February, the group said the company is wavering on a pledge to move to 100 percent renewable energy to run its data centers.\n\nBezos said on Thursday that Amazon would aim to reach 80 percent renewable energy by 2024 and 100 percent renewable energy by 2030 on its path to net zero carbon by 2040. So far, Amazon has launched 15 utility-scale wind and solar renewable energy projects and installed more than 50 solar rooftops on fulfillment centers and sorting centers worldwide.\n\nThe company is also ordering 100,000 fully electric delivery vehicles from Plymouth, Mich.,-based Rivian, a company in which Amazon invested $440 million. Amazon expects to start delivering with those vans in 2021, and Bezos said will be fully deployed by 2024.\n\nThursday\u2019s announcement also included news of a $100 million donation toward reforestation efforts. In partnership with the Nature Conservancy, the Right Now Climate Fund will focus on protecting forests, wetlands and peatlands to remove millions of metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nAmazon will also launch a new sustainability website to report on its commitments and performance. Information will include Amazon\u2019s carbon footprint and other sustainability metrics tied to the goals of the Climate Pledge.\n\nBezos said he did not yet know what the full costs of Amazon\u2019s new sustainability efforts will be but that Amazon would also be lobbying for climate-focused policies on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis. He stopped short of fully embracing the policies of the Green New Deal, for example.\n\nAs Amazon works toward the launch of a second headquarters in Northern Virginia, Bezos said the company had \u201can opportunity to do that right,\u201d including focusing on air conditioning and heating solutions that would fall in line with the company\u2019s new climate goals.\n\nAsked about the global climate protests expected on Friday, Bezos said people \u201cshould be passionate about this issue,\u201d even if he doesn\u2019t agree with all of the proposals put forth by his employees or others. He called on other companies of Amazon\u2019s scale and influence to jump on board.\n\n\u201cThere will be people who will be slow to take up this challenge,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cBut I hope the major players will take it up quickly. The need for speed is very great here.\u201d", "description": "The announcement comes as the online retail giant faces criticism for its huge carbon footprint and a lack of transparency into its energy use.", "authors": ["Rachel Siegel", "National Business Reporter", "Jay Greene", "Reporter Focused On Technology Coverage In The Pacific Northwest"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JK2QT2ER3QI6TFLKRDBJDK24HA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
