But uncertainty over Brexit has pushed EU regulators to advise financial firms to use the law of one of the remaining EU states for new contracts.\n\nThe ESM's decision will be operational from Oct. 1, before the Oct 31 deadline for Britain to leave the EU. It said its bonds denominated in dollars will remain under English law.", "description": "Euro zone rescue fund to stop issuing bonds in euros under English law", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/Brazil-Stock-Market_3_800x533_L_1414427437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
