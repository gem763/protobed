You\u2019ve got this line here: \u201cWe might not be able to stop the rise of the machines, but we can at least create a more consensual system, a fair day\u2019s wage for a fair day\u2019s data.\u201d How would that work?\n\nAmber Baldet: Well, to be honest, that was kind of a tongue-in-cheek jab at a fair day\u2019s work for a fair day\u2019s pay because I don\u2019t know about you, but it hasn\u2019t worked out for a lot of the global populace.\n\nThat\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m asking. But the example you just gave \u2014 \u201cI want you to have a photo that I took. So I sent you a photo. Now we have two copies of the photo.\u201d \u2014 sort of reduces the value of my single photo in a way that if I had a print before. How do you stop things from being copied infinitely and a system that is designed around that specific mechanical task?\n\nThat\u2019s a slightly different problem. Having something that is like a dollar. A dollar is fungible. A dollar in my pocket is as good as a dollar in your pocket. But when I have $100 in my pocket in singles, I can give a portion of them to you, and then I simply don\u2019t have them anymore. The challenge with file distribution is something called digital rights management. People have been trying to watermark photos and somehow stop the spread of them for 15, 20 years. I used to work at a company that made very proprietary research. How do you stop people from just forwarding on the newsletter? And all of the solutions are relatively hacky or not elegant and pretty easily undermined. At the end of the day, your ephemeral photo app might tell you that it prevents screenshots, but it doesn\u2019t stop you from holding up another phone and taking a picture of that picture.\n\nSo there\u2019s a difference between data privacy (which is the data that you have and that you want to keep yours and prevent from leaving your purview) and the concept of confidentiality (that you\u2019ve shared something consensually with someone, whether that\u2019s a point-to-point text message or with a vendor where you signed a toss that I\u2019m sure you read 100 percent of the terms of service for) that once they have it, in a way it\u2019s theirs. There\u2019s not a way to pull that back. There is privacy research happening now though for ways that we can coordinate and collaborate on things without disclosing that data, where you can say, \u201cEither bring an application or an algorithm to data that stays with you, and we can train models collectively, and we can come to agreement about things without disclosing things.\u201d It\u2019s very exciting.\n\nBut it also has become this kind of silver bullet now of a technical solution trying to solve a social problem that we have, which is that we don\u2019t trust each other. But also all of the legal agreements that have been created have this power asymmetry where it just... there\u2019s nothing I can do once my data is gone. It\u2019s gone.\n\nSo I think that there are a lot of different tools in the toolkit when you\u2019re designing systems that provide people more agency. But right now, they are so either in the R&D stage or incredibly complex to interact with, or you need a PhD to be able to install and run these things that, for most people, you\u2019re going to sign up with medium. I mean, that\u2019s what you do.\n\nSo my position in terms of service agreement should be legal. You certainly can\u2019t say no and then still use your iPhone. You\u2019re just kind of screwed. That, to me, is a very powerful idea that you would somehow claw some power back to the individual, and they\u2019d be able to express some market signal. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give you this much data.\u201d But it seems very hard to get from what we\u2019re talking about, which sounds great to your point, which is the application sources are still very complicated, still very far away from the consumer.\n\nYeah, and to your question about what is a fair day\u2019s wage for a fair day\u2019s data, half of the global population is coming online over the next 10 years, and not everybody\u2019s data is worth the same thing. And we do run quite a risk of looking at populations that are even less educated about what their data means and how it\u2019s deployed than the people that have been on the internet for some time. Applications come to them and say, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to pay you for this. You\u2019re not involved necessarily in understanding the market rate of this, but we\u2019re going to pay you for something.\u201d What is it of value that they have that they\u2019re necessarily going to sell in that situation? It\u2019s very likely that privacy becomes something that the rich can afford and that the rest of us simply cannot because you need either the compensation or you are offered access to a network that you couldn\u2019t afford otherwise, as long as you give away your data.\n\nSo would it be better than the system that we have now or when you have no say, maybe, but it might simply be papering over the underlying and growing kind of technical inequities that are happening.\n\nSo we\u2019ve been talking about a lot of things blockchain might be able to do or different systems it might be able to be the foundation of. But right now, when most people think of cryptocurrency, they think specifically about the financial aspect of it. Why is that? Why hasn\u2019t it broken? What is the app that makes people think about blockchain in a way that\u2019s relevant to them besides, \u201cI\u2019m going to hold bitcoin.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t really think people need to hope that blockchain is relevant to them any more than at some point someone said, \u201cHey, how\u2019s the relational database good for me?\u201d That\u2019s just not a question that we ask. It was all of the applications that were built on top of this new type of architecture that allowed kind of the web 2.0 emergence to happen, that suddenly, there was something you wanted to do. And it wasn\u2019t because you were able to store and join sequel databases in brand-new ways.\n\nIt\u2019s the social graph there, and now we\u2019re going to do different types of operations on that. So I think money is a fantastic application. And people have been working quite hard on making, whether it\u2019s Bitcoin or some other coin making that is usable. I think what would be great for people to understand is not \u201cHow does the blockchain help me?\u201d but rather that right now, we\u2019re seeing a huge push toward cashless in society, in general. Scandinavian countries right now are almost entirely cashless. They trust their government. They have a very different opinion than somewhere like India that\u2019s attempting to demonetize and go cashless forcibly where they have a very large cash economy in existence.\n\nSo it really is a radical idea to have people not have cash in their pockets. Thirty years ago, I remember my mom telling me when I was a kid, \u201cIt\u2019s illegal not to accept cash.\u201d Only some places will accept credit cards. That\u2019s optional. But cash... cash is money. Now, you can definitely go to a bistro, and they will say \u201cWe\u2019re cashless\u201d or your farmers market where you buy asparagus for five bucks, they\u2019d rather you use Square. And what does that mean? It means that every financial transaction, every time you buy something, you are actually asking a third-party service, \u201cIs it okay that I do this?\u201d And you don\u2019t really have insight into how many different providers are part of that yes or no decision that happens so quickly. And a lot of people say, \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m buying asparagus. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d But you know, what if you were buying an engagement ring. Would you want that broadcast to your Facebook feed? Probably not.\n\nWhat if you were paying a health insurance bill or medical bill that you want to make sure your employer doesn\u2019t necessarily see... We have these separations of concerns. And there are plenty of legitimate reasons that people expect financial privacy. Perhaps you want to donate to one political cause versus another. We can\u2019t really look at \u201cIf you\u2019re not doing anything wrong, then you don\u2019t need privacy.\u201d It really is privacy from whom in what context. And that context is changing all the time.\n\nSo what might be fine for you today might not necessarily be fine for you tomorrow, and might definitely not be fine for a vulnerable population that struggles to be financially included day-to-day anyway.\n\nSo that conversation is very much sort of like the bitcoin argument, right?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be bitcoin, though. And I\u2019m not saying anything good or bad about bitcoin. I\u2019m not a bitcoin maximalist, but I\u2019m also not anti-bitcoin. I\u2019m just a person who knows things.\n\nThat\u2019s why I want to get into it.\n\nBut there\u2019s certainly something to be said for a version of digital cash where, right now, we go to an ATM, you take out money that you have, you can do something with that cash, and then if you don\u2019t use all the cash, you can deposit it back into the ATM. What happened with that cash in the interim? Banks have collectively decided as long as you\u2019re not depositing more than X amount in X days according to X client customer profile, you\u2019re fine. We\u2019ll take your dollars back.\n\nIn an entirely cashless ecosystem, every transaction \u2014 no matter how small \u2014 would be on that grid. There\u2019s not an escape hatch where you can take something out, and a publicly accessible cryptocurrency does provide that. It could be more seamlessly integrated into the banking system where you have certain digital wallets that you open at a bank just like a debit card. There\u2019s no reason that those kinds of hybrid solutions can\u2019t be explored other than current land grabs around market share, and conversations with regulators about what is or is not acceptable.\n\nSo you\u2019re on the board of the Zcash Foundation. It sits around bitcoin in a way that cryptocurrency is going to sit around.\n\nZcash was originally a fork of the bitcoin project with additional cryptographic privacy added to it, yes.\n\nIn that role, how do you think about the ecosystem and what Zcash is trying to do?\n\nThey really are keeping on this idea of a technically pure privacy solution to digital cash as their north star. There\u2019s certainly people who can flame each other on Twitter about whether or not that goal is being achieved. Most of the transactions in the Zcash network are just as public as bitcoin ones. For people who don\u2019t participate or play with bitcoin, they might not realize that it\u2019s actually not as private as maybe the news has made it out to be. It\u2019s pseudonymous. So as long as you keep some information private, then it\u2019s hard to trace back to you. But actually a public ledger, a public blockchain is completely visible to anyone.\n\nYou could, for example, a couple of years ago when the NHS was hacked and there was this ransomware attack where all of their files were encrypted, and they say \u201cPay us bitcoin, and we\u2019ll unlock it,\u201d with the address to deposit that bitcoin. It\u2019s in the malware. You could look at it. You could go to your favorite blockchain explorer, put in the address, and watch funds flowing into that wallet. And then you can trace those funds after that. There\u2019s ways to kind of split and obfuscate that trail over time, but really, those are tainted funds forever, in some ways. And so, the Zcash project is working on making sure that the privacy isn\u2019t simply at that networking layer and at the \u201cwe can all have unbounded number of keys\u201d layer. Sorry, I don\u2019t want to get too technical here, but they actually generate what are called zero knowledge proofs as you go. And like I mentioned before, that\u2019s a way for two people who don\u2019t trust each other to prove something without actually exposing what the inputs to the question.\n\nA simple example of where that might be used in regular life would be... let\u2019s say that you had five people in a room, and they all wanted to figure out if they were being paid the same for the same job. How would you solve that right now? You\u2019d probably find a person and everybody would tell them, \u201cWhat\u2019s your salary?\u201d and that person would say, \u201cOkay, it was you,\u201d but without disclosing what all the numbers were.\n\nSo you can construct zero knowledge proofs to do that essentially in a black box way. So that you can solve that problem without having to have that intermediary. Again, it\u2019s about removing kind of intermediary... Let me back up for a second. It\u2019s about being able to remove unnecessary kind of central actors and achieve something technically that we couldn\u2019t do before.\n\nSo I want to bring that all the way back around to like the first thing you said, which is the first group of people \u2014 the cypherpunks, the people who brought about the technology \u2014 they had not only a technical problem they were trying to solve, but a massive social problem. There was a philosophy behind it. And what you\u2019re describing is, we should be able to put as much salary information to a black box and get it out without figuring out who disclosed what to whom. That\u2019s never before been possible. And now it\u2019s mathematically possible. Do you spend a lot of time thinking about, well, should math enable us to do things that human beings themselves could not do in that way?\n\nWell, fundamentally, early on, the challenge or one of the things that was so amazing about the early cypherpunk work is the advocacy for strong encryption and the work there. And we all use strong encryption every day. We probably don\u2019t know it. But every time you visit a website that\u2019s using SSL or TLS now, you get the little lock in your URL bar. This part of the PKI, the public kind of key system that the internet is really built around. And we take this for granted that there\u2019s an ability for us to transact securely end-to-end on the internet. And it simply didn\u2019t need to be that way. In fact, those initial algorithms that allow you to do this, and what\u2019s in layman\u2019s terms, what\u2019s interesting about strong encryption is that you can publish the entire algorithm without it becoming weaker for having done so.\n\nThere\u2019s no golden key or secret bit of information that has to be kept in a vault that someone controls in order to have the algorithm be secure. And this is actually really important. It becomes important, for example, when, after the San Bernardino shooting, when iPhone was used, and the FBI went to Apple and said, \u201cCan you open this phone for us?\u201d And they simply said, \u201cNo, we just simply cannot do that. There\u2019s no backdoor to this encryption. We can\u2019t do that for you.\u201d And so you\u2019ll see it again arise in Congress, the question, should we have strong encryption? Should it exist? Well, it does exist. And if we collectively, as a society, decide that we want to only use backdoored encryption, then other people will simply use the strong encryption.\n\nAnd now, we are using something that\u2019s intentionally hamstringed, and it becomes a security threat, a national security threat, essentially, to our financial systems, our internet, our daily banking, everything else we do. And so that advocacy early on was very important. But where we\u2019re at now has gone much farther than that to say, our daily privacy of our goings-about simply cannot be separated from our digital lives. There\u2019s no such thing as IRL anymore. IRL is digital. We are all online, all of the time.\n\nIf The Verge has a thesis statement, it\u2019s that.\n\nYeah, the internet is IRL, is life. I\u2019m from the internet. And so as privacy becomes something that you simply cannot divorce from your digital privacy, we need to have tools that allow us to maintain our agency and our simple human dignity.\n\nSo that brings me back to something you mentioned earlier, which is, right now, it\u2019s very complicated. Installing many of these apps and services is very difficult. It\u2019s hard to even quite understand which ones you should participate in, apart from bitcoin and potentially Ethereum, and none of them have really reached that network effect scaling moment where they\u2019re valuable to everyone, not just sort of early adopters. What is the inflection point, do you think? And I realized that you said it\u2019s not important to you, like it\u2019s a sequel database. But at some point, sequel databases took over the world, and now I can point to them everywhere. I can\u2019t quite do that with blockchains yet.\n\nThe main project that I\u2019m working on at Clovyr is about infrastructure orchestration and coordination. And eventually, user discovery of apps that are out there in a decentralized non-curated by Apple in the Apple Store kind of way. But early on, that looks a lot like also great developer tools and developer enablement. So we kind of have to walk before we run there. But I think that for every app in the retail space or the regular user space where we sign up for some service because it says they\u2019re going to give you your astrology chart or they\u2019re going to let you blog or they\u2019re going to tell you where the restaurants are in your neighborhood, there is probably a very motivated group of college kids trying to get a Y Combinator grant to solve that problem in a decentralized way.\n\nIt was very frustrating over the last couple of years to have that suddenly mean ICO and token, rather than thinking about \u201cWhat would this just mean as a self-hosted application, something that I could run?\u201d For folks that don\u2019t necessarily code or deal with infrastructure themselves, that probably is a meaningless phrase to them. But to go back to the, like, \u201clet\u2019s stick a floppy in a computer\u201d model, one of the reasons that we all wanted to move that to the cloud was that you wanted to access your document from a number of different machines, maybe your phone, maybe your work computer, maybe your home computer. And so you need what\u2019s called a server to sit in the middle and serve out that data.\n\nAnd it\u2019s much, much more efficient to aggregate all of those servers into one place, to virtualize them, slice them, dice them. Now we\u2019re moving into a server list model where you don\u2019t even know where the heck... It\u2019s getting crazy out there. It\u2019s a challenge for new developers that come into this space, you don\u2019t need to understand kind of the technical stack the way it used to be because you never see these things isolated. It\u2019s just a connection of services that you glue together into some sort of application. But for regular people, what you wanted to do is run the app, I wanted to run QuickBooks or whatever.\n\nSo there should be a way to decouple the infrastructure and the piece of \u201cWhere does this thing sit and how does it run, and how do I access this from what you wanted to do?\u201d The app usage and the content creation and the data that it\u2019s storing? And this goes into what people would call deweb or decentralized web kind of projects. There\u2019s an entire bunch of folks that are looking at how can we create new types of self-hosted applications where you simply don\u2019t have those other intermediaries, but they can connect to each other, swap data, share information, just like you have a central coordinator. In order to do that, you need to be able to make running that infrastructure as seamless as if somebody else was doing it, and that\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m working on.", "description": "Amber Baldet discusses where cryptocurrencies on the blockchain are going, the potential of Facebook\u2019s Libra project, and how the blockchain can revive our trust in putting our data online.", "authors": ["Andrew Marino", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rUaR5RqYmvfihRfA_BzIMNOzcio=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10576389/acastro_180402_2428_001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
