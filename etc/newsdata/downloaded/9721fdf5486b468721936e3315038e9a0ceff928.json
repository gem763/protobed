We're about to find out.\n\nThis week, Porsche announced its most futuristic design of all time. No, we\u2019re not talking about a new version of its Taycan EV. This is a vehicle so far, far away from everything they\u2019ve designed before that it won\u2019t be measured in something as earthly as miles per hour \u2014 it\u2019ll be measured in megalight per hour.\n\nThat\u2019s right, the German marque is working on a new vehicle for Star Wars. \u201cDesigners at Porsche AG and Lucasfilm Ltd. are collaborating on a fantasy starship design that will be presented at the world premiere of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,\u201d according to a press release.\n\nThat premiere is currently set for December 20th, and while that\u2019s only two months away Porsche and Lucasfilm haven\u2019t released any specifics about the design. Will there be sublight thrusters? Laser cannons? Planet-exploding superlasers?! We\u2019ll have to wait and see, as the companies have only released a few brainstorming photos, including one where Doug Chiang, vice president and executive creative director of Lucasfilm, and Michael Mauer, vice president of style at Porsche, are seemingly poring over classic Star Wars vehicle designs.\n\nDoug Chiang of Lucasfilm and Michael Mauer of Porsche working on the vehicle design. (Porsche AG)\n\n\u201cThe worldwide appeal of the Star Wars and Porsche brands is shaped decisively by their iconic designs,\u201d said Doug Chiang, the man responsible for overseeing all designs for the Star Wars franchise. \u201cWe are bringing together two worlds with this project: the exotic film design of a galaxy far, far away and the precision work that goes into developing emotive Porsche sports cars. This collaboration promises to produce an innovative design that will blend the best of both brands to create an exciting new starship worthy of Porsche and Star Wars.\u201d\n\nThe bad news (if there can be such a thing with a collab this perfect)? The vehicle won\u2019t actually be appearing in The Rise of Skywalker, and there\u2019s no tell of what the final form will be \u2014 whether it will be simply a digital representation or a full-size physical model.\n\nSo it\u2019s not going to be in the movie and Porsche won\u2019t be selling it, so why are they doing it? \u201cIn addition to the model\u2019s public unveiling \u2026 Porsche will also be showcasing their first all-electric car \u2013 the Taycan \u2013 at the event.\u201d Ah, of course \u2014 our old friend product placement.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.", "description": "Porsche and Lucasfilm are teaming up to design a new starship for the Star Wars franchise.
