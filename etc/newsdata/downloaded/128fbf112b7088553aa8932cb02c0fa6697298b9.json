Congratulations on an amazing career my friend. Racing in the same era as you has been an honor. 8 overall titles is a record no one will ever break! Enjoy the time with your family pic.twitter.com/JDHMctCaOG\n\nHe won 67 World Cup races in all to sit third on the all-time list behind Lindsey Vonn (82) and Ingemar Stenmark (86). American star Mikaela Shiffrin is closing in on Hirscher's tally, with 60 wins ahead of the new season, which starts in Solden, Austria in October.\n\nBut it's Hirscher's domination of the overall season standings -- for points accrued in all disciplines -- that marks him out; his nearest rival Annemarie Moser-Proell of Austria won six overall titles, while Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg won it fives times on the men's circuit between 1985 and 1993.\n\nHirscher also won seven world titles in various disciplines and clinched two gold medals in the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea in 2018 to add to a silver from Sochi four years earlier.\n\n\"I would place him in same range as Stenmark. At least,\" Peter Schrocksnadel, veteran head of the Austrian Ski Federation, told CNN Sport in Kitzbuhel in January.\n\nAnother Austrian great Franz Klammer, the 1976 Olympic downhill champion, told CNN in Kitzbuhel: \"You cannot compare different times, different situations but Hirscher is definitely one of the best ever.\"\n\nMarcel Hirscher (left) and Mikaela Shiffrin won the men's and women's World Cup overall titles for 2019.\n\nAt the season-ending World Cup finals in Soldeu, Andorra in March, Hirscher told CNN's Alpine Edge he had accomplished \"way, way more\" than he ever dreamed possible.\n\nBut he admitted his priorities had changed after he and wife Laura had their first child -- a boy -- last year.\n\n\"Ski racing is not the most important thing any more,\" Hirscher told CNN's Christina Macfarlane.\n\nPhotos: Stunning images from ski racing Winter wonderland \u2013 Snow covers the mountains and the 2018-2019 ski racing season is under way.

He admitted to CNN in Soldeu he was struggling with the decision because he felt \"brilliant\" and said he and his team were \"getting better and better.\"\n\nBut he says he made up his mind two weeks ago, and told the news conference: \"I'm incredibly lucky to be able to sit here with two healthy knees.\n\nNow it's official \ud83d\ude22! @MarcelHirscher retires from competition! Thank you for everything you have given to the sport and congratulations on an immense career. #fisalpine #legend pic.twitter.com/fuBGMnL6ok \u2014 FIS Alpine (@fisalpine) September 4, 2019\n\n\"I want to play soccer with my kids, to ride motocross, and I'm glad I can do it now, and I'm fortunate to be healthy and survive my career without major injury.\n\n\"It will certainly be a big change, but some projects are waiting for me. It will not be easy but the beauty is that I can now choose the days to go skiing.\"\n\nGrowing up in the small town of Annaberg in eastern Austria, Hirscher didn't see foresee a fast track to greatness. When he joined the World Cup tour at 18, a single victory would have represented career success.\n\n\"Where I grew up nobody had done that before,\" he said. \"It would be something you can be proud of and maybe one medal at a world championship. Wow.\n\n\"I dreamed never too big. I hate to dream really big and at the end of your career have just reached one percent of big dreams. That's not fun. Better to have small dreams and live it big.\"", "description": "He's arguably the greatest ski racer ever and one of the most dominant athletes of his generation, but Austrian Marcel Hirscher has announced his retirement from the sport.", "authors": ["Rob Hodgetts"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190319104753-marcel-hirscher-skiing-world-cup-retirement-super-tease.jpg"}
