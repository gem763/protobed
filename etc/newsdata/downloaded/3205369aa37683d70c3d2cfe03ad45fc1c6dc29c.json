The president said that he assumes he'll be impeached, which would lead to a trial in the Senate \u2014 one that Trump also assumes he'll win with the support he enjoys there from majority Republicans.\n\nThe outsider\n\nNational security and diplomatic specialists are said to have told Congress that they resented the involvement of an outsider, in Giuliani, and a few of them are understood to have opposed Trump's pressure strategy on its merits.\n\nFor one, it flouted the will of Congress, which had been authorizing and appropriating the military support to Ukraine for years. And for another reason, it sowed doubts about American resolve in Eastern Europe, to the detriment of Ukraine and the benefit of Russia, some argued.\n\nThat's what Taylor, Tuesday's witness, said to his counterparts.\n\n\"The message to the Ukrainians (and Russians) we send with the decision on security assistance is key,\" Taylor wrote in another text message in September. \"With the hold\" \u2014 the interruption in delivery of funding that Kyiv was expecting \u2014 \"we have already shaken their faith in us. Thus my nightmare scenario.\"\n\nThe Democrats' depositions have taken place behind closed doors and so the picture that has emerged about their discoveries is incomplete. Reporters have had to rely in part on accounts given by others about what is being said in testimony or on only opening statements that have been made public.\n\nAdditions and deletions\n\nThe committees' witness on Wednesday is Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper. She is a career Defense Department official who's responsible for policy toward Russia and Eastern Europe \u2014 including Ukraine.\n\nMembers and committee staff likely want to ask her for the Defense Department's perspective on the events of the past few months, given the key role the military has played in supplying weapons and other assistance to Ukrainian forces fighting Russian and Russian-backed groups in the east.\n\nTrump and the White House have said one reason that military assistance to Ukraine was frozen was the U.S. wanted more assurances about Kyiv's commitment to fighting corruption.\n\nThe White House blocked that aid in the summer, even though, as NPR has revealed, the Defense Department had certified in May that Ukraine's corruption-fighting progress was sufficient to clear the way for about $250 million in assistance.\n\nCooper likely will be questioned about how much she or others in the Pentagon knew about the full picture of what was involved with the freeze that followed the green light from the Defense Department.\n\nThe road goes ever on\n\nLawmakers canceled the depositions they had planned for Thursday and Friday because the House instead is planning memorial events for the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who chaired the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.\n\nTwo other prospective witnesses this week have said they won't show.\n\nThe acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, scoffed at Democrats' inquiry on Twitter on Monday and vowed that neither he nor OMB's associate director of national security programs, Michael Duffey, would appear as requested.\n\nThe White House has declared Democrats' impeachment inquiry invalid because, among other reasons, the full House hasn't been able to cast a vote on whether to convene one.\n\nThat and other objections prompted White House counsel Pat Cipollone to notify House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the administration wouldn't play ball.\n\nTrump's supporters in Congress \u2014 including Republican Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia \u2014 also observe that for as much as Pelosi has sought to make the Ukraine affair the focus of the current impeachment efforts, Democrats' first impeachment proposals were filed, for various causes, years ago.\n\nFor many of the best-known prospective witnesses in the administration, including Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others, Cipollone's bulwark has held.\n\nBut the stream of agency-level experts and others has nonetheless continued, in part because witnesses have so far been unwilling to fight congressional subpoenas.\n\nPelosi, meanwhile, cites what she calls the broad discretion she has under the Constitution to pursue impeachment. The House doesn't need to vote, she argues \u2014 but she also hasn't ruled out a vote at some point.", "description": "Ambassador William Taylor talked with compatriots in real time about his objections to President Trump's policy.
