(Photo: Michael Kovac/Getty Images) More\n\nIn fact, the Almost Famous helmsman had originally wanted Orlando Bloom for the role, but found him unavailable, as the English actor was making the Crusades flop Kingdom of Heaven with Ridley Scott at the time.\n\nSpeaking to Sean Evans on the Hot Ones web series, he recalled (via E!), \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll say fired, sure. [Crowe] originally wanted Orlando Bloom for Elizabethtown and Orlando Bloom was working on a Ridley Scott picture, and wasn\u2019t available.\n\n\u201cSo I went [to] audition, he cast me and then we started working on it.

But also, I found out at the same time that Orlando Bloom had just become available right when he was gonna let me go.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, Kutcher was probably better off missing out. Elizabethtown, which also starred Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon and Jessica Biel, was largely panned by critics and grossed only $52 million at the box office.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
