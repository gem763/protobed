She cited three factors: demographics, education and productivity.\n\nYellen noted that at 0.5 percent, labor-force growth is sluggish, thanks in large part to a slowdown in population growth, a decrease in immigration and an aging society. In the 1980s, Yellen pointed out, an \u201cinflux of women\u201d entering the workforce helped boost labor-force growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen speaks during a news conference after a two-day Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) policy meeting, in Washington, U.S., September 20, 2017.

You need to grow the workforce,\u201d Kaplan said.\n\nIn the second quarter, the U.S. economy expanded by 2 percent, boosted by strong consumer spending despite softer business investment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Yellen, who served as chair from 2014 to 2018, said the Fed may have overestimated the economy\u2019s strength with its latest forecast.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/c109bcfa-2017-01-18T215445Z_2_LYNXMPED0H1MN_3_USA-FED.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
