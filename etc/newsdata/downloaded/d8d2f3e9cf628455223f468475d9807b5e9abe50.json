Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 The traffic is snarled, the air muggy, the police impatient, the locals weary. It\u2019s September in the Big Apple and the U.N. General Assembly is in session.\n\nNinety-one heads of state and 45 heads of government are among the dozens of delegations convening in midtown Manhattan. There are some notable absences: Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 on the cusp of losing power \u2014 are all skipping the week\u2019s meetings.\n\nPresident Trump will speak on Tuesday morning from the dais of the General Assembly for the third time of his tenure. He will probably reiterate his skepticism about an international system anchored by the United Nations and its agencies, long the bete noire of U.S. conservatives.\n\n\u201cI do think it is fair to say that this administration is applying new levels of scrutiny to the U.N. and other bodies to assess their effectiveness against the billions of dollars provided by the American taxpayer,\u201d Kelly Craft, Trump\u2019s recently installed envoy to the United Nations, told my colleague Carol Morello. She spoke of \u201clooking ahead to remind the other nations of the U.N. that the United States isn\u2019t going anywhere\u201d and that U.S. diplomats will \u201cpress for real action\u201d to advance human rights, women\u2019s empowerment and other global causes.\n\nThis time for Trump, his sojourn at the United Nations could be a welcome reprieve from the uproar in Washington over his apparent attempt to enlist a foreign government (in this instance, that of Ukraine) in his bid to win reelection at home. On Monday, Trump grumbled at the \u201ccrooked as hell\u201d news media in appearances alongside the leaders of Poland and Pakistan. But Trump\u2019s theatrics are hardly the only ones to watch this week. Here\u2019s a rundown of the main story lines to follow.\n\nA world without Trump: Before the high-level speeches began on Tuesday, the president declined the chance to participate or speak in two major Monday sessions on the climate and universal health care. Given Trump\u2019s positions \u2014 he sees both global climate activism and domestic moves to reform health care as leftist plots that would harm the American economy \u2014 the decision to skip was almost certainly for ideological reasons.\n\nBut the rest of the world, least of all U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, is no longer in the mood to oblige him. \u201cIn 2017 and 2018, world leaders seemed nervous about offending Trump or even launching initiatives he might dislike,\u201d Richard Gowan, U.N. director at the International Crisis Group, told Today\u2019s WorldView. \u201cThis year is different. Guterres and a large group of states decided to make a big push on climate change despite U.S. disengagement on the issue. The world has decided that it has to try to make multilateralism work without the U.S. if it must.\u201d\n\nGuterres has spent months building up attention to the climate deliberations this week, warning the world that it faced an \u201capocalyptic\u201d future. \u201cThe climate emergency is a race we are losing but it is a race we can win,\u201d he said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel arrived at the United Nations having already announced a huge multibillion-euro plan to curb emissions (though critics in Germany argued that it didn\u2019t go far enough). French President Emmanuel Macron was among the more than 50 world leaders who delivered climate-focused speeches, urging his counterparts to weigh all matters of trade and finance with climate in mind. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled a $1.5 billion fund to protect endangered species and help promote innovative technologies to tackle climate change.\n\nWatch: \"If you choose to fail us, we will never forgive you,\" Greta Thunberg tells world leaders at the UN climate summit. pic.twitter.com/xp8E1oynM5 \u2014 The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) September 23, 2019\n\nAll of their statements and commitments were overshadowed by Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who was the star of proceedings. She took the stage at the United Nations and upbraided the political elites in her midst for their \u201cempty words\u201d and focus on \u201cmoney and fairy tales and eternal economic growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are failing us,\u201d she said. \u201cYoung people are beginning to understand your betrayal. If you choose to fail us, we will never forgive you.\u201d\n\nMany other figures \u2014 from multinational chief executives to U.S. governors \u2014 are expected to keep the climate conversation going through the week. But they\u2019ll have no help from the American president. Trump, who appeared only briefly at the climate session, dodged Thunberg\u2019s scolding but did not evade her laserlike stare when the two passed each other in the corridors of the United Nations.\n\nSommet de l'ONU: Greta Thunberg croise Donald Trump...et son regard en dit long pic.twitter.com/wC4VIeqFdw \u2014 BFMTV (@BFMTV) September 23, 2019\n\nIn a bit of counterprogramming, Trump presided over a meeting on \u201creligious freedom,\u201d a key plank of his administration\u2019s foreign policy messaging in the past couple of years. But Trump\u2019s efforts were met with a degree of cynicism, with critics noting that the president who campaigned on a vow to block Muslims immigrating to the United States was an unusual champion of religious pluralism.\n\nThe Iran affair: As has been the case for the past half-decade of U.N. confabs, all eyes will be on what does (or does not) happen between the American and Iranian delegations. A few weeks ago, there was plenty of speculation that Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani could even sit down for a shock meeting, no matter the opposition to such rapprochement in both Washington and Tehran.\n\nBut then an Iran-suspected attack on a major Saudi oil facility plunged the region into crisis and seemed to doom any prospect of a Rouhani-Trump sit-down. The perceived threat posed by Iran will probably feature in American and Saudi speeches this week, including Trump\u2019s Tuesday address.\n\n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is that Trump goes on a rhetorical rampage against Tehran similar to his \u2018little Rocket Man\u2019 attack on Kim Jong Un in 2017,\u201d suggested Gowan, adding that Trump \u201chas so far leaned toward restraint.\u201d\n\nBut both sides appear to be digging in their heels. Rouhani will outline a very different vision of Middle East security on Wednesday than Trump the day prior. Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative on Iran, told reporters Monday that the United States hoped diplomacy and \u201cpragmatism would prevail.\u201d But he also decried Tehran\u2019s \u201crevolutionary expansionism\u201d and pointed to increasing evidence that the Iranians were more isolated and enfeebled after Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign than in previous years.\n\n\u201cWe are resisting an unprovoked aggression by the United States,\u201d Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep. \u201cI can assure you that the United States will not be able to bring us to our knees through pressure.\u201d\n\nSome other speeches: Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Trump\u2019s hemispheric far-right comrade, shrugged off the advice of aides concerned about his recovery from a surgical procedure and will open proceedings Tuesday morning. The global controversy around his nationalist government\u2019s handling of fires in the Amazon will make his speech \u2014 his biggest international address since delivering a dud at the World Economic Forum in January \u2014 rather compelling. In an open letter, a group of Brazilian indigenous leaders decried Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201ccolonialist and ethnocidal\u201d policies.\n\nIn another major geopolitical set-piece, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan are expected to lash into each other over Kashmir, cross-border terrorism and other long-standing grievances dividing the South Asian rivals.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi \u2014 hailed jokingly by Trump as his \u201cfavorite dictator\u201d \u2014 will speak at the General Assembly even as protests against his iron-fisted rule continue in Cairo. And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will take the stage Wednesday and is also slated to meet Trump, an encounter that will probably be mobbed by the Washington press corps.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
