They could be on the field Sunday night when the Eagles (3-3) visit Dallas (3-3).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the first day of school,\u201d Mills said. \u201cAt this point, the mindset is to play the whole game. I\u2019ve done it before, coming off an injury in college.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles are 13-5 when Mills and Darby both play, including a victory over New England in Super Bowl 52 in which Tom Brady threw for 505 yards.\n\nMills suffered a foot injury last October that sidelined him nearly one full year. Darby has missed the past three games with a hamstring injury after tearing his ACL last November.\n\nThe Eagles are also missing cornerbacks Avonte Maddox and Cre\u2019Von LeBlanc. Rasul Douglas and Sidney Jones had a tough time in a 38-20 loss at Minnesota last Sunday, allowing four touchdown passes.\n\nOverall, the secondary has struggled the past two seasons. The Eagles have the fourth-most yards passing allowed this season. They were 30th against the pass last year and 17th in 2017 when they won the Super Bowl.\n\nFans hoping the team would acquire three-time Pro Bowl cornerback Jalen Ramsey were outraged when Jacksonville traded him to the Rams. Eagles coach Doug Pederson pointed to the players returning from injuries as an upgrade.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about the guys we have coming back and getting in the mix,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cThat\u2019s the encouraging part from our side.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more good news and some bad news on the injury front. Nine-time Pro Bowl left tackle Jason Peters has a knee injury that is expected to keep him sidelined for a while. Pederson said he\u2019s week to week. Rookie Andre Dillard will make his first career start in Peters\u2019 place.\n\nWide receiver DeSean Jackson is close to returning from an abdomen injury suffered in Week 2. It\u2019s possible he plays against the Cowboys.\n\nNotes: Jackson, Peters, Maddox (concussion, neck), LB Nigel Bradham (ankle), DT Fletcher Cox (illness), DT Timmy Jernigan (foot) and RB Darren Sproles (quadriceps) missed practice.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jalen Mills and Ronald Darby were back at practice Wednesday, boosting Philadelphia's depleted secondary.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Maaddi"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
