And, after suffering back-to-back knockout losses this year, the 23-year-old says he\u2019s taken a step back to take a step forward.\n\nPico (4-3 MMA, 4-3 BMMA) bounced back from a submission loss in his debut to reel off four first-round knockouts in a row as the hype started to build around him. But a first-round knockout loss to Henry Corrales, then a second-round finish at the hands of Adam Borics saw the Pico hype train hit the buffers in 2019.\n\nAnd after he was omitted from the Bellator featherweight grand prix lineup, Pico has stepped back from the cage and instead put himself to work at his new MMA home of Jackson Wink MMA in Albuquerque, N.M., where he says he\u2019s benefited from the time away from active competition.\n\n\u201cObviously, after a fight you lose, you want to go right back in,\u201d Pico told reporters, including MMA Junkie, on Tuesday at Dominance MMA media day. \u201cBut I think it was best for me to take some time off and really develop (and) let my body heal.\n\n\u201cI think it was the best for me, just so I can spend weeks with Greg and the other coaches there and really, really learn, rather than just jumping straight into fight camp. Because sometimes fight camp is different than actually out of fight camp.\n\n\u201cOut of camp you get to learn and try different things in training, so the time away from the cage was good for me, but now we should be looking for a fight soon and get back in the cage. I need it.\u201d\n\nPico admitted he had mixed emotions after his name wasn\u2019t included in the 16-man featherweight grand prix but, despite his competitive urges, he said being left out of the lineup was probably the best thing for his career development.\n\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019m like, \u2018There\u2019s a lot of guys that I feel like I can beat,\u2019 but right now I\u2019m enjoying my time not being in the tournament,\u201d Pico said. \u201cI don\u2019t really have to worry about that stress or have to worry about anything other than just taking one fight at a time. So in a way, it kind of makes sense that I\u2019m not in the tournament. Sometimes I go back and forth. Sometimes I wish I was, and then sometimes I\u2019m like, \u2018You know what? It\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m not.\u2019 But I think overall it\u2019s best that I\u2019m sitting out the tournament, for sure.\u201d\n\nInstead of mixing it up with Bellator\u2019s best 145 pounders in the tournament, Pico instead has been sharpening his skills at Jackson Wink, where he says he is benefiting hugely from the input received from coaches Greg Jackson, Mike Winkeljohn and Brandon Gibson.\n\n\u201cI feel really good being out in Albuquerque. I really, really enjoy it,\u201d Pico said. \u201cI love Greg Jackson, \u2018Six-Gun\u2019, Coach Wink, they\u2019ve done a really good job of breaking things down for me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really young in the game. I\u2019ve got skills, but I need to slow it down a little bit and really learn a lot. I\u2019m very fortunate (Greg) spends a lot of time with me, as do all of the coaches, so I feel really good being in Albuquerque, for sure.\u201d\n\nAnd after spending most of the summer in New Mexico improving his game, Pico says he\u2019s ready to get one more fight in the books before the end of 2019 as he looks to head into the New Year with some momentum.\n\n\u201cIt should be the end of November, beginning of December,\u201d he said of his return. \u201cWe should know soon. So we\u2019re just waiting on Bellator. I\u2019m ready, and we\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d\n\nWhen asked for his prediction for the featherweight grand prix, Pico had no doubt as he picked another of Bellator\u2019s rising stars to claim the crown.\n\n\u201cA.J. McKee,\u201d he said, without hesitation. \u201cI feel he\u2019ll win the tournament, hands down.\u201d", "description": "Following back-to-back defeats, Aaron Pico stepped away from competition to improve and hopes to return by the end of 2019.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "John Morgan", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/aaron-pico-dominance-media-day.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
