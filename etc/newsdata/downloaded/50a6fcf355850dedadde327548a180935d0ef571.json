Upcoming episodes of the ITV soap will see Sinead pass away after battling cervical cancer, with her final scenes due to air on Friday 25 October.\n\nSpeaking to the Loose Women panel about the heart-wrenching storyline, Katie opened up and said: \u2018I kind of underestimated the effects that it\u2019s had on my mental health.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve only just noticed it, walking away from it and filming, that part of me is breathing Sinead and it\u2019s bizarre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve started doing a fitness thing to safeguard myself and that\u2019s really helping me mentally.\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018I sound silly saying it but I believe Sinead is real. I played her for six-and-a-half years. Me and Corrie created this character and I feel like she\u2019s my friend.\n\nSinead passes away from cancer this week in Coronation Street (Picture: ITV)\n\n\u2018Watching her die was just awful, but it\u2019s raising awareness and I just hope that we are doing that.\u2019\n\nSinead\u2019s world came crashing down on her wedding day, when her auntie Beth (Lisa George) discovered a lump in her neck.\n\nThe following day, Sinead and husband Daniel (Rob Mallard) went to the doctors to get the lump checked out and they were left devastated to discover that the young mum\u2019s cancer had spread to her lymph nodes and her liver, meaning she only had only months left to live.\n\nKatie added that she asked Coronation Street bosses to lose Sinead to cancer.\n\n\u2018I protested for her to die,\u2019 she said. I just thought if I\u2019m doing this storyline, I want to do it properly.\n\n\u2018I love this storyline because it covers so many issues. I just wanted to highlight the fact people are dying of cancer.\u2019\n\nLoose Women airs weekdays at 12.30pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
