There's work to be done.\"\n\nEU officials think the only solution will be an arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland in the customs union - the so-called Northern Ireland-only backstop.\n\nNegotiators' focus will now be on whether the deal is explicit in that or whether the two sides can come up with a compromise that could see Northern Ireland remain in the customs territories of both the UK and the EU, the officials said.\n\nWhile there's no discussion yet of putting a time limit on the arrangements -- something the EU has previously rejected -- one EU official said that it could yet be considered.\n\nAny agreement would have to be backed by Parliament in London, where Johnson is reliant on the DUP. The group is staunchly opposed to the region being subject to different customs rules to the rest of the UK.\n\nIn a statement, DUP Leader Arlene Foster fired a warning shot against any attempt to keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union, although, crucially, she didn't go as far as explicitly withholding support from the prime minister.\n\n\"Those who know anything about Northern Ireland will appreciate that these issues will only work with the support of the unionist as well as the nationalist community,\" she said.\n\nWhile negotiations are heading into a new intensive phase, they aren't headed into the full \"tunnel,\" the formal Brussels process by which the actual legal text of an agreement is thrashed out in secret.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis suggests that the EU still has reservations about the chances of getting a deal done, and that member states are unwilling to outsource the process entirely to Barnier and his team.\n\nThe Frenchman will update the EU's national envoys Sunday, with the aim of having something concrete for EU affairs ministers to look at when they meet in Luxembourg on Tuesday to prepare for the summit.\n\nFor all the fresh optimism, there is still a long way to go.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the UK hadn't yet \"come forward with a workable, realistic proposal.\" But he added that he had seen \"promising signals.\" The next week will see whether those noises turn into an agreement on paper.\n\nBloomberg", "description": "The UK and EU have gone into three days of intensive talks after Boris Johnson finally indicated he was prepared to make enough concessions to allow for detailed negotiations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4842%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_401%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/04f65addfc3b63f97c53c6ec20b15b904ffd35fc", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
