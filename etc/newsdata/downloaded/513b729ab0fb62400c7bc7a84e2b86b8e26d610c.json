The \u201cshow about nothing\u201d, created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, ran for nine seasons from 1989 until it ended in 1998, but clearly still lives large in US viewers\u2019 consciousness. So too does Friends, which has just turned 25 and is still the subject of formidable bidding wars between streaming services hungry for the re-run rights.\n\nMore like this\n\n- A teen reimagining of House of Cards\n\n- How Friends changed our idea of family\n\n- The best TV shows of 2019 so far\n\nHowever, there is another show about a group of quirky friends living in one of the US\u2019s biggest cities that has quietly become a phenomenon in their wake. It eschews both the middle-class minutiae of Seinfeld, and the will-they-won\u2019t-they romances of Friends \u2013 in favour of crystal meth, kitten mittens, and accidental kidnappings. In the process, It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia has become the best sitcom in the US, tackling everything from gun reform to Time\u2019s Up with an irreverent, unmistakable lens. It\u2019s also become one of its longest-running \u2013 this week the show returns for a historic 14th season, a feat only matched by the rather more wholesome 1950s classic The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.\n\nThe show comes from humble beginnings. It was initially conceived as a short film after its stars and co-creators Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton and Charlie Day met in Los Angeles, where they were all out-of-work actors trying to catch a break. The concept was simple \u2013 as Howerton explained to the New York Times in a 2007 interview, it was to focus on \u201ca group of friends who care so little for each other\u201d.\n\nUtilising their inordinate amount of free time as unemployed thespians, they cobbled together a pilot episode, shot on a digital camcorder with no budget. After shopping their homemade DVD to various networks, it was enough to convince Fox subsidiary channel FX to give them the go-ahead for a full series. But while the per-episode budget of $450,000 was a considerable improvement on nothing, it was still less than a third of the network standard, positioning the show as an underdog right from the off.\n\nA divisive start\n\nFollowing slight tweaks from its pilot iteration, It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia was born, centring on a group of terrible friends who run Paddy\u2019s Pub together: Charlie (Charlie Day), Mac (Rob McElhenney), Dennis (Glenn Howerton) and his sister Dee (Caitlin Olsen).\n\nThe same year, CBS premiered How I Met Your Mother, and NBC\u2019s remake of The Office first aired. The general tone of sitcoms of the period was considerably lighter and less risqu\u00e9 than It\u2019s Always Sunny: in the first season alone, topics covered included underage drinking, cancer, and gun control. Against the backdrop of a cautious, post-9/11, second-Bush-term US, the show was a breath of fresh air.\n\nIt is smug enough to think it\u2019s breaking ground, but not smart enough to know it isn\u2019t \u2013 Gillian Flynn\n\nHowever, despite garnering largely positive reviews, not everyone was a fan; in a 2005 review for Entertainment Weekly, Gillian Flynn \u2013 who would go on to become the best-selling author of Gone Girl and Sharp Objects \u2013 said \u201cit is smug enough to think it's breaking ground, but not smart enough to know it isn't\u201d. It also struggled in the ratings, and so McElhenney and co were instructed to add a big-name star to the cast for the second series in a bid to improve its performance. Thus came Danny Devito, cast as Dee and Dennis\u2019s rich absentee father, Frank.\n\nIt would be remiss to suggest that the rest was history, and that It\u2019s Always Sunny hit its stride purely because of the addition of one of Hollywood\u2019s most recognisable stars to its main cast \u2013 but certainly the cultural cache that Devito brought helped the show become a cult hit. It achieved particular popularity with university students, especially those based in Philadelphia (although almost all of the show is shot on soundstages in Los Angeles). In 2008, Jonathan Storm of The Philadelphia Inquirer described the show as \u201clike Seinfeld on crack\u201d, which FX adopted as a tagline.\n\nWhile many other sitcoms have come and gone, amid the rise of prestige television, this scrappy underdog has quietly continued to develop its cult following. With shorter seasons than standard American sitcoms \u2013 each averaging 13 20-minute episodes \u2013 and a deceptively simple premise, it continues to buck trends.\n\nEven though the show is an unapologetically US beast, perfectly transitioning from Bush to Obama to Trump-eras during the course of its impressive run, it\u2019s found a uniquely dedicated fanbase around the world too: overseas, Comedy Central and Netflix have been instrumental in connecting global audiences with the strange world of Charlie, Mac, Dee, Dennis and Frank.\n\nIn the UK, It\u2019s Always Sunny quizzes and fan nights have been springing up, with fans gathering to test their knowledge, recreate some of the show\u2019s iconic moments, or simply watch a bunch of episodes in a communal space. Michael Hall works in programming and outreach at East London\u2019s Genesis Cinema, where It\u2019s Always Sunny nights in their bar have become a mainstay. \u201cWe have games of Flip-Cup, themed cocktails, we deck the bar out with Paddy\u2019s signs \u2013 we've even had live music. Hearing a hundred people sing along to a wordless theme tune is a surreal joy,\u201d he explains.\n\nThe secret of its success\n\nSo how to explain its ever-growing appeal? Part of it lies in its singularly nihilistic tone. Given the uncertain social, political, and literal climate of 2019, it makes sense that a comedy which delights in human misery would resonate with audiences so deeply. \u201cI started watching It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia on DVD during the hazy period between the end of high school and the beginning of college,\u201d recalls culture writer Dan Schindel, a Maryland native now based in New York. \u201cGiven the constant precariousness the characters find themselves in, I think it makes sense that it would appeal to me in such a time of my life. And then later I graduated college and it turned out our times would be marked by constant precariousness, so the show would never not be apropos!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s managed to make great points on race and sexuality despite giving off the appearance of being a moral void - Michael Hall, organiser of It\u2019s Always Sunny nights\n\nThat nihilism is matched by a refreshingly cynical approach to characterisation. While the leads in other sitcoms mature over time, \u2018The Gang\u2019 only seem to become more unpleasant. There are no life lessons \u2013 instead, in the vein of Seinfeld\u2019s famous \u201cno hugging, no learning\u201d mantra, pathos is often eschewed in favour of escalating hijinks.\n\nIn actual fact though, it has more depth than its scuzzy surface would suggest. As Hall says \u201cthere\u2019s a feeling of freedom to a show where everyone is a scumbag\u201d \u2013 and with that freedom \u201cit\u2019s managed to make great points on race and sexuality despite giving off the appearance of being a moral void.\u201d It unapologetically skewers hot-button subjects most shows dance around. In its very first episode, \u2018The Gang Gets Racist\u2019, for example, Charlie attempts to prove to the woman he is in love with that he is not racist by seeking out black friends. While in its recent 13th season, \u2018Time\u2019s Up For the Gang\u2019 saw the Sunny crew try to address sexual harassment in the workplace, after being placed on a \u2018Worst Bars List\u2019 \u2013 with predictably disastrous results.\n\nMeanwhile, it has found artistic inspiration in a range of likely and unlikely sources, from classic comedy fare such as The Three Stooges to Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s The Master and Daniel Keyes\u2019 sci-fi novella Flowers for Algernon. Incidentally, last season McElhenney and co paid tribute to Seinfeld episode The Contest in \u2018The Gang Does A Clip Show\u2019, indicating a fondness for their revered predecessor. But while Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer were, by and large, decent, upstanding members of society, Charlie, Mac, Dee, Dennis and Frank are their looking glass counterparts: damaged, difficult emblems of awfulness.\n\nIt also has come to show real heart, unexpectedly \u2013 as in \u2018Mac Finds His Pride\u2019, the final episode of It\u2019s Always Sunny\u2019s 13th season, in which Mac decided to come out as gay to his father, a stern, uncommunicative felon. In a piercing, beautifully-choreographed set piece, McElhenney executes an emotional piece of modern dance, while Danny Devito\u2019s Frank looks on in amazement. \u201cNow I get it,\u201d he whispers, tears forming in his eyes.\n\nAfter so long on the air, there is of course a question over whether It\u2019s Always Sunny can continue to keep things fresh. With a show as sharp-toothed as this, it\u2019s crucial that it retains its bite. Nevertheless breaking the \u201cNo hugging, no learning\u201d rule every once in a while is no bad thing. The jokes still range from pleasingly juvenile to bafflingly surreal, and the tone seems as sardonic as it ever was, but there\u2019s some warmth too \u2013 and after 14 years, It\u2019s Always Sunny has earned it, as well as a place in the comedy Hall of Fame.\n\nSeason 14 of It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia premieres on the FXX channel in the US on 25 September\n\nLove TV?
