They've been married 66 years and have four kids. He's the only one who actually takes care of them; if we're on vacation, he has to make arrangements for one or two of his siblings to come look after them. My husband is then constantly texting with his siblings, and the barrage of texts from them never stops. Otherwise they don't really talk.\n\nHis father has been nasty to me many a time. My husband always looked the other way. He finally admitted his father is a jerk, but he keeps catering to his father's every passive-aggressive whim.\n\nWe've been to counseling, and he said he'd work on things, but his actions speak louder than words. He gets upset when I ask for boundaries: \"They are my family \u2014 what am I supposed to do?\"\n\nOh and by the way, we don't have kids; when that topic came up, my husband said, \"If we have a kid, who'll take care of my parents?\"\n\nHow do I navigate this tricky situation? I don't want them out of our life, but I do want them out of our marriage.\n\nThe hubs was married before and that didn't last . . . wonder why.\n\n\u2014 At a Loss\n\nAt a Loss: They will be out of your marriage when they die, or when your husband is ready to seek help for real.\n\nAnd even if your marriage manages to survive his parents, the dysfunction they raised their son to treat as normal \u2014 and to internalize as his marching orders \u2014 will outlive them, surviving in him until he sees fit to exorcise it.\n\nI don\u2019t like his chances for doing that. Not when he thinks there\u2019s anything normal or healthy about opting out of his own children because his duty is to remain a child himself.\n\nThere are countless good reasons not to have kids; being too enmeshed to believe they\u2019re possible is not one of them.\n\nSeriously \u2014 if that conversation with you wasn\u2019t enough to trigger in him a this-is-not-normal epiphany, then I don\u2019t know what will.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019ll take a second divorce.\n\nFor your part, it\u2019s worth asking yourself why you didn\u2019t put your foot down then \u2014 or earlier, well before marrying this.\n\nI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry you weren\u2019t in a position to see this coming, for whatever reason; I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re unhappy; I\u2019m sorry your in-laws are so twisted; I\u2019m sorry they ensnared your husband; I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s not even able to see they did that. This is a sad situation all around.\n\nWhat it doesn\u2019t appear to be, though, is \u201ctricky.\u201d The facts as you lay them out couldn\u2019t get much simpler or clearer: His parents are your husband\u2019s top priority and he doesn\u2019t intend to change that.\n\nPlease give counseling another try, except go alone. The question you were asking the first time \u2014 \u201cHow do we fix our marriage?\u201d \u2014 took for granted that your husband agreed there was something to fix and was willing to fix it. Now you know you\u2019re the only one willing to change, so you have new questions to answer: \u201cHow did I get here, and can I make it a place I want to stay?\u201d", "description": "Her husband doesn\u2019t seem to intend to change, so she should try counseling on her own.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "September At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
