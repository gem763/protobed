If a member of the public in a public place is asked by police officers to remove the face covering to verify his identity, he may wear it again after the verification process is completed, said Cheng.\n\nA masked protester participate in a demonstration in Hong Kong. [Photo/China Daily]\n\n\"Interference with a person's rights is minimal, and in any event proportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting public safety and public order,\" she said.\n\nOther than the specified circumstances set out in the new regulation, people are generally free to wear face masks and the impact on their daily lives is limited, she added.\n\nThe secretary for justice also clarified that in enacting the anti-mask regulation, there is no issue of the Legislative Council being circumvented. \"The new regulation, which is a piece of subsidiary legislation, is made pursuant to the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and has to be laid on the table of the Legislative Council which may by resolution amend the regulation,\" she said.\n\nCheng pointed out that prohibiting persons from using face covering would facilitate police investigation and administration of justice and would as well deter them from acting in an unlawful manner on the basis that they may act with impunity by concealing their identity.\n\n\"The protests and confrontations have continued for almost four months. We hope that the new measure could help curb the spread of violence and restore social order. We also urge the understanding and support of the public in our work,\" she said.", "description": "HONG KONG - The secretary for justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government stressed on Sunday that the anti-mask regulation will help reduce act of violence and in devising the new regulation the HKSAR government has given due consideration to human rights guarantees.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/13/5da2afc8a310cf3e97a101be.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
