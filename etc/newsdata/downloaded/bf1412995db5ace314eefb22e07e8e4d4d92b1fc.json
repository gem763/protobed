If you knew anything, you wouldn\u2019t support this lot.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\nHe cheerfully recalls his ticking-off from another famous resident of Windsor, the Duke of Edinburgh, who lambasted him for driving around a royal estate in an Aston Martin painted in Watford colours - yellow with a red and black stripe down the middle.\n\n\u201cRidiculous. Makes you look like a bloody fool. Get rid of it,\u201d chuntered Prince Philip.\n\nAnd Sir Elton remembers another dressing-down when he turned up for a Boxing Day fixture at Watford \u201chungover after a mammoth coke bender\u201d and helped himself to generous measures of whisky from the boardroom.\n\n(Image: Zuma Press/PA Images)\n\nThe man delivering the lecture, in no uncertain terms, was Taylor, Watford\u2019s greatest manager, who died in January 2017.\n\nBut the magic carpet ride Taylor navigated was worth more than winning football matches. Sir Elton wrote: \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of what we achieved together, but I owe Watford far more than Watford owe me.\n\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had the football club, then God knows what would have happened to me. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say I think Watford might have saved my life.\n\n(Image: INTERNET PICTURE)\n\n\u201cI was chairman throughout the worst period of my life: years of addiction and unhappiness, failed relationships, bad business deals, court cases, unending turmoil. Through all of that, Watford were a constant source of happiness to me.\n\n\u201cFor obvious reasons, there are chunks of the eighties I have no recollection of \u2013 but every Watford game I saw is permanently etched on my memory.\n\n\u201cThe night we knocked Manchester United out of the League Cup at Old Trafford, when we were still a third Division side, the newspapers that never normally bothered about writing about Watford were calling them Elton John\u2019s Rocket Men the next morning.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe night in November 1982 when we were away to Nottingham Forest in the Milk Cup: They beat us 7-3 but I thought it was one of the greatest games of football I had ever seen in my life.\n\n\u201cForest\u2019s legendary manager Brian Clough agreed with me, before turning to Graham (Taylor) and telling him he would never allow his chairman to sit on the bloody touchline the way I did.\u201d\n\nWith hilarious self-deprecation, the Hornets life president also remembers the grand old game\u2019s backlash when he revealed he was gay.\n\nOn reflection, he came to realise it was a brave announcement for the new chairman of a football club who spent his Saturday afternoons listening to rival supporters serenading him with an unflattering refrain to the tune of My Old Man Said Follow The Van.\n\nInstead of delivering a lecture denouncing homophobia in football, Elton admits: \u201cI have to be honest: I thought it was funny, Mortifying, but funny.\u201d\n\n*Me Elton John, published by Pan Macmillan, \u00a325 hardback.", "description": "The legendary musician was formerly Hornets chairman and oversaw five promotions and a journey to the FA Cup final", "authors": ["Mike Walters", "Image", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Zuma Press Pa Images", "Internet Picture", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637432.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_LCP_CHP_161019EltonJohnWatford_4252EltonJohnWatfordJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
