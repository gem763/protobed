A walk through the heart of Tokyo in Chuo City brought one lamppost advert, depicting Japan\u2019s famous victory over South Africa four years ago.\n\nBut perhaps the most telling thing was that after a short flight to Miyazaki where England are holding a 10-day training camp at the Sheraton Hotel, there was not a single advert, only two banners that read \u201cWelcome England Rugby Team\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But it is fairly unusual given that every pillar in the arrivals terminal is dedicated to sport advertising of some kind \u2013 only it is for the 2019 ISA World Surfing Games and the Japan LPGA Tour Championship Ricoh Cup which is being held nearly a month after the Rugby World Cup.\n\nYou may be asking how there is not more awareness of the Rugby World Cup in Tokyo given the vast space available to advertise such a tournament, and the answer is down to one very obvious factor: Tokyo 2020.\n\nJapan is proud to be holding the summer Olympic Games next year, for the second time in its history, with reminders of the tournament stretching from buildings to bus stops, taxis to leaflets.\n\nBut it must be said that where the IOC have triumphed, World Rugby have not. The Japan 2019 hosting board appear to see the next two months as a tune up to the real big thing next year. It\u2019s an opportunity missed, not just for Japan, but for the sport of rugby union.\n\nYours,\n\nJack de Menezes\n\nDeputy sports editor", "description": "As the 20 best rugby squads in the world descended on Japan, combating typhoons and lengthy travel delays to begin their World Cup journey, I\u2019m sorry to say you wouldn\u2019t know it if you were a Japanese native.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/10/england-rugby.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
