He needs the top of everybody's page when they go to Google to be impeachment, impeachment, impeachment because he doesn't want you talking about the economy.\n\n\"He doesn't want you talking about border security. He doesn't want any of the accomplishments that this president has put forth to be highlighted.\"", "description": "Amid the\u00a0ongoing battle between\u00a0President Trump and Democrats over the House impeachment inquiry, \"The Five\" addressed the continuing saga -- as well as former Vice President Joe Biden throwing his support behind impeaching the commander-in-chief.", "authors": ["Victor Garcia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/juan-trump-biden-bila.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
