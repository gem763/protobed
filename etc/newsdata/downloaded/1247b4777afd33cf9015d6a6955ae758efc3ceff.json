REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nJohnson says he wants to take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal with the bloc. But he lost his parliamentary majority this week and expelled 21 lawmakers from his Conservative Party\u2019s group in parliament after they supported an opposition plan to try to block a no-deal exit.\n\nRudd, also a former interior minister who voted remain in the 2016 Brexit referendum, said the ousting of the rebel lawmakers, who included the grandson of Britain\u2019s wartime leader Winston Churchill and two former finance ministers, was an \u201cassault on decency and democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have resigned from Cabinet and surrendered the Conservative whip,\u201d Rudd said on her Twitter account.\n\n\u201cI cannot stand by as good, loyal moderate Conservatives are expelled. I have spoken to the PM and my association chairman to explain,\u201d she said.\n\nBrexit remains up in the air more than three years after Britons voted to leave the EU. Options range from a turbulent no-deal exit to abandoning the whole endeavour.\n\nIn her resignation letter to Johnson, who succeeded Theresa May as prime minister in July, Rudd said: \u201cI joined your cabinet in good faith: Accepting that \u2018no deal\u2019 had to be on the table, because it was the means by which we would have the best chance of achieving a new deal to leave on 31 October.\n\n\u201cHowever I no longer believe leaving with a deal is the government\u2019s main objective.\u201d\n\nThe Sunday Times reported that at least six cabinet members share Rudd\u2019s views, with at least one also considering resigning.\n\nRudd\u2019s resignation caps a tumultuous week for Johnson that has also seen his own brother Jo quit the government, saying he was \u201ctorn between family loyalty and the national interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prime minister has run out of authority in record time and his Brexit plan has been exposed as a sham,\u201d said Ian Lavery, chair of the main opposition Labour Party.\n\n\u201cNo one trusts Boris Johnson. Not his Cabinet, not his MPs, not even his own brother.\u201d\n\nJohnson says the only solution to the Brexit impasse is a new election, which he wants to take place on Oct. 15, allowing him to win a new mandate with two weeks left to leave the bloc on time. He needs two-thirds of parliament\u2019s lawmakers to back an early election.\n\nBut opposition parties, including Labour, said they would either vote against or abstain on calls for an election until a law to force Johnson to seek a Brexit delay is implemented.\n\nFILE PHOTO - Britain's Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Amber Rudd leaves the Houses of Parliament, in London, Britain, September 4, 2019. REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nOn Saturday it emerged lawmakers are preparing legal action as they believe Johnson could try to defy the legislation compelling him to seek a further delay to Brexit.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph reported that Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s top aide, is creating a shadow team of advisors to work on plans to fight an expected emergency judicial review in Britain\u2019s highest court, the supreme court, next month if Johnson is unable to secure an election next week.\n\nAn opinion poll on election voting intentions carried out by YouGov for the Sunday Times put the Conservatives on 35%, Labour on 21%, the pro-remain Liberal Democrats on 19% and the Brexit Party on 12%.", "description": "Britain's Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd resigned from the government and the ruling Conservative Party on Saturday in a protest over Prime Minister Boris Johnson's handling of the country's departure from the European Union.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427378470&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF86112", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
