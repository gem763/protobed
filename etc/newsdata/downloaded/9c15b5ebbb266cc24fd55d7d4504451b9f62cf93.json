They deserve to grow up thinking that they can be anything they want,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen a government is scared by a children\u2019s book promoting equality, that means that promoting these messages through children\u2019s literature can have and is having an impact, and it makes me even more motivated to keep fighting every day.\u201d\n\nThe book has been a publishing phenomenon since emerging in 2016 from one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns ever, spawning sequels, spinoffs and many copycats.\n\nThe only difficulty it encountered previously was Russia\u2019s decision to censor the story of a transgender girl profiled in the book, Cavallo said.\n\n\u201cFinding women who have overcome the obstacles of a gendered world dangerous shows the mindset of rulers in Turkey,\u201d said Murat Celikkan, of the Human Rights Association in Istanbul.\n\n\u201cNow I am much more anxious about the future of my five-year-old daughter in this country.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish publishers\u2019 association released a statement this week, saying the government decision was \u201ca danger from the perspective of freedoms of expression and press, and a threat to the principles of a democratic society\u201d.\n\nThe book\u2019s Turkish publisher told AFP they were waiting for the decision to be officially communicated to them before commenting.", "description": "Istanbul (AFP) \u2013 Turkey has ruled that the million-selling book \u201cGood Night Stories for Rebel Girls\u201d book should be partially banned and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
