While 35-year-olds had the highest student loan debt balance on average, the average balances of 60-year-olds didn't fall far behind.\n\nThe average student loan balance of borrowers aged 60 to 69 is up $1,700 since the second quarter of 2018, to $35,637. Compare that to 30-year-old student loan borrowers, who face an average balance of $36,406 in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nThere's a correlation that explains why so many 60-year-olds are taking on student loan debt: They're increasingly taking out loans for their children. A separate Experian study looked at data from federal student loans, and the amount borrowed by parents for children. Since 2015, the data shows that the number of parents borrowing parent PLUS loans for their children has gone up by 13%. Over the same time period, the amount borrowed has also increased by 38%.\n\nIncreasingly, parents who are nearing or at retirement age are taking on student loan debt for their children. And for a generation that's already not prepared for retirement, that's a problem.\n\nAs Business Insider's Tanza Loudenback reports, 48% of Gen Xers have less than $50,000 saved for retirement, according to data from a survey of Gen Xers conducted by Insider and Morning Consult. For most who want to retire at age 65, that amount won't meet their needs.\n\nSupporting adult children through college and beyond is a potentially unexpected retirement expense that's become common. According to a Merrill Lynch survey, 79% of parents are still supporting their adult and college-age children while in retirement.\n\nThe high student loan balances many 60-year-olds face could delay their retirement. Even so, Experian's data shows that for an increasing number of parents, dealing with student loans for their children's college expenses in retirement is becoming a reality.", "description": "Retiring 60-year-old Americans face student loan debts almost as high as 30-year-olds, likely because they're borrowing for their kids' college.", "authors": ["Liz Knueven"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8530e42e22af1de34841da-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
