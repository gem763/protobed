He applied to a number of artist residencies, and one place accepted him \u2013 the Bemis Centre for Contemporary Arts in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s the most populous city in the state, Omaha feels remote and typically midwestern. Aside from billionaire Warren Buffet, who was born in the city and has attracted a number of Fortune 500 companies to settle there, the city\u2019s claims to fame are mostly practical and unglamorous \u2013 Omaha is the home of TV dinners and raisin bran.\n\nIt was a far cry from San Francisco, or even Halpern\u2019s home city of Buffalo, New York. But the contrast proved invigorating. The aggressive, rough-hewn masculinity idealised in the local culture, through which vulnerability and loneliness can be occasionally glimpsed, quickly became Halpern\u2019s main photographic subject.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

His subjects are often young men, the kind who wouldn\u2019t appreciate showing much vulnerability before a camera or to an outsider. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Halpern told The Independent of approaching his subjects. \u201cI still get nervous because I\u2019m actually quite introverted, and I have to work up the energy. I try to be extremely respectful, positive, honest and direct about what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, Halpern released the photobook Omaha Sketchbook, in which small prints were tacked to a duplicate of his own sketchbook made from coloured construction paper from an Omaha art store. This presentation mirrored the intimate, personal nature of his work in the city, full of the mundanity and ambivalence which will be familiar to residents of minor cities everywhere. Now, he\u2019s released an updated version of the book, having returned to Omaha after the 2016 election which saw Nebraska gripped by Maga fever.\n\nHe didn\u2019t include any Trump rallies in his updated book, feeling the images were simplistic towards the point of caricature. \u201cWith a portrait, there has to be something that defies expectations,\u201d he says. \u201cSomething beautiful in a totally non-traditional sense of the word. Something that surprises or unsettles or nags at you. Something that makes you think, not something that simply reaffirms what you already know or feel.\u201d His pictures have a dreamy, lost-in-time quality. But as America turns towards the midwest to understand its own political climate, his work feels precisely relevant.\n\n\u2018Omaha Sketchbook\u2019 is published by MACK; Gregory Halpern\u2019s work is at the Huxley Gallery, London, until 12 October 2019", "description": "In 2004, photographer Gregory Halpern was living in San Francisco, fresh out of graduate school, barely employed and seriously uninspired.
