Bernie Sanders canceled several planned Iowa events to recover from a heart attack, but his Iowa campaign staff are moving forward with or without him on the stump.\n\nSanders, who was hospitalized the night of Oct. 1 to have two stents inserted to clear blockages in his heart, has no current plans to return to Iowa. His only public event scheduled now is Tuesday's televised debate in Ohio.\n\nTuesday evening, he told reporters assembled outside of his home in Burlington, Vermont, that he's going to \"change the nature of the campaign a bit, and make sure I have the strength to do what I need to do.\"\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidate told NBC News on Wednesday he plans to \"get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,\" albeit one where \"I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.\"\n\nWhat that means for Sanders' Iowa campaign strategy wasn't immediately clear. Sanders canceled one Iowa swing immediately after he was hospitalized and a second appearance at an Iowa labor forum, planned for Oct. 13. Sanders is slated to participate in a Des Moines forum on issues important to Latino voters on Oct. 24, but his campaign staff couldn't confirm if that would happen.\n\nBefore his heart attack, when Sanders would campaign through Iowa, he'd pack his schedule with town halls, forums and rallies. At the end of September, his most recent visit, he held 11 public events over four days, starting in Des Moines before moving from north-central Iowa down to its southeast corner. During those four days, he also included two events in Oklahoma.\n\nThe heart attack led the campaign to delay a $1.3 million ad buy on Iowa TV markets. The two-week buy launched Tuesday, four days after it initially planned to air, campaign spokesperson Bill Neidhardt said.\n\nThe Iowa campaign hasn't stopped, however. In early October, the campaign's national co-chair, U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna of California, traveled across Iowa as volunteers canvassed neighborhoods and worked phonebanks.\n\n\"We began this campaign with the intent to win Iowa, and we continue to intend to win Iowa,\" Neidhardt said.\n\nIowa tends to see fewer presidential candidates in the days leading up to televised Democratic debates, so Sanders' absence does not stand out as much as it would during other stretches. The Des Moines Register's candidate event tracker showed a bare schedule wrapping up October among all candidates.\n\nSanders, so far, has held the most public events in Iowa among the top-polling candidates. Among candidates with more than 1% support in the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, only U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has held 85 events, has had more Iowa stops than Sanders. Sanders has held 76 Iowa events this cycle.\n\nBut campaigns tend to come to Iowa more frequently in the fall and winter leading up to the February caucuses. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris in particular has said she plans to focus on the first-in-the-nation nominating contest to prove her mettle as a candidate. She was in Iowa the first weekend of October and will be back next weekend.\n\nSam Roecker, a Democratic strategist and consultant, said Sanders' absence from the campaign trail likely won't hurt him as much as it would a lesser-known candidate. But Sanders will need to keep his name in the national conversation and pivot focus away from concerns of his health and fitness for the job.\n\n\"It's up in the air,\" Roecker said. \"We're still at that point where people haven't made up their mind on who they're going to caucus for.\"\n\nBut Sanders' health scare has not dissuaded his most fervent supporters.\n\nAlyssa Rooney, a 25-year-old social worker in Waterloo, has supported Sanders since the 2016 race. She points to his demanding schedule, routine of walks and basketball, and general vigor during campaign stops as evidence of overall physical fitness.\n\n\"People have health issues all the time,\" Rooney said in an interview. \"Young people have health issues. For me, I read that he had this health scare but he was OK. For me, that was the end of it. It happened, but he can move on from it.\n\n\"I still believe he's the best person for the job.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Des Moines Register: Election 2020: Bernie Sanders plans return to 'very vigorous campaign'", "description": "U.S. Sen.
