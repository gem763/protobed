Where most people see this only as pollution, Chicago-based LanzaTech considers it opportunity.\n\nThe biotech startup has developed a way to turn emissions into ethanol, a renewable fuel that is commonly used in US gasoline.\n\n\"Instead of letting carbon emissions come out of a steel mill, we capture them, we put them in our bio reactor and ferment -- just like making beer -- to make ethanol,\" said LanzaTech CEO Jennifer Holmgren.\n\nThe key to the process is a gas-eating bacteria developed specifically for fermentation. The company says the bacteria feeds on the emissions, rather than feeding on sugar or corn, to generate ethanol.\n\nLanzaTech's first commercial plant in China\n\n\"It's a naturally occurring organism, and what we've done is directed evolution so that we've optimized it,\" she said.\n\nRead More", "description": "Chicago-based LanzaTech has developed a way to capture greenhouse gas emissions from steel mills, factories and refineries into turn it into ethanol, a renewable fuel that is commonly used in U.S. gasoline.", "authors": ["Millie Dent"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191023155307-01-lanzatech-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
