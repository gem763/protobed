That put the upstart trading company \u2014 made famous by Michael Lewis\u2019s 2014 book \u201cFlash Boys\u201d \u2014 in head-to-head competition with heavyweights like Nasdaq Inc. NDAQ, +0.10% and the New York Stock Exchange, run by the Intercontinental Exchange Inc. ICE, +0.38%.\n\nHowever, after Greenwich, Conn.-based online brokerage Interactive Brokers Group Inc. IBKR, +0.45% became IEX\u2019s first listing about a year ago, the new exchange has struggled to woo other corporate executives to list shares on its venue and now believes that the costs associated with trying to attract new listings aren\u2019t worth the effort. The Financial Times in a recent report, citing fundraising documents, said IEX had aimed to draw some 250 companies (paywall).\n\nInteractive Brokers, founded by Wall Street trading icon Thomas Peterffy, will return to its original listing venue, Nasdaq, early next month, Katsuyama said, adding that Peterffy remains an advocate of IEX and its mission.\n\n\u2018We knew the fight that we were getting into when we entered the exchange space on the listings side, it was a battle that ended up being a steeper hill than we thought.\u2019 Brad Katsuyama\n\nFounded about seven years ago, IEX has carved out a niche as a champion of the average investor and has advocated for fairness in trading on Wall Street exchanges. The company, heralded in the Lewis book, is perhaps best known for implementing a so-called speed bump on its exchange to thwart high-frequency traders, or HFTs, employing lightning-fast computers to make money from differences in stock prices on various trading venues and at various times throughout the trading day.\n\nKatsuyama told MarketWatch that his interest in veering into the listing business was partly prompted by the attention his company had garnered from the Lewis book and the company\u2019s desire to apply its speed-bump technology to other areas on Wall Street. However, the IEX CEO said, \u201cthe desire of an executive to want to change their listings didn\u2019t translate\u201d to companies switching trading venues. Katsuyama also said companies tend to require unanimous board-level approvals, not just a majority, which made it even more difficult.\n\n\u201cIt was more challenging to get commitments than we thought,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe knew the fight that we were getting into when we entered the exchange space on the listings side, it was a battle that ended up being a steeper hill than we thought,\u201d Katsuyama said.\n\nThat said, the IEX founder said that the company\u2019s core trading business remains very healthy and that the listings business represents 1/10th of 1% of its revenue.\n\n\u201cOur core trading business has grown to become the 8th-largest stock exchange company globally, trading more daily notional volume than the London Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange,\u201d he said.\n\nThe executive said he was happy with new ventures the company is set to launch, including an order type geared toward corporate buybacks. The exchange uses its proprietary technology, IEX Signal, to help companies repurchase shares without being front-run by enterprising HFTs.\n\nKatsuyama told the FT in an interview this summer that he feels like many on Wall Street don\u2019t want the company to succeed.\n\n\u201cPeople want us to fail. I think from that perspective we\u2019re really proud of where we are, but there\u2019s a lot more to do,\u201d he told the paper then.\n\n\u201cThe people who don\u2019t like IEX are obviously going to take shots, but we think it\u2019s a smart business decision,\u201d Katsuyama told MarketWatch, regarding the decision to abandon listings.", "description": "Startup Investors Exchange, or IEX Group Inc., plans to exit from the cutthroat business of serving stock listings, to focus on its bread-and-butter trading...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GL962_iex_ce_ZG_20180703143814.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
