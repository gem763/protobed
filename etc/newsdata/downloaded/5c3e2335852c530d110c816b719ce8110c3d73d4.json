Plumes of smoke could be seen rising over the capital as casualties were transported to a nearby hospital.\n\nThe Taliban said in a statement that it had targeted a convoy of foreigners.\n\nBut no foreign convoy can be seen in footage circulating on social media, which appeared to show a van entering a crowded traffic circle before detonating. The footage shows only passenger vehicles and some pedestrians, including one who appears to try to run from the scene just before the bomb detonated.\n\nThe United States and the Taliban completed their ninth round of talks in Qatar on Sunday, and top U.S. negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad then flew straight to Kabul to brief officials here on the proposed plan.\n\nThe draft agreement would see 5,400 U.S. troops leave Afghanistan and five U.S. bases close within about five months, pending President Trump\u2019s approval\n\nThe Afghan government has been excluded from peace talks with the Taliban, and on Wednesday, presidential spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said the Afghan government was concerned there would be dangerous consequences to the deal. \u201cWe therefore seek further clarifications about this document so that we can thoroughly assess potential threats and prevent them,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the explosion on Thursday, Ghani\u2019s running mate, Amrullah Saleh, said at a campaign rally in Kabul that \u201cthis is a conspiracy, it is not peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is aimed at the division of Afghanistan and we do not accept it,\u201d he said.\n\n[After Taliban bomb kills civilians, Afghans call for foreign compound to be closed]\n\nOn Monday, as Khalilzad appeared on Afghan television station ToloNews discussing the agreement, a massive bomb detonated in eastern Kabul, just outside a compound housing foreigners.\n\nThe Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed at least 16 people, including one Romanian diplomat and Afghan civilians, igniting anger in the neighborhood housing the compound, known as the Green Village, where Afghan residents have been killed in earlier attacks targeting foreigners.\n\nSharif Hassan contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Taliban decimated Afghanistan\u2019s film industry.
