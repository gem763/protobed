This is climate change, with all its effects on our planet, on the oceans, on the land surfaces, on the atmosphere which is really causing drastic changes to our planet.\n\nAnother question came from Aidin Hoomani, who wants to know how long it will be before the ice on the poles disappears?\n\n\"The ice caps are already melting,\" Aschbacher says. \"For example in the northern hemisphere, in the Arctic, you already get an ice-free north eastern passage in summer where ships can go from Europe to Asia. And it will happen that in a few decades you have completely ice-free poles, and by the end of the century it could well be that the northern pole has very little ice or no ice anymore.\"", "description": "#AskSpace: What causes climate change, and when will the ice caps melt?
