No due process now\n\n2. Maybe some later\n\n3. But only if they feel like it\n\n\u201cNo American, the president or anyone else, should be subjected to this kind of unfairness,\u201d he added:\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 impeachment resolution would just codify their unfair process.

The resolution gives authority to the House Intelligence Committee that it has never had before.\n\n2. The resolution does not provide the minority with equal subpoena power, as in the past.\n\n3. The resolution waters down minority powers over the release of Intelligence transcripts.\n\n4. The resolution does not compel the release of past testimony.\n\n5. The resolution restricts the president\u2019s right to be represented.\n\nThe White House responded to the House Democrats\u2019 resolution on Tuesday, calling it an \u201cillegitimate sham.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe resolution put forward by Speaker Pelosi confirms that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote,\u201d White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.", "description": "Mitch McConnell dismissed the Democrats' impeachment resolution, stating that it will do nothing more than \"codify their unfair process.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/mcconnell-dismissing-hand-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
