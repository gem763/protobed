In the interview, Clinton also said she believes Russia had compromising information, or kompromat, on Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary, and they\u2019re grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d the former secretary of state told David Plouffe in his \u201cCampaign HQ\u201d podcast without providing evidence.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d\n\nCardi B fears Trump will win in 2020: 'Nobody's saying they love a Democrat' Read more\n\nClinton, speaking on the podcast which first aired on Thursday, did not name Gabbard, but her comments appeared aimed at the Hawaii congresswoman.\n\nWhen asked if the former secretary of state was referring to Gabbard, Clinton\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cIf the nesting doll fits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not some outlandish claim,\u201d Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill added. \u201cThis is reality.\u201d\n\nGabbard later responded on Twitter, accusing Clinton of trying to destroy her reputation.\n\n\u201cGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain.\u201d\n\nTulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) ... powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.\n\nClinton also said she thought Jill Stein, the Green Party\u2019s 2016 presidential nominee, was a Russian asset: \u201cYeah, she\u2019s a Russian asset \u2013 I mean, totally. They know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate. So I don\u2019t know who it\u2019s going to be, but I will guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most needed.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Stein won more votes than Trump\u2019s margin of victory in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, three states that would have secured the presidency for Clinton had she won them.\n\nUS media analysis has shown that sites tied to Russia have celebrated Gabbard\u2019s campaign launch, defended her controversial 2017 meeting with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and attacked people who have suggested Gabbard is a pawn for Moscow.\n\nThere is a significant difference between being supported by Russian online bots and trolls, and \u201cgrooming\u201d, however.\n\nLast week, the New York Times quoted influential Republicans who said they were impressed with Gabbard\u2019s policy positions and energy. Far-right conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich said she \u201cseems very Trumpian\u201d.\n\nGabbard has rejected some of the support from rightwing or white nationalist sources, and during last week\u2019s Democratic debate she chastised the Times for publishing \u201csmears\u201d and said television commentators calling her a Russian asset were \u201ccompletely despicable\u201d.\n\nGabbard has said she would not launch an independent presidential bid if she lost the Democratic nomination.\n\nThe US intelligence community has concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in order to help boost the Republican Trump\u2019s chances of winning the presidency.\n\nClinton said it was clear Russia was laying the groundwork for similar interference in 2020, and that they will probably press for a third-party candidate to help divide America\u2019s electorate.\n\nPeople in Trump\u2019s orbit \u201cknow they can\u2019t win without a third party candidate\u201d, Clinton said.", "description": "Former secretary of state indicated in a podcast that the Hawaii congresswoman \u2018is a favorite of the Russians\u2019", "authors": ["Joan E Greve"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70e18e20e3e607b438cc3afab37d42a22491e756/0_153_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=757979d140bbb3977910030547ed66b4", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
