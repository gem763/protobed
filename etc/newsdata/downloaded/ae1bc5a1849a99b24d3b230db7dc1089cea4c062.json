Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) introduced the measure last year with the goal of giving graphic artists, photographers, and other content creators a more efficient pathway toward receiving damages if their works are infringed. Under current law, all copyright suits must go through the federal courts, a system that is often costly and time-consuming for creators who decide to litigate their cases.\n\nWith the CASE Act, Congress is hoping to streamline the process for both parties. If the measure were to become law, the Copyright Office would house a tribunal of \u201cCopyright Claims Officers\u201d who would work with both parties involved in a lawsuit to resolve infringement claims. As outlined in the bill, damages would be capped at $15,000 for each infringed work and top out at $30,000 total.\n\n\u201cThe internet has provided many benefits to society. It is a wonderful thing, but it cannot be allowed to function as if it is the Wild West with absolutely no rules,\u201d Jeffries told The Verge in an interview back in September. \u201cWe have seen that there are bad actors throughout society and the world who take advantage of the internet as a platform in a variety of ways. We cannot allow it.\u201d\n\nThe internet has made it easy for potential infringers to copy and paste creative works from artists, especially those whose businesses exist primarily online. However, internet advocacy and civil rights groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the American Civil Liberties Union have warned that a system like the one proposed by the CASE Act could cost the average internet user thousands for simply sharing a meme or lead to encroachments on their First Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cThe internet doesn\u2019t change the Constitution\u201d\n\n\u201cAny system to enable easier enforcement of copyrights runs the risk of creating a chilling effect with respect to speech online,\u201d the ACLU wrote in a letter to lawmakers on Monday urging them to oppose the measure. \u201cMany of these cases will be legitimate. However, some will not, and others, even if brought in good faith, may be defensible as fair use or for some other permissible reason.\u201d\n\nJeffries and others who support the bill argue that the small-claims tribunal is only an option and not a requirement for those who are looking to settle a copyright suit. Both parties need to agree to go forward in this way.\n\n\u201cThere is no gun that is being held to anyone\u2019s head, because the small claims court like tribunal is voluntary in nature,\u201d Jeffries told The Verge. \u201cAny argument made to the contrary, represents a deliberate attempt to misrepresent what\u2019s at stake as part of the effort to do away with the content copyright laws that have been part of the fabric of our democracy since the founding of the Republic and in fact the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe internet doesn\u2019t change the Constitution,\u201d Jeffries continued.\n\nSome organizations that oppose the bill, like the ACLU, agree that something should be done to fix a broken copyright system, but argue that previous changes like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) have been wrought with abuse. When someone receives a DMCA takedown, oftentimes they\u2019ll take down perfectly legal content protected under \u201cfair use\u201d entirely out of caution to avoid legal action.\n\nIn remarks made on the House floor Tuesday, Jeffries called the DMCA takedown system \u201cinefficient, cumbersome,\u201d and even \u201cpointless\u201d for content creators.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee has already voted the bill out of committee. It currently awaits a vote on the Senate floor.", "description": "The House of Representatives voted to approve a measure that would shake up the Copyright Office if it were made into law, creating a small claims court where online content creators can go after their infringers.", "authors": ["Makena Kelly", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOHOu941Eg-86YsQS28mVW30mCs=/0x411:5732x3412/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19310828/1073878196.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
