Well, welcome to the War on Children.\n\nIt\u2019s being waged by the Trump administration and other right-wing public officials, regardless of any claimed \u201cfamily values.\u201d\n\nFor evidence, look no further than the report released Wednesday by the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s own inspector general. It details the trauma suffered by immigrant children separated from their parents under the Trump administration\u2019s evil \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy.\n\nThousands of children were placed in overcrowded centers ill-equipped to provide care for them physically or psychologically. Visits to 45 centers around the country resulted in accounts of children who cried inconsolably; who were drugged; who were promised family reunifications that never came; whose severe emotional distress manifested in phantom chest pains, with complaints that \u201cevery heartbeat hurts\u201d; who thought their parents had abandoned them or had been murdered.\n\nSuch state-sanctioned child abuse was designed to serve as a \u201cdeterrent\u201d for asylum-seeking families, as then-Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and other administration officials made clear.\n\nOf course, they failed to recognize just how horrific are the conditions these asylum-seeking children are fleeing \u2014 conditions that further decreased HHS\u2019s ability to adequately care for them.\n\n\u201cStaff in multiple facilities reported cases of children who had been kidnapped or raped\u201d back in their home countries, the IG report states. Other children witnessed family members raped or murdered.\n\nBut hey, Trump believes these kiddos must be punished further for the crime of seeking refuge \u2014 a.k.a., the \u201cinvasion\u201d of America.\n\nDespite this and other abundant evidence that government facilities are not able to care for children for extended periods, last month, the administration also announced a new policy that would allow it to keep children (along with their families) in jail-like conditions for longer periods of time.\n\nThis is hardly the only way the administration has knowingly enacted policies that harm children.\n\nIn August, it finalized a rule that would make it more difficult for immigrants to receive green cards if they have used certain safety-net services they\u2019re legally entitled to \u2014 or if government officials suspect they might ever use such services. Confusion and fear about the policy and whom it affects abound. This has already created a \u201cchilling effect\u201d for usage of social services, with immigrant parents disenrolling even their U.S.-citizen children just to be safe.\n\nLast fall, for instance, I interviewed a green-card-holding mother who decided not to enroll her underweight newborn in a program that would have provided free formula (even though the program in question was not mentioned in the rule, and the baby is a U.S. citizen). Huge recent declines in children\u2019s Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program enrollment are also believed to be at least partly a result of fears about this policy change.\n\nAnd lest you think only immigrant or brown children are being targeted in this war: U.S. servicemembers\u2019 children, of all sorts of backgrounds, are being hurt, too.\n\nThe Trump administration is siphoning billions from various defense projects to fund border wall construction, despite promises that Mexico would pay for it. This might sound unlikely to affect kids, but somehow the Trump administration found a way. Among the projects losing funds are schools for the children of U.S. servicemembers based in Kentucky, Germany and Japan, and a child-care center at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposed federal budgets have likewise axed funding for other programs that serve children, such as subsidized school meals and Medicaid. Indeed, both federal and state GOP officials more broadly are still working to kill the Medi\u00adcaid expansion, as well as other Affordable Care Act provisions that benefit kids.\n\nThe GOP has likewise ignored the pleas of children who want their lives protected from gun violence, or who want their futures protected from a warming planet.\n\nA year ago, I offered a suggestion : that Democrats make children the theme of their midterm campaign. They mostly ignored me and still did okay. Nonetheless, I\u2019m re-upping it.\n\nBecause even without Trump\u2019s baby jails and proposed Medicaid cuts, our country\u2019s emphasis on children\u2019s well- being is seriously deficient.\n\nLast year, for the first time on record, we spent a greater share of the federal budget servicing the national debt than we did on children, according to an analysis out next week from First Focus on Children. Spending on children as a share of the federal budget is also expected to shrink over the coming decade, crowded out by both debt service and spending on the elderly.\n\nThis is despite the fact that spending on children (especially low-income children) has among the highest returns on investment of any form of government spending.\n\nWhatever the opposite of Trump\u2019s War on Children is, that\u2019s what Democrats should be running on.", "description": "Whatever the opposite of it is, that\u2019s what Democrats should be running on.", "authors": ["Catherine Rampell", "Columnist Covering Economics", "Public Policy", "Politics", "September At Pm", "Catherine Rampell Is An Opinion Columnist At The Washington Post.
