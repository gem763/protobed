On its surface, it\u2019s fairly innocuous, but it speaks to a larger theme: the Roys are constantly grappling with the concept of reality and their own connection to it \u2014 if, in fact, such a connection exists.\n\nIt makes sense, given the ivory tower in which Logan Roy raised his children. Their preposterous wealth has taught them that their world is a different one than the rest of ours; affections and allegiances can be bought, and the only thing that\u2019s \u201creal\u201d is their bottom line. It\u2019s why when Roman returns from his harrowing experience in the season finale, he\u2019s met not with sympathy or concern, but jokes. It\u2019s not until he reminds them that what happened to him was, you know, for real \u2014 \u201cIt was actually fucking scary, and we thought that they might kill us,\u201d he snaps \u2014 that they cease needling him and offer sympathy. To a Roy, the notion of one of their own being in actual, immediate bodily danger is a tough one to reckon with.\n\nLater, when the family discusses who will be sacrificed as the face of the cruise-department scandal, the proceeding has the same faux-reality tenor you\u2019d expect of Survivor or Big Brother. Everyone gathers around to deliberate over who should be eliminated, throwing each other under the bus with a detached insouciance, as it were all a game \u2026 rather than, you know, a real-life scenario in which someone\u2019s career and character will be irreparably destroyed. The setting \u2014 the dining room of one of Logan\u2019s comically large yachts \u2014 makes it all the more absurd; how can anyone really be in trouble while sipping ros\u00e9 in boat shoes?\n\nOf course, anyone at Waystar who\u2019s not a Roy is deemed expendable by the family \u2014 even Siobhan\u2019s husband Tom, who barely escapes becoming the scapegoat. When Roman starts taking bets on which executive will be thrown to the wolves, he\u2019s reminded by Karl that \u201cWe are real people.\u201d \u201cYou are not,\u201d the youngest Roy responds. \u201cYou claim to be real, but look at you. Look at you.\u201d\n\nOf course, the concept of \u201creal people\u201d had reared its ugly head throughout the season, most significantly as part of the cruises scandal, where the callous \u201cNo RPI\u201d (as in \u201cno real persons involved\u201d) was used to indicate cases where the victims were migrant workers, sex workers or other people deemed insignificant. Logan trots it out again during the season\u2019s penultimate scene, when he applies it to the waiter Kendall left for dead in a Ted Kennedy-esque car crash in the UK. Despite having visited the boy\u2019s home, talking to his grieving parents and seeing the family photos on the wall, Logan Roy regards the waiter as someone not quite valid enough to be considered a \u201creal person.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s in this moment \u2014 and an earlier one, in which Logan admits he never seriously considered making Kendall CEO because he\u2019s \u201cnot a killer\u201d (despite the fact that Kendall did technically kill a guy) \u2014 that something turns in Logan\u2019s eldest son. The wool is lifted from his eyes, and he\u2019s able to defy his family\u2019s ambiguous sense of reality: all people are real, and Logan Roy is not untouchable. He doles out a Judas kiss and sets off to betray his father.\n\nOr \u2026 does he? Was that sly look from Logan as his son twisted the metaphorical knife in his back supposed to mean he (i.e., Logan) was in on this the whole time? That he knew he had to be the one to go, but his family would never accept it, so he manipulated Kendall into taking him out? In its brilliant finale, was Succession cajoling us, the audience, into wondering \u201cIs this real?\u201d right alongside the Roys?\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait until Season 3 to find out.", "description": "There were far more memorable lines in Succession's second season (\"You can't make a Tomlette without breaking some Greggs,\" for example, or anything from", "authors": ["Bonnie Stiernberg"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/succession_s02e10_still_2-e1571069461796.jpg?fit=645%2C430", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
