Beijing agreed to exempt some animal-feed products, such as fish meal, from retaliatory tariffs. (Str/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nChina extended an olive twig, rather than a branch, to the United States in their trade war Wednesday, announcing it would exempt 16 American-made products from tariffs as a sign of goodwill ahead of talks scheduled for next month.\n\nBut the gesture, which Beijing said was designed to ease the dispute\u2019s impact on American companies, does not offer relief from tariffs on the big-ticket agricultural products such as soybeans and corn that are causing the most hurt in the United States.\n\n\u201cChina wants to claim the moral high ground before the October talks and to send a message of goodwill,\u201d said Yao Xinchao, professor of international trade at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. \u201cIt\u2019s all about molding public opinion\u201d to portray the United States as the aggressor, Yao added.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Finance said that 16 types of U.S. products would be exempt from retaliatory tariffs for a year from next Tuesday. The list included varieties of animal feed such as alfalfa and fish meal, cancer drugs gefitinib and capecitabine, base oil for lubricants and lubricating grease, and some farm chemicals.\n\nFurther exemptions will be announced in the coming weeks, the ministry said, and tariffs that have been imposed will be refunded.\n\n\u201cThe purpose is to minimize the impact of economic and trade frictions on Chinese enterprises, and to shows China\u2019s consistent calmness and rationality in dealing with these frictions,\u201d the state news agency, Xinhua, wrote in a commentary published Wednesday evening. It characterized China as \u201chighly responsible.\u201d\n\nBut the list offers no respite for American farmers affected by Chinese tariffs on produce including corn, soybeans and pork. Exports of American agricultural products have been hit especially hard in the trade war \u2014 the Chinese duty on American pork now sits at 72 percent \u2014 leading the Trump administration to offer compensation to American farmers to the tune of $28 billion.\n\nChina knows that this represents a point of leverage: the trade war is playing out in the American heartland ahead of an election year.\n\n\u201cPork and soybeans are two important bargaining chips that China won\u2019t play easily,\u201d said Yao.\n\n[Markets soar as China, U.S. resume trade talks in Washington in October]\n\nWednesday\u2019s measures marked the first time in the dispute that tariffs have been removed, not added.\n\n\u201cI think both sides want a deal,\u201d said Kent Kedl, a China analyst at the Control Risks consultancy. \u201cSo I think they\u2019re trying to feel their way around and find out what might break the stalemate. China is speaking the language of the Trump administration here: tariffs.\u201d\n\nChina and the United States have been involved in a tit-for-tat tariff battle, imposing rounds of duties on each other\u2019s products for more than a year.\n\nPresident Trump has hoped that the tariffs would convince China to cave in to his demands to rebalance the trading relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies. But Beijing has retaliated as much as it can \u2014 China exports far more to the United States than it imports \u2014 and has insisted any deal must be \u201cmutually beneficial.\u201d\n\nIn the latest episode, the Trump administration declared it would add a 15 percent tax to consumer products from China, including clothing, footwear, pens, pencils, diapers, Bluetooth ear buds, televisions, golf clubs and fishing line. Those tariffs took effect Sept. 1.\n\nAt one point, Trump even ordered American companies to prepare to leave China.\n\nThe trade war is taking its toll on the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nThe growth rate in China has slowed to its weakest level in 30 years, and although this is mostly due to domestic factors, the trade war is certainly not helping.\n\nImports of American goods to China fell by 22 percent in August compared with a year earlier, according to Chinese customs data published Sunday. Meanwhile, the value of Chinese exports to the United States fell by 16 percent.\n\nBy the same token, the U.S. economy is also showing some signs of weakness, as the Federal Reserve highlighted in July when it cut interest rates. Surveys have shown cause for concern about the U.S. manufacturing sector in particular.\n\n[New tariffs on shoes, televisions and other Chinese-made products take effect Sunday ]\n\nBut efforts to broker a deal to end the trade war have repeatedly failed, with China balking at what it considers American micromanagement \u2014 requiring legal changes that it says are unnecessary \u2014 while the United States remains skeptical that China will embark on the kinds of structural changes it says are needed.\n\nAmerican negotiators have been pushing China to do more to protect intellectual property rights and stop Chinese companies from forcing American partners to hand over technology as the price of market entry. They also want China to create a more level playing field by limiting its support for state-owned enterprises.\n\nTrump has been particularly concerned about the trade deficit with China \u2014 which widened to $419 billion last year \u2014 and has been pressing Beijing to buy more from the United States as a way to close that gap.\n\nIn the latest effort to find a solution, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said last week that Liu He, the vice premier who has been leading the trade negotiations from the Chinese side, would travel to Washington in early October for a new round of talks aimed at breaking the impasse.\n\nThis will be the 13th round of talks between Liu and his American counterpart, U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer.\n\nAndrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research in Hong Kong, said that China appeared to be sending a signal to Trump to get the talks moving forward.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like they scrambled at the last minute to put together a list of tariffed items that wouldn\u2019t significantly change their negotiating stance but would at least show they were willing to compromise,\u201d Collier said. \u201cIt\u2019s very much an improvised strategy.\u201d\n\nBut the biggest challenge, said Kedl of Control Risks, will be getting to a position where the two sides can trust each other again.\n\n\u201cThey need to be able to look each other in the eye and know that 48 hours later, they will still be in agreement,\u201d he said, referring to some of the previous U-turns in the talks.\n\n[China loves its pork, but prices are rising and that could be a problem ]\n\nBusinesses on both sides are eager for an end to the protracted war and the uncertainty that it has injected into the trading relationship.\n\nA U.S. Chamber of Commerce delegation led by Executive Vice President Myron Brilliant has been in Beijing this week holding talks with senior Chinese leaders, including Premier Li Keqiang. The tariff dispute has dragged down economic growth and business confidence, Brilliant said after meeting with Li.\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty produced by U.S.-China trade tensions is exerting significant downward pressure on both economies,\u201d Brilliant said in a statement. \u201cThe time is now to strike a deal that addresses the U.S.\u2019s legitimate concerns about market access, forced technology transfer, subsidies, and digital trade, while concurrently removing punitive and retaliatory tariffs.\u201d\n\nLi, for his part, said the two sides should seek common ground based on the principle of equality and mutual respect, according to a report from China\u2019s state-run Xinhua news agency.\n\nWang Yuan contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nA year into the trade war, China learns to ride out Trump\u2019s turbulence\n\nTrump admits his trade war is hurting the stock market\n\nShoves, brawls and shouts: Welcome to Costco\u2019s opening day in China\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The move is a gesture of goodwill before trade talks resume next month, analysts say.", "authors": ["Anna Fifield", "Beijing Bureau Chief.", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/g2BdQkVc6ViqnZ3ruqEYLkGt3KY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KTQZJ4GUOAI6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
