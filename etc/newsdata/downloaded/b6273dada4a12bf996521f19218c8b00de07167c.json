Lam said the new regulation, to take effect Saturday, is a \"prohibition of the face covering\" and is intended to \"target rioters or those that resort to violence.\"\n\nFollowing the announcement, thousands of demonstrators gathered in the city's central business district and other areas, shouting \"Hong Kong people, resist!'' Groups of angry protesters attacked pro-Chinese businesses, vandalized subway stops, and set street fires, causing police to respond with tear gas fire.\n\nPolice said an officer fired a live shot in self-defense after he was attacked by protesters in the northern Yuen Long district.\n\nMore rallies are expected over the weekend.\n\n", "description": "Hong Kong Residents Protest Government Ban on Masks", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/05/2019100500349_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
