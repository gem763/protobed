Photo: Amazon Studios\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a time when I\u2019ve visited my parents\u2019 home and there hasn\u2019t been the offer of fruit \u2014 cut fruit, specifically, leading me to wonder if there was ever a time when the fruit wasn\u2019t cut. If, perhaps, it just sprouts forth from the land, perfectly sliced.\n\nCut fruit fulfills the following Jewish-mother rules: One must always have something to nosh on (as one is always hungry); it should be a healthy snack; but would it kill us to make it a little sweet, too?\n\nIt takes nearly 19 minutes for Shelly Pfefferman to show up onscreen in the Transparent pilot, with a sensible, short gray haircut, offering to cut some cantaloupe for her daughter, Ali. The scene lasts less than two minutes. This is how we will see Shelly for most of the first season: on the fringes, Jewish-mothering, or at least performing the tasks of a Jewish mother. It is just one of many perfect, character-defining details that made Shelly familiar to me, and my favorite character on the show.\n\nI loved all the Shellyness, the nitty-gritty details that form this variation on the archetype \u2014 particularly in the first season. The way she calls her children, at various times, \u201cDolly.\u201d (I have a second cousin who used to do that, and I heard her voice every time Shelly said it.) She\u2019s a nicknamer, a pincher, a squisher, and a noodge, too. She frets over how other Jews might judge her actions or lifestyle. When her husband, Ed, disappears during episode five, she is less worried about finding him than seeming like she isn\u2019t worried, at least in the eyes of the soon-to-be-visiting rabbi: \u201cI\u2019ll be the talk of the temple, the lady who lost her husband.\u201d When 13-year-old Ali cancels her bat mitzvah in an episode-eight flashback, she says, \u201cThanks to Ali, I can\u2019t go to the village. If I do, I\u2019m going to run into somebody and then I\u2019m going to have explain and explain and explain.\u201d\n\nHer complex relationship with food, too, made me want to spend more time with her as a character. She eats with a wild focus \u2014 either consuming with abandon or pushing her food off her plate. She has a standing order at Canter\u2019s Deli and can tell simply by holding the bags that the order is off. (Ali goes dairy-free for an episode and ordered tofu spread instead.) There\u2019s the bulk-size jar of mustard she carries to Ed\u2019s shiva \u2014 to the annoyance of her other daughter, Sarah \u2014 just in case more mustard might be needed. To control food is to control life \u2014 not just hers, but those around her, too.\n\nWhat is more elusive with Shelly \u2014 in spite of Judith Light\u2019s nuanced, tender, and funny performance of a character written extremely loud \u2014 is a deeper understanding of her. At times I felt she was slighted, or made to play the clown in the Pfeffermans\u2019 universe. She is given far less screen time than her family members in the first two seasons, disappearing for entire episodes. She often exists to elicit a response from a family member, frame a scene, or provide background information. And she is allowed little desire, even as the rest of her family is granted a multitude of sexual explorations over the course of four seasons. When she climaxes in a bathtub in season two, as Maura pleasures her with her hand, it feels shocking, because heretofore her sexuality has been barely addressed. Yet that moment is focused more on Maura feeling obligated to Shelly\u2019s libido, even slightly resenting it by the end. The scene tracks Maura in the mirror, looking at herself, knowing that she is over this dynamic. We know how Shelly\u2019s body reacts \u2014 she has an orgasm, a big one \u2014 but we know how Maura feels.\n\nI wondered at times if she was less interesting to the show\u2019s creators because she had, compared to the rest of her family, such conventional notions of happiness. (What\u2019s so interesting about a Jewish mother, anyway? Everything, I say.) She tells her son, Josh, that she wants him to be more present in her life early in season one. She spits, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to call me, I want you to be here.\u201d But as I saw Shelly, she had just as far to go and grow as anyone else.\n\nI want for her what I want for every Jewish mother of a certain generation who was raised to abide by a certain set of rules. I want her to fly.\n\nShelly is given more agency when her boyfriend Buzz shows up toward the end of season two. Ponytailed, easygoing Buzz perhaps feels to Shelly like her last chance at happiness. What she has been taught \u2014 generationally, culturally \u2014 is to pair up, to be a part of a couple, and to surround yourself with family. For 13 episodes, they are happy together: He encourages her creatively, plans cruises for her family, and delights in pleasing her. That he is spending all her money and is kind of a con artist is a depressing reveal.\n\nBut I felt like I knew Shelly best in the scene where she discovers his betrayal. When Buzz invents a dead wife from his past, there\u2019s a flicker in her eyes, a slight frown on her lips; her eyes gaze off as she does the math, registers disgust, and then resolves it. \u201cWe\u2019re done, Buzzy,\u201d she says with a dismissive hand and a wry laugh. \u201cI could accept you being broke, I could accept you being in debt to the U.S. government, but what I will not accept is being lied to. Never again.\u201d The camera finally stays on her for a nice long stretch. We see multitudes.\n\nStill, throughout the third season, she remains comic fodder, particularly in the subplot involving her one-woman show, \u201cTo Shel and Back,\u201d presented as part of the prestigious \u201cTemple Talk\u201d series at her shul. \u201cI have started to live the truth of my existence,\u201d she says. \u201cTo really open up for the first time in my life.\u201d And I want that for her, desperately \u2014 for her to emerge. I want for her what I want for every Jewish mother of a certain generation who was raised to abide by a certain set of rules. I want her to fly.\n\nA few episodes later, though, her evolution is treated again as a joke, when she announces at Maura\u2019s birthday party, \u201cI have transitioned too, I\u2019m coming out, I\u2019m reaching out. I\u2019m a brand!\u201d It feels like a cruel bit of mockery. By the fourth season, when she begins an improv class, I thought: Enough already.\n\nI always return to where I would have been fine with Transparent ending forever, at least when it comes to Shelly: the finale of season three. The Pfeffermans take the family cruise together, minus Buzz, and everyone treats Shelly like shit. She throws together a last-minute rendition of her one-woman show and finally has a moment of triumph, a moment to breathe: a stunning rendition of \u201cOne Hand in My Pocket.\u201d Her wig taut and makeup subdued, she glitters in a jeweled jacket. There\u2019s a hint of Carole Channing in her voice. Light\u2019s graceful bones are perfectly lit. It\u2019s a thoughtful, emotive performance, sincere as hell, but with panache, while her children watch first in fear and then delight. The scene is all hers, and what a relief it is for all of us.\n\nAt the end of season four, Shelly takes her maiden name back. She\u2019s had a heavy-handed season, finally revealing her own childhood molestation to her family. Marriage and children had worn her down in her life \u2014 a feeling she\u2019d expressed a few times over the course of the show. (Understandable with these kids, with that husband, with this world.) Now she\u2019ll be a Lipkind again. She reclaims the version of Shelly \u201cthat was the last time I was truly myself,\u201d she says. It gives me hope for her future and for the final, musical episode of the show. I still occasionally replay that scene of her singing \u201cOne Hand in My Pocket,\u201d when she\u2019s no longer just the mother or the wife. Who could she be if given half a shot? She\u2019ll be fine, fine, fine.", "description": "In praise of Shelly Pfefferman, the mother on the Amazon TV series Transparent, played by Judith Light.", "authors": ["Jami Attenberg"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/26/transparent/26-transparent-shelly-jewish-mom.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
