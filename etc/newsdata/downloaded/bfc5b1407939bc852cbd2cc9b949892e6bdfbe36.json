According to court records, Hamilton's ex-wife sought a protective order earlier this month to prohibit contact with one of his daughters. It was later expanded to any child under age 17.\n\nHamilton, 38, was the No. 1 overall draft pick of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 1999, but substance abuse issues delayed his MLB debut until the 2007 season. The following year he was traded to Texas, where he was a five-time All-Star in addition to winning the 2010 AL MVP award.", "description": "Former American League MVP Josh Hamilton turned himself in on Wednesday in Fort Worth, Texas.
