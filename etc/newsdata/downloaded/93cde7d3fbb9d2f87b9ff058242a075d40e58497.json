Meanwhile, imports from the US slumped 22.4%.\n\nThere were escalations in August in the year-long trade row, with Washington announcing 15% tariffs on a wide range of Chinese goods from September.\n\nChina hit back with levies of its own, and let its yuan currency fall to offset some of the tariff pressures.\n\nOn Friday, China's central bank cut banks' reserve requirements for a seventh time since early 2018 to free up more funds for lending.\n\nAnalyst expectations had been that a falling yuan would offset some cost pressures.\n\nChina let its currency slide past the key 7-per-dollar level in August for the first time since the global financial crisis.\n\nThat led Washington to dub Beijing \"a currency manipulator\".\n\n\"Exports are still weak even in the face of substantial yuan currency depreciation, indicating that sluggish external demand is the most important factor affecting exports this year,\" said Zhang Yi, economist at Zhong Hai Sheng Rong Capital Management.\n\nFresh talks\n\nMany analysts expect export growth to slow further in coming months, with more US tariff measures due to take effect on 1 October and 15 December.\n\nChinese exports to Europe, South Korea, Australia, and South East Asia also worsened on an annual basis, compared with July.\n\nBut exports to Japan and Taiwan were slightly better than the previous month.\n\nOn Thursday, China and the US agreed to renew trade talks in October in Washington, the first since a failed US-China trade meeting in July.", "description": "The latest China trade data points to further signs of strain in the world's second largest economy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12C68/production/_105940967_shippingchina.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
