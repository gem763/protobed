No shooter or victims were found. (Photo by Clarence Williams/TWP)\n\nPanic broke out Saturday night in the Ballston area of Arlington, Va., as reports of an active shooter spread. But hours later, it was not clear whether a threat ever existed.\n\nPolice said they were sent at 8:42 p.m. to the Ballston Quarter mall in response to a possible shooting in a movie theater. But by about 9:30 p.m., they said, they finished their search of the theater and \u201cno evidence of a shooting has been located.\u201d\n\nNor, officials said, did they find evidence of victims after an hours-long search.\n\nFinally, shortly after midnight Sunday, police said the mall garage was being reopened, giving patrons access to their vehicles. In addition, police said, those who left the food hall without their property could get it outside True Food Kitchen.\n\nAlthough no shooting victims were found, a police spokeswoman said one person suffered a minor injury, apparently during the effort to \u201cself-evacuate.\u201d The injury was to be treated at a hospital, officials said.\n\nFor a time Saturday night, theater patrons were asked to \u201cshelter in place\u201d while a search went on, according to the police.\n\n\n\nReports of a possible active shooter at a major dining, shopping and entertainment venue in Arlington, Va. sent police flooding into the area. As of late Saturday night, no shooter or victims had been found. (Photo by Clarence Williams/TWP)\n\nAs of late Saturday night, it remained unclear what prompted the initial reports of gunfire. Police said they would try to learn that in the course of their investigation.\n\nWhatever their source, the reports of someone with a gun, or of a shooting, sent people fleeing or got them escorted from stores and restaurants in the center, a shopping, dining and entertainment mall.\n\nA group of students from Arlington's Yorktown High School watched the first few minutes of a movie at a mall theater until the screen went dark.\n\n\"We thought it was part of the movie,\" said Colby Distasio, a junior at Yorktown.\n\nThen, he said, \"the cops came and made us walk out with our hands up.\"\n\nJacquelyn Ward said she was dining at a bar when she noticed people racing toward the exits. An employee started to shout that someone was shooting, and screams broke out, she added.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the restaurant started running,\u201d Ward said, \u201ceven the bartenders.\u201d\n\nAnother witness to the night\u2019s sudden clamor, Christine Hollins, said she was working in the Macy\u2019s when a manager told customers and employees that they needed to evacuate.\n\nShe said that the departures seemed orderly but that she \u201cdefinitely saw people running.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen somebody says something about gunshots, I said: \u2018Let me get my purse and get out of here,\u2019\u201d she added.\n\nThe mall is near N. Glebe Road and Wilson Boulevard, a main commercial intersection in North Arlington. Arlington is a Northern Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Police arrived but said it remained unclear what prompted reports of a threat.", "authors": ["Clarence Williams", "Local Reporter Covering Crime", "Breaking News", "Public Safety Issues", "Martin Weil", "Local Reporter", "Patricia Sullivan", "Reporter Covering Government", "Politics", "Other Regional Issues In Arlington County"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1AuiJyyn_wAKbmcHDPp0KezXaSs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P6BP7OVHAII6RLLPBADXBXG5YI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
