REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian\n\nThe South American country\u2019s leader for eight years until 2015, \u201cCristina\u201d, as she is known to fans, returns to the Casa Rosada palace after she and senior running mate Alberto Fernandez scored a decisive victory in Sunday\u2019s election.\n\nThe return of the fiery Fernandez de Kirchner is a major twist in Argentine politics, turning Latin America\u2019s third-largest economy abruptly back towards the left after four years under conservative leader Mauricio Macri.\n\nDressed in a flowing red outfit and appearing as natural as ever on stage after the victory, Cristina made an impassioned plea for every effort by Macri to stabilize the economy until he leaves office.\n\n\u201cPlease.. take all the measures you should take to lighten the dramatic situation that is being experienced in the country\u2019s finances. It is your responsibility,\u201d she said, before handing the microphone to Alberto Fernandez.\n\nShe later posed for selfies on her way out of the arena, as supporters angled to get near her.\n\nBy far the biggest name in Argentina\u2019s Peronist movement, she stunned everyone in May by announcing she would run as the No. 2 on the presidential ticket of her former chief of staff, amid concerns her divisive image would drive away key centrist voters.\n\nA political powerhouse for more than two decades, her star rose as Argentina\u2019s charismatic first lady during the 2003-2007 presidency of her husband, Nestor Kirchner, whom she succeeded, and who died in 2010.\n\nHer second term ended in 2015, amid accusations by critics she was a authoritarian populist who had bankrupted Argentina\u2019s economy with welfare spending and graft. She still faces a series of legal cases over graft accusations, which she denies.\n\nShe famously refused to attend Macri\u2019s inauguration and hand over the presidential baton and sash after the two clashed over where the ceremony should take place.\n\nThe surprise tactic of taking the deputy role has worked. Fernandez\u2019s star power added glamor to the low-key Peronist ticket and helped tap into popular anger with Macri\u2019s administration, as high inflation and an anemic economy have pushed many Argentines into poverty.\n\nNow voters and investors are bracing for Cristina\u2019s return. Many believe she will have significant sway behind the scenes, though her party has played this down.\n\n\u201cThis is Cristina. It\u2019s unrealistic to expect her to be invisible for long,\u201d said Benjamin Gedan, director of the Wilson Center\u2019s Argentina Project in Washington.\n\n\u201cBased on everything we know about her history and personality, she is likely to want to be a major figure in Argentine politics once again.\u201d\n\nCUSHIONED BY MODERATE PRESIDENT?\n\nDuring the campaign she kept to the sidelines, instead promoting her memoir \u201cSincerely\u201d on a book tour that drew huge crowds. Her Twitter feed, normally inflammatory and quick to jab at opponents, has been muted.\n\nInvestors said they hoped her role would be cushioned with more moderate Alberto Fernandez as president.\n\nBut some are holding their breath to see if she will assume greater prominence in the new government, said Ilya Gofshteyn, a senior emerging markets strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York.\n\nInvestors haven\u2019t forgotten Argentina\u2019s economic woes under Cristina, when a row with bondholders eventually forced the country into technical default in 2014, but have listened to Alberto Fernandez\u2019s subtle signals about a more moderate tack.\n\n\u201cMarkets, for the most part, are willing to give the Fernandez ticket the benefit of the doubt,\u201d said Gofshteyn, adding people hoped that \u201cCristina is not going to be the one in the driver\u2019s seat\u201d.\n\nHe added, \u201cBut, longer term, that is absolutely the threat hanging over the Argentine political system.\u201d\n\nThe ex-president is loved and hated in almost equal measure by voters too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m terrified of the Fernandezes,\u201d said Marissa Misischia, 52, a psychologist, as she went to vote for Macri in Buenos Aires on Sunday, referring to the running mates who share a name but are unrelated. \u201cCristina destroyed the economy in the past.\u201d\n\nCarlos Berenguer, a 71-year-old retiree, on his way out of the polls in Buenos Aires, said he hoped Cristina would set the tone for the new government.\n\n\u201cI prefer that Cristina has more leadership experience,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that she is an educated, righteous and intelligent person.\u201d\n\nCristina was loved by Argentina\u2019s poor, many of whom credit her policies with helping to lift them from poverty, though her administration did not publish regular poverty statistics. Under Macri, the poverty rate has shot up to 35% as Argentines struggle to make ends meet, government data shows.\n\nAlberto Fernandez is inheriting a weakened economy and depleted central bank reserves, yet a voter base that is eager for a return to the generous social subsidies under Fernandez de Kirchner\u2019s government.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThat could be a recipe for tension.\n\nArgentine political analyst Facundo Nejamkis said that while there was support for Cristina amongst hardcore Peronists, most were resigned to Alberto Fernandez\u2019s more centrist route, though if things went badly that could change.\n\n\u201cOf course, if Alberto Fernandez doesn\u2019t do well, then it may be that voters demand Cristina take on a bigger role.\u201d", "description": "Argentina's former president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, a rockstar politician adored by the poor but feared by big business and investors, is back, although as vice president this time.", "authors": ["Cassandra Garrison", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445708141&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R06I", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
