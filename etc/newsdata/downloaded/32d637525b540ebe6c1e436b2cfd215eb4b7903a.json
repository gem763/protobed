He holds an interim title, tasked with organizing free and fair elections, as per the Venezuelan constitution. Maduro has refused to give up his position, however, and retains control of the nation\u2019s military, making it almost impossible for Guaid\u00f3 to exercise any of his powers. The fact that Maduro refused to step down after his term ended allowed the nation\u2019s legislature to constitutionally appoint a president to replace him.\n\nDespite this, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s administration has established formal diplomatic relations with over 50 countries, including most in the Western Hemisphere. The United States expelled Maduro\u2019s envoys from the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington and have given control over to Guaid\u00f3\u2019s ambassador, Carlos Vecchio.\n\n\u201cWe have formed a delegation that will represent our government and all Venezuelans next week before the 74th General Assembly of the United Nations,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 announced Sunday on Twitter. \u201cThis delegation has a mandate to construct agreements with the principal leaders of the world to increase the pressure against the dictatorship and support the people of Venezuela before the grave crisis our country is facing.\u201d\n\nAs the delegation will not legally be allowed to participate in the U.N. General Assembly, Guaid\u00f3 listed the engagements that the group will partake in, including a meeting with the \u201cLima Group,\u201d a Latin American coalition against Maduro; bilateral meetings with friendly states (presumably the United States among them), and \u201cworking group\u201d meetings on specific problems facing Venezuela, including its migrant crisis and the gross human rights violations by the Maduro regime.\n\nLa delegaci\u00f3n enviada a Naciones Unidas estar\u00e1 encabezada por el Comisionado para Relaciones Exteriores @JulioBorges; y participar\u00e1n tambi\u00e9n el Embajador ante los EE.UU @carlosvecchio y el Comisionado para la Ayuda Humanitaria @Miguel_Pizarro, as\u00ed como diputados y v\u00edctimas. \u2014 Juan Guaid\u00f3 (@jguaido) September 22, 2019\n\nThe United Nations has soundly rejected Guaid\u00f3\u2019s call to put pressure on Maduro to step down and allow for the country to return to its democratic tradition. Maduro\u2019s regime served on the U.N. Human Rights Council until completing its term this year, represented by Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza. The U.N. invited Maduro to speak at this year\u2019s General Assembly and dismissed the possibility of yielding to the international consensus that Guaid\u00f3 is the nation\u2019s president, based on the Venezuelan constitution.\n\nAsked this month if Guaid\u00f3 would be invited to the General Assembly, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres flatly rejected the idea. Guterres instead told reporters that the United Nations kept \u201cregular contact\u201d with Guaid\u00f3\u2019s team, which he referred to as \u201cthe opposition,\u201d despite being the legal executive administration of the country.\n\nMaduro rejected Guterres\u2019s invitation to speak at the General Assembly this year, failing to repeat on his appearance in 2018.\n\n\u201cI went to New York last year, this year I am not going, this year I am staying here with you working in Venezuela,\u201d Maduro said last week, amid rumors that he fears leaving Venezuela and having his top military leaders stage a coup against him. Maduro is planning to send Arreaza and Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez. Maduro ordered the two to hand to Guterres a petition allegedly signed by millions of Venezuelans \u2013 at the threat of losing their jobs, not receiving government food rations, or worse \u2013 condemning American President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe Venezuelan people say no more embargo, no more sanctions, no more aggression from the empire [America],\u201d Maduro denounced last week.\n\nArreaza posted a message on Twitter Sunday vowing that, while at the United Nations, he would discuss \u201cclimate change, poverty reduction, and educational inclusivity.\u201d In a statement on the official foreign ministry website, the Maduro regime claimed that the United States was \u201cresponsible for the largest part of the accelerated deterioration of the environment and of natural phenomena\u201d and that Venezuela would participate in shaming Washington for this. The statement did not mention China, a longtime Maduro ally and the world\u2019s most prolific polluter.\n\nThe Maduro regime is responsible for some of the most devastating economic damage in South America. As oil production has plummeted \u2013 a product of the Maduro and prior Hugo Ch\u00e1vez regimes nationalizing the industry \u2013 Maduro has had to increasingly rely on gold as a currency to continue paying for the lavish lifestyles of himself and those around him. To keep gold supplies afloat, Maduro has encouraged a sprawling illegal mining industry in the Amazon rainforest, controlled by Marxist terrorist organizations affiliated with the regime.\n\nThe Maduro regime has also had few answers to the growing garbage crisis in Caracas. Maduro\u2019s government has failed to routinely dispose of garbage in Caracas for years, leaving feet-tall piles of trash lining the streets throughout the city. Many Venezuelans feed off the few bits of food they can find in the garbage, but the prevalence of waste lining the streets of a tropical city has created a significant medical crisis as insects and bacteria thrive, especially given the near-total lack of medicine in the country.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Venezuelan President Juan Guaid\u00f3 announced Sunday he will send a delegation to the United Nations General Assembly despite not being invited.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1169577980-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
