That to me is really damning to everybody else, because no one else gets a chance because he\u2019s thinking that the whites are superior. Period.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cPresident Trump is a rich guy who is mired in white privilege to the extreme. Republicans are too sheepish to call him out on anything and they are afraid of losing their positions and losing any power themselves.\u201d\n\nHe accused the Republican party of following a \u201cpro-white\u201d agenda and using black people as \u201cpolitical pawns\u201d.\n\nRecalling to PBS the moment Trump pointed at him at the rally in Redding, and said, \u201cLook at my African American over here! Look at him! Are you the greatest?!\u201d Cheadle said he saw it as a joke at the time, but now he sees it differently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more critical of it today than I was back then because today I wonder to what extent he said that for political gain or for attention.\u201d", "description": "Gregory Cheadle, who was singled out by Trump at California rally in 2016, quits Republican party and says president \u2018mired in white privilege\u2019", "authors": ["Miranda Bryant"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1add9df082d6363d917dbe461dc6f5dafb971dc0/0_55_2650_1590/master/2650.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=33479784863dbfc268e880e40173527b"}
