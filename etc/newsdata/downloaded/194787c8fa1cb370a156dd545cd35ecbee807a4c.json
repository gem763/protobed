Australia and Scotland picked up routine wins against Tier 2 opposition while Argentina finished their disappointing campaign by beating the United States.\n\nHere, Sportsmail sifts through the wreckage of those 10 contests and selects its team of week three from the Rugby World Cup.\n\n15 Liam Williams (Wales)\n\nIn a chaotic, seven-try thriller which saw Wales come back from a 10-0 early deficit amid four yellow cards being dished out, Williams was a sea of calm at the back of the field. Showed flashes of his usual brilliance with the ball in hand too and helped himself to the final try. Just edges out England's Elliot Daly.\n\nLiam Williams dives over to score Wales' fourth try in their thrilling win over Fiji\n\n14 Cheslin Kolbe (South Africa)\n\nSimply the best wing in the world right now. Two tries and 224 metres made over 15 carries - and he even chipped in with 11 tackles in the win over Italy. Probably the star of the tournament so far.\n\nCheslin Kolbe continued his electric start to the World Cup with two tries against Italy\n\n13 Tevita Kuridrani (Australia)\n\nStaked his claim for a regular starting berth with a barnstorming display in the win over Uruguay, helping himself to two tries. The problem is, can he and Samu Kerevi play together? Probably not.\n\nTevita Kuridrani staked his claim for a regular starting spot in Australia's win over Uruguay\n\n12 Anton Lienert-Brown (New Zealand)\n\nShifted in one from his usual position at No 13, Lienert-Brown confirmed he is the in-form All Black centre right now, putting his name ahead of Ryan Crotty, Sonny Bill Williams and Jack Goodhue in the pecking order. So elusive and a brilliant passer, Lienert-Brown scored two tries in the win over Namibia.\n\nAnton Lienert-Brown was at his slaloming best in the centres for New Zealand\n\n11 Semi Radradra (Fiji)\n\nThat he keeps out Welsh opponent Josh Adams, who scored a well-taken hat-trick, says it all. Rightly earned man of the match in a losing effort with a jaw-dropping display of running, beating seven defenders and making 140 metres in his 19 carries despite not scoring a try. Like Kolbe, a second entry in our team of the week.\n\nSemi Radradra picked up the man of the match award against Wales for an all-action display\n\n10 George Ford (England)\n\nMuch has been made of the fact that Owen Farrell has had a quiet tournament so far but the fact is he has not been needed as much with Ford running the show inside him. There are few better fly-halves in the world with front-foot ball and that's exactly what England had against Argentina as Ford dictated and created, scoring a try too.\n\nGeorge Ford breaks through a couple of Argentinian tackles to score a try\n\n9 Cobus Reinach (South Africa)\n\nScorer of the earliest hat-trick in World Cup history, going over three times inside 20 minutes against Canada. One of those was a near length-of-the-field try where he showcased the electric pace that Northampton fans are used to seeing. Hard to believe he's only third choice for the Springboks.\n\nCobus Reinach gallops home to score his third try inside 20 minutes against Canada\n\n1 Joe Marler (England)\n\nAfter an even start against Argentina, England wrestled the initiative at the scrum and eventually began to dominate, providing quick ball for the backs to weave their magic. Marler lacks the ball-carrying ability of Mako Vunipola but is as good if not better than him in every other area.\n\nJoe Marler has been solid for England so far and could keep out Mako Vunipola in the last eight\n\n2 Mbongeni Mbonambi (South Africa)\n\nAppears to have usurped Malcolm Marx as the Springboks' first-choice hooker having started the World Cup in outstanding form. Solid at the set-piece and in mauls and was a rampaging presence with ball in hand against Italy.\n\nMbongeni Mbonambi appears to have edged ahead of Malcolm Marx for the Springboks\n\n3 Kyle Sinckler (England)\n\nAlong with Marler, Sinckler helped England gain the upper hand at scrum time and put in what is now a trademark performance with the ball in hand, bringing other forwards into play with clever passing when not bashing over the gainline himself.\n\nKyle Sinckler helped ensure England won the forward battle against Argentina\n\n4 Lood de Jager (South Africa)\n\nAnother who may have forced himself into Rassie Erasmus' first-choice XV with his World Cup displays so far. A workhorse who rarely puts a foot wrong, crucially he worked well in tandem with premier lock Eben Etzebeth against Italy.\n\nLood de Jager has been a model of consistency at the World Cup so far for South Africa\n\n5 Sam Whitelock (New Zealand)\n\nA calming presence for the All Blacks for so long now, Whitelock led his country out against Namibia as Brodie Retallick returned from injury alongside him. So often out of the limelight as Retallick grabs the headlines, Whitelock's consistency is key now more than ever. Didn't put a foot wrong and scored just his fifth try in 115 Tests.\n\nSam Whitelock captained the All Blacks against Namibia in his 115th Test\n\n6 Josh Navidi (Wales)\n\nAnother to make a second entry into our team of the week, Navidi's display rather summed up Wales' against Fiji. He started slowly, shocked by Fiji's intensity, but gradually worked his way into the game by winning the breakdown. A real battler who led the defensive line stoically.\n\nJosh Navidi helped Wales battle back from a slow start against Fiji to win\n\n8 Kazuki Himeno (Japan)\n\nHaving moved to No 8 from the blindside during the win over Ireland, Himeno started there against Samoa and gave Japan an extra edge at the breakdown. Carried more than any other forward, put in 11 tackles and scored a try.\n\nKazuki Himeno scores his try off a rolling maul to continue his fine World Cup so far\n\n7 John Barclay (Scotland)\n\nVeteran flanker captained Scotland for the first time since the 2018 Six Nations and led by example with a strong display against the physical Russian pack, before scoring a well-deserved try towards the end.", "description": "The Rugby World Cup is now at its halfway stage at the end of week three with the knockout stages starting to take shape.
