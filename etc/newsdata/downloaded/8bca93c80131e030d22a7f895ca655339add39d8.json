It also inquired what Seoul believes the cost to be.\n\n\"Another question asked about the possibility of SLBMs being tipped with biochemical warheads,\" a military spokesman said. \"It seemed that they were particularly interested in biochemical weapons, which had been overlooked compared to missiles and nuclear weapons that could pose a direct threat to the U.S.\"\n\nThe Defense Ministry held a meeting to discuss how to answer the questions and concluded it was unable to offer any more information than had already been reported in the media. \"It seems that the ministry's answers were unsatisfactory,\" a diplomatic source said.\n\n", "description": "Seoul 'Unable to Answer N.Korea Sanctions Committee Questions'", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
