Mike Dunleavy faces an effort pushed by leftist special interests to recall him after he delivered on his promises to reduce the size and scope of government and reignite the state\u2019s economy.\n\nDunleavy, an ally of President Donald Trump, faces an effort in his state to recall him because he has cut the state budget significantly and got the economy booming again\u2014a very similar fight to the national impeachment battle that Trump faces.\n\nDunleavy, just like Trump, is fighting through it. He has launched a website to rally voters to his side amid the recall push and appeared on Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend to make his case for why he believes the leftist special interests are targeting both him and Trump.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is this, just like the president\u2014he wasn\u2019t supposed to win. He was not within the establishment. He was not part of the swamp. What people fail to realize, President Trump and what we\u2019re trying to do up here is to work on behalf of the average American and average Alaskan\u2014not the special interests,\u201d Dunleavy said. \u201cIt\u2019s those special interests who are trying to redo the election here in Alaska and trying to impeach the president now nationally.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, we made the fatal error I guess of doing things for our people\u2014the average American, the average Alaskan\u2014and not kowtowing to the establishment and the special interests,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo, I guess this is what you get when you fight on behalf of the average American and average Alaskan. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing, and I think if you asked President Trump he wouldn\u2019t change a thing. So, the fight\u2019s on. They want to try and do a recall or redo the election, but we\u2019re up to the task because we think we\u2019re doing the right thing for Alaska just like the president does for the nation.\u201d\n\nDunleavy won the governorship in 2018, a hotly-contested race against former Democrat U.S. Senator Mark Begich which saw Dunleavy come out on top on a promise to shrink the state\u2019s budget deficits amid fiscal woes while growing the economy.\n\n\u201cWe won the election back in November by 51 percent to 44 percent over former U.S. Senator Mark Begich and it was pretty clear the folks in Alaska sent me down to Juneau to do things differently,\u201d Dunleavy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having a budget issue for some time and we\u2019ve been having about a $1.6 billion deficit. We were looking at about $85 a barrel for oil about this time last year, this day actually, and then it just dropped like a rock down to $53\u2014so we had to make some difficult decisions and we reduced the budget by about $650 million.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were able to close that deficit by about 40 percent. So, there are people on the left who didn\u2019t like this. They don\u2019t want a smaller government,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey wanted us to tax and spend our reserves to maintain the size of government and of course we think that\u2019s a bad idea\u2014we think it\u2019s a much better idea to make government more efficient and manage it better and reduce the footprint and that way people can keep more of their hard-earned money. But the folks who are tied into as you would say the swamp\u2014the folks who are tied into government spending\u2014didn\u2019t like this at all. They decided they want to redo the election, and as a matter of fact, they started talking about this about two and a half months after the election, back in early February.\u201d\n\nDunleavy said that much like how national Democrats panned Trump\u2019s promises of economic success nationally in the 2016 election as impossible or unrealistic, the left and special interests in Alaska panned his vision as one that would doom the state. But they were wrong. CNBC in mid-2018 actually said Alaska was the worst state in America for business\u2013Dunleavy has quickly turned that around.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t run for this job to be governor\u2014I wanted to be governor so I could fix these problems. We\u2019ve been shedding in Alaska for the past several years, thousands and thousands of private-sector jobs,\u201d Dunleavy said. \u201cThe population of Alaska actually shrunk the past several years previous to this. So we made a concerted effort that we were going to get our spending under control, as I mentioned, and manage government better\u2014but at the same, open up Alaska for business. We are an ideal location on the globe. A lot of folks don\u2019t realize this but we are the closest state to Asia by thousands of miles. We are the northernmost state, westernmost state, and easternmost state if you can figure that one out.\u201d\n\n\u201cLong story short, we\u2019ve promoted Alaska\u2014its resources and location on the globe\u2014and the first quarter we got into office and it\u2019s continued since, our unemployment has dropped. It\u2019s the lowest now in nine years,\u201d he continued. \u201cOur GDP is up, the first quarter, 3.6 percent, and we\u2019re expecting some good news here shortly on the GDP here as well. Personal income is up. And we were told that if we made these reductions that the world would end, that people would die, that the world would collapse and that we would be driven back into a recession\u2014but as it stands right now, those reductions that we made have been absorbed into a growing economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we saved the people of Alaska $650 million, closed this gap 40 percent, and at the same time all the economic indicators right now are heading in the right direction,\u201d Dunleavy said. \u201cWe believe we did the right thing given that our revenue picture was pretty dismal, and this allows us to close this gap and get closer to having a sustainable budget for the state of Alaska.\u201d\n\nHe has a close relationship with President Trump, who has focused a large part of his presidency on Asia\u2014particularly on China\u2014and the president stops in Alaska whenever he goes to the Pacific Rim to refuel. That allows Dunleavy the ability to communicate easily with the president in person, and as a result of what Dunleavy has done in the state and what Trump has done nationally, there is a booming energy industry in Alaska now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate because when the president goes to Asia, he stops in Anchorage, Alaska, to refuel,\u201d Dunleavy said. \u201cWhen he does, he contacts our office and we get an opportunity to go on Air Force One and sit down and meet with him and talk to him about business in the state of Alaska. As you mentioned, he wants to get all of America back to work, and it\u2019s been nothing short of an economic miracle what he\u2019s been able to do. With Alaska, he\u2019s been helping us out in trying to get our economy back on its feet and as you know, under the tax bill that was passed, ANWR was opened up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is probably one of the last great areas in North America on the North Slope that has tremendous oil potential\u2014potentially billions of barrels of oil, could produce upwards of 600,000 barrels of oil per day additional to put into the pipeline,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been talking with investors in the lower 48, we have a bit of a renaissance on our North Slope, we have a number of new companies coming up there and we have a number of our older companies that have been up there for a while such as Conoco and Exxon and others and we are finding new oil because of new technology\u2014new conventional oil, large pools of it, potentially billions of barrels of oil. As a matter of fact, we have about $5.5 billion of new investment going into the North Slope, so things are looking up thanks to some of the decisions the administration has made and our philosophy on putting Alaska back to work and using resources to create new wealth not just for our state but for this country.\u201d\n\nAlso mirroring Trump, Dunleavy has zoned in on onerous regulations on a state-level\u2014something the president has done nationally as well. Trump actually told Breitbart News in an Oval Office interview earlier this year that deregulation is perhaps his biggest success.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve identified over 100 regulations that we are slating to remove that get in the way of business but also get in the way of the lives of average Alaskans, but these regulations\u2014we\u2019re going over them to make sure they still provide the safety for our people and our state but the long and short of it is when a government grows often times the bureaucracy takes on a life of its own and develops its own regulations that don\u2019t necessarily benefit the state or the people itself or the businesses that we\u2019re trying to attract to the state of Alaska,\u201d Dunleavy said. \u201cWe got over a hundred regulations we\u2019re looking at, and we have been trying to\u2014we\u2019ve been working very hard at making sure our permitting processes and study processes for industry and new industry coming to the state of Alaska are not onerous so once again we can put people to work, we can bring investment into the state and put people to work. That\u2019s a key component of what we\u2019ve always wanted to do here in Alaska.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a tremendous state in terms of resources, a huge state the size of a subcontinent,\u201d he stated. \u201cWith all these resources coming in from around the globe, we\u2019re trying to make sure we can capitalize on this and put people to work. Those regulations, we\u2019re reviewing them to make sure they\u2019re in the best interests of Alaska and not in the best interests of the bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nLISTEN TO ALASKA GOV.
