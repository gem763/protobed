Why? Because their brains are different!\n\nNo, that\u2019s not some hack joke from some even hackier dude comedian\u2019s standup set from 1993. That\u2019s an actual thing some businesswomen were told at a presentation on female leadership in 2018.\n\nLast year, 30 female executives at mega-huge accounting firm Ernst & Young attended a nearly two-day long training seminar on how to succeed in a male-dominated workplace that focused entirely on how women created hostile work environments for themselves through their own behavior and appearances, as HuffPost reported on Monday.\n\nThe June 2018 seminar came only a few months after a female executive at the firm had filed a complaint against a male partner for sexual assault. Yet the training never addressed this or any of the other instance of workplace sexual assault and harassment, attendees told HuffPost senior reporter Emily Young, offering attendees tips on how their clothing and comportment could improve their experience in the office.\n\nThe whole thing is worth a read, but here are a few of the key tips, tricks, and other findings laid out by the training seminar. Here they are in order of \u201clol wut\u201d to \u201cI\u2019m going to eat a knife\u201d:\n\nLook hot (i.e., spend a lot of money on fancy haircuts, manicures, a new wardrobe, and a gym membership).\n\nIf you\u2019re talking to a man, sit at an angle to him and cross your legs.\n\nDon\u2019t talk to men in meetings unless you\u2019re saying hyper agreeable shit like \u201cYes!\u201d and \u201cBy the supreme buoyancy of mine own pendulous breasts, my lord, yes!\u201d because confronting them in front of others will intimidate them.\n\nWomen\u2019s brains are 6% to 11% smaller than men\u2019s (a point made sans clarification that literal brain size has nothing to do with intelligence or ability)\n\nWomen\u2019s brains are like pancakes because they soak up information, making it harder for them to focus. Men\u2019s brains are like waffles because they\u2019re better at compartmentalizing new things they\u2019re learning into easy to manage squares.\n\nWell, I\u2019ve lost my appetite forever.
