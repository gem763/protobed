But she probably wishes she hadn\u2019t.\n\nBrian pauses for a few moments while he contemplated how to tell his daughter that she was actually eating a pig as he recorded her reaction.\n\nAfter a few moments he tells her: \u2018We turn the pigs into sausages, the sausages are pigs,\u2019 and in horror, Erin replies: \u2018But that\u2019s not very nice!\u2019\n\nErin wasn\u2019t happy after finding out where sausages come from (Picture: Brian Copeland / SWNS.com)\n\nFollowing the news, Brian tries to feed Erin sausages but she tells her dad that she\u2019s \u2018done\u2019 and doesn\u2019t want to eat sausages anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrian, from Glasgow, explained: \u2018Erin asked about where her food came from and I told her how the sausages come from pigs. I was quite specific about it, I told her how we take the pigs and make sausages out of them with machines.\n\n\u2018She said it wasn\u2019t nice and wouldn\u2019t eat the sausages on her plate! She eats them now but her favourite things are cucumbers and carrots!\n\n\u2018She doesn\u2019t have a problem with it now.\n\n\u2018Food is a big thing and I think it\u2019s important children know where it comes from.\n\n\u2018I feel like if she\u2019s old enough to ask the question then she\u2019s old enough to get the answer.\n\n\u2018I love it when she asks questions, being a parent you get a lot of questions but I don\u2019t think children should be shut down when asking questions.\n\n\u2018Erin always asks more questions and I think it\u2019s great!\u2019\n\nHer dad managed to get the moment on camera (Picture: Brian Copeland / SWNS.com)\n\nBrian uploaded a video of the adorable exchange online and was amazed when it took off and his Youtube upload alone gained more than 50,000 views.\n\nThe marketing coordinator said: \u2018I was not expecting anything when I uploaded it, it was mainly for my mother. I uploaded the video onto Reddit and it just blew up! Lots of people loved it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Some people are appalled by it, some think it\u2019s the right thing to do and find it really cute and some people say I should show her the conditions some animals live in but I think she\u2019s a bit too young for that!\n\n\u2018Erin is just really bubbly and always asks questions and I love answering them!\u2019\n\nMORE: Can having sex cause thrush?\n\nMORE: World Food Day: Easy ways to waste less food\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A toddler was captured on camera eating her sausages, only for her dad to tell her where they come from and she says she's done with them.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90132884_1571242889.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
