And on Friday, the markets get both.\n\nTim Duy, a University of Oregon professor, says, after this week\u2019s economic data, the market is starting to price in the possibility not just that the Fed won\u2019t cut by a half-point but that it won\u2019t reduce rates at all this month. \u201cSome might argue that it is not screaming for [a quarter-point] either, but it still looks like cheap insurance against the possibility that watching the data now is too much of an exercise of driving through the rearview window,\u201d Duy said.\n\nDoes the market even want a good jobs number? \u201cWith all the concerns about the economy in recent weeks, we\u2019re probably still in a period where good is good for risk, even if it will price out the more extreme central bank action,\u201d argues Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank.\n\nOne of the stars during this bout of global economic fear has been silver SI00, -2.99%. Not only did it recently reach a three-year high, it is also making inroads on a relative basis to gold GC00, -0.73%\n\n\u201cMarket participants have been missing gold\u2019s upswings and are likely now expressing this through silver and, more recently, platinum PL00, -3.20% as well,\u201d said Joni Teves, a strategist at UBS.\n\nIn the call of the day, Teves says positioning in silver is lean, \u201csuggesting that there should be room for the uptrend to continue.\u201d While net longs on gold were at record levels, silver was 74% of the record. Plus, silver trading on the Shanghai Gold Exchange has picked up. That said, Teves said silver\u2019s higher volatility implies a \u201cmore nimble attitude\u201d as opposed to strategic gold positions.\n\nMarkets\n\nFollowing the 372-point blast higher in the Dow industrials on Thursday, U.S. stock futures ES00, +0.39% YM00, +0.40% NQ00, +0.31% rose modestly.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, +2.02% reached 1.59%, up 3 basis points.\n\nAsian stocks ADOW, +0.42% played catch-up to the Wall Street rally while European stock action SXXP, +0.24% was muted.\n\nThe buzz\n\nJobs data is due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Economists polled by MarketWatch expect 173,000 new jobs were created, an unemployment rate of 3.7% and a 0.3% increase in hourly wages. Hours worked will be another key part of the report after falling to a nearly two-year low in July. Companies tend to cut back hours before laying off workers. Canada is reporting its jobs numbers as well.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is going to get the last word before the central bank goes silent ahead of its Sept. 17-18 policy meeting. Powell is scheduled to speak in Switzerland, at the University of Zurich, about the U.S. economic outlook and interest-rate policy at 12:30 p.m. Eastern.\n\nChina on Friday cut its reserve-requirement ratio by a half-point.\n\nThe housing sector will be in the spotlight following the Treasury Department\u2019s release of the long-awaited plan for the reform of state-sponsored mortgage backers Fannie Mae FNMA, +1.71% and Freddie Mac FMCC, -0.36%. State attorneys general next week are preparing probes into Facebook FB, +2.01% and Alphabet GOOG, +2.54% unit Google, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nThe chart\n\nAs Porsche\u2019s Taycan gets rolled out, the stock market chart for Tesla TSLA, +4.03% isn\u2019t looking particularly good, points out Greg Guenther over at The Rude Awakening blog. Whether Porsche\u2019s electric car is a competitor or not\u2014it is priced over $150,000\u2014remains to be seen, but Tesla is struggling to rally from its July lows.\n\nThe tweet\n\nA U.K. columnist raised eyebrows for this tweet on the death of longtime Zimbabwe strongman Robert Mugabe.\n\nMugabe was a bad man yet he helped win his country independence. As we have learned here this week, that's never easy. \u2014 Quentin Letts (@thequentinletts) September 6, 2019\n\nRandom reads\n\nMugabe\u2019s topsy-turvy rule became the narrative of Zimbabwe\u2019s independence story.\n\nA 73-year-old woman gave birth to twins.\n\nThe Loch Ness Monster may just be a giant eel.\n\nNeed to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.
