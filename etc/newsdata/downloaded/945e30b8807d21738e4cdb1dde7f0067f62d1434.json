He said in grappling with whether to cancel the tour, he worried it would \u201clikely have a negative impact on Eastman\u2019s reputation within China, and potentially limit other opportunities to recruit, perform, and tour for our faculty and other ensembles.\u201d\n\nThe decision comes on the heels of two high-profile situations involving American institutions and the Chinese government. Apple earlier this month, under pressure from China, removed a smartphone app that enabled Hong Kong protesters to track police. Earlier, China\u2019s state TV canceled broadcasts of NBA games over a tweet by the general manager of the Houston Rockets in support of the protesters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really uncomfortable because we want what\u2019s best for (our colleagues), we want what\u2019s best for the school, we want what\u2019s best for our relationship with China,\u201d trombone player Sophie Volpe told Rochester station WHAM last week.\n\nEighty members of the group had been scheduled to tour eight cities over 12 days.\n\nAfter announcing that the tour would go forward, Rossi said, university officials continued to try, unsuccessfully, to obtain visas for the South Korean students through various channels. Consultation with university leadership, the tour organizers and others led to the decision to postpone, he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An upstate New York orchestra reversed course on Tuesday and canceled plans to tour China this winter after China refused to allow the group's three South Korean musicians to perform.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Carolyn Thompson"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
