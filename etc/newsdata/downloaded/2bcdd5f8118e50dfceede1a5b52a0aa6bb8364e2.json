The United States, European powers and Saudi Arabia blamed the strike on Iran, which denies involvement. Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group has claimed responsibility.\n\nSeveral countries, including Saudi Arabia, have responded to a U.S. call to form an international maritime coalition to protect commercial shipping in the Strait of Hormuz after attacks earlier this year on several oil tankers in Gulf waters.\n\nWashington and Riyadh have blamed those attacks too on Iran, which it denies.\n\n\u201cThis visit was an opportunity to discuss our mutual efforts going forward to coordinate defense against provocation and attack,\u201d Malloy said in a statement, citing the importance of regional efforts to counter what it called \u201cIranian aggression\u201d.\n\nUnder Washington\u2019s proposed maritime mission, the United States would provide coordinating ships and lead surveillance efforts while allies would patrol nearby waters and escort commercial vessels with their nation\u2019s flags.\n\nGulf states, which are big purchasers of Western arms, have invested more in air and land capabilities than in naval assets, and have little experience of coordinating large naval missions.", "description": "The commander of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command visited Riyadh over the weekend to discuss with the head of Saudi Arabia's naval forces reinforcing defenses against Iranian threats, the command said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
