By no means is she a danger to society.\u201d\n\nIn hundreds of texts and statements that came to light after Roy\u2019s suicide, Carter, who was 17 when Roy died, was revealed to have pushed him to go through with the act. The judge who found her guilty cited her written admission to a friend that she told Roy to \u201cget back in\u201d the truck after he stepped out and shared his last-minute fears in a call to Carter before he died.\n\nView photos Conrad Roy | Roy Family More\n\nRELATED: Did Michelle Carter Really Tell Boyfriend to \u2018Get Back In\u2019 Truck to Kill Himself?\n\n\u2022 Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?
