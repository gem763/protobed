All of our child hood dreams are coming true.\n\nWe're talking huge rooms decked out in pink furniture (of course), a private cinema, a huge infinity pool with oceanfront views, sun loungers, a hobby studio, sport court, meditation space, and a massive walk-in closet filled with plenty of her iconic outfits.\n\n(Image: Airbnb)\n\nOh, and guests can enjoy unique experiences such as a meet-and-greet with hairstylist Jen Atkin, who counts the Kardashians and Chrissy Teigen amongst her clients, while also getting treated to hair makeovers from hairstylists from Mane Addicts Creator Collective.\n\n(Image: Airbnb)\n\nThe best part? An overnight stay costs $60 a night - approximately \u00a346 - which is cheaper than actually buying the toy version of the incredible home.\n\nThere are various versions of the Barbie Malibu Townhouse, but it's quite expensive - prices on Amazon start from \u00a3107.44 , but some versions can cost over \u00a3220.\n\n(Image: Airbnb)\n\nOf course once you've factored in the flights to California, where the real-life Malibu Dreamhouse is located, so overall it won't work out cheaper, but we're still in awe of the budget-friendly rate. (You'll also need to pay some extra taxes and fees but these still won't compare to the \u00a3220 prices).\n\nAfter all, it's a pretty incredible holiday rental.\n\n(Image: Airbnb)\n\nSadly for Brits, you're going to need to be quick and ready to drop everything for a stay.\n\nThat's because the Malibu Dreamhouse is opening for a one-time, two night stay from the Sunday 27th to Tuesday 29th October. (Although the property is huge, it actually will only sleep four guests for the experience).\n\n(Image: Airbnb)\n\nStill, there are heaps of once-in-a-lifetime experiences to be had for those who are lucky enough to bag a stay.\n\nThese include a one-on-one fencing lesson with Olympic medallist Ibtihaj Muhammad, a cooking lesson with Gina Clarke-Helm of Malibu Seaside Chef, and even a behind-the-scenes tour of nearby Columbia Memorial Space Centre with pilot and aerospace engineer Jill Meyers.\n\n(Image: Airbnb)\n\nBookings open on the Airbnb listing on Wednesday 23rd October, so even if you do manage to reserve the stay, you'll need to drop everything pretty quickly for a late getaway.\n\n(Image: Airbnb)\n\nOf course if you are planning to be in California, it could make for a fun surprise for the itinerary. Alternatively, if you're really dedicated, you could check Skyscanner for cheap Los Angeles flights .\n\nTo mark the special listing, Airbnb will be making a donation to The Barbie Dream Gap Project GoFundMe initiative .", "description": "Barbie's Malibu Dreamhouse has become a reality with an infinity pool, walk-in wardrobe and cinema and it's incredible", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Airbnb"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20642197.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_You-can-stay-inside-a-real-life-Barbie-Dreamhouse-and-its-the-stuff-of-childhood-dreams.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
