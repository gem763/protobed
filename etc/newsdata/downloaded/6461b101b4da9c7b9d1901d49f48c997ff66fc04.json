They\u2019re trying to avoid taking on Donald Trump while looking sort of sad about the way our president wanted to trade military aid to another country for dirt on a political opponent.\n\nOr just evading. \u201cI don\u2019t know what law he\u2019s violated yet,\u201d said Senator Rick Scott of Florida.\n\nThis is not really to the point, given that Congress can remove a president for a terrible misuse of power that isn\u2019t literally against a law. And if Scott\u2019s goal was to dodge the whole matter, he certainly lost. On Wednesday, Trump said his but-about-Biden\u2019s-son talk with the president of Ukraine was above reproach, adding, \u201cI heard Rick Scott say that was a perfect conversation.\u201d\n\nFloridians, feel free to put up posters with that quote all over your neighborhoods.\n\nIt would take 67 senators to convict Trump if the House votes to impeach. That\u2019s quite a lift given that the Republicans control the chamber 53 to 47. A lot of them are terrified that if they vote against the president, some Trump-loving jerk from Fred County will run against them in a primary, sending them off to a career lobbying for pharmaceutical companies way earlier than they anticipated.\n\nSo far the expressions of outrage are pretty darned muted. Well, Senators Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse did call the Ukraine story \u201ctroubling.\u201d", "description": "See the senators shilly-shally.", "authors": ["Gail Collins"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/opinion/02collinsWeb/02collinsWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
