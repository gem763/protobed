Carbon emissions from the flights will be fully offset, Qantas says.\n\nThe on-board research is being designed in partnership with Sydney University's Charles Perkins Centre and Monash University.\n\nPeople in the cabin \u2013 mostly Qantas employees \u2013 will be fitted with wearable technology devices and take part in specific experiences at varying stages of the flight.\n\nScientists and medical experts from the Charles Perkins Centre will monitor sleep patterns, food and beverage consumption, lighting, physical movement and inflight entertainment to assess impact on health, wellbeing and body clock.\n\nMonash University researchers will work with pilots to record crew melatonin levels before, during and after the flights.\n\nPilots will wear an EEG (electroencephalogram) device that tracks brain wave patterns and monitors alertness. The aim, says Qantas, is to establish data to assist in building the optimum work and rest pattern for pilots operating long-haul services.\n\nQantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said the flights will give medical experts the chance to do real-time research that will translate into health and wellbeing benefits.\n\nPeople in the cabin \u2013 mostly Qantas employees \u2013 will be fitted with wearable technology devices and take part in specific experiences at varying stages of the flight\n\nPROJECT SUNRISE RESEARCH FLIGHTS \u2013 KEY FACTS Non-stop flights on brand new 787-9s from New York and London to Sydney will take around 19 hours each, subject to wind and weather conditions. The data will be used to inform all Sunrise flight planning, including from Brisbane and Melbourne.\n\nCabins will be fully fitted out and otherwise ready to enter normal commercial service.\n\nFlights will have up to 40 people (including crew) on board and a minimum of luggage and catering to extend the range of 787-9.\n\nOther than crew, those in the cabin will mostly be Qantas employees taking part in testing. No seats will be sold as these flights are for research purposes only.\n\nAfter the flights, each brand new aircraft will enter regular service with Qantas International \u2013 with just a few extra miles on the clock.\n\nQantas 'operates the largest airline carbon offset scheme in the world'. This same program will be used to offset all the carbon emissions from the three flights.\n\nNo commercial airline has ever flown direct from New York to Australia. Qantas has once flown non-stop from London to Sydney in 1989 to mark the entry into service of the Boeing 747-400. That flight had a total of 23 people on board and minimal internal fit-out in order to provide the range. The aircraft, registered VH-OJA, was donated by Qantas in 2017 to the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society near Wollongong, New South Wales.\n\nHe said: 'Ultra-long-haul flying presents a lot of common sense questions about the comfort and wellbeing of passengers and crew. These flights are going to provide invaluable data to help answer them.\n\n'For customers, the key will be minimising jet lag and creating an environment where they are looking forward to a restful, enjoyable flight. For crew, it's about using scientific research to determine the best opportunities to promote alertness when they are on duty and maximise rest during their down time on these flights.\n\n'Flying non-stop from the East Coast of Australia to London and New York is truly the final frontier in aviation, so we're determined to do all the groundwork to get this right.\n\n'No airline has done this kind of dedicated research before and we'll be using the results to help shape the cabin design, inflight service and crew roster patterns for Project Sunrise. We'll also be looking at how we can use it to improve our existing long-haul flights.'\n\nQantas has already conducted data on passenger sleep strategies on its direct Perth to London service, and some of these initial findings will be assessed further as part of these dedicated research flights. Customer feedback on food choices, separate stretching and wellbeing zones and entertainment options will also be tested.\n\nFindings on crew wellbeing data will be shared with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to help inform regulatory requirements associated with ultra-long-haul flights.\n\nAirbus and Boeing have both pitched aircraft (A350 and 777X) to Qantas that are capable of operating Project Sunrise flights with a viable commercial payload.\n\nA final decision on Project Sunrise \u2013 which depends on aircraft economics, regulatory approvals and industrial agreements \u2013 is expected by the end of December 2019.\n\nMr Joyce added: 'There's plenty of enthusiasm for Sunrise, but it's not a foregone conclusion. This is ultimately a business decision and the economics have to stack up.'\n\nQantas will operate another research flight from London to Sydney in November - and MailOnline Travel will be on board.", "description": "No commercial airline has ever flown non-stop from New York to Australia, but that's about to change.
