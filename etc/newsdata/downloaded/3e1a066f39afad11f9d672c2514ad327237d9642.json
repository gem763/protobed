That\u2019s the only word that can be used to describe the fallout from The New York Times\u2019botched Brett Kavanaugh story. To recap, the Times\u2019 Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly decided to write a book attacking Kavanaugh, trying to reveal that all the allegations lobbed at the sitting Supreme Court justice were true. Not the case. In fact, it\u2019s pretty much a worthless book, but they did supposedly have some bombshell about a new accuser who alleged that Kavanaugh shoved his private parts in front of her, like Deborah Ramirez alleged, during a college party at Yale. Ramirez\u2019s story was part of the Democrat-media complex\u2019s coordinated political hit against Kavanaugh during his confirmation process. Yet, there is a problem. This supposed new accuser doesn\u2019t remember this ever happening. So, it\u2019s a nothing burger. The Times added that portion made a note, and totally changed the entire story. Pogrebin and Kelly blamed the editors. Then, they attacked the Left\u2019s favorite target: Fox News (via Vox) [Italicized text indicates a portion of NYT Story):\n\n\u2026the Times did not, in fact, \u201ccorrect\u201d anything. To make a \u201ccorrection\u201d to a story indicates something was factually wrong. The newspaper did not acknowledge anything of this sort. Instead, the Times story \u2014 based on a forthcoming book Pogrebin and Kelly are writing about the Kavanaugh allegations \u2014 was updated to say that friends of the student who may have been assaulted say she does not remember the alleged incident. Here\u2019s the relevant passage of the Times piece, with the clause that was added in the second version in bold: We also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez\u2019s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. Mr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about this account, but the F.B.I. did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly. We corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier; the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the episode. To be clear, the change is a significant one. If the student doesn\u2019t recall the episode, the accusation that Kavanaugh and others may have assaulted her is arguably weaker than if she did. But, contrary to what Fox News would have you believe, the change to the Times story does not prove that the alleged incident didn\u2019t happen.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely Fox News\u2019 fault that you\u2019ve spent the last five days stepping on rakes. https://t.co/2NQiMGMWnc \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) September 18, 2019\n\nThis article centers solely around the fact that Fox News is calling this a \u201ccorrection\u201d when the New York Times called it just an \u201cEditor\u2019s Note.\u201d Okay...\n\n\n\n\u201cAs soon as we realized this, we corrected it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Robin Pogrebin (@rpogrebin)\n\n\n\nLiterally Yesterday.pic.twitter.com/m9nJK8nboX https://t.co/y0rGgqw2F3 \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) September 18, 2019\n\nIn case you missed the @nytimes latest stealth edit: https://t.co/NKbNIZJSMa \u2014 Jeryl Bier (@JerylBier) September 16, 2019\n\nThe @nytimes in the morning:\n\n\n\nBREAKING: New assault allegations surface against Justice Kavanaugh.\n\n\n\nThe @nytimes in the evening: Correction, we forgot to tell you that the alleged victim says that the alleged assault never happened.\n\n\n\nTHIS IS WHY AMERICANS DON\u2019T TRUST YOU! pic.twitter.com/BwPtnMaAhY \u2014 The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) September 16, 2019\n\nThe story:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Liberal activist A says that Kavanaugh assulted lady B back when he was in college.\n\n\n\n\u2022 The @nytimes contacts lady B.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Lady B tells @nytimes she has no idea what liberal activist A is talking about.\n\n\n\n\u2022 @nytimes publishes story without comments from Lady B. \u2014 The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) September 15, 2019\n\nYeah, it is a significant change, as in renders the entire story worthless. We all know about Ramirez, Christine Blasey Ford, and Julie Swetnick\u2014the latter of which was dismissed outright for being totally outrageous. Oh, and she pretty much recanted the entire allegation because it was trash. Ford and Ramirez have zero corroborating witnesses. Leland Keyser, the star witnesses for Ford, now says she was bullied into revising her remarks because they didn\u2019t sufficiently back-up the former\u2019s account that Kavanaugh had raped her in high school. She also says Ford\u2019s account made no sense. She wasn\u2019t the only one who thought that; anyone with cognitive function knew Ford\u2019s account was sloppy. This isn\u2019t about Fox News. This is about the Times trying to get the Kavanaugh impeachment circus going and totally failing in the effort. This Hail Mary was denied. Kavanaugh is still on the Supreme Court and Trump is still president. Deal with it. Also, if this is seriously about a correction and an editor\u2019s note, this is a distinction without a difference. And the reason why the new information was added was over the fact that this was a mistake.\n\nThe new accuser doesn't remember? How can you omit that?\n\nWhether the writers had already included it in their original copy remains to be seen. I don\u2019t trust liberals or their media allies, so when you forget to include something and then add it\u2014isn\u2019t that also a correction? And this wasn\u2019t Fox News\u2019 doing. Don\u2019t get mad at us when we point out your bad behavior. It\u2019s not Fox News\u2019 fault that you got a face-full of buckshot trying to take down a superbly qualified Supreme Court justice. People should know when they\u2019ve lost and when they\u2019ve been conquered. For the Left, they have yet to learn that valuable lesson.", "description": ".09/18/2019 19:18:36PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/275/bf8e294b-f378-45b8-8195-2cb8365fd3ce.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
