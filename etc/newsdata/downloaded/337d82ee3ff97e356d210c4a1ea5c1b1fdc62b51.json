But the Democratic Unionist Party said it still can\u2019t support the deal.\n\nThat makes the parliamentary arithmetic a lot tighter for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who needs the backing of the House of Commons in a vote expected Saturday in order to deliver an orderly Brexit on October 31.\n\nThree DUP officials said their party won\u2019t support the deal, saying they were unhappy about customs checks in the Irish Sea, among other things. Johnson\u2019s been defeated in a string of crucial votes since taking office in July and lost his majority in the chamber. Nevertheless, the prime minister announced the agreement with an upbeat statement.\n\nWithout his Northern Irish allies, Johnson needs to pick up roughly 61 votes from a pool of just 75 available deputies -- that will involve persuading hold-outs in his own party to side with him rather than the DUP. It\u2019s the final, treacherous hurdle for the U.K. leader to clear before he can complete his ambition of leading Britain out of the EU.\n\nStocks Jump With Pound on Brexit Deal; Bonds Slump: Markets Wrap\n\nThe withdrawal agreement was completed just in time for EU leaders to assess it when they meet later today in the Belgian capital. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker hailed it as \u201cfair and balanced.\u201d\n\nPull it off, and Johnson will draw a line under three years of political turmoil since the U.K. voted to leave the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc. That journey has strained its relationship with historic allies, soured the political debate at home, and tested the patience of voters.\n\nNegotiators in Brussels and London this week have gone from optimism to dismay and back again, with the pound twitching at every murmur. It rallied on news of the deal, touching $1.2990 before paring gains.\n\nIn a revised political declaration, the two sides pledged to:\n\nestablish a wide-ranging free trade agreementreach a deal on services that goes beyond WTO levelsagree equivalence for financial services firmsallow free movement of capitalestablish visa-free travel for short-term visitscommit to a level playing field, with common high standards in state aid, competition, welfare, tax, and environmental mattersAt a Glance: the Key Points of the Brexit Political Declaration\n\nNow, the many predictions about the costs or benefits of Brexit may be put to the test. At the very least, businesses and travelers may be spared the inevitable disruption that would have been triggered by Britain crashing out without a deal. For both sides, the agreement is a chance to move their political agendas on and to start focusing on their future trading relationship.\n\nEU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told reporters in Brussels that he believes the deal can be ratified by the end of October. He called it a \u201cfair and reasonable basis for an orderly withdrawal\u201d by the U.K.\n\nIn a nod to the painful wrangling of the past three years, he also compared getting the deal done to climbing a mountain.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for a second referendum, saying in Brussels that Johnson\u2019s deal -- which he described as a \u201csell-out\u201d -- was worse than that put forward by predecessor Theresa May.\n\nMost importantly Johnson, who became the face of Brexit during the 2016 referendum campaign, needs to convince the DUP he is not selling them out and to persuade Brexit true-believers that this is a real separation rather than a pointless fudge.\n\nCertainly, die-hard Brexiteers are sounding like they could hold their noses and let Johnson\u2019s deal fly.\n\n\u201cThe deal sounds like it could well be tolerable,\u201d said Steve Baker, who leads that faction in Parliament.\n\n(Updates with DUP reaction.)\n\n--With assistance from Richard Bravo and Tim Ross.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ian Wishart in Brussels at iwishart@bloomberg.net;Nikos Chrysoloras in Brussels at nchrysoloras@bloomberg.net;Kitty Donaldson in London at kdonaldson1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Adam Blenford, Rosalind Mathieson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.Negotiators from the U.K. reached an agreement with officials in Brussels Thursday that could pave the way for Britain to finally break 46 years of ties with the European Union.
