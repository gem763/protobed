In 2017, when she was a graduate student in experimental psychology at the University of Oxford researching how social media influences communication, alarming articles began to appear. Giving a child a smartphone was like giving a kid cocaine, claimed one. Smartphones might have destroyed a generation, said another. Orben didn\u2019t think such extreme statements were warranted. At one point, she stayed up all night reanalyzing data from a paper linking increases in depression and suicide to screen time. \u201cI figured out that tweaks to the data analysis caused major changes to the study results,\u201d Orben says. \u201cThe effects were actually tiny.\u201d\n\nShe published several blog posts, some with her Oxford colleague Andrew K. Przybylski, saying so. \u201cGreat claims require great evidence,\u201d she wrote in one. \u201cYet this kind of evidence does not exist.\u201d Then Orben decided to make her point scientifically and changed the focus of her work. With Przybylski, she set out to rigorously analyze the large-scale data sets that are widely used in studies of social media.\n\nThe two researchers were not the only ones who were concerned. A few years ago Jeff Hancock, a psychologist who runs the Social Media Lab at Stanford University, set an alert to let him know when his research was cited by other scientists in their papers. As the notifications piled up in his in-box, he was perplexed. A report on the ways that Facebook made people more anxious would be followed by one about how social media enhances social capital. \u201cWhat is going on with all these conflicting ideas?\u201d Hancock wondered. How could they all be citing his work? He decided to seek clarity and embarked on the largest meta-analysis to date of the effects of social media on psychological well-being. Ultimately he included 226 papers and data on more than 275,000 people.\n\nThe results of Orben\u2019s, Przybylski\u2019s and Hancock\u2019s efforts are now in. Studies from these researchers and others, published or presented in 2019, have brought some context to the question of what exactly digital technology is doing to our mental health. Their evidence makes several things clear. The results to date have been mixed because the effects measured are themselves mixed. \u201cUsing social media is essentially a trade-off,\u201d Hancock says. \u201cYou get very small but significant advantages for your well-being that come with very small but statistically significant costs.\u201d The emphasis is on \u201csmall\u201d\u2014at least in terms of effect size, which gauges the strength of the relation between two variables. Hancock\u2019s meta-analysis revealed an overall effect size of 0.01 on a scale in which 0.2 is small. Przybylski and Orben measured the percent of variance in well-being that was explained by social media use and found that technology was no more associated with decreased well-being for teenagers than eating potatoes. Wearing glasses was worse. \u201cThe monster-of-the-week thing is dead in the water,\u201d Przybylski says.\n\nFurthermore, this new research reveals serious limitations and shortcomings in the science of social media to date. Eighty percent of studies have been cross-sectional (looking at individuals at a given point in time) and correlational (linking two measures such as frequency of Facebook use and level of anxiety but not showing that one causes the other). Most have relied on self-reported use, a notoriously unreliable measure. Nearly all assess only frequency and duration of use rather than content or context. \u201cWe\u2019re asking the wrong questions,\u201d Hancock says. And results are regularly overstated\u2014sometimes by the scientists, often by the media. \u201cSocial media research is the perfect storm showing us where all the problems are with our scientific methodology,\u201d Orben says. \u201cThis challenges us as scientists to think about how we measure things and what sort of effect size we think is important.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, it is not that social media is never a problem. Heavy use is associated with potentially harmful effects on well-being. But effects from social media appear to depend on the user\u2014age and mental health status are two important factors that make a difference. Also, cause and effect appear to go in both directions. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-way street,\u201d Hancock says.\n\nThe hope is that the field will use these new findings to embark on a new science of social media that will set higher standards for statistical analysis, avoid preposterous claims, and include more experimental and longitudinal studies, which track people at multiple time points. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be a field in which we say that potato eating has destroyed a generation,\u201d says clinical neuropsychologist Tracy Dennis-Tiwary of Hunter College. \u201cDespite our concerns, we need to pull ourselves together and act like scientists. We have to have adequate evidence.\u201d\n\nFear of Technology\n\nAnxiety and panic over the effects of new technology date back to Socrates, who bemoaned the then new tradition of writing things down for fear it would diminish the power of memory. Thomas Hobbes and Thomas Jefferson both warned that communal relationships would suffer as industrial societies moved from rural to urban living. \u201cBefore we hated smartphones, we hated cities,\u201d write sociologists Keith Hampton of Michigan State University and Barry Wellman of the NetLab Network, based in Toronto, both of whom study the effects of technological innovation. Radio, video games and even comic books have all caused consternation. Television was going to bring about the dumbing down of America.\n\nEven so, the change that came about from mobile phones, the Internet and social networking sites feels seismic. Cell phones were first widely adopted in the 1990s. By 2018, 95 percent of American adults were using them. Smartphones, which added instant access to the Internet, entered the mainstream with the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, and now more than three quarters of U.S. adults have them. Eighty-nine percent of those adults use the Internet. There is near saturation for all things digital among adolescents and adults younger than 50 and among higher-income households. Nonusers tend to be older than 65, poor, or residents of rural areas or other places with limited service. Between 2005, when the Pew Research Center began tracking social media use, and 2019, the proportion of Americans using social media to connect, keep up with the news, share information and be entertained went from 5 to 72 percent\u2014that means it jumped from one in 20 adults to seven in 10.\n\nBecause social media is so new, the science investigating its effects is also new. The earliest study Hancock could find that examined social media use and psychological well-being was done in 2006. It came as no surprise that early approaches were limited. Physician Brian Primack, who headed the Center for Research on Media, Technology, and Health at the University of Pittsburgh until moving to the University of Arkansas this year, likens the field to initial research on nutrition: \u201cIt took a while to say, \u2018Let\u2019s split out fats and proteins and carbohydrates, and not just that, but let\u2019s split out trans-fats and polyunsaturated fats,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important for anyone who is doing good research to adapt to what\u2019s going on.\u201d Primack points to his own early work, such as studies that looked only at overall social media use, as examples of what will not cut it anymore. \u201cYou might be spending two hours a day clicking \u2018like\u2019 on pictures of cute puppies, and I might be spending two hours a day having violent clashes about politics and religion and other hot-button issues. Studies like my early one would count [those activities] the same.\u201d\n\nMany people in the field have been particularly critical of work by psychologist Jean M. Twenge of San Diego State University. In addition to her research papers, Twenge\u2019s popular 2017 article in the Atlantic, based on her book iGen, was the one that asked: \u201cHas the Smartphone Destroyed a Generation?\u201d Twenge is hardly the only researcher to publish negative findings about social media use, but the publicity around her work has made her one of the most high profile. She points to a steep rise in mental health issues among the group born between 1995 and 2012 and writes that \u201cmuch of this deterioration can be traced to their phones.\u201d Her work compares rising rates of depression and anxiety among young people to the proliferation of smartphones in the same time period. Twenge acknowledges that the link is correlational but argues that her conclusions represent \u201ca logical sequence of events\u201d based on the evidence\u2014and care is warranted: \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about the health of children and teens, it seems to me we should err on the side of caution.\u201d\n\nNo one disagrees about the importance of young people\u2019s health, but they do think that Twenge has gotten ahead of the science. \u201cWhy wait for causal evidence?\u201d says Dennis-Tiwary. Because the story might not be so straightforward. She points to a longitudinal study done by researchers in Canada in response to one of Twenge\u2019s articles. They studied nearly 600 adolescents and more than 1,000 young adults over two and six years, respectively, and found that social media use did not predict depressive symptoms but that depressive symptoms predicted more frequent social media use among adolescent girls. \u201cThis is a much more nuanced story,\u201d Dennis-Tiwary says. \u201cWe know that problematic smartphone use may as likely be a result of mental health problems as a cause, and that calls for a different set of solutions.\u201d\n\nCorrelational studies have their uses, just as epidemiological research can suggest a link between pollution and increased cancer rates when a randomized clinical trial is not possible. While he thinks it is important not to overstate findings, economist Matthew Gentzkow of Stanford, who studies social media, says of Twenge\u2019s work that \u201cthere are some pretty striking facts there. They don\u2019t tell us whether smartphones are causing mental health problems, but they really shine some light on that possibility. What we need now is to dig in and try to do more careful studies to isolate what\u2019s really going on.\u201d\n\nCredit: Mark Zingarelli\n\nA Two-Way Street?\n\nThat is what the newest studies set out to do. Hancock\u2019s meta-analysis highlighted the fact that many studies on social media and psychological well-being did not measure the same outcomes. Effects generally fell into one of six categories. Three concern positive indicators of well-being: eudaemonic happiness (having a sense of meaning), hedonic happiness (joy in the moment) and relationships. And three are negative: depression, anxiety and loneliness. Hancock and his team found that more social media use was associated slightly with higher depression and anxiety (though not loneliness) and more strongly associated with relationship benefits (though not eudaemonic or hedonic well-being). (The largest effect, at 0.20, was the benefit of stronger relationships.) He and his colleagues also found that active rather than passive use was positively associated with well-being. (They found no effect for passive use, although others have found it to be negative.)\n\nAnd how researchers asked questions mattered. Framing questions around \u201caddiction\u201d rather than more neutrally makes a negative finding more likely. In all the literature, there were only 24 longitudinal studies, the \u201cgold standard\u201d that allows researchers to compare the relation between well-being and social media use at two points in time and statistically assess which variable is driving change in the other. In these, Hancock\u2019s team found a further small but interesting result. \u201cWhen you have higher well-being, you use social media less, which suggests that well-being is driving [how much use is made of] social media to some degree,\u201d Hancock says.\n\nIn a trilogy of papers about adolescent technology use, Orben and Przybylski tackled three major pitfalls they had identified in previous analyses of large-scale data sets. The first paper, published in January in Nature Human Behaviour, provided both context and a method for improving transparency. It included three data sets from the U.S. and Europe made up of more than 350,000 adolescents. Such data sets are valuable but make it easy to turn up statistically significant results that may not be of practical significance. Przybylski and Orben calculated that if they had followed standard statistical operating procedure, they could have produced roughly 10,000 papers showing negative screen effects, 5,000 indicating no effect and another 4,000 demonstrating positive technology effects on young people\u2014all from the same data sets.\n\nFor their new analysis, they used a technique called specification curve analysis, a tool that examines the full range of possible correlations at once. It is the statistical equivalent of seeing the forest for the trees. Analyzed in this way, digital technology use was associated with only 0.4 percent of the variation in adolescent well-being. The wealth of information in the data allowed for the telling comparisons with potatoes and glasses. It also revealed that smoking marijuana and bullying had much larger negative associations for well-being (at 2.7 and 4.3 times worse, respectively, than the average in one of the data sets), whereas positive behaviors such as getting enough sleep and regularly eating breakfast were much more strongly linked to well-being than technology use. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to move from this mindset of cherry-picking one result to a more holistic picture,\u201d Przybylski says. \u201cA key part of that is being able to put these extremely minuscule effects of screens on young people in a real-world context.\u201d (Twenge and others question the usefulness of explaining percentages of variation and say it will always turn up small numbers that might mask practical effects.)\n\nTheir second paper, published in April in Psychological Science, included stronger methods for measuring screen time. They used three data sets from the U.S., the U.K. and Ireland that included time-use diaries in addition to self-reported media usage and measures of well-being. Over a period of five years the more than 17,000 teenagers in the studies were given a diary one day each year. They filled in 10- to 15-minute windows all day long about exactly what they were doing, including use of digital technologies. When Orben and Przybylski applied their statistical technique to the data, there was little evidence for substantial negative associations between digital engagement and well-being. The diaries also allowed them to look at when during the day adolescents were using digital media, including before bed. Even that did not make a difference in well-being, although they did not look at hours of sleep as an outcome, only more general psychological measures.\n\nAnd finally, in May, with psychologist Tobias Dienlin of the University of Hohenheim in Germany, Orben and Przybylski published a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, incorporating longitudinal data to analyze the effect of social media on adolescents\u2019 life satisfaction over time. This approach allowed them to ask whether adolescents who are on social media more in a given year than average feel better or worse at year\u2019s end and whether feeling better or worse than normal changes social media use in the coming year. Here, too, the result was small and nuanced. \u201cThe change in social media use in one year only predicts about 0.25 percent of the variance in the change in life satisfaction over one year,\u201d Orben says. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about fractions of 1 percent changes.\u201d The researchers did, however, see slightly stronger effects in girls than in boys, a finding Orben intends to investigate further. The question of individual risk will also be important. \u201cWe really want to see if there are reproducible profiles of young people who are more or less vulnerable or resilient to different forms of technology,\u201d Przybylski says.\n\nWhat about Generation Z?\n\nTeenage media use has been a particular concern because of the ubiquity of smartphones today and because adolescence is such a formative period of development. In choosing what to worry about, parents have followed scientists\u2019 lead, says psychologist Candice Odgers of the University of California, Irvine. They worry mainly about how much time their children spend online without giving equal attention to the critical question of what they are doing there. Odgers\u2019s own work suggests that amount of use is not the problem. In a study published online this summer in Clinical Psychological Science, Odgers, Michaeline Jensen of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and their colleagues followed nearly 400 adolescents for two weeks, sending questions to the teenagers\u2019 cell phones three times a day. The study design allowed them to compare mental health symptoms and technology immersion daily as well as over the weeks of the study.\n\nWas media use associated with individual adolescents\u2019 well-being? The answer was not really. Routines in place at the start did not predict later mental health symptoms, and mental health was not worse on days teenagers reported spending more or less time on technology.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that in the end the real danger is not smartphones\u2014it\u2019s the level of misinformation that\u2019s being directed at the public and at parents,\u201d Odgers says. \u201cIt\u2019s consuming so much of the airtime that it\u2019s causing us to miss potentially some of the real threats and problems around digital spaces.\u201d For her part, Odgers is far more worried about privacy and unequal access to technology for kids from families with lower socioeconomic status. She also suspects that some adolescents find much needed social support online and that adults should pay closer attention to what works in that regard.\n\nSocial media 2.0\n\nThese studies are just the beginning. They have helped clarify the big picture on social media usage, but far more work is needed. Variety in the types of studies conducted will help tease out nuance. In a recent experimental study, for instance, Stanford\u2019s Gentzkow asked more than 1,600 people to deactivate their Facebook accounts, which was verified electronically. He and his colleagues were surprised that substitution of other digital technologies went down, not up. \u201cPeople perceive they\u2019re spending less time on all these things,\u201d Gentzkow says. The effect size was small, however, and masked a lot of individual variation. Some people loved the break; others really missed their online social world. \u201cFacebook is delivering a lot of value to people, but nevertheless they may be using it more than is really optimal for them,\u201d Gentzkow says. \u201cThere are many people for whom scaling back their usage a little could make them happier and better off.\u201d\n\nSeveral researchers are trying to better measure screen time. Stanford communications researcher Byron Reeves and his colleagues have developed a technique called Screenomics, which takes a picture of people\u2019s phones every five seconds (with permission). Technology companies also have a role to play. Corporations are better able than scientists to count how much time individuals are spending on different activities, but they consider that information proprietary, and there are privacy concerns for users to be addressed. Przybylski is pushing for that policy to change. \u201cCompanies shouldn\u2019t get a free pass,\u201d he says.\n\nNew research also seeks to do a better job of predicting individual variation. In Hancock\u2019s lab, Stanford undergraduate Angela Lee developed a creative approach. She applied the idea of mindsets\u2014that beliefs shape people\u2019s realities\u2014to social media. Through interviews, Lee found that views about social media fell into two general buckets: whether someone thought social media was good or bad for them (valence) and whether or not they thought they were in control of it (agency). Over the course of three studies, she and Hancock tested close to 700 people and found that social media mindsets predicted users\u2019 well-being. A sense of agency had the strongest effect. \u201cThe more you believe you are in control over your social media, the more social support you have, the less depression you report, the less stress, the less social anxiety, regardless of how much you\u2019re actually saying you use social media,\u201d says Lee, who is now a graduate student in Hancock\u2019s lab. She presented the work in May at the Association for Psychological Science meeting.\n\nThe power of mindset serves as a reminder of the power of perspective. In the 1980s people were wringing their hands about the time kids spent staring mindlessly at television screens, says Gentzkow, who has studied that era. He imagines asking those worrywarts about new technologies that would allow kids to instead interact with one another by sharing messages, photographs and videos. \u201cAnybody then would have said, \u2018Wow, that would be amazing.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Scientific American is the essential guide to the most awe-inspiring advances in science and technology, explaining how they change our understanding of the world and shape our lives.", "authors": ["Lydia Denworth", "Credit", "Nick Higgins"], "top_image": "https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/E002788D-4D6E-445B-85288791E71B468E.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
