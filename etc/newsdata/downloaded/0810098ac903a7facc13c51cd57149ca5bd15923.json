If they were a country, this group would be the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n\nThe rebels are led by California, which is locked in a battle with the president over his plans to repeal their powers to impose clean air standards.\n\nThe Trump effect\n\nSo far the biggest negative effect of Mr Trump\u2019s stance has arguably been to relax pressure on countries like Brazil and Saudi Arabia to take action of their own.\n\nEnvironmentalists say Mr Obama would have acted quickly to press Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro to tackle forest fires in the Amazon, for instance.\n\nMr Obama agreed in Paris that the US should take a lead on climate change because it\u2019s contributed far more than any other nation to the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A truck is loaded with coal at a mine near Cumberland, Kentucky\n\nChina - the current top emitter - and India still have relatively low per capita emissions, but Mr Trump said they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to phase out fossil fuels more slowly than the US.\n\nHe said: \"The Paris accord would have been shutting down American producers with excessive regulatory restrictions like you would not believe, while allowing foreign producers to pollute with impunity.\n\n\"What we won't do is punish the American people while enriching foreign polluters,\" he said, adding: \"I'm proud to say it - it's called America First.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch the moment Greta Thunberg saw US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit\n\nHis opponents warn the president is weakening US global leadership on the clean economy with technologies to boost wind and solar power, advanced batteries and energy conservation.\n\nNeera Tanden, from the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, said: \"Instead of projecting strength, this action weakens America on the world stage and cedes leadership on climate change and other challenges of our time to countries like Russia and China.\"\n\nIn fact, Chinese leadership on the issue has been muted recently as politicians there focus on avoiding a recession.\n\nA train wreck for US diplomacy\n\nThe Beijing government is having difficulty persuading provincial leaders to abandon coal plants for which they have taken heavy loans.\n\nIt\u2019s also committed to a massive airport-building programme to stimulate economic growth. Critics say this is incompatible with concern for the climate.\n\nAs extreme weather events alarm the world\u2019s scientists, diplomats will meet in a few weeks in Chile to figure out the path ahead.\n\nAndrew Light, a former State Department official during the Obama administration that helped broker the Paris agreement, said the formal withdrawal would make it difficult for the US to be part of the global conversation.\n\n\"It will take some time to recover from this train wreck of US diplomacy,\" he said.", "description": "Donald Trump says Paris deal would \"punish the American people\" as he hails US fossil fuel boom.", "authors": ["Roger Harrabin", "Bbc Environment Analyst"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p054n816.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
