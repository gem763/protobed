It was so bad that I managed to bash the back of my head as well.\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\n\"Parts of my skull shattered into my brain,\" Tracey, from Knowsley, Merseyside, said.\n\nDoctors operated on the mum at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth after the accident.\n\nShe spent the next eight weeks in a coma with her family by her side.\n\nRecalling the 2001 trauma, Tracy added: \"When I woke up I didn't remember a lot. I only know what happened to me because I was told.\n\n\"I couldn't speak after the accident. It was so strange. I didn't know whether it was a mental block that was stopping me from speaking. At the time I didn't know.\"\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nTracey was later transferred to Aintree Hospital where she began her rehabilitation.\n\nShe was sent to the Younger Rehabilitation Unit (YRU) where she worked on regaining the brain function she'd lost.\n\nShe said: \"I remember when my mum used to take me out a walk in my wheelchair while I was at the hospital.\n\n\"While I was at the YRU I basically learned to walk again. I worked with a physiotherapist for months to get to a point where I could walk unaided.\n\n\"It took me two months before I could walk again. I'm still a bit wary of walking long distances and places that I don't know.\n\n\"When I couldn't talk I had to scribble on a pad to answer questions but it was difficult because I couldn't write in sentences\n\n\"I had to learn to read again. I could read some things but not everything.\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\n\"I had a tracheostomy so I couldn't eat. They had to pulverise all my food. It took me three months to even eat properly again.\n\n\"The dent in my head used to pulsate before I had surgery. I had to have bone from the top of my skull grated on.\"\n\nShe also spoke about the long term impacts of her injury that still affect her to this day, saying: \"I have a lot of different health problems that stem back to the injury.\n\n\"I get double vision, I have no sense of smell, I developed epilepsy, and I have carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n\"When they had to cut the front of my head it also affected my emotions.\n\n\"Lots of things make me cry. They're often joyous things or ridiculous things.\n\n\"If someone sings to anyone it makes me cry. Sometimes the stupidest things on TV make me cry.\n\n\"My mum and the children call me 'tiny tears' because of it.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nTracey said the support of her loving family helped her through the darkest times, telling the ECHO: \"It was great to know that they were with me and they were there to make sure that nothing else happened to me.\n\n\"If it wasn't for my mum's determination I might not be here. The doctors asked her if she wanted to turn off my life support.\n\n\"But mum always told them that I was a fighter and that I'd pull through.\n\n\"My daughter was 10 at the time and my mum looked after her while I was in hospital.\n\n\"When I woke up I remember my auntie saying that dad was looking down on me from above. \"\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nTracey is baring the scars from her injury for the first time in a bid to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support by shaving her head at the Suites Hotel in Knowsley.\n\nIt's part of the charity's Brave The Shave campaign.\n\nShe said: \"It's a cause that's very important to me. All my mum's siblings died of cancer and I also lost a cousin to cancer.\n\n\"It seems that a lot of people are suffering and that's why I want to do this.\n\n\"It's a big moment for me. It's the first time since my accident that I'll be bearing my scars publicly.\n\n\"After the accident I was desperate to get my hair back. At the moment it's just passed my shoulders.\n\n\"In the past I never would have done anything like this. I love my hair but now I guess I'm not quite as vain as I used to be.\"", "description": "Tracey Wishart-Jones, of Knowsley, Merseyside, shattered part of her skull after tumbling down some steps", "authors": ["Max Clements", "Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Liverpool Echo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20575197.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JMP_LEC_041019TWISHARTJONES_001JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
