News was news. Sometimes frustrating. Sometimes uplifting. Sometimes a source of anger. Sometimes mundane. Remember boring? Those were the days.\n\nToday, not only do many stories trigger a welter of conflicting emotions, but recent developments also have conspired to push our reactions to unsettling, often unprecedented levels of intensity. We feel outrage, disgust, fear, dismay, sadness, contempt and, every so often, in the midst of it all, in the face of it all, inspiration and gratitude all at once and all \u201cturned up to 11.\u201d Nothing illustrates this quite so well as Tuesday's testimony of a hitherto faceless soldier, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman.\n\nUndermining national security\n\nVindman, a director at the National Security Council responsible for tracking U.S. relations with Ukraine, was disturbed that Trump and a handful of his emissaries were demanding that Ukraine\u2019s leaders investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's family and the 2016 election in exchange for receiving a White House meeting and aid that was vital to shoring up their defenses against the invading neighbor to their east, Russia. Vindman reported it both to the NSC legal counsel\u2019s office and his immediate boss, Senior Director Fiona Hill. Both she and her boss, national security adviser John Bolton, also tried to stop this.\n\nFollowing a July 10 effort by Gordon Sondland, ambassador the European Union, to pressure the Ukrainians, \u201cI stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push,\" Vindman said in his opening statement Tuesday behind closed doors. \"Dr. Hill then entered the room and asserted to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate.\u201d\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman arrives to testify before House committees on Oct. 29, 2019. (Photo: Shawn Thew/epa-EFE)\n\nUnlike previous witnesses, Vindman was cleared and listening in on Trump's call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25, and Vindman offered a firsthand account. It was, he testified, concerning: \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine. I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nSavaged for telling the truth\n\nVindman's testimony only further confirmed the presidential wrongdoing that had already been exposed in the White House\u2019s own summary of the call, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s admission of a quid pro quo and the testimony of nonpartisan, career public servants like acting Ukraine Ambassador Bill Taylor, Hill and even Trump donor Sondland, according to his lawyer.\n\nYet as soon as his damning testimony became known, Vindman was savaged without any basis in fact by Fox News and GOP operatives as being disloyal, potentially even a spy. Trump attacked him in a tweet and characterized him without evidence as a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d In so doing, he continued his long, infamous tradition of smearing those whose patriotism, values and service are above reproach, from Sen. John McCain to special counsel Robert Mueller to Democratic House leaders.\n\nHonorable until we speak up: Why I sued the Pentagon and wrote my book on Donald Trump and James Mattis\n\nThis one incident produces so many intense reactions. We cannot help but be deeply disturbed that once again, U.S. national security interests are subordinated to the personal interests of Trump and, as it happens, the national security objectives of Russia. And as we recently saw in the case of the Kurds, a close ally has again been abused and mistreated by a president with little grasp of history, global affairs or the meaning of alliances.\n\nCorruption but also inspiration\n\nOnce again, we see corruption twisting our foreign policy and then we see the partisanship of Republicans, seeking to protect their president, leading them to ignore the law, look the other way on vital issues of security and defend the gutting of national security and foreign policy processes.\n\nJust as bad, we see a president who never did one moment of public service in his life \u2014 who was a draft dodger and has been reasonably accused of not paying his fair share in taxes \u2014 lead a chorus of Republicans in attacking the integrity of yet another war hero, yet another dedicated public servant, yet another decent human being who risked his career because he thought it was so essential to our country to reveal the wrongdoing of his commander in chief.\n\nTrump in free fall:We need insights on the president's fitness from Mattis, Kelly and others in the know\n\nThat said, when we consider this last point, we cannot help but have an entirely different set of feelings. We are inspired. We are moved. We are grateful. We see the resilience of American democracy in the face of a coordinated multiyear attempt to undermine and debase it. We see the goodness and the contribution immigrants bring this country. We see the professionalism and patriotism of men and women like Vindman, Taylor, Hill and the others who have stood up to speak truth to power.\n\nThat is what happens in times of crisis. Our national character is tested. But more important, it is revealed. While the endgame of the series of abuses that has marked this presidency is unclear at this point, we cannot help but be made hopeful by the example of Vindman and the others. Perhaps, after all, this one incident offers us a sign that what this crisis will in the end reveal is a national character to be proud of and a system resilient enough to protect and ultimately, someday soon again, reflect it.\n\nDavid Rothkopf is CEO of the Rothkopf Group and host of Deep State Radio.
