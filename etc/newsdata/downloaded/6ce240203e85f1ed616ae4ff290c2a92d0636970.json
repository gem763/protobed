He also broke the 30-year-old Australian ranked 79 places below him three times in the match.\n\nDjokovic has already qualified for next month\u2019s season-ending ATP Finals in London.", "description": "World number one Novak Djokovic won his first Japan Open title and the 76th of his career with a dominant 6-3 6-2 win over Australian John Millman in the final in Tokyo on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437655555&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF95062-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
