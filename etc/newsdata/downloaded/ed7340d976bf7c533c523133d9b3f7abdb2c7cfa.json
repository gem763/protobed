Here\u2019s what makes them tick", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s the word on everyone\u2019s lips and in all the headlines: whistle-blower. (Seriously, look at how the word has trended on Google over just the last two weeks compared to the previous 15 years.)\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe anonymous CIA agent who filed a complaint about President Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is the latest and possibly most consequential example of a rare breed\u2014the low-level bureaucrat or citizen who learns about wrongdoing at their workplace or a government agency and alerts law enforcement or the public. It represents the best of citizenship, and is depicted heroically in the movies, but almost nobody would choose to be a whistle-blower. It can be a long and lonely and miserable existence. For instance, in the wake of the financial crisis, I had lunch with Harry Markopolos, the forensic accountant who spent years futilely alerting the Securities and Exchange Commission to the epic financial fraud committed by Bernie Madoff. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend being a whistle-blower to anyone\u2014you lose your job, your money, your family, your friends,\u201d he somberly intoned. \u201cYou get death threats. You\u2019ll never get a job again. It\u2019s awful.\u201d And yet whistle-blowers play a crucial role in maintaining checks and balances against corporate and government misconduct. From Revolutionary War seamen who accused the commander of the Continental Navy of torturing British prisoners to Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden, these brave Americans have exposed wrongdoing and helped grease the wheels of justice. Ideally, we shouldn\u2019t have any whistle-blowers\u2014because their very existence shows that the system isn\u2019t working. Their lone acts of bravura and truth-telling demonstrate that existing internal systems, whereby workers at corporations and government agencies can quietly raise concerns from within, aren\u2019t adequately addressing the problems or leading to reforms. Thus, they\u2019re compelled to blow the whistle, anonymously taking their claims to higher-ups or law enforcement or the media. As a result, the past few decades marked by corruption, corporate fraud, and national security paranoia have been a golden age for whistle-blowers, culminating in the Trump era. \u201cUnsurprisingly, the excesses of the Trump administration have triggered an unprecedented level of whistle-blowing and leaking,\u201d wrote Thomas Mueller in his new book, Crisis of Conscience: Whistleblowing in an Age of Fraud, a masterful, eye-opening account of heroes \u201cwho are fighting a rising tide of wrongdoing by the powerful.\u201d The number of leaks of classified information reported by federal agencies hit record levels during the first two years of the administration\u2014from 39 leaks per year under President Obama to 104 leak referrals per year in 2017 and 2018, notes Mueller. And whistle-blowers have emerged across many agencies, from the FBI and EPA to the IRS and Treasury.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn wide-ranging conversations with Fast Company, Mueller talked about the latest whistle-blower drama, the complicated personalities of the people who play that role, and the increasing challenges they face. This interview has been edited for clarity and concision. Fast Company: Tell me about what makes a whistle-blower\u2014what motivates someone to take action and speak out, given the resistance they\u2019ll face and how their lives will be upended forever. Thomas Mueller: For a lot of the people that I talked with, and I talked to 200 plus, they didn\u2019t really have a choice. They would love to have avoided it if they could have. That was a cup they had to lift and drink from. There wasn\u2019t an option for them. I heard so many times people say, \u2018I have to live with myself\u2019 or \u2018I had to look myself in the mirror.\u2019 Sort of trite things, but you begin to get goose bumps when you hear them because you realize these people really mean it. I could say it. You could say it. But we have our point where we say, \u2018Ah, fuck it, let\u2019s go with this.\u2019 But they don\u2019t and they know what\u2019s coming down the pike most of the time. So, it\u2019s inspiring to hear these people. These are individual stories of people who, against all odds\u2014which are not inconsiderable given that they\u2019re taken on multibillion-dollar companies and powerful governments\u2014they said, \u201cNo, no, no. I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d And that\u2019s a good message in this day and age right now. FC: What are the ingredients that really make up a whistle-blower? Because obviously there are many people who don\u2019t rock the boat. Most people have a conscience and are aware that something is wrong, whether they\u2019re working at a hog farm or a hedge fund. But what prompts them to actually take that step. That\u2019s key. You can think about it and talk about it and complain about it to your husband or wife. But what makes you take all those steps to actually blow the whistle? TM: That\u2019s the million-dollar question, isn\u2019t it? There are a few characteristics that I ran into that seem to be recurrent themes. Sampling error may be a problem for me because I didn\u2019t do it randomly. I only dealt with people who went public. One of the things I did early on was I said, well, these are only the nuclear scenarios where things go horribly wrong, right? You know, the person finds a problem, they try to raise it within the company or within the organization, and it doesn\u2019t work. And then everything blows up and they go public and there\u2019s a lawsuit and it lasts for 10 years\u2014and that\u2019s when I heard about it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut there are a lot of times when someone goes to their boss and says, \u201cHey, I think this is broken.\u201d And she says, \u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019ve got to fix that.\u201d And they fix it and it goes away. So what I tried to do at the beginning was to go to organizations and say, \u201cLook, can you give me your success stories of internal reporting, where things went well.\u201d And they said, \u201cNo fucking way.\u201d They\u2019re not totally junior. And they\u2019re not extremely senior, with the exception of [Pentagon Papers whistle-blower] Daniel Ellsberg. They\u2019re typically fairly senior and they have to have enough time in the industry to have confidence that their call is the right call and their boss\u2019s call was the wrong call. They typically have a support system externally like their wife or husband, a family member or someone who says, \u2018Do the right thing.\u2019 FC: So they\u2019re not total loners who are off on their own. TM: No, but on the other hand, they\u2019re not go-along-to-get-along people. They\u2019re not the life-of-the-party people. They\u2019re independent enough and maybe even prickly enough. A lot of people would say to me, \u201cI\u2019m a rules kind of girl. I believe in black and white.\u201d It\u2019s not the utilitarian. It\u2019s the virtue ethics or the ontological approach to things\u2014\u201dThis is right because it\u2019s right. And this is wrong because it\u2019s wrong. Not because I\u2019m going to do some calculation to figure out that in the long run, sure we may kill a few people with this drug, but it\u2019s going to save millions of lives.\u201d A lot of people think that way and these people don\u2019t. They say, \u201cNo, this is causing human harm.\u201d Another thing that I saw again and again was the ability to pierce the veil of statistics, of marketing spiel, and to see the actual victims of what you\u2019re doing. Whether that\u2019s someone in a clinical trial or someone in a financial relationship where they\u2019re getting taken to the cleaners. They see past the spreadsheet to the individuals who are getting harmed\u2014and they\u2019re not good with it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnd so often they use language that makes you think that they\u2019re identifying with victims in a very personal way. They say, \u201cWhat if that was your mother? How would you feel if you found out this hospital was doing unnecessary back surgeries and that was your mother?\u201d And a lot of people were just\u2014get with the numbers, hit your quotas, milestones, bonus, year-end party, and repeat. They were on for the ride. And that\u2019s the way most people operate in a group, especially. And they were able to fairly early on defuse the group thing and say, \u201cNo, no, no. You guys got it wrong. This is just unacceptable.\u201d And it sometimes seems kind of old-fashioned. Again and again, I found that these people grew up in small towns where everybody knew everybody. You couldn\u2019t really pull a fast one because you know Aunt Sally was, was watching. You threw a rock and broke a window. People were gonna know. Your actions have consequences. It\u2019s also certain fields like healthcare, nuclear safety, engineering, where there\u2019s a very strong professional ethics. Nuclear engineers would say to me, \u201cI swore a holy oath to protect the public because if this thing goes wrong, millions of people could die.\u201d So it\u2019s not optional. FC: So, there are those who follow their ethical compass and those who follow the administrative rules of their workplace. And most people just do what their boss tells them. TM: I had a chapter in this book, which was taken out in the end, about so-called failed whistle-blowers. People who didn\u2019t quite make the grade, for whatever reason. There was one guy who told me a story about his inability to blow the whistle on the DOJ. He was an expert witness in the tobacco trials. And the DOJ under Bush came in and they pressured him to change his testimony and to downplay certain things that he had said.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnd he went along with it because he trusted the people that he was working with. And he thought it was for the good of the team. And then weeks later he read an article in the newspaper in which another person who had been pressured blew the whistle. And he said, \u201cOh, my God.\u201d He said it was a horrible moment in his life because he realized he had missed that opportunity to speak up. Not because he didn\u2019t believe it, not because he wasn\u2019t a good person. It just, there was un-clarity of the situation. He was busy. There were other things going on. He trusted that and he just moved on. And I think that\u2019s very important, too, to understand. These people, they\u2019re not good with just objecting internally. They\u2019re not good with resigning and finding another job. They say, \u201cNo, this is wrong. And not only is it wrong, I\u2019m going to do what it takes to stop it.\u201d They\u2019re actually going to speak out loudly and at great risk. They know that that risk is coming. So, it\u2019s clarity of thought, wherever that comes from. And again, these people are not necessarily nice or heroes. It\u2019s sort of a disservice to whistle-blowers, who get this saint or sinner dichotomy that people try to apply to them. And that\u2019s wrong because they may be jerks. It\u2019s important that they have good facts. Many of the people I dealt with were really fine people, but they might\u2019ve been tough as office mates. They really are rules people. FC: It sounds like we\u2019re in a golden era for whistle-blowing, over the last 10 years, so even before Trump. What is it about what\u2019s happening in society and in the U.S. that\u2019s made it such a time for whistle-blowers to be more visible and more active? TM: Widespread corruption and loss of values. I don\u2019t want to sound like a reactionary, but these people would time and time again say to me, \u201cI hate the term whistle-blower. I was just doing my job. I was paid as a compliance person to call out problems and educate people as to what fraud is. And I was doing that and they crushed me.\u201d It\u2019s a comment on our times that we need a special term, kind of a weird term, and a whole bunch of weird laws for people who are just doing their fricking jobs, right? Just calling out wrongdoing within the organization with the perhaps naive idea that it\u2019ll hurt the reputation of their organization. Because so many times they thought, \u201cHey, everyone\u2019s going to be really glad that I pointed this out because, wow, we\u2019d have a lot of egg on our face if this got out. Little did they know that this was a feature, not a bug, the plan was baked in. But they didn\u2019t get it. And then gradually they got it, of course, but only after the pink slip had arrived.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a comment on where we are in society. Look at the guy in the White House, he\u2019s the absolute prime mover and enabler of all the worst things in America\u2019s ethical collapse. FC: How much has technological innovation play a role? I\u2019m thinking back to the Gilded Age and you could say that arguably there was more corruption back then\u2014or at least a similar level of corruption. Were there a lot of whistle-blowers back then or was it that it wasn\u2019t as easy to become a whistle-blower because you couldn\u2019t go on Twitter, you couldn\u2019t go and write a blog, you couldn\u2019t send an email to all these organizations we have now that keep on top of these things? TM: Well, it\u2019s a double-edged sword. On the one hand, technology enables investigative projects like the Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers\u2014download I don\u2019t how many terabytes of data of dirty dealings and beam that to the Suddeutsche Zeitung. And that\u2019s magnificent and that, that is incredibly good. On the other hand, anybody in the NSA or anybody in the intelligence industry is going to go to jail if they blow the whistle because the technology has turned against them. And even if they follow the rules that were laid down by [Edward] Snowden in Citizenfour of how to do this [become a whistle-blower without going to jail], they\u2019re already out of date. The spooks have caught up and they know how to do this. If you download a file, or use a flash drive, they\u2019re going to find out. There are these insider threat programs, which theoretically are to prevent leaks, but they\u2019re really to catch whistle-blowers. FC: Back during the financial scandals of the 1920s, were there whistle-blowers who worked at JPMorgan and other banks and shared tales of malfeasance and misdeeds? TM: I don\u2019t know the answer to that. I do know that there really weren\u2019t the laws in place to protect people back then. There are today to a large extent and they \u201cprotect,\u201d at least nominally . . . At the end of the day, you lose your career. And this is for me the ultimate indictment of the way we look at whistle-blowers\u2014we\u2019re glad for them, we cheer them in the movies, everyone gets a nice warm feeling, and they forget that in real life these people are permanently unemployed. They never work again. And to me, if someone saves a thousand lives with the FAA and they never are employed again, that\u2019s a problem. That points out why whistle-blowing shouldn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s a bad sign for our basic ethical framework. You can\u2019t allow the industry to put these people out of work forever. If the system worked properly and had the right safeguards, we wouldn\u2019t need whistle-blowers. FC: Now I wanted to ask you about the big story of the day. Would you consider this CIA agent who alerted the inspector general about Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky a true whistle-blower?\n\nadvertisement\n\nTM: Oh, absolutely. This is a government official going through official channels, and making an official whistle-blower complaint. It says it right on the form, \u201cwhistle-blower complaint.\u201d And the inspector general looks at this complaint and considers whether it is credible and urgent and if it is by law, the language is it \u201cshall\u201d be transmitted to Congress within seven days. It\u2019s not optional. And this complaint was stranded in political no man\u2019s land by [Attorney General] Barr and company. They were breaking the law. In the book, I go through how this happens time and time again and the wrong signals are sent. This is a broken system. It\u2019s not a whistle-blower facilitator. It\u2019s a whistle-blower trap. And if you want to get the word out, you better go abroad and be prepared to spend the rest of your life abroad. I mean those are the stakes right there. FC: This has to be great timing for your book, on top of all the stories about the Snowden book that came out a few weeks ago. TM: It\u2019s extraordinarily lucky. It\u2019s a slender silver lining in a really black cloud hanging over our head. In the seven years I\u2019ve looked at this subject, I have really gone through periods of deep depression. What was unnerving to me is the mechanism of retaliation, the mechanism of corruption, the melding of public and private, but also the culture of secrecy and the cult of money. All these things are common denominators that appear again and again. FC: What can be done to better protect whistle-blowers or make it easier for them to come forward, and then secondly, what are the structural changes that would prevent the need for whistle-blowers? TM: What we need in the government realm is access to jury trials, not going through political choke points like the director of national intelligence who was a political appointee. This has become essentially a totally politicized civil service. This is stuff we went through with Nixon. And we need laws that make whistle-blowers report directly to Congress. More broadly, I think we need to rethink what patriotism and treason really mean. To stop and look this in the eye and ask, what is really being a good citizen?\n\nadvertisement\n\nFC: Lately, I\u2019ve seen it in Silicon Valley, where for a long time there was this culture of extreme loyalty and this misplaced optimism about the benefits of technology. And now you\u2019re seeing this crisis of conscience, where people in the tech sector are coming forward and talking about projects at Google and Amazon and elsewhere that they think are harmful. TM: At the end of the day, these structures are getting basically good people to do bad things. They have gotten sucked up into this loyalty and obedience trap and they need to do a reset. To realize that being an American means being a square shooter and looking after the little guy. Not cozying up to the money. That\u2019s why I think most of the people who do bad things are perfectly good people that have gone tone-deaf on conscience, and that needs to be front and center. And that\u2019s what whistle-blowers remind us. That little voice, that little sickness in your stomach when you do that? You need to pay more attention to that.", "description": "Thomas Mueller spent seven years researching and interviewing whistle-blowers for his new book \u2018Crisis of Conscience.\u2019 And it couldn\u2019t have landed at a better time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2019/10/p-1-this-author-has-interviewed-hundreds-of-whistleblowers-hereand8217s-what-makes-them-tick.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
