Did not exist in the 60\u2019s. They grew exponentially from the 60\u2019s to where we are now,\u201d said Donald McGovern, in the final episode of the Fox Nation series, \u201cScandalous: The Death of Marilyn Monroe.\u201d\n\nMcGovern, author of \u201cMurder Orthodoxies: A Non-Conspiracist's View of Marilyn Monroe's Death,\u201d is just one of several experts featured in the new episode, which re-examines a secret plot to pin blame for the Hollywood icon\u2019s death on the then-U.S. Attorney General and brother of the President, Bobby Kennedy.\n\nMONROE'S ICONIC COSTUMES UP FOR AUCTION\n\nWhat these plotters could not know at the time was that their activities would give rise to decades of conspiracies that continue to this day.\n\nThe documentary details how a right-wing writer, the head of an anti-Communist group, and the first police officer to arrive on the scene of Monroe\u2019s death conspired to point the finger at Kennedy.\n\nA key player in the cabal was Maurice Reis, who was the president of The Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals.\n\n\u201cReis accused the Writers Guild of fostering a Communist invasion into Hollywood in 1950. He kept dossiers on many stars one of which was Marilyn,\u201d said McGovern.\n\nThe three conspirators met in the months after Monroe\u2019s death, and according to McGovern, \u201cthat\u2019s when they first got the story from Reis about the Kennedy-Marilyn involvement.\u201d\n\nThe show delves into the plan to push the narrative that Monroe did not die of a drug overdose, as the coroner had concluded, but that she was killed on orders from Kennedy.\n\nCentral to this scheme was the involvement of one very powerful New York gossip columnist.\n\nBLANCA BLANCO STRIPS DOWN FOR 60-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF 'SOME LIKE IT HOT'\n\n\u201cWalter Winchell serialized what essentially was a theory. That Bobby Kennedy and Marilyn had had an affair and that Bobby Kennedy had Marilyn murdered. I don\u2019t know that Winchell ever comes out and says that. But it\u2019s insinuated,\u201d recounted McGovern.\n\nThe theories surrounding Monroe did not end there. They re-surfaced in the 1970\u2019s, around the 10th anniversary of her death, when novelist Norman Mailer wrote an instant best-selling book, \u201cMarilyn: A Biography.\u201d\n\nIn the final chapter of that book, Mailer turns the Capell-Reis-Clemmons conspiracy on its head and suggests that Monroe was killed by the conspirators.\n\nWatch the season finale of \u201cScandalous: The Death of Marilyn Monroe,\u201d this Sunday night at 8 p.m. Eastern and Pacific on the Fox News Channel.
