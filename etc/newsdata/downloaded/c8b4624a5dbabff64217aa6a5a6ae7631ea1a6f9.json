This is reckless. You don\u2019t have to take the position to win the primary and you\u2019re basically, literally hindering yourself for the general election.\u201d\n\nBongino joked that he has almost never agreed with Emanuel, but the Democrats' argument on health care goes against basic economics.\n\n\"The very bedrock of economics is the allocation of scarce resources. A doctor's time and hospital beds are scarce resources. You can either price them or you can ration them,\" he said.\n\nSALLY PIPES: BERNIE'S 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' MEANS WORSE INSURANCE AT HIGHER COST FOR MOST AMERICANS\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBongino said government-run health care can only lead to \"rationing,\" similar to other single-payer health care systems like the United Kingdom, and Americans will reject it.\n\n\"If you instill a rationing system, Rahm Emanuel is right, it will be economic and political suicide for the Democratic Party.\"", "description": "Fox News contributor Dan Bongino expressed agreement Monday on \"Fox & Friends\" with former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who warned 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are going too far left on health care and immigration.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Bongino-Rahm.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
