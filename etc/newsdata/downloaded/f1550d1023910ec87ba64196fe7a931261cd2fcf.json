They go directly to the state, which, depending on its policies, either keeps it all or passes through a percentage of it. What happens next varies from state to state. Let\u2019s say that the father actually sends the state his child support payment (the Office of Child Support Enforcement in the federal Department of Health and Human Services says only 66 percent of support due in the 2018 fiscal year was collected). In more than half of the states, all of that money essentially disappears, at least as far as poor families are concerned; it\u2019s absorbed into the system, seen as \u201cpayback\u201d for the welfare system that is supporting the child.\n\nIn other states, a state child support payment, usually around $50 and amounting to a small portion of what a parent paid in, is passed on to the child and his or her family. The rest, again, is absorbed by the state. Only two states \u2014 Colorado and Minnesota \u2014 pass the full amount of the support through to the custodial parent and child.\n\nAnother twist: In some states, that $50 is counted as income, and can push the custodial parent, usually a mother struggling to make ends meet, out of the range of eligibility for TANF entirely. (In other states, the \u201cpass-through\u201d money, as it\u2019s known, is not counted as income.)\n\nTo look up your state, see here.\n\nNow what happens if the noncustodial parent can\u2019t pay?\n\nA domino effect of penalties \u2014 again, varying from state to state \u2014 is set into motion. If the noncustodial parent, usually a father, is employed, his paycheck can be garnished. If he has a driver\u2019s license, it can be taken away. Debt accrues. His credit score plummets. In many states, he is charged interest on the debt; in California, for example, that rate is 10 percent.", "description": "When states take over managing child support, watch out. Most of the money paid in by parents often disappears into state coffers. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way.", "authors": ["Courtney E.
