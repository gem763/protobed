The team has historic, near-perfect gender balance, with women holding 13 of 27 positions. And it has portfolio assignments designed to tackle urgent policy challenges, though some with absurdly aspirational, even pompous names that will do little to counter the EU\u2019s reputation for haughtiness.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, of Denmark, will be executive vice president for \u201cEurope fit for the Digital Age,\u201d while Valdis Dombrovskis, a former Latvian prime minister and current Commission vice president, will become executive vice president for \u201cAn Economy that Works for People.\u201d As opposed to for pets, perhaps. Or for aliens.\n\nTimmermans will be in charge of a \u201cEuropean Green Deal\u201d aimed at ramping up EU policy to fight climate change and push sustainability.\n\nLofty ambitions notwithstanding, von der Leyen\u2019s nominees must be confirmed by the European Parliament \u2014 and some of them will face tough scrutiny over allegations of misconduct. That includes Sylvie Goulard of France, who was interviewed by French police on Tuesday in a case involving misuse of EU funds; Rovana Plumb of Romania, who was implicated in a corruption case in 2017; and Poland\u2019s Janusz Wojciechowski, who is under investigation by the EU\u2019s anti-fraud office.\n\nIn all there will be eight Commission vice presidents \u2014 three executive VPs, with one, Frans Timmermans of the Netherlands, designated as \u201cfirst vice president\u201d to serve in von der Leyen\u2019s absence, and five more vice presidents, meaning roughly two commissioners per VP.\n\nAnnouncing the team, von der Leyen insisted that rank and seniority were not her priorities.\n\n\u201cWe have a structure that focuses on tasks, not hierarchies,\u201d von der Leyen told reporters at the Commission headquarters. \u201cWe need to be able to deliver on the issues that matter the most, rapidly and with determination.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want this European Commission to be a flexible, modern, agile Commission,\u201d she said, at another point calling it a \u201cgeopolitical Commission\u201d and a \u201cguardian of multilateralism.\u201d\n\nVon der Leyen\u2019s nominees include a dozen women \u2014 a leap forward from the current Commission, which has eight women, and a seismic shift for the EU\u2019s executive body, which from 1985 to 1988 had no women at all.\n\nSuch grand responsibilities as serving the European way of life also come with more mundane rewards: if confirmed, the commissioners stand to earn a base salary of at least \u20ac270,000 per year, plus allowances, with officials in senior roles earning more.\n\nAnd despite the obvious risk of appearing to have more leaders than followers \u2014 hardly a new challenge for the EU and its five cross-institutional presidents \u2014 the assignments proposed by von der Leyen also reflected some breathtakingly ambitious policy goals.\n\nTimmermans will be in charge of a \u201cEuropean Green Deal\u201d aimed at ramping up EU policy to fight climate change and push sustainability.\n\nVestager, in turn, will not only become the bloc\u2019s digital czar but will retain her current position as competition commissioner, continuing a role overseeing the EU\u2019s anti-trust regulations that brought her to global prominence and even drew criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, who derisively referred to her as the \u201ctax lady.\u201d\n\nIn stark contrast with the Juncker Commission, women hold many of the most powerful posts and prominent portfolios.\n\nThese include V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 of the Czech Republic, who will be vice president for values and transparency; Goulard, who as a former French defense minister will take a broad internal market portfolio and oversee a new directorate general covering defense, industry and space; Croatia\u2019s Dubravka \u0160uica, a former mayor of Dubrovnik, as vice president for democracy and demography; and Kadri Simson, of Estonia, as energy commissioner.\n\nFormer Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni will be commissioner for economy, while Didier Reynders, currently the Belgian foreign minister, will take Jourov\u00e1's place as justice commissioner.\n\nThe selection of Jourov\u00e1, representing one of the Visegrad Four nations of Central and Eastern Europe, carries special significance given still-simmering tensions between Brussels and two of the V4 grouping, Poland and Hungary, over protections for rule of law and democracy.\n\nIn a statement, Jourov\u00e1, who is currently the EU justice commissioner, said she relished the new role. \u201cMy memories of communism are too vivid to be complacent about challenges to fundamental freedoms, plurality of media or the rule of law,\u201d she said, adding that threats to democracy could be found in many forms.\n\n\u201cThrough my experience from the last five years I am very alarmed about new threats for democracy stemming from lack of transparency in the digital age or from foreign election manipulation, including through disinformation campaigns and misuse of personal data,\" she said, adding: \"This is a great opportunity to unite Europe and build bridges between East and West, North and South.\u201d\n\nVon der Leyen also seemed to send a pointed message to the U.K. by nominating Phil Hogan, of Ireland, to be trade commissioner. Hogan, who is highly regarded for his work as the EU\u2019s current agriculture commissioner, is likely to sail through the confirmation process, making him the face across the negotiating table if and when the U.K. is able to accomplish Brexit and begin talks over a new EU trade agreement.\n\nAmong the other men on von der Leyen's team, Josep Borrell, currently the Spanish foreign minister, will be high representative for foreign affairs \u2014 a decision that was made by the European Council at the same time leaders chose von der Leyen for the presidency.\n\nFormer Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni will be commissioner for economy, while Didier Reynders, currently the Belgian foreign minister, will take Jourov\u00e1's place as justice commissioner.\n\nShaking things up\n\nBy proposing eight vice presidents, including three executive VPs, von der Leyen will undoubtedly face questions about whether she has created a College with too many bosses \u2014 particularly after her decision to create a third executive vice presidency for Dombrovskis, something that was not envisioned by EU leaders when they named von der Leyen president in July.\n\nLeaders specified executive slots for Timmermans, a social democrat, and the liberal Vestager as part of a carefully calibrated leadership package intended to balance out the conservative European People\u2019s Party's hold on the Commission presidency.\n\nBut in response to a question from POLITICO, von der Leyen noted that the Council had not appointed any official from Central or Eastern Europe to the EU\u2019s senior leadership \u2014 and she had acted to address this by elevating Dombrovskis.\n\nShe took personal credit for having achieved \u201cabsolutely the right balance\u201d between political affiliation and geography.\n\nNoting the Council\u2019s nominations of herself for the Commission, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel as Council President, Borrell for high representative of foreign affairs, and Timmermans and Vestager, she said, \u201cI am talking about five decisions that have been taken without any representation of Central and Eastern European countries ... It was very important for me to find a balance as I showed on the map.\u201d\n\nShe went on to note that the presidents of the Commission, Council and Parliament each represented one of the main, pro-EU political groups, the center-right EPP, the center-left Socialists and Democrats, and the liberal Renew Europe group, and that each party had one executive vice president in the Commission.\n\n\u201cAs a president, I'm free to decide,\u201d von der Leyen said. \u201cThat's what I did.\u201d\n\nVon der Leyen\u2019s proposed College of Commissioners effectively scrambles positions and portfolios to focus far more on policy themes than on mirroring the Commission's departments (known as directorate generals).\n\nOf all the creative and unusual titles that von der Leyen proposed, perhaps the most intriguing was that of vice president for \u201cprotecting our European way of life,\u201d assigned to Margaritis Schinas, the Greek nominee and former chief spokesman for the Juncker Commission, who said he was \"thrilled\" to be nominated for the vice presidency.\n\nVon der Leyen explained that Schinas would be in charge of migration \u2014 which includes one of the EU's most intractable policy disputes over how to revise the bloc's asylum rules.\n\nThat caused immediate consternation as some members of Parliament quickly objected to the apparent implication.\n\nWhile some questions during the news conference focused on von der Leyen's broader goals for the EU, many focused on the individual nominees.\n\n\u201cCalling the European Commission migration portfolio \u2018protecting our way of life\u2019 is deeply insulting,\u201d Claude Moraes, a British MEP, wrote on Twitter. \"Any idea how this comes across?\" he asked in a second outraged tweet.\n\nThat said, if anyone can spin the concept, it might be Schinas, a veteran Commission official and former MEP who has served as Juncker's chief spokesman and the EU's chief message architect.\n\nUnder pressure\n\nTuesday\u2019s news conference was, by far, von der Leyen\u2019s longest public appearance since her confirmation by Parliament in July.\n\nShe fielded questions comfortably in English, French and German, demonstrating that multilingualism remains a core asset for senior EU officials. Her only complaint was that some reporters asked so many questions, sometimes with multiple parts, that she could not always keep track of them all and had to start scribbling notes.\n\nWhile some questions focused on von der Leyen's broader goals for the EU, many focused on the individual nominees. Von der Leyen faced several questions about Wojciechowski, nominated as agriculture commissioner, concerning the ongoing OLAF investigation.\n\nVon der Leyen said the investigation was independent and would run its course, but it could not have been a particularly comfortable question for the president-elect, who is still under investigation herself by the German parliament over allegations of mismanagement and misspending during her tenure as defense minister.\n\nThere may be some sense of safety in numbers. With concerns immediately raised about the suitability of Plumb, the EU\u2019s anti-fraud office OLAF also confirmed to POLITICO on Tuesday that an investigation into Goulard \u201cis still ongoing.\u201d", "description": "First woman selected for EU\u2019s top post announces portfolios.", "authors": ["David M.
