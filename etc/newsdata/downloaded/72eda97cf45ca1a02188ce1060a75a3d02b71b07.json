Squabble To Regulate Big Tech Leaves Americans In the Dust", "language": "en", "text": "The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com.\n\nTwo federal agencies are talking past each other as they rush to investigate Big Tech, creating a situation that has become more confusing than Abbott and Costello\u2019s famous \u201cWho\u2019s on First?\u201d baseball skit. Real life, unfortunately, is no laughing matter, but one senator is making an effort to determine how the power squabble between the Department of Justice (DOJ)\u2019s Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) could be harmful to consumers and taxpayers.\n\nThis week, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, is holding a hearing on \u201cOversight of the Enforcement of the Antitrust Laws.\u201d His two witnesses are FTC Chairman Joseph Simons and Assistant Attorney General (AG) for the DOJ\u2019s Antitrust Division Makan Delrahim.\n\nPresumably, Chairman Simons and Assistant AG Delrahim will have to answer questions on why their two agencies are waging a tug-of-war over investigating four Big Tech companies: Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon. The Wall Street Journal found that DOJ\u2019s July announcement, saying it would review \u201cwhether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power,\u201d caught FTC senior staff by surprise.\n\nThe Journal also reported that the DOJ move \u201cmuddled aspects of an agreement the two sides had reached just a few weeks earlier\u201d to split up Big Tech investigations. Under this tentative arrangement, DOJ would have investigated Google and Apple while the FTC pursued Facebook and Amazon.\n\nTo invoke another sports metaphor, anyone who has played basketball knows the headaches that can emerge when two players fighting for the ball happen to be no the same team. The FTC claims that \u201c[i]n some respects [the] authorities [of FTC and DOJ\u2019s Antitrust Division] overlap, but in practice the two agencies complement each other.\u201d\n\nOne just needs to look a bit further than FTC\u2019s website to see that, in practice, these overlapping authorities actually breed resentment between agencies, confusion for businesses and consumers, and wasteful spending borne by taxpayers.\n\nFortunately, Sen. Lee has been on top of this issue for some time. When DOJ made their July investigation announcement, the senator wrote that the news \u201chighlights the absurdity of having two federal agencies responsible for civil antitrust enforcement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile it is laudable that our antitrust enforcers are seeking to root out potential anticompetitive conduct in the tech industry, their duplicative reviews will inevitably waste government resources and lead to the agencies taking contradictory positions on the same issues,\" Lee said. \"Moreover, without clear guidance, dual enforcement will leave industry in confusion as to what to expect from regulators or even what laws will specifically apply to their operations.\u201d\n\nThe Utah senator hit the nail on the head earlier in the year, though, when he wrote, \u201cNevertheless, many of the calls to use antitrust law to address these issues are misplaced, and I\u2019m worried that, in the rush to address our collective concerns about tech, we risk undermining the soundness and impartiality of antitrust enforcement.\u201d\n\nConsumers and taxpayers are best served by a \u201clight-touch\u201d approach to antitrust enforcement, whether at DOJ or FTC. There are legitimate roles for policymakers to play when it comes to protecting consumers\u2019 privacy rights, policing unfair business practices, and ensuring the market for innovative products remains competitive and robust. However, none of these important debates should serve as an excuse for excessive big-government intervention in an industry, led by American companies, that has brought unique and helpful products to billions of people.\n\nRegulators should operate with prudence and restraint, rather than pursue overzealous, race-to-the-bottom investigations that would not look out of place in a Warren administration. Sen. Lee\u2019s hearing should be a good start to re-examining the steps that regulators have taken so far - and to avoiding an alphabet soup of agency duplication worthy of Abbott and Costello.", "description": "Two federal agencies are talking past each other as they .09/17/2019 4:22:55AM EST.", "authors": ["Andrew Lautz", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/305/f421fba0-25dd-4de9-b9b2-a9e01e63293c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
