BTC may perhaps accelerate decline as long as there is no close above the $10,400 and $10,500 levels.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nIn the last two analysis, we discussed the chances of more downsides in bitcoin price below $10,400 against the US Dollar. The price broke the $10,250 support area and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Moreover, the recent decline was such that the price broke the $10,100 support area. Finally, there was a downside spike below the $10,000 level and a new swing low was formed near the $9,938.\n\nRecently, there was an upside correction above the $10,000 level. Moreover, the price broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent slide from the $10,528 high to $9,938 low. However, the upward move was capped by the $10,200 and $10,250 levels. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $10,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\n\nAdditionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent slide from the $10,528 high to $9,938 low is acting as a resistance for the bulls. Above the trend line, the next key resistance is near the $10,350 level and the 100 hourly SMA. Having said that, a successful close above the $10,400 level plus the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent slide from the $10,528 high to $9,938 low is needed for more gains.\n\nOn the downside, the $10,000 level is an immediate support. However, the main support is near the $9,950 level. Below $9,950, there are chances of further losses in the near term. The next key support is near the $9,800 level.\n\nLooking at the chart, bitcoin price is clearly under pressure and it could continue to slide below $10,000 in the coming sessions. If there is a bearish break below the $9,950 level, the price could head towards the $9,800 level. The main pivot level is near the $9,500 level.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is still moving in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is well below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $10,000 followed by $9,950.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $10,200, $10,250 and $10,350.", "description": "Bitcoin price is under pressure below $10,250 against the US Dollar.
