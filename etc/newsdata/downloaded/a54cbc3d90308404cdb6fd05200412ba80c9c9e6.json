This is not a sketch. Just as Magritte played with traditional conventions of words, images and meaning, so modern politics works in reverse. The surreal has become fully integrated back into the real. So much so, it\u2019s almost impossible to distinguish between the two. If a train were to emerge from one of the fireplaces inside Westminster palace, no one would bat an eyelid. Other than to express surprise that it was on time. Chris Grayling\u2019s legacy lives on. The sketch has become more or less straightforward reporting.\n\nThere was a time when prime ministers took their responsibilities seriously. When an appearance before the liaison committee \u2013 the supergroup of chairs of all select committees \u2013 was an ordeal set in stone. No prime minister enjoyed being asked difficult questions to which they often had to evade the answer, but the session was understood to be part of the job.\n\nBoris Johnson sees things rather differently. He knows he can\u2019t survive 15 minutes of forensic questioning, let alone a full two hours, so with barely 12 hours\u2019 notice he cancelled his Thursday morning date with the liaison committee. For the third time. Rather than a formal apology or explanation, he merely scribbled a quick note to Sarah Wollaston, the committee chair, on a crumpled sheet of paper.\n\n\u201cSoz I can\u2019t be there,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s been a busy week and I could do without the hassle. I rather fancy taking Dilyn for a walk instead. Maybe I\u2019ll come and see you in five or six months if I can be arsed. And either of us are a still in a job. Ring my people to fix a date that I can later miss. Yours, whateva.\u201d Classic Dom high-fived him \u2013 what was the point of regaining UK sovereignty only to waste it on democratic processes? \u2013 before pissing in the waste paper basket. Toilets were for wimps.\n\nThe clear-up process took up most of the day. First, Stephen Barclay had to answer an urgent question on customs declarations between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain, after the prime minister had insisted there wouldn\u2019t be any.\n\n\u201cUm, er,\u201d said the Brexit secretary. Well there would be some forms, he mumbled, and there would be extra expense and delay. But if everyone just worked a bit harder, reduced their prices by \u00a355 and dispatched the goods across the border 30 minutes earlier, no one would notice the difference. Try not to think of it as border checks so much as an opportunity to get to know the people working at HMRC a little better. Barclay\u2019s know-nothing shtick isn\u2019t an affectation. He genuinely does know nothing. It\u2019s been the secret to his political survival.\n\nNext up was Jacob Rees-Mogg, the idiot\u2019s idea of a thinking man, to provide details of the Commons\u2019 business for the coming week. \u201cThe government is committed to leaving the EU on October 31st,\u201d he smirked. And how was it planning to do this? By debating the environmentally friendly way to give a cockapoo a haircut and introducing legislation to force the French to drive on the left-hand side of the road. That way there might be fewer delays at Calais post Brexit.\n\nOf the withdrawal agreement bill there was no sign. \u201cThey seek it here, they seek it there,\u201d Rees-Mogg laughed, working himself up into a state of visible arousal at his own Divine Comedy. For a man who used to pride himself on his sincerity and probity, lying and S&M cosplay have become second nature. He must have a very accommodating arrangement with the priest at confession.\n\nFinally, we arrived at the tail end of the Queen\u2019s speech debate. Normally an occasion of high drama but now, thanks to the government\u2019s total dysfunctionality, a mere sideshow. John McDonnell used his speech to lament the lack of any economic impact assessments of the new Brexit deal \u2013 other than the independent ones that showed the country being 8% worse off.\n\nSajid Javid was outraged. The deal was so self-evidently good that no impact assessments were required. Besides, he had had an email from a Nigerian prince saying the country would be \u00a3350bn better off per week. All the government had to do was send details of the Treasury\u2019s bank account.\n\nCome the final vote, there was almost no one in the Commons. It was all meaningless, whether it passed or failed. None of it would happen anyway. Everything was just a chimera. An election was coming.\n\nSure enough, later that day Johnson gave TV interviews in which he claimed that parliament had both backed his deal and blocked it \u2013 mutual incompatibility is no deterrent to a pathological liar \u2013 and demanded a general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act on 12 December. Any dead cat to distract from the fact he had rather lost enthusiasm for dying in a ditch.\n\nThe Sulk didn\u2019t bother coming to the Commons to make the announcement himself, as he was lost in his alternate realities. So it was left to Rees-Mogg to break the news that had already broken. In reply, Valerie Vaz said Labour would make up its mind about what to do once no deal was off the table and an extension had formally been granted. And when the battle raging inside the party over whether a pre-Christmas election was a suicide mission had been resolved.\n\nMany MPs on both sides of the house looked horrified at the prospect of an election \u2013 the Tories could take a hammering in London, Scotland and the south-west \u2013 but Rees-Mogg just wallowed in the moment. Being in equal parts condescending and patronising to all concerned. Lost in his solipsistic bubble. Nanny would be giving him a ticking off later. Who knows, Rees-Mogg might just turn out to be Labour\u2019s strongest electoral asset.\n\nBut for the moment we were back where we started. No one really knew anything.
