How dare you!\u201d\n\nHer speech was an unusual public display of raw emotion and candour, even for a teenager. It was distinctly Greta, however. Both she and commentators have drawn parallels between her Asperger\u2019s syndrome and the passion she brings to her activism. She says Asperger\u2019s, which she herself has called her \u201csuperpower,\u201d has made her able to focus on a single subject and see the facts clearer, ignoring social cues to be \u201cpolite\u201d and downplay the reality of the situation.\n\nBut the speech was also emblematic of the way her generation is responding to the burning world. Greta\u2019s very Gen Z approach is a product of the mix of intense anxiety and impulse to act \u2014 out of dire need, not idealism \u2014 that has energised other activists of her generation; teens like Emma Gonz\u00e1lez, who made the \u201cwe call BS\u201d speech shortly after her classmates were massacred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, in February 2018.\n\nThese young women\u2019s resistance to the social pressures to calm down about the fact that so much is so wrong with the world \u2014 social pressures which disproportionately affect girls, who are often taught to be well-behaved and polite in public \u2014 is part of what\u2019s made them both so inspiring to many. You can see it in the thousands of young people who heard their calls, marching for gun reform in the wake of the Florida tragedy and then at the Global Climate Strike last Friday, protesting the response to the looming environmental crisis.\n\nIt\u2019s also what\u2019s made them \u201cvoices of their generation,\u201d so to speak. Except in Gen Z\u2019s case, it\u2019s not so much a singular voice that has emerged. Quite consciously, neither Greta nor Emma seek attention for themselves as individuals. What animates them is an overwhelming sense of having been abandoned by the adults and needing to take matters into their own hands. Whether it\u2019s gun reform or climate change, Gen Z is calling the offenders exactly what they are and not mincing words: greedy, corporate-backed officials who are trading the world for their own benefit.\n\nThese realities, according to psychologists, have also made Gen Z overwhelmingly stressed and anxious. \u201cIn the past year, 91% of Gen Z experienced one or more emotional or physiological stress-related symptoms,\u201d B. Janet Hibbs, PhD, a psychology professor and co-author of The Stressed Years of Their Lives, tells Refinery29, citing an October 2018 report from the American Psychological Association. \u201cTop among their list of concerns is climate change. This generational distress, exemplified in Greta Thunberg\u2019s passionate appeal to world leaders at this week\u2019s U.N. session, is hostage to the reality that they are inheriting the brave and frightening new world that the older generations seem numb to.\u201d\n\nNot only are symptoms of anxiety and depression up among Gen Z, but they\u2019re more likely to be distrustful of the government and corporations, according to 2016 research by Noreena Hertz for The Guardian. They believe the system is rigged against the marginalised.\n\nAt the same time, 92% of this generation believes that helping others in need is important, and 70% say inequality worries them greatly. So they may be anxious and distrustful \u2014 but they\u2019re young enough to pick up and actually do something about it. Another study, by Sparks & Honey, a cultural consultancy, found that 60% of Gen Z wants to change the world, compared to 39% of millennials. Commentators note that it\u2019s more of a pragmatism than an idealism that inspires Gen Z to do so.\n\n\u201cThe most common name this group is given is Gen Z; I call them Generation K, after Katniss Everdeen, the determined heroine of the Hunger Games,\u201d Hertz wrote in The Guardian. \u201cLike Katniss, they feel the world they inhabit is one of perpetual struggle \u2014 dystopian, unequal, and harsh.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "When 16-year-old Greta Thunberg addressed the 2019 U.N. climate action summit on Monday, the way she excoriated world leaders for their inaction on climate change was striking.
