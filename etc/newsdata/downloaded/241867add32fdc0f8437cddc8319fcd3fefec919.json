It forecasts a slight decline in sales and a drop of up to 30% in EBIT before special items.\n\nThe company is in the midst of an overhaul aimed at boosting profitability, which includes reducing its workforce. As of the end of September, around 1,800 positions had been reduced globally, it said.\n\nWrite to Kim Richters at kim.richters@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 01:44 ET (05:44 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
