We need to fix this country.\"\n\nMSNBC's Ali Velshi asked the audience, which consisted mainly of students, to raise their hands if they liked the idea. \"A few, alright.\"\n\nWilliamson smirked at the crowd's reaction.\n\n\"To save the country. It's not just the climate,\" she said.\n\nThe climate forum was hosted by MSNBC and Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, giving college students the opportunity to ask candidates questions. This is not the first time Williamson has mentioned of national service for young people. Her campaign website includes an outline of a program that would \"be a way that every American citizen spends one year of their youth in service to the repair of our nation.\"\n\nShe lists service projects including helping in small businesses, schools, hospitals, the military, the Peace Corps and work on sustainability and to \"combat the climate crisis.\"\n\nThe paid service she details on her website, however, appears to be voluntary: Williamson's administration would start a program where young adults \"can perform one year of National Service.\"\n\nShe said at the climate forum that Americans need to come together in a \"World War II mass mobilization.\"\n\nShe later added, \"During World War II, it wasn't Democrats vs. Republicans, left vs. right. We are all Americans. And we are going to mobilize.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Marianne Williamson proposes mandatory national service at climate forum", "description": "At a presidential climate forum hosted by MSNBC, Marianne Williamson said Americans need a \"World War II\" level of mobilization against climate change.", "authors": ["Jeanine Santucci", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VYVYZHKZMRFfFnJqvHdWwQ--~B/aD02ODY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/f9adf3d4f688cc5dbb0f4645882aa596", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
