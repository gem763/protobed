MLC in September hired Darren Stevens \u2013 a former Mercer and Bravura executive \u2013 as group executive, platforms, indicating it may also be ramping up its focus on platform distribution ahead of the slated exit of MLC from NAB.\n\nAMP chief executive Francesco De Ferrari has also listed platform innovation and financial adviser-facing technology as an ongoing focus of his transformation strategy for the troubled wealth manager.\n\n\u201cInstitutions are re-pricing and re-developing and announcing changes in strategy,\u201d said Mr Alcock. \u201cWe helped lead that innovation and competition, so we welcome it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts list this increasing \u201ccompetition from incumbent providers\u201d as a downside risk, alongside increasing regulatory scrutiny, but maintain a \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation on Hub24 following the September quarterly results.\n\n\u201cOverall we see this as a strong start to the year for Hub and validation of the overall trends towards the speciality platform providers driven by leading investments in functionality and independence from vertical integration,\u201d said analysts Aaron Yeoh and Grace Fulton.\n\nPole position in managed accounts\n\nWhile Netwealth tops the charts on a number of key metrics, and the big bank platforms retain market share, Mr Alcock points to Hub24\u2019s dominance in the managed accounts market segment.\n\nOf the $14.4 billion in FUA held by Hub24, 44 per cent is comprised of holdings in managed accounts or portfolios.\n\nHub24 leads Netwealth in Investment Trends rankings for the managed accounts market, based on both financial adviser sentiment and the research house\u2019s own benchmarks.\n\nInvestment Trends wealth management research director Recep III Peker agreed that Hub24\u2019s prime position in the managed accounts segment is significant, given it is the \"fastest-growing segment\" among financial adviser technology and product recommendation options.\n\nBut he said Netwealth is unlikely to be fazed by its second position in the managed accounts market, given its top spot in broader platform rankings.\n\n\u201cIt is not a problem for Netwealth,\u201d Mr Peker said. \u201cHub24 is relatively newer and built its proposition around managed accounts. Netwealth commenced with a focus on direct equities and entered the managed accounts space later.\u201d", "description": "Hub24 has reported quarterly net inflows of $1.23 billion, as it seeks to maintain a lead over bank-owned wealth management platforms.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9464%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_644%2C$y_33/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fa8719d101fe153d3f7d7282b73d6890b9cd1383", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
