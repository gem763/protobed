He stressed that \"the Chinese side came with great sincerity.\"\n\nAdding to that, the official China Daily newspaper said in an editorial in English on Friday: \"A partial deal is a more feasible objective\".\n\n\"Not only would it be of tangible benefit by breaking the impasse, but it would also create badly needed breathing space for both sides to reflect on the bigger picture,\" the paper said.\n\nMr Trump, who said on Thursday that talks with the Chinese had not gone well, has previously insisted he would not be satisfied with a partial deal to resolve his two-year effort to change China's trade, intellectual property and industrial policy practices, which he argues cost millions of US jobs.\n\nInvestors and business groups, however, saw China's dangling of a partial deal as a sign of progress.\n\nChina's securities regulator on Friday also unveiled a firm timetable for scrapping foreign ownership limits in futures, securities and mutual fund companies for the first time. Increasing foreign access to the sector is among the US demands at the trade talks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeijing previously said it would further open up its financial sector on its own terms and at its own pace.\n\nChinese officials also are offering to increase annual purchases of US agricultural products, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing unidentified sources.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Thursday confirmed net sales of 142,172 tonnes of US pork to China in the week ended October 3, the largest weekly sale to the world's top pork market on record.\n\nA US-China currency agreement is also being floated as a symbol of progress in talks between the world's two largest economies, although that would largely repeat past pledges by China, currency experts say, and will not change the dollar-yuan relationship that has been a thorn in Trump's side.\n\nPessimism still 'justified'\n\nAnalysts have noted China sent a larger-than-normal delegation of senior Chinese officials to Washington, with its commerce minister, Zhong Shan, and deputy ministers for agriculture and technology also present.\n\nThe sudden optimism about a potential de-escalation is in stark contrast to much more gloomy predictions in business circles just days ago on the heels of a series of threatened crackdowns on China by the Trump administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, the US government widened its trade blacklist to include Chinese public security bureaus and some of China's top artificial intelligence startups, punishing Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities.\n\nSurprised by the move, Chinese government officials told Reuters on the eve of talks that they had lowered expectations for significant progress.\n\nFriday's China Daily editorial also warned that \"pessimism is still justified\", noting that the talks would finish just three days before Washington is due to implement higher tariffs.\n\nThe negotiations were the \"only window\" to end deteriorating relations, it added.\n\nThere have also been reports that the Trump administration is readying additional measures aimed at China, with unknown consequences for trade negotiations.\n\nSuch wildly shifting expectations have been a persistent feature of the trade war, and observers remained cautious over what might emerge from this week's talks.\n\n\"China wants peace, but I don't think China will give more,\" one Chinese trade expert said on condition of anonymity.\n\nReuters", "description": "The US president sounded an optimistic note as trade talks entered a second day with China aiming to cool the heated dispute between the two countries.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4175%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_279%2C$y_14/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7b48319d1f3b4e1f7567b0a6b6057c3d6c21bf2b", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
