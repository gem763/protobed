The El Paso shooting took place a few days after a Walmart employee in Southaven, Miss., shot and killed two coworkers.\n\n\u201cOur immediate priorities were supporting our associates and the impacted families and cooperating with law enforcement. In parallel, we have been focused on store safety and security,\u201d McMillon said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also been listening to a lot of people inside and outside our company as we think about the role we can play in helping to make the country safer. It\u2019s clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nMcMillon announced an end to the sale of short-barrel rifle ammunition such as the .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber after selling through their current supply. Similarly, Walmart will discontinue handgun ammunition after selling through their current supply, and will discontinue sales of handguns in Alaska, the last state where those weapons are sold, effectively ending all handgun sales nationwide.\n\nMcMillon also noted that it is \u201crespectfully requesting\u201d that customers no longer openly carry guns into their stores in response to several incidents of men bringing a firearm into Walmart stores, including in El Paso. Just days after the El Paso shooting, a man also caused \u201cpanic\u201d at a Missouri Walmart when he walked in heavily armed and wearing body armor. The company said its concealed carry policy will not change.\n\n\u201cAs it relates to safety in our stores, there have been multiple incidents since El Paso where individuals attempting to make a statement and test our response have entered our stores carrying weapons in a way that frightened or concerned our associates and customers,\u201d McMillon said. \u201cWe believe the opportunity for someone to misinterpret a situation, even in open carry states, could lead to tragic results.\u201d\n\nMarch For Our Lives, as well as individual survivors and parents of victims of the shooting in Parkland, Florida, thanked Walmart on Twitter after the news went public. Those who spoke out include March For Our Lives cofounder David Hogg and Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime Guttenberg died during the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018.\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates have also praised Walmart, including Bernie Sanders, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Juli\u00e1n Castro.\n\nWrite to Jasmine Aguilera at jasmine.aguilera@time.com.", "description": "Walmart is changing gun policies including discontinuation of sales for certain firearms, and ending open carry inside of Walmart stores.", "authors": ["Jasmine Aguilera"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/walmart-guns-el-paso.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1"}
