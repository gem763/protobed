It could obstruct the work of service providers in these fields as it already has in the areas of homelessness and foster care.\n\nMoreover, such language could drive a wedge between parents and their children.\n\nDangers of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Language\n\nRecent debates in the House over the Equality Act highlighted some of the perils of adding the language of gender identity and sexual orientation into federal law.\n\nBecause of state laws that enshrine this language, medical providers are being sued because they do not support transgender activists\u2019 recommended medical treatments for gender dysphoria. These include the experimental use of hormones on children as young as 8 and double mastectomies on girls as young as 13.\n\nThere is vigorous debate in the medical community about the best treatments for gender dysphoria.\n\nSome distinguished professionals do not think transition surgery is good medicine. Yet in 15 states, transgender activists have already succeeded in banning counseling that would allow parents and children to undergo a period of \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d to see if children become comfortable with their bodies. This is unwise.\n\nIndividuals who suffer from anorexia, bulimia, body integrity identity disorder (the desire for loss of a limb or a sense), or gender dysphoria experience deep discomfort with their bodies, which can lead to mistaken beliefs about themselves and reality.\n\nBut, as Ryan T. Anderson has explained:\n\nThe most helpful therapies focus not on achieving the impossible\u2014changing bodies to conform to thoughts and feelings\u2014but on helping people accept and even embrace the truth about their bodies and reality. A sound understanding of physical and mental health [and] medicine [aims] at restoring health, not simply satisfying the desires of patients.\n\nStudies show that 80% to 95% of gender-dysphoric children eventually grow out of their dysphoria and become comfortable with their bodies after puberty if there is no hormonal or surgical intervention.\n\nMoreover, those who undergo sex-reassignment surgery commit suicide at 19 times the rate of the general population, and almost double the rate of transgender-identifying adults overall.\n\nThis high rate is not simply owing to a failure of society to accept transgenderism. Adults like Walt Heyer who suffered from gender dysphoria, and now regret having pursued sex-reassignment, say counseling saved them from suicide.\n\nJames Shupe, who attributes his gender dysphoria to PTSD and other traumas, said the transgender community\u2019s medical recommendations endangered his life.\n\n\u201cIt did not help me at all,\u201d Shupe said. \u201cIt destabilized my mental health, because I was living in a false reality. I was fighting my body. I was fighting society. I perfectly understand why this kills people and why there\u2019s such a high suicide rate. Society gets the blame. It\u2019s not society. It\u2019s the program itself that\u2019s killing us.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cprogram\u201d recently led a government agency in Cincinnati to charge parents of a gender-dysphoric girl with child abuse when they expressed a preference for counseling and would not consent to testosterone treatments for their daughter.\n\nAfter the agency\u2019s charge against the parents, a state judge terminated the couple\u2019s parental rights.\n\nSimilarly, in Illinois, the state has mandated that its child welfare employees and prospective foster parents follow the recommendations of the transgender movement or else be disqualified from serving.\n\nA prospective foster parent who wants to allow a gender-dysphoric child a period of \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d will be weeded out of the prospective pool of families.\n\nThis move is especially misguided at a time when there are 17,920 children on the waiting list for foster families in Illinois (and more than 437,500 children nationwide).\n\nPutting Transgender Ideology Into Law\n\nThe House version of the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, or H.R. 2480, which passed in May, would expand abuse-prevention outreach requirements to include \u201csexual and gender minority youth.\u201d\n\nThe bill itself does not define the term, but references the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s definition of \u201csexual minority youth\u201d that also includes the term \u201ctransgender.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s use of the terminology of transgender theory adopts one side of the debate over the best medical treatments for gender dysphoria.\n\nIn addition to incorporating the terminology of the transgender movement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cites one of the most powerful transgender lobbying organizations, the National Center for Transgender Equality, as a resource. It openly promotes sex-reassignment procedures and supports litigation against those who hold a different view.\n\nThe National Center for Transgender Equality website states:\n\nIt is illegal discrimination for your health insurance plan to refuse to cover medically necessary transition-related care. \u2026 For example, if a plan covers breast reconstruction for cancer treatment, or hormones to treat post-menopause symptoms, it cannot exclude these procedures to treat gender dysphoria.\n\nThis isn\u2019t dangerous for the activists, but rather, for people who suffer from gender dysphoria, including youth.\n\nAnd new language in the legislation requires state governors who receive federal funds for child abuse prevention to ensure the state will integrate efforts with organizations that partner with \u201csexual and gender minority youth.\u201d\n\nMedical associations, medical professionals, de-transitioners, biological parents, and prospective parents all stand to be harmed if federal law adopts the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention terminology and accepts the transgender community\u2019s recommended medical treatments for gender dysphoria.\n\nIf the bill passes the Senate with the same language as the House version, the federal government\u2019s treatment of vulnerable children and youth will be increasingly under the control of the transgender movement\u2019s political ideology.\n\nBut, as Princeton University professor Robert P. George states, \u201cChanging sexes is a metaphysical impossibility because it is a biological impossibility.\u201d\n\nChanges to law that require service providers to affirm sex-reassignment as the only valid treatment for gender dysphoria could ultimately reduce the pool of available providers and lead to greater harms to gender-dysphoric children and their parents.\n\nResearch Being Ignored\n\nTo strengthen efforts to address child abuse, lawmakers should consider the well-documented and widely-agreed upon evidence on family structure.\n\nThe House version of the child abuse legislation draws on the most recent National Incidence Study of Child Abuse to make recommendations, including preference under the Adoption Opportunities program for \u201csexual and gender minority youth.\u201d\n\nBut the legislation does not address the population that is statistically most at risk\u2014children in unstable families.\n\nIndeed, the bill seems to ignore the study\u2019s findings on family structure, including that children living with a single parent and their unmarried partner were sexually abused at a rate nearly 20 times higher than children living with their married biological parents.\n\nWhen lawmakers create conditions for service providers to partner with the government, they should rely on the highest quality and most reliable research, not on controversial political ideology.\n\nHopefully the Senate will give weight to the evidence that the research provides about family structure and incorporate this information into its public-private partnerships.\n\nDoing so would go a long way toward empowering service providers, rather than crowding them out if they don\u2019t assent to controversial new gender ideology.\n\nLegislation Could Backfire on the Elderly\n\nThe other community at risk is the elderly.\n\nAs Congress considers modernizing the Older Americans Act, Sens. Michael Bennet, D-Colo.; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; and Bob Casey, D-Pa.; have introduced the Inclusive Aging Act.\n\nThis proposal would establish an Office of Inclusivity and Sexual Health within the Administration on Aging, as well as a new grant program to be carried out under that office.\n\nThe new grant program would follow the troubling trend of making transgender theory into a political litmus test that excludes some service providers, including faith-based ones, from participating in government-run programs, obtaining licensing, or serving communities in need.\n\nOrganizations that follow a biology-based definition of sex rather than transgender theory may not be able to satisfy new requirements in the Older Americans Act unless they offer the full array of \u201csexual health services,\u201d or that they have a \u201cformal relationship\u201d with organizations that assist LGBT individuals.\n\nThe legislation would establish an Office of Inclusivity, and only elder care providers who can prove they embrace LGBT ideology will be eligible for grant money.\n\nIn California and Murkowski\u2019s home state of Alaska, both faith-based and secular women\u2019s homeless shelters are embroiled in litigation over whether transgender theory will override the sex-segregation of private facilities such as sleeping facilities and showers.\n\nSimilarly, the introduction of transgender theory into the elder care arena could complicate the work of facilities such as nursing homes that have sex-segregated private facilities.\n\nLetting Faith Groups Continue to Serve\n\nThese are the clear harms that could result if the government conditions efforts to care for the vulnerable on assent to controversial new political views about sexuality and sex differences.\n\nMany in this nation are moved to care for the least among us because of their faith. Each year in America, an estimated 350,000 religious congregations operate schools, pregnancy resource centers, soup kitchens, drug addiction programs, homeless shelters, and adoption agencies that serve 70 million Americans.\n\nThe value of their services is estimated at $44.3 billion annually. Religious organizations account for 40% of the top 50 U.S. charities.\n\nBut if these organizations and others must accept beliefs about sexuality and sex differences that are opposed to scientific and medical knowledge and to their religious beliefs, they may not be able to continue serving. And without their contributions, the federal government may not have enough resources to serve the needy.\n\nLawmakers should consider these problems before politicizing the care of the elderly and children.", "description": "Congress is right when it considers policies that serve the most vulnerable Americans, particularly children and the elderly, who are most susceptible to abuse.\n\nBut such policies come under threat when controversial gender ideology is injected into the language of otherwise good legislation.\n\nThat\u2019s what is happening with two bills under consideration: the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act and the Older Americans Act.", "authors": ["Emilie Kao", "Commentary By", "Director Of The Richard", "Helen Devos Center", "Summer Member Of The Young Leaders Program At The Heritage Foundation"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-07/GettyImages-1052957428.jpg?itok=3lK_ZS-g"}
