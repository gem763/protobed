Goldschmidt fell over changing direction and couldn\u2019t corral the ball with his bare right hand.\n\nFlaherty retired the next three batters after the hit and has struck out 11. His only previous hint of trouble came in the fourth inning, when he gave up back-to-back walks to Domingo Leyba and Eduardo Escobar before striking out the next two batters.\n\nThe 23-year-old Flaherty is continuing his run of excellent September pitching. He had a 2-1 record with a 1.20 ERA in his previous four starts, including giving up just one run over eight innings in his last outing against the Chicago Cubs.\n\nFlaherty carried a no-hitter into the sixth against San Francisco on Sept. 3 and finished with eight innings of one-hit ball.\n\nThe Diamondbacks were eliminated from the NL wild-card race after last night\u2019s 9-7 loss to the Cardinals. NL Central-leading St. Louis is on a six-game winning streak.\n\nThe Cardinals lead 1-0.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "St. Louis Cardinals right-hander Jack Flaherty lost his no-hit bid in the seventh inning when Eduardo Escobar's hard grounder took a bad hop and couldn't be fielded cleanly by first baseman Paul Goldschmidt.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Brandt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/cardinals_diamondbacks_baseball_32271_c0-127-3045-1902_s1770x1032.jpg?a8b7d87645ac6a8dcec7fde498d3a711b61e729d", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
