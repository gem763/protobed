Relax and enjoy the company of those around you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you value in your life?,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn the end, that's what matters.\u201d\n\nKuzma passed away on Sept. 22 after a recurrence of laryngeal cancer.\n\nShe was a gifted support teacher at a high school in Erie County, according to her obituary.\n\n\u201cIn my spare time, I enjoyed reading, cuddling with my cats, wine tasting, relaxing on my dad's boat, watching movies, golfing, decorating my house, watching football (go Steelers!), appreciating a good sunset, and watching TV shows like Grey's Anatomy, the original Will and Grace, and Friends,\u201d she wrote about her hobbies outside of work.\n\nChristopher Millette/Erie Times-News via AP\n\nKuzma found some humor in her battle against cancer, writing, \"When you have recurrent laryngeal cancer that just won't take no for an answer, you have a lot of time to think about death. The good thing is I no longer have to worry about saving for retirement, paying off student loans, or trying not to get skin cancer???\"\n\nTurning more serious, she added, \"One positive outcome from having recurrent cancer was that it taught me to let go of the insignificant things and to just enjoy the people and places.\"\n\nWhen Kuzma found out her cancer had returned, she wrote that she traveled to Mexico and saw Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, an ancient Maya city.\n\n\"I am extremely grateful for the life that I lived,\" she wrote. \"I was fortunate to have a loving family, supportive friends, a stable and meaningful job, and a house to call my own.\"\n\nKuzma is survived by her parents, a sister, a family dog and two cats, in addition to other family and friends.\n\nThe obituary includes a note that it was \"written by Ashley preceding her passing as part of the many preparations to make the transition easier on her family.\"\n\nBesides knowing how to live life, Kuzma also knew how she wanted to be remembered.\n\nShe asked that her family host a celebration of life \"since I think viewings are too sad for everyone.\"\n\nShe also asked that in lieu of flowers, her friends and family send donations to two animal-focused charities and Hope Lodge, a home for cancer patients and their caregivers in Cleveland, Ohio.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/ashley-kuzma-ap-jt-191007_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
