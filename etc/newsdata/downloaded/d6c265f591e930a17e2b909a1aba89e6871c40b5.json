In fact, investors pulled so much money out of MTUM \u2014 $1.2 billion \u2014 in the past month alone that it\u2019s now down $235 million in the year to date.\n\nAs a reminder, the momentum trade in the stock market is one that does well in the waning stages of an expansion, when investors aren\u2019t as keen on finding lower-priced value stocks that may turn out profitable later on. \u201cMomentum\u201d implies buying more of the same that others have already bid up.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s reflation that\u2019s turning the \u2018Great Rotation,\u2019 these analysts say\n\nAt the end of the summer, it looked briefly like the momentum trade was being replaced by a rotation to value stocks, as central bank stimulus seemed to buy more time for investors. But now there\u2019s an extra note of caution in the way exchange-traded fund investors are positioning themselves, noted Ned Davis\u2019 Will Geisdorf.\n\nThe iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA fund USMV, +0.04% is the ETF that\u2019s experienced the most inflows so far this year: $12.4 billion total, with $2.3 billion of that in the last month alone.\n\nMarketWatch profiled USMV as part of a comparison of different low-volatility approaches this summer.\n\n\u201cInvestors are nervous, so they are pulling money from some of the more aggressive ETFs and parking it in low vol funds,\u201d Geisdorf told MarketWatch. What\u2019s more, \u201cUSMV has done a great job outperforming the market during declines.\u201d\n\nRelated: Tired of market turbulence?
