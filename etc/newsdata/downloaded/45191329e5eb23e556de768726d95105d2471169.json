Flavored products have attracted particular scrutiny from policymakers who say they are getting children hooked on nicotine.\n\nBut Massachusetts would go beyond a flavor ban to also temporarily eliminate tobacco and marijuana e-cigarettes from the market. Officials say the halt will allow time to properly investigate a crisis that\u2019s expanded to 530 cases in 38 states as of last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this public health emergency is to temporarily pause all sales of vaping products so that we can work with our medical experts to identify what is making people sick and how to better regulate these products to protect the health of our residents,\u201d Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) said in a statement.\n\nSan Francisco became the first major U.S. city to effectively ban all e-cigarette sales this summer by targeting products that have yet to gain FDA approval. But San Francisco\u2019s policy will not go into effect until early next year, while Massachusetts\u2019s new rules take effect immediately \u2014 and on a much larger scale.\n\nHow a wave of mysterious illnesses sparked an e-cig crackdown. Here\u2019s what you need to know\n\nThe state\u2019s new policy drew swift criticism from e-cigarette advocates and companies that have long argued their products help rather than hurt public health by offering smokers an alternative. Some public health officials, too, have promoted vaping as a tool to reduce smoking among adults \u2014 notably in England, where vape shops sit on the grounds of some hospitals.\n\nSixty-one potential cases of vaping-linked illness have been reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health as of Tuesday, the governor\u2019s office said. Official investigations nationwide have connected many of the illnesses to marijuana products bought off the street, but no one item has been linked to all cases. And some patients have reported vaping nicotine, though health professionals note people may be reluctant to admit to using marijuana.\n\nAs The Washington Post has previously reported, the illnesses are largely affecting young people:\n\nAn investigation by state health departments in Illinois and Wisconsin traces the first signs of illness among 53 tracked patients to April. The victims \u2014 mostly young men with a median age of 19 \u2014 overwhelmingly ended up in the hospital, many under intensive care. A third went on respirators. Patients typically experienced coughing, chest pain or shortness of breath before their health deteriorated to the point that they needed to be hospitalized, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other reported symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, fever and weight loss. Many victims have ended up with acute respiratory distress syndrome, a life-threatening condition in which fluid builds up in the lungs and prevents the oxygen people\u2019s bodies need to function from circulating in the bloodstream.\n\nWhile the illnesses have given new urgency to long-brewing concerns over vaping, lawmakers explaining new e-cigarette restrictions in other states have focused on the broader threat of teen addiction.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) announced her state\u2019s flavored e-cigarette ban Sept. 4 as state health officials declared youth vaping a public health emergency, highlighting research on nicotine\u2019s harm to developing brains and on substances in vaping products with unclear long-term health effects. Michigan\u2019s health department also cited evidence that youth who use e-cigarettes are more prone to take up smoking, which most experts believe to be more dangerous than vaping products.\n\nA 2018 government-funded study found that the percentage of U.S. high school seniors who report vaping nicotine within the past month doubled over just a year, sparking a new wave of alarm that e-cigarettes are reversing decades of decreasing youth tobacco use. E-cigarette use among teens has risen faster than any product tracked in the survey\u2019s 40-plus years of existence, researchers say.\n\nPreliminary results from this year\u2019s version of the National Institutes of Health-funded study indicated another jump in student vaping, and researchers expressed particular concern over their finding that about 1 in 9 teens vapes nicotine near-daily.\n\n1 in 9 high school seniors vape nicotine near-daily, new survey says amid e-cigarette scare\n\nMassachusetts is no exception when it comes to vaping\u2019s popularity among young people. More than 40 percent of the state\u2019s youth reported trying e-cigarettes in 2017, and 1 in 5 said they used the products regularly, according to the governor\u2019s office. High school students\u2019 usage rates are six times as high as adults', the office said.\n\nWhile Massachusetts officials focused Tuesday on a need to investigate illnesses, they said that they, too, are concerned about youth vaping.\n\n\u201cVaping products are marketed and sold in nearly 8,000 flavors that make them easier to use and more appealing to youth,\u201d Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s actions include a ban on flavored products, inclusive of mint and menthol, which we know are widely used by young people.\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts governor\u2019s office seemed to anticipate concerns about smoking alternatives Tuesday, saying it will devote more resources to programs that encourage people to quit smoking and increase the capacity of the Massachusetts Smokers\u2019 Helpline.\n\nOpponents still blasted the move as counterproductive.\n\nAustin Finan, a spokesman for leading e-cigarette manufacturer Juul, warned Tuesday that bans on the sale of vaping products will encourage a black market of products with \u201cunknown ingredients under unknown manufacturing standards.\u201d He added that bans will affect adult smokers\u2019 ability to quit and push former smokers back to old habits.\n\nGregory Conley, president of the nonprofit American Vaping Association, called Massachusetts\u2019s halt on sales of nicotine vaping products \u201cabsolutely absurd,\u201d emphasizing evidence that links the vaping-related illnesses to illegal and contaminated THC cartridges.\n\n\u201cWe agree with the FDA \u2014 if you don\u2019t want to die or end up in the hospital, stop vaping illicit marijuana oils,\u201d he said.\n\nThe tough new regulations also dismayed small-businesses owners facing steep losses. Jonathan Lau, who runs two vape stores in Brighton, Mass., said he and other vape shop owners \u2014 part of the retail industry\u2019s fastest-growing segment over the past decade \u2014 were \u201cblindsided\u201d by the governor\u2019s announcement.\n\nWith vaping products making up close to 90 percent of his shops\u2019 sales, Lau said, he will probably have to close down.\n\nEmployees have been told to show up for work Wednesday, but Lau does not think his stores will open.\n\n\u201cBasically, it\u2019s a death sentence for small businesses in the vape industry,\u201d he said.\n\nPotential culprits in mystery lung illnesses: Black-market vaping products\n\nOfficials around the country have warned people to stop using e-cigarettes altogether while investigators try to get to the bottom of the illnesses and deaths.\n\nAn executive order from California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) last week directed the state\u2019s Department of Public Health to launch a $20 million public awareness campaign about the risks of vaping both nicotine and cannabis substances. California health officials on Tuesday also joined the calls for consumers to stop vaping while the cause of vaping-linked illnesses remains unclear.\n\nOther states are signaling interest in following Michigan, New York and now Massachusetts\u2019s lead in taking a tougher stance on e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more states exploring what emergency powers they have,\u201d said Michael Seilback, assistant vice president for state public policy at the American Lung Association.\n\nSeilback would not express an opinion on Massachusetts\u2019s choice to suspend all vaping sales, telling The Post only that states are being \u201cforced to make hard decisions\u201d and emphasizing his group\u2019s support for the bans on flavored vaping products that other places have adopted.\n\nHe\u2019s eager to see the Trump administration\u2019s proposed ban on flavored vaping sales come to fruition.\n\n\u201cWe think that strong federal action would prevent a piecemeal approach where different jurisdictions are looking at these products differently,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump\u2019s vaping crackdown could help Juul by ending the decade\u2019s biggest small-business success story\n\nHealth Vaping-related illnesses surge as FDA discloses criminal probe\n\nHow two Stanford grads aimed for big tech glory and got Big Tobacco instead", "description": "The state's governor cited the rising toll of mysterious lung illnesses and deaths linked to e-cigarettes.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_eBw6Bsd-XYtkmCBqhmHydbqb2w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UQIMA6G7AEI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
