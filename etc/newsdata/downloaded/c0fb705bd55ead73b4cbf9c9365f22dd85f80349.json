The new clip is going viral online\n\nIt's unclear what the woman is saying to the officer before the video begins but she then moans: 'Ah, yeah. You like that? You like that?'\n\nSpectators are heard guffawing as the handcuffed woman presses her face further up against the glass and utters the inappropriate words while bending her knees to encourage her behind to protrude toward the officer.\n\nAs the woman wearing a red pants sticks out her derriere and rubs it against the cop's groin, he seemingly attempts to ignore her and calls for backup.\n\nBut the woman's apparent attempt to get the officer to release her from his clutches doesn't appear to work and he presses back with his thigh to detain her.\n\nMeanwhile she continues to use the strength of her hips to push away.\n\nBarstool Sports dubbed the incident the 'horniest arrest of all time'.\n\nFootage shows the blonde woman in red pants bend her knees so her bottom sticks out in the direction of the cop\n\nIt's unclear where and when the incident took place or what prompted the arrest. But it appears to occur in a busy nightlife area.\n\nThe identities of those filmed are not known.\n\nMany commenters appeared to find the clip funny but one Instagram user exclaimed: 'This is why I don't want a girl!'\n\nOthers predicted: 'She's gonna be the one that files for sexual harassment.'\n\nA social media user replied: 'Luckily she can't because it was caught on video.'", "description": "A new video posted Sunday of a woman being arrested is going viral as it appears to show her grinding on a police officer as he puts her in handcuffs and moaning: 'Ah, yeah.
