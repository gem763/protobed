A bakery with appetising bread and cakes is depicted up the road with a barber shop and bookmakers nearby.\n\nWindows and doors have been painted onto empty houses, complete with people observing passersby outside. Elsewhere, farmyard animals are drawn coming out of shop doors.\n\n\"Being a tourist village, there was quite a lot of emphasis put on trying to bring about an uplift and see could it be the catalyst for further economic development in the town,\" said Aidan McPeake, director of environmental services for the local council.\n\n\"That seems to be the case now, the village has been very popular this year. It's been very successful.\"\n\nTwo of the shops brightened up with art over the past year are no longer vacant, McPeake said.\n\nThe Northern Ireland government has spent 2 million pounds to tackle dereliction over the past two years and stickers were applied to windows in areas near the luxury golf resort where G8 leaders met to give the impression that business was booming.\n\nBut the \"Brighter Bushmills Project\" was set up by locals last year and supported by the local council, which is among the least well-funded in the North.\n\nThey raised 30,000 pounds, some of which was donated by the local distillery, and the shopfronts depicted are more detailed and colourful than elsewhere. A second phase, developed with the help of government funds, was completed in March of this year.\n\nAs a gateway to the Giant's Causeway, the famous collection of interlocking rock formations considered a World Heritage Centre by the United Nations' cultural agency, Bushmills hopes the initiative will make sure the tourists keep coming.\n\n\"Obviously locals would much rather see the properties filled and in use all the time but this is definitely the next best option,\" McPeake said.", "description": "A man walks past what looks like an old-fashioned grocery, complete with baskets of fruit and vegetables, bottles of liquor and, bizarrely, three geese emerging from its front door.", "authors": ["Cathal Mcnaughton"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ_WjKaT8hGDnIEB7XzCBjn31tGJRZzJ-obx9lPWToxNDPA-da_1JpRKT6Tr7f171YkVopwPv6kFFgynJ140b40EQBKfUC5dY6jjMFJ29G8vH"}
