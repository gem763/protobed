(Virgin Galactic / Blue Origin / Masten via NASA)\n\nNASA\u2019s Flight Opportunities program has selected 25 promising space technologies for testing aboard aircraft, high-altitude balloons and suborbital rocket ships \u2014 including Blue Origin\u2019s New Shepard spacecraft.\n\nBlue Origin, the space venture created by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and headquartered in Kent, Wash., will be involved in testing 11 of the technologies. The company has been providing flights for suborbital space experiments since 2016 at its West Texas spaceport.\n\nThe latest projects were selected as part of NASA\u2019s Tech Flights solicitation. Awardees typically receive a grant or enter into a cost-sharing agreement through which they can select a commercial flight provider that meets the requirements for their payload.\n\n\u201cWith vibrant and growing interest in exploration and commercial space across the country, our goal with these selections is to support innovators from industry and academia who are using rapid and affordable commercial opportunities to test their technologies in space,\u201d Christopher Baker, program executive for Flight Opportunities at NASA Headquarters, said in a news release.\n\n\u201cThese suborbital flights enable researchers to quickly and iteratively test technologies with the opportunity to make adjustments between flights,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to change the pace of technology development and drastically shorten the time it takes to bring an idea from the lab to orbit or to the moon.\u201d\n\nNASA said this year\u2019s awards total nearly $10 million.\n\nThe Flight Opportunities program is funded by NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate and managed at Armstrong Flight Research Center. NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center manages the solicitation and evaluation of technologies to be tested and demonstrated on commercial flight vehicles.\n\nHere\u2019s NASA\u2019s list of selections, organized by topic area:\n\nSupporting sustainable lunar exploration and the expansion of economic activity into cislunar space\n\nCarthage College in Kenosha, Wis:\n\nAdvancements that address the need for accurately measuring propellant levels of spacecraft during dynamic events in zero gravity, such as engine burns.
