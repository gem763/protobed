That\u2019s the opinion of the head of the EU border agency Frontex.\n\nThe comments have sparked a bitter row with charities who say the alternative is to rescue operations is to leave people to their deaths.\n\nFrontex chief Fabrice Leggeri has called for such operations to be re-evaluated in an interview with the conservative daily German newspaper Die Welt.\n\nLeggeri was quoted saying under maritime law everyone at sea had a duty to rescue vessels, \u201cBut we must avoid supporting criminal networks.\u201d\n\nHe said picking up migrants ever closer to the Libyan coast leads traffickers to force more people onto unseaworthy boats with insufficient water and fuel.\n\nHe also said 40% of recent rescue operations at sea off the north African country were carried out by non-government organisations, making it impossible to check the origins of the migrants or their smuggling routes if in some cases the NGOs did not cooperate.\n\nMedecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has labelled the charges \u201cextremely serious and damaging\u201d and said its humanitarian action was not \u201cthe cause but a response\u201d to the crisis.\n\nA spokesperson on refugees working for the Greens within the German parliament said without the NGOs the number of dead would be much higher.", "description": "NGOs react angrily to suggestions that their efforts to rescue migrants off the Libyan coast are encouraging smugglers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/359127/1000x563_359127.jpg", "published_at": "2017-02-27"}
