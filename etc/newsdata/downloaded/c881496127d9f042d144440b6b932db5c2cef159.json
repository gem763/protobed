There is no shame, I\u2019m proud of my players,\u201d he said.\n\nMarseille\u2019s Dimitri Payet made his return after a four-match ban for insulting a referee while Mbappe was handed his first start in two months after struggling with injuries.\n\nThe 20-year-old, who scored a hat-trick after coming on as a second-half substitute against Club Brugge in the Champions League this week, threatened early on but it was Icardi who found the back of the net first.\n\nSteve Mandanda parried the Argentine\u2019s header for Icardi to fire home from point-blank range shortly after Valere Germain had missed a great chance for the visitors.\n\nCAVANI RETURNS\n\nThe French international keeper was beaten by Icardi again in the 27th minute, the striker heading home from Marco Verratti\u2019s through ball.\n\nMbappe made it 3-0 five minutes later, tapping in from Di Maria\u2019s cross.\n\nThe Frenchman was at it again one minute from the break, collecting a defence-splitting pass from Di Maria before curling a 16-metre shot past Mandanda.\n\nPSG took a more casual approach in the second half but came close to adding another, Mbappe missing a sitter from Icardi\u2019s pass and the opportunity to become the first player to score a hat trick in the French \u201cclassic\u201d.\n\nHe was replaced by Edinson Cavani as the Uruguay striker made his comeback after a two-month injury layoff.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nEarlier, Yann Gboho\u2019s last-gap goal earned Stade Rennais a 3-2 home victory over Toulouse which ended the Brittany side\u2019s 10-game winless run in all competitions.\n\nThe result lifted Rennes up to ninth in the standings on 15 points, ahead of 12th-placed St Etienne on goal difference after Les Verts were held to a 2-2 home draw by Stade de Reims - the first time they dropped points in the league since coach Claude Puel took over three weeks ago.\n\nReims are fourth on 18 points.", "description": "Mauro Icardi and Kylian Mbappe scored twice each as Paris St Germain extended their lead at the top of Ligue 1 to eight points with a 4-0 crushing of bitter rivals Olympique de Marseille at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.", "authors": ["Julien Pretot", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445640217&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0UP", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
