REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Alibaba has found a new ally against an old foe. The Chinese internet titan is buying part of video-games group NetEase\u2019s e-commerce business for $2 billion. Perhaps more significantly, the two are forging closer ties in music-streaming, where rival Tencent\u2019s dominance is under antitrust scrutiny.\n\nJack Ma\u2019s $466 billion empire is taking over Kaola, a site known for high-end, foreign goods ranging from Japanese skincare to baby formula from New Zealand. It\u2019s a fast-growing segment in China\u2019s otherwise cooling e-commerce sector. Together, Alibaba and Kaola will have a 50%-plus share of that market, according to data tracker iiMedia.\n\nIt\u2019s an unusual move for Alibaba. The company\u2019s size and heft means it rarely courts local niche competitors. Friday\u2019s deal, though, will see the e-commerce group, along with Ma\u2019s Yunfeng Capital, invest $700 million in NetEase\u2019s music-streaming arm. Known as Cloud Music, the Spotify-like service already boasts over 800 million users and counts search engine operator Baidu, as well as private equity heavyweights General Atlantic and Boyu Capital, as backers. It has still struggled to catch up with market-leader Tencent, which also competes head on with NetEase\u2019s core video-games business.\n\nThe timing is helpful. The country\u2019s antitrust watchdog is investigating Tencent Music Entertainment over exclusive licensing deals it struck with major record labels, media reported just last month. It\u2019s a controversial practice that has given the company\u2019s dominant music apps a powerful advantage over rivals. A potential crackdown on these agreements, combined with Alibaba\u2019s backing, could help level the playing field for NetEase, whose own market capitalisation is less than a tenth that of its nemesis.\n\nThat suggests further deals could follow. Alibaba operates its own music-streaming service, which could eventually be folded into Cloud Music. And NetEase\u2019s remaining e-commerce operations, a private-label brand, looks ripe for divestment too. This budding alliance, combined with a regulatory assault, spells more trouble for Tencent.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Alibaba has found a new ally against an old foe.
