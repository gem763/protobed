She launched the company with $250,000 which she'd saved from endorsements, fashion partnerships, appearances and reality TV gigs having grown-on camera. While the bulk of her money comes from the beauty company, she owned a string of homes beforehand. She also makes a rumored $1million per paid Instagram post. This is how she likes to spend the cash. Homes Jenner bought her first home aged 17. It was a $2million property in Calabasas, where she grew up, which she sold for $3.15million. She made $500,000 from the flip. In 2016, she bought a $6million in Hidden Hills. She sold that house in 2017 and made $1million from the deal. Three months later, she bought another property in the same area. She sold it for nearly $800,000 more than she paid for it. Earlier this year, she and Scott bought a Beverly Hills mansion together for $13.45million. She also owns another $12million home in Hidden Hills. Cars One of the young star's passions are cars. She owns multiple including Ferraris, a Lamborghini Aventador, multiple Mercedes and a few Rolls Royces. Scott bought her a Ferrari LaFerrari as a 'push present' after she gave birth to their daughter Stormi. Clothes Jenner's astonishing collection of Hermes handbags is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Like her sisters and mother, she owns multiple Birkin bags which, in their most basic form, cost upwards of $10,000. Vacations The 22-year-old mogul is frequently vacationing with friends and likely footing the bill for it. Yacht trips in the Caribbean are common and she recently returned from a long European vacation to celebrate her birthday.\n\nShe posted the video with an orange heart, Jack-o\u2019-lantern and ghost emojis.\n\nKylie is the wealthiest of her famous siblings thanks to her make-up company, Kylie Cosmetics.\n\nEarlier this year, she was named as the world's youngest self-made billionaire because of it.\n\nThe company is worth an estimated $900million.\n\nIt launched in November 2015, selling only online, and the website crashed because demand was so high.\n\nThe post came just days after reports of Kylie's split with rapper Travis Scott and then was spotted at ex Tyga's recording studio at 2am.\n\nKylie then took to Twitter on Thursday morning after her late night visit emerged in exclusive pictures obtained by DailyMail.com and maintained that the trip was innocent.\n\nTaking to Instagram she told fans: 'The internet makes everything 100 times more dramatic than what it really is. There was no \"2am date with Tyga\".\n\n'You see me drop two of my friends off at a studio that he happened to be at.'\n\nThe seeming connection between the two raised eyebrows, coming just the day news broke that Kylie and her baby daddy Travis had secretly broken up weeks ago.\n\nBut Kylie wrote on Thursday: 'Travis and I are on great terms and our main focus right now is Stormi\u203c\ufe0f our friendship and our daughter is priority.'\n\nTyga has not commented on his links with Kylie. Instead he posted an emoji image of a cap, just half an hour after Kylie's damage control tweets.\n\nThe simple image had no caption. However his message was taken by some to refer to 'cappin it' - a slang term for someone who is lying and attempting to put a cap on it.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kylie partied with pals Anastasia 'Stassi' Karanikolaou and Kelsey Calemine at West Hollywood hot spot Delilah from around midnight until shortly after 2am.\n\nKylie looked downcast as she got into her blue Rolls Royce with her pals while leaving the hotspot.\n\nIn an eyebrow-raising twist, they headed straight to the studio where Tyga was at work. Curiously, rather than dropping her pals off at the main entrance, the Rolls Royce was pictured parked up for some time inside the hotel's lot.\n\nDespite her later denials, Kylie's spokesperson at first declined to comment when contacted by DailyMail.com on Wednesday.\n\nFeeling herself: Days ago she showed the 28-year-old rapper what he was missing with this sultry social media post as she whore a shimmering orange jumpsuit\n\nReunion: Kylie was also spotted at ex Tyga's (pictured together in September 2016) recording studio at 2am in exclusive pictures obtained by DailyMail.com as she took to Twitter on Thursday to say he trip was innocent\n\nHer entourage - Stassi and Kelsey - were spotted getting out of the blue Rolls Royce and later left the hotel via the same exit as Tyga around 3am. (Stassi and Kelsey headed home in a black SUV.)\n\nKylie managed to stay out of sight during the stop at Sunset Marque, with one onlooker claiming she left via a different exit. However she insists she was simply giving her pals a ride, and did not visit Tyga.\n\nThe lip kit mogul is said to be on friendly terms with her ex and they do occasionally run in the same circles. In fact, she came face to face with him at a strip club called the Sapphire Las Vegas Gentlemen's club in late August, according to TMZ .\n\nThey were at the strip club, which offers private rooms and pole dancing, for Sofia Richie's 21st birthday celebrations.\n\nSad: Kylie and Travis share a 20-month-old daughter named Stormi together as it has been reported that the two are amicably co-parenting, as the family are seen here in August at Travis' documentary premiere in Santa Monica which was their last public outing together\n\nNews of Kylie and Travis' decision to put their relationship broke on Tuesday afternoon. They actually split several weeks ago, after a long period of rows, according to TMZ.\n\nThe reality star began dating the Sicko Mode performer, 28, at Coachella in 2017 and within weeks she was pregnant with their now 20-month-old daughter, Stormi Webster - who they are said to be amicably co-parenting.\n\nThe last time the couple were pictured together was at the August 27 premiere of the Netflix documentary, Travis Scott: Look Mom I Can Fly, which chronicles the rapper's personal and professional life.\n\nThe romance has reportedly been cooling off ever since, yet the insider indicated the relationship wasn't completely over either.\n\nAnother source told E! News: 'Kylie and Travis aren't officially calling it quits on their relationship, but are taking space apart.", "description": "The 22-year-old took to Instagram on Sunday to share videos of her brand new Bugatti Chiron - which retails beginning at\u00a0$3 million - featuring orange interior.", "authors": ["Justin Enriquez For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19402552-0-image-a-23_1570462039665.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
