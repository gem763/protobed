(AP) - The University of Missouri athletic department has apologized and taken down a tweet intended to promote the NCAA\u2019s \u201cdiversity and inclusion week\u201d after receiving complaints that it was racially insensitive.\n\nThe original post, which prompted a quick reaction on social media, showed a graphic with four photos under the words \u201cI am.\u201d At issue is that the white athletes described career aspirations in the graphic, while the black athlete and staff member made statements about race.\n\nArielle Mack, a black freshman track athlete, was pictured with the statement \u201cI am an African American woman.\u201d Chad Jones-Hicks, a black ticket office assistant, according to MU Athletics\u2019 website, was accompanied by the statement \u201cI value equality.\u201d Meanwhile, the caption for Chelsey Christensen, a white gymnast and junior at MU, read, \u201cI am a future doctor.\u201d Another caption attributed to freshman swimmer CJ Kovac, also white, said, \u201cI am a future corporate financer,\u201d with the word financier spelled wrong in the graphic.\n\nIn a separate post, a black male student athlete is pictured with the caption: \u201cI am a brother.\u201d\n\nAfrican American writer Angie Thomas, author of the New York Times\u2019 bestselling books \u201cThe Hate U Give\u201d and \u201cOn the Come Up,\u201d tweeted: \u201cUhhh\u201d in response to the graphic.\n\nThe athletic department said in a statement that the \u201cintent was to provide personal information about our students, but we failed.\u201d The statement said a video it posted better represented the school\u2019s \u201cintent to celebrate our diversity.\u201d\n\nThat video contained an extended quote from Mack, who said, \u201cI am an African American woman, a sister, a daughter, a volunteer and a future physical therapist.\u201d She told the Columbia Missourian that she didn\u2019t think too much of the tweet, as MU Athletics used her own language. She also said the department did the right thing by deleting the tweet in light of the controversy.\n\nFormer Missouri standout quarterback Corby Jones, a Kansas City attorney who is black, told The Kansas City Star\u2019s editorial board that his first reaction was outrage. He said he was left asking, \u201cWhy did we choose those words for those (African American) individuals?\n\nAfter calls to athletic department administrators, Jones came away with a better understanding of the university\u2019s intent. The post was part of a broader NCAA-led inclusion initiative.\n\n\u201cIt was just poorly constructed,\u201d Jones said.\n\nThe controversy comes four years after hundreds of students protested the way university leadership handled complaints from black student groups about racial slurs and other slights on the overwhelmingly white flagship campus. More than 30 black football team members said they wouldn\u2019t play until the university\u2019s president was removed. University system President Tim Wolfe ultimately resigned and Columbia campus Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin stepped down to take another job with the university.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The University of Missouri athletic department has apologized and taken down a tweet intended to promote the NCAA's \"diversity and inclusion week\" after receiving complaints that it was racially insensitive.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
