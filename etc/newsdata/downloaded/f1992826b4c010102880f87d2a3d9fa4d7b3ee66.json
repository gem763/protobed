Becerra allegedly left the scene without stopping, however, which led to police officials issuing a warrant for her arrest. Becerra turned herself in on October 2nd after paying a $100 bond.\n\nCourt records indicate that she arrived at Adventist GlenOaks Hospital in the wake of the crash, where her blood alcohol content (BAC) test revealed she had a .25 BAC, over three times the legal limit of .08\n\nPolice records also indicate that officers visually found her to be impaired at the scene of the traffic crash.\n\nThe police report alleged Becerra was involved in a traffic accident moments after she failed to stop at a stop sign.\n\nShe later left the scene of the crime so police had to find her and, when they did, she was found to intoxicated. The Daily Herald reports that her speech was slurred during the arrest and that she had red, glassy, bloodshot eyes. After a blood test, it was revealed she had been above the legal limit for alcohol consumption.\n\nBecerra's position not revoked\n\nAccording to the Daily Herald, Village trustees have decided not to revoke Becerra\u2019s position until her ongoing court case comes to a conclusion.\n\nVillage President Linda Jackson told the Herald. that they will wait until the case goes to court and thorough investigation is concluded before they decide what to do. \"I don't want to speculate on what we would do,\" Jackson told the Daily Herald.\n\nBecerra\u2019s next court date is scheduled for October 31 in DuPage County court. According to the Center for Disease Control, impaired driving leads to one death across the United States every 50 minutes.\n\nEvery day, according to the Center\u2019s data, 29 people across the United States are killed in motor vehicle crashes that involved an alcohol-impaired driver.\n\nNational problem\n\nAlcohol-impaired driving has become a major focus of law enforcement because it is linked to so many preventable deaths. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that 47 percent of all Illinois vehicle fatalities involve alcohol.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Record Information Services, Inc., Glendale Heights DUI filings have been slightly declining in recent years. While the record count was 167 for DUI filings in 2012, for instance, it dipped to 141 in 2015 and 108 in 2018.", "description": "Village Administrator Raquel Becerra has been charged with two counts of driving under the influence(DUI).", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Jane Flowers", "Asmir Pekmic", "Read More On The Same Topic Luke Mawson", "Singapore Faces Education Challenge Centered On Seniors", "Fitbit Announces Million User Project With Singapore Government", "Dallas Cowboys De Robert Quinn Remains Suspended After Failing Probenecid Test"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/16/os/b_1200x630/village-administrator-raquel-becerra-47-has-been-charged-with-two-counts-of-dui-image-source-qimonopixabay_2340423.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
