(Michael Owens/Zuffa LLC)\n\nWe\u2019ve seen athletes cry. We\u2019ve seen them beg to be believed. We\u2019ve seen them sue and bully and scream to the heavens. We\u2019ve seen them raise their right hand and swear they were clean \u2026 on their god, on their parent\u2019s name, on their children\u2019s life.\n\nWhen it comes to positive tests for performance enhancing drugs, we\u2019ve seen nearly everyone claim they were innocent only to be proven guilty.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhich is why, in the name of Lance Armstrong, no one believes anyone anymore.\n\nExcept, apparently, Nate Diaz.\n\nEveryone believed him.\n\nLast Thursday, Diaz revealed on social media that he had tested positive for elevated levels of a banned substance, in this case something called LGD4033. He said it was some kind of lie and he wouldn\u2019t fight until USADA and the UFC cleared him. He swore all he took were vegan vitamins.\n\nAnd everyone, or nearly everyone, believed him.\n\nJorge Masvidal, his opponent for Saturday\u2019s Madison Square Garden main event at UFC 244, sure did. Masvidal said he\u2019d fight Diaz no matter what the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) was saying.\n\n\u201cI never thought Nate was a cheater,\u201d Masvidal said on Monday.\n\nUFC President Dana White believed him. White said he never for a moment believed Diaz was doping and the reason the UFC hadn\u2019t announced anything was it was trying to get to the bottom of things.\n\n\u201cI one hundred percent knew Nate wasn\u2019t taking anything to cheat,\u201d White wrote on Twitter.\n\nMost fans got behind Diaz. Same with other fighters, media and sponsors. It didn\u2019t seem real. It turned out it wasn\u2019t.\n\nAfter shipping USADA all of his supplements, it was determined Diaz had tested for a slightly elevated amount of LGD4033 due to an organic, plant-based multivitamin he was taking. The devout vegan was vindicated.\n\nStory continues\n\nThen, only after the UFC and USADA announced the results and restored his good name, did Diaz agree the fight with Masvidal, and the millions that comes with it, was back on.\n\n\u201cI think it was a bunch of [expletive],\u201d Diaz said Monday.\n\n(R-L) Nate Diaz celebrates his victory over Anthony Pettis in their welterweight bout during UFC 241 at the Honda Center on Aug. 17, 2019 in Anaheim, California. (Getty Images)\n\nDiaz\u2019s credibility comes from his relentless, if unconventional, commitment to purity and honesty. He\u2019s no choir boy. Far from it. He\u2019s a rough and tumble, anti-establishment brawler from Stockton, California, who, when not beating people up, counts training, triathlons and marijuana as his hobbies.\n\nHe\u2019s real though. Completely and unapologetically real. Everything with him is about honor, and that especially includes the purity of fighting.\n\nWhich is why when he said he was told to keep the test results quiet (he wouldn\u2019t say who told him that) while further testing was done, he refused. If he had, everything would have been cleared up in private and the public would have never known.\n\nHe didn\u2019t care. He wasn\u2019t going to be involved in anything he thought might even look dishonest. And he wasn\u2019t going to allow anyone \u2014 certainly not the UFC \u2014 to have leverage over him.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a part of a big secret,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cPeople on steroids don\u2019t talk about steroids out loud. If we are going to be about the point, let\u2019s get down to the point \u2026 Why is it a secret if it\u2019s not true? You know what I am saying. The keeping-it-a-secret [expletive] is just so people make money. It\u2019s cheating. I\u2019m not going to be a part of that.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s precisely why people believe him. He cares about everything that matters to him \u2014 dignity, fairness, reputation \u2014 and doesn\u2019t care about anything that doesn\u2019t, most notably money. It\u2019s why he stepped away from the Octagon for three years, leaving millions on the table.\n\nAt the time, he didn\u2019t like how he perceived the UFC was treating him after he lost a close majority decision in a rematch against Conor McGregor. They wanted him, he said, to \u201cfight your way back up.\u201d\n\nHe saw the decision as unjust and thus wouldn\u2019t play that game.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m still at the top.\u201d\n\nHe refused to take fights against fighters that didn\u2019t interest him, even though they were lucrative.\n\nJorge Masvidal is seen with Nate Diaz at a news conference for UFC 244, Thursday, Sept. 19, 2019, in New York. (AP Photo/Gregory Payan)\n\nAnd rather than care about any UFC titles, Diaz essentially created his own, the \u201cBaddest Mother[expletive] Belt\u201d and challenged Masvidal, who he does respect, to it. The UFC went along and the \u201cBMF\u201d belt will be handed out Saturday.\n\nA fighter who doesn\u2019t care about a championship belt? That\u2019s Diaz.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants the BMF title,\u201d Diaz reasoned.\n\nHe\u2019s probably right about that.\n\nHe still thinks the entire drug test deal was part of some plot to keep him down. This is unfounded. He offers no proof. It doesn\u2019t even make sense. USADA has been embroiled in controversies, but not of planting positive results to alter fight cards. And the UFC accepts USADA results and stood to lose huge sums having one of its most bankable stars back out of a huge New York show.\n\nDiaz is undeterred by reason.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t have a real mother[expletive] like me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need some leverage over me to keep me from being the king of the thing.\u201d\n\nAlways stating what he truly thinks, even if it makes no sense, just bolsters the trust people have in him. There is nothing to hide with Diaz. Ever. On any and every subject, he\u2019s true to himself.\n\nSo when some PED scandal bubbled up, he just laughed and pulled the curtain back and did what no one \u2014 from hurdlers to home run hitters \u2014 could.\n\nHe got everyone to believe him.\n\nThen got proven right.\n\nThat\u2019s one BMF.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Where there's smoke there's fire, except in the case of Nate Diaz's PED scandal.", "authors": ["Dan Wetzel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/l8kq2dephfJFYYxcM8kVKA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/43pmOk5f.JmAj4qyQE905A--~B/aD0yODA5O3c9NDIxNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/2932e010-f9ce-11e9-9f98-d42da2e16137", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
