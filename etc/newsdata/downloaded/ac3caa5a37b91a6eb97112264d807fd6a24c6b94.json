The redesigned site is organized around the themes Style, Self, Culture, and Power, highlighting the Cut\u2019s best-in-class fashion and beauty coverage, while bringing new prominence to coverage of feminism and politics, wellness and fitness, work and career, parenting, and culture. In the five years since the Cut launched as a stand-alone site, it has continued to expand far beyond its roots as a fashion blog, as president and editor-in-chief Stella Bugbee notes in an editor\u2019s letter introducing the new site: \u201cWe felt it was time for the Cut to reflect how much we\u2019ve grown along with all the conversations around us.\u201d\n\nWith the majority of the Cut\u2019s readers enjoying the site on mobile, the redesign prioritized the smartphone experience, with more white space and an emphasis on discovery for the home page, conceived as a billboard for what the site values and a canvas for our advertising clients.\n\nThe new site categories were arrived at after sorting through hundreds of headlines and finding that Style, Self, Culture, and Power achieved a balance among what the Cut was covering, and provided a framework for getting at what it means to be a woman moving around in the world today. Style is broadly defined, to include fashion, with the Cut\u2019s incomparable critic-at-large Cathy Horyn, beauty, and shopping, as well as home design and an expanded weddings section, all with gorgeous original photography. Self includes mental and physical health, parenting, horoscopes, and advice columns from Heather Havrilesky (Ask Polly) and Lori Gottlieb (What Your Therapist Really Thinks); later this fall sister site Science of Us will begin publishing on this section of the Cut. Culture will encompass celebrities, movies, TV, music, and books, with a Reading Women column launching this week that asks writers like Brit Bennett and Angela Flournoy to talk about their favorite books by women authors. Power will be the home for coverage of politics, feminism, work, money, and issues relating to equality, with writers including Rebecca Traister, Lisa Miller, and Ann Friedman, who this week launches a new column Feminisms Now, a series of in-depth conversations with some of the most thoughtful and provocative women in the world.\n\nThe new Cut will also feature video series such as A Perfect Fit, with the Cut\u2019s market editors offering advice on common fashion dilemmas, launching on Facebook\u2019s new Watch platform. New brand-integration opportunities will be a key feature of the redesign, including revamped branded content to be more in line with the voice of the site, and new high-impact ads for the mobile homepage. Saks Fifth Avenue and Cartier are among the redesign-launch partners.\n\n\u201cAs fashion, beauty, and luxury brands become more sophisticated in their marketing, a women\u2019s site that goes beyond the typical coverage areas is a welcome addition,\u201d says Avi Zimak, New York Media\u2019s CRO and publisher. \u201cThe redesigned Cut provides a sleek, stylish, and user-friendly environment for readers and advertisers, with the smart, funny voice that is the hallmark of all our brands woven throughout.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the redesign on social media, a series of videos will allow Instagram users to watch the new Cut\u2019s mission statement interpreted through the voices of women across different fields. These short conversations discussing \u201cwhat women are made of\u201d will unfold throughout the day Monday, and participants include Rachel Comey, Diane von Furstenberg, Jenn Im, Mari Andrew, the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, and Dawn Lyen-Gardner.\n\nAs Bugbee writes in her editor\u2019s letter, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of this redesign as a twist on the old adage, \u2018Dress for the job you want.\u2019 In our case we are now dressing for the job we have: Showing the world what women are made of.\u201d", "description": "Mobile-first design highlights breadth of coverage areas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/press/2017/08/21/CutHPdesktop.w1200.h630.png"}
