They were dropped by prosecutors in 2009, shortly before Zuma became president, and reinstated in 2016.\n\nHe is alleged to have taken the bribes during his time as a provincial economy minister and later as deputy president of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in the 1990s.\n\nThe charges were raised more than a decade ago but withdrawn, then reinstated after the National Prosecuting Authority announced there were sufficient grounds to bring Zuma (pictured yesterday in the High Court) to trial\n\nZuma was forced to resign from office last year over a separate corruption scandal centred around the Gupta business family, who won lucrative contracts with state companies and were allegedly even able to choose cabinet ministers.\n\nHis successor, President Cyril Ramaphosa, has vowed to crack down on the widespread graft that has eroded support for the ANC, which has ruled the country since the end of the harsh system of white minority rule known as apartheid in 1994.\n\nThe scandals around Zuma also severely hurt investor confidence in South Africa's economy, the most developed in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe US Treasury on Thursday slapped sanctions on the Gupta brothers, calling them a 'significant corruption network' that dispersed bribes and misappropriated millions in state funds.", "description": "Zuma, 77, who is accused of taking bribes from French defence company Thales in the 1990s, sought to have the case permanently dropped in March, saying it was politically motivated.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/00/19585090-0-image-a-48_1570837582797.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
