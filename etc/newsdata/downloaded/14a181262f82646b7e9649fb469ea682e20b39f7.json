According to Kshetri, contemporary voting tokens are anonymous and cannot be used to trace anyone\u2019s identity. He also noted that many of the previous tests involved informal ballots such as community projects and student government groups.\n\nKshetri also voiced concerns that \u201ceven experts don\u2019t have a way to identify every possible irregularity in online voting.\u201d On the other hand, he points out that paper-based voting is well-understood and easy to verify and audit.\n\nOne major issue is identity verification since various secure keys require large amounts of computing power to verify. Because of this, for instance, the initially assigned keys were found to be easy to hack during the last elections in Moscow.\n\nExperts also fear that devices used to vote could be compromised or that facial recognition systems might make mistakes or get tricked by hackers. Lastly, proprietary systems like the one developed by blockchain voting startup Voatz do not allow to verify whether the votes were cast accurately.\n\nTesting on a small scale\n\nThat being said, in November 2018 multiple election officials in the United States allowed members of the military stationed overseas to vote electronically. In the same month, 144 voters living abroad have been approved by West Virginia\u2019s authorities to cast ballots from 31 different countries by means of an app developed by Voatz.\n\nThe state reportedly plans to continue and expand the trial in the 2020 presidential election. Also, 119 voters who were overseas used Voatz\u2019s system to vote during Denver\u2019s municipal primary elections in May.\n\nThe last \u2014 and biggest \u2014 example of blockchain voting test provided by the article is the one used at the beginning of September during the city council elections in Moscow. That being said, out of the city\u2019s 20 electoral precincts, only three allowed users to vote via the Internet because of security concerns.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported on Oct. 18, two state counties in the U.S. are implementing blockchain-based mobile voting in the special elections in November.", "description": "Some major issues must be resolved before blockchain voting becomes trustworthy, according to a new study", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZjMwYjA2ZGZlMzQ0MTFhZmYwNTJjN2IyZjk3OTM0NzcuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
