Thousands have been wounded, including two shot by live rounds.\n\nIn her policy statement, Lam was unapologetic about her government\u2019s response to the protests, which has included introducing British colonial-era emergency laws this month.\n\n\u201cAny acts that advocate Hong Kong\u2019s independence and threaten the country\u2019s sovereignty, security and development interests will not be tolerated,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDespite the stormy times and overwhelming difficulties Hong Kong is experiencing, I believe that so long as we accurately adhere to the principle of \u2018one country, two systems\u2019, we will be able to get out of the impasse.\u201d\n\nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the protesters were trying to humiliate and bring down the Hong Kong government. \u201cThere is no simple solution,\u201d he said.\n\nThe protesters are angry at what they see as Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on Hong Kong, which was guaranteed 50 years of freedoms under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d when Britain returned the city to China in 1997.\n\nBeijing rejects the charge and accuses Western countries, especially the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble. The unrest poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. He has warned that any attempt to divide China would be crushed.\n\nA Norwegian lawmaker, Guri Melby, tweeted that she had nominated the Hong Kong people for the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize for their stand for freedom of speech and democracy.\n\nLam later told a news conference that she had held \u201cclosed door\u201d meetings with some members of the protest movement and when the unrest ended she would hold more.\n\nRESIGNATION CALLS\n\nPro-democracy lawmaker Tanya Chan said Lam should resign.\n\n\u201cBoth her hands are soaked with blood. We hope Carrie Lam withdraws and quits,\u201d an emotional Chan told reporters.\n\nIn her news conference, Lam rejected two of the protesters\u2019 five demands - amnesty for those charged and universal suffrage - saying the first was illegal and the second beyond the chief executive\u2019s power.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam is seen on a screen as she reacts to protests by pro-democracy lawmakers, at the Legislative Council in Hong Kong, China, October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Civil Human Rights Front in a statement also called for Lam to step down.\n\n\u201cWe urge Carrie Lam to stop destroying Hong Kong, respond to the five major demands, and step down,\u201d it said. Lam has for months rejected calls to step down.\n\nThe leader of the group, Jimmy Sham, was attacked hours later by a group of men in the gritty Mong Kok district on the Kowloon peninsula. Photographs on social media showed a bloodied Sham laying in the street. It is the second time he has been attacked since the protests began.\n\n\u201cIt is not hard to link this incident to a spreading political terror in order to threaten and inhibit the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights,\u201d said the group.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s unrest was ignited by an extradition bill, which could have seen residents sent to Communist Party-controlled mainland courts for trial. Lam has said the bill has been withdrawn, but the suspension of the legislature meant it could not be formally dropped.\n\nDensely populated Hong Kong boasts some of the world\u2019s most expensive real estate and the inability of many young people to get a place of their own has fueled the protests.\n\nLam\u2019s housing policy is one of the boldest in recent years, vowing to take back large tracts of land held by a handful of powerful developers and create public housing.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to create home ownership opportunities for people of different income groups such that they will happily make Hong Kong their home,\u201d Lam said.\n\nLam said about 700 hectares of land in the New Territories would be brought back into public use under what is known as a land resumption ordinance. More than half of the land would be taken back in the next few years.\n\nNo Hong Kong leader has take back land from private developers since the handover.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nPro-establishment lawmaker Abraham Shek, who represents the real estate sector, rejected the policy, and the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance party said the policy speech lacked concrete measures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a conservative, procrastinating blueprint with few new ideas,\u201d said the party\u2019s chairwoman, Starry Lee.\n\nMajor developers, including Henderson Land (0012.HK), New World Development (0017.HK) and Sun Hung Kai Properties (0016.HK), are sitting on \u201cno less than 1,000 hectares\u201d of agricultural land, according to government estimates.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam had to abandon her policy speech because of jeering lawmakers on Wednesday but later offered no direct olive branch to pro-democracy protesters, hoping instead to ease resentment by building more public housing.", "authors": ["Clare Jim", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441363631&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0C2", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
