(Project Syndicate) \u2014 In the euphoric moment immediately following the collapse of the Soviet Union, few would have guessed that Ukraine \u2014 an industrialized country with an educated workforce and vast natural resources \u2014 would suffer stagnation for the next 28 years.\n\nNeighboring Poland, which was poorer than Ukraine in 1991, managed almost to triple its per capita gross domestic product (in purchasing power parity) over the next three decades.\n\nWhereas Poland embraced the power of democratic civil society and grew wealthier, Ukraine remained trapped by kleptocratic institutions that bred a culture of corruption and destroyed public trust.\n\nMost Ukrainians know why they fell behind: their country is among the most corrupt in the world. But corruption does not emerge from thin air, so the real question is what causes it.\n\nAs in the other Soviet republics, power in Ukraine was long concentrated in the hands of Communist Party elites, who were often appointed by the Kremlin. But the Ukrainian Communist Party was very much a transplant of the Russian Communist Party itself, and regularly operated at the expense of indigenous Ukrainians.\n\nMoreover, as in most of the other former Soviet republics (with the notable exception of the Baltic countries), Ukraine\u2019s transition away from communism was led by former communist elites who had reinvented themselves as nationalist leaders. This did not work out well anywhere.\n\nBut in Ukraine\u2019s case, the situation has been made worse by a constant struggle for power between rival communist elites and the oligarchs they helped create and propagate.\n\nExtractive institutions\n\nBecause of the dominance of various warring factions, Ukraine has been captured by what our book \u201cWhy Nations Fail\u201d calls extractive institutions: social arrangements there empower a narrow segment of society and deprive the rest of a political voice. By permanently tilting the economic playing field, these arrangements have long discouraged the investment and innovation needed for sustained growth.\n\nCorruption cannot be understood without comprehending this broader institutional context. Even if graft and self-dealing in Ukraine had been controlled, extractive institutions still would have stood in the way of growth.\n\nIs a society-wide mobilization still feasible in a country that has suffered under corrupt leaders and extractive institutions for as long as Ukraine has? The short answer is yes. Ukraine is home to a young, politically engaged population.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened in Cuba, for example, where Fidel Castro took power and put a lid on the previous regime\u2019s corruption, but set up a different type of extractive system. Like a secondary infection, corruption amplifies the inefficiencies created by extractive institutions. And this infection has been particularly virulent in Ukraine, owing to the complete loss of trust in institutions.\n\nModern societies rely on a complex web of institutions to adjudicate disputes, regulate markets, and allocate resources. Without the trust of the public, these institutions cannot serve their proper function.\n\nOnce ordinary citizens start assuming that success depends on connections and bribes, that assumption becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Markets become rigged, justice becomes transactional, and politicians sell themselves to the highest bidder.\n\nIn time, this \u201cculture of corruption\u201d will permeate society. In Ukraine, even universities are compromised: degrees are regularly bought and sold.\n\nA strong state is not the answer\n\nAlthough corruption is more of a symptom than a cause of Ukraine\u2019s problems, the culture of corruption must be uprooted before conditions can improve. One might assume that this simply requires a strong state, with the means to root out corrupt politicians and businessmen.\n\nThe United States is now one of the last countries that should be lecturing Ukraine about corruption.\n\nAlas, it is not that simple.\n\nAs Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s anti-corruption drive illustrates, top-down action often becomes a witch hunt against the government\u2019s political opponents, rather than a crackdown on malfeasance generally. Needless to say, applying a double standard is hardly an effective way of building trust.\n\nInstead, combating corruption effectively requires the robust engagement of civil society. Success depends on improving transparency, ensuring the independence of the judiciary, and empowering ordinary citizens to kick out corrupt politicians.\n\nAfter all, the distinguishing feature of Poland\u2019s post-communist transition wasn\u2019t effective top-down leadership or the introduction of free markets. It was Polish society\u2019s direct engagement in building the country\u2019s post-communist institutions from the ground up.\n\nTo be sure, many of the Western economists who descended on Warsaw after the fall of the Berlin Wall advocated top-down market liberalization.\n\nReaction against \u2018shock therapy\u2019\n\nBut those early rounds of Western \u201cshock therapy\u201d resulted in widespread layoffs and bankruptcies, which provoked a broad-based societal response led by the trade unions. Poles poured into the streets, and strikes skyrocketed in frequency \u2014 from around 215 in 1990 to more than 6,000 in 1992 and more than 7,000 in 1993.\n\nDefying Western experts, the Polish government backpedaled on its top-down policies, and instead focused on building a political consensus around a shared vision of reform. Trade unions were brought to the table, more resources were allocated to the state sector, and a new progressive income tax was introduced.\n\nIt was these responses from the government that instilled trust in the post-communist institutions. And over time, it was those institutions that prevented oligarchs and the former communist elites from hijacking the transition and spreading and normalizing corruption.\n\nBy contrast, Ukraine (as well as Russia) received the full dose of top-down \u201cprivatization\u201d and \u201cmarket reform.\u201d Without even a pretense of empowering civil society, the transition was predictably hijacked by oligarchs and the remnants of the KGB.\n\nIs a society-wide mobilization still feasible in a country that has suffered under corrupt leaders and extractive institutions for as long as Ukraine has? The short answer is yes. Ukraine is home to a young, politically engaged population, as we saw in the Orange Revolution of 2004-2005 and in the Maidan Revolution of 2014.\n\nThe people understand\n\nEqually important, the Ukrainian people understand that corruption must be uprooted in order to build better institutions. Their new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, campaigned on the promise of fighting corruption, and was elected in a landslide. He now must kick-start the cleanup process.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to involve Ukraine in his own corrupt dealings have given Zelensky the perfect opportunity for a symbolic gesture. He should publicly refuse to deal with the Americans until they sort out their own corruption problems (even if it means turning down tainted aid).\n\nAfter all, the United States is now one of the last countries that should be lecturing Ukraine about corruption. To play that role again, its courts and voters will have to make clear that the Trump administration\u2019s malfeasance, attacks on democratic institutions, and violations of the public trust will not stand.\n\nOnly then will the U.S. be a role model worth emulating.", "description": "The Ukrainian people understand that corruption must be uprooted in order to build better institutions.
