Meeting with the occasional minister won\u2019t cut it.\n\n\u201cThe relationship with the opposition is important for many reasons. The most obvious is that our political cycle means that opposition parties will at some stage be in government \u2013 and ruling parties will be in opposition. Another important consideration is that opposition parties can move amendments, stall or stop legislation,\u201d the report concludes.\n\nAndrew Bragg, seen delivering his first speech in the Senate chamber in July, says all MPs want to engage with business and the community. AAP\n\nIt notes that backbench and crossbench MPs influence policy and drive outcomes, and suggests that meeting the relevant shadow minister could be the start of a beneficial and lasting relationship.\n\nLobbyists can handle crisis management when required, but chief executives, chairmen and board members need to manage relationships with key politicians and public servants, guided by government relations consultants.\n\nAndrew Bragg has been on both sides. The one-time Business Council of Australia executive director is an up-and-coming NSW Liberal senator.\n\nHe says scheduling meetings in Canberra during sitting weeks has limited utility.\n\n\u201cIf there are people in business who want to raise a particular issue, you are far better off doing it in people\u2019s natural habitat, which is in their electorates,\u201d he says. \u201cCanberra is a terrible place to have a meeting when you\u2019re trying to discuss a substantial policy issue beyond slogans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn my experience, most business issues are complicated. They usually involve markets. Therefore, trying to have a meeting in between bells and buzzers is nigh on impossible.\u201d\n\nThe Korn Ferry report says learning how government works will save time and resources, and deliver better results. Business leaders need to know how the budget cycle works, and understand that political donations won\u2019t equal policy outcomes.\n\nBragg points to a former Australian Stock Exchange boss as the gold standard.\n\n\u201cNot one person we spoke to thought that donations resulted in influence,\" says Korn Ferry's Katie Lahey. Paul Jeffers\n\n\u201cThe best example I ever saw of an organisation or a person dealing with Canberra was Elmer Funke Kupper,\u201d he says. \u201cHe would go to every single meeting, no matter who it was inside the government. It could be a junior Treasury official, it could be the treasurer; he would meet with an adviser to an opposition shadow minister. I think that is the best approach.\n\n\u201cAs we have seen in the financial sector, it is very important that non-executive directors, chairs [and] chief executives are fully aware of the expectations of policymakers and the law. Clearly there\u2019s a need for more of that, not less.\u201d\n\nAnika Wells calls the Canberra shuffle \u201ca unique species\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf I have prioritised a meeting in a sitting week, it has been a strategic decision based on them sharing priorities with me. Some people will turn up with a brief on how their particular issue or cause impacts in Lilley, with local stats, and you can tell they\u2019ve researched me.\n\n\u201cOther people will turn up and say they\u2019re doing a circuit of all the MPs and hand over a flyer. It\u2019s such a clear tick and flick exercise. That might get you in the door once, but I doubt it will get you in the door again.\u201d\n\nKorn Ferry chairman Katie Lahey says report participants looked back at the Hawke and Howard governments as times when business was brought along effectively in decision-making.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTwo big reforms \u2013 the Prices and Income Accord under Hawke, and the GST under Howard \u2013 were cited as examples of government and business working well together,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe chair or chief executive or organisations that are not engaging productively with government may need to reset their approach.\n\n\u201cThis starts with acknowledging that a good relationship with government is important. The CEO and chair must each value the relationship, and the CEO needs to take responsibility for it.\u201d\n\nLahey has a blunt message on the thorny issue of political donations: \u201cNot one person we spoke to thought that donations resulted in influence. They said donations for policy outcomes is not good government affairs strategy.\n\n\u201cHowever, attending business forums, or other events where you can meet various industry and government people, is worthwhile.\u201d\n\nBragg says all MPs want to engage with business and the community, and says all sides should support the democratic process and do policy development.\n\n\u201cMy greatest fear in this whole area is that policy formulation is only done by unions, think tanks and public servants,\u201d he says. \u201cThat, I think, would be very bad for Australia\u2019s future.\u201d", "description": "Chief executives and company directors meet with MPs every day, yet many don\u2019t know how to do it effectively.
