So it\u2019s possible we could be involved in an accident.\u201d\n\nIngrid Seward, the editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, has been covering the royal family since the \u201880s and has written over 20 books on the subject. Seward claimed on the podcast she was aware of Diana\u2019s concerns over suffering a possible car crash.\n\n\u201cShe said, actually, \u2018It sounds ridiculous now,\u2019 as we were sitting there in the comfort of her sitting room in Kensington Palace, she said, \u2018But I really did believe, genuinely, believe that someone was going to tamper with my car,\u2019\u201d said Seward. \u201cShe said, \u2018I really believed that.\u2019 She said, \u2018I was too much of a problem. They wanted to get rid of me.\u2019\u201d\n\nPaul Burrell, who once served as Diana\u2019s royal butler, alleged that the People\u2019s Princess had members of her staff check her vehicles to ensure her safety.\n\n\u201cShe said to me, \u2018Get underneath and see if you can see anything,\u2019\u201d alleged the 61-year-old. \u201c\u2019Is there a pipe cut where the brake fluid goes in?\u2019 I said, \u2018Your Royal Highness, I\u2019m not an engineer. I don\u2019t know these things.\u2019 \u2018Well, have a look. Is there anything unusual underneath the car?\u2019 So, I\u2019d scramble underneath the car in my uniform, or my suit, and try and find something which looked out of place. Of course, I never did, but she was convinced that the system was out to get her.\u201d\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM SAYS LOSING HIS MOTHER PRINCESS DIANA AT A YOUNG AGE WAS \u2018A PAIN LIKE NO OTHER PAIN\u2019\n\nHowever, Daily Mail royal writer Richard Kay pointed out that as a member of the British royal family and undoubtedly the most famous woman in the world, Diana had plenty of reason to be extra cautious.\n\n\u201cShe was prone to these sort of fears, that something might happen to her,\u201d said Kay. \u201cPeople convinced her that she was somehow some sort of present danger to the royal family and that she should therefore be very careful.\u201d\n\nPatrick Jephson, who served as Princess Diana\u2019s chief of staff and private secretary from 1988 until 1996, claimed to Fox News in August 2018 that Diana became \u201creckless\u201d when it came to her security after her marriage to Prince Charles ended. He alleged Diana cut herself off from her support system from time to time, which was designed to keep her safe.\n\nPARIS WANTS A 'PRINCESS DIANA SQUARE' AT SITE OF HER DEATH\n\n\u201cI never entirely understood,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI think part of it was to make a contrast between herself and the other members of the royal family.\n\n\"Getting rid of the bodyguards, the support organization, I think appealed that side of her\u2026 Instead, she put her trust in people who were not capable of keeping her safe as it was tragically proved to be the case that night in Paris.\u201d\n\nJephson, who didn\u2019t feel he and Diana were seeing eye-to-eye about her future, resigned the year before she died. It was the last time they spoke.\n\n\u201cShe was increasingly taking advice from so-called friends who wanted to exploit her vulnerability,\u201d he claimed. \u201cFor the first time in all my eight years with Diana, I felt that by serving her, I was actually running contrary to the queen\u2019s wishes, which I couldn\u2019t really live with.\n\nPRINCESS DIANA ALMOST STARRED IN \u2018BODYGUARD\u2019 SEQUEL WITH SARAH FERGUSON\u2019S HELP, SAYS KEVIN COSTNER\n\n\"Plus, it had been an extraordinarily intense and stressful eight years\u2026 It was not a happy, final meeting. But that\u2019s how we left it. Of course, had I known what was coming around the corner, I would have probably acted differently.\u201d\n\nDiana\u2019s biographer Andrew Morton previously told Fox News in 2017 that while there have been numerous conspiracy theories surrounding Diana\u2019s sudden death, the explanation for her tragic demise is a simple one.\n\n\u201cWell, I think the paparazzi followed her all of her adult life, so they contributed to her death,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] it wasn\u2019t their fault. It was the fact that she was being driven too fast\u2026 by a man who was found with drugs and [alcohol]. It\u2019s the banality of her death, which I think most people can\u2019t come to terms with.\u201d", "description": "One podcast is alleging Princess Diana of Wales had a grim feeling she was going to suffer a car crash before her 1997 death in Paris.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/08/31/694940094001_5829342180001_5829338460001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
