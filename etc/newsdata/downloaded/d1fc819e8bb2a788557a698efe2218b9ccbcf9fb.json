Hailey Baldwin has left us in the dark, wondering what her wedding dress looked like for and entire week. We've seen her bachelorette party dress, her rehearsal dinner dress, her reception dress, and her day-after-the-wedding outfit. Finally, the new bride has shared her full ceremony look \u2013 and it's just as extra as you imagined.\n\nIn an Instagram blast, Hailey shared two pics of the gown, which she created in collaboration with Off-White designer Virgil Abloh. She walked down the aisle in a long-sleeve off-the-shoulder lace gown with an ultra sexy bustier bodice.\n\nThe train features Virgil's trademark text adapted for the special occasion. The very bottom reads: \"TILL DEATH DO US PART.\"\n\n\"@virgilabloh thank you for making my vision come to life and creating my dream dress,\" Hailey wrote on Instagram. \"You and your @off____white team are incredible and I\u2019m forever grateful I got to wear your beautiful creation. \u2764\ufe0f\"\n\nJustin Bieber didn't end up wearing the banana-covered suit, after all. Instead, he opted for a classic black tux and bow tie.\n\n\n\nName a more stunning duo. I'll wait.\n\nFollow Kelsey on Instagram!\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "The back is STUNNING.", "authors": ["Kelsey Stiegman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/j8ElFIn44I1nojr5HDxUYA--~B/aD0zMTA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/seventeen_632/2b968919685c6ef440135b7432371f0a", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
