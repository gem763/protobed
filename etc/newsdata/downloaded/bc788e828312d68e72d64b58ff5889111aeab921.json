India\u2019s factory gauge slid to its weakest in more than a year. Indonesia\u2019s slipped to its lowest since July 2017 and the Philippines, Thailand, and Myanmar all expanded more slowly. Figures for the euro-area, U.K. and South Africa are similarly bleak.\n\nWhile China\u2019s Caixin Media and IHS Markit PMI stayed in expansion mode, the nation\u2019s official manufacturing PMI dropped to 49.5, according to data released Saturday. Bloomberg Economics Chang Shu noted that gauges on demand and business sentiment in China point at further weakness.\n\n\n\nNot everything can be blamed on the US-China conflict:\n\nSouth Korean exports, a bellwether for world trade, slumped in August for a ninth straight month.\n\nA cooling technology boom and generally weaker global demand is also at play.\n\nIdiosyncratic issues such as a feud between Japan and Korea aren\u2019t helping.\n\nAn October 31 deadline for a possible hard Brexit is souring sentiment in Europe.\n\nAnd there\u2019s still the threat of U.S. tariffs on auto imports, that would hurt Germany in particular.\n\nLooking ahead, the dogfight between the world\u2019s two biggest economies looks to make matters worse.\n\nSince the Trump administration put tariffs on roughly $110 billion in Chinese imports on Sunday, commentaries in Chinese state media shrugged off the move and focused on the pain that U.S. consumers are likely to feel.\n\nThe new levies are \"a turning point in the trade war\" with the US, according to an editorial in the Communist Party\u2019s tabloid Global Times. The report said the tariffs on daily goods are to hit US consumers directly, and it also showed Washington is almost at the end of its wits.\n\n\"he Trump administration has shot Americans in the foot. When more and more Americans feel the pain, maybe it will be time for Washington to recover rationality,\" the editorial said.\n\nCharting the trade war\n\nA 15% tariff that went into effect September 1 on about $112bn of goods imported from China will start pushing up prices of clothing, shoes and other consumer goods arriving at US ports this week.", "description": "The world\u2019s manufacturing powerhouses sent a simple message on Monday: They\u2019re in the doldrums and could be there for a while.", "authors": ["Enda Curran"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8135/63d1ecebae544fee930b4e2703fd8ab7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-02"}
