But an appeals court blocked any handover of the records for now.\n\nAt issue is a request from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. that Trump\u2019s accounting firm turn over eight years\u2019 worth of his business and personal tax returns for an investigation into the payment of hush money to two women who claimed to have had affairs with the president.\n\nU.S. District Judge Victor Marrero turned down Trump\u2019s attempt to keep the tax returns under wraps, saying the president was making a \u201ccategorical and limitless assertion of presidential immunity.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyers immediately appealed to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and it granted a temporary stay of the judge\u2019s ruling \u201cpending expedited review\u201d by the court.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

A thing like this has never happened to any President before. Not even close!\u201d\n\nThe criminal investigation in New York is unfolding with Trump already under siege on Capitol Hill from a fast-moving impeachment drive set off by his attempts to get Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. The judge\u2019s ruling marked the latest in a string of setbacks for the president in the past couple of weeks.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have said that the investigation led by Vance, a Democrat, is politically motivated and that the request for his tax records should be stopped because he is immune from any criminal probe as long as he is president.\n\nMarrero called Trump\u2019s claim of broad immunity \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201can overreach of executive power.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the court reads it, presidential immunity would stretch to cover every phase of criminal proceedings, including investigations, grand jury proceedings and subpoenas, indictment, prosecution, arrest, trial, conviction, and incarceration,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cThat constitutional protection presumably would encompass any conduct, at any time, in any forum, whether federal or state, and whether the President acted alone or in concert with other individuals.\u201d\n\nThe judge said couldn\u2019t accept that legal view, \u201cespecially in the light of the fundamental concerns over excessive arrogation of power\u201d that led the founding fathers to create a balance of power among the three branches of government.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers and the district attorney\u2019s office did not immediately comment in response to the ruling. Justice Department attorneys in Washington, who had urged Marrero to delay deciding the issue, declined to comment.\n\nVance began his probe after federal prosecutors in New York completed their investigation into payments that Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, arranged to be paid to porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal to keep them silent during the presidential race. The Trump Organization later reimbursed Cohen.\n\nCohen is serving a three-year prison sentence for crimes that included campaign finance violations in connection with the hush money.\n\nTrump was never charged, though prosecutors said publicly that he was aware of and directed the illegal payments. Justice Department policy has long been that sitting presidents cannot be charged criminally.\n\nTrump has steadfastly refused to make his tax returns public, breaking from a tradition set by presidents and presidential candidates decades ago.\n\nGrand jury proceedings and records in New York are secret. If Vance gains access to Trump\u2019s returns through a grand jury investigation, that doesn\u2019t mean that their contents will be disclosed publicly.\n\nIt is unclear what Trump\u2019s returns might have to do with the criminal investigation.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A federal judge has rejected President Donald Trump's challenge to the release of his tax returns for a New York state criminal probe.", "authors": ["Larry Neumeister"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trump-challenge-denied.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
