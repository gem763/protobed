The expert says Pyongyang cyber-criminals are becoming more \u201ctechnologically adroit\u201d in their methods of stealing cryptocurrencies and targeting crypto traders.\n\nSeoul-based cybersecurity consultant Kim Yo-seb told Cryptonews.com,\n\n\u201cThis sort of thing is right up their street. The North\u2019s hackers have been sending out cryptojacking malware and ransomware in email links and attachments \u2013 primarily to South Korean users \u2013 for years. I suppose that developing fake cryptocurrency apps for the wider world is just the next logical step. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked to learn that they are planning a new cryptocurrency-related raid that is yet more technologically adroit.\u201d\n\nA recent blog post from Patrick Wardle, an Apple security specialist and the principal security researcher at Jamf, claimed that the notorious Lazarus hacker group of Pyongyang has created a fake company named JMT Trading, replete with a legitimate-looking website.\n\nThe \u201cfake company\u201d then created what it claimed was an open-source cryptocurrency trading app for Apple computers, and shared it on Github. But Wardle claims that the code in fact contains malware that gives hackers unrestricted access to Mac devices.\n\nWardle told Forbes that the fake company could \u201cgo a step further by contacting administrators and users of cryptocurrency exchanges, asking them to test and review their new app.\u201d If they are successful, said Wardle, they could win the confidence of an \u201cofficial cryptocurrency vendor and start infecting targets.\u201d\n\nKim told Cryptonews.com,\n\n\u201cMost smaller crypto exchanges have very low levels of security. They are low-hanging fruit for professional hackers like these.\u201d\n\nThe North has made no secret of its fast-developing cryptocurrency plans \u2013 with recent claims that it is working on a token of its own, as well as exchanges and wallet services.", "description": "A South Korean security expert says he is \u201cunsurprised\u201d by allegations that hackers from the North have developed a so-called \u201cfake crypto app\u201d that allows them to seize control of computers.
