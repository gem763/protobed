It Was the Worst of Warren.", "language": "en", "text": "The second reason I appreciated this debate was that it vividly framed the fundamental tension in the Democratic field, the fault line separating Warren and Sanders, for example, from Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar, among others.\n\nThe latter group of candidates traffic in measured remedies that are more obviously attainable, prioritizing imperfect, incremental change over grandly transformative proposals that face hurdles galore and very long odds. In their estimation \u2014 in mine, too \u2014 that\u2019s probably the safer agenda with which to do battle against Trump, whose ouster eclipses all other goals. It\u2019s also the best hope for national healing.\n\n\u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d Buttigieg said, specifically explaining why he wasn\u2019t signing on to Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s push for the confiscation of assault weapons but also articulating a general philosophy beyond that. \u201cWe have to just get something done.\u201d\n\nWarren flatly rejected the idea that, in her words, \u201csome vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems\u201d is a winning formula for Democrats. \u201cIf all Democrats can promise is that after Donald Trump it will be business as usual, then we will lose,\u201d she said.\n\nThere was a similar \u2014 and similarly important \u2014 back-and-forth about the Manichaean, truculent language that she uses to talk about Americans on different sides of the economic divide.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. Klobuchar chimed in: \u201cI want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\u201d\n\nShe was referring to Tom Steyer, who was making his Democratic-debate debut.\n\nWarren said that she had nothing against billionaires per se and wasn\u2019t in the demonization business. She was in the justice business. And with her final remarks, she sought to underscore that with praise for a prominent Republican ally of the first President Bush. She also noted that two of her three brothers were Republicans and that she loved them very much.", "description": "Tuesday\u2019s debate \u2014 the tensest yet \u2014 put the Democrats\u2019 newly minted front-runner to the test.", "authors": ["Frank Bruni"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/opinion/16oped2/16oped2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
