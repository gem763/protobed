But until now, the decades-old data has been difficult to access.\n\nDustin Schroeder, foreground, and art historian Jessica Daniel splice decades-old film containing radar measurements of Antarctica into a reel, in preparation for digital scanning, at the Scott Polar Research Institute. (Submitted by Dustin Schroeder)\n\nSchroeder had to manually wind the film reels by hand using vintage equipment that he bought off eBay \u2014 by outbidding \"hipster filmmakers.\"\n\nBut once the film was finally digitized in high resolution, Schroeder says important new details emerged.\n\n\"We are able to directly compare what not only the thickness but the shape of that ice shelf is in the archival data we scanned versus the modern data,\" Schroeder said.\n\n\"We're able to see that in areas it is thinning much more than the average signal you can get by looking at it from satellite.\"\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica has been eaten away from below by a warming of sea waters around the frozen continent. (NASA/Reuters)\n\nSchroeder says the next step is to use these new measurements to try to understand how the ice sheet will respond \u2014 and is already responding \u2014 to rapid changes in climate.\n\n\"We know already that one of the big drivers of change in the entire region where Thwaites exists is warm ocean water melting ice shelves and the grounding lines of ice sheets,\" Schroeder said.\n\n\"We take those observations, including observations people are making in Antarctica now, and put those into ice sheet models to make projections of how the ice sheets will evolve.\"\n\nSchroeder says those projections will be even more accurate when referenced against the newly digitized archival films.\n\n\"[It] gives you a much finer scale process to observe, understand, model and reproduce than the sort of average measurement you got from satellite altimetry over the whole area.\"\n\nHundreds of rolls of vintage film had to be condensed into 75 reels before they could be digitally scanned. (Submitted by Dustin Schroeder)\n\nThe films may confirm an even harsher reality of the effects of climate change, but Schroeder says we're lucky the archive exists and that ultimately the study gives him hope.\n\n\"[It's] a real privilege to be tactilely touching and archiving and preserving the foundational measurements of my field. That's inspiring,\" Schroeder said.\n\n\"The fact that we were lucky enough to get this snapshot of one of the most dynamically changing parts of one of the most important potentially unstable glaciers gives me a lot of comfort and hope that we will get those numbers better and we will be able to make plans and take actions as a society.\"\n\nWritten by John McGill and Kate Cornick.
