But he was happy to feed the assembled media a few tidbits of information about some of his big stars and upcoming plans during the post-fight press conference at Bellator 232.\n\nCoker fielded an array of questions about a host of his promotion\u2019s stars, plus one notable name not currently on the Bellator roster, as he revealed his plans for a number of his big-name athletes in the coming months.\n\nLet\u2019s take a run through the key takeaways from Coker\u2019s press conference comments:\n\n\u2018The Gooch\u2019 is coming back to the U.S.\n\nTwo-promotion bantamweight champion Kyoji Horiguchi is all set for action for Rizin FF on New Year\u2019s Eve, but Coker said he hopes to get the Japanese star \u2013 and current Bellator 135-pound champion \u2013 into the Bellator cage early in 2020.\n\n\u201cWhen he defends his belt, it\u2019s going to be here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd probably some time in the second quarter, or actually the first quarter, of next year, because I found out the Rizin schedule. They\u2019re not going to do a promotion until April. He\u2019s going to fight on New Year\u2019s Eve and maybe in February we\u2019ll get him to fight for us, here in the U.S.\u201d\n\nSergio Pettis will fight at bantamweight\n\nCoker said that Bellator\u2019s newest signing, former UFC flyweight contender Sergio Pettis, will compete at 135 pounds, though he hasn\u2019t locked in an opponent for the Milwaukee fighter just yet.\n\n\u201cWe have a 135-pound weight class, and I think that\u2019s what we agreed upon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to confirm that with Rich (Chou, Bellator matchmaker) and the guys, but that\u2019s what I believe.\u201d\n\nAnd when Leandro Higo was floated by one media member as someone who has already offered to face Pettis first, Coker looked intrigued.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that I\u2019m not going to commit to, that fight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something that could be on the table, but there\u2019s a lot of good fights in that weight class now. We\u2019re beefing up that 135-pound weight class, and we\u2019re going to mix it up and pick the right fights when it\u2019s time.\u201d", "description": "Scott Coker covered a host of bases as he talked shop with reporters backstage at the Bellator 232 post-fight press conference.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Blue Corner", "Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan", "John Morgan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/scott-coker-bellator-japan.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
