When they sent it to be x-rayed they saw objects that 'appeared to be a human shape.'\n\nInside custom agents found three glass containers allegedly holding three human fetuses.\n\nThe package also contained a hand-written letter from Cain apologizing for the delay and offering the recipient a free t-shirt.\n\nThe t-shirt was printed with a picture of a 'Purgatory Museum' and the phrase 'Real Shrunken Head.'\n\nThe card had the name: 'G. Howard McGinty Director and Curator of McGinty Fine Oddities' on it.\n\nAccording to the company's website, McGinty Fine Oddities appears to have peculiar objects like shrunken heads, wet specimens, mummies and skeletons among other objects.\n\nAuthorities found finger prints for Glenn McGinty of McGinty Fine Oddities in the UK, a curator that has objects like shrunken heads, were found on the package\n\nAfterwards, the remains were collected by the San Mateo County Coroner's Office for further examination and the remains were confirmed as human fetuses.\n\nAfter the initial discovery, fingerprints were found on the box belonging to Cain and Glenn McGinty.\n\nDuring this time, Cain contacted the USPS customer service line on October 30 from Colorado.\n\nShe asked why her package was being held in San Francisco and told the phone teller that the package's recipient was 'getting a little antsy.'\n\nCain (pictured), who allegedly tried to sell four specimens on Facebook for $20,000, was arrested and released on a $5,000 bond\n\nCain called USPS customer service three days later to once again check on her package's status.\n\nMeanwhile, investigators were able to search Cain's Facebook and discovered she tried to sell the specimens on her Facebook page prior to the incident.\n\nCain 'informed another Facebook user that she recently acquired a collection of three fetal wet specimens and one fetal skeleton wet specimen from a university lab collection,' according to 9 News.\n\nThe post allegedly contained seven photos and explained she would sell all four specimens for $20,000.\n\nCain posted on her Facebook: 'We don\u2019t always post publicly. Especially with pieces like these ...' and '... too controversial to be up everywhere, for everyone to see. I try to keep them for the special clients and others we know may have interest in them.'\n\nShe gained access to the university lab, revealed to be the Department of Medical Education at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, through a female friend who was head of the biomed department.\n\nShe picked up the fetuses from a U-Hail trailer.\n\nUniversity officials said their policy is to cremate, not sell specimens, and that they are cooperating with federal officials.\n\nCain was arrested by authorities in Fort Collins and released on a $5,000 bond.\n\nFor her crime she will potentially be charged under U.S. Code \u00a7 289g\u20132, which says it is unlawful to 'knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration.'\n\nCain has been required to wear a GPS monitor.\n\nDailyMail.com contacted Cain's attorney for further comment.", "description": "Emily Suzanne Cain, 38, of Fort Collins, Colorado is accused by federal authorities of attempting to mail three human fetuses from the U.S. to Westminster in England in 2018", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/16/19845044-0-image-a-26_1571326045187.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
