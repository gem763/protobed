On Nov. 10, they will play the winner of Wednesday night's Eastern Conference final between Atlanta United and Toronto FC. If Atlanta wins, it would host MLS Cup, while Seattle would play host if Toronto captures the East title.\n\nIt was a difficult defeat for Los Angeles, which set an MLS record with 72 points during a 21-4-9 regular season.\n\nLAFC's Carlos Vela, who scored a league-record 34 goals in the regular season and added two more in a 5-3 playoff victory against the rival Los Angeles Galaxy last week, was kept off the scoresheet. Eduard Atuesta scored the lone goal for the Black & Gold.\n\nLeading 2-1 at the half, the Sounders got an insurance goal by Ruidiaz in the 64th minute. A long pass down the left wing was chested down by LAFC defender Walker Zimmerman, with ball falling directly to Lodeiro. He found an open Ruidiaz in the middle of the field, and Ruidiaz's 18-yard shot skimmed just inside the left post, past diving goalkeeper Tyler Miller.\n\nLos Angeles opened the scoring in the 17th minute after Vela was fouled about 25 yards out. Both Vela and Atuesta stood over the free kick to fake out the Sounders before Atuesta curled the ball just inside the left post and out of the reach of goalkeeper Stefan Frei.\n\nThe lead didn't last long.\n\nSeattle tied it in the 22nd minute as Ruidiaz took a pass from Lodeiro in the middle of the field near the top of the arc atop the 18-yard box. Ruidiaz made a nifty move past one defender and blistered a 15-yard shot into the upper right corner of the net, leaving Miller nearly flat-footed. Jordan Morris also got an assist on the goal.\n\nThe Sounders took the lead just four minutes later on what started as a three-on-two break. Midfielder Joevin Jones, wide on the right wing, waited to make a cross and found Lodeiro trailing the play. Lodeiro's low, 22-yard shot skipped just inside the right post to make it 2-1.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Raul Ruidiaz scored twice and Nicolas Lodeiro added a goal and two assists as  the visiting Seattle Sounders upset host Los Angeles FC 3-1 Tuesday night in ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
