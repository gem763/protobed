Of course I would be able to help her with her shopping! Let\u2019s get this shopping-helping show on the road, I wanted to shout. For I am an excellent person and enthusiastic assistant to those in need. Unfortunately, it turned out she didn\u2019t mean shopping as a metonym for shopping bags, but shopping as in the verb. She had not yet been to the shop. This was not me lifting two Lidl bags and carrying them to the bus stop, as I had envisioned; this was me going to Lidl.\n\nForty-five minutes later, this wily elder of mine \u2013 who had also swindled me out of \u00a33 by this point and made a fair few comments I would describe as racist \u2013let me know that she lived on the top floor of a block of flats but, not to worry, because the block was only a mile or so away. Despite all this \u2013 \u201cthis\u201d being the entire afternoon \u2013 I still feel contented that I helped this lady out, even if I have avoided her since.\n\nGood deeds are considered selfless, but they are often not. This is because a fair number of good deeds take minimal effort; the effort is outweighed by the feeling of self-satisfaction. If anything, it is pure human profit, and as such perhaps not altruistic at all. (There are, of course, the times when we go above and beyond, when we inconvenience ourselves for others. I can summon up many occasions when friends, all over the world and in all seasons, have gone above and beyond for me.)\n\nWhen you\u2019re a regular, you\u2019re a VIP | Hannah Jane Parkinson Read more\n\nBut mostly it\u2019s something that, for you, takes very little, but can make all the difference to another. The teenage girl frantic in a strange city who asks for directions, or to borrow your phone. Lifting someone\u2019s suitcases down station stairs or grabbing one end of a frazzled mother\u2019s pram, its inhabitant blotchy-faced and screaming. Tapping a rushed businessman on the shoulder to return his wallet.\n\nI truly believe the whole world would collapse without these interactions, or to use the American argot: the act of paying it forward. In fact, one doesn\u2019t need to be the do-gooder or the recipient to be warmed by an act of kindness. Even reading about them can be a joy. Do a good deed today, then \u2013 even if it\u2019s just holding a door open. And I will do one for someone in turn. As long as it\u2019s not their entire weekly shop.
