Now, according to new research, there may be a reason to examine alcohol-related offenses as a precursor to partner violence, too.\n\nGun purchasers with prior convictions for driving under the influence were nearly three times more likely to be arrested in the future for domestic partner violence than gun purchasers who had no criminal history at the time of purchase, a study published Monday in the journal Health Affairs found.\n\nThe study utilized data from nearly 80,000 people between the ages of 21 and 49, who purchased a legal handgun in California in 2001.\n\n(MORE: 'We've seen too damn many' mass shootings in Texas: Sen. Ted Cruz)\n\n\"It shows very, very clearly that prior criminal history predicts future criminal history,\" Dr. Megan Ranney, professor at Brown University and chief research officer at the gun violence research group AFFIRM, told ABC News.\n\n\"People who have a tendency for risky behavior, continue to have a tendency for risky behavior,\" said Ranney, who was not connected to the new study.\n\nPredicting risky behavior with firearms is particularly important in the context of intimate partner violence, Ranney explained, since victims are five times more likely to die if an abuser has access to a gun. Even when women don\u2019t die, guns are a persistent threat to their collective safety and well-being. Nearly 1 million women say they\u2019ve been shot at by an intimate partner at some point in their lives, and 4.5 million who report being bullied or coerced with a gun.\n\nPHOTO: In this Dec. 21, 2108, file photo, handguns for sale are lined up in a display case in a gun shop.

While researchers have documented the connection between guns and intimate partner violence, and alcohol and intimate partner violence, there\u2019s been less attention paid to the nexus of the three factors together, Laqueur, who is also an assistant professor at UC Davis Health, said.\n\nIn California, new research may prove to be more than hypothetical.\n\n(MORE: 6 in 10 fear a mass shooting; most think gun laws can help: POLL)\n\nA 2013 bill that passed in the state would have prohibited firearm sales for 10 years to people who had two or more DUI convictions during a three-year period. The governor vetoed the bill at the time, on the basis that there wasn\u2019t enough evidence linking non-violent crimes committed without a firearm to violent firearm crimes. A similar proposal was floated this year, citing a smaller UC Davis study with older data, that didn\u2019t specifically examine intimate partner violence.\n\nIf the bill is put forth again next year, there\u2019s much more robust data for policymakers to pull from.\n\n\"Given evidence that people who consume alcohol are at increased risk of violence, and intimate partner violence in particular, regulating firearm access may afford an important public health opportunity to reduce the risk and severity of that violence 10-year prohibition on firearm sales,\" the study authors wrote.\n\nPHOTO: In this undated file photo, crime Scene tape at the front door of a luxury home.
