She said more than half of the francophone schools in the province need serious renovations or repairs.\n\nFrancophone board asked N.L. not to intervene in case\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador's francophone school board was the only standalone board in Canada to submit an intervener's factum. Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories also appeared as interveners.\n\nNew Brunswick, Canada's only officially bilingual province, decided not to act as an intervener in the Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique v. British Columbia case, telling Radio-Canada that its interests were already being well represented by several Acadian groups that chose to participate in the proceedings.\n\nChristianson said she asked the province not to intervene in the case and the province refused.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments last Thursday in Winnipeg. After the proceedings, the court reserved its decision, meaning it will deliver a decision at a later date.", "description": "Governments in three Atlantic Canadian provinces say financial constraints should justify violations of minority-language education rights guaranteed under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5131093.1557504061!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/canada-senate.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
