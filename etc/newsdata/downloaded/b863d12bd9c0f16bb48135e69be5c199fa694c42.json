The father made known he wished to block Georgulas from placing their son on puberty blockers and begin the \u201ctransition\u201d process.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers seized on the outrage expressed by many in the nation over the notion that a parent would make the decision to consider placing a child on puberty blockers when he is cognitively unable to comprehend the consequences of that action at his age.\n\nState Rep. Matt Krause, for example, tweeted he will \u201cintroduce legislation that prohibits the use of puberty blockers in these situations for children under 18\u2033:\n\nAbsent a special session between now & the the 87th Session, I will introduce legislation that prohibits the use of puberty blockers in these situations for children under 18. We missed our opportunity to do so in the 86th Session. We won\u2019t miss the next one. #savejamesyounger https://t.co/BpbGDPwujZ \u2014 Matt Krause (@RepMattKrause) October 24, 2019\n\n\u201cWe missed our opportunity to do so in the 86th Session,\u201d he added. \u201cWe won\u2019t miss the next one.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Jared Patterson echoed Krause\u2019s plan:\n\nI look forward to working with you on that! \u2014 Rep. Jared Patterson (@JaredLPatterson) October 24, 2019\n\nState Rep. Steve Toth tweeted his first bill to file in the 87th Session \u201cwill add \u2018Transitioning of a Minor\u2019 as Child Abuse\u201d:\n\nThe 1st bill I file in the 87th will add \u201cTransitioning Of a Minor\u201d as Child Abuse. Upwards of 500 minors are being transitioned in TX\n\nWe didn\u2019t protect these children in the 86th\n\nThe wrath of Texans will be heard in the 87th.\n\nTexas will step up to #SaveJamesYounger \u2014 Steve Toth (@Toth_4_Texas) October 26, 2019\n\n\u201cUpwards of 500 minors are being transitioned in TX,\u201d Toth tweeted. \u201cWe didn\u2019t protect these children in the 86th.

We collect parent stories like this, and have a leader in Texas with a group of parents ready to help you.\u201d\n\nThank you for this important legislation.

Gov. Dan Patrick observed, \u201cWe have to look out for the health care and well-being of children.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always pass policy to protect children, and there\u2019s no rhyme or reason that a 7-year-old should go through psychological training to become a boy or a girl opposite to what they were born,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not right, and the people know that.\u201d\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton called on the state\u2019s Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) to investigate \u201cpossible child abuse against seven-year-old James Younger, whose mother has proposed chemically and surgically altering his biological sex based on her belief that he may identify as a girl\u201d:\n\n\u201cTexans understand that children\u2026should be supported and properly cared for as they grow up in our communities.
