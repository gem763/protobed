Family farming also plays a critical role for global food production. In Brazil, they are responsible for 70% of domestic food consumption.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Felled timber is also another source of income and another driver for deforestation\n\nBy showing that the land could be harvested sustainably and profitably, the land owners were less inclined to sell up to industrial cattle and soy producers, Dr de Souza said. This would allow local communities to thrive and slow the relentless mark of deforestation in the region.\n\nHowever, the current political situation in the country is making it hard for researchers and NGOs, such as the Instituto Ouro Verde, to operate and continue their work against deforestation.\n\nBleak outlook\n\nIn August, Germany and Norway announced they would suspend money going to the Amazon Fund, a multi-million dollar global effort to tackle deforestation in the region.\n\nPoliticians from the two European nations said the Brazilian government, headed by President Jair Bolsonaro, was backing policies that favoured deforestation and was actively pursuing ways to hamper pro-rainforest projects.\n\nSources on the ground in the Amazon told BBC News that frozen funds, political persecution and misinformation were \"definitely undermining\" the work that had been built for decades.\n\nData from Brazil's National Space Research Institute suggests that deforestation for 2019 is up at least 75% on the previous 12 months.\n\nProf Pennington said: \"A lot of that soy [grown on an industrial scale] is coming back to the European Union and to China for animal feed, so we're all implicated in that food chain.\n\n\"These massive agricultural businesses are problematic environmentally in many ways.\n\n\"They're extremely high input in terms of pesticides, which they're spraying aerially, and the chemicals are getting into water supplies.\n\n\"In this part of Brazil, when the area was originally opened up, it was really opened up to a lot of smallholders.\"\n\nBut Prof Pennington explained that, increasingly, the land was being bought by large agri-businesses, who offered the smallholders very good money, which was very hard to refuse.\n\n\"But it doesn't just have to be massive cattle ranches or massive soybean plantations,\" he added.\n\n\"There are opportunities for people to have smaller pieces of land that are financially viable for them to have an income and a lifestyle that they feel is more healthy and that they're happy with.\"", "description": "Trees that help keep soils fertile could slow deforestation in Brazil's \"arc of destruction\".", "authors": ["Mark Kinver", "Environment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2B04/production/_109421011_untitled.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
