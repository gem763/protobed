The accused, who worked as a poker dealer at the Winning Hand Poker Room, was then removed from the bowling alley and fired.\n\n'He wouldn't give [his phone] to me. He sat down on the toilet, said \"It's not what you think, it's not what you think,\"' Berry said at Gaynier's preliminary hearing in August.\n\nPolice were able to seize Gaynier's cell phone, where they found 150 video clips that 'contained images of the reporting victim and other unknown male victims urinating and appeared to have been taken from an adjacent bathroom stall'.\n\nPolice were called to the Woodhaven Bowl-a-Rama (pictured) on December 14 when Justin Berry reported seeing a phone appear out of a nearby stall\n\n'He's completely shamed. He's shamed [by] the entire community, they're getting a kick out of this, they just love this', his lawyer said on Tuesday. 'He's a broken man, and he knows he's going away today -- the question is, for how long?'\n\n'We can still have a speedy resolution in this case, unless [prosecution] want to dig in, and now punish him for now perhaps taking one or two extra court hearings'.\n\nGaynier will return to court for a Dispositional Conference on October 22.", "description": "Police were called to the\u00a0Woodhaven Bowl-a-Rama in Michigan on\u00a0December 14 when\u00a0a man reported seeing a phone appear out of a nearby stall when he was using the bathroom.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19497352-0-image-a-26_1570633429243.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
