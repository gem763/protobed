To better explain his thoughts on the matter, he compared the crypto asset to artwork, comic books and baseball cards:\n\n\u201cDid you ever see someone who collected baseball cards? And they were really, really, really proud of their baseball cards because they kept saying they were going to go up in price? Comic books \u2014 same thing, even artwork. There\u2019s no real intrinsic value, you can\u2019t eat a baseball card [...] Your artwork might look good on the wall but not much you can do with it. Bitcoin \u2014 there\u2019s even less you can do with it: at least I can look at my baseball card [...] I can look at artwork.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is like gold, it\u2019s like a religion\n\nCuban then raised the concern that Bitcoin is too complicated for the average person, given the great number of options for its storage and theft prevention needs. This is where he notes that Bitcoin, often called digital gold, is actually really like gold:\n\n\u201cI say it\u2019s like gold. Gold is a religion: people who are really into gold \u2014 they\u2019ll tell you that there\u2019s a bad depression and things go to hell in a handbasket, if you own gold then you\u2019ll be okay. No, you won\u2019t! You carry around a gold bar \u2014 someone\u2019s gonna hit your ass, knock you out and steal your gold bar and it\u2019s gonna happen again and again and again. I\u2019d rather have bananas, I can eat bananas. Crypto\u2026 Not so much.\u201d\n\nThis idea is in line with what Cuban said in August when he noted that Bitcoin is fundamentally similar to gold and defined them both as collectibles.\n\nCuban did admit that he is not \u201cagainst cryptocurrencies\u201d \u2014 however, he warned investors to be very careful as, at best, they\u2019re stored value.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported in July, Cuban defined Facebook\u2019s Libra stablecoin as a big mistake. He noted that \u201cglobally and in countries where there isn\u2019t a lot of rules of law, or a lot of government stability, or currency stability, then it could be dangerous.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI\u2019d rather have bananas,\u201d says billionaire technology investor Mark Cuban about gold and Bitcoin", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9jYTY5ZGVhOTFhMDJjMmNiOWZhNjFmNzdmZWU3MDRiMC5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
