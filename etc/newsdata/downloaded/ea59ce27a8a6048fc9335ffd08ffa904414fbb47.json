Now we\u2019re turning our Art Club into an interview series in which we catch up with the artists and designers we admire and find out what drives them.\n\nIn 2014 when I first moved to New York, I visited the Brooklyn Museum and saw the exhibit Submerged Motherlands. It was a dreamlike, larger-than-life experience created by the artist Swoon, who first gained notoriety in the early 2000s as a street artist. The intense detail and scale of every piece astounded me, and I\u2019ve been following her work ever since.\n\nSwoon, born Caledonia Curry, has been experimenting and challenging herself for almost 20 years. Since studying at Pratt Institute, she\u2019s been creating massive installations for galleries as well as engaging in humanitarian efforts. Her work with the Konbit Shelter in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake helped create a sustainable community center and single-family houses in Cormier, Haiti.\n\nSwoon invited me into her studio space in Brooklyn to talk about the link between street art and studio work, the messy process of drawing, and taking her artwork out to sea.\n\nWhat was the transition from street artist to studio artist like?\n\nI always had a studio practice, since I was a little kid. I studied classical painting, and even when I was doing work that was really made to live out in the street, most of the time making it was spent in my studio. So the real question was just around, \u201cwhere does the art live?\u201d At first I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to just make a square that goes over a couch.\u201d And now, I\u2019ve gotten to the place where I\u2019ve threaded through so many layers of meaning and life into my work that I\u2019m okay if one aspect of it is also a square over a couch. Like this is a portrait that\u2019s part of a larger process, and if there\u2019s a piece of it you can keep, that\u2019s awesome.\n\nI actually prefer that to only having things disappear. It\u2019s nice to have a dual trajectory. So the studio process was always there, it was really more about the transition from street to gallery museum. At the time when I first got asked to do that, it was like, \u201cOkay, does this really make sense? Is this right for me?\u201d And then as you saw at the Brooklyn Museum, we had this 70-foot tree that was guy-wired into the building. Now you could see them up close, whereas they had just been on the water before. So what I found is that there are certain things that can happen in those protected spaces.\n\nDo you plan to do any more street art?\n\nRight now I\u2019m taking a break because [with] every piece I was making, I was always thinking that it had to live out in the street. It was starting to dictate what I was making in a certain way and I was like, \u201cYou know what? If I\u2019m going to really evolve creatively, I have to actually pause some of the things that are my known go-tos, so that I can surprise myself a little bit.\u201d Like I have to stop doing certain things that are comfortable in order to get uncomfortable, which is that really creative space.\n\nWhat piece are you most proud of?\n\nThe piece that I\u2019m most proud of right now is this piece called the Medea. It did something that no work of art that I\u2019ve ever made has ever done. I was able to start with a psychological state that I myself was in, which was kind of like a cognitive, dissociative, like fragmented place that was related to memory and childhood trauma and all kinds of things.\n\nAnd then I was able to \u2014 through the creation of the piece to make physical the process of fragmentation of the mind \u2014 to braid it back together and to bring it back into cohesion. I know that sounds really abstract and complicated, but it\u2019s one of those things where you\u2019re like, \u201cOh fuck, this is what a work of art can do.\u201d It can let you do these things which feel really abstract and complicated and a bit nebulous, but sort of concretizes them. There\u2019s what your brain is doing and there\u2019s what your hand is doing, and then bringing in stories, drawings, myths, and all different kinds of things. Somehow it allows a little bit of alchemy to happen.\n\nWho\u2019s been your biggest inspiration?\n\nI love this nun named Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n. She\u2019s a Buddhist nun and she is really quite remarkable in that she\u2019s able to study Buddhism, get into the depth of the whole Buddhist canon and then to translate it into completely ordinary terms. I feel like where I\u2019m at as an artist right now is kind of drilling down into the human experience and drilling down into consciousness itself. Nobody does that better than the Buddhists. I\u2019ve just binge-listened to almost everything, plus I read The Places That Scare You and I just love her. She got me meditating. I meditate daily, I do like 10-day retreats every year.\n\nCan you take me through the process of creating one of your portraits?\n\nIt depends on the specific portrait. Sometimes I just catch something candidly. I don\u2019t do any digital transfer, I just draw from the photograph. I found that if I don\u2019t just draw it freehand, it won\u2019t be wrong enough to feel like my drawing.\n\nLike if I lay it out and just copy it, it\u2019s a little too like everyone else who lays it out and copies it. But when I do my own drawing, there is something that I never quite get right and that becomes the style of why you recognize that that\u2019s my piece. I just believe in the dedicated act of looking that happens when you just try and try again to draw someone\u2019s face, and you erase it, and you try again, and you look deeper and you struggle with that. I just feel like that is why we are making drawings in the first place rather than taking a video or taking a photograph. Like that\u2019s why drawers draw. That\u2019s why I draw.\n\nAfter you start that process, what\u2019s the actual physical process to getting it blown up?\n\nWell all the block prints, that\u2019s their scale. So I roll out the linoleum and then I draw with charcoal on the linoleum, and then I solidify the drawing with ink so that I know exactly where I\u2019m carving. And then once I start carving, I almost shut my brain and put on a Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n book or whoever, and just get in the zone of carving while the decisions have been made. And then [after you] print it out, you have to kind of go back and wrestle the drawing back out of the print. Lately, I\u2019ve started doing silkscreens from the drawings because I\u2019m starting to stop some of my processes, so that I can learn new things like stop-motion animation.\n\nSo the installation like Submerged Motherlands, how long did that take you to put together?\n\nSo long. Yeah, that was at least six months. And, in fact, more because you saw there were two rafts in the project and those had been built years before. So the tree, the temple, a lot of those drawings had been coming into fruition for like a decade. It took six months to get it prefabricated and get it put up. But to really examine the labor that went into it, I would say it took like a decade.\n\nTalking about the boats, what was it like making a piece of art that floats? Were you scared at all the first time you rode it?\n\nYeah. I mean it was really astonishing in this way where, we did it, we built it. But still the feeling of being out on it floating, you were like, \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d And driving it? You\u2019re like, \u201cOh my god, I am driving my art at sea.\u201d Just a wild feeling. Also like stepping away, like getting on the little skiff and driving out and seeing it. The first time that happened I was like, \u201cAre you fucking kidding me, that\u2019s what we did?\u201d Like even I had been doing it for months. Seeing it be alive on water was just totally mind blowing.\n\nJumping back to what you were saying about exploring techniques, what are you currently obsessed with technique-wise or style-wise?\n\nWell, I\u2019m obsessed with learning moving storytelling. I\u2019m not working with narratives so much as I\u2019m starting with an image and letting a narrative build out of the image. But what I\u2019m finding is that as soon as you introduce time, everything is a story in a way. Like you\u2019re a motion graphics person, you probably know that. That there\u2019s this funny magic that happens where once you expand in time, it\u2019s like a whole other ballgame.\n\nBecause I\u2019ve worked in narrative drawings for so long, I\u2019m finding that the transition is completely natural. And I feel like a little kid in this way, like, \u201cOh my god, this is so fun.\u201d Playing with it and seeing where it goes is what I\u2019m obsessed with right now.\n\nI\u2019m definitely always trying to learn some kind of new technique or something. That\u2019s my favorite part of the job when you don\u2019t know how to do something.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly why I had to put down a bunch of my processes because I didn\u2019t have enough time doing things I was confused about.\n\nI definitely feel like when I\u2019ve worked on something for so long, it\u2019s so muscle memory. It\u2019s like, why am I doing this?\n\nYeah, it can become great, but yeah, then there\u2019s a point in which you have to put it down or change or come back to it when you\u2019ve learned something else.\n\nSo, what\u2019s next?\n\nI\u2019m going into seclusion for the summer to work on more stop-motion. I have a really hard time doing that in New York and so I\u2019ve been living for part of the year in rural Panama and that\u2019s where I do my film work. I have a feeling that I\u2019m going to start around this experience that I had when my mom passed away. I had something that\u2019s called a shared death experience which is quite strange and a bit mystical. When I learned that it wasn\u2019t just me who had that experience, I was really stoked about that. I have long thought about how to express that experience and so I might take a crack at doing that in film.", "description": "Swoon, born Caledonia Curry, has been experimenting and challenging herself for almost 20 years.
