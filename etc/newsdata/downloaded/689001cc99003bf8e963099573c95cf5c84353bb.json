for the city of Napa. \u201cWe're encouraging our community to be as prepared as possible.\u201d\n\nThat outage will also affect portions of the agricultural Central Valley, the state's northern and central coasts and the Sierra Nevada foothills where a November wildfire blamed on PG&E transmission lines killed 85 people and devastated the town of Paradise.\n\nJennifer Siemens, who lost her home in Paradise, rents a house in the nearby town of Oroville and said she is bracing for a third blackout in a month.\n\nSiemens was preparing by having her car gassed up, stocking up with bottled water and flashlights and making sure all of the family's electronic devices were fully charged.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please

They also rushed to stores to buy flashlights, ice chests and batteries.\n\nPG&E said it planned to update customers by text message and email to Tuesday where and when the power would be cut off. Its website, where people could check whether their addresses would be affected, was down Tuesday afternoon after being overloaded with visitors. In Southern California, the largest numbers of potentially affected customers were in Los Angeles County and to the east in San Bernardino and Riverside counties.\n\nWinds can knock down live wires and power poles or drive trees and other vegetation into contact with them \u2014 and some of California's most destructive blazes in recent years were started by PG&E power lines.\n\nBut the potential planned outages will not be limited to fire-prone areas because the utilities must turn off entire distribution and transmission lines to much wider areas to minimise the risk of wildfires.\n\nPublic agencies throughout the region were urging people to prepare by buying water and non-perishable food, getting a full tank of gas, having cash at hand and parking vehicles outside garages or making sure they know how to manually open their garage doors.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention said it increased staffing in preparation for extreme fire weather and what was expected to be the strongest wind event so far this fire season.\n\n\u201cWith some of the most destructive and deadliest fires occurring October through December, we need Californians to not be complacent,\u201d said California Fire Chief Thom Porter in a news release. \u201cResidents need to be ready to evacuate at a moment's notice in the event of a wildfire.\u201d\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, Sonoma County Sheriff's Sergeant Juan Valencia said his office was ready to notify residents of outages through emergency alerts and social media as soon as it received word.\n\n\u201cWe don't know what the extent of the public safety and power shut-off is going to be, so we're just going to have to adapt,\u201d he said Tuesday.\n\nOakland Mayor Libby Schaaf asked residents Tuesday not to clog 911 lines with non-emergencies and urged people to be prepared. In 1991, a grass fire torched the Oakland Hills, killing 25 people and destroying more than 3,000 homes. The city cancelled all officers' days off in preparation for the outages.\n\n\u201cWe all know the devastation that fires can cause,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the Dollar General store in Paradise, people were buying candles, gas cans, ice, flashlights, batteries and canned food and the store ran out of ice chests Tuesday morning, said manager Ben Humphries.\n\nHumphries, who moved to Oroville with his family after losing his home in Paradise, said his family lost power two times already in the last month and he was making sure they had enough fuel for their generator and plenty of ice in coolers.\n\nBut he said there was a sense of irony to PG&E's aggressive action in the area now, after the company opted to not to turn off the power ahead of the November 8 fire that wiped out the town of Paradise.\n\n\u201cI understand their concerns but in my opinion it's too little too late, we already had our town burned to the ground,\u201d Humphries said.\n\nAP", "description": "Two years to the day after some of the deadliest wildfires tore through Northern California wine country, a utility announced on Tuesday it will shut off power to more than 800,000 customers in the largest preventive outage in state history -\u00a0to try to prevent wildfires caused by faulty power lines.", "authors": ["Olga R Rodriquez", "Janie Har"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/08/21/cali-fire-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
