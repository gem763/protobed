Yet as this report underlines, Samoa, Tonga and Fiji are all facing increased risks from rising sea levels and extreme weather.\"\n\nImage copyright GABRIEL BOUYS\n\nChristian Aid says that the way that Pacific islands are treated on climate change reflects the way that world rugby has treated these countries when it comes to their best rugby players.\n\nCurrent stars like England's Manu Tuilagi or Ireland's Bundee Aki both have Samoan connections but have moved to play with richer nations.\n\nThis is a pathway littered with greats including former internationals Jonah Lomu and Lote Tuquiri, who played for New Zealand and Australia respectively.\n\nRugby's governing body World Rugby had even developed plans for a new global championship which would have excluded teams from Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. In the face of serious opposition the plans were ultimately dropped.\n\nThe report says that the disdain with which larger countries hold the Pacific islands is also shown when it comes to climate change.\n\nAt a regional political gathering in August this year, several of the participating countries had pushed Australia to go further on limiting coal to prevent dangerous climate change.\n\nHowever, the Australian deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, brusquely dismissed the concerns.\n\n\"I also get a little bit annoyed when we have people in those sorts of countries pointing the finger at Australia and say we should be shutting down all our resources sector so that, you know, they will continue to survive,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Ireland's Bundee Aki, who has Samoan heritage, could be one of the stars of this World Cup\n\n\"They'll continue to survive because many of their workers come here and pick our fruit.\"\n\nThe World Cup kicks off a couple of days before the UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres convenes a special summit in New York to see if countries will commit to greater action on climate change.\n\nJapan and Australia won't be allowed to speak at the meeting, according to news reports, as their continued support for coal clashes with Mr Guterres view that no new coal fired power plants should be built.\n\n\"The main culprits for causing the climate crisis are European nations as well as major coal burners like Australia, the USA and Japan,\" said report author Dr Katherine Kramer.\n\n\"Not only have they caused the current dire situation, but they are dragging their feet on making the needed transition to a zero-carbon economy.\"\n\nFormer Samoan international Jonny Fa'amatuainu urged players who had connections to the island nations to draw attention to the issue of climate change during the World Cup.\n\n\"Pacific islanders representing other countries at the Rugby World Cup, I urge you to use that platform to help with the climate challenge,\" he said.\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter.", "description": "Pacific nations bearing brunt of climate inaction by Australia, US and hosts Japan says Christian Aid study.", "authors": ["Matt Mcgrath", "Environment Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/EF5B/production/_108857216_gettyimages-1173002876.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
