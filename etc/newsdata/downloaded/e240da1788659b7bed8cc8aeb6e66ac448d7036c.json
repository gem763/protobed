Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics In Washington alleged that foreign governments and domestic officials were patronizing Trump Organization properties in New York and Washington to curry favor with the president, giving Mr. Trump an unfair competitive advantage against hotels and restaurants in the same marketplace.\n\n\u201cThe Complaint sufficiently alleges that Plaintiffs compete directly with Trump establishments and that the President\u2019s allegedly illegal acts favor Plaintiffs\u2019 competitors,\u201d wrote Second Circuit Judge Pierre Leval in an opinion joined by Circuit Judge Christopher Droney.\n\nThe ruling allows the case to go forward, but didn\u2019t address key questions in the cases: what the writers of the Constitution meant by the term \u201cemolument\u201d and whether government payments to Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses are constitutional violations.\n\nBut in refusing to dismiss the lawsuit, the Second Circuit parted ways with the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., which ruled in July that the state of Maryland and the District of Columbia lacked standing to bring emoluments claims against Mr. Trump. The division raises the possibility of Supreme Court intervention.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2014which represents Mr. Trump in the case because he is acting in his official capacity as president\u2014declined to comment.\n\nDeepak Gupta, who represents the plaintiffs, hailed Friday\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cThe Framers of the Constitution wrote the Emoluments Clause to ensure our elected leaders wouldn\u2019t be corrupted by foreign governments,\u201d Mr. Gupta tweeted on Friday. \u201cToday\u2019s historic victory in the Second Circuit gives us the opportunity to continue the fight to ensure their vision remains alive.\u201d\n\nCircuit Judge John Walker Jr. wrote a dissenting opinion in the ruling. Both he and U.S. District Judge George Daniels, author of the 2017 ruling that was overturned on Friday, thought that the allegations of competitive injury were too speculative and that the emoluments questions raised in the case are better handled by Congress instead of the courts.\n\n\u201c[T]his case is deeply political and thus finds itself in an area where federal courts ought to tread lightly,\u201d wrote Judge Walker.\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics In Washington dropped out of the New York case as a plaintiff. The organization is counsel to the remaining plaintiffs: Restaurant Opportunities Centers United and Eric Goode, co-owner of the Bowery Hotel, Waverly Inn and other establishments in Manhattan.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is also deciding whether to revive another emoluments lawsuit brought by 200 House and Senate Democrats.\n\nMr. Trump turned over day-to-day control of his businesses to his two older sons, but he maintains ownership.\n\nSince Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Trump International Hotel in Washington has hosted a series of foreign visitors. The Trump Organization has said it donated more than $340,000 in profits it received from foreign governments in 2017 and 2018 to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThe company has declined to specify how it calculates its foreign profits.\n\nWrite to Jacob Gershman at jacob.gershman@wsj.com and Joe Palazzolo at joe.palazzolo@wsj.com", "description": "A federal appeals court in New York revived a lawsuit that alleges President Trump is unconstitutionally profiting from his presidency.", "authors": ["Jacob Gershman", "Joe Palazzolo"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107157/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
