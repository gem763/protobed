But the protests have morphed into demands for an overhaul of the entire political system in the crisis-ravaged country.\n\nAfter on Friday laying out a 72-hour deadline for parties to agree to a framework for economic reforms, Mr Hariri held round-the-clock meetings with Lebanon\u2019s various political blocs to discuss proposals for the 2020 budget.\n\nLate on Sunday Mr Hariri appeared to have bought himself some time with the announcement of a package of reforms including a 50 percent reduction in the salaries of current and former officials.\n\nThe reforms also include $3.3 billion in contributions from banks to reduce the deficit in the heavily indebted country, and plans to overhaul the crippled electricity sector. But they will not be confirmed until approved by the cabinet on Monday, and it is unclear whether they will go far enough.\n\nOn Saturday night, the resignation of four ministers from the Christian Lebanese Forces, a party allied with Mr Hariri, underscored the chaos in government.\n\nBy Sunday evening, with just 24 hours to go before Mr Hariri\u2019s deadline, the country\u2019s streets were awash in flags and furious Lebanese taking aim at all corners.\n\n\u201cNeither Saudi nor Iran will be able to take this protest down,\u201d chanted demonstrators in downtown Beirut Sunday night, referencing the regional arch-rivals that have long jostled for control of the tiny Mediterranean country.\n\nIn the predominantly Shia city of Tyre, in the country\u2019s south, there were chants accusing parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri, himself Shia, of corruption.\n\nThere has also been vocal opposition to Hizbollah and its leader Hassan Nasrallah.\n\n\u201cAll of them means all of them. Nasrallah is one of them,\u201d was heard throughout the protests.\n\nWhile demonstrators called for the government\u2019s departure, its actual collapse would likely herald even greater instability and economic disaster \u2013 something MPs seem anxious to avoid.\n\nMr Hariri has hinted at resignation if his demands are not met. But there are few obvious alternatives to the current PM.\n\nNot only is the post limited to Sunnis by the country\u2019s power-sharing system, but it is also unclear who would be willing to take over in such a disastrous economic situation.\n\nMr Hariri formed the current government of national unity in February after nine months of wrangling. He is currently in his third term as leader.", "description": "Lebanon was shaken on Sunday by its largest protests in years as young and old turned out en masse to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri and his coalition government.
