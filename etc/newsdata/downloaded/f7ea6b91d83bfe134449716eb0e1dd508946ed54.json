We\u2019re tired of them screwing around with us. Politicians only do what they want to do, and turn their backs on all reality,\u201d said Javiera Alarcon, a 29-year-old sociologist protesting outside the presidential palace in Santiago, which was surrounded by police and military vehicles.\n\nAFP video showed security forces blasting a crowd with water cannon, and riot police wrestling young protesters into vans.\n\n\u201cHaving analyzed the situation and the appalling actions that occurred today, I have made the decision to suspend freedoms and movement through a total curfew,\u201d Army General Javier Iturriaga, who is overseeing security during the state of emergency, said on Saturday.\n\nDozens of protesters torched a building belonging to Chile\u2019s oldest newspaper, El Mercurio, in Valparaiso on Saturday evening, while elsewhere in the port city a metro station, supermarkets and other stores were set on fire.\n\n\u2013 Caught flat-footed \u2013\n\nSantiago\u2019s entire metro system \u2014 South America\u2019s largest and most modern and used by around three million people a day \u2014 was shut down Friday as protesters burned and vandalized stations.\n\nAt least 78 stations were damaged, some of which were totally destroyed and could take months to get them operational again.\n\nThe hike in fares that set off the violence would have raised the price of peak hour travel from 800 to 830 pesos ($1.13 to $1.15). The government said the hike, which follwed a 20-peso increase in January, was driven by rising oil prices and a weakening peso.\n\nInitially, students and others responded by fare-dodging, but underlying social tensions quickly bubbled to the surface.\n\nOn Friday, the headquarters of the ENEL Chile power company and a Banco Chile branch \u2014 both in the center of Santiago \u2014 were set on fire and heavily damaged.\n\nPeople were infuriated by a photo of Pinera eating pizza in a restaurant with his family while the city burned.\n\nChile has the highest per capita income of Latin America at $20,000, with expected economic growth this year of 2.5 percent and just two percent inflation.\n\nBut there is an undercurrent of frustration with an economic model that has virtually privatized all health care and education, at a time that falling pensions and rising costs of basic services has exacerbated existing social inequality.", "description": "Santiago (AFP) \u2013 Chile was at a standstill on Sunday following two days of violent protests sparked by anger over economic conditions and social", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/3ceaac_two-days-violent-unrest-in-santiago-metros-buses-burned-clashes-riot-police-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
