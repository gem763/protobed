Biden has deflected questions about alleged self-dealing when he was in the White House and his son served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. He fired back with claims that Mr. Trump was the one who abused Oval Office power by asking Kyiv to open a corruption investigation.\n\n\u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings. Here\u2019s what I know: Trump should be investigated,\u201d Mr. Biden snapped at reporters Saturday on the campaign trail in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nBut Hunter Biden\u2019s plum job in Ukraine raised eyebrows in Washington and around the world as soon as he landed it in 2014 during the height of tensions over the Russian annexation of Crimea after seizing the territory from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe appointment of the vice president\u2019s son to a Ukrainian oil board looks nepotistic at best, nefarious at worst,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Adam Taylor wrote at the time.\n\nHunter Biden, 49, is a Yale-educated lawyer. His drug use and romantic romps have been fodder for the tabloids for years. In July, he explained to The New Yorker magazine that he began dating Hallie Biden, the widow of his deceased brother Beau, after going on a crack cocaine binge.\n\nThe cozy arrangement for Hunter Biden in Ukraine underscores the former vice president\u2019s standing as a creature of the political establishment whose family benefited from inside-the-Beltway perks.\n\nThe narrative plays directly into the hands of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whose crusade against Washington corruption has helped make her the leading alternative to Mr. Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cToo many politicians in both parties have convinced themselves that playing the money-for-influence game is the only way to get things done,\u201d Ms. Warren said recently at a massive campaign rally in New York. \u201cNo more business as usual. Let\u2019s attack the corruption head-on.\u201d\n\nIf the nomination race becomes a contest between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, which appears increasingly likely, then Mr. Biden will have to answer more questions about his son and Ukraine.\n\nThe appearance of impropriety worsened in 2016 when the then-vice president visited Kyiv and threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless the country\u2019s leaders fired Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor for purported corruption.\n\nThe prosecutor also happened to be investigating Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden sat on the board and ran the company\u2019s legal unit.\n\nMr. Trump and his private attorney, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, acknowledged that they had been asking Kyiv to look into possible corruption involving the Bidens. They insist it is a legitimate request.\n\n\u201cVice President Biden did a terrible thing the way he put it,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to hurt him with respect to his son. \u2026 Joe\u2019s got a lot of problems. Joe\u2019s got enough problems. But what he said was a terrible thing.\u201d\n\nHe described Mr. Biden\u2019s action three years ago in Kyiv as a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cIt was an offer. It was beyond an offer,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt was something where he said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor, and they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour.\u2019\u201d\n\nIronically, Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden are accusing each other of the same thing: using White House power against Ukraine for personal gain.\n\nLast week, most news organizations were focused on accusations from a U.S. intelligence community whistleblower who accused Mr. Trump of misconduct for pressuring Kyiv privately to investigate the Biden family\u2019s dealings in Ukraine.\n\nReporters might not be able to keep ignoring the Biden-Ukraine corruption angle.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, called Sunday for a Justice Department investigation of the Biden-Ukraine connection.\n\nThe investigation should be as far-reaching and aggressive as the Russia probe that targeted Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, Mr. Graham said.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden said everybody\u2019s looked at this and found nothing. Who is everybody? Nobody has looked at the Ukraine and the Bidens,\u201d Mr. Graham said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is enough smoke here,\u201d he said. \u201cWas there a relationship between the vice president\u2019s family and the Ukraine business world that was inappropriate? I don\u2019t know. Somebody other than me needs to look at it, and I don\u2019t trust the media to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nHe demanded that the investigation extend to Ukraine\u2019s possible involvement in the 2016 election, including leaking information that discredited Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and contributed to his conviction for tax and bank fraud as a result of the Russia probe.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine if this was the Trump family doing business like this?\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cI like Joe Biden. I like him a lot. But you can\u2019t have it both ways here.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
