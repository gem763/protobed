REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri/File Photo\n\nJawar\u2019s ability to organise street protests helped propel Abiy to power last year, ushering in sweeping political and economic reforms. Abiy won the Nobel peace prize this month for his regional peacemaking achievements.\n\nBut this week, Jawar\u2019s supporters demonstrated against Abiy after Jawar said police had surrounded his home and tried to withdraw his government security detail. Protests in the capital and other cities resulted in 16 deaths and dozens of wounded.\n\nThe violence underscored the dilemma facing Abiy, who must retain support in Ethiopia\u2019s ethnically based, federal system but not be seen to favour one group.\n\nBut kingmakers like media mogul Jawar are flexing their muscles. Like Abiy, Jawar comes from the Oromo ethnic group, Ethiopia\u2019s largest. His supporters have stopped believing in Abiy\u2019s promises of reform, he said, accusing Abiy of centralizing power, silencing dissent, and jailing political prisoners - like his predecessors.\n\nAmnesty International says that, since Abiy took office, there have been several waves of mass arrests of people in Oromiya perceived to be opposed to the government. Detainees were not charged or taken to court, Amnesty\u2019s Ethiopia researcher Fisseha Tekle said.\n\n\u201cThe majority of people believe the transition is off track and we are backsliding towards an authoritarian system,\u201d Jawar said, sitting in his heavily guarded home-office in the centre of the capital, Addis Ababa.\n\n\u201cThe ruling party and its ideology will be challenged seriously not only in the election but also prior to the elections.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman did not return calls seeking comment. Abiy has not commented on this week\u2019s violence.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, the defence ministry said the army had been deployed to seven cities where there had been protests this week. The forces have been deployed \u201cto calm the situation in collaboration with elders and regional security officers,\u201d Major General Mohammed Tessema told a press conference in Addis Ababa.\n\nSTRIDENT PARTIES\n\nThe four ethnically based parties in the coalition that has ruled Ethiopia since 1991 are facing increasing competition from new, more strident parties demanding greater power and resources for their own regions.\n\n\u201cFor a prime minister whose popular legitimacy relies on his openness, recent protests in Oromiya could be politically suicidal,\u201d said Mehari Taddele Maru, an Addis Ababa-based political analyst. \u201cIt signals a significant loss of a populist power base that propelled him to power.\u201d\n\nIf next year\u2019s elections are fair - as Abiy has promised they will be - they will test whether the young prime minister can hold together his fractious nation of 100 million people and continue to open up its state-owned economy, or whether decades of state repression have driven Ethiopians into the arms of the political competition.\n\nJawar said he hadn\u2019t decided who else he would support in next year\u2019s polls, or whether he would run himself. His Twitter feed has been teasing the possibility last weekend: \u201cThe story about me running for office is just speculation. I am running to lose weight.\u201d\n\nHe refused to be drawn on Friday, telling Reuters: \u201cI don\u2019t exclude anything.\u201d\n\nHis remarks were his strongest criticism yet of Abiy, with whom he was photographed frequently last year, but the split follows pointed remarks by Abiy to parliament on Tuesday.\n\nAbiy said, without naming anyone, \u201cMedia owners who don\u2019t have Ethiopian passports are playing both ways ... If this is going to undermine the peace and existence of Ethiopia ... we will take measures.\u201d\n\nThe comments were widely seen as a dig at Jawar, who is Ethiopian-born but has a U.S. passport and returned from exile last year.\n\nAbiy didn\u2019t create Ethiopia\u2019s ethnic divisions, but he must address them, said Abel Wabella, a former political prisoner who is now editor of the Amharic-language newspaper Addis Zeybe.\n\nJawar is \u201ctesting the waters,\u201d he said. \u201cEthnic federalism creates monsters ... if Abiy fails to dismantle the power groups based on ethnicity, and to address the structural problems we have as a nation, we will end up in civil war.\u201d", "description": "Prominent activist Jawar Mohammed does not rule out challenging his erstwhile ally, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, in next year's election, he told Reuters on Friday, after days of demonstrations by his supporters resulted in 16 deaths.", "authors": ["Giulia Paravicini", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444854641&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0ZA-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
