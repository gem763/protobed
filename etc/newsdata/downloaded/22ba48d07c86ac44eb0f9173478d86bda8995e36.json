(See the clip below.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the banana that I wanted!\u201d Bieber whined in his kitchen, mimicking Swift\u2019s reaction. As his wife Hailey continued to film, the Biebs continued: \u201cIt\u2019s not the right banana. It has no head!\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcf9 | Justin Bieber mocks Taylor\u2019s Jimmy Fallon interview clip of Taylor after Lasik Surgery via Instagram Live pic.twitter.com/oPPAsMvQk1 \u2014 Taylor Swift Updates (Backup) (@TSUpdatesNYBU2) October 7, 2019\n\nPerhaps still buoyed by his recent second wedding to Hailey, the Biebs seemed positively giddy in his sendup.\n\nSwift was visiting \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d Thursday when host Jimmy Fallon playfully ambushed her with video showing her groggy and cranky after LASIK surgery. She hilariously lost it while fussing over bananas as she talked to her mother.\n\nWhile the Biebs\u2019 impersonation seemed playful (and his wife commented that Swift\u2019s moment was \u201cfunny\u201d), some outlets suggested that the reenactment packed some shade as well, because of reported tensions between the two.\n\nRecently, Bieber defended his manager, Scooter Braun, after he purchased the rights to Swift\u2019s master recordings. Braun\u2019s acquisition prompted anger from Swift. She also accused Braun of bullying her in the past. Bieber wrote on Instagram that Braun always had her back, and that they both loved her.\n\nKevin Mazur/TCA 2011 via Getty Images Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift in 2011.", "description": "The \"Baby\" singer and wife Hailey teamed up for the joke on Instagram Live.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b294b200000f2004eb866.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
