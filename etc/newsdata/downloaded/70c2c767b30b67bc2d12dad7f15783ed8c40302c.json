Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Stunned, Mitchell said he scribbled questions marks on a notepad to silently ask an aide: \u201cHow do I even respond to this on TV?\u201d\n\nBut one of the final straws was the unwillingness of people in Trump\u2019s orbit to listen. Mitchell implored Vice President Pence, his chief of staff Marc Short and \u201cany human being that has any influence in the White House\u201d to arrange a one-on-one conversation between him and the president so he could express his concerns\u2026\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for a purpose \u2014 and it\u2019s not this petty, childish b\u2014\u2014t,\u201d Mitchell, 62, said in an interview in early September. Pence\u2019s office declined to comment\u2026\n\nMitchell, who hails from a Republican-leaning district that Trump won easily in 2016, simply decided he had enough. He has a 9-year-old son with a learning disability and remaining in a highly polarized Washington just wasn\u2019t worth the trade-off, he said.\n\n\u201cDid any member of this conference expect that their job would start out every morning trying to go through the list of what\u2019s happening in tweets of the day?\u201d Mitchell asked, referring to Trump\u2019s Twitter habits. \u201cWe\u2019re not moving forward right now. We are simply thrashing around.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Trumps-Takeover-Of-Gop-Forces-Many-House-Republicans-To-Head-For-The-Exits"], "top_image": ""}
