They want to make a deal, but do I? I will meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House,\u201d said Trump.\n\n\u201cGold prices have been hit hard after the breaking news that Trump is going to meet [the] Chinese vice premier,\u201d said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets. \u201cBasically, this has increased the odds of a better deal taking place and this is exactly what investors have hoped.\u201d The news buoyed benchmark U.S. stock indexes and dulled demand for haven gold.\n\n\u201cTrump meeting the Chinese vice premier isn\u2019t a small deal at all,\u201d said Aslam.\n\nDecember gold on Comex GCZ19, -0.98% was off $14, or 0.9%, to $1,498.80 an ounce, after rising 0.6% on Wednesday. Futures for gold have settled lower in three of the past four sessions, however. The December contract has traded in a range between $1,543 and $1,465 for the last four weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, December silver SIZ19, -1.52% lost 29 cents, or 1.7%, to reach $17.515 an ounce, following a gain of 0.6% a day ago.\n\nMarkets have been bouncing around as U.S.-China trade negotiations get under way in earnest on Thursday. A number of conflicting reports over the likelihood of a deal had knocked stocks and gold prices around.\n\nSome reports suggested lower-level talks earlier this week had made no headway on critical issues, and that the Chinese delegation\u2019s visit was cut short. However, Bloomberg News reported that the White House could put in place a currency pact and suspend tariff increases that are set to take effect Oct. 15.\n\nStill commodity experts believe the uncertainty may provide support for bullion prices.\n\n\u201cChinese and U.S. politicians cannot agree on terms of mutual trade. Periods of high market volatility increase the demand for gold as a protective asset. However, it would be too simplistic to believe that gold will grow until the parties finally agree,\u201d said Alex Kuptsikevich, financial analyst at FxPro, in a Thursday research note.\n\nOn the data front, the consumer-price index was unchanged in September, the government said Thursday, marking the smallest change since January. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 0.1% advance. And jobless claims for the week held near a 50-year low, with initial jobless claims, a rough way to measure layoffs, declining by 10,000 to 210,000 in the seven days ended Oct. 5, the government said Thursday.\n\nIn other metals trading, December copper HGZ19, +1.75% added 1.5% to $2.6055 a pound and January platinum PLF20, -0.08% shed 0.4% to $893.30 an ounce. December PAZ19, +1.03% traded at $1,666.50 an ounce, up 0.7%, and poised to notch another record settlement.", "description": "Gold futures traded lower Thursday, slipping back under the $1,500 an ounce mark, after President Donald Trump said he plans to meet with Chinese Vice...", "authors": ["Myra P.
