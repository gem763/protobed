Already, QAnon supporters are showing up at Trump rallies.\n\nLee Stranahan, a former Breitbart reporter who now hosts a radio show at Russian-owned Sputnik, said he has struggled to convince QAnon believers that their theory is fake.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just dumb, it\u2019s the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Stranahan told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedentedly dumb in the history of American politics.\u201d\n\nSo far, though, it\u2019s not clear that the pushback from the various pro-Trump personalities will dissuade anyone. Their tweets attacking QAnon are often besieged with replies from fans who believe in QAnon and are now shocked to see that their political heroes don\u2019t.\n\nFurther complicating the effort, the pro-Trump figures now trying to fight QAnon have often embraced equally outlandish conspiracy theories themselves. And everyone involved supports Trump, who built his political career pushing the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was actually born in Kenya.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s not just dumb, it\u2019s the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s unprecedentedly dumb in the history of American politics. \u201d \u2014 Lee Stranahan\n\nThe QAnon pushback kicked off in earnest over the weekend, with various prominent Trump supporters attacking the conspiracy theory. Jacob Wohl, a young Trump supporter who has built a following on Twitter, declared that QAnon was \u201ccomplete and utter nonsense.\u201d Conservative columnist Kurt Schlichter called the theory \u201cvaguely entertaining nonsense.\u201d In a Reddit post, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer shot down a question about whether QAnon was \u201clegit\u201d with a one-word reply: \u201cno.\u201d\n\nScott Adams, the Dilbert creator who positioned himself as a pro-Trump thought leader, said in a video Sunday that QAnon believers were making all Trump supporters look \u201clike a bunch of idiots.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe do it a little quieter, because it\u2019s not helping the brand,\u201d Adams said.\n\nQAnon supporters often posit that former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe, is somehow involved in Q. But on Monday, Flynn\u2019s son joined in the chorus of pro-Trump figures slamming QAnon.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019ve been mentioned alongside the #QAnon hashtag before, I\u2019ve never taken it seriously,\u201d Michael Flynn Jr. tweeted. \u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t either.\u201d\n\nFlynn was soon deluged with angry QAnon fans. \u201cI will hold my tongue, out of respect for your father,\u201d wrote one Twitter user.\n\nThe internal GOP pushback even included an attempt to debunk Q. Jack Posobiec, a reporter for the conservative One American News Network, claimed without much evidence that he had found the originator of QAnon and was working on a piece \u201cdebunking\u201d the whole conspiracy theory. Like Flynn, Posobiec was soon awash in hundreds of disappointed QAnon believers accusing him of being part of a deep-state plot.\n\nThe QAnon pushback from the right appears to have been sparked less by concern about the conspiracy theory itself and more by mainstream media stories that exposed the bizarre beliefs of QAnon believers.\n\nPosobiec, for example, has previously been more sympathetic to QAnon fans, tweeting the group\u2019s slogan, \u201cWhere we go one, we go all,\u201d and referencing \u201cthe original Q.\u201d Posobiec has since deleted those tweets.\n\nBut many of the pro-Trump figures now attacking QAnon have pushed conspiracy theories themselves. Both Flynn and Posobiec promoted Pizzagate, the conspiracy theory about a pedophile ring in a Washington, D.C. pizzeria that climaxed with an armed man storming the restaurant. Now that Pizzagate, like many other conspiracy theories, has been folded into QAnon, they\u2019re struggling to stop it.\n\nStranahan, who has sparred with QAnon believers over Twitter for months, said QAnon is the latest example of Trump supporters falling for a Pizzagate-style conspiracy theory.\n\n\u201cI view this as the next rung on the ladder to hell,\u201d Stranahan said.", "description": "Fearing the left will turn the conspiracy theory against them, the president\u2019s cheerleaders try to talk sense into the grassroots.
