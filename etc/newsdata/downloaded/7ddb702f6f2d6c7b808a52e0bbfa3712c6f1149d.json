The other signs include words such as \u201cracist,\u201d \u201csexist,\u201d \u201chomophobic,\u201d and \u201cbigot.\u201d\n\nA reporter for the University of Wisconsin, Madison, student newspaper identified the student as senior Jasmine Kiah. That report claims that Kiah played the song \u201cF*ck Donald Trump\u201d by YG and Nipsey Hussle as she procedural taped the signs to the office\u2019s windows.\n\n\u201cEvery day I come past and I see this office, it makes me very upset, while we have\u2026children at the border who are taken away from their parents, their parents are taken away from them and who is it because? It is because of Donald Trump,\u201d Kiah told the student reporter.\n\nKiah claimed that she was motivated to vandalize the offices by her own experiences with racism and bigotry on campus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here for four years and all four years I\u2019ve experienced racism, I\u2019ve seen homophobia, transphobia, I\u2019ve seen people not treated fairly, class institutional racism all of that stuff,\u201d Kiah added. \u201cEverything that you could imagine, I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nMeredith McGlone, University of Wisconsin Director of News and Media Relations, told the student reporter in a statement that the university does not approve the posting of unapproved signs. However, they defend the rights of students to engage in civil discourse.\n\n\u201cUW-Madison supports the free speech rights of its students along with civil discourse around political issues,\u201d McGlone said. \u201cThe university\u2019s policies prohibit the posting of unapproved signs, posters and other material in public spaces.\u201d\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.", "description": "A student from the University of Wisconsin was caught covering the campus College Republicans office with signs that read \"Donald Trump is...,\" \"racist,\" \"sexist,\" and \"bigot.\"", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Impeachment-protest-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
