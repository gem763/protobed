But grievances from the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees that have spilled into public from the private negotiations suggest a murky path forward for a bill that has been signed into law for nearly 60 years straight.\n\nThe Hill's Rebecca Kheel explains why this poses risks for a government shutdown.\n\nON TAP TOMORROW\n\nThe Federal Reserve's Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) begins its two-day meeting in Washington, D.C.\n\nA House Financial Services subcommittee holds a hearing on LGBTQ+ discrimination within the housing and lending industries, 10 a.m.\n\nA House Judiciary subcommittee holds a hearing entitled \"Antitrust and Economic Opportunity: Competition in Labor Markets,\" 10 a.m.\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee holds a markup of pending legislation related to the Export-Import Bank, terrorism risk insurance, 1 p.m.\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\nSlumping Halloween sales spook experts: Beyond ghosts and ghouls and the walking dead, Halloween may have some frightening news for the economy.\n\nRetailers say they expect American consumers to shell out $8.8 billion this Halloween on costumes, candy and pumpkins. That figure may sound massive, but it represents the second consecutive fall in annual spending, a worrying sign for a consumer-driven economy -- and for President Trump Donald John Trump'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Kayla Mueller's mother: Daughter might still be alive 'If Obama had been as decisive' as Trump MORE's reelection prospects.\n\nIn a year that's seen tariffs imposed on $360 billion in imports from China and with warning signs of a recession flashing, the bite into holiday spending could be a sign the economy is going the way of the undead.\n\nThe trend for consumer sentiment over the past year has been clear, according to John Leer, an analyst at Morning Consult, which recently launched a daily consumer sentiment index that tracks how consumers feel about the current economy and their expectations of where the economy is headed.\n\n\"For all these consumer indexes, we see that they are considerably lower than they were at this time last year,\" Leer said. The Hill's Niv Elis explains why here.\n\nThe big takeaway: Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 percent of the U.S. economy, so a drop in consumer sentiment can be a bad omen for growth. It could also pose risks for Trump, who is hoping to ride a strong economy to reelection.\n\nGOOD TO KNOW\n\nThe S&P 500, an index that tracks the largest U.S. companies, hit a new peak of 3,043 on Monday, breaking a summer record of 3,027.\n\nThe left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy on Monday released a paper arguing a financial transaction tax (FTT) could reduce wealth and income inequality, as several Democratic presidential candidates have released proposals calling for those types of taxes.\n\nInterest is also growing among 2020 Democrats in raising the corporate tax rate back to the level where it was prior to President Trump's tax-cut law.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) on Monday released a paper providing its preliminary estimates for various ways to finance \"Medicare for All,\" as the issue of how to pay for such a health plan has taken center stage in the Democratic presidential primary.\n\nA survey of U.S. companies by the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) found hiring has fallen sharply in recent months, according to an NABE summary of the survey.\n\nODDS AND ENDS", "description": "Happy Monday and welcome back to On The Money.
