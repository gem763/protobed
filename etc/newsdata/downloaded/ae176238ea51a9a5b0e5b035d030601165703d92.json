In addition, roaming tankers were dispatched to supply residents with water until the situation normalises.\n\n\"Meanwhile, Hammanskraal residents are warned to be on the lookout for unscrupulous people driving around in water tankers, selling water in the area. The City would like to put on record that we are not charging anyone for water that we are providing through the water tankers,\" said Mashigo.\n\nMashigo said no consumer is expected to pay any amount of money to anyone who is contracted to the City to provide water in the area.\n\nHe advised customers to contact the local offices of the metro police, nearest police station, or the City\u2019s regional offices should they be approached or spot a driver of a water tanker selling water.", "description": "The City of Tshwane says it will continue to use tankers to supply the residents of Hammanskraal and surrounding areas with water.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5217/5106de5030364cb791beba4e0028a535.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
