The coupe-like concept is the automaker's first fully electric model. We\u2019re confused about Mazda\u2019s use of the MX acronym for this new model, as those two letters have traditionally been reserved for sports cars such as the MX-5 Miata.\n\nThe car does, however, have half rear suicide doors that are reminiscent of those on the RX-8 sports car, so we suppose that could be viewed as a tie-in with Mazda\u2019s sportier offerings. The rear half-doors make this look much more legitimately like a coupe/SUV than many other that claim that mantle. The swoopy C-pillar has a contrasting color that emphasizes the rakish rear end. Mazda calls the door setup a \u201cfreestyle\u201d door, and the B-pillar-less design appears to make rear-seat access decently simple.\n\nPhoto credit: Mazda More\n\nPhoto credit: Mazda More\n\nMazda is emphasizing the earthy angle for the interior, employing \"natural\" materials including cork.\n\nAt this point, Mazda is mum on any details on the MX-30's powertrain, saying only that it\u2019s a battery EV.\n\nPhoto credit: Mazda More\n\nPre-orders start in Europe, and deliveries will start next year. We expect the MX-30 to come to the U.S. at some point in the near future, but it will likely follow other markets by several months.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Mazda's first EV sports body cladding, suicide doors, and the evocative MX moniker.", "authors": ["Joey Capparella"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JgD79ZLL3twZVq2G07ThTA--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/3c7fbf2164c1351c4d74ff7b06373e6d", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
