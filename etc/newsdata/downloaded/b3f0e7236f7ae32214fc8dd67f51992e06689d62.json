The market is begging for clarity, to be able to invest or not invest.\"\n\nHe said the current level of the pound, which is trading is at its highest level for around five months against the dollar, suggested the currency market believed the Brexit negotiations were now coming to a conclusion.\n\nCurrency analysts said they expected the next strong movement in the pound to be when the Brexit deal is voted on in Parliament.\n\nHowever, after Saturday's vote many believe, a no-deal Brexit is now less likely. US investment bank Goldman Sachs, which issues regular updates to its clients, now rates the probability of a no-deal Brexit as 5%, down from 10% previously,", "description": "Most big banks in London have called in extra staff to react to a potentially volatile trading session.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5ADC/production/_109306232_mediaitem109306229.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
