That\u2019s pretty huge in these days,\u201d Popovich told a group of reporters. \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s kind of Orwellian. You think we\u2019re living in a place where, \u2018Is this really happening?\u2019 But that comparison was pretty stark when you put our president up against those leaders when he\u2019s with them or talking to him and how he reacts compared to the way Adam Silver reacted. I was proud of him. It was great.\u201d\n\nPopovich\u2019s comments come days after a Wednesday press conference when the president took shots at both Popovich, and Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, for their harsh criticisms of him and their weak responses toward China.\n\n\u201cThey talk badly about the United States, but when it talks about China, they don\u2019t want to say anything bad,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI thought it was pretty sad, actually. It\u2019ll be very interesting.\u201d\n\nPopovich continued, \u201cAll I did was make a comparison between Adam Silver\u2019s show of principle and courage in a tough situation, as opposed to how our president reacts when in the company of authoritarian figures, whether it\u2019s Saudi Arabia, North Korea, Russia or Turkey, whatever it is. It comes off as really feckless, impotent, cowardly by comparison.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of feckless, impotent, and cowardly, Popovich did not list China among the nations led by authoritarian figures.\n\nThe NBA is reeling after a pro-democracy tweet from Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, angered the Chinese just before the league was set to play several exhibition games in the communist nation. The NBA further dug itself a hole by not stridently defending the free speech rights of Morey in their initial response, instead, they called the offense caused by Morey\u2019s tweet, \u201cregrettable.\u201d\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich shot back at President Trump's criticisms of NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on Sunday", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Jae-C.-Hong-2-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
