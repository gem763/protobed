Though experts rely on Treasury yields and GDP to read the recessionary tea leaves, some economists are looking at new sources, like Google searches, to provide faster insights into the health of the economy. (Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBy January 2008, it was clear that something was deeply amiss in the global economy. The unemployment rate was creeping upward. The Federal Reserve had slashed interest rates by the largest amount in 25 years. And financial markets around the world were tumbling.\n\nThe growing list raised a natural question: Are we in a recession?\n\nTo find out, many Americans typed a simple query into Google: \u201crecession 2008.\u201d It was a more useful search term than plain-old \u201crecession,\u201d which returned a lot of Econ 101 stuff about definitions and history. \u201cRecession 2008,\u201d by contrast, served up page after page of recent articles about what was happening right now.\n\nAs it turned out, 2008 \u2014 in the heart of the Great Recession \u2014 was a banner year for people searching for current-year recession information, according to Google Trends data. There was no equivalent in prior years, and in the years since \u2014 the longest expansion in U.S. history \u2014 Googled recession anxieties have never matched the heights reached in January 2008.\n\nLast month, however, that all changed.\n\nLast month, the level of current-year recession searches for the first time surpassed the numbers seen during the Great Recession. The spike was probably driven by news of an inverted yield curve, a classic signal that a recession is on the way.\n\nOther recession-related Google searches revealed similar patterns. \u201cRecession signs,\u201d \u201crecession indicators\u201d and \u201crecession investments\u201d all rose to levels not seen since the 2007-2008 recession. Although economists continue to rely heavily on traditional indicators such as Treasury yields, gross domestic product and confidence indexes to read the recessionary tea leaves, some experts are looking to incorporate newer data sources, such as Google searches, to glean even faster insights into the health of the economy.\n\nSome analysts, for instance, have been using search terms such as \u201cunemployment\u201d and \u201ccoupon\u201d to suss out future recession probabilities. Google\u2019s chief economist, Hal Varian, has noted correlations between searches such as \u201csocial security locations\u201d and \u201cunemployment office\u201d and recessionary factors.\n\nThe big challenge in crafting useful real-world predictions out of Google searches is that, methodology-wise, economists are starting from scratch. There\u2019s a ton of uncertainty between the words typed into a search engine and the real-world circumstances that prompted that query.\n\nIf a person simply types in \u201crecession,\u201d for instance, what does it actually mean? Is it a student looking for sources for a term paper? A worker worried about his job prospects? Somebody noodling around on the Internet, following Wikipedia rabbit holes? Someone just verifying how it\u2019s spelled?\n\nOf course, there\u2019s plenty of margin of error around traditional forecasting methods as well. Writing in the New York Times recently, Neil Irwin presented the case against the inevitability of a recession, despite what the economic indicators say. If consumer spending remains strong, if the damage from the Trump administration\u2019s trade war with China is confined, and if the Federal Reserve gets aggressive on interest rate cuts, we may simply be headed for a \u201cperiod of sluggish growth,\u201d rather than a full-on recession, Irwin writes.\n\nLooking at the Google data, it\u2019s worth noting that current-year recession anxieties spiked in August 2011. That month, stock markets tanked on global recession fears, and the White House sought to soothe investor anxieties: \u201cMarkets go up and down,\u201d as then-White House press secretary Jay Carney told the New York Times. As we know now, a recession was ultimately averted and the U.S. economy continued trundling along at a modest pace.\n\nOne final note about the Google data is that as in 2008, in absolute terms, the volume of current-year recession searches remains quite low. Even during the height of the Great Recession, for instance, searches for \u201crecession\u201d did not manage to surpass the numbers for Kim Kardashian \u2014 a common benchmark used to gauge the absolute volume of a search term.\n\nBut the terms were close in overall volume then, and they are close in volume now. And if recession searches happen to surpass searches for Kim K. in the coming months \u2014 what an economist might call an inverted Kardashian curve \u2014 it might be time to buckle up.", "description": "People type their recession anxieties into Google, and they're currently at a fever pitch.", "authors": ["Christopher Ingraham", "Reporter Covering All Things Data", "September At Am", "Christopher Ingraham Writes About All Things Data.
