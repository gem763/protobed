Her lifeboat was one of the first to be lowered into the Atlantic.\n\nShe was seen by several people to wave her cane in the air both on the ship and in the lifeboat where she became a self-appointed signal woman.\n\nShe later said: 'We turned and went back, and lingered around for a long time, trying to locate the other boats, but we could not locate them except by hearing them.\n\n'The only way they could locate us was by my electric lamp.\n\n'The lamp on the boat was absolutely worth nothing. They tinkered with it all along, but they could not get it in shape. I had an electric cane - a cane with an electric light in it - and that was the only light we had.\n\n'We sat there for a long time, and we saw the ship go down.'\n\nBut Mr Lightoller, who was the most senior Titanic crew member to survive, said Mrs White's efforts were not appreciated.\n\nHe later wrote: 'One very good lady who achieved fame by waving an electric light and successfully blinding us as we worked on the boats.\n\n'It puzzled me until I found she had it installed in the head of her walking stick.\n\n'I am afraid she was rather disappointed on finding out that her precious light was not a bit appreciated.\n\n'Arriving in safety on board the Carpathia, she tried to make out that someone had stolen her wretched stick, whereas it had been merely taken from her, in response to my request that someone would throw the damn thing overboard.'\n\nThe black enamelled walking stick has a rubber base on one end and the amber coloured bakelite crown containing a clear bulb at the other.\n\nThe stick is being sold on Saturday.", "description": "First class passenger Ella White carried the walking cane, pictured, onto the deck of RMS Titanic as crew mustered the wealthy women and children towards the lifeboats on April 14, 1912.", "authors": ["Darren Boyle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/15/19742918-0-image-a-86_1571148769781.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
