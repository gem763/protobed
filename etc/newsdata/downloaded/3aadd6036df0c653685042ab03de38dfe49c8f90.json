Sitting there with razor blades in his mouth and not one of them even knows.'\n\nDan Read, 27, appeared on Channel 4's Crime and Punishment, and struggled with his deteriorating mental health after spending months in a segregation unit. He was seen carrying razor blades in his mouth which he later used to slash his throat\n\nViewers were stunned by the prison's treatment of Dan, with some suggesting he was like an 'angry dog' who had been 'caged for years'\n\nAnother added: 'That's like caging an angry dog for years, then expecting him to play nicely in the local park off his lead. Was never happening. 50 miles from anyone he knows too, no chance.'\n\nSegregation units often comprise of a number of small dark cells and long stays have been deemed detrimental to a prisoner's mental health. For some, the continued use in modern jails is controversial.\n\nColin Martin argued that they are vital in order to retain control of the prison, saying: 'They've taken [prisoners] out of society because they can't conform and they put them in here, and then they can't conform in here.\n\n'You wanna be in a rehabilitative culture. A lot of these guys have a complex life - chaotic lives - but we can't work with them and give them hope for the future unless we have control. So we have to put them in segregation units on their own.\n\nColin Martin, Head of Security and Intelligence, said the use of segregation units was vital in keeping control of the prison\n\nMeanwhile prison officer Tom Baynard, 24, said he could understand how people thought it was a 'crude' and 'archaic' form of punishment.\n\nHe went on: 'I don't think there's a single prison that could work without a seg, for their safety, other prisoners, or other members of staff.\n\n'There are times when there is nowhere other than a seg for a prisoner to be held.'\n\nOne of the criminals held in the segregation unit at HMP Winchester was Dan Read, 27, who was serving a 12 year sentence for GBH with intent to cause serious harm, and was put in the seg for putting an officer in a headlock and dragging him into his cell.\n\nDan was put in the segregation unit after putting an officer in a headlock and dragging him into his cell\n\nDeputy governor Susie Richardson admitted that isolating humans in segregation units for a long time was 'not good for anyone'\n\nDeputy governor Susie Richardson said the segregation unit was there to 'pick up the pieces', but admitted: 'Isolating a human being for a long time is not good for anyone - it's not how humans are meant to live.\n\n'The intention is to work with that man and get him back into the prison.'\n\nPrison guidelines say that prisoners should be kept inside the seg for as little time as possible, and Dan was quickly moved from the seg into the A wing.\n\nBut it was not long before he was back in the seg after allegedly threatening to assault a female officer.\n\nWhile speaking to Channel 4's camera crew, Dan revealed he was keeping razor blades in his mouth and called them 'a game of chess'\n\nIn protest, he smashed a cell observation panel and, while talking to the documentary crew, he revealed he was keeping three razor blades in his mouth.\n\nHe told them: 'They are my game of chess, they are my king, my queen, my rook. that's what they are.'\n\nStaff grew increasingly concerned about his behaviour after weeks in segregation, and were horrified when Dan slashed at his neck with one of the blades.\n\nOfficer Baynard phoned for help, saying: 'He's now taking one of the blades in his mouth and slit his neck with it.\n\nAt one stage, the prisoner said he'd be leaving the prison in a body bag, and slit his throat while in the seg unit\n\nHe added: 'He's not pouring with blood but with him in there like that, I'm not opening that door.'\n\nAnd while communicating with Tom through the day, Dan told the officer: 'I'm going [out of here] in a body bag mate.\n\n'I'm trying to progress, you want me to progress, and rehabilitated? I'm just sat here going f******* mad.'\n\nHaving recovered from his injury, he was placed back in segregation, and continued to have help from staff in the prison, including counselling, and daily visits from the chaplain.\n\nDan went on to say he was terrified of being released from prison, having spent over 100 days of his sentence in the segregation unit\n\nHe said he was terrified of leaving prison, saying: 'What would you be like if you've spent a long time in jail, first time in jail? I'm scared.'\n\nWith a release date approaching, a nervous Dan faced a probation service meeting, where his risk of violence in the community was evaluated.\n\nAnd he was devastated to learn that due to his violent behaviour in prison, he wouldn't be permitted to live with his family.\n\nInstead, he would have to stay in an approved facility 50 miles from home instead.\n\nOfficer Baynard admitted he felt sympathetic towards Dan and said he felt he was 'scared of freedom'\n\nHe said: 'How am I going to stay in a community and travel 50 miles whenever I need to go for probation?\n\n'I'm far away from home, I've got no family round me to support me, I've got f*** all. I'm going to end up going downhill.'\n\nOfficer Baynard said he felt sympathetic towards Dan, saying: 'I can only imagine the stuff that will be difficult on release will be the amount of stuff that has changed since he's been out.\n\n'He's 28. So I don't think he's had a chance to mature as well as a lot of people have.'\n\nThe prison officer went on to say he thought Dan would find release from prison 'difficult' as he was 'scared of messing up'\n\nHe went on: 'I personally think he is scared about the amount of freedom he is going to have, and he's scared of messing it up.\n\n'I know he wants to rebuild relationship with his family. He's just scared about going out and then doing something and then having it taken away again.'\n\nAnd when the day of Dan's release came around, he admitted he was terrified.\n\nHe said: 'I'm more apprehensive than excited. [All the] help from the staff down here, I wouldn't have made it through without them.'\n\nHaving been deemed 'unsuitable' to return to the general prison population, Dan was released straight from the segregation unit\n\nDan spent 116 days of the final part of his sentence in segregation and, deemed unsuitable to return to the general prison population, he was released straight from the seg.\n\nAnd as he was being signed out of prison he admitted: 'Nah I want to go back down the block.'\n\nHe was released on 14 December 2018, with the documentary makers revealing just two months later he had been arrested again following a drunken argument with staff at his hostel.\n\nHe was returned to prison for poor behavior and unless parole board grant his release, he will remain inside until 2024.\n\nViewers were shocked by the porgramme, with many suggesting that Dan had been set up to fail by the system\n\nViewers were devastated by the revelation that he was back in prison, and pointed to the system as 'setting him up to fail'.\n\nOne commented: 'My heart is broken over Dan. OK he had a lot of behavioural issues but you can\u2019t just let people out after spending their formative years in prison with no aftercare plan, place them 50 miles away from family and not expect them to breach license conditions.'\n\nAnother wrote: 'Why do authorities wonder why there's a revolving door in the prison system when they house vulnerable prisoners with mental health issues 50 miles away from any support network when they're released?'\n\nOne added: 'Dan was completely set up to fail. 50 miles away from his family that's a stitch up. Needed a family round him more than ever, and wasn't given it.'", "description": "Viewers were shocked by Crime and Punishment last night, as prisoner Dan Read, 27, was filmed carrying razor blades in his mouth while imprisoned in a segregation unit at HMP Winchester.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/08/20025098-0-image-a-30_1571730051309.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
