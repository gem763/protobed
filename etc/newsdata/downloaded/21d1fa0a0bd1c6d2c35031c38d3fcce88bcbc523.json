DoorDash now does grocery delivery for WalmartInc., and in August it signed an agreement with e-commerce platform Mercato Inc. to make same-day deliveries from about 750 independent grocers.\n\nGrocery delivery can build sales for a company, but it is expensive to run and profits so far have been scarce. KrogerCo. , the largest U.S. supermarket chain, has reported lower profits this year, in part because of investments in its online business. Kroger is working to develop its own network of warehouses using digital technology and robots that could fulfill customers\u2019 online orders.\n\nDelivering groceries costs supermarkets an average of $10 an order, but grocers recoup only around $8 from customers, because charging more risks turning shoppers off, according to a survey of supermarket executives by consulting firm Capgemini .\n\nRestaurant-delivery companies also have struggled to turn profits, as they spend to gain market share while keeping costs down for consumers.\n\nUber has pointed to its Eats division as an area with high-growth potential. Gross bookings, or the total amount users spent on meal orders, reached $7.9 billion for Eats last year, up from $3 billion the year earlier, it said in a securities filing. Adjusted net revenue per order last year was 10%, down from 12% in 2017. The company attributed the decrease to increased driver incentives, new market expansion and lower service fees from big restaurant partnerships.\n\nUber landed a major food-delivery deal last year by striking a partnership with McDonald\u2019sCorp. , then had to negotiate to a lower amount earned from each delivery, as franchisees pushed back at the costs. McDonald\u2019s has since expanded its delivery partners, adding DoorDash and GrubhubInc., in efforts to reach more diners.\n\nUber is testing grocery delivery in Australia and is in talks with some European and North American chains, executives have said. The company just rolled out a new version of its app that gives more prominence to its Eats division.\n\nWith Cornershop, Uber said it plans to bring grocery delivery to its millions of consumers around the world. Cornershop already provides on-demand delivery for supermarkets, pharmacies and food retailers in Chile, Mexico, Peru and Toronto, Canada\u2019s largest city.\n\nBeyond ride-hailing and food delivery services, Uber last week launched the Uber Works app, aiming to pair businesses with temporary workers. It also offers services such as freight brokerage, and it recently launched a helicopter service in New York to take travelers from Manhattan to John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\n\u201cWe want Uber to be the operating system for your everyday life,\u201d Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said.\n\nLast year, Walmart also had its eye on Cornershop, which is based in Santiago, Chile. The retail juggernaut agreed to buy the company for roughly $225 million, but those plans fell through after Mexican antitrust officials blocked the deal in June. The regulator said the acquisition could allow Cornershop to refuse service to Walmart competitors or that Walmart could refuse to sell its products on platforms operated by Cornershop\u2019s competitors.\n\nCornershop, which is backed by Accel, ALLVP, Creandum, and Jackson Square Ventures, was founded in 2015 by Oskar Hjertonsson, Daniel Undurraga and Juan Pablo Cuevas.\n\nAfter the deal closes, Cornershop will remain under its current leadership and will report to a board that has majority Uber representation, Uber said.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in early 2020.", "description": "The deal comes as Uber Eats and rivals rush to sign with big food sellers like Walmart and McDonald\u2019s", "authors": ["Dow Jones Newswires"], "top_image": "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HA919_barron_NS_20181226134502.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
