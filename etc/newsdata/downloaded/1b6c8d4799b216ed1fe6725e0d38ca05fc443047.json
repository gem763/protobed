Since then, the company has flown rockets to orbit over and over again, then landed the accompanying boosters upright on the ground and reused them, an industry first for orbital missions. The company has launched commercial satellites, government spy missions, and cargo to the International Space Station. It shot a Tesla toward Mars and sprinkled internet satellites around Earth.\n\nRead: Elon Musk\u2019s emotional response to a space milestone\n\nMusk founded SpaceX to someday send people to Mars, and he has said for years that he will make space travel as easy as hopping on a plane. As he stood in front of a gleaming steel spaceship, it was tempting to start believing him. \u201cIt\u2019s really gonna be pretty epic to see that thing take off and come back,\u201d Musk said.\n\nStarship halves being joined pic.twitter.com/7pdxfh8e81 \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 27, 2019\n\nBut that is the hypnotic nature of such showcases. The flashiness of the affair, the giddy confidence of the host\u2014these can almost elide the unspoken hitch here, that building interplanetary spaceship is far more difficult than hardwiring a smartphone.\n\nThe specifics of the spaceship project have fluctuated over the years, with Musk introducing and then scrapping several designs and names. The latest, and it seems final, iteration is a stainless steel behemoth bookended by sharp fins. Musk envisions a rather unprecedented landing process; the vessel would return to Earth like a skydiver falling belly-first before righting itself and landing upright, as Falcon 9 rockets do.\n\nLast month, another Starship prototype, with a single engine rather than the anticipated dozens, levitated about 500 feet into the sky and then glided down. The next test will aim higher. Musk said this prototype, which measures 164 feet high and 30 feet in diameter, would fly to 65,000 feet within one to two months.\n\n\u201cThis is gonna sound totally nuts, but I think we want to try to reach orbit in less than six months,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI think we could potentially see people flying next year, if we get to orbit in about six months.\u201d The passengers could depart from Boca Chica or Cape Canaveral, the vaunted site of the Apollo and Space Shuttle launches, where SpaceX operates a pair of launchpads.\n\nDon\u2019t mark your calendars just yet. Musk is known for his optimistic deadlines, and SpaceX projects, as is true of virtually all space-exploration efforts, tend to launch several years later than predicted. Musk himself recognized that last night, as he described a future in which Starship flies several days a day. \u201cI\u2019m giving you literally just stream-of-consciousness here,\u201d Musk said.\n\nRead: A new era of spaceflight\n\nThere is also the small matter of the complicated nature of Starship\u2019s payload. Aside from a pair of fiery mishaps a few years ago, SpaceX has shown it can reliably deploy satellites and cargo to space. But it has never launched people.", "description": "The SpaceX founder has laid out an ambitious future for his Starship project, the effort to deliver people to the moon and Mars.", "authors": ["Marina Koren"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX75473/facebook.jpg?1569779916", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
