This is a legitimate ask, since election meddling looks to have come from both Russia and Ukraine.\"\n\nShe pointed out that it was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky who first mentioned Rudy Giuliani and said he was the first to broach the subject of an investigation.\n\nREP. RATCLIFFE ON UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT: DEMS 'HAVE HARMED OUR NATIONAL SECURITY' IN THEIR DESIRE TO DESTROY TRUMP\n\n\"It is actually Zelensky who brings up Rudy Giuliani -- saying they can\u2019t wait to \u201cmeet him.\u201d And it is Zelensky who references \u201cthat investigation,\u201d as he goes on to promise that \u201call investigations will be done openly and candidly,\" she continued.\n\n\"Trump says 'good' and expresses worries that a 'good' prosecutor was 'shut down.' Mentions 'Biden\u2019s son' and that Biden bragged he 'stopped the prosecution.' Ends that bit with 'It sounds horrible to me.'\"\n\nShe also said the Department of Justice and Attorney General Bill Barr have yet to speak with Trump, or any Ukranian officials, directly about the matter and have released a statement to address the issue.\n\n\"And, never mind, because: DOJ in statement says the President has not spoken to AG about investigating Biden and has not asked the AG to contact the Ukraine. Also, Barr has not communicated with Ukraine\u2014\u201con this or any subject,\" Strassel added.\n\nRUDY GIULIANI CLAIMS UKRAINE SCANDAL REVEALED REAL 'COLLUSION,' ACCUSES BIDEN OF 'SELLING THE PRESIDENCY'\n\nShe ended by claiming the whistleblower who leaked the story had political bias and ulterior motivations, before criticizing Democrats for letting their impeachment fixation steer the ship of state.\n\n\"Whistleblower? Look at this nugget, referenced in the OLC opinion. The IG\u2019s review found \"some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,\" Strassel wrote.\n\n\"Media got all this so wrong. And Democrats look all the more partisan and radical to have moved toward impeachment.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFollowing the release of the transcript, Democrats said Trump abused his power by asking Zelensky to look into Joe Biden and his son, while Republicans fell back on the fact that the president never mentioned money or threatened to withhold military aid.", "description": "Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel\u00a0offered her analysis of the\u00a0Trump-Ukraine transcript on Twitter Wednesday, saying it was an \"internal attempt\" to oust the president.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
