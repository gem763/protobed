Photo: JD Images/Shutterstock\n\nDid noted fianc\u00e9s Jennifer Lawrence and Cooke Maroney recently take a quick jaunt down to the New York City Marriage Bureau to grab a marriage license ahead of their low-key wedding ceremony next month? Or did they actually go ahead and become Mr. and Mrs. J.Law?\n\nHere is what we know: According to \u201cPage Six,\u201d Lawrence and her art-world beau were spotted at the Marriage Bureau in Manhattan on Monday, and not just by themselves. They were accompanied by two security guards \u2014 which is to be expected \u2014 but also noted celebrity photographer Mark Seliger and an unidentified friend of the pair. (Or should we be saying \u201cwitness\u201d?)\n\nNow it\u2019s entirely possible that the two, who have been kissing for a little over a year now, were just enthusiastically preparing their paperwork; Lawrence did recently express her admiration for the bureaucracy around the institution of marriage, proclaiming on a podcast, \u201cI want to legally bind [Cooke Maroney] to me forever. And fortunately the paperwork exists for such a thing. It\u2019s the greatest. You find your favorite person in the planet and you\u2019re like, you can\u2019t leave.\u201d Also, as \u201cPage Six\u201d notes, the couple \u2014 who was seen clutching papers \u2014 was \u201cdressed down.\u201d\n\nBut in the very same sentence, the outlet also reports that the pair was \u201cbeaming.\u201d Additionally, in a now-deleted tweet, an onlooker at the bureau reportedly wrote, \u201cWhen you go get your marriage license and Jennifer Lawrence walks by to tie the knot before your eyes. Yeah, kids, City Hall is COOL. The place to go!\u201d (The outlet also claims to be in possession of a photo in which Maroney \u201cseems to be covering his ring finger on his left hand outside the building.\u201d Hmm!)\n\nTo think, we didn\u2019t even know what a \u201cCooke Maroney\u201d was a year and a half ago.\n\nStay in touch.
