Biden, Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in some of the recent public polling on the race.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering into a different phase. You know, there was a lot in the beginning about getting known here, but also nationally. A lot about putting together the resources we need in order to win,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve been able to do a lot of that work in the first half of this year. We\u2019re going to spend the second half of this year putting those resources to work on the ground.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
