Hannah Gaber, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic presidential hopeful John Delaney is pitching his campaign by saying he wants to take a small-dollar donor to the World Series with him.\n\nThe Washington Nationals are playing in the World Series for the first time in franchise history, against the Houston Astros.\n\nDelaney, the first candidate to announce a 2020 presidential run, has only qualified for the June and July debates and has been stagnant in both fundraising and polling. He has self-funded much of his campaign.\n\nHis campaign\u2019s pitch says that if supporters chip in \u201cANY amount,\u201d they will be \u201cautomatically entered to win two club-level seats to the World Series on Saturday 10/26\u201d and that they will cover travel expenses \u201cto get you and a guest to the game!\u201d\n\n.@JohnDelaney is giving away World Series tickets to a donor!

For Saturday's Game 4, tickets on that level are well over $1,000 apiece, according to the Nationals website.\n\nExcited to watch the Nats play tonight! I\u2019m even more excited because this year, I\u2019m inviting a lucky winner (and their guest) to come watch the World Series with me! \u2014 John Delaney (@JohnDelaney) October 22, 2019\n\nMontana Gov. and fellow 2020 contender Steve Bullock poked fun at Delaney, releasing a statement that he was \u201cextending an open invitation to supporters and members of the press alike to join him in Helena this Friday\u201d for a local high school football game, clarifying that \u201cExpenses will not be covered by the Bullock for President Campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt ain't the World Series, but if you come to the cross town game in Helena this weekend I'll buy you a Coke. #GoBengals,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nIt ain't the World Series, but if you come to the cross town game in Helena this weekend I'll buy you a Coke. #GoBengalshttps://t.co/L40clU9n6s \u2014 Steve Bullock (@GovernorBullock) October 22, 2019\n\nOther Democratic campaigns have flashed fancy incentives for donations, including when South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigeig\u2019s campaign told donors they could automatically be entered to \u201cwin a trip for two to see Hamilton in San Francisco with Chasten!\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign has offered donors a chance to win to \"grab a drink\" with her, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang made a pledge during the September debate that he'd give 10 people who contributed to his campaign $1,000 a month.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/22/john-delaneys-world-series-tickets-campaign-donations/2452124001/", "description": "Democratic hopeful John Delaney, the first candidate to announce a 2020 presidential run, has been stagnant in both fundraising\u00a0and polling.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
