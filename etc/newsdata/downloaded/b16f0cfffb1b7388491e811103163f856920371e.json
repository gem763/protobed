The CDU and SPD managed to cling on to the leadership of both regions.\n\nThe AfD remains a real and growing threat. The party that came to the fore amid Germany's migrant crisis and has tapped into discontent over government policies ranging from immigration to the economy. It has seen its vote increase over a sustained period, shifting it from a populist fringe party to a mainstream threat to Germany's established parties.\n\nMeanwhile, the CDU-SPD governing coalition (which also includes the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union or CSU) looks more vulnerable at a national level given tensions over reforms and policy in government.\n\nThe Social Democrats are in the midst of trying to elect a new party leader before facing the decision of whether to stay in its partnership with the CDU \u2013 one that some party members feel has damaged the party's standing with its supporters.\n\nThe SPD agreed to take part in the latest coalition government only after the CDU's talks with the FDP and the Greens failed to form a coalition following a 2017 election, so it was always seen as something of a reluctant participant in the government.\n\nOn Sunday, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who favors remaining in a coalition with the CDU, came first in a party vote to elect a new leader at the weekend but fell short of a majority. A run-off vote will take place next month and a party conference in December must then formally approve the leadership vote, Reuters reported.", "description": "The position of German Chancellor Angela Merkel is looking increasingly fragile after a weekend of political upset.", "authors": ["Holly Ellyatt"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105945699-1559565130955gettyimages-1039171860.jpeg?v=1568597606", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
