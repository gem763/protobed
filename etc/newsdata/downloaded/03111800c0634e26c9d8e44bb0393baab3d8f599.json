The good news here is that the new model is coming to India after the Auto Expo 2020. Just like your typical cyclical generation update, the fourth-gen Jazz features a more rounded design for its exterior and interior and upmarket features. But the major talking point here is Honda\u2019s new dual-motor hybrid powertrain called the e:HEV that debuts with the Jazz. Let\u2019s read about the upcoming Maruti Baleno and Hyundai Elite i20 rival in detail.\n\nThe major talking point of the 2020 Honda Jazz is its dual-motor hybrid powertrain. While Honda hasn't revealed its technical specifications yet, it is expected to come with a 1.5-litre engine that's mated with an electric motor. Other suspected powertrains include a 1.0-litre turbo-petrol unit that develops 125PS. Closer to home, we expect Honda to retain the 89PS 1.2-litre i-VTEC engine and the 100PS 1.5-litre i-DTEC engine for the Indian-spec model. Expect the diesel engine to come with a CVT transmission as well.\n\nVisually, the styling of the new car has evolved and is a tad softer. Just like the Amaze compact, the nose on the Jazz gets that chopped look with a body-coloured grille that merges into the projector headlamps. At the side, the Jazz looks familiar thanks to its tall stance and identical ample glass area. However, as you move back, the rear part of the roof drops smoothly when compared to its predecessor. Dual-tone alloy wheels add further bling to the Jazz. Changes at the rear include split-LED tail lamps.\n\nInside, the Jazz comes with a premium yet minimalist looking interior. The 2020 iteration also adds in premium features like connected-car tech, digital dials, electric parking brake with auto hold and a bigger touchscreen infotainment system. Other features onboard include Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, climate control, cruise control, a multi-info display as well as keyless entry with push button start. Safety features include ABS with EBD, parking sensors with rear view camera, electronic stability program and Honda's SENSING. That last one adds features like collision mitigation braking by utlising a front wide view camera and eight sonar sensors.\n\n\n\nThe 2020 Honda Jazz will have its official launch in Japan in February 2020. It is expected to launch in India after the Auto Expo 2020. Naturally, expect the prices to go up over the current model which is priced from Rs 7.45 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). When launched, the 2020 Honda Jazz will renew its rivalry with the Maruti Suzuki Baleno, Hyundai Elite i20, Toyota Glanza and the Tata Altroz. Meanwhile, we have one request for Honda. Can we please have the Type-R variant in India, please?", "description": "The 2020 Honda Jazz debuts new smooth design lines and the carmaker\u2019s new dual-motor hybrid powertrain; will come to India later in 2020", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.zigcdn.com/media/content/2019/Oct/zw-honda-fit-tokyo-1_300x225.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
