In fact, the S&P 500 Consumer Staples (Sector) index has gained 19.4% year to date. Like utility, Consumer Staples is considered a stable sector for the long term as its players are likely to offer decent returns. It is known for its non-cyclical nature and often acts as a safe haven during erratic market conditions (read: Best and Worst Performing ETFs of Last Week).\n\nFactors Driving the Sector\n\nEscalating trade war tensions between the United States and China have been increasing the appeal of consumer staples stocks. This is because the sector generally acts as a safe haven amid political and economic turmoil. Stocks in these sectors generally outperform during periods of low growth and high uncertainty.\n\nRetaliating to President Trump\u2019s early August attack, China imposed new tariffs of 5% to 10% on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods, effective on some items from Sep 1 and others from Dec 15. The raised duties will be levied on nearly 5,078 U.S. products, including agricultural goods like soybeans and coffee along with whiskey, seafood, aircraft and crude oil. Trump responded by raising tariffs on $550 billion worth of Chinese goods. He lifted existing tariffs to 30% from 25% on $250 billion of Chinese imports effective Oct 1. Moreover, tariffs planned on a further $300 billion in Chinese goods will be revised to 15% from 10% in two stages \u2014 Sep 1 and Dec 15 (read: 4 Dividend ETFs to Ride Out Trade War Uncertainty).\n\nMoreover, the U.S. central bank has enacted its first rate cut since 2008 in July 2019. This is likely to lower bond yields and favor consumer staples ETFs. Also, there are talks that the Fed may cut rates in September. With falling rates, a rate-sensitive sector like Consumer Staples has every reason to outperform. These sectors are high-yielding in nature and should thus perform better in a low-rate environment.\n\nAlso, considering the current global growth scenario, geopolitical tensions and Brexit issues, investors demand for safer options like consumer staples funds may rise.\n\nConsumer Staples ETFs Up 20% or More\n\nThe trends have been benefiting consumer staples ETFs.
