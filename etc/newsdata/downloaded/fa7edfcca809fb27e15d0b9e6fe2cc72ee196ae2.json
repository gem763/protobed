The social media giant's AI systems were unable to detect live-streamed video of a mass shooting at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\nThe effort will use body-cam footage of firearms training provided by U.S. and U.K. government and law enforcement agencies. The aim is to develop systems that can automatically detect first-person violent events without also flagging similar footage from movies and video games.\n\nThe AI training is part of a broader effort to crack down on extremism on Facebook's platforms. The company has been working to crack down on extremist material on its service, so far with mixed success. In March, it expanded its definition of prohibited content to ban U.S. white nationalist and white separatist material as well as that from international terrorist groups. It says it has banned 200 white supremacist organizations and 26 million pieces of content related to global terrorist groups like ISIS and al Qaeda.\n\nExtremist videos are just one item in a long list of troubles Facebook faces. It was fined $5 billion by U.S. regulators over its privacy practices. A group of state attorneys general has launched its own antitrust investigation into Facebook. And it is also part of broader investigations into \"big tech\" by Congress and the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nAmazon, Apple, Facebook and Google execs testify on Capitol Hill\n\nMore regulation might be needed to deal with the problem of extremist material, said Dipayan Ghosh, a former Facebook employee and White House tech policy adviser who is currently a Harvard fellow.\n\n\"Content takedowns will always be highly contentious because of the platforms' core business model to maximize engagement,\" Ghosh told the Associated Press. \"And if the companies become too aggressive in their takedowns, then the other side \u2014 including propagators of hate speech \u2014 will cry out.\"", "description": "Social media company is moving to crack down on extremist material on its platform, including real violence", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/25/dd01e8d8-b74b-4758-b2d2-32f32b4c1316/thumbnail/1200x630/a5175a21aac9bc1b689d193dbf18e2ab/facebook-gettyimages-1125991908.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
