They were resolutely uninterested in material things, instilling in me a reflex that unswervingly took the opposite direction. It might explain why my first watch came not from them, but from a family friend; I was 10, and the watch was an Oris.\n\nIt was reliably unreliable, thanks to being driven by a so-called pin-lever mechanism, an inferior movement Oris was saddled with by a 1930s Swiss law called the Watch Statute that froze upgrading the internals without government permission, something denied to Oris until 1966.\n\nAt least my rectangular 1950s model had cogs rather than a battery, not that you could see them through its slab of a back cover that was given over to the brand\u2019s bravely regal shield.\n\nI have no idea what happened to the watch, but Oris is still with us. One of the 10 top Swiss brands for a moment in the 1960s, it survived the \u201970s and then settled into the value ranks, using movements from third-party manufacturers such as Sellita.\n\nIt's about $11,000, making it the most expensive Oris yet, but the Big Crown Pro-Pilot X Calibre still offers considerable value for money.\n\nBut things are on the upswing once more. The current range includes a slew of desirable dive models and handsome vintage editions. And, a few years back, an impressive in-house movement with 10-day power reserve made an appearance.\n\nNow Oris has released a cleverly tweaked version of this Calibre 110 movement in a thoroughly contemporary version that raises the bar in every sense of the word.\n\nThe so-called Big Crown Pro-Pilot X is the brand\u2019s most upmarket offering yet, with looks and price to match. Cased in titanium and mounted on a sleek titanium bracelet, the movement is not so much skeletonised \u2013 cut-away after the event \u2013 as designed from the outset to be the hero of the show, with everything revealed down to the coiled spring in the winding barrel.\n\nIt\u2019s a visual treat, yet displays the time with unusual clarity, the galvanised industrial-finished surfaces of the movement forming a fascinating backdrop to highly luminescent hour, minute and seconds hands.", "description": "Three new models depart from their heritage and venture into new territory.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2944%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_144%2C$y_359/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ac8eceb6be6de0d3fba8873d531bea6c7f4686cf", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
