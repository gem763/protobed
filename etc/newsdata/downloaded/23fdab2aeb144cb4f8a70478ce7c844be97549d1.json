But the moonlight is really going to interfere this year,' Cooke added.\n\n'This is not going to be like the Perseids, which knock your eyes out.'\n\nIn addition, this year experts predict that the shower will only generate around five\u2013eight meteors per hour \u2014 although there is the possibly that an outburst could occur, which would see the rate spike to around 100 each hour\n\nThe size of the shower is dependant on the nature Earth's passage through the comet's debris-filled wake \u2014 with greater levels of activity occurring when traversing denser parts of the stream.\n\nThe shower takes its name from the constellation of Draco, from where in the night sky they seem to originate, which can be spotted lying above the Big Dipper and Polaris, the North Star\n\nThousands of meteors were seen each hour from the Draconids in 1933 and 1946, for example, a spectacle that astronomers placed among the most impressive meteor storms of the 20th Century.\n\nNormally, however, the Draconids put on a relatively modest display in comparison to other periodic meteor showers.\n\n'The most important thing you need to know about the Draconids is that they are kind of an all-or-nothing meteor shower,' Dr Cooke added.\n\n'They either produce spectacular outbursts or meteor storms, or you would never know they were there.'", "description": "The October Draconids are meteor showers emitted from the break-up of the comet\u00a0Comet Giacobini-Zinner that are best seen from the Northern Hemisphere.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/10/19483878-0-image-a-7_1570613916408.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
