The card airs on ESPN2.\n\nAfter he suffered a neck injury in late 2017, Rosa was unable to receive proper clearance from UFC physicians. Not only did he have to pull out of his scheduled bout against Dan Ige at UFC 220 in Boston, Rosa was told by one doctor it was \u201cimprobable\u201d he\u2019d ever fight again.\n\nSitting in the doctor\u2019s office, Rosa wasn\u2019t willing to take no for an answer. He vowed he would one day compete again. At a Wednesday media day, Rosa recalled his frustrations during that time.\n\n\u201cI had that moment where the doctor said, \u2018You should consider hanging it up,'\u201d Rosa said. \u201cThat almost bought tears to my eyes when he said that. There was silence in the room. I stopped and I said, \u2018What\u2019s the other option?\u2019\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t really say, so I told him what the other option is: \u2018I\u2019m going to defy all odds and I\u2019m going to beat this. I\u2019m going to work hard and I\u2019m going to do everything I can possibly do to come back.'\u201d\n\nDuring his absence of more than two years, Rosa still has been active in the gym. The injury didn\u2019t prevent him from training. The native of Peabody, Mass., packed his bags and traveled around the world in search of the best gyms and physical therapy facilities possible.\n\nA miserable situation to endure turned out to be a \u201cblessing in disguise,\u201d according to Rosa. The time away from pro competition allowed Rosa to focus on priming his body in the most professional ways possible.\n\n\u201cI would train since I started training jiu-jitsu and MMA and wrestling. I just trained six hours a day, every single day, even on Sundays,\u201d Rosa said. \u201cEven though people told me to take days off, I didn\u2019t believe in that. I just thought the harder you worked, the better you got \u2013 which is kind of true. But you\u2019ve also got to take care of your body.\n\n\u201cLike my dad told me, \u2018If you don\u2019t take a break, I ought to give you one.\u2019 I think that\u2019s what kind of happened, and I broke my body a little bit and overworked it. But I learned from my mistakes and I\u2019ve built my body up to be the strongest it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019ll be Massachusetts vs. Massachusetts when Rosa and Bermudez square off. Now training mostly in South Florida at American Top Team, Rosa said he\u2019s never crossed paths with Bermudez.\n\nDespite \u201cThe Bermudez Triangle\u2019s\u201d submission prowess, Rosa said he\u2019s not overly concerned. He expects his game to be more well-rounded and his improvements to shine through.\n\n\u201cI just feel like he\u2019s a one-trick pony,\u201d Rosa said. \u201cI\u2019m a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and I train at American Top Team with the best fighters on the planet. \u2026 There\u2019s no denying that American Top Team has all the tools and people I need and I get the best looks. I know that if I can hang with those guys that are specialists in each thing that there\u2019s no doubt I\u2019ll be ready for Manny.'\u201d", "description": "After he suffered a neck injury in late 2017, Charles Rosa was told he may never fight again.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "John Morgan", "Matt Erickson", "Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Mike Bohn", "Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/charles-rosa-ufc-boston-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
