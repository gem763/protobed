Over the past week, the cheeky case manufacturer has been sharing multiple images of the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Max Pro on its website. This is despite the fact Apple hasn't launched the devices yet - or even admitted to their existence.\n\nNood has now taken its disruption campaign to Instagram where you can see a butt-load of new images. You've got to respect such abject brazenness. Here are the photos!\n\nThe following images were cobbled together by Nood Cases' talented design boffins. Needless to say, they are not official renders endorsed by Apple.\n\nWith that said, the case manufacturer is in a good position to know what the finished phones will look like. (How else do you suppose they have cases ready to buy at launch?) Subsequently, the images below probably aren't too far off the real thing.\n\nAs you can see, all three models of the iPhone 11 will come sporting multiple rear-facing cameras. This is backed by a recent specifications leak.\n\nIt's worth noting that these phones are all festooned in Nood cases - the finish on the actual phone body will look quite different. Nevertheless, the images provide a good approximation of the phones' overall size and lens placement.\n\nImages: Nood Cases\n\nImages: Nood Cases\n\nImages: Nood Cases\n\nImages: Nood Cases\n\nImages: Nood Cases\n\nImages: Nood Cases\n\nImages: Nood Cases\n\nImages: Nood Cases\n\nWe'll be up bright and early to report on the official iPhone 11 launch tomorrow.
