The main staircase leads from the drawing room up to a galleried landing with exposed trusses and beams currently fitted with theater seating and used as a cinema room. Two of the home\u2019s four bedrooms are reached via the landing.\n\n\n\nA second staircase in the study\u2014formerly the head teacher's office\u2014leads up to the other two bedrooms.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: J.K. Rowling Donates $18.9 Million to MS Research\n\nThe house has recently undergone a comprehensive modernization by the current owners, according to the listing. Mansion Global could not determine the identity of the owners.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the key things they've done is invest in the garden,\u201d Mr. Kannreuther said. \u201cThe gardens are magical. [They\u2019re] divided into various areas with hedging and a pond, and there\u2019s a really smart summer house structure at the end of the garden.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso in the garden are a range of brick outbuildings, including the former school bathroom block with a store room, utility room and separate log store. There is also a former air raid shelter, now used for storage space.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-110422?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
