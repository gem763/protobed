How much impact a fully healthy roster, an upbeat mood and a modernized on-court strategy will ultimately have on performance remains a mystery, but for now it\u2019s clear at least that these players have been enjoying each other\u2019s company.\n\nWhether through a trip to the Bahamas led by center Karl-Anthony Towns or the well-attended informal workouts on the court at team headquarters, the Timberwolves didn\u2019t have to share how-they-spent-their-summer-vacation stories when they showed up on Monday for the start of training camp. They spent so much of the offseason together they already knew the details.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been so responsive to sacrifice some of their summer, which is not an obligation by any sort,\u201d Towns said. \u201cIt\u2019s a voluntary thing to do, and every single person has stepped up to the plate and said they want to be great.\u201d\n\nThe trade demand made by Jimmy Butler shrouded the dawn of last season until he was sent to Philadelphia for a package highlighted by Robert Covington. Two months after that, president and coach Tom Thibodeau was fired just halfway into his five-year contract. Gersson Rosas and Ryan Saunders were appointed to fill Thibodeau\u2019s dual title, and several role players were swapped out in the first steps toward establishing a more collaborative and empowering environment with schemes on offense and defense designed to mesh better with the current state of the NBA. Nobody in the organization could ever recall so many players around the practice facility throughout the offseason.\n\n\u201cEvery year I\u2019ve been in the league, really, I would see a lot of guys at training camp. That\u2019s when the whole team would show up. But this year was more special,\u201d forward Andrew Wiggins said.\n\nPoint guard Jeff Teague at age 31 is the oldest of the 20 players on the roster to start camp.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more upbeat. I was telling someone earlier it kind of feels like New York City right now. Everything\u2019s fast paced, everyone\u2019s moving around, everyone has somewhere to be. Everybody\u2019s focused,\u201d Teague said. \u201cLast year was more like Indiana: Everybody was chill and relaxed. Kind of my vibe. It\u2019s exciting to see, though. I think everyone around here is happy with the way things are going.\u201d\n\nHere some other takeaways from the Timberwolves, on the eve of training camp to start the franchise\u2019s 31st season in the NBA:\n\nHITTING THE ROAD\n\nFor the first time in five years, the Timberwolves will hold a portion of training camp in Mankato, the small riverside city about 90 miles southwest of Minneapolis where owner Glen Taylor got his college degree in 1962 from what is now called Minnesota State University.\n\nThough the team will practice there on Tuesday and Wednesday before returning to home base, the out-of-own trip allows for a little more bonding time. It also restores the tradition of a team dinner at the Taylor house, with his wife Becky\u2019s lasagna as the menu feature.\n\n\u201cWe can really just focus on the work, the task at hand, and really set a tone for everybody,\u201d Saunders said.\n\nOPENING UP\n\nCovington played in only 22 games for the Wolves after arriving in the trade due to a bone bruise on his right knee. The injury he believed would be minor proved to be anything but that, and the angst of being unable to play for his new team clouded his mind to the point that Saunders recommended Covington see a therapist to help with his mental health.\n\n\u201cIt made me get to the point where I had to send my family away from me, just because I couldn\u2019t put them through that energy that I was feeling up top,\u201d Covington said, crediting the sessions for not only improving his mood but accelerating his rehabilitation.\n\nBIG WIG\n\nBeginning the second season of his five-year maximum contract, Wiggins will again be under plenty of scrutiny as a $27 million player who has yet to fulfill the potential he came with as the first overall pick in the 2014 draft. Rosas and Saunders have taken the positive approach while trying to encourage him to ditch the mid-range jumpers for more 3-pointers and layups.\n\n\u201cThat gives me confidence, and it makes me believe that this is my year,\u201d Wiggins said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA coverage: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The tension that the Minnesota Timberwolves lugged into last season has been long stamped out, replaced by talk of creating culture, establishing process and building relationships under a new regime.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Campbell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/media_day_timberwolves_basketball_46356_c0-137-3278-2048_s1770x1032.jpg?3a7a18b448230d6c451c0bfcf517ebb952a1a0e6", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
