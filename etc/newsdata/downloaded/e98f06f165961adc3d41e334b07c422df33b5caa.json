It boasted AI assistance that helped get brightness, contrast, and color right, a night mode that captured more details than the human eye could see, and a wild 50x optical zoom feature. The Chinese manufacturer went all out to dazzle us, the consumers, with its camera.\n\nAnd to a large degree, it succeeded. Yep, my colleague Ivan Mehta even wrote that you should leave your DSLR at home as long as you bring the P30 Pro along on your travels.\n\nAs someone who dabbles in photography, the P30 Pro immediately piqued my curiosity. So I decided to reach out to Huawei with a proposition: lend me a P30 Pro and let me put the camera though its paces. Unlike standard reviews, though, I wanted to test the phone with a specific purpose in mind \u2014 street photography.\n\nBut after spending a couple of months with the P30 Pro in my pocket, I\u2019m afraid I have to disagree with Ivan: you should definitely make space for your real camera \u2014 especially if you obsess over the little things in your pics. Now let me tell you why.\n\nPhotography is all about precision, the P30 Pro isn\u2019t\n\nLet me preface this write-up with a disclaimer: despite the criticism that follows, the Huawei P30 Pro is still a top-notch device with a camera that will serve most people just fine. It\u2019s far from perfect, but it was never meant to be a tool for professional photographers.\n\nSince I tried using it as a photographer, though, I\u2019ll address the shortcomings it has in comparison to a proper camera, namely speed, ease of use, reliability, and image quality.\n\nThis brings me to my first and my biggest problem with the P30 Pro\u2018s camera: it lacks millisecond-precision.\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s a drawback that nobody who shoots fast-moving environments can ignore. There\u2019s such a big delay between the moment you click the snap button and the moment the device actually takes a photo that even amateurs won\u2019t be able to ignore it. I haven\u2019t timed it, but it\u2019s enough of a gap to miss a moment.\n\nInitially, I thought it might be a matter of my shutter speed settings, but the issue persists even at 1/4,000. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the AI assistance,\u201d I thought. Nope, it wasn\u2019t. \u201cWhat if I turn off RAW images?\u201d Nope, that didn\u2019t help either.\n\nNo matter how much I\u2019d toy around with the settings, there was always a significant delay in snapping a photo. For the record, I tried the same with my old Samsung Galaxy S8, and didn\u2019t encounter this issue \u2014 even when shooting in RAW. It\u2019s possible other flagships suffer from the same issue, but I don\u2019t test phones all that often so I can\u2019t speak any further than that.\n\nObviously, the delay\u2019s not necessarily a deal-breaker, but if you shoot in situations where pace is of the essence, I won\u2019t count on the P30 Pro.\n\nMuch better with static scenes\n\nTake movement out of the equation, and Huawei\u2018s flagship handset becomes a much more viable camera alternative.\n\nI\u2019m not one to take images of static objects, but I gave it a try anyhow \u2014 and I wasn\u2019t disappointed at all. I\u2019m not a huge fan of Huawei\u2018s image processing algorithm due to its tendency to boost the greens and the blues, but that\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t fix in post-production.\n\nFor the most part, the images were sharp, with deep shadows and an aesthetically pleasing depth of field. I don\u2019t see any architecture photographers leaving their DSLRs at home, but if you\u2019re a recreational photographer, you\u2019ll be more than happy with the results.\n\nDealing with the camera app\n\nIn line with the common theme of this review, the camera app sports a variety of modes \u2014 like portrait mode and night mode \u2014 that casuals will be glad to take advantage of. But\u2026 I think its Pro mode is a bit undeserving of the name.\n\nWhile you can adjust the shutter speed, the exposure, the white balance, and the focus, I found it difficult to use the Pro mode in real-world scenarios.\n\nFor one, Huawei only lets you raise the shutter speed up to 1/4,000, but the device supports numbers much higher than that. That eventually forced me to use the exposure compensation option to set brightness, which was far from optimal.There\u2019s also no way to control depth of field, though it will automatically adjust based on the object you\u2019ve focused on.\n\nI appreciate the inclusion of manual focus, but there\u2019s no highlight peaking which makes it difficult to spot the areas the lens is focused on. This practically makes the feature unusable. I\u2019ve spoken about my fondness of the Pro mode on Galaxy devices in the past, but unfortunately Huawei doesn\u2019t even come close as far as camera software goes.\n\nPost-production with the Huawei P30 Pro\n\nMy favorite part of the photography process is when I get home, load up the images in Lightroom, roll up my sleeves, and start editing. One thing I stressed in my Fujifilm X-T3 review was how malleable its RAW files were in post-production. I could change the entire mood of an image by playing around with the color schemes, temperature, exposure, and shadows in Lightroom without affecting the overall quality \u2014 no artifacts, no hue spills, and no color patches.\n\nHuawei\u2018s RAW files, however, are tougher to manipulate.\n\nLightroom struggles to isolate shadows in P30 Pro snaps, which often results in excessive vignetting. I noticed a similar isolation issue when doing colorwork; just try fine-tuning the greens without spilling over into the blues and the browns.\n\nI\u2019m obviously nitpicking here, considering this is a phone camera, but you shouldn\u2019t expect wonders from the RAW files. The matter of fact is you won\u2019t be able to bend P30 Pro images in post-production like you could with a proper camera.\n\nOne last thing I feel obliged to mention: I had come also across some complaints about artifacts in RAW images taken with the Huaiwe P30 Pro, but after careful examination, I\u2019m happy to report my images didn\u2019t suffer from this issue \u2014 even when zoomed in. So at least there\u2019s that.\n\nThe P30 Pro made me miss my actual camera\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t picked up on it by now, I won\u2019t miss shooting on the P30 Pro.\n\nMy biggest qualm is it does nothing to instill confidence in my ability as a photographer \u2014 and that\u2019s the most important thing when picking a camera. Things move so fast out in the streets that missing a beat could quite literally cost you a shot.\n\nThe P30 Pro cost me a lot of shots. I\u2019m already extra pedantic with my shots, and I often end up doing multiple takes until I\u2019m certain I\u2019ve got the shot. The P30 Pro pretty much doubled the average time I spend on a snap. At times, I simply gave up.\n\nHere\u2019s an example:\n\nI spotted this moment walking around the center of Amsterdam, right next to the American Book Store at Spui. What I liked about this scene is that, coupled with the light on the white wall, the shadows on the left side create silhouettes, while the sun illuminates objects passing by on the right side. It\u2019s a nice, little juxtaposition that instantly captured my attention, but after numerous failed attempts, I ultimately moved on knowing I didn\u2019t have the one.\n\nI wanted to capture the two guys on the right side a little closer to the bottom of the image, but I mistimed the shot due to the camera\u2018s delay.\n\nThe photo actually turned out better than I expected, but check out how many attempts it took me to get to that final image.\n\nUnfortunately, this story exemplifies my overall experience with the P30 Pro. The delay in snapping pics made it dreadfully difficult to frame and time shots. It turned an activity that should be about capturing a moment I had anticipated into guesswork.\n\nIn turn, that made me play it safe. I shied away from experimenting with the P30 Pro. Instead, I defaulted to scenes I\u2019m well familiar with, scenes I\u2019ve shot before. I don\u2019t have infinite time to do street photography, and I want to present work I take pride in.\n\nThe pics I made with the P30 Pro are far from my best, but I\u2019m not ashamed to showcase them in a review like this. Would I put them up on my Instagram, though? Maybe on my Stories, but I doubt I\u2019d immortalize them on my feed.\n\nSure, I would still use the P30 Pro to capture a scene if I have nothing else at hand, but my first thought would be \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t left my camera at home.\u201d\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "I wanted to love the Huawei P30 Pro camera... but shooting street photography with it has only made me miss my real camera more.
