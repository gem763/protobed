Supplied\n\nColes' total supermarket sales rose 1.6 per cent to $7.7 billion, with a net three new supermarkets and 10 refurbishments augmenting same-store sales growth.\n\nOnline sales grew 23.5 per cent, helped by free delivery on large orders, house brand sales grew 4.7 per cent and new products including meat-free meat and a new marketing campaign, Good Things, Great Value, also helped buoy sales.\n\nFood and grocery prices rose 1.4 per cent, in line with inflation in the June quarter but well above inflation of 0.6 per cent of the September quarter last year. Higher prices for meat, dairy and grain-based products were partly offset by lower prices for fruit and vegetables.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColes' total sales rose 1.8 per cent to $8.7 billion. Liquor sales rose 3.5 per cent to $726 million as a strong performance by the First Choice Liquor chain offset softer sales at Liquorland. Like for like Liquor sales growth slowed from 1.4 per cent in the June-half to 0.7 per cent, partly due to the timing of holidays.\n\nConvenience/fuel sales rose 3.1 per cent to $264 million, helped by participating in Little Shop 2 for the first time.\n\nFuel volumes improved for the first time in four years - rising 1.4 per cent to 64.9 million litres after falling 14.8 per cent in the year-ago period - as Coles' fuel supplier Viva Energy cut prices after the pair restructured their supply agreement in February.\n\nIn February, Mr Cain said if Coles and Viva could lift fuel volumes from 62 million litres a week to 75 million and boost convenience-store sales, earnings would improve rather than just breaking even.\n\nMr Cain said that while tax cuts and record low interest rates were expected to flow through to retail spending, budget-conscious consumers were still chasing lower prices while wealthier shoppers were prepared to spend more for convenience, buying online and having groceries delivered through Uber Eats.\n\n\"It's still very much a tale of two cities out there,\" he said.\n\nWoolworths is due to release first quarter sales on Wednesday, with analysts forecasting same-store sales to rise by between 6.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent, buoyed by Lion King ooshies and Discovery Garden.\n\nWoolworths has outperformed Coles almost every quarter since the second quarter of 2017 and will be cycling relatively weak same-store sales growth of 1.8 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnalysts believe collectables programs are starting to lose traction with shoppers.\n\n\"In our view, shoppers are experiencing collectable fatigue following seven toy-based\n\ncollectable programs in 12 months: Little Shop 1; Christmas Little Shop; Christmas pop-outs; Fresh Stikeez; Disney Words; Little Shop 2; and Lion King Ooshies,\" Citigroup analyst Bryan Raymond said in a recent report.\n\n\"We expect incremental diminishing returns to be seen in further toy-focused collectable campaigns,\" he said.\n\nMr Raymond expects Coles' supermarket sales to stabilise in the December quarter, forecasting 2.3 per cent same-store growth and total sales growth of 2.8 per cent, but says Coles is likely to continue to lose share as the market grows about 4 per cent a year.\n\n\"This normalisation in growth rates is likely to be welcomed by the market, but continues to reflect a loss of market share,\" he said.", "description": "Coles posted its slowest same-store food sales growth in 12 years after struggling to match gains from free toys and free plastic bags a year ago.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1839%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5f114c175011a6bfd89951751a50d1a1a0c4376b", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
