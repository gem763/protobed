REUTERS/Peter Cziborra/Files\n\nWhile not unique, it is still uncommon at Test level to operate with two specialist sevens and Eddie Jones is a recent convert after being won over by the dynamism of the young English duo he dubbed \u201cThe Kamikaze Kids\u201d after pairing them for the first time during the World Cup warm-up games in August.\n\nThey are different players, different shapes, different ages and vastly different in experience to the Australian duo, nicknamed \u201cPooper\u201d, but all four will play a key role in trying to dominate the crucial breakdown area on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re very much looking forward to,\u201d Underhill told reporters. \u201cYou want to challenge yourself against the best in the world and it\u2019s fair to say they\u2019re two world class opensides. They\u2019re players who Tom and I, when we were growing up and coming through, looked at and inspired to be like, so it\u2019s a bit surreal to be coming up against them now.\u201d\n\nHooper, 27, will be winning his 99th cap, while 31-year-old Pocock his 83rd. Curry, 21, has 16 caps, while Underhill, two years older, has 12.\n\n\u201cTechnically they are both very good over the ball,\u201d Underhill said. \u201cPocock is probably the best in the world in terms of how strong he is, and his body position. On top of that they have very good timing.\u201d\n\nEngland coach Jones has been hugely impressed with his own dynamic duo and said changes to the way the game is being refereed, encouraging more of a contest at the breakdown, has persuaded him to go down the twinning route.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a great contest,\u201d he said. \u201cPocock has probably, over the last 10 years, been the foremost number seven in the world, while Hooper is a massively important player for Australia, but our two young boys are just getting better every game,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCurry\u2019s improved his line-out jumping immensely over the last eight weeks while Underhill\u2019s probably the most combative seven I\u2019ve seen for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe English pair certainly love the physical side of the game and that battle for every inch of space.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty gritty and unglamorous work. You\u2019ve got to enjoy that and you\u2019ve got to see how what you\u2019re doing contributes to the team,\u201d Underhill said.\n\n\u201cWhen the guys are scoring out wide it\u2019s usually because the forwards have done something good in the middle, something that\u2019s fairly dull to watch but that creates special moments in the game.\u201d", "description": "Australia's David Pocock and Michael Hooper, pioneers of the \"twin opensides\" approach to back-row play, will come face to face with England's copycat version in Saturday's World Cup quarter-final in the shape of Tom Curry and Sam Underhill.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442164449&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0BE", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
