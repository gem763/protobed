Even though SPD members ultimately voted in favor of renewing the coalition, the split in the party remains, with many rank-and-file members pushing for an early exit.\n\nThe party has been led by a triumvirate of senior officials ever since a string of ballot box letdowns earlier this year forced the resignation of Andrea Nahles as SPD leader in June. Responding to the party\u2019s steep slide, SPD mandarins promised more transparency and bottom-up decision-making, beginning with the selection of new leadership.\n\nMurky deals\n\nSPD leaders have been chosen in murky backroom negotiations between party power brokers ever since the workers\u2019 movement was founded more than 150 years ago. In a stark departure with that tradition, the party decided to open the process to all 425,000 party members. And instead of sticking to just one leader, the party\u2019s board encouraged male-female duos to apply.\n\nAfter several weeks of campaigning and nearly two dozen public debates across the country, six male-female pairs remain in the race. Voting got underway on October 14 and closes Friday. The party plans to announce first round results Saturday, followed by a run-off in late November.\n\nAs of early this week, about one-third of party members had voted. Polling has been sparse and a survey this month among SPD members put four of the six pairs within a few points of one another. Michael Roth, Germany\u2019s state secretary for Europe, placed first with 23 percent together with his running mate, Christina Kampmann, a regional politician from North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\nThough neither candidate has a national profile, the pair, by far the youngest on the ballot, has won over crowds with its freshness and unabashed enthusiasm for all things EU (\u201cOur answer to Trump is United States of Europe,\u201d Roth told crowds during the campaign).\n\nEven so, in the same poll, published early this month by Die Welt, 35 percent of respondents said they believed a duo led by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, the most high-profile figure in the race, would ultimately prevail.\n\nThough Scholz has strong approval ratings in Germany overall, he's controversial among his own party faithful. To them, he represents the SPD establishment that steered the party into the mess it's in to begin with.\n\nIt\u2019s an accusation Scholz has difficulty countering. The former mayor of prosperous Hamburg, Scholz, 61, has spent most of his working life in the service of the party, including a stint as general secretary under Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and as interim party leader. He has been a member of the party\u2019s executive committee since 2001.\n\nWhat particularly upsets Scholz\u2019s critics, however, is his strict adherence to Germany\u2019s balanced budget. Indeed, in terms of the government\u2019s spending policies, there is little difference between Scholz and his austere conservative predecessor, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, known and feared across the Continent for his bookkeeping mantra schwarze Null (black zero).\n\nScholz, who paired with little-known east German politician Klara Geywitz in the leadership race, is also seen as a guarantor that the GroKo will continue.\n\nDuring the nearly two-dozen regional debates, Scholz often found himself on the defensive.\n\n\u201cIn truth, no one really has a clue how this will end\u201d \u2014 SPD official from Hamburg\n\n\u201cOlaf, you admit to being a GroKo fan, so why should opponents of the GroKo support you,\u201d an audience member in Hanover asked him.\n\nScholz answered by trying to steer the conversation toward his many political accomplishments.\n\nEven his close associates acknowledge that his GroKo affiliation is his Achilles' heel.\n\n\u201cIn truth, no one really has a clue how this will end,\u201d an SPD official from Hamburg said.\n\nEven as many Social Democrats are convinced the GroKo is to blame for the party\u2019s historic slide, Germans overall continue to support it. More than 60 percent of respondents in a poll last month said they wanted the coalition to finish its term, which ends in the fall of 2021.\n\nA worse outcome\n\nThe danger for the SPD is that pulling out early, which would likely trigger a snap election, would do even more damage to the party than sticking it out.\n\nGermany\u2019s recent political history would seem to support that argument. Support for Germany\u2019s liberals, the Free Democrats, soured after the party leader\u2019s sudden decision in 2017 not to enter a three-way coalition with the Christian Democrats and Greens.\n\nThe liberals finished well ahead of the Greens in the last election but have since fallen below 10 percent. Meanwhile, the Greens have surged to more than 20 percent.\n\nAfter the liberals got cold feet, Merkel had no choice but to pursue another GroKo, which most of the players regarded as the least-bad option.\n\nThat same reasoning (\u201cthe alternative is worse\u201d) has frustrated GroKo death-watchers ever since.\n\nYet the leadership race gives the SPD\u2019s grand coalition-haters one last chance.\n\nThe final decision on the new leadership rests with delegates at a party convention on December 6.\n\nTwo of the six pairs on the ballot are avowed GroKo opponents. That means that even if Scholz manages to win the first round, there\u2019s a good chance the runoff will pit the pro- and contra-GroKo camps against one another.\n\nIn the most recent poll of SPD members, GroKo opponents Norbert Walter-Borjans, the former finance minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Saskia Esken, an MP, placed second, just 2 points behind the leaders.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility of a last-minute surprise.\n\nThe final decision on the new leadership rests with delegates at a party convention on December 6.\n\nNormally, that vote would be little more than a formality after the membership poll. But earlier this week, activist-comedian Jan B\u00f6hmermann, best known outside of Germany for taking on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, threw his hat in the ring.\n\nIn his first speech as a candidate, B\u00f6hmermann apologized both for the SPD\u2019s backing of social welfare in recent years and for the \u201cbloodless\u201d slate of candidates the party has put forward for its leadership.\n\nThough B\u00f6hmermann isn\u2019t on the membership ballot that closes Friday, he has a good chance of putting his name forward at the December convention. It\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll win, but the avowed GroKo opponent could shift the momentum.\n\nThe reason the leadership race represents the last chance for the SPD to pull out of the government is that Germany is slated to take over the rotating Council of the EU presidency in July. A collapse of the government in the midst of the presidency is something even the GroKo\u2019s detractors want to avoid.\n\nBy the end of the presidency, Germany\u2019s next general election will be less than a year away.\n\nEven if they don\u2019t get their way in the coming weeks, the SPD rebels can take solace in the knowledge that this is almost certainly the last grand coalition for the SPD in the foreseeable future.\n\nNow that the Social Democrats have been supplanted by the Greens and are tied for third place in the polls with the far-right Alternative for Germany, they\u2019re no longer GroKo material.\n\nGERMANY NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "Social Democrats pick new leadership, which could spell the end of the grand coalition.", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig", "Hans Von Der Burchard"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176406188-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
