He was the child predator whose documentation of the sexual abuse of children, mostly boys, was used to further the homosexual agenda in the 1940s and 50s. Literally thousands of children, including babies, were sexually abused for hours by Kinsey in order to see if they would reach orgasm.\n\nInstead of being locked up as a child abuser, Kinsey was held up by \u201cfree love\u201d activists as a hero. You can learn more about how this child predator spawned the growing movement to legalize child abuse at www.drjudithreisman.com.\n\nToday, the psychological abuse of children is becoming commonplace in the classroom. Graphic sex ed and even story time focus on sexual identity and activity.\n\nInstead of books about trucks or fairy tales, teachers and \u201cdrag queens\u201d read about vulvas, clitorises and penises, confusing otherwise happy and carefree children about their identities and introducing heavy subjects that kindergartners shouldn\u2019t have to worry about.\n\nOne of the most popular books, \u201cI Am Jazz,\u201d is based on the real-life account of a toddler boy who insisted that he was really a girl. The book description says: \u201cFrom the time she was two years old, Jazz knew that she had a girl\u2019s brain in a boy\u2019s body.\u201d\n\nYou know a culture is in serious trouble when adults believe that 2-year-olds have the ability to make such life-altering decisions.\n\nAs if the psychological abuse in schools and the media propaganda weren\u2019t enough, the courts also are being used to bludgeon parents who seek to protect their children: A Texas jury recently decided that the mother of a 7-year-old boy can abuse her son by forcing him to take drugs that will medically castrate him. Does this mean she also will have the \u201cright\u201d to cut off his penis when she feels like it?\n\nCourt testimony reveals that the mother dresses him like a girl, insists he call himself a girl, and has terrorized the child by locking him in his room and shouting through the door that monsters eat only boys. Yet a jury granted the mother full custody. The real question is: Why isn\u2019t this woman in jail?\n\nNightmare accounts of adults manipulating children and physically abusing them with drugs to halt their sexual development are popping up across the nation. In Ohio, parents lost custody of their daughter when they refused to administer hormones so she could \u201ctransition\u201d to a boy.\n\nThe American Principles Project (AmericanPrinciplesProject.org) reveals how homosexual activists lecture at medical conferences in an attempt to promote their radical agenda through family doctors throughout the country.\n\nThankfully, parents in both political parties are starting to fight back. Protecting children isn\u2019t a Democratic or Republican issue, it\u2019s a human rights issue.\n\nThe American Principles Project and other nonpartisan groups are now calling for legislation to protect children from the child abuse of gender reassignment.\n\nPerhaps one of the most powerful voices for protecting children and helping adults who suffer from gender dysphoria is Walt Heyer of www.sexchangeregret.com. Mr. Heyer was abused as a child, and regrets the \u201ctransition\u201d that he was cajoled into.\n\n\u201cSo many people who change genders realize later that abuse in their lives contributed to their gender distress feelings,\u201d he says. \u201cChanging genders is not the proper treatment for overcoming childhood trauma or abuse. Find someone who will address the underlying source of your distress without prescribing hormones or surgery. Avoid those who are \u2018transgender cheerleaders\u2019 and advocate for transition.\u201d\n\nAs our culture increasingly subjects innocent children to the twisted ideology of damaged adults desperate to validate their own disorders, America is quickly becoming a nation that promotes and propagates rampant child abuse.\n\nAdults who suffered abuse as children need help and healing. We do them a grave disservice when we don\u2019t love them enough to encourage them to seek counseling to overcome their pain. Allowing them to propagate their pain by harming children is just plain evil.\n\nGod calls us to stand up for the hurting and the powerless, especially children \u2014 even though we will be persecuted. May He give us the courage to fight and the wisdom to speak the truth in love.\n\n\u2981 Rebecca Hagelin can be reached at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
