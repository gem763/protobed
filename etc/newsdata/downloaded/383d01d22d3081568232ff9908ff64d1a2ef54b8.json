Vice President Mike Pence represented the United States at the meetings in Singapore last year.\n\nTrump's predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, by contrast attended every U.S.-ASEAN and East Asia summit from 2011, apart from 2013, when he canceled due to a government shutdown at home.\n\nAsian diplomats say the lack of top-level U.S. representation in Bangkok will be a significant if not unexpected disappointment in a region increasingly concerned about China's fast-expanding influence.\n\nTrump plans to attend the primarily economics-focused meeting of APEC in Chile, where he has said he hopes to sign the first part of a deal with China to resolve a prolonged and damaging trade war.\n\nHowever, diplomats and analysts say Trump's absence in Bangkok will raise questions about U.S. commitment to the region, especially after his withdrawal from the 11-nation Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement in 2017, shortly after he took office.\n\nLast year, Trump, who is currently embroiled in a congressional impeachment inquiry, sent Pence in his place to attend APEC as well as the ASEAN and the East Asia summits.\n\nMatthew Goodman, senior adviser for Asian economics at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, called U.S. attendance plans for Bangkok \"a real issue.\"\n\n\"As Woody Allen said, either 80 or 85 percent of life is showing up. And in the Indo-Pacific, that\u2019s definitely true,\" he told a news briefing previewing the summits. \"If you show up, you\u2019re given praise, whatever you actually say or do. If you don\u2019t show up, it\u2019s a real problem.\"\n\nAmy Searight, who was a senior defense official under Obama and is now a senior adviser at CSIS, said the EAS summit had become the premier strategic dialogue forum for the Asia Pacific, drawing leaders from China, India, Japan and South Korea, as well as those of the 10 ASEAN, or Association of Southeast Asian Nations, states.\n\n\"It\u2019ll be headlines in the region that no senior American leader is coming to a summit with 17 other leaders from the Indo-Pacific,\" she said.\n\n\"And I think it really does call into question ... how serious this administration is in its Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy,\" she said. \"And it really just calls into question the reliability of the United States as a strategic partner to this region.\" (Reporting by David Brunnstrom Additional reporting by Humeyra Pamuk, Matt Spetalnick and Steve Holland Editing by Leslie Adler)", "description": "The United States has downgraded its participation in back-to-back Asia-Pacific summits in Bangkok next week, a move bound to disappoint Asian partners worried by China's expanding influence.
