(Jeenah Moon for The Washington Post)\n\nThe gentleman ambling across the storied floor of the New York Stock Exchange hardly looks the part of the Wall Street sage. Rumpled and affable, he could be your barber. Put an apron on him, roll up his sleeves and he might be your favorite bartender, right down to the deadpan quips.\n\nBut millions of financial news junkies know Arthur Cashin from his daily dispatches on CNBC, a reassuring voice in the topsy-turvy world of stock trading. When the market roils, as it has in recent weeks, his insights and nearly six decades of experience are what the cable news network puts forward to bring context and meaning.\n\nAnd in an era when a White House tweet can quickly lay waste to billions in stock market value \u2014 including an unsettling amount in Americans\u2019 401(k) plans \u2014 Cashin, 78, is Wall Street\u2019s version of Walter Cronkite. He is one of the few financial minds with enough gravitas to scold Washington bigwigs without appearing political or to calm the half of the world\u2019s billionaires who bank with Cashin\u2019s employer, UBS.\n\n\u201cPart of it is representation,\u201d said Bob Pisani, a veteran CNBC reporter on the exchange floor who interviews Cashin regularly. \u201cHe is slightly rumpled. Always wears the same shirt and same ties. People say, \u2018This is a guy I can relate to.\u2019 He is an old-school market commentator in the best kind of way.\u201d\n\nCashin speaks of the market as though it were a living entity, imputing human characteristics to one of the most dehumanizing aspects of capitalism. It can be \u201cfearful,\u201d \u201ccomfortable,\u201d \u201csick\u201d or \u201cfeeling toppy.\u201d\n\nDennis Gartman, a longtime friend who publishes a daily commentary on the financial trade, said of Cashin, \u201cHe has seen it all, done it all, been through the bubbles, been through the crashes.\u201d\n\n\n\nCashin with a bottle of his favorite whisky at the Bobby Van\u2019s Steakhouse near the New York Stock Exchange trading floor. (Jeenah Moon for The Washington Post)\n\n'Now there is just me'\n\nCashin is among the few surviving floor traders who came up during the clubby days of the last century. A trading floor that once teemed with brokers and specialists \u2014 barking orders for now-faded names such as Bethlehem Steel and F.W. Woolworth \u2014 has largely given way to algorithms that have rendered the frenzy of stock trading into robotic transactions.\n\n\u201cI managed a floor staff of between 55 and 60,\u201d Cashin said. \u201cNow there is just me.\u201d\n\nWhat haven\u2019t changed are the huge financial stakes and the emotional tumult they can cause, and Cashin has the ability to distill and interpret market information in a way that resonates with non-Wall Street types. He sprinkles his daily markets brief, called \u201cCashin\u2019s Comments,\u201d with historical and cultural references ranging from Wild Bill Hickok to the sinking of the USS Indianapolis.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t sugarcoat news that can move markets. \u201cYou\u2019re the victim of the next tweet, my boy,\u201d he said of President Trump\u2019s running commentaries on Twitter during one volatile market stretch in May.\n\nWhen White House economic adviser Gary Cohn resigned in March 2018, Cashin cautioned that any more staff changes \u201cmight destabilize things.\u201d\n\nAnd Cashin is quick to call out what he views as doublespeak, even from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell. \u201cWhat the chairman did right now was he pulled a Goldilocks,\u201d Cashin told CNBC, commenting on Powell\u2019s handling of interest-rate policy a year ago.\n\n\u201cPowell tap dancing very well up there,\u201d he said on another occasion.\n\nTwo months ago, he warned that the slowdown in the global economy could reach these shores. \u201cBy the fourth quarter, you could be borderline recession,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to let it drag on too long.\u201d\n\nThen came August, which proved especially chaotic for the markets after an upside-down bond market sounded recession alarms and the United States and China flogged each other with retaliatory tariffs. On Aug. 23, with trade tensions ratcheting up, Trump called his handpicked Fed chairman an \u201cenemy\u201d and demanded that U.S. companies stop doing business with China. The Dow Jones industrial average dived 623 points, or 2.37 percent.\n\n\u201cWe may have a president who has learned his lesson,\u201d Cashin said after the sell-off.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what phone calls he got or didn\u2019t get,\u201d Cashin calmly told a panel on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell.\u201d \u201cBut I saw somebody who was trying to pull Friday back out of the fire. \u2026 I think he\u2019s going to be more modified from now on.\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur can say things that no one else says,\u201d said Michael Farr, a Washington investor and fellow CNBC contributor. \u201cHe is the voice of the New York Stock Exchange. There is no one else the world listens to as closely or respectfully as Art Cashin.\u201d\n\nHis life story\n\nCashin is an Irish American raconteur with a memory bank of tales that animate his life story.\n\nThere\u2019s the time when Cashin, in the middle of the night, has three continents waiting for his decision on a South African gold stock. His wife \u201cturns over in bed and yells, \u2018If I knew you were going to keep these hours, I would have married an obstetrician.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\nOf his only bid for political office, he said, \u201cI ran for mayor of Jersey City once.\u201d Then he waited a beat. \u201cI came in 12th in a field of five.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from Xavier High School in New York City in 1959, his parish priests put together the tuition for him to attend Fordham University. But his father\u2019s untimely death meant he had to get a job.\n\nA family friend helped him find work as a clerk on Wall Street. And his smarts and disarming personality did the rest. At 23, he became a member of the NYSE and a partner of P.R. Herzig & Co. In 1980, he joined PaineWebber and managed its floor operations until PaineWebber was acquired by UBS in 2000.\n\nThe Floor back then was a daily scrum of Darwinian capitalists making trades for the white-shoe lawyers, bankers and financiers who presided high up in their offices. Like journalism and bookkeeping, it was once a place where a young man without a college degree could advance through sheer hustle.\n\n\u201cIt was a melting pot,\u201d said Ted Weisberg of Seaport Securities, who is a contemporary of Cashin\u2019s. \u201cThey came from all forms of life. Some with college degrees. Just you and me, face to face, trading money and changing hands.\u201d\n\nAutomation has greatly reduced Cashin\u2019s staff in the past two decades. It did the same thing to the entire floor. There used to be close to 2,000 floor traders. Now there are a few hundred.\n\nCashin has become the floor\u2019s \u00e9minence grise. He is a steward of its traditions, which include raising money for charity and presiding over the NYSE\u2019s Buttonwood Club of 25-year veterans. On Christmas Eve, he leads a choir of traders singing \u201cWait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie,\u201d a tradition that dates back more than 100 years.\n\nOn a typical day, he arrives at his Wall Street office in the Trump Building, a few dozen steps from the NYSE, by 5:30 a.m. He devours five newspapers in the 18 minutes it takes his driver \u2014 Cashin\u2019s one concession to success \u2014 to ferry him from his Jersey City home through the Holland Tunnel to work.\n\nHe works on \u201cCashin\u2019s Comments\u201d with the help of an assistant, Judi Bartolomeo. (\u201cOne of the funny things is he has no skill at a computer,\u201d Pisani said.)\n\nAfter his daily comments clear UBS compliance, they are distributed to 100,000 of the investment bank\u2019s clients.\n\nHe spends about two-thirds of his day at his desk on the floor, where he puts on his reporting hat. \u201cHe is an old-school guy who calls up traders and asks, \u2018What do you think,\u2019\u201d Pisani said.\n\nJust before noon, he does his on-camera interview with Pisani for CNBC\u2019s website. Then he eats lunch at his desk, which Pisani called a \u201cnuclear waste site.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has papers sitting there from the 1970s,\u201d Pisani said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care. That\u2019s part of the charm.\u201d\n\n\u201cCashin\u2019s Comments\u201d has made his reputation as a market seer trusted by many, the go-to guy for confirming news or debunking a rumor.\n\n\u201cArthur is a very good observer of human nature,\u201d Pisani said. \u201cThe thing that matters most is the sharpness of his observations combined with his congeniality. Art Cashin has almost no natural enemies.\u201d\n\nHolding court after hours\n\nCashin has two assigned seats: One is in a corner of the NYSE, the other is at a Bobby Van\u2019s Steakhouse. Each weekday around 5 p.m., the Friends of Fermentation gather at the Bobby Van\u2019s bar, across the street from the exchange, to talk politics, sports and that day\u2019s trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of market trades. As the fermenter-in-chief, Cashin presides. \u201cLet\u2019s marinate some ice cubes,\u201d he tells the invitees.\n\n\u201cPeople go across the street to just be with him,\u201d said Kenny Polcari, who worked on the exchange floor for 34 years.\n\nPisani said he spent many a night there seeking Cashin\u2019s counsel.\n\n\u201cBuilding trust was not easy among the 5,000 people on the floor,\u201d Pisani said, so he asked Cashin and another trader, Jimmy Maguire, for help. \u201cThe bottom line was Art and Jimmy went around the floor and said you can trust this guy Pisani. That really helped open doors.\u201d\n\nCashin is partial to a good saloon. It\u2019s where he learned the game.\n\n\u201cThe things I learned in the saloons were not the same things you learn in places like the [MIT] Sloan School of Management,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually they were better.\u201d\n\nHe reflected on those lessons between sips of Dewar\u2019s on ice.\n\n\u201cThe reason I got into this business is there is nothing better,\u201d Cashin said. \u201cIt was you versus the rest of the world. It\u2019s a million people around the world trying to outsmart you.\u201d\n\nThough he accepts that technology has transformed his trade, he resists letting it take over his private life. Right down to his aversion to credit cards, which is most odd for someone at the center of the financial services industry.\n\n\u201cIf you pay in cash, nobody knows where you drink, when you drink, how much you drink,\u201d he said, peeling from a wad of bills to pay for a round. \u201cWith cash, you can have privacy.\u201d\n\nHe slid off his bar stool and headed into the night and to the car waiting to take him home.", "description": "When the stock market whipsaws, CNBC turns to the 78-year-old dean of the New York Stock Exchange to make sense of it all.", "authors": ["Thomas Heath", "Local Business Reporter", "Columnist", "Writing About Entrepreneurs", "Companies In The Washington Metropolitan Area", "Thomas Heath Is A Local Business Reporter", "Various Companies Big", "Small In The Washington Metropolitan Area.
