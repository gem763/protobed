And it\u2019s exactly the kind of campy romp you\u2019d expect, with plenty of singing and dancing by staff wearing outfits themed to the company\u2019s logo colours.\n\nIt begins with an ode to co-founder Bill Gates and the somewhat bizarre tagline that he\u2019s \u201cmore of an idea\u201d than a person. I guess the message is we all have a little Bill Gates inside of us? Then to the chorus of \u201cit\u2019s all happening here,\u201d the musical goes through a surprisingly candid history of Microsoft\u2019s many ventures and products.\n\nThere\u2019s a quick jab at the company missing a beat with Vista and my personal favourite zinger, \u201call around the world our products are well known, except for when we tried to make a phone!\u201d And they work in a few throwbacks, like former CEO Steve Ballmer\u2019s \u201cdevelopers, developers, developers\u201d chant and a reference to the gone-but-not-forgotten Office Assistant, Clippy.\n\nIt gets a bit cringey at parts, particularly when they start referencing Xbox and \u201clevelling up.\u201d But it\u2019s such an earnest effort that obviously took a lot of time to coordinate (eight weeks in total, according to their page) that I don\u2019t feel entirely right dunking on it. It\u2019s some refreshingly wholesome content on the otherwise burning trash fire that is my news feed. And it totally doesn\u2019t remind me of other instances when Microsoft has appeared in headlines. Not at all.\n\nThough, I will say, based on how much bank Microsoft\u2019s interns are purportedly pulling in, hell I might be chipper enough to make a musical too.", "description": "Next year\u2019s interns at Microsoft have a high bar to beat because 2019's class made a whole damn musical over the summer....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Ed Cara"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/bo9mfrcsoinomptdguxb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
