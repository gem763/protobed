Behold:\n\nMore from TVLine\n\nThe last time we saw the Friends together was at NBC\u2019s Must-See TV: An All-Star Tribute to James Burrows in Feb. 2016, although Perry was M.I.A. due to a prior work commitment. (He sent in a pre-taped message for James, so he was still technically \u201cthere\u201d for him.)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, however, this really is the closest thing we\u2019ll get to a Friends revival. Series co-creator Marta Kauffman has stated on numerous occasions that she believes it would ultimately tarnish the show\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cThere are several reasons,\u201d Kauffman told Rolling Stone in March. \u201cOne, the show is about a time in your life when your friends are your family. It\u2019s not that time anymore. All we\u2019d be doing is putting those six actors back together, but the heart of the show would be gone.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI [also] don\u2019t know what good it does us. The show is doing just fine, people love it. [A reunion] could only disappoint. \u2018The One Where Everyone\u2019s Disappointed.\u2019\u201d\n\nFortunately, that hasn\u2019t stopped the gang from staging its own mini reunions in other projects.
