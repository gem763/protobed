It did not give profit figures.\n\nInternational third-quarter sales including in China rose 27% to 2.5 billion francs, as Roche made inroads in the world's most-populous country with its older cancer medicines Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan, whose patents in Europe and the United States have expired or will do so soon, exposing them to competition from copies.\n\n\"Based on the strong demand for our new medicines and continued progress of our product pipeline we have raised the outlook for 2019 and I am confident that we will continue to grow beyond this year,\" Chief Executive Severin Schwan said in a statement.\n\nRoche's planned purchase of Spark, originally due to have been completed by now, is still undergoing scrutiny from U.S. and British competition regulators, though Roche stuck to its prediction of completing the deal by the end of December.
