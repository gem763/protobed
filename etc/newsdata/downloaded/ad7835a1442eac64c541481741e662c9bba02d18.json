It all feels rather bizarro, no?\n\nA year of wild Trump tweets on his trade war with China. Stocks have shrugged them off. It\u2019s been a year of decelerating global economic growth \u2014 thanks to that Trump trade war \u2014 and gloomy predictions from the likes of the IMF, and stocks could seemingly care less. Earnings growth in Corporate America has slowed noticeably through the first three quarters of the year. Mr. Market says who gives a damn, brighter days lay ahead in 2020.\n\nRecession calls? That was so summer 2019. Sub-$60 a barrel oil prices suggesting global economic doom lurking in the weeds? Nope, hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nYet, with just over two months left in 2018, the fear of missing out (referred to as \u201cFOMO\u201d on the Street) on more gains in the market is beginning to rain down on Wall Street sentiment. The purest form of that could be found in the major benchmark indices, notably the record-setting S&P 500. Year-to-date, the Nasdaq Composite is up roughly 24%, the S&P 500 has gained 21% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has tacked on 16%.\n\nThis market is on autopilot!\n\nTo be sure, the latest push higher in stocks has stumped many seasoned pros on Wall Street. The helping hand of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve has driven valuation expansion across many sectors. But by and large the experts are still in awe as to how bad earnings reports from a Caterpillar (CAT) and FedEx (FDX) could be overlooked along with a U.S. manufacturing recession and a sharp slowdown in Chinese economic growth.\n\nAdd to that Trump\u2019s \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal arguably doesn\u2019t amount to a hill of beans besides just cooling investor jitters.\n\n\u201cIf everything is OK on the economic front, why is the Fed cutting interest rates,\u201d Diamond Hill Capital Management portfolio manager John McClain tells Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. \u201cValuations are rich for what we are seeing out of economic data. We continue to see deceleration in global growth across the board. And what really is helping valuations is quantitative easing across the globe and supportive monetary policy.\u201d\n\nSo, then why the fresh records?\n\nWhy stocks are rallying\n\nThe recent surge in stocks could be boiled down to several factors.\n\nFirst, third quarter earnings season hasn\u2019t completely stunk. For every bad earnings report from a Caterpillar and FedEx, there have been more upbeat reads from a Microsoft (MSFT) and to a lesser extent Amazon (AMZN).\n\nAbout 50% of the S&P 500 have reported third quarter earnings, with bottom lines coming in 2% above consensus forecasts, according to Bank of American Merrill Lynch. After months of recession calls on Wall Street, by no means was an earnings season of beats priced into equities. Earnings estimates for the S&P 500 are now slightly on the rise, says BofA, supporting healthier valuations for companies. Capital expenditure spending also hasn\u2019t fallen off a cliff even as trade uncertainty persists, per BofA data.\n\nTraders Robert Charmak, Michael Milano, and Steven Kaplan, left to right, work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

That has underpinned the view that despite heightened trade tensions spurring job uncertainty, the economic engine that is the U.S. consumer remains strong with unemployment at 50-year lows.", "description": "Stock prices are touching new records and it's amazing considering all the negative news on trade and economy this year.", "authors": ["Brian Sozzi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GftM.PtlRwsux8ZAYDSmFg--~B/aD0zMzM5O3c9NTAxOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/5c22e970-f9a6-11e9-b7d2-0005d65082f1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
