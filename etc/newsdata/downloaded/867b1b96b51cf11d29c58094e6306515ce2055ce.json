I can never bring him back,\" Virgilio said.\n\nGonzalez family members gave emotional victim impact statements to the court on Oct. 4. The rest of the sentencing phase was continued to Monday.\n\nVirgilio entered a plea deal earlier this year, and the state agreed to a sentence of 30 to 70 years. But during sentencing Monday, the state pushed for 70 years, noting circumstances of the crime warranted the higher end.\n\nSpeaking on her behalf Monday, Virgilio's brother Reginald Carney, said she began to change after she started experimenting with drugs \u2013 everything from Oxycontin and marijuana to cocaine \u2013 at about age 20. She later graduated to intravenous meth use.\n\nARKANSAS WOMAN CLAIMS BROTHER FED HER 'METH SANDWICH'\n\n\"Her brain was fried from the meth,\" said Virgilio\u2019s public defender, Craig Howard.\n\nShe lost weight, kept a distance from loved ones and once tried to kill her child.

While he passed out or fell asleep on the couch early the next morning, she found a gas can and walked a quarter-mile to the nearest gas station to fill it.\n\nVirgilio walked back to the apartment and doused the couch, the carpet in front of it and the area in front of the apartment's only doorway with gasoline while Gonzalez slept.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe lit mail on fire and tossed it inside.

He died from smoke inhalation and severe burns.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "An Alaska woman who poured gasoline on a couch where her boyfriend lay and set it on fire before shutting the door and fleeing the apartment will spend 60 years behind bars for first-degree murder.", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
