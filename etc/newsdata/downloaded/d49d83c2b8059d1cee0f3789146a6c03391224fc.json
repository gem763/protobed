Where should I retire?", "language": "en", "text": "Dear Catey,\n\nWe\u2019re 69 and 68 respectively, and are presently retired in Las Vegas. Our net worth is about $5 million, so money is not an overriding issue.\n\nWe moved to Vegas to be near family, and for the vibrancy we didn\u2019t have in Cleveland. Seven years later, the family is gone and we\u2019ve had some health issues. Las Vegas is fun and a great place to vacation, but as you get older, the availability and competence of a medical system means much more than shows and casinos.\n\nMy wife likes the weather, but that said, summers here are hellish. California is out for the political and its ridiculous tax situation. Phoenix seems to have the big city feel and the amenities that come with that, but not only do you get oppressive heat, you get sandstorms.\n\nI know no place is perfect, but any suggestions you make would genuinely be appreciated.\n\nThanks for your consideration,\n\nD.S.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDear D.S.,\n\nGood health care and weather \u2014 and more reasonable taxes \u2014 are three of the most common requests I get from readers of this column. Plus, it sounds like you\u2019d like a large-to-medium-sized city with lots to do and a more politically moderate spot than California to spend your golden years.\n\nIt\u2019s a challenging checklist but I think I\u2019ve got some options for you. (Admittedly, it\u2019s hard to beat California weather, so you might have to endure some humidity, but I won\u2019t place you in a spot with cold winters.) Here\u2019s what I\u2019d suggest.\n\nHonolulu\n\niStock View of the beach at sunset in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nGreat beaches, friendly locals, and plenty of museums (don\u2019t miss the Honolulu Museum of Art) and restaurants are just some of the perks of living in Honolulu. Another bonus: Though the city is cosmopolitan, it has a slower pace of life than many large cities in America.\n\nThe weather and the health care will likely be big pluses to you too. Honolulu boasts two five-star rated hospitals, and landed on The Street\u2019s list of best cities for health care in retirement. And the weather tends to stay between about 50 and 90 (though winters can be a bit rainy) and there\u2019s a low risk of hurricanes here.\n\nWhile it\u2019s certainly not cheap to live in Honolulu (median homes will set you back more than $650,000), with your nest egg, you can likely swing it. Added bonuses for you: It\u2019s a more tax-friendly spot for retirees than California, though it\u2019s still not as great as a spot like Florida. One potential downside for you is that it might be a bit far from friends and family.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSarasota, Fla.\n\niStock Sarasota, Florida\n\nOK, admittedly, summers are humid and brutal (with that $5 million nest egg, you can get out of town during August though) and there is a hurricane risk, but hear us out on Sarasota: It consistently lands on best places to retire lists for good reason. It\u2019s got tons of cultural offerings, including a ballet and opera, as well as art museums and plenty of performing arts options. It also has great beaches, and a plethora of restaurants.\n\nAnd it checks a lot of boxes on your list too: There\u2019s a five-star hospital in town, and The Street named it as one of the best places to retire for health care, writing \u201cfive hospitals in Sarasota and another in Bradenton provides the kind of security that even competing Florida retirement communities are hard-pressed to match.\u201d Plus, the tax situation in Florida is pretty great, as the state does not have income tax.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not exactly cheap to live here, it\u2019s more reasonable than Honolulu.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDallas\n\niStock Dallas\n\nThe Big D, as Dallas is known, has good health care, with two five-star hospitals, the North Central Surgical Center and the Baylor Scott and White Heart and Vascular Hospital. And the weather checks a lot of boxes too, with mild temperatures for most of the year (though summers are hot and humid, but with your sizable nest egg, you can travel during the worst of it if you like).\n\nU.S. News & World Report recently ranked Dallas-Fort Worth one of the 10 best places to retire, noting that it offers \u201cboth big-city excitement and quiet, suburban living\u201d as well as \u201can interesting mix of Texas pride and cosmopolitan offerings.\u201d You\u2019ll find thousands of restaurants (barbecue and Tex-Mex are particularly good), tons of shopping (it\u2019s the birthplace of Neiman Marcus) and a bustling arts and culture scene, which includes the renowned Dallas Museum of Art and the Nasher Sculpture Center.\n\nThough money isn\u2019t a huge hurdle for you, the cost of living in Dallas is only a bit above average, and the tax situation is much more reasonable than in California (one big perk of Texas is no state income tax).", "description": "These three cities have good hospitals and lots of other perks.", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT535_honolu_ZG_20191017131944.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
