Anything and everything he does. No one will stop him. The Republicans are too morally corrupt. The Democrats are too divided and weak. The courts are probably in his pocket. One of these days, the four right-wingers on the Supreme Court will rule for Trump. Maybe John Roberts will join the liberals to hold Trump to account. If he does, the country may yet be saved. If he doesn\u2019t, this country as we\u2019ve known it is finished.", "description": "The president has all but \u2019fessed up to his latest impeachable offense, and Republicans are shrugging.
