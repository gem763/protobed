It can\u2019t be printed here. The result, though, can: They shrugged off what could have been a World Series-altering controversy and beat the Houston Astros, 7-2 . With steam coming out of their ears, they forced a Game 7. They took tumult and beat it back, with Stephen Strasburg\u2019s latest defining October start and Anthony Rendon\u2019s absolute rebuke \u2014 to the Astros, to the umps, to everyone outside that dugout \u2014 of a two-run homer.\n\nManager Dave Martinez was ejected? Juan Soto upstaged Astros braggart Alex Bregman with a titanic blast off Justin Verlander to take the lead? They seem like footnotes now. In a World Series that meandered through the first five games searching for a signature moment, Tuesday night provided a half dozen.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOh, and it leads to this: Max Scherzer vs. Zack Greinke on Wednesday night for the championship.\n\nInhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s review. It\u2019s worth it. Believe me.\n\nThe most memorable play of a dizzying evening came in the seventh with the Nats up 3-2 with no outs and Gomes on first. Turner hit the ball in question, a spinner in front of the mound that Houston reliever Brad Peacock \u2014 long ago a Nats draft pick \u2014 picked up and gunned to first. The throw led Astros first baseman Yuli Gurriel to move his glove to his left, into Turner\u2019s path.\n\nAs Turner ran past, Gurriel\u2019s glove popped off. Peacock\u2019s throw hit Turner in the back of the leg. The ball sprayed free. The result seemed obvious: Gomes to third, Turner to second.\n\nAD\n\nAnd then home plate umpire Sam Holbrook got involved. Holbrook ruled Turner had interfered with Gurriel by running on the inside of the baseline. Replays showed this was dubious. Had Peacock\u2019s throw been to the inside of the bag, Gurriel and Turner wouldn\u2019t have been near each other, and Turner probably would have beaten it.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Holbrook made his call and sent Gomes back to first, the Nats went ballistic \u2014 and then protested the game to Major League Baseball. Turner, whose heart rate rarely ticks up, was livid in the dugout. It took 4\u00bd minutes for the umpires, communicating with MLB officials, to reaffirm that Turner was out and, apparently, acknowledge the Nats\u2019 protest \u2014 though the protest was never announced.\n\nWhat\u2019s beautiful about this mess? Rendon and Strasburg made it not matter.\n\nAD\n\nWith two outs and Gomes still on first, Rendon feasted on a cutter from Houston reliever Will Harris. His two-run shot landed in the Crawford Boxes in left. The 43,384 at Minute Maid Park who came to see their team crowned a champion fell silent. The Nats\u2019 dugout went ballistic.\n\nInhale. Exhale. Do it again.\n\nIt would seem impossible for a team to rewrite its well-earned postseason persona in one month, but these Nationals have done that. The three games over the weekend at Nationals Park showed that. They were, from the home side, all duds. The crowds, all three nights, maintained hope. The people who filed in didn\u2019t change their expectations. The Nationals, with their actions and antics, altered those outlooks for them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt matters now \u2014 for what\u2019s to come Wednesday night, not to mention 2020 and beyond \u2014 that there is evidence the Nationals will step into the spotlight and thrive rather than run into a closet to hide. Drew Storen vs. Pete Kozma, Clayton Kershaw vs. Daniel Murphy, Matt Wieters melting down \u2014 those defining moments are still part of Octobers past for Washington. They just have company.\n\nIn that sense, the fifth inning Tuesday night fits \u2014 because they entered with a deficit against Verlander and exited with a lead. This team can draw from the moments when it flipped things this fall \u2014 Soto\u2019s eighth-inning, lead-changing hit against Milwaukee in the wild-card game, homers from Rendon and Soto off Kershaw to force extra innings in Game 5 of the division series in Los Angeles, Howie Kendrick\u2019s grand slam to win that game, the absolute throttling of St. Louis in the championship series sweep.\n\nCollectively, this one trip to the postseason has produced more moments you\u2019re likely to watch on YouTube over and over than the four previous trips combined. Then there was Jayson Werth\u2019s shot to win Game 4 against St. Louis in 2012 and Strasburg\u2019s rise-from-the-dead 12-strikeout performance to stave off elimination in Chicago against the Cubs in 2017. Anything else is kind of a stretch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo back to the fifth Tuesday night. Verlander had done well to strand five Nats over the first four innings, continuing a theme that developed over the weekend in the District. Although Verlander held the lead, the Nats had missed their share of pitches. A team slump seemed to have settled in. And then with one out, Eaton came up.\n\nEaton, curiously or stupidly, had bunted in the first. What would the bunter do with an 0-1 slider from Verlander? Deposit it in the right field seats to tie the score. Two batters later, here came Soto. Play this one on continuous loop, from the release of Verlander\u2019s 96-mph gas on the inside part of the plate, to the swing that assaulted the baseball, to Soto\u2019s reaction, holding the bat until he had nearly reached first base \u2014 a troll of Bregman, who had taunted the Nats with the same braggadocio after his homer off Strasburg in the first.\n\nOh, Strasburg. Right. Him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe didn\u2019t need another signature moment in October, but now he has one. No pitcher has ever finished a postseason with a 5-0 record. That\u2019s what Strasburg has now. The struggles in the first inning \u2014 two runs, shaky command \u2014 gave way to the dominant pitcher he has become.\n\nStrasburg is now in such control of himself, of his craft, that he can correct himself midstream. On Tuesday night, the correction looked like this: an efficient, 8\u2153 -inning, 104-pitch masterpiece in which he gave up just three hits after the first, in which he beat back two base runners in both the fourth and the fifth, in which he willed his team into Game 7.\n\nGame 7. Game 7. Scherzer vs. Greinke. Nationals vs. Astros. Relive Tuesday night in a hurry. Sort through all the heroics. Inhale. Exhale. Because here it comes.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "A controversial interference call. Dominance from Stephen Strasburg. Booming home runs to turn it around.
