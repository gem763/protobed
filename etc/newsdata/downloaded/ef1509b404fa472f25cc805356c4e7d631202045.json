Obviously any agreement must work for everyone, the whole of the United Kingdom and the whole of the European Union.\n\n\u2018Let me add also that it is high time to turn good intentions into a legal text.\u2019\n\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick last night said a \u2018great deal\u2019 of progress had been made and echoed that negotiators are working \u2018very intensively\u2019.\n\nHe told BBC\u2019s Newsnight: \u2018The EU is capable of moving extremely quickly if they wish to. Like any negotiation with the EU, and in fact with any major negotiation in life, everything happens at the last minute.\n\n\u2018This was always going to be both complicated and come down to the final hours and days, so this doesn\u2019t surprise me.\n\n\u2018We are going to work round the clock to try to secure it.\u2019\n\nBoris Johnson speaks after the Queen\u2019s Speech in the House of Commons on Monday (Picture: Reuters)\n\nEnvironment minister Zac Goldsmith was asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme if he would be prepared to accept a short technical extension to seal a Brexit deal.\n\nHe said: \u2018I don\u2019t think an extension is necessary. If both sides wish to secure a deal, a deal can be secured.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a matter of political will. Where there\u2019s a will there is a way, and that has never been more true than in the case of Brexit.\u2019\n\nNegotiators have stepped up efforts to work out a way to break the deadlock over the Irish backstop, the contingency measure to prevent a hard border on the island.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Cabinet briefing has been postponed by Mr Johnson until Wednesday as negotiators continue to hammer out a new deal in order to meet the Halloween deadline.\n\nThe PM has been under increasing pressure to concede greater ground to Brussels, with reports suggesting the UK has dropped a demand that a deal should include a veto for the Stormont Assembly on customs arrangements.\n\nIrish deputy premier Simon Coveney raised some hopes by saying \u2018a deal is possible\u2019, maybe even this week, but stressed \u2018we\u2019re not there yet\u2019.\n\nIn similar comments, Mr Johnson told senior ministers there was \u2018still a significant amount of work to get there\u2019 but a \u2018pathway\u2019 to a deal was still visible.\n\nMr Johnson needs to bring back a new deal and get approval from MPs by Saturday if he is to avoid a clash over asking for a Brexit delay.\n\nThe Benn Act, passed by MPs opposed to no-deal, including Tory rebels, says he must ask for an extension to Article 50 if MPs do not back a deal by 19 October.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has suggested the Government could use European law to bypass the Benn Act and leave with no-deal (Picture: PA)\n\nDespite the act, Mr Johnson has repeatedly ruled out making an extension request and reiterated his \u2018do or die\u2019 Brexit pledge.\n\nLeader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg yesterday suggested the Government could use European law to bypass the Benn Act and achieve no-deal.\n\nHe said: \u2018Theresa May got an extension not through UK law but through EU law and, until the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed, EU law is superior law in the UK.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Labour has threatened court action to force the PM to obey the legislation.\n\nNo matter the outcome of the EU summit, a showdown is on the cards during an emergency sitting of Parliament on Saturday \u2013 the first in 37 years.\n\nMPs will be asked to back or reject any deal presented to them and discuss what to do next in the Brexit saga.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
