Beyond the political, regulatory and commercial hurdles, HKEX is also demanding LSE walk away from its own $27 billion deal for data provider Refinitiv.\n\n\u201cThe Hong Kong exchange is seeing London Stock Exchange holders over the next few weeks to walk through the benefits of their offer,\u201d said Guy de Blonay, a fund manager at Jupiter Asset Management Ltd. in London. \u201cThat means going hostile is not out of the question.\u201d\n\nThe dealmaking involves some of the world\u2019s highest-profile financiers. Stephen Schwarzman\u2019s Blackstone Group is on one side, as lead investor in Refinitiv; on the other, Ken Moelis\u2019s firm is advising HKEX. The winner side will have to persuade the $320 billion Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund and the LSE\u2019s biggest shareholder, which has so far declined to comment on the HKEX proposal.\n\nEarly Friday, LSE rejected HKEX\u2019s offer, citing problems in \u201cstrategy, deliverability, form of consideration and value.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour assertion that implementation of a transaction would be \u2018swift and certain\u2019 is simply not credible,\u201d LSE said in its statement. \u201cWe see no merit in further engagement.\u201d\n\nNegotiations Sought\n\nHKEX responded by saying it\u2019s still seeking negotiations with LSE\u2019s board and hasn\u2019t decided yet to take the hostile route of directly making a tender offer to LSE shareholders, a person with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nIn the meantime, HKEX has quietly begun its campaign on the ground, citing analysts\u2019 criticism of the Refinitiv deal, according to people familiar with the matter. An Aug. 13 Commerzbank AG analyst report pointed to sluggish growth at Refinitiv and said a substantial part of its revenue base is in \u201cstructural decline.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the LSE has pinned its future on a world dominated by data with its bid for Refinitiv, the business that used to be Thomson Reuters Corp.\u2019s financial and risk unit. Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with Refinitiv to provide financial news, data and information.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, Li touted the benefits of enabling two-way capital flows between East and West, \u201cbringing together significant financial centers of Asia and Europe\u201d and facilitating an 18-hour trading day.\n\nThe business arguments may prove moot amid rising global political tensions. Protests in Hong Kong and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China could make the sale of the LSE to China-backed interests too fraught.\n\nDilemma\n\nThe LSE choice is between \u201cletting go of a deal that has much greater certainty versus waiting for what could in fact be more than a year of political deliberations,\u201d said Niki Beattie, founder of consultancy Market Structure Partners in London. Such roadblocks can \u201csuck the life out of the organization.\u201d\n\nIn London, U.K. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said on Wednesday the U.K. would \u201clook very carefully\u201d at anything with \u201csecurity implications.\u201d The British political class may also be unwilling to court controversy given the drama over delivering Brexit.\n\nUnderscoring investor doubts over HKEX\u2019s bid, LSE shares closed Friday at 7,514 pence, 10% lower than HKEX\u2019s 8,361 pence per share offer.\n\n\u201cThe LSE\u2019s board has mentioned a wide list of reasons for why it sees no merit for engagement,\u201d said Iacopo Dalu, research analyst at Janus Henderson Group Plc, an LSE shareholder. It\u2019s likely HKEX will \u201chave to go hostile, but if you do, the complexity of the deal increases and one of the reasons why the market isn\u2019t convinced about this offer is precisely that \u2014 because it\u2019d be hard to get approved.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Kiuyan Wong, Viren Vaghela and Aaron Kirchfeld.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jan-Henrik F\u00f6rster in London at jforster20@bloomberg.net;Sonali Basak in New York at sbasak7@bloomberg.net;Suzy Waite in London at swaite8@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Scent at bscent@bloomberg.net, James Hertling, Marion Dakers\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Charles Li isn\u2019t taking \u201cno\u201d for an answer.Rejected by London Stock Exchange Group Plc directors, the chief executive officer of Hong Kong\u2019s bourse is ready to make his case for the 29.6 billion-pound ($37 billion) takeover directly to investors.LSE shareholders \u201cshould have the opportunity", "authors": ["Jan-Henrik F\u00f6rster", "Sonali Basak", "Suzy Waite"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/V5JWJHHKw9urYoufRauBag--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/d802f44783b70c8dedf2745660b35a0f", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
