Certainly, the White House gets rights. The president gets rights that aren\u2019t there now.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, in an interview this week\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nThis argument \u2014 which featured prominently in Mr. Cipollone\u2019s letter and has been echoed by other defenders of Mr. Trump \u2014 misrepresents the separation of duties in Congress in regards to the impeachment process: The House investigates and charges, and the Senate holds trial.\n\nAllowing the subject of an impeachment inquiry to call witnesses or present counterevidence is not required in either the Constitution or House rules. The House Judiciary Committee did hear testimony from the White House counsel at the request of the Clinton administration in 1998 and allowed Mr. Nixon\u2019s defense lawyers to present rebutting evidence in 1974. But no such accommodation was made in Mr. Johnson\u2019s case, who was impeached by the House before it even drew up articles of impeachment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable for folks to suggest that the House should follow these more conciliatory precedents,\u201d Mr. Vladeck said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely false to argue that it\u2019s under any constitutional or legal obligation to do so.\u201d\n\nAfter a successful impeachment vote, the House then appoints lawmakers known as managers who essentially act as prosecutors in a Senate trial. The impeachment rules in the upper chamber do offer the impeached person some rights. Witnesses, for example, may be cross-examined and each side \u2014 the House managers and the impeached person \u2014 can make closing arguments before the Senate.\n\nWhat Was Said\n\n\u201cRemember when Pelosi said that the transcript would show a quid pro quo? It doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, in an interview this month\n\nFalse.\n\n\u201cNo quid pro quo\u201d has become a rallying cry among those opposed to an impeachment inquiry, particularly since the reconstituted transcript of the phone call between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian president was released on Sept. 25. (The phrase appears in talking points the White House pushed to its surrogates).", "description": "President Trump and his defenders have inaccurately attacked the impeachment inquiry for what they say are procedural and constitutional violations, a faulty premise and a lack of support.", "authors": ["Linda Qiu"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/us/politics/10dc-factcheck/merlin_162438645_4e4f2cf5-c38f-4bf4-a615-6ce42a608ca9-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
