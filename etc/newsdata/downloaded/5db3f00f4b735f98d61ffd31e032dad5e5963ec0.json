It\u2019s one of my favourite things about the game: You\u2019re wandering around, chasing some bounty or quest, and then you spot something. Something that maybe shouldn\u2019t be there, something that you could interact with somehow if you had the right item, or came at the right time. So let me tell you about some rabbits.\n\nOne of the first strange things I noticed in Shadowkeep were these little rabbit figurines. They were like little Funko Pop! Figures, strange little dudes with creepy glowing eyes. I noted them immediately in my Shadowkeep impressions, as did many players, like Kotaku Editor-in-Chief Stephen Totilo, who took the screenshot you see above. Here\u2019s one I found:\n\nThere are nine of these little dudes. It\u2019s not clear what they are here for, but if you play enough, eventually you\u2019ll get an item called a Small Rice Cake as a random drop that you can give to one of the figurines, causing it to disappear and be added to a collection near the Sanctuary base on the Moon. It\u2019s similar to a secret hidden in the Forsaken expansion\u2019s Dreaming City, where cat statues were hidden in various locations. Giving them a random drop called Small Offerings would yield part of a unique armour set.\n\nThese figurines don\u2019t do that though \u2014 all you get for giving them rice cakes is a chunk of experience. And it seems like there\u2019s a hard cap for how quickly we\u2019ll be able to collect all the rice cakes necessary to gather all the rabbit figurines \u2014 players speculate that the rice cake drop is limited to a maximum of three per account per week, one for each character you might have.\n\nThis implies that something might happen for players who gather all nine \u2014 why else would there be a limit? Why the arbitrary three-week minimum timer? There are also a few other small details tucked away in Shadowkeep that suggests there\u2019s more at play here. First, why rabbits?\n\nThe rabbit is associated with Daito, one of the fictional weapon manufacturers in Destiny. Most of their weapons are unremarkable fodder for levelling, but they do make a few exotics, like the Jade Rabbit exotic scout rifle. Daito has a room in the Tower that, upon Shadowkeep\u2019s release, was closed \u2014 the implication being whoever set up that room has moved on to the one on the moon for all of the rabbits you\u2019ve gathered.\n\nThis is all very spare, but you can stitch together a bit of a story here. While we don\u2019t know a lot about Daito, the lore entry for the Jade Rabbit rifle is unusual. It\u2019s not a snippet of story or a quote from a character, but an ad for Daito products that aren\u2019t weapons, but pharmaceuticals \u2014 products called Lunal and Immortalia, meant to combat the side-effects of all the resurrecting that happens to Guardians.\n\nIt\u2019s something that dovetails nicely with the real Jade Rabbit lore \u2014 an old folktale about a jade rabbit who lives on the moon, working away at the elixir of immortality.\n\nTaken in isolation, the lore entry for the Jade Rabbit gun is just a fun bit of allusion to an old folk story. But maybe now, it\u2019s leading to something else, now that the moon has returned to Destiny. It might not be much, mind you \u2014 perhaps just a new exotic quest or weapon, perhaps even the Leviathan\u2019s Breath bow quest that\u2019s scheduled to drop on October 22. It might lead to nothing, like the rogue cat statue found hidden beneath the European Aerial Zone. Or maybe it\u2019ll just lead to a very silly joke of little gameplay merit. No one really knows \u2014 but Destiny\u2019s coolest parts are often the puzzles \u2014 large or small \u2014 players that work together to solve.", "description": "There are more than a few mysteries tucked away in Destiny 2\u2019s Shadowkeep expansion, some more obvious than others.
