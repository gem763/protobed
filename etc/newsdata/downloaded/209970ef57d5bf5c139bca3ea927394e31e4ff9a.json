Biggs", "language": "en", "text": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi should formalize the impeachment inquiry by a vote of the whole House: Opposing view\n\nFor two years, congressional Democrats promised evidence of collusion between Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russian government. These allegations prompted the appointment of a special counsel, Robert Mueller, after leaks and manipulation from disgraced former FBI Director James Comey.\n\nMueller immediately hired a team of biased prosecutors to prove that Trump was guilty of the crimes he had been accused of. The anti-Trump inquisition cost American taxpayers over $30 million, while issuing over 2,800 subpoenas and 500 search warrants. No one could argue that this investigation was inconclusive.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Mueller report, Trump was cleared of any criminal collusion, collaboration or coordination with the Russians \u2014 something the American people knew all along.\n\nHowever, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and other House Democrats were not satisfied with the result. Many of their allies \u2014 and even some of their members \u2014 had been calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment since he was elected. No honeymoon for the Trump administration, only a constant clamoring for impeachment.\n\nSo, after House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler\u2019s inept performance in his unauthorized impeachment inquiry trial run, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi moved the ball into Schiff\u2019s court to investigate more allegations against the Trump administration: this time, the Ukrainian hoax.\n\nOUR VIEW: President Trump, your stonewall to the impeachment inquiry is cracking\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. (Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nSchiff began his tenure as self-appointed special counsel by falsely retelling the infamous telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during his first hearing on the whistleblower complaint.\n\nSchiff then took future hearings into an underground bunker, where the media, the public and even most members of Congress could not hear or see testimony. He lied to the American people about his committee\u2019s contacts with the so-called whistleblower. And he is concocting a narrative that could land him the Democrats\u2019 long-desired, political grand prize: the impeachment of President Donald J. Trump.\n\nThe American public, members of Congress and the media should not stand for Schiff\u2019s Soviet-style antics \u2014 especially when he is denying the American people and their elected representatives access to hearings, testimony and documents that are allegedly crucial to a future, potential vote.\n\nPresident Trump is well within his right to restrict members of his administration from testifying before Schiff\u2019s secret tribunal until Pelosi formalizes the process by a vote of the whole House. All Americans should demand that Schiff adhere to American values of due process, truth and transparency.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., is chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/10/22/president-donald-trump-rejects-secret-ukraine-tribunals-editorials-debates/2451208001/", "description": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi should formalize the impeachment inquiry by a vote of the whole House, writes Rep.
