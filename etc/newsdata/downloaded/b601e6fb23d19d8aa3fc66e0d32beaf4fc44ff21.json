BCS Brokerage also said earlier that an interim dividend payout would have a positive impact on the Moscow Exchange shares.\n\n\"The new dividend policy has been designed to balance long-term growth and financial stability with the continued strengthening of the investment case,\" Oleg Vyugin, Chairman of Moscow Exchange's Supervisory Board said in a statement.\n\nMOEX shares rose 1.9% on the day to 91.39 roubles each, their highest since Oct. 7, following the announcement on the new strategy.\n\nThe bourse's free cash flow, seen as a measure of profitability in financial analysis, takes into account investments needed to maintain and expand its business, as well as regulatory requirements applicable to the Moscow Exchange and its subsidiaries.\n\nRetail investors have been attracted to the Moscow Exchange as its key rouble-denominated index MOEX has climbed by about 15% so far this year and the average dividend yield of stocks traded on the exchange is at 7%, above an average deposit rate for banks, the Moscow Exchange said.\n\nThe central bank is the largest shareholder of the Moscow Exchange with around an 11.8% stake, followed by the country's largest lender Sberbank with about 10%, according to the Moscow Exchange data.
