This means a total collapse of the global economy, and not just Saudi Arabia or the Middle East countries,\" the prince said.\n\nAnd what about the drone attacks?\n\nSaudi Arabia says 18 drones and seven cruise missiles were fired on the country's two oil facilities in Abqaid and Aramco on 14 September.\n\nYemen's Iran-aligned Houthi rebels have said they were behind the attacks.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia as well as the US, a key ally, blame Iran for the strikes that knocked out about 5% of global oil supply and sent oil prices soaring.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has warned that Washington has \"many options\" in response, including an \"ultimate option\".\n\nWhat's the background to all this?\n\nIran is the regional rival of Saudi Arabia and an opponent of the US, which pulled out of a treaty aimed at limiting Tehran's nuclear programme after Mr Trump took power.\n\nUS-Iran tensions have risen markedly this year.\n\nThe US said Iran was behind attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf in June and July, as well as on another four in May.\n\nTehran rejected the accusations in both cases.", "description": "The Saudi prince says oil prices could be \"unimaginably high\" unless the world acts to deter Iran.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10FE2/production/_109020696_d995d5b2-9c5a-41ba-a977-ce1d5c0d8c0c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
