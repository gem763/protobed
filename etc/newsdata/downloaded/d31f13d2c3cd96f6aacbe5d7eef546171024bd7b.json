Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset, has 120 members, meaning 61 votes are needed for a majority.\n\nThe results remained fluid. Israel\u2019s television projections have been wrong in the past, first predicting in the last election in April that Mr. Gantz was ahead before the results swung toward Mr. Netanyahu.\n\nBenny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White party, in Rosh Haayin, Israel, on Tuesday.

He broke from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing coalition this year and has called on Blue and White and Likud to form a unity government.\n\nMr. Lieberman\u2019s Yisrael Beiteinu party was projected to receive 10 seats in Channel 11\u2019s exit poll, potentially giving him the ability to deny Mr. Netanyahu the ability to get to 61 votes.\n\n\u201cWe have but one option, a wide, liberal national-unity government,\u201d Mr. Lieberman said in a speech after polls closed. He called on Israel\u2019s President Reuven Rivlin to invite Messers Gantz and Netanyahu to an informal talk Friday.\n\nA clear picture may not emerge until early Wednesday, when results will show which of the smaller parties met the threshold of 3.25% of the vote to enter the Knesset. Even when the final results are in, it could take weeks of negotiations for a winner to emerge.\n\nThe election has posed a tough challenge to Mr. Netanyahu after more than a decade in power, as he faced an increasingly deep divide between Israel\u2019s religious groups and its secular society. Those differences threatened to overshadow the prime minister\u2019s efforts to stress his perceived advantage on security.\n\nMr. Netanyahu, already Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, looked to far-right and religious parties to secure another term as premier. Over the four-month campaign, he brandished his security credentials, touting his ability to protect Israel and the military operations his government has carried out in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Gantz, a centrist, tried to rally voters who are tired of the prime minister\u2019s long reign. A popular military chief under Mr. Netanyahu from 2011 to 2015, Mr. Gantz promised a tough security policy, saying he would deter Hamas from rocket attacks in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe election comes at an especially fraught moment in the Middle East. President Trump counts on Mr. Netanyahu as a close ally in Washington\u2019s confrontational stance against Iran. The tension surrounding Iran has heightened since the weekend, following an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry, an assault the U.S. blames on Iran.\n\nThough Mr. Netanyahu and President Trump have forged a close bond, the U.S. commander-in-chief earlier this year described Mr. Gantz as a good person. Asked about the election Monday, Mr. Trump declined to back either candidate and said the race looked close.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Who do you hope takes leadership of Israel? Why? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe vote\u2019s outcome will almost certainly have a bearing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Mr. Netanyahu has promised to annex swaths of the West Bank if re-elected, and Mr. Trump says he plans to release a long-awaited peace proposal for the conflict after the elections.\n\nThe election is the second this year, after a vote in April left Mr. Netanyahu and his allies unable to form a majority government in the Knesset. The prime minister failed because he was unable to bring together the secular and religious parties he had been counting on to form a coalition, including Mr. Lieberman\u2019s party.\n\nFor many Israelis, Tuesday\u2019s repeat election has crystallized into a referendum on how much influence religion should have in their daily lives.\n\nMessrs. Lieberman and Gantz had promised to form a secular government and wooed voters that object to the powerful role Israel\u2019s religious parties have in the current one. Mr. Netanyahu has relied on smaller religious parties to form governments in the past, allowing them to maintain control over marriage, divorce and Shabbat observance by closing businesses and stopping public transport on Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nThe leadership contest could come down to a decision by President Rivlin, the largely ceremonial head of state whose most significant constitutional task is determining who has the strongest mandate to form a government.\n\nThe first bite is usually given to the leader who receives the most support from across the different parties. With exit polls showing Mr. Lieberman with eight to 10 seats, he could be in a position to put either Mr. Netanyahu or Mr. Gantz over the threshold.\n\nMr. Rivlin\u2019s office said Tuesday he would begin consultations as soon as possible in a bid to swiftly form a new government and avoid a third election this year.\n\nThe exit polls set off a storm of speculation about how Mr. Netanyahu would maneuver to stay in power and whether Mr. Gantz could actually cobble together a majority to form a government.\n\nSenior members of Likud said their party wouldn\u2019t depose Mr. Netanyahu as leader but were willing to enter a unity government with the Blue and White party.\n\n\u201cThere will not be any deposing of Netanyahu. We are all standing behind him,\u201d said Miri Regev, a senior Likud minister, in an interview on Channel 12.\n\nHurdles remain high to such an agreement, with Blue and White\u2019s lawmakers maintaining their pledge not to let Mr. Netanyahu lead the government.\n\n\u201cWe will not sit in any unity government in which Netanyahu is the head of it,\u201d Blue and White lawmaker Avi Nissenkorn said on Israel\u2019s Channel 11.\n\nThe Joint List, an alliance of parties that represent most of Israel\u2019s Arab citizens, looked on track to increase its presence to be the third-largest party in the Knesset. An Arab party has never sat in Israel\u2019s government, intent on avoiding being connected with Israel\u2019s military campaigns against the Palestinians.\n\nIf Likud and Blue and White form a government together, Ayman Odeh, head of the Joint List, would become the first Arab citizen of Israel to be the leader of the opposition. That position traditionally brings regular meetings with the prime minister and classified security briefings.\n\n\u201cPerhaps for the first time, we\u2019ll lead the opposition, a respected position. I believe this is an important opportunity,\u201d Mr. Odeh said.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu will cease to be the prime minister thanks to the population that he incited against,\u201d he added.\n\nSome voters said replacing Mr. Netanyahu was their prime motivation for voting.\n\nDavid Cohen, 69 years old, from the Israeli settlement of Ma\u2019ale Adumim, said he used to be the head of its Likud party branch but has soured on Mr. Netanyahu in recent years. He said he voted for Mr. Lieberman.\n\n\u201cI am afraid what the Haredi are going to do to this country and what Bibi has given them,\u201d he said, referring to Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox population and using a nickname for Mr. Netanyahu.\n\nWrite to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com", "description": "Neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor his main rival commanded a majority after Israelis voted Tuesday, exit polls suggested, possibly opening a period of uncertainty over Israel\u2019s next government as conflict flares between Iran and U.S. Mideast allies.", "authors": ["Felicia Schwartz", "Dov Lieber", "Felicia.Schwartz Wsj.Com", "Dov.Lieber Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107739/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
