Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, is threatening to boycott next week\u2019s Democratic presidential debate amid accusations that the Democratic National Committee and the media are \u201crigging\u201d the 2020 primary elections against dark horse candidates like herself.\n\nGabbard, who reached the qualification thresholds for next Tuesday\u2019s debate in Ohio, called the qualifications \u201carbitrary\u201d and said DNC leaders \u201care trying to hijack the entire election process.\u201d She said she will decide in the next few days whether she will participate in the debate.\n\n\u201cThe DNC and corporate media are trying to hijack the entire election process,\u201d Gabbard said in a video posted on Twitter. \u201cIn order to bring attention to this serious threat to our democracy, and ensure your voice is heard, I am giving serious consideration to boycotting the next debate on October 15th.\u201d\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nGabbard\u2019s complaint about the DNC \u201crigging\u201d the primary election dredges up similar objections from 2016 when the DNC was accused of favoring former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cThe 2016 Democratic Primary election was rigged by the DNC and their partners in the corporate media against Bernie Sanders,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cIn this 2020 election, the DNC and corporate media are rigging the election again, but this time against the American people in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada.\u201d\n\nGabbard\u2019s move to possibly boycott the debate is a double-edged sword for the candidate, as she would miss the opportunity to reach millions of voters tuning into the debate, while the boycott would draw a great deal of attention to her campaign. The Hawaii Democrat did not qualify for September\u2019s DNC debate in Houston, but has met the criteria of 130,000 unique donors and hitting at least 2 percent in four approval polls to qualify for Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\nTwelve candidates have qualified for Tuesday\u2019s debate \u2013 leaving four who are still in the race on the sidelines.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThey are attempting to replace the roles of voters in the early states, using polling and other arbitrary methods which are not transparent or democratic, and holding so-called debates which are not debates at all but rather commercialized reality television meant to entertain, not inform or enlighten,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cIn short, the DNC and corporate media are trying to hijack the entire election process.\u201d\n\nTo qualify for November\u2019s debate, a candidate must reach 165,000 unique donors and reach 3 percent in four approved polls. So far only eight candidates have hit that mark, with Gabbard not being among them.", "description": "Rep.
