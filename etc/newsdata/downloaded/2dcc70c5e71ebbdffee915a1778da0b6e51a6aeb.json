The software and hardware he has developed at Elenium now enables airline passengers to ditch boarding passes and bag tags for a one-time registering of their fingerprint and facial features.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis combines with sensors and image recognition cameras that automatically verify them and their luggage throughout the boarding process.\n\nThe Voyager dream was set to become reality for the first time this year at Etihad's massive new Midfield terminal at Abu Dhabi International Airport, however delays have pushed that rollout to 2020, Mr Hornlimann said.\n\nIn the meantime Elenium is about to move from facilities it occupies across two buildings near Tullamarine Airport to a larger, custom-built facility at Essendon Airport.\n\n\"We manufacture all our hardware ourselves so we needed a lot more space as we scale,\" said Mr Hornlimann, who has recently been hiring mechatronic and electrical engineers.\n\n\"We buy some components off the shelf so we're not constantly reinventing the wheel. But if you want a bag-drop machine that's better than everybody else's \u2013 and ours recognises your luggage within 70 milliseconds, no matter how you put it down \u2013 then you have to make your own.\"\n\nElenium would conduct a pre-initial public offering raise in the next nine months, Mr Hornlimann said, with a listing \u2013 \"most likely on the ASX, but we're looking at all our options\" \u2013 to follow.\n\nThe November issue of The Australian Financial Review Magazine, including the 2019 Young Rich List, is out on Friday, October 25 inside the Financial Review.
