Mitt Romney (R-UT) for not fighting the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nMcIntosh told Breitbart News Saturday Matthew Boyle that Utah Republicans have become increasingly frustrated with Utah\u2019s junior senator on impeachment.\n\nThe Club for Growth has backed a resolution sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n\nMcIntosh said that the resolution condemns House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-CA) secretive impeachment inquiry practices, and fights back against the \u201cpolitical trial they\u2019re trying to execute.\u201d\n\nBoyle noted that many Senate Republicans such as Graham and Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Ron Johnson (R-WI) have vocally supported the president, while other GOP lawmakers have been notably absent in the fight against impeachment.\n\nFor instance, Sen. Romney, Susan Collins (R-ME), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) have yet to cosponsor the Graham-McConnell resolution to censure the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry practices.\n\nMcIntosh said that many Republicans \u201csuch as Mitt Romney, were going to use this as a political opportunity to take a whack at the president. In this case, I think he\u2019s jealous that he\u2019s not president.\u201d\n\nThe Club for Growth took out an ad in Utah, urging Utahns to call Romney and tell him to \u201cstop colluding with Democrats\u201d on impeachment.\n\n\u201c@MittRomney is working as a secret asset for @SpeakerPelosi and the Democrats, plotting to take down@realDonaldTrump through impeachment,\u201d the conservative activist group wrote in October. \u201cNow his cover is blown. Tell Romney to stop colluding with Democrats now\u201d:\n\n.@MittRomney is working as a secret asset for @SpeakerPelosi and the Democrats, plotting to take down @realDonaldTrump through impeachment.
