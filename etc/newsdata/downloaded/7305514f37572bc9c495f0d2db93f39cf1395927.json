The protesters said Iraqi soldiers had been stationed around the protest site but withdrew after the attackers began firing tear gas and live fire.\n\nThe provincial governor, Nassif al-Khutabi, denied that any protesters were killed but said there were some injuries among security forces.\n\nHe said videos that had spread online were fabricated and not from Karbala. An AP video showed a nighttime fire and young protesters, some of them taking cellphone footage, as gunfire echoes in the background. An ambulance can be seen trying to drive amid the chaos, and Iraqi security forces arriving at the scene.\n\nThe protests across Iraq, leaderless and largely spontaneous, have been met with bullets and tear gas by security forces from the first day.\n\nA protester wears tear gas canisters on his fingers Credit: AFP More\n\nAt least 73 protesters - not including the latest fatalities in Karbala - have been killed since anti-government demonstrations resumed on Friday, after 149 were killed during an earlier wave of protests this month.\n\nOne of the demonstrators said they were chanting slogans when an army unit arrived, and that they gave the soldiers flowers and had friendly interactions with them. Then tear gas canisters came spiraling into the square, fired from the streets and alleys behind the soldiers, who then withdrew.\n\n\u201cWe saw masked men dressed all in black and they fired live bullets toward the square,\u201d the protester said. \u201cPeople fell dead and wounded right next to me. We tried to escape but when we fled into the alleys we ran into moving checkpoints set up by these forces. They arrested people and searched their phones for video of what had happened.\u201d", "description": "Masked gunmen killed 18 protesters on Tuesday\u00a0in the Shiite holy city of Karabala, security officials said, in one of the deadliest attacks since anti-government protests erupted this month.
