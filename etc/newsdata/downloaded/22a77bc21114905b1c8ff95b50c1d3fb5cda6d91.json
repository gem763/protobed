Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nWill Smith plays two characters in the upcoming movie \"Gemini Man\": A 53-year-old elite hitman, Henry Brogan, and a younger 23-year-old version of himself, called Junior. The plot: Henry Brogan is suddenly being pursued by a mysterious young agent who can apparently foresee every single one of his moves.\n\nWhat makes this film stand out is that Smith \u2014 who just turned 51 himself \u2014 is not made to look 23 through the use of heavy make-up or conventional Hollywood anti-aging technology. Instead, Smith's younger version of himself has been fully computer animated.\n\nThis is a new type of special effects technology that is setting a trend for the entire industry. At least, that's what the company behind the animations is hoping for.\n\nTheir hopes could soon become a reality because the animation is actually very convincing. Many film critics, who have already seen the film, agree: director Ang Lee has done a great job.\n\nThe script for the movie has been passed around Hollywood for more than a decade\n\nThe script for Gemini Man has been circulating around Hollywood for about 20 years. Until now, filmmakers agreed that the technology was not developed enough for the film to be produced.\n\nSeveral actors \u2014 including Harrison Ford, Jon Voight, and Mel Gibson \u2014 all had their names attached to the project at one point. But the movie didn't move towards production until it came to director Ang Lee in 2017, who has already made a name for himself by directing films such as the Oscar-winning \"Life of Pi\" \u2014 another film known for its excellent visual effects.\n\nRead more: Will Smith says he fasted for 10 days and no longer needed a blood-pressure medication he'd been taking for a decade\n\nParamount Pictures commissioned Weta Digital, a New Zealand company founded by Peter Jackson, to animate \"Gemini Man.\" Weta Digital has been responsible for the visual effects in the \"Lord of the Rings\" series, Marvel films such as \"Avengers: Endgame\" and the \"X-Men\" series. Stuart Adcock, head of the Facial Motion Department, is convinced that the new technology they used in \"Gemini Man\" is a big step for the film industry.\n\nSeveral movies like 'Independence Day' were used to re-create Will Smith's 23-year-old self\n\nTo develop the technology, Jackson's team analyzed and processed Will Smith's entire facial and skin structure. But that's not all: they also took elements of Smith's younger self from films such as \"Independence Day,\" \"Bad Boys\" and even his most-well known role in the 90s sitcom \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" \u2014 all of which were used to recreate Junior.\n\n\"Gemini Man\" simulates Will Smith's skin structure on several levels and creates a network of muscle movements.\n\nAdcock spent months dealing with difficult questions about how the human body responds, like how fluid in the eyes moves when someone blinks or moves their face, or long does it takes for the blood to flow back into someone's forehead after they frowns.\n\n\"This was the only way we could be sure that the animated Will Smith looked realistic,\" Adcock said in an interview with Business Insider. It took him about a year to make the face of 23-year-old Smith react authentically. Since then, Adcock hasn't stopped paying attention to people's facial expressions \u2014 even in his private life.\n\nTo create the most authentic animation possible, years of detailed research had to be put in\n\nBut the animator still faces a major problem: the audience does not often tolerate mistakes. \"We've evolved to be experts in the most subtle things in the face that tell you this person's bullshitting you or this person's sick,\" Bill Westenhofer from the \"Gemini Man\" visual effects team told Wired.\n\n\"If we don't make our effects convincing, it's disturbing to look at them.\"\n\nConvincing audiences is also only possible if the actors are excellent, says Adcock.\n\nAnd it opens up new possibilities for cinema: \"The technology can make it possible for good actors to play more than just roles that are their own age.\"\n\nRead more: This Hollywood school trains aspiring special-effects artists\n\nAnimating the young version of Will Smith ended up costing almost twice as much as the actor's annual salary, the production claims.\n\nSmith was ranked tenth on the \"Forbes\" list of the best paid actors this year \u2014 proving that actors, at least, are not at immediate risk of losing their jobs to computer-animated \"competition\" thanks so the high costs.\n\nBut visual effects are playing an increasingly important role. At the IFA exhibition in Berlin this September, it was Adcock who was flooded with questions on stage \u2014 not Smith or Lee.\n\nThe dark side of the realistic technology\n\nThe new technology, however, raise questions about how it can be used outside of film.\n\nIn the last few years, so-called \"Deepfakes\" have been on the rise \u2014 videos of celebrities or politicians that look deceptively real, but are not. If technology falls into the wrong hands, what would the consequences be, especially in the current climate of false reporting and political uncertainties?\n\nRead more: This Is What Movies Would Look Like Without Visual Effects\n\nIt could also create something of a crisis for actors.\n\n\"The ability to create photo-realistic characters, to digitally de-age actors or digitally resurrect performances from actors who have passed, raises some serious issues,\" said actor, director, and animation expert Andy Serkis in an interview with Screen Daily. Serkis is most well-known playing Gollum in \"The Lord of the Rings\" movie adaptations.\n\n\"When your performance becomes data it can be manipulated, reworked or sampled, much like the music industry samples vocals and beats. If we can do that, where does the intellectual property lie? Who owns the authorship of the performance? Where are the boundaries?\"\n\nBut Adcock prefers to set his focus on the fictional world. \"There will always be people who use technology for criminal purposes. It's the same with Photoshop,\" he said. \"That's no reason not to develop them for films.\" He is aware that there are still some legal and ethical questions to be clarified behind the new technology.\n\n\"Gemini Man\" will be shown in US cinemas from October 11.", "description": "The virtual 23-year-old version of Will Smith was created by taking traits from his old films, including 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'.", "authors": ["John Stanley Hunter", "Sophia Ankel", "Business Insider Deutschland"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e14952e22af7528023498?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
