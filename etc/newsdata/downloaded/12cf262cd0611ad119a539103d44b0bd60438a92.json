A flotilla of luxury liners is coming this way", "language": "en", "text": "As for what excites voyagers most each year, new or refurbished ships are high on the list, followed by maiden ports of call and fresh itineraries, plus ships overnighting in Australian ports as part of their world cruise itineraries.\n\nGiven his day job, Katz is spoilt for choice on the high seas. This year, he\u2019s sailing aboard Cunard\u2019s Queen Elizabeth from Adelaide to Melbourne via Tasmania with his extended family of eight (spanning three generations) for his mother\u2019s 80th birthday.\n\nIf we had the ability to bring in more ships, we would. \u2014 Joel Katz, Cruise Lines International Association\n\n\u201cCunard comes with all the tradition of the brand, so we\u2019re looking forward to that a lot, and the facilities are varied enough that there\u2019s something for all the age groups,\u201d he says.\n\nAustralia\u2019s passion for cruising has hit only one snag recently: capacity constraint. For the decade to 2018, the nation recorded double-digit growth in new cruise passengers. There was a slowdown in growth last year, but the industry argues it was only because ships sailing in our waters were booked out.\n\nCrystal Symphony in the Whitsundays. During the 2019-20 \"wave season\", sister ship Crystal Serenity will be sailing the region.\n\nEven more ships would be good \u2013 but many of the nation\u2019s ports would need to be upgraded to accommodate them.\n\n\u201cIf we had the ability to bring in more ships, we would,\u201d says Katz.\n\nHe points to hopes a third port for Sydney could be finally on the cards, with plans submitted to the NSW government this year. In Queensland, the $158 million new-build Brisbane International Cruise Terminal will come online in August next year.\n\nIn the meantime, in a bid to avoid crowded capital city ports, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of exciting growth, with luxury ships in particular calling in at more regional ports like Albany and Esperance in Western Australia, and Queensland's Whitsundays, plus Mooloolaba\u201d, says Katz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe just-reopened wharf at Eden on the NSW far south coast has also attracted a lot of interest following its $44 million refresh.\n\n\u201cEden is a great example of a small regional community that has banded together with council, state and federal governments to welcome cruise ships to that part of NSW,\u201d says Katz. \u201cWhat comes from that is economic impact.\u201d\n\nTo help guide you through what\u2019s coming our way this summer in the luxury cruise space, here\u2019s a handy reference guide.\n\nRooms with a view: Seabourn Encore offers a limited number of premium suites, such as the Wintergarden.\n\nSTAY SMALL\n\nUnder 850 passengers\n\nIn service since 2017, Seabourn Encore carries just 604 passengers and almost as many crew. An instant hit with the Australian market for its intimate feel, Encore will visit a number of maiden ports this year, including Portland in Victoria; Hobart; Adelaide and Kangaroo Island. Its sister ship Seabourn Sojourn (450 passengers) will also visit as part of its world cruise.\n\nAnother evergreen hit with Australians travelling in the luxury category is Silversea. The Italian-founded line (in which Royal Caribbean bought the majority stake last year) has again spoilt Australia, sending south its newest ship, Silver Muse.\n\nSilver Muse suites are a sanctuary for the senses.\n\nCatering for 596 passengers with 411 crew, you won\u2019t want for much. Muse will sail between Sydney and Auckland from December, on a number of itineraries, including maiden port calls throughout the South Pacific. It will also carry David McAllister, the artistic director of the Australian Ballet, as a guest lecturer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile Silver Whisper (382 passengers, 295 crew) arrives in the region as part of its world cruise. After a couple of days in port in Sydney, Whisper will depart on March 20 next year, bound for Singapore.\n\nIf beaujolais is your thing, French-flagged Ponant carries a fine selection. The 184-passenger Le Laperouse has been doing the Kimberley cruise (Darwin to Broome and reverse) this year. Launched in 2018, Le Laperouse is still a new ship.\n\nIt will also visit Cairns, Sydney, and Hobart \u2013 plus do an expedition cruise from Hobart to Dunedin in New Zealand via the Subantarctic islands.\n\nCruise from Hobart to Dunedin in style aboard Ponant's Le Laperouse.\n\nAzamara knows how to get the party started by bringing a local focus to their popular AzAmazing Evenings. Azamara Journey (694 passengers; 390 crew) will be sailing around New Zealand, Australia and Asia this summer.\n\nOceania Regatta will do the honours for the Oceania brand. Regatta accommodates 824 passengers to 386 crew. The company is owned by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, which is also the parent company to Regent Seven Seas.\n\nAnother premium brand, Regent will have three ships in the region: Seven Seas Voyager, Seven Seas Mariner and the smallest of the fleet, Seven Seas Navigator, which carries just 490 passengers and 340 crew. Voyager and Mariner both carry just over 700 passengers with 445 crew.\n\nWind Spirit, pictured in Tahiti, is coming to Australia for the first time.\n\nFor the first time, Windstar Cruises brings its four-mast Wind Spirit (148 passengers; 90 crew) Down Under in early 2020. Arriving in Cairns, it will sail through the Torres Strait to Darwin then on to Indonesia.\n\nWind Spirit will sail the region, including time spent in Australian waters, through most of 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTRY MID-SIZE\n\n850 to 2500 passengers\n\nThe Crystal experience is something else. There\u2019s a reason this line is so popular. Crystal Serenity underwent an extensive soft refurbish last year, including adding new dining options. Carrying 980 passengers and 655 crew, Serenity will visit our region as part of its 105-night world cruise. The ship will sail across the Tasman to Sydney \u2013 then proceed up our east coast (with stops including Airlie Beach and Cairns) and on to Darwin.\n\nCunard's Queen Mary 2 and Queen Elizabeth in Sydney Harbour on a previous visit.\n\nBuilt in 2010, Cunard\u2019s Queen Elizabeth (2092 passengers, 996 crew) is a real-deal show stopper. Go Grills Class and experience first-rate butler service, not to mention the extraordinary food and wines on offer in the exclusive Queens Grill restaurant.\n\nThe QE arrives in Australia in December in time for Christmas \u2013 and will remain in local/regional waters for a record-breaking 101 days until March. Catch this queen before she departs.\n\nHer sister ship Queen Mary 2 will also come to Australia for 18 days as part of her 99-night world cruise, departing Southampton on January 10. She will overnight in Sydney on March 5.\n\nNoordam arriving at Melbourne's Station Pier a few years ago. Leigh Henningham\n\nThe Holland America Line is in the same stable as Cunard and Seabourn (Carnival Cruises). In a nod to the popularity of its relaxed premium vibe, the line will have three ships in our waters over the wave season.\n\nMaasdam (1250 passengers, 580 crew) is here now through to February. Noordam (1380 passengers, 647 crew), which was refurbished in 2014, will arrive in November and stay until early next year. Amsterdam (1380 passengers, 647 crew) will sail through briefly in March as part of her world cruise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGO BIG\n\nMore than 2500 people\n\nApart from diamonds and real estate, luxury is not generally measured in terms of size. But the benefit of a big ship is supreme stability \u2013 and on-board choice. There are more restaurants, pools, bars; more of everything really.\n\nDon't let scale frighten you. The luxury suites and exclusive areas of big liners are often referred to as the \u201cship within the ship\u201d. You\u2019ll be safe there.\n\nCelebrity Solstice only just squeezes into the \u201cbig\u201d category, with 2852 passengers and 1250 crew. She has icon status in Australian waters, with this year marking her eighth season Down Under. Solstice will visit a number of regional ports, including Eden on the NSW south coast.\n\nIt's big and it's back \u2013 Ovation of the Seas pictured sailing out of Hobart last year. The ship carries 4180-plus passengers.\n\nIf you want to really max out this summer but preserve some luxury, book a royal, owner\u2019s or grand suite aboard one of Royal Caribbean\u2019s megaliners, catering for 3500 plus. Options are Radiance of the Seas (now in her ninth season Down Under); Voyager of the Seas (it\u2019s just had a $97 million makeover) or the popular Ovation of the Seas, which arrived on October 20.\n\nBon voyage!", "description": "With one in 17 of us enamoured with cruising, it\u2019s no surprise that an unprecedented 60 ships are headed Down Under this season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4761%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_516%2C$y_324/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/108a26eb4606701254f8a6ed1a7e07ed0b673dcd", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
