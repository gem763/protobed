In his introduction to the recent Motu Proprio, \u2018Vos estis lux mundi\u2019, Pope Francis acknowledged the \u201cphysical, psychological and spiritual damage\u201d done to the victims of child sexual abuse, and added that \u201ca continuous and profound conversion of hearts is needed, attested by concrete and effective actions that involve everyone in the Church\u201d.", "description": "The Pope has been criticised by the government-ordered child sex abuse inquiry after the Vatican refused to provide cruicial evidence.", "authors": ["Gabriella Swerling", "Social", "Religious Affairs Editor", "Telegraph View", "William Hague", "Michael Deacon"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/09/TELEMMGLPICT000196565289-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
