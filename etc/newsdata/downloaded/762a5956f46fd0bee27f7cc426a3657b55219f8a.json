And even the best plans must be flexible enough to accommodate necessary changes, to prevent the perfect from being the enemy of the good,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe added:\n\nThe presidential aspirants are not short on big ideas. But voters must demand they explain how they intend to move from proposing plans to actually implementing them, including passing them through Congress. Those who dodge the question by speaking of revolution and the bully pulpit aren\u2019t up to the job.\n\nThe op-ed follows reports of Bloomberg\u2019s rumored reconsideration of a presidential bid. While he announced his intention of staying out of the presidential race due to the \u201cdifficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field\u201d in March, Biden\u2019s slow and steady fall has the former mayor rethinking his decision.\n\nBloomberg has told associates that he is considering throwing his hat in the presidential ring of Biden drops out.\n\n\u201cBloomberg is in if Biden is out,\u201d a source, described as a \u201cNew York billionaire with ties to Bloomberg,\u201d told CNBC.\n\nAs CNBC reported:\n\nBloomberg has signaled he\u2019s \u201cstill looking at\u201d running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden\u2019s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.\n\nWhile Biden has not signaled any intention to drop out of the race, his lackluster debate performance is not expected to elevate his position in the polls. The former vice president failed to have a breakout moment during the three-hour debate and experienced at least seven gaffes, mistakenly pronouncing exponentially as \u201cexpodentially,\u201d mentioning Roe. v Wade before correcting himself to the subject of gun sales, and claiming that people are \u201cclipping coupons in the stock market\u201d during a discussion on the economy:\n\n#NEW: Former VP Biden on reforming the U.S. tax system: \u201cWhy in God's should someone who's clipping coupons in the stock market \u2026 pay a lower tax rate than someone who is a school teacher and a firefighter?\u201d pic.twitter.com/FCHBBZr3KL \u2014 Alex Salvi (@alexsalvinews) October 16, 2019\n\nIf Bloomberg does, in fact, jump into the presidential ring in coming months, he would likely face questions surrounding his recent praise of China\u2013 particularly that Chinese Communist Party chairman Xi Jinping is \u201cnot a dictator\u201d:\n\n.@MikeBloomberg tells @FiringLineShow that China's leader is addressing pollution to satisfy constituents & secure his political future.\n\n\"The Communist Party wants to stay in power in China and they listen to the public,\" he says. pic.twitter.com/B9SoAXJwrM \u2014 Firing Line with Margaret Hoover (@FiringLineShow) September 27, 2019", "description": "Michael Bloomberg said Democrat candidates need to tell voters how they will practically implement their lofty policy proposals.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/09/Michael-Bloomberg.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
