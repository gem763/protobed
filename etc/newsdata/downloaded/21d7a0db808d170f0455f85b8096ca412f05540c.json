The report was finished in June 2017, but it appears to have included data only through 2016, before the Trump administration took office.\n\nThe report released on Monday was heavily redacted, and at least in the public portions it did little to answer questions about how prevalent child sexual abuse was in the Afghan military and police, and how commonly the American military looked the other way at the widespread practice of bacha bazi, or \u201cboy play,\u201d in which some Afghan commanders keep underage boys as sex slaves.", "description": "A special inspector says the American military uses loopholes to exempt Afghan security forces from punishment for enslaving and raping children, and other gross human rights violations.", "authors": ["Rod Nordland"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/25/world/24afghan-childabuse-promo/24afghan-childabuse-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2018-01-23"}
