A night at Seoul Shakers. Photo: Michael Graydon & Nikole Herriott/Michael Graydon\n\nLong considered the center of Canada\u2019s self-contained universe, Toronto has seen considerable growth, culturally and commercially, over the past decade. Or, to quote hometown hero Drake, \u201cShit is hot up in the 6 right now.\u201d And not just because of the Raptors\u2019 recent NBA championship or the Museum of Contemporary Art\u2019s multimillion-dollar makeover. Researchers at Ryerson University declared Toronto the continent\u2019s fastest-growing city earlier this summer, with new-arrival numbers (around 77,000 people last year) far outpacing those of Phoenix, San Antonio, Fort Worth, and Seattle. But much like North America\u2019s other top-ten cities in terms of population totals and pressing redevelopment plans (Houston, L.A., New York), Ontario\u2019s capital is often caught between its steadfast ambition and looming concerns over affordability and sustainability. That doesn\u2019t seem to be deterring residents from riding out the rising costs and extortionate real estate. Torontonians are very passionate about being Torontonians. A lot of that has to do with the city\u2019s diversity; as of the last census, more than half of its 2.73 million people identified as \u201cvisible minorities,\u201d and 46.1 percent fell under \u201cforeign born.\u201d Couple that with the sheer density and scale of Toronto\u2019s 140 official neighborhoods and you\u2019re left with a detailed snapshot of Canada itself. The fall, when the air is crisp and comforting (and before things get dreary), is the ideal time to explore its extremely accessible green spaces, eclectic food scene, and back-alley clothing boutiques.\n\n1. Art Four Ways\n\nAccording to Rachel Hilton, the managing director of MoCA, which unveiled its long-awaited new location in Toronto\u2019s Junction Triangle last year.\n\nAvoid Crowds in a Former Tank House\n\nCorkin Gallery\n\n\u201cThe Distillery District, just southeast of downtown, is a bit of a tourist destination, but I love this big space (7 Tank House Ln.) \u2014 a 10,000-square-foot former tank house \u2014 because it\u2019s a refuge from the hordes, and its nooks and crannies are a great backdrop for large-scale work like last spring\u2019s Leopold Plotek exhibit.\u201d\n\nVisit a Museum Inside a Museum\n\nThe Henry Moore Sculpture Centre at the Art Gallery of Ontario\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only permanent gallery I always visit when I\u2019m at the AGO (317 Dundas St. W), and it\u2019s one of the largest public collections of Moore\u2019s work. It\u2019s usually very quiet and serene here and feels like I have a private audience with all the pieces.\u201d\n\nSee the World\u2019s Only Airport-Installed Richard Serra\n\nTilted Spheres at Toronto Pearson Airport\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m flying, I make a point of walking through this immense work, a tunnel-like structure of four curved metal pieces standing sentinel amidst two duty-free shops. I\u2019m really happy to see the Greater Toronto Airports Authority invest in this great Serra piece, whether travelers appreciate it as art or not.\u201d\n\nHang Out in a Giant Canoe Above the Highway\n\nTom Thomson\u2019s Canoe\n\n\u201cPublic art doesn\u2019t get more Canadian than a big canoe \u2014 big enough for you to stand in. It\u2019s down by the waterfront, near the CN Tower, overlooking the expressway traffic. Douglas Coupland (one of the curators of our forthcoming \u2018Age of You\u2019 exhibition) created it as a tribute to the great landscape painter and Group of Seven member Tom Thomson.\u201d\n\n2. Classic Pho and Cacio e Pepe With Wontons\n\nTraditional and newfangled takes on the city\u2019s world-class Asian cuisine, recommended by chefs and restaurateurs.\n\nSushi Kaji (left) and Vit B\u00e9o.

And the owners treat you like royalty. I get the spicy kimchee, pork belly, and fried chicken.\u201d \u2014Grant van Gameren, executive chef of Bar Isabel and Piquette\n\nNew School: Seoul Shakers, 1241 Bloor St. W\n\n\u201cI appreciate chef Leemo Han\u2019s design sense; all of his spots feel like they have been there forever \u2014 like a secret gem only the people there know about. Get the Korean tacos.\u201d\n\nJapanese\n\nOld School: Sushi Kaji, 860 the Queensway\n\n\u201cMost of the ingredients are imported from Japan, and nothing is \u00e0 la carte; there are three different tiers of tasting menus instead. The quality never wavers.\u201d \u2014Jen Agg, writer and restaurateur\n\nNew School: Sakai Bar, 1576 Dundas St. W\n\n\u201cChef Eric McDonald is cooking at such a high level, especially considering how young he is \u2014 he just turned 23. I dream about their seasonal vegetables with umeboshi beurre blanc.\u201d\n\nChinese\n\nOld School: Kenny\u2019s Noodle Restaurant, 4733 Steeles Ave. E\n\n\u201cI go here for baked rice with Portugese-style chicken, a Hong Kong caf\u00e9 dish that was fusionized in Macau and Canada. Add cheese on top and it\u2019s a weird colonial British casserole.\u201d \u2014Craig Wong, executive chef and co-owner of Patois\n\nNew School: Alma, 1194 Bloor St. W\n\n\u201cChef Anna Chen has worked at Italian restaurants, so she mixes that training with Chinese food. She makes a pasta with pork wontons and soy sauce, kind of like a take on cacio e pepe.\u201d\n\nVietnamese\n\nOld School: Pho Linh, 1156 College St.\n\n\u201cThe best classic pho in town. It\u2019s also one of the only places that has b\u00e1nh cuon (rice-flour rolls stuffed with pork) and b\u00e1nh b\u00e8o (mini-pancakes topped with dried shrimp).\u201d \u2014Len Senater, owner of the Depanneur\n\nNew School: Vit B\u00e9o, 858 Bloor St. W\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of b\u00e1nh m\u00ec places, but here they serve scratch-made sandwiches with a serious flavor profile; it\u2019s like the difference between grabbing a fast-food burger and sitting down for a real-deal homemade burger.\u201d\n\n3. The One Sandwich to Eat\n\nAccording to Anthony Rose, executive chef and co-founder of Wilder and Rose restaurant group.\n\n\u201cPeameal-bacon sandwiches are the only thing served at Carousel Bakery (St. Lawrence Market, 93 Front St. E). Oh man, I love this shit \u2014 griddled and cured pork loin with cornmeal as the crust. The counterperson will say, \u2018Whatcha want?\u2019; you say, \u2018One sandwich, double meat.\u2019 That\u2019s it. Now dress said sandwich with pickled hot peppers, mayonnaise, and some yellow mustard. And just a few steps away are some awesome butter tarts and ridiculously good Nanaimo bars at Eve\u2019s Temptations.\u201d\n\n4. Want to Get a Torontonian Talking?\n\nBroach one of these pressing issues.\n\nBig Tech\u2019s Takeover\n\nCanada has courted highly skilled workers with fast-tracked visas since 2017, making it much easier for Silicon Valley staples like Uber, Amazon, and Google to set up shop in Toronto. According to a report by CBRE Group, Inc., the city\u2019s tech sector is now ranked right behind San Francisco\u2019s and Seattle\u2019s. While some are praising Toronto\u2019s position as a prime destination for engineers, others worry about its impact on homegrown businesses and housing costs.\n\nGun Violence\n\nToronto is on track to set a record for its highest number of shootings in a single year since 2004. A spike over the summer resulted in $4.5 million of government funding, an expanded task force on guns and gangs, and a growing debate over gun control. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mayor John Tory met about the issue last month but avoided backing a widespread handgun ban, which could become a point of contention in October\u2019s federal election.\n\nThe Opioid Crisis\n\nA rise in opioid-related overdoses has generated heated discussions over prevention strategies and action plans throughout Ontario. It has also earned Premier Doug Ford (the brother of former mayor Rob Ford) some harsh criticism over his decision to close several of Toronto\u2019s safe-injection sites.\n\n5. Where Locals Would Stay\n\nIf they weren\u2019t locals.\n\nGladstone Hotel (left) and The Broadview Hotel. Photo: THE AURA ROOM DESIGNED BY SARAH KEENLYSIDE; STUART MCLEOD. Gladstone Hotel (left) and The Broadview Hotel. Photo: THE AURA ROOM DESIGNED BY SARAH KEENLYSIDE; STUART MCLEOD.\n\n$\n\nGladstone Hotel\n\n1214 Queen St. W, from $189\n\n\u201cEach room is unique and designed by a Toronto artist. (There\u2019s the Blue Line Room and Surreal Gourmet Room.) The gallery space upstairs is always showcasing interesting contemporary work, and the bar hosts regular karaoke nights. It also has the coolest vintage elevator in Toronto.\u201d \u2014Evalyn Parry, artistic director of Buddies in Bad Times Theatre\n\n$$\n\nThe Broadview Hotel\n\n106 Broadview Ave., from $254\n\n\u201cThe rooms are comfortable in a familiar way: Natural organic toiletries from Graydon Skincare are a nice touch, and each room has vinyl collections from Tiny Record Shop. The rooftop bar has incredible views of the city and surprisingly comfortable barstools. The bar menu is perfect for sharing \u2014 the miso black cod is a standout.\u201d \u2014Sarra Tang, head designer and owner of Hoi Bo\n\n$$$\n\nThe Ritz-Carlton\n\n181 Wellington St. W, from $565\n\n\u201cEven if you\u2019ve stayed at other Ritz-Carltons, this one really gives you the feel of Canada: There are inlays of maple leafs in the lobby area, and the bar and restaurant menus have both leaned into local produce, meats, and seafood.\u201d \u2014Cameron Bailey, artistic director and co-head of the Toronto International Film Festival\n\n6. A Bloordale Crawl\n\nStephen Fowler, owner of used bookstore the Monkey\u2019s Paw, offers a tour through his neighborhood\u2019s main drag, where Toronto\u2019s past, present, and future coexist.\n\n1. Vena\u2019s Restaurant, 1263 Bloor St. W\n\n\u201cHole-in-the-wall source for West Indian curry and roti. Proclaims itself the \u2018Best Roti in Town\u2019 and may well be. I\u2019m a very loyal customer.\u201d\n\n2. Ransack the Universe, 1207 Bloor St. W\n\n\u201cA somewhat mad but completely diverting vintage shop packed with housewares, objects, and oddities.\u201d\n\n3. Wenona Craft Beer Lodge, 1269 Bloor St. W\n\n\u201cA pub with a rustic Canadiana theme and a formidable rotating list of Ontario microbrews on tap. Gets pretty raucous on trivia night.\u201d\n\n4. COO Caf\u00e9 Bread or Rice, 1049 Bloor St. W\n\n\u201cThis is a curious but very sweet mom-and-pop sit-down place serving modest Japanese-inspired comfort food. Almost impossible to describe, so I send everyone there to find out for themselves.\u201d\n\n5. Wise Bar, 1007 Bloor St. W\n\n\u201cA small, urbane bar with a nice patio out back. My current favorite for meeting up with friends.\u201d\n\n6. Kink Toronto, 975 Bloor St. W\n\n\u201cDiscreet and approachable sex toys and fetish gear, much of it handmade by local artisans.\u201d\n\n7. Siberia Vintage, 955 Bloor St. W\n\n\u201cDefinitely the coolest of several vintage-clothing shops on this strip.\u201d\n\n7. An Indie Rocker\u2019s Itinerary\n\nKevin Drew \u2014 co-founder of the record label Arts & Crafts and the iconic local rock band Broken Social Scene \u2014 picks out some key venues.\n\nThe Phoenix Concert Theatre. Photo: SUICIDALDOGS/INSTAGRAM\n\nFor Mid-Size Live Shows\n\nThe Phoenix Concert Theatre (410 Sherbourne St.)\n\n\u201cThis room can soar. The best show I saw here was actually Phoenix at the Phoenix when they were blowing up.\u201d\n\nFor New Bands and Saisons\n\nBurdock (1184 Bloor St. W)\n\n\u201cA place for musicians to try out tunes on a small stage. It serves its own beer, which is up there with the city\u2019s best DIY breweries.\u201d\n\nFor the Best Jukebox in Town\n\nCommunist\u2019s Daughter (1149 Dundas St. W)\n\n\u201cMichael Johnson hosts a great Monday vinyl night. You play the A side of an album, and then he asks if people want to hear the B side or choose a mystery album. A classic Toronto evening.\u201d\n\n8. And for the Hockey Fans \u2026\n\nSportscaster Andi Petrillo (CBC Sports, TSN, and CPL) offers a suggestion.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Vendor\n\n\u201cA lot of pubs are near one another. One of the biggest is Real Sports Bar & Grill (15 York St.). It\u2019s right by the Scotiabank Arena, where the Raptors and Maple Leafs play. They have TVs everywhere \u2014 even in the bathroom \u2014 so you won\u2019t miss a thing. Nearby is the Rec Room (255 Bremner St.), which is a kind of arcade for adults. They hold something called Puck Talks. They\u2019re intimate shoot-the-breeze sessions with former hockey players and insiders, usually about 30 minutes before the game starts.\u201d\n\n9. What to Take Back Home\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Vendor\n\nA custom six-pack from Left Field Brewery\n\nThis craft brewery (36 Wagstaff Dr.) specializes in hoppy and hazy IPAs but also dabbles in dynamic one-offs like a Mojito Sour.\n\nGender-neutral clothing from In Objects We Trust\n\nHead down a back alley for the showroom (1190 Queen St.) of this unisex brand known for bold pieces that wouldn\u2019t look out of place at Opening Ceremony.\n\nCheese-free Canadiana from Drake General Store\n\nThe Drake Hotel\u2019s gift shop (1150 Queen St. W) sells a popular line of onesies and milk-bag pins.\n\n10. Easy Escapes\n\nTurtles and nude beaches are all under an hour away.\n\nFor Kayaking and Bird-Watching\n\nThe Humber Marshes\n\nIn the city\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re one of the few remaining river-mouth marshes in Toronto, and they provide a breeding habitat for ducks, turtles, and fish \u2014 60 species live there. We are the closest store to the river, so I\u2019d say come to us, where you can rent kayaks or tandem canoes. I\u2019d start paddling near Sir Casimir Gzowski Park (2001 Lake Shore Blvd. W), then go north up to Etienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9 Park and back.\u201d \u2014Kelly McDowell, president of the Complete Paddler\n\nPhoto: Unsplash\n\nFor Clothing-Optional Beaches\n\nToronto Islands\n\n15 minutes by ferry\n\n\u201cThey are so close, and once you get there, it\u2019s like you\u2019re in another world \u2014 this pastoral landscape with an incredible panoramic view of the city. Centre Island is the most popular, and Hanlan\u2019s Point is famous for its nude beach, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re in the mood for.\u201d \u2014Cameron Bailey\n\nPhoto: Unsplash\n\nFor Waterfalls and Hiking Trails\n\nHamilton\n\n45 minutes by car\n\n\u201cHamilton is known as the city of waterfalls. I\u2019d start by grabbing a morning coffee and snack at Synonym (328 James St. N). I like going to Devil\u2019s Punchbowl in the winter; it becomes an icy cliff then, and you can walk inside it. Tew Falls and Sherman Falls are both beautiful spots to explore in warmer months.\u201d \u2014Juli Daoust Baker, co-owner of Mj\u00f6lk\n\n*A version of this article appears in the September 2, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
