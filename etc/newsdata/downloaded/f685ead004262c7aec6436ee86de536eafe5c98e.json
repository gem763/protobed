(Yahoo Finance)\n\nBERLIN - On a sunny September morning I set a timer and began walking the streets of Berlin with a mission: to count every single \u201cmobility\u201d company possible. An hour later I had counted over a dozen bike and scooter-sharing services. A visitor to the city can\u2019t help but notice something is different in Berlin, where wheeled devices of all shapes, colors, and sizes scatter the streets more than your average city.\n\nBerlin is far more advanced than cities like San Francisco, London, and New York when it comes to getting from A to B. The city\u2019s sidewalks have turned into a veritable menu of transportation options, and the fact that it marries the useful parts of the modern world (apps and sharing) with older transportation forms like the bicycle and scooter makes it appear thoughtful.\n\nWhile everything in the crowded mobility landscape feels somewhat impermanent and new, it also feels strangely post-Uber. The winner-take all attitude for personal mobility pioneered by Travis Kalanick has been replaced by a pluralistic transportation environment.\n\nMaybe too pluralistic. Since kick scooters got permission to launch in Berlin in early summer, Voi, Tier, Lime, Bird, Circ, Hive, and Jump have descended on the town, joining bicycle sharing services Donkey Republic, Moobike, Lidl-Bike, Jump Bike, and Deezer. For Vespa-style roller scooters, there are Emmy and Coup. For quick, one-way car rental there\u2019s Sixt, DriveNow, Miles, Car2Go, and Flinkster. For Uber-like taxi services there are Uber, BerlK\u00f6nig, Via, and CleverShuttle. And don\u2019t forget the U-bahn (subway), S-bahn (commuter rail), Tram (streetcar), and bus.\n\nTier, Lime, Donkey, MooBike, Jump by Uber litter a Berlin sidewalk. (Yahoo Finance) More\n\nThough Berlin has a few key characteristics that make it more open to mobility innovation, the city also illustrates how changes in transportation and mobility can happen \u2014 and how companies like Uber can have serious competition from unlikely places.\n\nHow many transportation apps can you have on your phone?\n\nThe absence of a winner-take-all environment is most evident if you look at a Berliner\u2019s phone. One media consultant and former journalist showed me his phone. It had not one, two, or three, but four pages of various transportation apps \u2014 many of which see regular use. There\u2019s two reasons for this madness, he told me. First of all, it might take a few apps until you find something near you available, as few of these companies have enough density to blanket the city with options \u2014 the recipe for transportation monogamy.\n\nTwo pages of apps from a Berliner's phone. There are four pages. (Yahoo Finance) More\n\nThe other reason is price. Every time a new competitor enters the market, it undercuts the others and pushes down prices. For one-way car rentals, alternatives to taxis where you just unlock a car with your phone and drive yourself to your destination, the situation is especially in the consumers\u2019 favor. Though kick-scooter startups like Lime, Voi, and Tier are funded by venture capital, the car options come from BMW, Daimler, and VW. Unlike the startups, these companies have so much money that they can afford to price low in search of market share.\n\nVW, which recently entered the market with WeShare, has jaw-dropping prices of 0.19\u20ac/km ($0.35/mi) its electric Golf cars, about half that of its competitors. \u201cThe German car companies are s***ing themselves,\u201d the consultant told me, explaining that the desperate prices come from legacy car companies trying to diversify their business model for a future in which people don\u2019t buy cars in the same way as today. For sober Berliners with licenses, these car options are viable alternatives to a taxi or an Uber, given the ease and the cost. A trip across town that might run 20\u20ac or more is knocked down to 5\u20ac, if you\u2019re willing to drive yourself.", "description": "In Berlin, companies like Uber don't have a dominant hold on transportation.
