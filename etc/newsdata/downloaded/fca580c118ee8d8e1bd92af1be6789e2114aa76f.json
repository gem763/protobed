And that love has also shed light on her relationship with her own mom who was a single mother at just 19.\n\n\"To watch my mother care for my son and care for me -- she's always been my best friend -- but I didn't know I could love her so much as a woman,\" Hall said. \"I started crying watching my mom hold my son -- it's powerful.\"\n\nAs for her other new role as a daytime talk show host, Hall said her goal is to bring experiences and conversations to an all inclusive table.\n\nThe New Promo!!!!

So we want to take you on this journey and talk about it, whatever it is.\"\n\nTroy Harvey/ABC via Getty Images\n\nShe continued, \"We want to talk to people and meet people where they are, I say I want to set a table and you can come to my table with any kind of chair you have. A high chair, barcalounger -- a lawn chair -- whatever you got. I want you to feel included.\"\n\nHall said her favorite part of the show has been the team of people behind the scenes.\n\n\"Team means the world to me, I have a phenomenal team,\" she said of the producers and staff who \"came on board\" and took a leap of faith with her. \"We all believe in each other and we have each other's backs. Let me keep it real, I miss people too, I miss that connection.\"\n\n\"Tamron Hall\" debuts Sept. 9 and is distributed in national syndication by Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International.\n\nWalt Disney is the parent company of ABC News.", "description": "Tamron Hall opens up about motherhood, advice from others and the inclusivity and conversations that will be discussed on her new talk show.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/tamron-hall-gty-ml-190906_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
