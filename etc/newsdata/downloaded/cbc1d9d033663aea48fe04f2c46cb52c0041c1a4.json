CNBC was invited to take a look before it officially reopens \u2014 here's a tour of what it looks like inside.\n\nThe flagship store in New York has been closed for renovations since January 2017 but reemerged with a colorful (though temporary) rainbow glass covering earlier this month. It first opened in 2006 and was renovated in 2011.\n\nCustomers enter through the glass cube, steps away from New York's Central Park, and take either an elevator or stairs down to an underground store. Apple said it worked with its architect to \"reimagine the plaza\" to \"remove the boundaries from Fifth Avenue.\" Apple added 18 \"sky lenses\" and \"62 sky lights\" to bring light down into the store. There are also two new entrances, to the north and to the south of the cube.\n\nFriday's reopening coincides with the launch of Apple's new iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. The location will be open 24 hours a day.", "description": "Here's a look inside Apple's flagship Fifth Avenue store, known as the \"cube,\" in New York.
