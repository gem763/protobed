The road had since reopened, Bezuidenhout said.\n\nOn the N2 out-bound at Raapenberg Road, tow trucks had removed taxis, she added. At 14:45, the road was reopened.\n\nTyres were also set alight in the left lane of the N2 out-bound at Bhunga Avenue.\n\nThe N2 on Friday afternoon. (Supplied: Maxine Bezuidenhout)\n\nBezuidenhout was unable to say if the unrest was related to Tuesday's action in which taxi drivers protested over the issuing of warrants during afternoon traffic, blocking roads.\n\nCommuters had been threatened and violently forced out of minibuses, News24 reported.\n\nThe action was condemned by the mayoral committee member for safety and security, JP Smith, who slammed the \"violent reaction to the rule of law\", in which a police officer was assaulted and robbed of his firearm.\n\nThe unrest was believed to have been related to the issuing of warrants and impounding of illegal taxis during an operation on Tuesday, the fact that they were fined in the first place, and the fine amount, Smith said at the time.\n\nFines, he pointed out, were set by the provincial government.\n\nPolice all over near the Cape Town taxi rank.
