There's been a bunch of promising leaks, some of which have already turned out to be true, so let's round them all up to see what's most likely in store for Pixel fans.\n\nReport: The 'Fanta' Pixel 4 Is Definitely Happening Last week, we reported that Google's Pixel 4 was rumoured to be coming in a bold new colour scheme. We now have a name for the Fanta-esque finish and it's very fitting.

It's also expected to come in a white finish too.\n\nWell, since there seems to be some interest, here you go! Wait 'til you see what it can do. #Pixel4 pic.twitter.com/RnpTNZXEI1 \u2014 Made by Google (@madebygoogle) June 12, 2019\n\nGoogle has already confirmed the first two colours after it released images of the device's rear twice before its reveal, so we know for sure the leaks are actually accurate.\n\nAs for the front display, leaks indicate it'll come with a slim notch where the selfie camera will be housed instead of opting for the hole-punch camera.\n\nWhat's under the hood?\n\nNaturally, none of the specs leaks have been confirmed by Google but from them we can gather the Pixel 4 might come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chip, 6GB of RAM and either 64GB or 128GB of storage, depending on the model you choose.\n\nThe regular model is set to have a 5.7-inch display while the XL is due to have 6.3-inch. Both will reportedly come with OLED.\n\nImage: YouTube\n\nThe great thing is, there doesn't seem to be a big difference between the regular Pixel and XL model other than display and battery size. If this turns out to be true, it marks a move away from the trend of upgrading the bigger model with all the best and juiciest features.\n\nHere's a specs dump based on the rumours.\n\nRumoured Specs Pixel 4 Pixel 4 XL RAM 6 GB 6 GB Display 5.7-inch OLED with Full HD+, 90Hz 6.3-inch OLED with Quad HD+, 90Hz CPU Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chip Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chip Storage/Memory 64/128 GB 64/128 GB Battery 2800 mAh 3700 mAh Camera 12MP with phase-detect auto-focus, 16MP telephoto lens 12MP with phase-detect auto-focus, 16MP telephoto lens\n\nHow can I watch its release?\n\nGoogle will be live-streaming the Pixel 4 announcement from its New York event on 15 October at 10am.
