And that\u2019s all I can say. It lodged with me as a child, this story or this fragment, and obviously I\u2019ve enlarged it and changed it significantly. But it has that at its core.\u201d\n\nThe first trailer for 1917 was released last week.\n\nSet in the trenches of the First World War, the film follows a young soldier's attempt to call off an attack and save the life of his brother in another battalion.\n\nIt features a starry ensemble cast including Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Andrew Scott, Mark Strong and Bodyguard's Richard Madden.", "description": "Sam Mendes has revealed that his grandfather was the inspiration behind him writing his first-ever screenplay.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/S66oIexCtI4/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-01"}
