While Booker\u2019s now sponsoring a federal gun licensing bill that also includes a de facto gun registry and Beto O\u2019Rourke says he\u2019s coming for your AR-15\u2019s, it\u2019s actually New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern who made the comment as she called for more gun control laws in New Zealand on the six month anniversary of the attack in Christchurch that killed 51 people.\n\n\u201cOwning a firearm is a privilege not a right,\u201d Ardern said in a statement announcing the new bill on Friday. \u201cThat attack exposed weaknesses in legislation which we have the power to fix. We would not be a responsible government if we didn\u2019t address them,\u201d she said. The new bill, details of which have already been made public and that will have its first reading on Sept. 24, will include the creation of a registry to monitor and track every firearm legally held in New Zealand. It also tightens other rules for gun dealers and for individuals to get and keep a firearm license. License renewal for individuals was also reduced to five years from ten years.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Ardern says she can push these bills because owning a gun is a privilege, not a right. Yet Democrats like Beto O\u2019Rourke and Cory Booker are telling us, yes, you have the right to keep and bear arms, while they push American versions of Ardern\u2019s gun ban/compensated confiscation and now her proposed gun registry/licensing scheme. They\u2019re paying lip service to the idea of a right to keep and bear arms, while offering up plans that ignore the right entirely.\n\nWe all know Beto, Booker, and the other eight candidates on stage last night don\u2019t think the right to keep and bear arms is a real right. If you asked those assembled on stage last night if the Supreme Court made the correct decision in Heller to strike down Washington, D.C.\u2019s ban on handguns on the grounds that the 2nd Amendment protects the individual right to keep and bear arms, I doubt a single person would have said \u201cyes\u201d. They don\u2019t think it\u2019s a real right, they don\u2019t treat it like it\u2019s a real right, but they claim they support the right, even while saying this:\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nWhen \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\u201d meets \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47\u201d, it\u2019s time to drop the charade that you support the 2nd Amendment in any way. As I\u2019ve argued before, I really think he should demand a full repeal of the 2nd Amendment.\n\nBeto\u2019s already calling for gun laws that would curtail the ability of some legal gun owners to exercise their 2nd Amendment rights through gun licensing and gun bans. Why not go all in and announce he wants to end legal gun ownership altogether? If, in his opinion, there\u2019s no reason to own the most popular long gun in the United States today, does he have a good reason why Americans should be able to own a handgun that\u2019s easily concealable and used in far more crimes than an AR-15? If he\u2019s going to propose ineffectual gun control solutions to these active assailant attacks, why not go big and demand and just demand an end to the right to keep and bear arms altogether?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t ever vote for that, obviously, but I could at least respect the honesty in that position. And who knows, if Beto doesn\u2019t see a bounce after last night\u2019s debate, he might become desperate enough to say \u201cf*** it\u201d (as he increasingly does) and go full repeal in the hopes of capturing the hearts and minds of the anti-gun movement. In the meantime, however, Beto and the others will continue to treat the 2nd Amendment like a non-entity, while continuing to proclaim they support it.", "description": "Here's a little quiz for you: Which candidate at last night's Democrat presidential debate said \"\u201cOwning a firearm is a privilege not a right\"?", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/587e93a3-a028-400f-bbc0-d33887cfe1ad.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
