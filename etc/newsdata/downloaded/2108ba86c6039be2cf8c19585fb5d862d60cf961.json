Nothing wrong with it.\n\nNicole (left) ordered her daughter Nicole (right) pay \u00a31,600 for a replacement queen size bed, after a night of 'intense passion' while she was away caused the bed to break\n\n'When we returned the house was a mess, and when I went upstairs to my bedroom, I discovered that my bed was broken.'\n\nNicole told radio host Kyle Sandilands, 48, who has no legal background, but is assisted by a legal expert: 'I felt very violated by the fact that she broke it and didn't actually care that she broke it.'\n\nRhiannon was shown photos of a broken bed on the show and admitted that she and a male companion had broken the bed, citing the cause as some 'intense passion.'\n\n'Darl, that's the least romantic place!' Kyle Sandilands (pictured), 48, gave his verdict on the new Australian TV show\n\n'On mum's bed? Darl, that's the least romantic place I could imagine being with someone, on mum's bed,' Kyle said. When asked why she didn't use the different bed, Rhiannon said her friends were sleeping in it.\n\nRhiannon told Kyle she couldn't afford the AU$2,099 her mother wanted for a new bed. Nicole refuted that argument, replying 'bulls**t!'\n\nThe TV judge ruled in the mother's favour after hearing she is getting married in a matter of weeks with Rhiannon as her bridesmaid.\n\nFurious Rhiannon was shown photos of the broken bed on the show (pictured) as Kyle ruled in favour of mum, Nicole\n\n'Rhiannon, really, you're responsible for breaking your mother's bed, so the ruling is $2099 so your mum can consummate her future relationship in her own bed,' Kyle said.\n\nRhiannon responded outside the courtroom complaining about her mother's own bedroom antics.\n\n'My mum most definitely contributed to the breaking of that bed,' she said.", "description": "Mum Nicole sought justice  on new Australian TV show Trial By Kyle.
