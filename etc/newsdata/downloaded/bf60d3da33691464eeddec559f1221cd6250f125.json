Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) broke from her radical colleagues during the Ohio debate Tuesday night by stating abortion should be \u201csafe, legal, and rare,\u201d and indicating she would, if elected president, work to restrict most abortions in the third trimester of pregnancy.\n\nCNN debate host Erin Burnett asked the candidates how, as president, they would block states whose elected representatives vote to ban or restrict abortion.\n\n\u201cThis is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make, and it\u2019s unfortunate to see how in this country it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon,\u201d Gabbard responded, and continued:\n\nI agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, I think she\u2019s correct. We see how the consequences of laws that you\u2019re referring to can often lead to a dangerous place, as we\u2019ve seen them as they\u2019re passed in other countries, where a woman who has a miscarriage past that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point. I do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that, during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.\n\nOn Saturday, the New York Times published a piece attacking Gabbard in advance of the debate as a right-wing extremist with \u201csuspicious activity\u201d around her campaign.\n\nBreitbart News reported:\n\nThe Times article, \u201cWhat, Exactly, Is Tulsi Gabbard Up To?,\u201d claims that Gabbard is beloved by white nationalists, antisemites, and Russians attempting to interfere in the election, citing \u201csuspicious activity\u201d around her campaign.\n\nWhile Gabbard has broken from her fellow Democrat candidates in stating restrictions should be placed on abortion, she is not up to date on Hillary Clinton\u2019s most current views on the issue if she is using the failed candidate as a reference point.\n\nBoth Bill and Hillary Clinton said over 25 years ago that abortion is a \u201cfundamental constitutional right\u201d and should be \u201csafe, legal, and rare.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Clinton repeated she wanted abortion, \u201csafe, legal and rare, and by rare, I mean rare,\u201d as the pro-life LifeNews reported.\n\nEight years later, however, when Clinton was running for president \u2014 and received the endorsement of Planned Parenthood \u2014 she clearly said unborn babies have no constitutional right to life, even up until their due date.\n\nIn April, Clinton responded to The View co-host Paula Faris when asked about her comments that an unborn child has no constitutional rights:\n\nUnder our law that is the case, Paula. I support Roe versus Wade because I think it is an important \u2014 an important statement about the importance of a woman making this most difficult decision with consultation by whom she chooses: her doctor, her faith, her family. And under the law and under certainly that decision, that is the way we structure it.\n\nAfter losing the 2016 presidential election to Donald Trump, Clinton wrote in her book What Happened that pro-life Democrats must vote against their principles and in favor of legislation that promotes abortion rights.\n\n\u201cBut when personal views on abortion become public actions \u2014 votes on legislation or judges or funding that erode women\u2019s rights \u2014 that\u2019s a different matter,\u201d Clinton wrote about whether views on abortion should be a litmus test for Democrat Party candidates. \u201cWe have to remain a big tent, but a big tent is only as strong as the poles that hold it up.\u201d\n\nIn January, Clinton joined New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to push for a state measure \u2014 which he ultimately signed into law \u2014 that would permit abortions \u201cat any time\u201d a patient\u2019s health needs to be protected.\n\nPro-life activists and medical providers noted that allowing abortion \u201cat any time\u201d a patient\u2019s \u201chealth\u201d needs to be protected is purposefully vague.", "description": "Tulsi Gabbard broke from her radical colleagues by stating she would work to restrict most abortions in the third trimester of pregnancy.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Tulsi-Gabbard-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
