Mr. Caiazzo, who was Mr. Sanders\u2019s political director in Massachusetts and Rhode Island during the 2016 campaign , has been named state director in Massachusetts.\n\nThe moves were announced to the campaign\u2019s New Hampshire staff on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe feel really good about where we stand in New Hampshire right now,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, the Sanders campaign manager. \u201cThe poll numbers, the volunteer capacity, the crowds that we have been getting at these events all suggest to us that we are in a very good position.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cObviously, much work to do to continue that trend.\u201d\n\nThe Sanders campaign also recently shook up its top leadership, promoting both Ari Rabin-Havt, the chief of staff, and Arianna Jones, the communications director, to the position of deputy campaign manager and bringing on a new senior communications adviser.", "description": "Mr. Sanders has overhauled his New Hampshire state operations, as his campaign fights to maintain support in a state he won by more than 22 percentage points in 2016.", "authors": ["Sydney Ember", "Jonathan Martin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/us/politics/15sanders-nh/15sanders-nh-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
