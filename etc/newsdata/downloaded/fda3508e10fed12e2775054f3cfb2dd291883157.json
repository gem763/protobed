There are progressives who believe that racism, nativism, and misogyny powered Donald Trump\u2019s rise and must be defeated. There are conservatives who believe that Trump\u2019s election was a response to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d\u2014the left\u2019s effort to demonize as bigoted anyone who defends the traditions that made America great. And there\u2019s a third group that thinks it\u2019s all a dangerous distraction, a fight over where to place the chaise longues on the Titanic. What\u2019s killing America, this camp argues, is bad economics; treat that and the identity hatreds will fade. Over the past quarter century, two presidential candidates have mobilized these economics-first, culture-war-indifferent voters into a potent force. The first was Ross Perot. The second is Andrew Yang\u2026\n\nIn 1992, Perot won 19 percent of the vote, the highest for any third-party candidate since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. Perot\u2019s supporters were disproportionately young, white, male, and secular. On culture-war issues, according to a study by FiveThirtyEight, they were all over the map: pro-choice, pro\u2013death penalty, anti\u2013gun control, and anti\u2013affirmative action. What distinguished them was the intensity of their views about \u201ceconomic nationalism, reform, and the budget.\u201d\n\nAlmost three decades later, Yang is assembling a similar coalition with an updated version of Perot\u2019s message. For the Texas billionaire, the root cause of America\u2019s ills was debt. For Yang, it\u2019s robots. \u201cThe reason Donald Trump was elected was that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,\u201d Yang told The New York Times last year. \u201cIf you look at the voter data, it shows that the higher the level of concentration of manufacturing robots in a district, the more that district voted for Trump.\u201d For Yang, Trump is only the first big calamity that automation will bring. In the coming years, self-driving cars will replace truckers, then similar technology will dispense with \u201cretail workers, call-center workers, fast-food workers, insurance companies, accounting firms.\u201d In The War on Normal People, Yang predicts riots, if not revolution. \u201cWe have five to 10 years before truckers lose their jobs,\u201d he told the Times, \u201cand [then] all hell breaks loose.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Peter Beinart", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Andrew-Yang-Consummate-Outsider"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
