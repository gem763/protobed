He will look to continue his assent in the lightweight rankings when he takes on Dober.\n\nMeanwhile, training out of Elevation Fight Team, Dober is coming off a first-round finish over Marco Polo Reyes at June\u2019s UFC on ESPN 3, and has won four of his last five fights.", "description": "A pair of lightweights are headed to a Jan. 18 UFC event, though promotion officials have yet to formally announce the card.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Blue Corner", "Simon Head", "Matt Erickson", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan", "John Morgan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/nasrat-haqparast-joaquim-silva-ufc-on-espn-5-9.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
