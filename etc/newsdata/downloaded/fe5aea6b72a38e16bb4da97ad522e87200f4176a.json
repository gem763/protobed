Dubbed CommonHealth, the service will go live in January 2020, using UCSF as the launching pad for a pilot. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nHere's what it means: The aim of CommonHealth is to kick medical research up a notch with a larger sum of patient health data \u2014 but it could come up against some privacy concerns.\n\nCommonHealth is on the hunt for medical research partners that want to unlock access to the stockpile of collected data. The goal is to make it easier for patients to share health record information among health apps and healthcare entities \u2014 and those leading the venture say future partners can tap into the data to improve diagnostics, medical research, and digital therapeutics development. CommonHealth is in good shape to attract research-focused health systems: The initiative should rope in a significant amount of data from consumers using Android-enabled smartphones given that Android had a hold on 44% of the mobile operating system market in the US last month, per Statcounter. And we've seen major interest in services like these already: Apple's electronic health record (EHR) platform has hooked in over 300 US provider firms, for example.\n\nBut the initiative will need to contend with mounting privacy concerns about accessing sensitive health information via smartphones. Powerful organizations like the American Medical Association have voiced concerns about services resembling CommonHealth because federal privacy rules that protect patient data from being misused by healthcare stakeholders don't apply when sensitive data is ferried to consumer apps, according to the New York Times. Being transparent about how patient data will be handled will be paramount to win favor from patients and partners that want to avoid any scandals: Health systems interested in unlocking access to CommonHealth can apply \u2014 but the joint venture has set up a \"robust governance process\" to vet potential partners and apps.\n\nThe bigger picture: The smartphone is becoming a health hub \u2014 and the ubiquitous tool could be a panacea to some of healthcare's interoperability woes.\n\nTapping a platform capable of collecting, aggregating, and sharing patient data from a range of sources could bring the industry closer to faster and easier health data exchange, which has been slow to take off. Only 20% of health systems use EHR data from outside sources, for example.\n\nBut ensuring that they're able to access EHR data from across sources will become more important since patients are increasingly moving between healthcare services to find satisfactory care \u2014 which could land healthcare organizations that cite trouble sharing data with one another with mismatched or incomplete records.\n\nIncomplete health records could have healthcare stakeholders wasting time and cash on treatments and tests that patients don't need \u2014 an issue the US pours $200 billion into annually. Considering 81% of people in the US own a smartphone, it can serve as a smart entry point into a larger pool of patient data.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
