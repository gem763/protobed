In a polite way, ask him or her for their name. I would respect what they are doing so that you don\u2019t get shot in the back of the head.'\n\nSanders went on to say, 'But I would also be very mindful of the fact that as a nation, we have got to hold police officers accountable for the actions that they commit.'\n\nHe then rounded out his answer by saying that, 'I would be very cautious, if you were my son, in terms of dealing with that police officer, but I would also defend my rights and know my rights and make sure, if possible, that police officer\u2019s camera is on.'\n\nSanders' response was met with seemingly lackluster applause from the audience - in stark contrast to the answer that fellow candidate Joe Biden gave when asked the same question.\n\nSanders (on October 27) also said that he would advice knowing your right and making sure that the police officer's bodycam is turned on\n\nDuring Biden's time on stage, a black female student asked him for his advice the next time she was pulled over by a police officer.\n\nIn the video clip, which was shared by Biden's Twitter account, the former Vice President immediately responded: 'If you were my daughter, you'd be a Caucasian girl and you wouldn't be pulled over.'\n\nAs laughter and applause breaks out, Biden says, 'No. No! But here's the deal. What I'd tell you is that's what's wrong. That is what's wrong. There is institutional racism that still exists.'\n\nIn response to Sanders' encouragement to respect police officers to avoid getting shot in the back of the head, Morehouse College adjunct professor David Dennis Jr. wrote, in a since deleted tweet, 'Bernie Sanders does not understand race in America. At. All.'", "description": "The Democratic presidential candidate's surprising answer came during a Q&A session at Saturday's Second Step Presidential Justice Forum event at Benedict College in South Carolina.", "authors": ["Maxine Shen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/00/20261004-0-image-a-57_1572221821553.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
