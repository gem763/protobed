Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Perino said Wednesday on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\"\n\nHost Tucker Carlson asked whether Perino believed Biden's campaign was \"evaporating\" as he commits repeated gaffes on the campaign trail.\n\nBIDEN CAMPAIGN DOWNPLAYS EXPECTATIONS IN BOTH IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n\"It's almost like you can sense it,\" she said. \"Everyone is kind of politely saying that's not true.

John Kerry, D-Mass., then-Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., and Hillary Clinton all winning both the Hawkeye State's caucus and the party nod.\n\nPerino added it would be \"fascinating\" to watch whether Warren and Sanders -- both progressives -- will team up against the more moderate Biden.", "description": "Former Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden's\u00a02020 presidential campaign continues to chug along with the candidate leading in national polls, despite reports of lowered expectations in Iowa and New Hampshire, according to Fox News' Dana Perino.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Perino-Biden_FOX-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
