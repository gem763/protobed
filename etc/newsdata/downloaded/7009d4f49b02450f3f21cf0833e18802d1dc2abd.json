MUST WATCH\n\nRoyal patronage\n\nNow in its ninth year, British Champions Day -- the culmination of the 35-race British Champions Series -- has become a well-established part of the racing calendar. It attracts Europe's top horses, riders and owners, including Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, a racehorse owner herself and an avid racing fan.\n\nThe John-Gosden-trained Stradivarius has been one of the standout horses of recent seasons but his defeat by a nose to Kew Gardens in the two-mile Long Distance Cup passes the baton, even if it deprives some of the fairy tale finish they crave.\n\nBringing together another popular thread, the Aidan O'Brien-trained Magical, three times a runner-up to double Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe heroine Enable and fifth this year, clinched her most lucrative title yet with victory in the Champion Stakes.\n\n\"You don't necessarily want the same horses winning all the time, you want excitement, and that's sport,\" Simon Bazalgette, the recently departed group chief executive officer of the Jockey Club, told CNN Sport.\n\nPhotos: Royal Ascot 2019: The most impressive hats on show Scroll through to see some of the most impressive hats on show at Royal Ascot 2019 in June.

So we looked at how that could be created, and on the back of that, we created British Champions Day.\"\n\nThe creation of the British Champions Series, which consists of some of the sport's biggest races, including the 2,000 Guineas, The Derby, Royal Ascot and Glorious Goodwood, wasn't without controversy.\n\n\"In 2011, it was a break in tradition,\" Street said. \"This is an amalgamation of races from other racecourses. Because racing is quite traditional, there was quite a lot of push-back, and a lot of people who said, 'It can't done,' or, 'It shouldn't be done.' But we've got to a place now where the industry is really behind it, we've shown we can create a special occasion.\"\n\nPhotos: Royal Ascot fashion throughout the ages The fashions at Royal Ascot have changed tremendously since the race was founded in 1711.
