I have to admit it does have a better ring to it. Certainly one can imagine Powell pacing the FOMC theatre up and down proverbially speaking, as he gets ready to present at the October FOMC meeting at the end of October. Given the repo market being in a state of extreme stress over the past few weeks, a lot of the sell-side research houses are now contemplating the need for, dare I say it, QE4 (Quantitative Easing Level 4). Saying the word QE out loud can be a taboo these days, but if well disguised under the mask of \"open market operations\", it can serve the same purpose and keep the Fed in the clear. Especially after a decade-long worth of QE with little growth to show for it, one wonders the merits of it after all, certainly questionable with the S&P 500 trading close to all-time highs.\n\nThe repo market crisis started a few weeks ago when overnight loan rates between banks shot as high as 10%. Clearly there was stress in the system as it implied some bank or banks were underfunded. The Fed did react to the sudden rise in rates by injecting about $275 billion in liquidity in overnight operations the week prior, and more was scheduled last week. In the last two weeks about $600 billion worth of liquidity has been demanded by the various banks, on most days demand outpacing supply, showing extreme stress in the system. The last two days when the Fed increased the daily cap to $100 billion, only $50 billion and $30 billion were demanded, suggesting the market had cooled down a bit. Whether it was a one-off quarter end phenomenon or a severe liquidity crisis, the jury is out. The next week or so should help investors gauge a better perspective if there are still unmet overnight subscriptions to the Fed's injections. It would imply a much larger problem at hand.\n\nWhat is perhaps even more worrying is that the $1.4 trillion dollar worth of \"excess\" reserves is still too low for the overall U.S. financial system. There are suggestions that the Fed may need to embark on Permanent Open Market Operations (POMO) allowing the Fed to start expanding its balance sheet once again. After decade-long balance sheet expansion starting in 2009, the Fed only stopped the rolling back of its balance sheet reduction program this year in March 2019. At the peak in 2015/2016, the balance sheet size was $4.25 trillion. It only got down to as low as $3.5 trillion, and now there is talk of it expanding it yet again?\n\nRecession risk has risen. Other than focusing too much on the shape of the inverted yield curve, there are various other metrics that support a slowdown is in effect: Global PMI's, global profits peaking, unsustainable debt bubble and uncertainty on U.S./China Trade Wars that have disastrously effected global freight volumes and disrupted supply chains. It is clear that the cost of increased tariffs on Chinese imported goods is now being borne by the U.S. companies, contrary to what President Trump keeps tweeting. This can be seen in the Core Consumer Price data in the U.S. as it ticks higher as slowly U.S. companies pass along increased costs to the average consumer. China, on the other hand, can just let the Yuan drop to offset against these tariffs increases, and maintain their export cost advantage.\n\nOctober is filled with uncertainty and on Friday markets fell on talk of the U.S. limiting portfolio flows into China and/or banning Chinese listed companies from trading on the U.S. exchange. Certainly not a good start for trade talks that start on October 10th. Not to mention we have the Brexit October 31st deadline to deal with as well. It is impossible to gauge what the outcome of that will be given UK politics is so chaotic.\n\nBuybacks have been a big support to the U.S. market and blackout period starts soon as companies will not be able to buy back their stock prior to Q3'19 earnings release. It remains to be seen whether the Fed can once again save the day with more quantitative easing. But perhaps they will wait till the market properly corrects before doing so.
