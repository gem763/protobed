It is clear the trend with most of the major U.S. data points are trending lower and it seems slowdown concerns have been confirmed. The doom and gloom that started with manufacturing appears to be starting to show signs of creeping into the service sector. The ISM report triggered a new wave of risk aversion with both U.S. stocks and the American dollar extending their declines on the week.\n\nWhile the service sector is still adding jobs, it is very apparent that we are no longer adding jobs at a strong pace and we will likely see further weakness in the service sector have a strong ripple effect in the coming months.\n\nWith slowdown expectations firmly in place many will expect the Fed to respond with an easing cycle to stop the growing risks of a recession. A rate cut won\u2019t be enough, with the QE debate will likely begin in the coming meetings. Fed Fund Futures odds for an October rate cut jumped from 72% to 87.3%. The market is now pricing in just over 40 basis points in rate cuts for the remainder of the year, implying we could see a string of cuts in October and December.\n\nMarkets will now closely await comments from Fed vice-chairman Richard Clarida later this evening and Fed chair Jerome Powell at the Fed Listens Event tomorrow afternoon. If we see Clarida or Powell start to show capitulation signs that an easing cycle is upon us, we could see the dollar extend its declines.\n\nGold\n\nprices surged off the disappointing ISM service sector release, but has started to pare back its gains. Gold will need a disappointing nonfarm payroll headline number to take out last week\u2019s high of around $1,540 an ounce.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes only.
