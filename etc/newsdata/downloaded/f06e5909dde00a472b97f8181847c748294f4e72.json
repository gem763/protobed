That put it on track for the biggest one-day decline since it went public in May 1998. The previous record one-day selloff was 19.5% on Oct. 2, 2000.\n\nDorel\u2019s annual dividend rate was a relatively high 60 cents a share, which based on Monday\u2019s stock closing price of $6.80 for the U.S.-listed shares, implied a dividend yield of 8.82%. That compares with the implied yield for the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.23% of 1.99%, according to FactSet.\n\n\u201cIt is prudent to suspend the dividend until the chaotic market conditions created by tariffs are normalized,\u201d said Chief Executive Martin Schwartz.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nWhat may have also spooked investors, is that Dorel said it amended its revolving credit facilities and term loan, to \u201cfacilitate compliance\u201d with its financial covenants under facilities.\n\nDealing with tariffs had \u2018several negative consequences\u2019\n\nDorel said the second round of tariffs on Chinese imports announced in May, which raised the tariffs on bicycles, furniture and other sourced goods to 25%, had a \u201cmuch greater impact\u201d on its business than the original 10% tariff.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: China\u2019s trade with U.S. tumbles as tariff war escalates.\n\nAlso read: U.S. wants to make progress in solving China trade dispute: Mnuchin.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nThe company raised prices on its products midway through the third quarter in an effort to mitigate the financial impact, but that had \u201cseveral negative consequences\u201d on its businesses:\n\n\u2022 Not all competitors or retailers raised prices at the same time, which disrupted the retail marketplace.\n\n\u2022 Retailers changed their buying routines from suppliers.\n\n\u2022 New price points caused some consumers to opt for different items, creating a \u201cconsiderable\u201d product mix imbalance.\n\n\u2022 Elevated warehousing costs are being incurred, as the shift in demand has delayed the company\u2019s inventory balancing program.\n\n\u2022 Large U.S. customers have delayed Christmas 2019 deliveries to the beginning of the fourth quarter.\n\n\u2022 Gross margins in its mass merchant business have fallen, as although sales remained strong, the sales mix has been negative.\n\n\u201cThe net result of these challenges is that Dorel Home\u2019s expected gross margin improvement from first-half levels will be delayed to the beginning of 2020,\u201d Schwartz said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all about tariffs and trade, however. Dorel said the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies hurt its sports and juvenile segments. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index slipped 0.2% on Tuesday, after closing Monday at the highest level since May 2017.\n\nDollar strength can help reduce costs of imports, but it can also make U.S. products more expensive to overseas customers. Dorel said the financial results of the businesses affected by dollar strength fell between 3% and 8%.", "description": "Shares of Schwinn-parent Dorel Industries Inc. were suffering a record plunge Tuesday after the company said it would stop paying its relatively high...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS417_Schwin_ZG_20191001125832.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
