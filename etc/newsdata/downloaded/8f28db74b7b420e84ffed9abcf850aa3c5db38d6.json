So to get out of here with a split is awesome.\u201d\n\nThe Dodgers are trying to get back to the World Series for a third straight year, after falling in the championship showpiece to the Houston Astros in 2017 and the Boston Red Sox last year.\n\nStarter Stephen Strasburg, who was pitching on the shortest rest of his career, also shone by taking a perfect game into the fifth inning while outclassing Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw in the showdown of superstar pitchers.\n\nHe pitched one-run ball for six innings and struck out 10.\n\nScherzer did everything that was asked of him in the eighth but the Nationals bullpen still had its struggles. Hudson, 32, loaded the bases with two outs before striking out Corey Seager for the save.\n\n\u201cI feel like I had some good stuff tonight,\u201d said Hudson. \u201cI was just trying to battle. That\u2019s a really good lineup, you really got to feel your way through it.\u201d\n\nNationals third baseman Anthony Rendon made one of the best catches of the game in the tense final inning. Rendon chased down Cody Bellinger\u2019s pop fly in shallow left field then fell over backwards while making the catch.\n\n\u201cWe just couldn\u2019t put anything together,\u201d said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.\n\nThe Nationals jumped on Kershaw for three runs in the first two innings. Kershaw is now 9-11 with a 4.33 ERA for his career in the playoffs.\n\n\u2013 Astros beat Braves \u2013\n\nElsewhere, Houston pitcher Justin Verlander threw seven scoreless innings and Jose Altuve belted a two-run homer to propel the Astros to a 6-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays in game one of their playoff series.\n\nVerlander took a no-hitter into the fifth inning and eventually departed having allowed just one hit and three walks while striking out eight in his 14th career playoff win.\n\nAltuve also lived up to his reputation as a playoff performer, breaking a scoreless tie in the fifth inning when he smacked a fastball from Rays starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow into the left field stands for a home run that also scored Josh Reddick.\n\n\u201cI was looking for a pitch that I can handle,\u201d Altuve said. \u201cI was just looking up and I got lucky. He threw it there and I could hit it.\u201d\n\nIn other NL Division Series action, Mike Foltynewicz threw seven solid shutout innings as the Atlanta Braves rebounded from a loss to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 3-0 and even their series at one game each.\n\nFoltynewicz earned his first career playoff win, allowing three hits and no walks while striking out seven batters.\n\nHe won the battle between two of the NL\u2019s top pitchers over the last two months as Cardinals ace Jack Flaherty took Friday\u2019s loss after the Cardinals won game one 7-6.\n\nFoltynewicz was an all-star in 2018 but his game dropped off, and he spent two months earlier this season in the minor leagues. Since being recalled he is 4-1 with a superb 1.73 ERA.\n\nIn New York, Gleyber Torres and DJ LeMahieu hit bases-loaded doubles, and the Yankees beat visiting Minnesota 10-4 in game one of the AL Division Series.\n\nThe Yankees beat the Twins for the 11th straight time in the postseason, dating back to 2004.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Max Scherzer pitched a solid inning out of the bullpen and reliever Daniel Hudson got out of a bases-loaded ninth inning jam as", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/04/055b03_washington-nationals-ace-max-scherzer-pitches-in-relief-in-eighth-inning-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
