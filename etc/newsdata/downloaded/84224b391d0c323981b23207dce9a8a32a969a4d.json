The revised code comes into force in January, giving industry a year to prepare before making their first submission in early 2020 on compliance.\n\nThe FRC will scrutinize the submissions and decide if firms can remain signatories, a de facto requirement for winning investment mandates in some cases.\n\nThe watchdog will publish the names of firms that meet the standards of the new code so that investors can compare them with current signatories.\n\nThe FRC published proposals earlier this year for revising its stewardship code, and the final version has been shortened to improve clarity.", "description": "UK asset managers face tougher checks on investment policy, green credentials", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9M27E_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
