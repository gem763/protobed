REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nMnuchin, in a wide-ranging news conference at the Treasury, said there was no invitation from Beijing for another high level meeting with Vice Premier Liu He on the trade deal outlined last week, but deputies were holding phone conferences this week.\n\n\u201cAs of now, there\u2019s no invitation and there\u2019s no plan\u201d for a high-level meeting. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t go,\u201d he said.\n\nMnuchin said he and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would speak with Liu next week by phone and the three were likely to meet in Santiago, Chile, ahead of an expected meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a Nov. 16-17 summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation countries.\n\nMnuchin said the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cobjective\u201d was for the agreement to be signed at the APEC summit.\n\nThe Trump administration has made no decision on how to address planned 10% tariffs on roughly $156 billion of Chinese goods due to take effect on Dec. 15 after opting not to proceed with a tariff rate increase slated for Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe have not gone to the president with any recommendation or any decision - obviously what we were all focused on was the October tariffs,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cWe\u2019ll address that as we continue to have conversations.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury chief, who has played a central role in the U.S.-China trade negotiations, dismissed suggestions China had not agreed with the United States on the substance of the initial phase outlined by Trump last Friday.\n\nMnuchin said the proposed Phase 1 text would include a \u201cquite broad\u201d chapter on protecting U.S. intellectual property rights in China, but only part of a chapter that aims to curb the forced transfer of American technology to Chinese firms.\n\nBeijing has denied its laws require such transfers and says any that occur are the result of commercial transactions.\n\nSome of the tech-transfer issues would be addressed in a second phase of negotiations, as would non-financial services, Mnuchin said, with openings of China\u2019s financial services market addressed in the first phase. The initial phase would also chapters on structural agricultural issues and currencies.\n\nMnuchin said Treasury had not determined how to address its designation of Beijing as a currency manipulator in its uncompleted October currency report, which was due on Tuesday. He said the two sides had agreed on currency provisions last week, which will be reviewed \u201cas we put out the report\u201d.\n\nThe Treasury chief also said some conversations with People\u2019s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang had eased some Treasury concerns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not prepared to go into the details of them other than to say that there were certain issues that he did get us more comfortable on, and more information,\u201d Mnuchin added.", "description": "U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators are working on nailing down a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents to sign next month, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday, adding he was prepared to travel to Beijing for more meetings if necessary.", "authors": ["Andrea Shalal", "David Lawder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441701539&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1ZI-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
