But he declined to discuss specifics, including whether the complaint involved the president, according to committee members.\n\nSeparately, a person familiar with the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint said it involves in part a commitment that Mr. Trump made in a communication with another world leader. The Washington Post first reported the nature of that discussion. But no single communication was at the root of the complaint, another person familiar with it said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Intelligence-Whistle-Blower-Complaint-Trump.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
