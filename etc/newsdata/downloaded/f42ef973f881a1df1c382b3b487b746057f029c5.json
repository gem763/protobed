Officials reported 156 police officers and 11 civilians injured and more than 300 people arrested.\n\nMillions in damages\n\nThe unrest started as a fare-dodging protest against the increase in metro ticket prices, which increased from 800 pesos to 830 pesos ($1.13 to $1.17) for peak-time travel, following a 20-peso rise in January.\n\nThe government recently raised subway fares from about $1.12 to $1.16 due to rising fuel prices.\n\nThe head of the subway system, Louis De Granges, said the vandalism caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage and said it was not clear when service could resume.\n\nAs a result, some 2.4 million people are likely to experience difficulties getting to work or school on Monday.", "description": "The supermarket was ransacked and set on fire as violent clashes between protesters and security forces continued.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/20/33773b96c3d940529c025ec6768f51c7_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
