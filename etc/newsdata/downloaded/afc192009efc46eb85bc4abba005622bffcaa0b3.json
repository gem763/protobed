Police shot Jawed S. in the lower body before arresting him.\n\nIn this image from August 2018, Dutch police officers point their guns at a wounded 19-year-old man who was shot by police after stabbing two people in the central railway station in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. A Dutch court today sentenced Jawed S. (pictured right of image on the ground) to almost 27 years in prison for the stabbing of two American tourists which left one of them wheelchair bound. Police stopped the attack by shooting the man in the lower body\n\n'He never showed any regret or remorse during his trial, repeatedly saying he would do the same again if his religion was insulted,' the judges said.\n\n'The risk of a repeat offence is therefore very high and the court finds it essential that society is protected against him as long as possible.'\n\nDuring his trial at a heavily-fortified courtroom, Jawed S. said he travelled to the Netherlands from Germany to 'protect the Prophet Mohammed.'\n\nHe also mentioned anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders, and his knife assault came a day after the far-right MP announced he was cancelling moves to stage a cartoon competition to caricature the Prophet Mohammed.\n\nThis file photo shows police cars gather around the scene of Jawed S's terror attack in August last year. On the day of his sentencing on Monday, judges said the Afghan born man had travelled from Germany to the Netherlands to 'kill as many people as possible'\n\nDutch prosecutors charged Jawed S. with two counts of attempted murder with a terrorist aim and judges found all accusations against him had been proven.\n\n'He (Jawed S.) came to the Netherlands to kill as many people as possible,' the judges said.\n\nThe wheelchair-bound victim has a severe spinal cord injury, while the second American man was stabbed in the right chest and arm.\n\n'Despite the fact that the threat was short-lived, it had a devastating effect on the two Americans and their spouses,' the judges said.\n\nThe wife of one victim also had a miscarriage two months after the attack.\n\n'The question whether she'll ever have children remains,' the judges said.", "description": "A Dutch court sentenced an Afghan man to just under 27 years imprisonment on Monday for the stabbing of two American tourists at Amsterdam's main railway station in August 2018.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/16/19696860-0-image-a-126_1571068601157.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
