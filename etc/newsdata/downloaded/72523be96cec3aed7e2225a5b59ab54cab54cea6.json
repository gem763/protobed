They are best avoided. Photo: BMW\n\nIt has come to my attention that you are considering a wrap for your car. And that wrap, as I understand it, is to be matte black. First, there are some things you want to consider.\n\nFirst, you don\u2019t have to do this.\n\nIt\u2019s OK.\n\nReally, it\u2019s fine. We\u2019ve all had this thought. It\u2019ll be cool. It\u2019ll be mean.\n\nWhat you may not have thought about are other colours. You can, in fact, paint or wrap your car in these colours instead of matte black. Colours that bring joy and light, happiness and insight, a spark of wonder and intrigue. These would be qualities unlike those of a matte black car, which is like a dungeon in which creativity is locked never to escape.\n\nInstead of painting or wrapping your car matte black, you could instead paint it:\n\nBlue\n\nForest Green\n\nOrange\n\nBrown\n\nCream\n\nSeafoam\n\nPink\n\nOlive Green\n\nSky Blue\n\nRobin\u2019s Egg Blue\n\nLime Green\n\nTeal\n\nTurquoise\n\nRed\n\nA Darker Red\n\nAn Even Darker Red\n\nOr Even Yellow\n\nI do hope that you will consider some if not all of these colours when considering painting or wrapping your car matte black, a tragedy that still can be averted.", "description": "It has come to my attention that you are considering a wrap for your car.
