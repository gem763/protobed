He then removed his shirt before disappearing down the tunnel.\n\nHere's everything Emery had to say about the game, the VAR decision that impacted it, and how he intends to deal with the Xhaka situation.\n\n(Image: ETIENNE LAURENT/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nOn Xhaka\n\nHe was wrong. We need to stay calm, speak to him internally about that.\n\nWe are working with the club and the players to play under pressure.\n\nWe are going to speak with him because the reaction was wrong.\n\nWe are here because we have supporters. We work for them and need to have respect for them when they are applauding us and criticising us.\n\nOn whether Xhaka we'll remain captain\n\nNow is not the time to talk about that.\n\n(Image: Visionhaus)\n\nOn the result against Crystal Palace\n\nWe can speak about our performance and the VAR decision.\n\nWe started very well and then conceded many chances so we should have controlled possession better to get more chances at 2-0 but usually the opposite team want to push more and then they scored.\n\nWe need to respect the decision, which was amazing, Last match here against Bournemouth, they didn't check for a clear penalty on Pepe and at Sheffield on Sokratis.\n\nOn the VAR decision\n\nVAR is positive but at the moment it is not working well.\n\nI think we deserved to win this evening. Only I can be disappointed about not controlling the match better.\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nI think VAR is very important for the referees because their mistakes are very important.\n\nWhen it's used in the right way but now we haven't checked a lot of things to not change the pace of the match.\n\nPepe and Soktratis' penalties were very clear but they didn't check. Maybe they are starting to check more after this week.\n\nThe next step is a monitor on the touchline to check because VAR is to help referees.\n\nOn the disallowed goal\n\nThat is not a fault. If you watch that, I'm sure you don't decide that is not a goal.\n\nI think Martin Atkinson needed to watch it again.\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nOn the fans\n\nI think the connection with the team was amazing.\n\nAfter the 2-2, the fans pushed for the victory and then there are some special circumstances.", "description": "Granit Xhaka was hooked in the second half at the Emirates and reacted badly to fans booing him", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Etienne Laurent Epa-Efe Rex", "Visionhaus", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20738518.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-FC-pre-match-press-conference-and-training-in-California-Los-Angeles-USA-16-Jul-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
