He also echoed Rockets head coach Mike D'Antoni in saying he didn't even need the move but wanted to add something to his repertoire anyway.\n\n\"I don't need it,\" Harden said. \"I can create shots and shoot shots whenever I want, obviously, but I try to do in the flow of the offense and things like that. Whether it's a step-back, one-legged shot, I'm able to get my shot off, I'm able to create enough space to shoot over a defender.\"\n\nIf there is an upside to Harden's new move, it's that it seems less controversial than his stepbacks. Harden recently railed against criticism that his step-back jumper is a traveling violation.\n\n\"The moves that I do and create aren't travels or the referees who are paid a lot of money and are the best at what they do would call a travel,\" Harden said. He added: \"Just because it looks awkward or different from what the world is used to. That's called being a creator. It's called changing the game. So live with it; and, hopefully your favorite players start doing it, too.\"\n\nHarden indeed appears to be the top creator in the game today.", "description": "James Harden's new signature move is a running, one-legged three-pointer that he even admits he doesn't need.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9361182e22af5ee4711fd8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
