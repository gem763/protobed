Smith gets roasted in devastating fashion by John Oliver on 'Last Week Tonight'", "language": "en", "text": "Stephen A. Smith got roasted on HBO. (Photo by Rich Barnes/Getty Images)\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this post, you probably already know all about Stephen A. Smith. The ESPN personality is ... unique. Smith\u2019s cadence, antics and volume of his voice have come to define him. You can probably take any sentence and imagine how Smith would say it using his trademark style.\n\nWhile Smith is a big deal in the sports world, there are so many people who aren\u2019t familiar with his rants. Thankfully, John Oliver was able to quickly explain what Smith is like in a segment on HBO\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWas Oliver accurate? You can be the judge of that.\n\nattn: SAS came up on Last Week Tonight & it's the good stuff pic.twitter.com/xfXAkc6PXT \u2014 Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) October 14, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s what Oliver said about Smith:\n\n\u201cHe tends to be loud, wrong and take pointlessly dramatic pauses.\u201d\n\nAfter a short clip plays, Oliver comes back with the following:\n\n\u201cAgain, if you\u2019re not a sports fan, and you\u2019re just now seeing Stephen A. Smith for the first time, let me address a few things quickly. One, I\u2019m sorry. Two, yes, he\u2019s always like that. And three, no one knows why.\u201d\n\nThat is both devastating and on point. It also hints at the absurdity of watching Smith for the very first time. Sports fans have known of Smith for such a long time that his schtick is just normal to those people. Someone seeing Smith for the first time would think his cadence and delivery were bizarre.\n\nWe\u2019re not here to pick on Smith. The man is such a masterful performer and troll that we have to begrudgingly respect it. With that said, we\u2019re still going to laugh about Oliver\u2019s description, because you can\u2019t sum up Stephen A. Smith better than that.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nStory continues\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip? Email him at christophercwik@yahoo.com or follow him on Twitter!
