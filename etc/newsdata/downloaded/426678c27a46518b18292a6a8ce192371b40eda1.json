Last week the Kentucky senator released a Facebook video promising to stop Democratic-led impeachment in its tracks.\n\nQ&A How do you impeach the US president? Show Hide Article 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are. The process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives. The chief justice of the US supreme court then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote to convict. Republicans currently control the Senate, with 53 of the 100 senators. Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him. Martin Belam\n\nThe unusual fracture emerged on Sunday night when, shortly after a phone conversation between Trump and Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the White House announced removal of US troops from the Syria-Turkey border area. \u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria,\u201d it added.\n\nCritics of all political stripes have long feared that the move could open the way for a Turkish strike on Kurdish-led fighters in the area. Kurdish groups have fought alongside a small US presence in Syria to drive Islamic State militants from the region.\n\nThe Republican backlash was rapid and potentially unnerving for a president whose fate is tethered to the party and the assumption that it will acquit him in the Senate if, as widely expected, the Democratic-led House of Representatives votes for impeachment.\n\nLindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, who has become an outspoken defender (and frequent golf partner) of Trump, did not acquiesce this time. Abandonment of the Kurds would be \u201ca disaster in the making\u201d, he said, and \u201ca stain on America\u2019s honour\u201d.\n\nGraham told Fox News: \u201cI hope I\u2019m making myself clear how short-sighted and irresponsible this decision is. I like President Trump. I\u2019ve tried to help him. This, to me, is just unnerving to its core.\u201d\n\nGraham wrote on Twitter that if the plan goes ahead, he will introduce a Senate resolution opposing it and seeking reversal of the decision. He added: \u201cWe will introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if they invade Syria and will call for their suspension from NATO if they attack Kurdish forces who assisted the US in the destruction of the ISIS Caliphate.\u201d\n\nKevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House, whose attempts to defend Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president have provoked mockery, said: \u201cIf you make a commitment and somebody is fighting with you, America should keep their word.\u201d\n\nMichael McCaul of Texas, the lead Republican on the House foreign affairs committee, also urged the president to reconsider. \u201cThe United States should not step aside and allow a Turkish military operation in north-east Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cThis move will undermine our ongoing campaign to prevent an Isis resurgence and will ultimately threaten our homeland.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the United States needs to stay engaged to prevent further destructive involvement in the region from our adversaries like the Assad regime, Putin and Iran.\u201d\n\nNotably, senator Marco Rubio of Florida, reluctant to criticise Trump even when the president suggested that China investigate former vice president and 2020 election rival Joe Biden, was clear , describing the retreat as \u201ca grave mistake that will have implications far beyond Syria\u201d\n\nAnd Nikki Haley, Trump\u2019s former UN ambassador, admonished Trump without mentioning his name. \u201cWe must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cThe Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake. #TurkeyIsNotOurFriend\u201d\n\nOminously for Trump, even conservative Fox News aired dissent. Host Brian Kilmeade described the pullout as \u201ca disaster\u201d, telling viewers of Fox & Friends: \u201cAbandon our allies? That\u2019s a campaign promise? Abandon the people that got the caliphate destroyed?\u201d\n\nRepublicans who have contradicted Trump before did so forcefully again. Utah senator Mitt Romney described Trump\u2019s announcement as \u201ca betrayal\u201d, adding: \u201cIt says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster.\u201d\n\nRomney and Democratic senator Chris Murphy issued a joint statement insisting Trump\u2019s administration \u201cexplain to the American people how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests\u201d.\n\nDemocrats also piled in but there was a lone voice of support for the president on Capitol Hill. Republican senator Rand Paul, long a critic of foreign intervention, said: \u201cSo many neocons want us to stay in wars all over the Middle East forever. [Trump] is absolutely right to end those wars and bring the troops home.\u201d\n\nTrump himself was undeterred by the blowback. Speaking at the White House on Monday, he said he has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for the prominent Republican critics.\n\nAnd added: \u201cPeople are extremely thrilled because they say it\u2019s time to bring our people back home. We\u2019re not a police force. They\u2019re policing the area. We\u2019re not a police force. The UK was very thrilled at this decision \u2026 many people agree with it very strongly.\u201d\ufeff", "description": "Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham lead condemnation of foreign policy move that could prove \u2018disaster in the making\u2019", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc0bb26d20a224bdeb58841b281bf71f4714db36/0_126_4809_2885/master/4809.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5f251e5035ac9ac22543b0e3d3ab93f5", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
