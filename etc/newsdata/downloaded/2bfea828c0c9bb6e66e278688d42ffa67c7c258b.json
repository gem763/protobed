I was so self-conscious. I was in shock at what I ended up going through for what I\u2019d thought was a simple procedure.\"\n\n\"As a result, I decided to train in facial aesthetics to understand what had gone wrong. But now, I also want to help other people looking to get fillers done to make sure they understand the risks,\" Najjar said. \u201cI get so many women coming in for corrective work after getting botched fillers, and they always say the same thing: \u2018I went somewhere cheap.\u2019 But you have to think, it\u2019s cheap for a reason, and it ends up costing you far more to fix it.\u201d\n\nNajjar did very little research before going ahead and having lip fillers done in 2016 \u2014 her first cosmetic procedure \u2014 believing it to be a simple procedure.\n\n\u201cI admit I didn\u2019t research it much, which really isn\u2019t like me at all,\" she said. \"But I never got told about the risks or complications that could arise.\u201d\n\nAfter her appointment \u2013 during which one milliliter of filler was injected into her lips \u2013 she experienced some swelling, which she assumed was normal.\n\nA week later, though, it became clear that something had gone terribly wrong.\n\nBABY BORN WITH RARE HEART TUMOR TO SEEK SURGERY IN US: 'EVERY DAY IS AN UNKNOWN,' MOM SAYS\n\n\u201cMy lips were very lumpy and uneven, so I went back to the injector who had done them, and they suggested that even more filler would even them out,\" she said. \u201cLooking back, I know that\u2019s not right now, but at the time, I trusted what I was being told and just wanted it fixed. So, I had another one milliliter injected \u2013 meaning I\u2019d had two milliliters in just two weeks.\n\n\u201cI woke up and my lips were more swollen than ever \u2013 literally about two-centimeters in front of my face \u2013 and rock hard,\" she said. \u201cI had to go into work and my manager was really shocked, asking me what on earth had happened.\u201d\n\nThankfully, the swelling eventually eased, but Najjar said that her lips were lumpier than ever.\n\n\u201cI was having to massage my lips to break the filler down,\" she said.\n\nWith a family wedding approaching, and wanting to ensure she looked presentable, Najjar had no choice but to find a dermatologist who could help reverse the damage.\n\nAfter researching extensively, she found a specialist who was able to inject her with hyaluronidase \u2014 a family of enzymes that can break down hyaluronic acid, the ingredient used in most lip fillers.\n\n\u201cThat cost me ($900) \u2013 more than double what I\u2019d paid for the original fillers,\u201d she said. \u201cI did have a slight allergic reaction to the hyaluronidase and my mouth swelled, but I was given antihistamines. I actually had the appointment on Christmas Eve, so it was amazing they could see me, as I assumed the doctor would be closed or very busy. I was under review for two days after that and, thankfully, my lips began returning to normal.\u201d\n\nShaken by her experience, Najjar decided to take a course in facial aesthetics herself on London\u2019s renowned Harley Street.\n\nNow, after becoming officially trained and qualified to perform injectable filler procedures, she works at a dental practice in Bristol, where she uses her own experience to make sure patients fully understand the potential risks.\n\nMOM CLAIMS EPIDURAL FAILED DURING EMERGENCY C-SECTION: 'IT WAS LIKE LIVING IN A NIGHTMARE'\n\n\u201cI was never told about risks or complications, so I want to make sure that the patients who come to me understand exactly what will happen before I put that needle in,\" she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t explain to them that there may be complications, and that hyaluronidase, which they would need to dissolve the filler, is very expensive \u2013 plus there is currently a shortage in many parts of the world, so not every doctor has easy access to it \u2013 then you are leaving them vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThe NHS shouldn\u2019t have to be dealing with people going to [emergency rooms] with complications like occlusions, when blood vessels get blocked, but the difficulty is that people aren\u2019t told the risks and so don\u2019t know what to do,\" she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also really important to give people a cooling-off period, so they have 24 hours to go away and think about whether, now they have all the information, they actually want to go ahead. It\u2019s not right to do it there and then, as they can feel pressured.\u201d\n\nNajjar has expressed concern about the rise in people with no medical training injecting filler into their clients.\n\nAccording to a 2017 statement by the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), dermal fillers remain unregulated in Britain, meaning \u201canyone wielding a syringe can order them off the internet\u201d and the procedures are often performed in unsterile, non-clinical environments.\n\nAn internal survey by BAAPS of their membership \u2013 also conducted in 2017 \u2013 found that four out of five surgeons have recorded a rise in requests to fix botched procedures, with nearly a third stating that the original work had \u201cclearly been carried out by someone with dangerously inadequate training.\u201d\n\nKeen to combat the amount of people turning to unqualified people for such cosmetic work, Save Face now provides a national register of accredited practitioners of non-surgical cosmetic treatments recognized by the Department of Health, NHS England and the Care Quality Commission.\n\nThis enables prospective patients to check whether their practitioners have specialist training and use licensed products from reputable suppliers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worrying, the amount of unqualified people now doing dermal fillers,\" Najjar said. \"Beauticians don\u2019t necessarily go through proper medical training \u2013 they just learn from each other \u2013 and can\u2019t prescribe medication if need be, or deal with complications. Make sure ask to see to a practitioner's portfolio so you have an idea what their work is like and what to expect of the treatment.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cDoctors and dentists train for years and years, yet there are people going on one-day courses claiming to be able to do the same thing,\" she said. \u201cWhen they\u2019re charging low fees for work too, you have to ask yourself why. How cheap is the filler they\u2019re using? You can easily buy it online for as little as ($45) a milliliter \u2014 and that\u2019s not something I\u2019d put in my own face, let alone my patients.\u201d", "description": "Sarah Najjar, a dentist, said she didn't do much research before the procedure and wasn't told about potential risks or complications.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Sarah-Najjar-1-PA-Real-Life.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
