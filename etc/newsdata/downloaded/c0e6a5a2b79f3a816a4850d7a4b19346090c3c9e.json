You should have called me the first time this happened [broken heart emoji].'\n\nRebekah's spokesperson also told MailOnline: 'Please refer to Becky\u2019s social media posts.\n\nWag-atha Christie: Coleen tweeted these words back in January, highlighting how she has been trying to get to the bottom of who was selling stories on her life for some time\n\nFootballer's Wives: Netflix have even tweeted to say they are planning on turning this story into something major\n\n'It isn\u2019t true, she is now very upset and stressed so has passed it to her legal team to deal with.
