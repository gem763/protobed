Time\n\nMEMPHIS \u2014 People of faith gather in a park at the U.S.-Mexico border in California every Sunday to celebrate communion.\n\nThey can't share the bread, wine or juice with each other through the wall that separates the two nations and bodies of Christ. They can barely see each other through the multiple layers of wire mesh.\n\nSeveral years ago, 50 United Methodist bishops stood on either side of the wall to celebrate communion. \"I know of no greater call to repentance than the border wall, which separates parents from children, husbands from wives, friends from friends,\" Rev. John Fanestil, of First United Methodist Church of San Diego, said afterward.\n\nAug. 30: In a storm, 'the church' is bigger than Joel Osteen's building\n\nAug. 19: Church rebukes white supremacy but can't ignore white privilege\n\nAug. 8: Faith in America: Elvis Presley and his American trilogy of baptisms\n\nThe call seems likely to get louder. Earlier this month, the Trump administration chose four companies, representing Alabama, Arizona, Mississippi and Texas, to build prototypes of a border wall \"between 18 and 30 feet high.\"\n\nCongress has set aside $20 million for prototypes. The Trump administration's 2018 budget includes $2.6 billion for \"tactical infrastructure and border security technology.\"\n\nMany Christian leaders and most of the largest denominations view President Trump's long-promised border wall as more spiritual fracture than tactical infrastructure.\n\n\"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian. This is not the gospel,\" Pope Francis said after he visited Mexico in 2016.\n\nSept. 13: Trump administration fast-tracks replacement of California border wall section\n\nAug. 31: Border wall prototypes will start going up in weeks\n\nEarlier this year, dozens of denominational leaders sent a letter to Congress opposing construction of a border wall.\n\n\"Our unique traditions call us to value the dignity and worth of every person and to protect creation,\" the letter said. \"A border wall and other forms of senseless border militarization are inconsistent with these values.\"\n\nNot all Christian leaders see it that way, especially those who have the president's ear.\n\n\"God is not against building walls!\" Robert Jeffress, the Southern Baptist megachurch pastor preached at an Inauguration Day service attended by President-elect Trump.\n\n\"It\u2019s not a biblical command for the country to let everyone in who wants to come, that\u2019s not a Bible issue,\" Franklin Graham told the Huffington Post in January.\n\nTruth is, there's already some sort of wall, fence or barrier along 700 of the U.S.-Mexico border's 2,000 miles. Two tall barriers run through Friendship Park on the border, established in 1971 as a symbol of friendship between two neighboring nations.\n\nAug. 29: Meadows: Freedom Caucus may be willing to wait to fund Trump's border wall\n\nAug. 24: Border wall dispute threatens once again to shut down government\n\n\"May there never be a wall between these two great nations. Only friendship,\" first lady Pat Nixon said at the park's inauguration as Secret Service agents cut three stands of barbed wire so she could hug Mexican children.\n\nThere's no hugging anymore at Friendship Park. Border security has been tightened a number of times since 1994's Operation Gatekeeper, the Clinton administration's effort to act tough on immigration.\n\nVisitors who want to visit with those across the border have two choices. They can see each other by standing behind barriers about five feet on either side of a tall slatted fence. Or they can talk privately and touch fingertips through thick metallic mesh.\n\nDuring weekly communion services, people of faith on both sides of the wall face the 12-foot barrier with hands held low, asking God's forgiveness. They reach their hands to the sky to receive God's pardon. Then they \"pass the peace\" by placing their hands on either side of the wall.\n\n\"By your Spirit make us one with Christ,\" they say with faith and conviction, \"one with each other, and one in ministry to all the world.\"\n\nDavid Waters writes for The (Memphis) Commercial Appeal.
