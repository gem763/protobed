FINMA Chief Executive Mark Branson said at a Bloomberg event in Zurich that he is \"much more nervous\" about projects being cultivated \"in the dark\" than he is about the social media giant-backed digital coin, which he said is on the radar of international regulatory bodies. Three months ago, Facebook (NASDAQ: ) announced plans to launch the digital currency in June 2020, sparking intense interest -- and opposition from France and Germany -- in what is seen as a bid to drag cryptocurrencies into the mainstream. Organizers of the push have said the project could be delayed, amid global scrutiny.\n\nSwitzerland's FINMA boss says Facebook's Libra handled transparently", "description": "Switzerland's FINMA boss says Facebook's Libra handled transparently", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF902Q5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
