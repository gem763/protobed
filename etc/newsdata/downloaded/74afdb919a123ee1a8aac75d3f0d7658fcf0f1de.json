Actually, there is no need for it,\u201d Shahril told PAC in the April meeting.\n\n\u201cSo we actually [are] going to consolidate everything to one office at a cheaper location. So, right now we are in KLCC as well as KL Sentral.\n\n\u201cWe probably close down the one in KLCC and move everybody to KL Sentral. That saves us about RM20 million a year, just in rental alone,\u201d he added.\n\nHe was responding to then committee chairman Datuk Seri Ronald Kiandee who asked whether Khazanah was planning to cut down its manpower to reduce its overall cost of operation by about 30 to 40 per cent.\n\nShahril said Khazanah was also planning on closing down some of its offices overseas which it deemed not necessary.\n\nHe also said that Khazanah will ensure that it is not overpaying its staff, although he insisted that Khazanah needs to offer attractive pay as it is competing with other investment banks and sovereign wealth funds.\n\nKhazanah currently has two offices in Tower 2 of the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC) and Mercu UEM in KL Sentral.\n\nIn July, The Malaysian Reserve quoted an anonymous source saying the move would probably take place in the first half of 2020.\n\nIt reported that the move will relocate 300 staff members, coinciding with the lapse of the lease agreement for the Twin Towers office.\n\nKhazanah owns the 29-floor Mercu UEM building through its fully-owned subsidiary UEM Group Bhd.\n\nPAC said yesterday it is satisfied with Khazanah\u2019s explanation over its RM6.3 billion loss last year, which was due to: a change in the government\u2019s telecommunication policy, financial reporting standards, and a change in investment strategy.\n\nRelated Articles Too few local biz class flyers to keep Malaysia Airlines airborne, Khazanah concludes Khazanah: Too many airlines based here bad for Malaysia Airlines, weaker ones need to quit Why did Khazanah lose RM6.3b in 2018?
