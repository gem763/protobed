In 1992, a Psychological Bulletin review of 205 studies that took note of gender differences in self-disclosure found that overall, women opened up to other people slightly more than men. And a smaller 1980 study published in the Journal of Counseling Psychology found that men were more likely to reveal things about themselves to strangers and acquaintances, while women were more likely to reveal things about themselves to intimate friends. \u201cThe results suggest a tendency for men to avoid emotional intimacy with one another,\u201d the authors of the study wrote.\n\nGottlieb attributes men\u2019s hesitance to open up to the fear that doing so can make someone look weak. \u201cIt just shows how much shame there is for men around talking about anything that feels vulnerable to them,\u201d she said.\n\nMichael Slepian, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s business school who has researched secrets and secrecy, thinks that many men are reluctant to open up because doing so goes against stereotypically masculine values. \u201cOne of the main reasons people confide a secret is to get help,\u201d Slepian told me. \u201cAnd confiding a secret in another person, it\u2019s also an act of intimacy \u2026 That kind of warmth and sociality and intimacy is also stereotypically more feminine.\u201d Stereotypes about men, meanwhile, emphasize \u201cagency, independence, autonomy,\u201d Slepian said\u2014essentially, the absence of a need for help.\n\nBut regardless of what stereotypes dictate, Slepian emphasized that, as his research has found, being able to confide secrets in someone is just as important for men\u2019s psychological health as it is for women\u2019s. Sharing a secret with anyone, Slepian told me\u2014even if it\u2019s not the main person the secret would be relevant to\u2014\u201creduces how much you ruminate on the secret. It reduces how much you repetitively return to thoughts of the secret, and that\u2019s related to improvements in well-being.\u201d\n\nRead: No one keeps your secrets better than your therapist\n\nAt the end of Gottlieb\u2019s Atlantic Festival session, one audience member asked how therapists can go about reducing the stigma around men going to therapy, especially within minority communities with more rigid stereotypes about masculinity. Gottlieb responded that the benefits of therapy have to often be seen, in others or in oneself, to be believed\u2014and that it\u2019s at least partly on service providers to ensure that people see those results. \u201cI think part of it is access,\u201d she said, \u201cand part of it is just seeing other people you know be open about it\u2014like, \u2018Yeah, I go to therapy\u2019\u2014and making that a normal thing.\u201d", "description": "And they would probably benefit from confiding in more people.", "authors": ["Ashley Fetters"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_130992476_toned/facebook.jpg?1569516747", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
