Ultimately, there is a lot of noise above here and extending towards the 3025 level, so we aren\u2019t out of the woods yet, but clearly it looks as if the market is trying to knock on the high levels. Short-term pullbacks intraday will probably continue to be looked at as buying opportunities as one of the mantras on Wall Street is \u201cthe Fed has your back\u201d, and that of course drives stocks higher longer term.\n\nS&P 500 Video 16.10.19\n\nTo the downside, I believe that the 50 day EMA which is currently trading at the 2950 level should offer enough support that people continue to look towards this market for gains. At this point, I believe that there will more than likely be a nice \u201czone of support\u201d between the 2950 level and the 2940 level. Ultimately, this is a market that we need to pay attention to above, because if we do break out to the upside and above the recent highs, it can take off towards the 3100 level. This is certainly the time of year it could, because fall earnings season tends to be a rather impulsive move just waiting to happen.\n\nTo the downside, if we break down below the 2940 level then it\u2019s likely that we go looking towards the 200 day EMA which is currently trading at the 2880 I am bullish, but I recognize that looking for value on pullbacks probably continues to work best.\n\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "Bank earnings came out early on Tuesday, showing signs of strength again, and that of course has the S&P; 500 rallying.
