Today we are where we are and it was a good journey so far.\"\n\nThere is no likelihood of complacency setting in, however, even if the club are at their highest level since the Rafael Benitez era, another Champions League-winning manager who came up just short in winning the title in 2009.\n\nKlopp has freshened up his long-standing successful coaching triumvirate of him, Krawietz and Zeljko Buvac, with the latter departing in April last year after a fall-out with the German to be replaced by the highly-rated coach Pep Lijnders.\n\nHe has also overhauled the squad by a process of evolution not revolution.\n\nIn his first transfer window he made just two signings: youngster Marko Grujic for \u00a35.1million, who was immediately loaned back to Red Star Belgrade, and Steven Caulker, who barely featured, on loan.\n\nThe likes of Sadio Mane and Georginio Wijnaldum arrived the following summer, and 12 months later Mohamed Salah, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and arguably his best-value buy Andy Robertson (for \u00a38m) were signed.\n\nHe suffered his first big-name loss in January 2017 when Philippe Coutinho was lured to Barcelona but that was offset by the arrival of Virgil Van Dijk, at the time the world's most expensive defender at \u00a375m.\n\nThe final pieces of the jigsaw arrived with the \u00a365m signing of goalkeeper Alisson Becker, along with midfielders Naby Keita and Fabinho.\n\nOf the squad Klopp inherited those who remain are captain Jordan Henderson, Joe Gomez, Roberto Firmino, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, James Milner, Divock Origi, Sheyi Ojo (on loan at Rangers) and Nathaniel Clyne, who has played just 10 times for Liverpool in the last two full seasons and would not still be at the club were he not currently injured.\n\nVirtually all of that group have improved significantly under the former Borussia Dortmund and Mainz coach's stewardship.\n\n\"In the best case, people learn and develop,\" added Krawietz.\n\n\"We changed and developed as well. You should always try to get better, that's the interesting thing.The game is developing; we try to be inventive.\n\n\"Our philosophy, our style of play won't change too much but the details are always interesting.\n\n\"With the energy and the fuel, you need to go on, try to proceed and try to stay successful.\"", "description": "Liverpool\u00a0assistant manager Peter Krawietz believes Jurgen Klopp is well on his way to building a long-lasting legacy at Anfield.
