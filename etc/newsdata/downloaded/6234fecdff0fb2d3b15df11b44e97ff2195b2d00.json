It existed during the Cretaceous period, around 76 million years ago.\n\nThe partial skeleton was found in Dinosaur Provincial Park in southern Alberta in 1992, but had long been confused with another genus of pterosaur until further analysis, published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, showed the creature was unique.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

This tells us a great deal about the anatomy of these large flyers, how they flew and how they lived.\u201d\n\nFor decades, scientists wrongly classified the remains as the Quetzalcoatlus species of pterosaur, first found in Texas.\n\nWhen Professor Habib, who was measuring the bones to map how the creatures flew, saw the skeleton four years ago, he began to suspect it was unique.\n\nHe was able to establish it was an azhdarchid, one of the largest types of pterosaur ever known. But his real breakthrough came while studying the creature\u2019s neck vertebrae.\n\nProf Habib discovered that the arrangement of pneumatophores \u2013 the holes through which air sacs entered the bones\u2019 interior \u2013 were unlike that of any other known azhdarchid.\n\n\u201cThe creature is similar to the largest pterosaurs known, yet key characteristics gleaned from the cache of bones show it\u2019s actually part of a new genus and species,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis particular group of pterosaurs includes the largest flying animals of all time. Their anatomy holds important clues about the limits of animal flight and may be important in the future for biologically inspired mechanical design for flight.\u201d\n\nResearchers next hope to establish how the muscles of the \u201dfrozen dragon\u201d might have attached to its bones to gain better insight into how it moved.\n\nProf Habib wishes to further measure the bones to learn more about how it flew \u2013 the scientific process that first led him to the species\u2019 discovery.\n\nAdditional reporting by SWNS", "description": "A flying dinosaur discovered buried in Canadian ice nearly 30 years ago has been confirmed by scientists as a new species.
