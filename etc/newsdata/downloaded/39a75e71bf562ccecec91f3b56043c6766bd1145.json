The New York Times later said the informant had sent secrets to Washington for decades.\n\nTwo sources familiar with U.S. monitoring of Russian activities confirmed to Reuters that such a CIA informant did exist inside the Russian government and had been extracted and brought to the United States.\n\nThe sources indicated that U.S. officials were seriously concerned that Kremlin officials had made public what they claimed was the individual's name.\n\nRussian daily newspaper Kommersant said Tuesday the official may have been a man called Oleg Smolenkov, who is reported to have disappeared with his wife and three children while on holiday in Montenegro in 2017 and is now reported to be living in the United States.\n\nThe newspaper cited unnamed Russian law enforcement officials as saying Moscow had initially opened an investigation into his suspected murder in Montenegro before concluding he was alive and living abroad.\n\nKommersant published a picture of a house in Virginia that it said had been bought by a man called Smolenkov in 2018.\n\nAsked about the matter, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Smolenkov had really worked in the Russian presidential administration, but had been fired in 2016-17.\n\nOne U.S. official familiar with the background to the story said it was not necessarily totally stupid or against standard spy practice for a defector to buy property in his own name. He did not say why.\n\nBut now that the story had become public it was highly likely the U.S. government would have to make serious efforts to protect the defector, said the source, who did not dispute the mole was Smolenkov.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking at a White House briefing, dismissed reports that the CIA pulled the informant out of Russia over concerns the asset's identity could be exposed.\n\n\"The reporting there is factually wrong,\" said Pompeo, without elaborating.\n\n'A bull's-eye on his face'\n\nDaniel Hoffman, a former CIA station chief with deep expertise on Russia, said the informant is a marked man because Putin cannot risk Russian officials \"thinking they can get away with betraying Russia.\"\n\n\"This means that guy has a bull's-eye on his face,\" said Hoffman, who noted that a 2006 law empowers Putin to order extrajudicial killings outside Russia. \"When Vladimir Putin has known about high-value sources who he says betrayed Russia, he tried to kill one of them with a Soviet nerve agent, and he killed another with polonium.\"\n\nHe was referring to the 2018 attempted murder in Britain of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer and double agent for British intelligence, with the nerve agent Novichok and the 2006 killing with radioactive polonium of Alexander Litvinenko, a Russian intelligence officer who received political asylum in Britain.\n\nNo access to Putin\n\nPutin, seen here on Sunday, reportedly tried to have a former Russian military intelligence officer and double-agent killed in 2018 with a suspected nerve agent, former CIA station chief Daniel Hoffman said. (Sputnik/Alexei Nikolsky/Kremlin via Reuters)\n\nAsked about the matter, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Smolenkov had worked in the Russian presidential administration but had been fired in 2016-17.\n\n\"It is true that Smolenkov worked in the presidential administration, but he was fired several years ago. His job was not at a senior official level,\" said Peskov.\n\nSmolenkov did not have direct access to Putin, Peskov added, declining with a laugh to confirm whether he had been a U.S. agent or not.\n\n\"I can't confirm that.\u2026 I don't know whether he was an agent. I can only confirm that there was such a person in the presidential administration, who was later sacked.\n\n\"All this U.S. media speculation about who urgently extracted who and saved who from who and so on \u2014 this is more the genre of pulp fiction, crime reading, so let's leave it up to them,\" said Peskov.\n\nSmolenkov at different times worked at the Russian Embassy in the United States, in the Russian government administration and in the Russian presidential administration, open-source documents inside Russia show.\n\nHis wife worked in another Kremlin department, Kommersant said.\n\nIt cited some unnamed sources as saying they thought Smolenkov had only done routine work and could not have passed anything more than \"two-bit rumours\" to the Americans.\n\nBut other sources were cited as saying that Smolenkov worked with and enjoyed the trust of Putin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov who does have access to the Russian leader.\n\n\"This is serious,\" it cited one unnamed Russian official as saying.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said separately on Tuesday he had never heard of Smolenkov.\n\n\"I have never seen this man, have never met him and have never monitored his career or movements,\" Lavrov said.\n\nCNN reported on Monday that the U.S. decision to extract its informant had occurred soon after a May 2017 meeting in the Oval Office, in which U.S. President Donald Trump had discussed highly-classified intelligence with Lavrov.\n\nLavrov said Tuesday that nobody had divulged any secrets to him at the meeting with Trump.\n\nA U.S. government source also insisted that Trump did not disclose secrets, such as the informant's existence or identity, at any meeting with Russian officials.", "description": "The Kremlin is playing down U.S. media reports of a CIA spy inside Russia's presidential administration, calling them \"pulp fiction,\" but said a low-level official who Russian media suggested was the agent had worked there before being fired.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4383454.1568142223!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/russian-hackers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
