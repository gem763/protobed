United had several delays recently because they also took the plane out of its rotation until November.\n\nAfter the Ethiopia crash and the earlier crash in Indonesia, Boeing made a software fix as both crashes were found to have been tied to the plane's anti-stall system. The slow installation and subsequent pilot trainings have hamstrung airlines reliant on the planes during one of the busiest summers for travel ever. TSA said that eight of the 10 busiest days it has ever had have come since May.\n\nAmerican said earlier this week that the grounding of the jet has cost them $185 million in lost income in just the second quarter alone. Delta is one of the few major airlines that does not use the model, and analysts and company executives have said that is a key reason for the company's solid earnings report.\n\nSenior leadership at the aircraft manufacturer and FAA officials believe there's still a chance for the planes to be back by the fall, but the Journal article predicts that 2020 is the most likely scenario.\n\nBoeing's stock, currently trading at a little more than $359 (R5,000) a share, has fallen by more than nearly $100 (R1,300) since its 2019 high of more than $440 (R5,500) a share in early March. After the second crash in Ethiopia, the company's stock fell as low as $337 (R4,600) a share but has since rebounded.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "American Airlines removed Boeing's 737 Max, which crashed in Ethiopia and Indonesia in the last nine months, from its plane roster until November.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/118/9dcf860ddefe4a9fbdafdbe18d625fa8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-15"}
