So, if we don\u2019t address ourselves to that, as a long-term play in PNG, and work with and through government, work with the Aussie government and with other partners to address [it], then in my personal view there will be a very challenging operating environment in the future.\n\n\u201cEven in five years time with 130,000 barrels per day of oil coming out of Alaska and with hopefully three more (liquid natural gas trains) in PNG, Alaska will still make up only about 20 per cent of our value. So you cannot forget the importance of Papua New Guinea to Oil Search. And you know, highlighting one of the things that I think is the biggest thing we need to manage is that over the life of our LNG project the population of PNG will double. And if you don\u2019t address the disenfranchised youth in your three communities, which account for 60 per cent of the population right now, you know, the chances of you having a stable environment in 20 years time are actually quite challenging.\u201d\n\nSymptomatic of the growing pressures of the \u201cyouth bulge\u201d is a collapse of the traditional structures of community governance, according to Botten.\n\n\u201cIf you want to identify the biggest change from when I started back in \u201992, it is that back then the tribal structures in the Highlands (which is where Oil Search produces all of its oil and gas) were very, very clear. You knew who you had to talk to. You knew which tribal leaders you needed to speak to and you knew things were good or bad depending on their view. You knew where the men owned the land, you knew where the women owned the land, you knew where it was owned by 40-50 people with long-term backgrounds.\n\n\u201cNowadays, with a bigger and bigger youth population, the break-down in tribal structures, the advent of mobile phones and social media means it is a far, far more complicated process of managing your communities. Because they don\u2019t have the structure, they don\u2019t have the clear accountabilities that were so clear back in 1992. So you have moved the way you manage your communities and interact with them in a very rapidly changing social environment,\u201d Botten said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is not a one faceted solution here. It has to be multifaceted and you need friends and you need partners to address it and to make a difference.\u201d\n\nOrica door revolving... again\n\nCan it be true that the executive doors at Orica\u2019s original 1955 \u201cskyscraper\u201d are revolving again?\n\nWe are hearing that the Schlumberger man bought in to drive reform at Orica\u2019s manufacturing operations, Carlos Duarte, is going to leave the business maybe six months earlier than his planned three-year term.\n\nAnd, as a result, chief executive Alberto Calderon has taken the opportunity to make a few more tweaks to his senior management team, some passing, others more permanent and indicative of the challenges of sectoral disruption.\n\nDuarte was introduced to Orica as part of the August 2017 reshuffle that, arguably, still sits as the most important in Calderon\u2019s still-evolving attempt to thoroughly recast the way the business goes about the task of making the raw materials of explosions.\n\nAccording to our sources, Duarte will spend the next six months or so seeing the ill-starred $800 million Burrup ammonia nitrate plant through the final stages of its costly and thoroughly humiliating rehabilitation.\n\nDuarte\u2019s departure will mean that both the new faces introduced to Orica in that 2017 reshuffle will have moved on. The first to go was Vince Nicoletti, who left the role of chief financial officer in 2018 after little more than a year in the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Duarte eyeballing the Burrup problem, the bloke who runs Orica\u2019s core Australia Pacific & Asia business, Darryl Cuzzubbo, will spend an increasing amount of time readying the manufacturing business for the introduction of Orica\u2019s $300 million SAP project.\n\nAll about the 4S\n\nThe Simple Standard Single SAP project (4S) is due to go live in April 2020 and once that happens former BHP man Cuzzubbo \u2013 who has made a pretty good fist of re-energising his portfolio \u2013 is presently due to return to normal duties.\n\nInternally, Orica has marketed the 4S project as \u201cthe final piece of the puzzle\u201d. And what is that \u201cpuzzle\u201d? It is the standardisation of manufacturing, supply chain, marketing, commercial and financial processes with the aim of improving the way the business understands itself, its suppliers and its customers.\n\nAs Calderon told me recently, under the 4S project Orica \u201cwill move from the donkeys to the space age\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Orica\u2019s Singapore-based chief digital officer, Chris Crozier, is said to be on the move.\n\nFrom what we hear, Crozier, another former BHP man whose reputation was built on a deep command of the logistics business, will take up a vice-president role in the manufacturing business where his focus will be the acceleration of Orica\u2019s unique digital and wireless offerings. Crozier will report to Cuzzubbo.\n\nAnd who is the tip to replace Duarte when Burrup\u2019s repair is complete? That has not yet been decided but apparently the most obvious candidate, Greg Leah, is the most likely one too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeah currently reports to Duarte as the head of continuous manufacturing and initiating systems. And there has been a gathering step-change in Orica\u2019s manufacturing operations with reliability now running above 80 per cent.\n\nFortescue watch\n\nReuters has reported that Fortescue Metals Group is in a race of two to secure the two blocks of the Simandou iron ore territory that are not owned by Rio Tinto and Chinalco.\n\nFortescue and Guinea\u2019s biggest bauxite producer are said to have reached the final stage in the auction of blocks 1 and 2 of Simandou.\n\nBut sources have suggested to us that Brazil\u2019s disaster-prone iron ore giant, Vale, is also still a runner in a race that, for all the goodwill in the world, is not likely to take anyone anywhere.", "description": "CEO says failing to deal with the disenfranchised of PNG's Highlands communities will expose Oil Search to challenging community instability.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7406%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_144%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/adebdc799f1648ea515bc16c08687310610bc447", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
