The 21-year-old known online as \"Blitzchung\" had just won $10,000 in the Hearthstone Asia-Pacific Grandmasters tournament when he declared in a livestream video interview in Mandarin: \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.\u201d He was wearing a gas mask and goggles, the same equipment worn by Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrators, when he made the statement, The Guardian reported.\n\nBLIZZARD BANS HEARTHSTONE PLAYER FOR SUPPORTING HONG KONG 'REVOLUTION'\n\nU.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle tweeted Tuesday that Activision Blizzard\u2019s decision to censor one of its players\u2019 political views speaks to a wider concern about China\u2019s market power being used as leverage to stifle free speech worldwide.\n\n\u201cRecognize what\u2019s happening here. People who don\u2019t live in #China must either self censor or face dismissal & suspensions,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., wrote on Twitter. \u201cChina using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally.\u201d\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said: \u201cBlizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party. No American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese tech company Tencent owns a 5 percent stake in Activision Blizzard, which earned $173 million, or about 12 percent of its total revenue, from the Asia-Pacific region last quarter, according to the company\u2019s public earnings report.\n\nChina's government has targeted an array of U.S.-based organizations, including the NBA, for perceived support of the Hong Kong anti-government protests. Apple Inc. became the latest on Wednesday when the ruling Communist Party's main newspaper criticized the tech giant for a smartphone app on its App Store that allows activists to report police locations and use of tear gas.\n\nChung addressed the controversy Tuesday in a livestream on a different service called Twitch, the New York Times reported.\n\n\u201cToday, what I have lost in Hearthstone is four years of time,\u201d he said, referring to the time and energy he\u2019s dedicated to play the game professionally. \u201cBut if Hong Kong loses, it would be the matter of a lifetime.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect my comments would make a huge impact,\u201d he continued, according to The Guardian. \u201cThis is my freedom of speech. ... I shouldn\u2019t be scared. I hope my act can inspire other gamers like me, to continue to support the movement in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nActivision Blizzard said in a statement that Chung had violated a tournament rule that prevents players from engaging in any act that \u201cbrings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we stand by one\u2019s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules,\u201d the statement said.\n\nA small group of Activision Blizzard employees gathered outside headquarters in Irvine, Calif., on Tuesday in support of Chung, The Daily Beast reported.
