Online court records show Ator was arrested in 2001 for a misdemeanor offence that would not have prevented him from legally purchasing firearms in Texas, although authorities have not said where Ator got his weapon.\n\nAtor acted alone and federal investigators believe the shooter had no ties to any domestic or international terrorism group, FBI special agent Christopher Combs said. Authorities said those killed were between the ages of 15 and 57 years old but did not immediately provide a list of names. The injured included three law enforcement officers, as well as a 17-month-old girl who sustained injuries to her face and chest.\n\nOdessa Police Chief Michael Gerke refused to say the name of the shooter during a televised news conference, saying he wouldn't give him notoriety, but police later posted his name on Facebook. A similar approach has been taken in some other recent mass shootings.\n\nHundreds of people gathered at a local university Sunday evening for a prayer vigil to console each other grieve the loss of life.\n\n\"We're out here in the middle of nowhere,\" Midland Mayor Jerry Morales told the crowd. \"All we've talked about is oil forever. And then this happens.\"\n\nGunman fired at random\n\nGerke said there were still no answers pointing to a motive for the chaotic rampage, which began Saturday afternoon when Texas state troopers tried pulling over a gold car on Interstate 20 for failing to signal a left turn.\n\nBefore the vehicle came to a complete stop, the driver \"pointed a rifle toward the rear window of his car and fired several shots\" toward the patrol car stopping him, according to Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Katherine Cesinger. The gunshots struck a trooper, Cesinger said, after which the gunman fled and continued shooting. He fired at random as he drove in the area of Odessa and Midland, two cities in the heart of Texas oil country more than 483 kilometers west of Dallas. At one point, he hijacked a mail carrier truck, killing the lone postal worker inside.\n\nU.S. Postal Service officials identified her as Mary Granados, 29.\n\nLaw enforcement officials process the crime scene on Sunday.

(Sue Ogrocki/Associated Press)\n\nPolice used a marked SUV to ram the mail truck outside the Cinergy Movie Theater in Odessa, disabling the vehicle. The gunman then fired at police, wounding two officers. Combs said the gunman might have entered the theatre if police had not killed him.\n\n\"In the midst of a man driving down the highway shooting at people, local law enforcement and state troopers pursued him and stopped him from possibly going into a crowded movie theatre and having another event of mass violence,\" Combs said.\n\nPolice said Ator had no outstanding warrants. His arrest in 2001 was in the county where Waco is located, hundreds of kilometres east of Odessa. Online court records show he was charged then with misdemeanor criminal trespass and evading arrest. He entered guilty pleas in a deferred prosecution agreement where the charge was waived after he served 24 months of probation, according to records.\n\n'Too many of these events'\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said a 17-month-old girl is recovering but faces surgery on Monday to remove shrapnel from her right chest. She also suffered injuries to her face. Abbott says the mother texted: \"Her mouth is pretty bad, but will heal and can be fixed. Thankfully it doesn't seem like her jaw was hit. Just lips, teeth and tongue...We are thanking God for healing her and appreciate continued prayers.\"\n\nThe shooting came at the end of an already violent month in Texas, where on Aug. 3 a gunman in the border city of El Paso killed 22 people at a Walmart. Sitting beside authorities in Odessa, Abbott ticked off a list of mass shootings that have now killed nearly 70 since 2016 in his state alone.\n\n\"I have been to too many of these events,\" Abbott said. \"Too many Texans are in mourning. Too many Texans have lost their lives. The status quo in Texas is unacceptable, and action is needed.\"\n\nBut Abbott, a Republican, remains non-committal about imposing any new gun laws in Texas at a time when Democrats and gun-control groups are demanding restrictions. And even as Abbott spoke, a number of looser gun laws that he signed this year took effect on the first day of September, including one that would arm more teachers in Texas schools.\n\nSaturday's shooting brings the number of mass killings in the U.S. so far this year to 25, matching the number in all of 2018, according to The AP/USATODAY/Northeastern University mass murder database. The number of people killed this year has already reached 142, surpassing the 140 people who were killed of all last year. The database tracks homicides where four or more people are killed, not including the offender.\n\n'What's the world coming to?'\n\nWitnesses described gunfire near shopping plazas and in busy intersections.\n\nDr. Nathaniel Ott was working at an Odessa emergency care centre where he is the medical director when he heard gunshots. He rushed outside to find a woman in the driver's seat of an SUV bleeding from a gunshot wound in the arm. Ott said that as he and a paramedic were working on the woman, the shooter drove back by.\n\n\"The shooter drove within 30 feet [9 metres] of us and drove up that road,\" Ott said Sunday, pointing to one of the streets leading past the shopping centre where his facility is located. \"The shooter was driving. It was insane. He was just everywhere.\"\n\nWatch: A man talks about fleeing the theatre in Odessa\n\nEthan Baeza, his brother and their mother had to evacuate a theatre in Odessa, Tex., because of gunfire nearby 1:49\n\nDaniel Munoz, 28, of Odessa, was headed to a bar to meet a friend when he noticed the driver of an approaching car was holding what appeared to be a rifle.\n\n\"This is my street instincts: When a car is approaching you and you see a gun of any type, just get down,\" said Munoz, who moved from San Diego about a year ago to work in oil country. \"Luckily I got down. ... Sure enough, I hear the shots go off. He let off at least three shots on me.\"\n\nHe said he was treated at a hospital and is physically OK, though bewildered by the experience.\n\n\"I'm just trying to turn the corner and I got shot \u2014 I'm getting shot at? What's the world coming to? For real?\"", "description": "Authorities said Sunday they still could not explain why a man with an AR-style weapon opened fire during a routine traffic stop in west Texas to begin a terrifying, 16-kilometre\u00a0rampage that killed seven people, injured 22 others and ended with officers gunning him down outside a movie theatre.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5267662.1567390778!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/shooting-texas.jpg"}
