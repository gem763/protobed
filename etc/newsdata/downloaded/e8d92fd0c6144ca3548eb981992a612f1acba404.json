Hyde, a veteran of World War II who fought in the battle for the Philippines, had an abiding personal interest in post-war political developments in Asia, including the challenges posed by a rising China. In his remarks, he saw political developments in Hong Kong as a key test as to whether Beijing would emerge as a responsible stakeholder or, alternatively, an authoritarian threat in the 21st Century.\n\nSpeaking of Hong Kong, he said: \u201cMany years ago, those laboring in mines deep underground, faced the deadly problem of the buildup of fatal but undetectable gases. To warn them of approaching danger, they would bring with them a small and fragile bird, imprisoned in a cage, which became known as the miners\u2019 canary\u2026Hong Kong is the miners\u2019 canary. Its vulnerability makes it an unmistakable indicator of the course of China\u2019s historic transition and the impact it will soon have on us all. We must watch carefully.\u201d\n\nHyde died in 2007. Yet his words of caution remain relevant for Americans today. These include President Trump who, according to a CNN report on October 4th, made another questionable promise on Hong Kong in one of his now-famous phone calls to global leaders: \u201cDuring a private phone call in June, President Donald Trump promised Chinese President Xi Jinping that the US would remain quiet on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong while trade talks continued.\u201d CNN further reported that the State Department told then-U.S. Consul General in Hong Kong, Kurt Tong, \u201cto cancel a planned speech on the protests in Washington because the President had promised Xi no one from the administration would talk about the issue.\u201d\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "An unintended consequence of the current unrest in Hong Kong has been to derail Xi Jinping\u2019s proposal to use the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula to settle the Taiwan issue.", "authors": ["Dennis P.
