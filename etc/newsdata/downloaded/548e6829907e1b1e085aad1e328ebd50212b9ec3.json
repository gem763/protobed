'Chris does not change his running gait as his eyes were only on the ball.\n\n'Jonny Evans is never going to get there in a million years [even if he doesn't fall]. There was contact but it's not deliberate. The players are incredibly frustrated. The officials have had a tough day.'\n\nMeanwhile, Raul Jimenez was denied a hat-trick for Wolves against Southampton after having two first-half goals disallowed by VAR, firstly for handball and then for offside before scoring a second-half penalty.\n\nRaul Jimenez took the ball past Angus Gunn to score for Wolves, only for VAR to disallow it\n\nConor Hourihane thought he had equalised against Brighton for Aston Villa\n\nThe double ruling saw Wolves come away with just a point in a game in which they looked likely to secure all three for most of the game.\n\nAs if VAR hadn't been involved enough in Saturday's games there was also controversy at Villa Park as Conor Hourihane thought he had found an equaliser for Aston Villa against Brighton only for the technology to intervene and rule that Wesley had fouled goalkeeper Matt Ryan in the build up.\n\nDean Smith was raging at the decision, but it would ultimately not prove decisive for the Villans, as a late Matt Targett goal secured all three points.\n\nNo doubt the growing pains will continue deep into this season, the first of which VAR has been deployed in the Premier League.\n\nFans, players and officials are still learning how best to effectively use the technology and the frequent controversy continues to set tongues wagging up and down the country.", "description": "Dele Alli had a late equaliser against Watford disallowed and then allowed by VAR on another day of controversial moments for the technology in the Premier League.", "authors": ["Cian Cheesbrough For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/17/19930504-0-image-a-27_1571501824325.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
