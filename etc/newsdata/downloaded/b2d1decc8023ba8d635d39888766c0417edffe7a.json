possibilities ahead after the onerous Blake Bortles era. Those dreams were quickly shattered moments later though when Foles was stretchered off with a broken clavicle, seemingly ending their season before it had even begun and restricting the immediate potential of Chark and what could have been a breakout season.\n\nBut then came the emergence of the fearless backup Gardner Minshew, who resembled a quarterback conjured up for a comic book with his bandana and thick moustache. Minshew combined with the flimsy Kansas City defence suggests all is not lost for the Jags and Chark himself, who collected just four catches, but gashed the Chiefs for 146 yards in the 40-26 loss.\n\nIf the focus in his touchdown route was most impressive, then it was his perseverance when collecting a pass from Minshew in the second quarter that jumped out: twisting and gyrating his way past Charvarius Ward for a 69-yard completion.\n\nChark is unlike the vast majority in the league who are desperately honing their craft to ensure they remain treading water against the relentless competition that can see you discarded to the streets in an instance. At just 22 years of age the former LSU star looks to have a promising future.\n\nContinue in this vein and Chark may become the player others look to scrutinise in the endless pursuit of becoming the \u201cunstoppable\u201d weapon every quarterback craves.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always looking to take something small out of each one,\u201d Chark reiterates. \u201cIf I could be a combination of all of them, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do, make it my own, I\u2019d be an unstoppable player with that swag.\u201d", "description": "DJ Chark tilted his head back transfixed on the flight of the ball as it plunged down like a missile, hauling in the catch despite Kendall Fuller\u00a0clambering all over his back for his maiden touchdown in the NFL.\u00a0 For the Jaguars wide receiver it was the culmination of an arduous few months following an inconspicuous rookie season that ended in disappointed with the team", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/12/15/gettyimages-1173473320.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
