This time, the three drinks he ordered all came back labelled \u201cIsis\u201d.\n\nRelated: Coffee shop racism: where America's racial divisions are exposed\n\nAs well as being an Egyptian god, an alternative name for the river Thames and a song by Bob Dylan, Isis is the common acronym for the Islamic State terrorist group. Johnson said seeing the word on his beverages made him \u201cshocked and angry\u201d.\n\n\u201cI felt it was discrimination,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement to the Post, Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said: \u201cAfter investigating, we don\u2019t believe this was a case of discrimination or profiling.\n\n\u201cThe customer approached and provided the name Aziz. The barista mistakenly spelled it incorrectly. We have connected with Mr Johnson and apologized for this regrettable mistake.\u201d\n\nBut Borges\u2019 simple statement belied a baffling, labyrinthine story.\n\nJohnson told the Post Starbucks claimed to have answered a complaint he filed by email via a phone conversation with his niece, Alora.\n\nBut Johnson insisted such a phone call could not have occurred. He does not have a niece named Alora and the nieces he does have are too young to have such a conversation.\n\nJohnson provided to the Post a recording of an exchange with a Starbucks representative in which he made clear his confusion and anger.\n\n\u201cSo that is a new revelation for me and us, Niquel,\u201d the Post quoted the representative as saying. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how we got to that point. I apologize.\u201d\n\nThe Post said the identity of the woman Starbucks says it spoke to remains a mystery.\n\nThis is not the first time a Starbucks store in Philadelphia has attracted national media attention, stoking intense debate about race and racism through the interaction between an employee and customers.\n\nLast year, two African American men were arrested after a Starbucks worker in the city called police because the men were sitting peaceably but not ordering anything. The men eventually settled for $1 each and a promise from the company that it would set up a $200,000 programme for young entrepreneurs.\n\nStarbucks\u2019 chief executive, Kevin Johnson, apologised and ordered more than 8,000 stores closed for an afternoon, so that nearly 175,000 employees could be trained about the dangers of unconscious bias.\n\nJohnson told the Post that the outcome of that case made him think Starbucks would treat his complaint seriously.\n\n\u201cYou think they would have their facts in order,\u201d he said. \u201cHow could they allow anyone to speak for me?\u201d", "description": "Niquel Johnson said when he ordered at a Philadelphia store he gave his Islamic name, AzizThe Starbucks logo on a shop in Pennsylvania.
