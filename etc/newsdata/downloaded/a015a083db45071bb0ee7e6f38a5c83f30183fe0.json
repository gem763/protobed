He had habitually pored over the questions and answers afterwards, he said, trying to learn as many as he could by heart, and invited friends over for quiz nights in which they switched between the roles of contestant and quiz master.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I have spent almost 16 years re-enacting the show on my own quiz stage, complete with all the buzzer and bell sound effects, certainly gave me an advantage,\u201d he told the tabloid Bild in an exclusive interview.\n\n\u201cOf course the excitement was huge, especially having applied so often, and then to really be sitting opposite Herr Jauch, my biggest fear was to have a blackout.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stroh answers questions on the quizshow. \u2018My biggest fear was to have a blackout,\u2019 he said. Photograph: kommunikation.mediengruppe-rtl.de\n\nHe said he was able to relax after answering the \u20ac500 question. \u201cI thought to myself: everything will be fine, just try to imagine this is a normal quiz evening at my own quiz stage.\u201d He said trust in his own instinct and the support of friends proved to be his best aids.\n\nWer Wird Million\u00e4r, based on the original British format, runs twice a week and is a magnet for television audiences in Germany.\n\nThe British version first aired in 1998 and was broadcast for the last time in 2014 after audience figures waned. The format continues in 50 countries worldwide and the German version is the longest-running.\n\nIt has proved enduringly popular, despite the fragmentation of the media landscape. It attracted almost 6 million viewers on Monday night, or 22.6% of the audience share. Despite the fall in the number of young people watching TV, it attracts a 21% of 14- to 49-year-olds, according to the industry observer Meedia.\n\nAt its height a decade ago, when WWM ran three times a week, its audiences were up to 8 million. Out of 2,800 candidates, 11 \u2013 including Stroh \u2013 have gone home as millionaires. Jauch, its presenter, himself a multimillionaire, has called it \u201cthe last campfire around which several generations continue to gather together\u201d.\n\nStroh said he was not planning to give up his job working as a lawyer for the city of Hamburg, but wanted to use his \u20ac1m (\u00a3910,000) to buy a new suit, go on holiday to Australia, donate money to a charity working to protect the common swift and to give his quiz cellar an extensive makeover.", "description": "Jan Stroh built replica studio in his cellar, complete with palm trees and sound effects", "authors": ["Kate Connolly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ca0bb9f1c39e44a9fee966e6d929febaa5ca2cb/495_467_3047_1828/master/3047.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=45c8d00d638d7b86e131027536b1b955"}
