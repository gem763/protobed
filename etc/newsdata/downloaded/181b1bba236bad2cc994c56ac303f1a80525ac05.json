After being medically cleared to return, Slovis will get the shot to lead USC against the powerhouse Irish in the schools\u2019 famed intersectional rivalry game.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not that much more you can ask for,\u201d Slovis said. \u201cIt\u2019s Notre Dame and USC. \u2026 They\u2019re a good team, obviously one of the best teams in the nation, but Coach Helton is going to put together a great game plan for us.\u201d\n\nSlovis got hurt on a heavy hit during the opening series of USC\u2019s win over then-No. 10 Utah on Sept. 20. He sat out of a loss at Washington on Sept. 28 for the Trojans, who had last week off.\n\n\u201cHe does not look out of form to me,\u201d Helton said of Slovis, who threw to receivers during the Trojans\u2019 week off. \u201cHe looks really good, and we\u2019ll continue through the week. Today, I thought he was very decisive with his decision-making. So hopefully that continues and he carries it to South Bend.\u201d\n\nThe 18-year-old Slovis took over for injured starter J.T. Daniels at halftime of the Trojans\u2019 season opener and led them to a win over Fresno State. He propelled USC past Stanford one week later with a record-setting performance for a USC freshman quarterback in his first start, passing for 377 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nDespite throwing three interceptions in an overtime loss at BYU one week later, Slovis still ranks second in the FBS in completion percentage (.779), trailing only LSU\u2019s Joe Burrow.\n\nMatt Fink replaced Slovis for the past two games, leading USC to a win over the Utes and a loss to the Huskies. Fink went 40 of 62 for 514 yards in his appearances, while Slovis is 60 of 77 for 732 yards.\n\nBoth quarterbacks have thrown four interceptions apiece in coordinator Graham Harrell\u2019s version of the Air Raid offense. Harrell has been an ardent supporter of Slovis since spring ball, noting the freshman\u2019s surprising maturity and an ability to thrive in the up-tempo offensive scheme.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed with a lot of things about him, but since the day he\u2019s been here, I don\u2019t ever think it\u2019s been too big of a moment for him,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cNever had the big eyes or the deer-in-the-headlights look. He always carries himself with confidence and expects good things to happen.\u201d\n\nUSC got more good injury news Tuesday when Helton confirmed that half of his starting secondary could be back in uniform.\n\nSafety Talanoa Hufanga is expected to play at Notre Dame after missing USC\u2019s last game with an apparent concussion. Hufanga was in the middle of a breakout sophomore season as the Trojans\u2019 leading tackler before his head injury and a shoulder problem, but the bye week helped him greatly, Helton said.\n\nCornerback Olaijah Griffin also is progressing toward a return Saturday after missing the Trojans\u2019 loss at Washington with a back injury, Helton said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis will return from an apparent concussion to start for Southern California at No. 9 Notre Dame on Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/usc_slovis_football_11875_c0-128-3063-1913_s1770x1032.jpg?8068bf1cf25d65af48cc888050c666e1933f4500", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
