In this case, the United States.\n\nIt has been a constant theme in the history of the Kurds, an ethnic group indigenous to parts of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. The quest for their own country where they could freely speak their own language, a right denied them for most of the 20th century, has come to define the Kurds, along with the broken promises of world powers that are happy to enlist the tough mountain people to fight their battles, but in the end find a reason to cut a deal with the national governments that have standing armies \u2014 and oil.\n\nSmoke billows from targets inside Syria during bombardment by Turkish forces.

In withdrawing a token force of American troops from an area of northeastern Syria, Trump opened the door for Erdogan\u2019s \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d to create a 300-mile \u201csafe zone\u201d \u2014 safe for Turkey, that is \u2014 along the Syrian border and rid it of what Erdogan described as a Kurdish \u201cterror army.\u201d\n\nThat army was the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, which had borne the brunt of the war to destroy the Islamic State group\u2019s caliphate, a prime goal of American policy and an achievement Trump frequently claims as a personal victory. Critics, including many Republicans, denounced the move as both a moral and political debacle, a betrayal of allies who had fought alongside American troops, a humanitarian disaster in the making, and an opening for ISIS to regroup in the growing power vacuum.\n\nA resolution in the United Nations Security Council condemning the Turkish invasion, supported by most European nations, was opposed by the United States \u2014 and Russia.\n\nU.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces fighters pose for a photo on a rooftop overlooking Baghouz, Syria, after the SDF declared the area free of Islamic State militants after months of fighting last March.

For millennia, Kurds \u2014 traditionally farmers and herders skilled in carpet weaving, copper working and fighting on horseback (like the Kurdish warrior hero Saladin) \u2014 lived in the contiguous mountain regions of what today are Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran. Estimated to be some 36 million strong, most of whom are Sunni Muslim, they\u2019re united by their Kurdish language \u2014 similar to Farsi in Iran \u2014 and a hope for their own country, an idea first officially dangled in the country-building era following World War I.", "description": "When President Trump pulled troops from a region of northeastern Syria, it was denounced as a \u201cshameless betrayal\u201d of the Kurds, who were left on their own to fight off an invasion by Turkey. But Kurdish history is filled with such betrayals.", "authors": ["Melissa Rossi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tW7TQmQ_dg.5TqPRXe.eBQ--~B/aD0zNTQzO3c9NTI0MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/46963a20-ec50-11e9-99f7-704c411baaf8", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
