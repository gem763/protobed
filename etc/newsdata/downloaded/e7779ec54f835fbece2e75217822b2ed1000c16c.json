Trump said they were backed by Iran and blustered that the U.S. is \u201clocked and loaded\u201d while awaiting Saudi Arabia\u2019s direction on how to proceed.\n\n\u201cI absolutely do not believe, Joe, that that would be in the interest of the United States to go to war with Iran on behalf of an attack on Saudi oil infrastructure,\u201d said Rhodes.\n\n\u201cThe American military should certainly not be for sale to the highest bidder,\u201d Rhodes continued. \u201cEspecially someone like Mohammed bin Salman, who\u2019s been demonstrated to be a murderous dictator killing a journalist for the Washington Post in a consulate in Turkey while also launching this war in Yemen that has had disastrous consequences.\u201d\n\nRhodes noted that Saudi Arabia is not an ally of the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe have no obligation to come to the defense of their oil facilities and increasingly they\u2019re a country that should concern us in terms of their complete rejection of democratic values,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd so again, I think the American people would look at this and not think it was a wise idea go to war on behalf of this particular Saudi leader.\u201d\n\nRhodes acknowledged it was \u201ca mistake\u201d for the Obama administration to provide support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Since then, Saudi Arabia under bin Salman has taken \u201ca dark, dark turn,\u201d he added.\n\nCheck out the full interview here:", "description": "Ben Rhodes explained why the U.S. has \"no obligation\" to come to the defense of Saudi Arabia's oil sites.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d80d45824000012277c86ea.jpeg?cache=cq0pgu0ybs&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
