REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\n\nThe Finnish state-controlled utility has been seeking control of Uniper since 2017 but the German company\u2019s top management had opposed a full takeover, warning it could result in a break-up and threaten the firm\u2019s credit rating.\n\nIf approved by regulators, the agreement between Fortum and the two activist funds would simplify the complex ownership structure that has made resolving the stand-off difficult.\n\nIt would also round off Fortum\u2019s portfolio in the area of base-load round the clock energy supply, driven by Uniper\u2019s fleet of coal- and gas-fired power plants.\n\n\u201cWhile we are focused on leading the transition to cleaner energy, we also understand that we have to meet the needs of our customers in terms of security of supply and affordability,\u201d Lundmark Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark said.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s where Uniper comes in because we can\u2019t just fast-forward to the future.\u201d\n\nAs part of the deal, Fortum would pay 29.93 euros per share for the combined stake of more than 20.5% held by the two funds. This equates to a price of 2.3 billion euros ($2.5 billion) and will raise Fortum\u2019s Uniper stake to more than 70.5% from 49.99%.\n\nUniper, Knight Vinke and Elliott all declined to comment.\n\nShares in Uniper fell 9% to 27.22 euros per share after Fortum said it would rule out any domination agreement, profit and loss transfer agreement or squeeze-out of minority shareholders for at least two years. Fortum\u2019s stock rose 1%.\n\n\u201cIt has been Fortum\u2019s preference to agree with Uniper on a joint path forward, yet discussions have each time ended short of actions,\u201d Fortum said, though it added that talks with Uniper\u2019s management over the past months have been \u201cvery constructive\u201d.\n\nFortum said it was convinced that the change in Uniper\u2019s ownership structure and the resolution of the complex relationship would bring stability and return its focus to business matters.\n\nThe agreement still needs to be cleared by the United States and Russia. Russian regulators have so far capped Fortum\u2019s ownership in Uniper at 49.99% due to a strategic water license operated by the German firm\u2019s local subsidiary Unipro.\n\nLundmark told analysts that discussions with Russian regulators over the past months have \u201cled us to believe that there is a solution available to the issue\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe would not have taken this step unless we (were) quite confident that an approval could be obtained.\u201d he added.\n\nFortum said it had made a preparatory filing to the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), and said it expected the transaction to close by the end of the first quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cUniper\u2019s Russian water business is likely to be a key area of concern where countermeasures may be necessary,\u201d Bernstein analysts said. \u201cHowever, we think it is unlikely that Fortum would make this move without having had some plan in place.\u201d\n\nAn FAS spokesman said the regulator had been notified about Fortum\u2019s bid to buy Uniper, but did not provide further details.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nHoping to win over workers, Fortum also pledged to honor all existing collective bargaining agreements at Uniper, and said it would not cause the German group to implement forced layoffs or relocate its headquarters away from Duesseldorf.\n\nCredit Suisse said in a note that the deal was positive for Fortum, as it will deliver synergies and help to resolve the deadlock.\n\nFortum said it would fund the deal with existing cash resources and credit facilities underwritten by Barclays.", "description": "Fortum is set to gain control of Uniper by acquiring the stakes of activist funds Elliott [ECAL.UL] and Knight Vinke, a step that could end a long-running deadlock over ownership of the German energy firm.", "authors": ["Anne Kauranen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438403855&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970NQ", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
