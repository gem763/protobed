Even now, when most caviar comes from farms, eating it is controversial. So why do so many restaurants refuse to give it up?\n\nThere are some words that are impossible to say without sounding fancy. \u201cCaviar\u201d is one of them. It\u2019s the hallmark of fine dining; the crown jewel of a canape; one of the last few foods that, in a world of lobster baps and truffle mash, remain flashy. When the Sous Chef website looked at the UK\u2019s two- and three-Michelin-starred restaurants this month, it found that caviar featured on 72% of the menus.\n\nYet there is no denying caviar has an image problem. Until just a few decades ago, fishermen would haul beluga sturgeon out of the Caspian and Black seas, cut out the \u201croe sacks\u201d that held their eggs, and throw the fish back in to die. As a result, sturgeon became critically endangered. The international trade in wild sturgeon from the region has been banned since 2006, and although there are a growing number of sturgeon farms around the world that attempt to make the process more sustainable, the methods used to extract the eggs, and the morality of dedicating valuable resources toward producing this symbol of luxury, mean the ethics of caviar remain vague.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like shark-fin soup, where you have desperate fishermen catching sharks, cutting off their fins and throwing them back,\u201d says Chris King, executive chef of the Langham hotel in London. \u201cThere\u2019s a moral question to caviar, of course, but sturgeon can be farmed. It is farmed.\u201d Serving the caviar he sources for the Langham is, he says, no more or less ethically troublesome than serving quality beef or farmed Scottish salmon. What matters to King is that he buys the best and serves it in such a way that his diners \u201cunderstand what the fuss is about. Most people don\u2019t have it often. It\u2019s important they get a good chunk, and it\u2019s served in an elegant way.\u201d\n\nYet attitudes towards sourcing and serving caviar are shifting. Although the Langham still offers it in those gleaming round tins, to be eaten by the spoonful, it is rarely called for nowadays; gone, too, is the demand for blinis with a dollop of creme fraiche. \u201cThese days, I sell caviar much more in dishes where it is an element, such as our roasted scallops with caviar,\u201d King says. \u201cTastes are changing, and people are asking if tins and blinis are really the way to appreciate caviar, with all its nuances of texture and taste.\u201d\n\nCharles Smith, head chef at the Lords of the Manor hotel in Gloucestershire, says he values caviar \u201cmore for the flavour profile than the prestige around it\u201d. He likes to dish it up alongside native lobster, whose sweet meat pairs perfectly with the eggs\u2019 saltiness. \u201cThere will always be those people coming into the hotel and wanting a tin of caviar for the aesthetics of it, but to me it\u2019s an ingredient,\u201d he says. Gary Robinson, executive chef at Balmoral hotel in Edinburgh, takes a similar line: \u201cWe would only ever use caviar where a dish is enhanced by its taste and texture \u2013 never for opulence or show.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Smith has traded directly with a small producer in Germany: \u201cI know these guys; they look after their fish around the clock, provide the right nutrition, environment and so on. I feel comfortable serving this caviar, where I might not with a mainstream supplier.\u201d\n\nSo far, so above board. Yet even sustainable caviar can slip into murky waters. While some aquafarms harvest the roe alongside the flesh at the end of the sturgeon\u2019s life, others extract the eggs while the fish are still alive, around every two years. This would be fine were sturgeon like salmon, trout or other fish that can be \u201cmilked\u201d without too much trouble \u2013 but they aren\u2019t. \u201cThey are prehistoric fish, dating back 250m years, and they haven\u2019t changed much,\u201d says Harry Ferguson, operations director of Exmoor Caviar farm in Devon. \u201cTheir roe sack isn\u2019t like a bag from which the eggs spill out. You have to make at least a two-inch incision and massage the roe out.\u201d In its favour, this is better than killing wild sturgeon \u2013 and those farms that do produce caviar this way claim to make it as painless as possible.\n\nAs well as the ethical questions about egg extraction, there\u2019s also the issue of \u201cfish laundering\u201d, as Dr Krzysztof Wojtas at Compassion in Wild Farming (CIWF), points out. \u201cMackerel, sardines and other foraging fish are landed in Africa or South Asia, and processed for carnivorous fish food. By farming for caviar, you are using food that could feed the many to make a high-value product for the few,\u201d he says. The same could be said of salmon, another carnivorous farmed fish \u2013 but that\u2019s hardly an endorsement when you consider how negatively salmon farming affects the environment.\n\n\u201cPeople buy themselves nice shoes, facials, jewellery every single day \u2013 of course they should also buy caviar regularly,\u201d says Mark Zaslavsky, the CEO of Marky\u2019s Caviar in the US, whose New York restaurant lists a BEC, or \u201cbeluga bacon, egg and caviar sandwich\u201d among its brunch options. Yet just as farming has reduced salmon from a delicacy to a common sandwich filling, with the consequences of overstocking ranging from fish-lice infestations to pollution of the surrounding waters with faeces and chemicals, so CIWF fears the same could happen with sturgeon.\n\nBut that\u2019s impossible, says Ferguson, who says that sturgeon farming is not like salmon farming. \u201cThere is nothing we can do to cheat the system. There is no advantage to high stocking density, because it will adversely affect the flavour.\u201d Ditto poor standards of nutrition or welfare. No one is looking for budget caviar, he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in us producing anything less than the best.\u201d\n\nLike Marky\u2019s farm, Exmoor\u2019s Caviar\u2019s approach to producing sustainable and ethical caviar is to rear the fish to maturity, then use it all: roe, meat and organs. For King and Smith, the best way to respect caviar as an ingredient is to source it carefully, use it wisely (the Langham turns any caviar it doesn\u2019t sell into a salty seasoning) and serve it well. Some chefs outside the high-end market are opting for alternative fish roes; others, such as the chef Chung Chow of New York\u2019s Hawaiian restaurant Noreetuh, are keeping caviar for special occasions. \u201cIf we want to educate people about how caviar is produced, we need to depopularise it,\u201d Chow says. \u201cHaving more consumers in the market is not going to fix the problem.\u201d", "description": "The demand for its eggs almost made the beluga sturgeon extinct.
