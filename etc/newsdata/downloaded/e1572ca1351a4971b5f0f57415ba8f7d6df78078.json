The feature has been sending user data to Google Safe Browsing to cross-reference URLs against Google\u2019s blacklist for some time but it\u2019s unclear when the firm started sending data to Tencent.\n\nApple does note in iOS that it sends user data to Tencent but many users are likely still unaware of this as its mentioned on the \u201cAbout Safari & Privacy\u201d screen which is linked via extremely small text under the Privacy & Security section in the Safari browser settings. The Fraudulent Website Warning feature is also enabled by default meaning most users are probably unaware that their IP address may be logged by the Chinese tech company unless they turn the feature off.\n\nThe reference to Tencent was noted on devices running the latest version of iOS but some have suggested that data may have been sent to the Chinese firm as early as iOS 12.2\n\nIn iOS 12.2 beta 2 Safari now uses Tencent Safe Browsing in addition to Google Safe Browsing. pic.twitter.com/92pZKBmwWs \u2014 Stijn (@StijnDV) February 4, 2019\n\nThe implications of sending user data to Tencent\u2019s servers are currently unknown, but Johns Hopkins University professor Matthew Green has suggested that a malicious provider could possibly use Google\u2019s Safe Browsing approach to de-anonymize a user by linking their site requests.\n\nGreen believes that users \u201cdeserve to be informed about this kind of change and to make choices about it. At very least, users should learn about these changes before Apple pushes the feature into production, and thus asks millions of their customers to trust them.\u201d\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook recently defended the company\u2019s decision to remove the Chinese HKmap.live app from its store, stating that they had received \u201ccredible information\u201d from authorities that the software was being used \u201cmaliciously\u201d to attack police.\n\nThe company has flip-flopped repeatedly on whether the app should be allowed in the store, initially telling developers: \u201cYour app contains content \u2013 or facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity \u2013 that is not legal \u2026 specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement,\u201d and banning the app.\n\nFollowing an outcry over the initial banning, the app was reinstated to Apple\u2019s store. Now, following criticism from the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s main newspaper, The People\u2019s Daily, which stated that the app \u201cfacilitates illegal behavior,\u201d leading it to question if Apple was \u201cguiding Hong Kong thugs,\u201d The Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe have once against bowed to the wishes of communist China and removed the app.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
