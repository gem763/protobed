(\u201cAurora\u201d) (TSX: ACB) (NYSE: ACB) a global leader in the cannabis industry, have signed an exclusive, royalty-bearing commercial license agreement with sub-licensing rights (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) to use the Company\u2019s proprietary Radiant Energy Vacuum (\u201cREV\u2122\u201d) dehydration technology for the drying of cannabis in Australia. Aurora will hold an exclusive master license for the drying of cannabis using REV\u2122 in Australia and will work closely with EnWave to pursue sub-licensing opportunities. If certain minimum commercialization requirements are met, Aurora will receive an undisclosed share of royalties derived from any cannabis product dried with REV\u2122 technology by sub-licensees in Australia.\n\n\n\nConcurrently with the signing of the Agreement, EnWave and Aurora have signed a royalty-bearing sublicense (the \u201cSublicense\u201d) with Cann Group Limited (\u201cCann Group\u201d) (ASX: CAN), Australia\u2019s first Medical Cannabis Cultivation Licensee. The Sublicense grants Cann Group the right to use EnWave\u2019s REVTM technology to dry cannabis in Australia. Pursuant to the Sublicense, Cann Group has signed an equipment purchase agreement to obtain a 10kW REV\u2122 machine to initiate commercial production.\n\nThe Sublicense is the first sublicense granted by Aurora and EnWave and the fifth royalty-bearing commercial license agreement signed by EnWave to dry cannabis using its proprietary dehydration technology.\n\nAbout Cann Group Limited\n\nEstablished in 2014, Cann Group is the first company to be issued with a Cannabis Research Licence and Medicinal Cannabis Licence by the Australian Government\u2019s Office of Drug Control (ODC), and was subsequently issued with a Manufacture Licence by the ODC. These Licences authorize Cann Group to cultivate, produce and manufacture medicinal cannabis (in association with a relevant permit) for therapeutic and research purposes.\n\nCann Group\u2019s Board and management have extensive experience in the agriculture, agronomic and health research sectors and in developing and commercializing agricultural technology.\n\nCann Group has established R&D and cultivation facilities in Australia and is pursuing a fully-integrated business model with collaboration agreements, resources and capabilities that will enable it to establish a leading position in plant genetics, breeding, cultivation, production, manufacturing, and clinical evaluation to facilitate the supply of medicinal cannabis for a range of diseases and medical conditions.\n\nCann Group\u2019s vision is to be a leading developer and supplier of cannabis, cannabis resin and medicinal cannabis products.\n\nFor more information on Cann Group Limited, please visit www.canngrouplimited.com .\n\nAbout EnWave\n\nEnWave Corporation, a Vancouver-based advanced technology company, has developed Radiant Energy Vacuum (\u201cREV\u2122\u201d) \u2013 an innovative, proprietary method for the precise dehydration of organic materials. EnWave has further developed patent-pending methods for uniformly drying and decontaminating cannabis through the use of REV\u2122 technology, shortening the time from harvest to marketable cannabis products.\n\nREV\u2122 technology\u2019s commercial viability has been demonstrated and is growing rapidly across several market verticals in the food, and pharmaceutical sectors including legal cannabis. EnWave\u2019s strategy is to sign royalty-bearing commercial licenses with industry leaders in multiple verticals for the use of REV\u2122 technology. The company has signed over twenty royalty-bearing licenses to date, opening up nine distinct market sectors for commercialization of new and innovative products. In addition to these licenses, EnWave has formed a Limited Liability Corporation, NutraDried Food Company, LLC, to develop, manufacture, market and sell all-natural cheese snack products in the United States under the Moon Cheese\u00ae brand.\n\nEnWave has introduced REV\u2122 as the new dehydration standard in the food and biological material sectors: faster and cheaper than freeze drying, with better end product quality than air drying or spray drying. EnWave currently has three commercial REV\u2122 platforms:\n\nnutraREV\u00ae which is used in the food industry to dry food products quickly and at low-cost, while maintaining high levels of nutrition, taste, texture and colour;\n\n\n\npowderREV\u00ae which is used for the bulk dehydration of food cultures, probiotics and fine biochemicals such as enzymes below the freezing point, and\n\n\n\nquantaREV\u00ae which is used for continuous, high-volume low-temperature drying.\n\nAn additional platform, freezeREV\u00ae, is being developed as a new method to stabilize and dehydrate biopharmaceuticals such as vaccines and antibodies.
