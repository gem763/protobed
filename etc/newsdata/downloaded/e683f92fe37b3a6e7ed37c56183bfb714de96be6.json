In 2019, the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security benefits was 2.8%.\n\n\u201cIt sounds insignificant, but it's huge,\u201d says Andy Landis, author of \"Social Security: The Inside Story.\"\n\nCars under $30K: Don't miss these 12 upcoming new cars, SUVs\n\nCome here, car: Tesla owners test new feature enabling self-driving capability in private parking lots\n\n\u201cYour Social Security payments are inflation-proof, with an annual raise equal to the consumer price index or CPI,\" he says. \"Compound that over a 20-30-year retirement, and your seemingly-modest Social Security can become your biggest income source.\u201d\n\nWhat's the average benefit?\n\nCOLAs are important. But Social Security was never meant to be a person\u2019s primary source of income in retirement, say experts.\n\nJoseph Stenken, an advanced products consultant for Ameritas, a Lincoln, Nebraska-based financial services company, says the current maximum monthly benefit of $2,861, or $34,332 a year, should be a reminder for pre-retirees of how much (or how little) Social Security is available for them in retirement.\n\nAn even bigger reminder? Most beneficiaries receive far less than the maximum monthly benefit. Consider this: The estimated average monthly Social Security benefit payable in January 2019 was $1,461 for all retired workers, $2,448 for a couple both receiving benefits and $1,386 for a widow or widower. And this suggests, says Stenken, \u201cthat someone relying solely on Social Security for retirement income could be looking at a tough retirement financially.\u201d\n\nA tectonic shift is underway\n\nMen historically had been the bigger if not only breadwinner in a household and were more likely than women to receive Social Security under their own work record. But the gender gap is shrinking. According to the booklet, the proportion of men who will receive Social Security under their own work record declined slightly from 93% in 1970 to 90% 2018 while the proportion of women who have worked enough to receive Social Security under their own work record increased dramatically \u2014 from 63% in 1970 to 86% in 2018.\n\nThis represents \u201ca tectonic revolution\u201d in work and retirement, says Landis.\n\n\u201cIn past decades, women made up a minority of workers getting their \u2018own\u2019 Social Security, as opposed to a spousal payment,\" Landis says. \"Now women are a full 50% of \u2018retired worker\u2019 beneficiaries. Women have independently earned their own Social Security protection and payments.\u201d\n\nThat doesn't mean that spousal payments are obsolete. \u201cNearly every couple has a higher and a lower earner,\u201d says Landis. \u201cSpousal payments establish a floor payment level even for the lower earner in a couple.\u201d\n\nIt's time for a Social Security fix\n\nSocial Security is not sustainable over the long term at current benefit and tax rates, according to the booklet. Among other facts and figures, the booklet notes that in 2010, the program paid more in benefits and expenses than it collected in taxes and other noninterest income. And the 2019 Social Security Trustees report projects this pattern to continue for the next 75 years.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Trustees estimate that Social Security\u2019s trust fund reserves will be depleted by 2035. At that point, payroll taxes and other income will flow into the fund but will be sufficient to pay only about 80% of program costs.\n\nJim Blankenship, author of \"A Social Security Owner\u2019s Manual,\" finds some comfort in those projections.\n\n\u201cThe outlook is just a bit better than it's been in recent years,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we're looking at a depletion in 2035 versus 2033 and the projection is that 80% of benefits would be paid thereafter if nothing changes. It has been 75% or lower.\u201d", "description": "Social Security faces big challenges as it continues to undergo change and provide key benefits to Americans.", "authors": ["Robert Powell", "Special To Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
