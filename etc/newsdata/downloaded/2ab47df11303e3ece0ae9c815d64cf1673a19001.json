But those who speak out become targets of viral disinformation.", "language": "en", "text": "In the conspiracy-obsessed echo chambers of conservative talk radio and far-right websites, Sen. Mitt Romney has some explaining to do \u2014 answering for ties to the Ukrainian gas company that put Joe Biden\u2019s son on its board, and accounting for conversations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about Republican support for impeaching President Trump.\n\nIn reality, neither claim is true. No meaningful ties exist between Romney and Burisma, and he had no such conversation with Pelosi.\n\nThe flood of baseless attacks and misleading innuendo buffeting Romney, which began after he became a rare Republican to express concern about Trump\u2019s interactions with the Ukrainian president, serves as a preview of the viral attacks likely to be unleashed on GOP lawmakers if they buck their president during an impeachment showdown that Trump has denounced as a \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\nHolding the line on impeachment, particularly by pressuring Republicans to remain in lockstep behind Trump, has quickly become the core mission of a squadron of pro-Trump television personalities, talk radio hosts, conservative blogs, fringe Facebook groups and Twitter accounts. Together, these voices form an alternative worldview, built on hostility to mainstream media and capable of shaping the information consumed by core Republican voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tribal, and there are Trump cultists in the Republican Party who are constantly going to try to manufacture anything against the president\u2019s critics,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and Trump critic whose clients have included Romney as well as the late senator John McCain of Arizona. \u201cThe easiest place to manufacture and disseminate that stuff is online.\u201d\n\nRomney is not the only Republican to feel the heat in recent days. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), after defending the whistleblower who raised alarm about Trump and Ukraine, faced withering criticism from the Gateway Pundit, a far-right blog that gained White House press credentials in 2017. \u201cSo much for the Republican leaders in the Senate defending President Trump against the continuation of the attempted coup,\u201d the site warned.\n\n\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill on Sept. 23. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who said he was troubled by the whistleblower complaint, was accused by Big League Politics, a conservative website founded by former Breitbart employees, of \u201cstabbing [Trump] in the back.\u201d Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), who rebuked Trump for tweeting an ally\u2019s prediction that removing him from office would spark \u201ccivil war,\u201d was ridiculed as \u201cgarbage\u201d and, in the telling of an Infowars editor, an example of \u201cspineless sellouts.\u201d\n\nA Republican congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe dynamics within the party said: \u201cThese kinds of tactics are about one thing: scaring Republicans from getting out of line.\u201d\n\nThe Romney episode offers a case study in how Trump\u2019s allies respond when a Republican shows signs of breaking ranks.\n\nMany Trump backers have long been suspicious of Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and former Massachusetts governor, who in the 2016 primary delivered a speech calling Trump a \u201cphony\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d As a Senate candidate last year and since taking office, Romney has expressed openness to working with the president, and his criticism has been muted.\n\nThe day after details emerged about Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian leader, Romney issued a brief statement on social media that signaled disapproval, though with a hedge.\n\n\u201cIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme,\u201d he wrote on Sept. 22. \u201cCritical for the facts to come out.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Bill Kristol, the conservative columnist, speculated on MSNBC that Romney\u2019s comments \u201chelped reassure\u201d Pelosi as House Democrats moved toward an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe comment appeared to be the fodder for a fabricated notion by Rush Limbaugh, the pro-Trump radio host who claimed on Sept. 25 that Romney \u201chad phone calls or meetings, whatever, with Pelosi and assured her there was Republican support to remove Trump.\u201d The baseless claim, denied by Romney\u2019s office and debunked by a fact check, nevertheless drove conspiracy theories on conservative news sites, which also celebrated a video posted by Trump on Twitter mocking the senator from Utah for losing the 2012 presidential election.\n\nMeanwhile, Romney reiterated to reporters on Capitol Hill that the Ukraine controversy \u201cremains troubling in the extreme. It\u2019s deeply troubling.\u201d\n\nThe day after that, the attempt to discredit Romney intensified with a story in the American Thinker, a conservative news and opinion site founded by Thomas Lifson, who also writes for the conspiracy theory site Liberty Beacon. In an article on Sept. 26, Lifson declared that a Romney adviser was on Burisma\u2019s board of directors, suggesting that the connection was embarrassing for the Republican senator.\n\nThe article referred to Joseph Cofer Black, an ex-CIA official who had been a special adviser for foreign policy and national security on Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign.\n\nBut there is no sign of any connection between Romney and Burisma. Black was one of at least two dozen advisers on the campaign with his title, and he has no current affiliation with Romney. Moreover, according to Burisma\u2019s website, Black was added to the board in 2017, years after the Romney campaign ended.\n\nBlack did not respond to a request for comment placed through the Baltic International Bank, on whose supervisory board he also serves.\n\nBurisma\u2019s owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment, but the investigation was dormant when Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, and none of the references to Black in conservative media carry any evidence that he was a target of the probe.\n\nWithout evidence or explanation, Lifson suggested it was an \u201codd coincidence\u201d that Romney\u2019s former adviser was associated with Burisma. Lifson described Black as a \u201cCIA spook,\u201d language also employed in the far-right fringes of the Internet to attack the whistleblower who brought forth concerns about Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nLifson remained adamant in an email to The Washington Post, saying, \u201cAs I wrote in the blog piece, there are a lot of coincidences.\u201d\n\nTo Romney allies, the framing was clear. \u201cIt\u2019s simple guilt by association,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nLifson\u2019s article spread quickly in the right-wing information ecosystem, shared more than 18,000 times on Facebook, according to the social monitoring platform CrowdTangle. It appeared on a page promoting \u201cLEXIT,\u201d or a \u201cLatino awakening\u201d and exit from the Democratic Party, and in a group boasting nearly 50,000 members that goes by the name \u201cDonald Trump \u2014 God\u2019s choice for America!!!\u201d The article drove commentary on Reddit, the popular online messaging forum, and it gained traction among Twitter accounts that mobilize around the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d mantra for the pro-Trump movement.\n\nThe claims found their way to the most prominent parts of social media, where queries about Romney on Facebook at one point returned three articles by far-right outlets. Among them was Breitbart, which had picked up the story from the American Thinker.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary how quickly false information can spread,\u201d said Liz Johnson, a spokeswoman for Romney.\n\nThe onslaught was especially revealing because it showed how threads of factual information can be spun into a false narrative seemingly resistant to simple denial.\n\nInformation does not have to be fake or stolen to succeed in manipulating online discourse, experts warn. In fact, the underlying truth of misleading narratives can make them more insidious, and more effective in manipulating public perception as the 2020 election looms.\n\n\u201cThe best disinformation is built around a kernel of truth,\u201d said Jakub Kalensky, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council focusing on Russian information operations. \u201cIt\u2019s the framing that makes it dangerous.\u201d", "description": "The experience of Sen.
