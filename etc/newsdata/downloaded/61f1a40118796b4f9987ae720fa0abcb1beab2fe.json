The Supreme observed that it \u201cappeared Aarey was a forest at some point of time\u201d, and asked the state government to submit a status report on the number of trees felled so far and the compulsory afforestation by the Mumbai metro.\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, the court received a letter from a students\u2019 group against the axing of over 2,600 trees for construction of a Mumbai metro car shed at Aarey, and decided to pursue it as public interest litigation (PIL) and constituted a \u201cspecial bench\u201d to hear the matter.\n\n\n\n\u201cA special bench has been constituted to hear the matter tomorrow, October 7 at 10 am on the basis of a letter dated October 6 addressed by Rishav Ranjan with regard to the felling of trees in Aarey forest, Maharashtra which has been registered as public interest litigation,\u201d the court said in a notice.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, the Bombay High Court rejected a bunch of petitions filed by NGOs and activists against the tree felling at Aarey, post which, the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MMRCL) started axing trees. Determined to save the city\u2019s lungs, many gathered at the site, and protested against the act. Soon, the gathering increased and Mumbai Police imposed Section 144, thereby banning unlawful assembly.\n\n\n\nThe protesters have been demanding the relocation of the bus depot, which is a part of the Metro III project.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral well-known personalities had wished the student activists luck before the hearing of the case. \u201cThis is highly condemnable. We support these individuals in helping them get justice. The ruling parties cannot brush this aside till the elections are over,\u201d NCP\u2019s Supriya Sule. Filmmaker Ashoke Pandit had said, \u201cWishing all the enviornmentalist\u2019s who are fighting to #SaveAarey all the very best for the hearing at #SupremeCourt today. Let\u2019s all together pray for our success in protecting Mother Nature.\u201d Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray said, \u201cMay truth and justice prevail for the ecosystem of Aarey!\u201d", "description": "The Supreme Court ordered status quo in the Aarey tree felling case, and ordered the Maharashtra government not to cut any more trees till the next hearing on O", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/sthaarey1570430801.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
