It seems the department is simultaneously spending both more and less, creating a log-jam.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne source says the cost of the submarines and frigates has become a lot clearer, with the design work costing more than expected.\n\nYet that has not really translated into substantial work trickling down to subcontractors and other suppliers, with the French submarine designer Naval Group and British frigate builder BAE Systems wanting to keep as much money as close to the foreign parent as possible.\n\n\"It seems there are Australian companies that are guaranteed to be on these platforms and want to make investments but don't have the ink on the paper yet,\" a third industry source says.\n\nDefence chiefs and sailors listen to Defence Minister Linda Reynolds address the Sea Power conference James Alcock\n\nA former bureaucrat now in industry says the Department often relies on slippage \u2013 late delivery of projects \u2013 to shuffle money around. But some, such as P-8 surveillance planes, are arriving on schedule, which poses a challenge for the beancounters.\n\nAustralian Strategic Policy Institute senior analyst Marcus Hellyer, a former senior Defence Department official who advised on acquisitions, says the Department and government have two choices: they can either defer projects or \"salami slice\" them, reducing the number on order.\n\nRenewal of the armoured vehicle fleet is one project that could come under pressure. The government plans to spend up to $15 billion building 400 new infantry fighting vehicles locally to replace the Vietnam War era M-113 armoured personnel carriers, but there is a speculation this could be scaled back.\n\n\"Defence really hates to cancel things,\" Hellyer says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShipbuilding safe\n\nReynolds has indicated that the big shipbuilding programs are likely to survive the department's white paper and defence force posture, which are due early next year.\n\nShe insists the government is committed to the delivery of the shipbuilding program on schedule and within budget.\n\n\"This government has a comprehensive national security agenda and makes affordable capability investment choices based on the highest strategic priorities,\" Reynolds tells AFR Weekend.\n\n\"The government keeps its policy settings under constant review to ensure we can deliver security and defence objectives against shifts in the strategic environment and new technology challenges.\"\n\nHowever, there is some chatter that senior naval chiefs don't expect Naval Group to deliver the full complement of 12 submarines, and might just settle for six to replace the Collins-class boats. The contract between the Commonwealth and Naval Group does offer flexibility, with orders expected to be in batches of three or four.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNavy chief Mike Noonan also left the door open to nuclear propulsion one day being used in the submarines, although Naval Group's advice is that would necessitate totally redesigning the submarine.\n\nThe budgetary headache facing Defence comes as Australia risks being sucked into the maelstrom caused by China's growing assertiveness.\n\nFormer senior bureaucrat Paul Dibb, who authored the seminal 1986 defence white paper, told the Sea Power conference the \"comfortable assumptions\" that a regional neighbour lacked the capability to launch a major assault on Australia were over.\n\nDibb, who did not have to name China as the potential adversary, argues Australia needs higher training levels and a surge capacity in areas such as pilots and submariners, increased stocks of munitions and spare parts, a robust fuel-supply system and upgraded operational bases in the north.\n\n\"Australia\u2019s international security outlook is starting to look very unpredictable and potentially threatening,\" Dibb said in his speech.\n\n\"Our defence planners must now deal with a world which is very different from any they have known before. America is undermining the international rules-based order and, at the same time, China and Russia are becoming increasingly assertive militarily and aligned in their anti-Western attitudes.\n\n\"Any serious review of Australia\u2019s evolving strategic circumstances will come to the conclusion that warning time is becoming shorter and that the management of strategic risk is becoming significantly more demanding.\"", "description": "A budgetary headache looms for Defence Minister Linda Reynolds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1839%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_44/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0417068bdf7d2fb858822f37ac4e45594b725a6b", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
