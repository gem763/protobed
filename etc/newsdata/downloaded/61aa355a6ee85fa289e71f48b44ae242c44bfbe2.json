Reproductive rights organisations have called for the Upper House to pass the legislation without alterations.\n\nEven though it was withdrawn, the spill motion represents a rebuke of a premier who led her embattled party to an election victory in March this year. That\u2019s just what happens when you have the absolute gall to permit your party a conscience vote on a medical procedure, we guess.", "description": "Rebel MPs say they secured assurances she will back their controversial amendments.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/08/20190801001411411673-original-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
