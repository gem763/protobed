He knows exactly how to plan for it,\" Sage said.\n\n\"You can expect a lot of changes to the squad leading up to the Asian Champions League.\n\n\"Some players behind me might not even get a game during the lead-up because the Asian Champions League is what we want to win, and we want to be champions of Asia.\n\n\"Popa's got it all organised, and I think we've got the squad to do it.\"\n\nSage was a relieved man this week after securing BHP as the club's new major sponsor.\n\nThe mining entrepreneur has poured more than $20 million of his own money into the club over the past 12 years, and said the arrival of BHP will ease the burden on him.\n\nSage has been looking to sell off a stake of Perth Glory to new investors in recent times, and said he was currently in discussions with a potential buyer.\n\n\"I've had several discussions with some partners that may come into the club,\" Sage said.\n\n\"But at this stage, nothing that's come to fruition yet.\n\n\"I expect ongoing discussions with the potential partners I've been talking to.\"\n\nSage hopes Glory can reach 12,500 members this year - up from 10,800 last season.\n\nPerth Glory's W-League team are still waiting to see if superstar Sam Kerr returns for next season.\n\nKerr has reportedly been offered huge money to play in Europe next season, but Sage is still holding out some hope the 26-year-old returns.\n\n\"We always leave Sam until the end of her sojourn in America,\" Sage said.\n\n\"She's in finals now over there. She makes her decision at the end of October, as she has every year. We hope she comes back.\n\n\"But look, if you were one of the best female players in the world, you really do want to test (yourself) against the best. So we wouldn't be surprised if she left.\"", "description": "Perth Glory owner Tony Sage is confident his club possesses a squad capable of winning this season's Asian Champions League.Glory qualified for the lucrative...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
