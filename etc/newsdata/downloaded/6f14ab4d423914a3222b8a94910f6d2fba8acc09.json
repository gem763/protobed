The new rules will allow a single tattoo on each hand, with certain restrictions. They will also allow a tattoo on a single finger on each hand, excluding thumbs, as well as chest tattoos, as long as they don\u2019t go past the collar of a dress uniform crew-neck T-shirt.\n\nCoast Guard Master Chief Petty Officer Jason Vanderhaden told the newspaper the new policy adopts some of the same tattoo standards now publicly acceptable.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Virginian-Pilot, http://pilotonline.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
