Photo by iStock. (iStock/iStock)\n\nColumnist\n\nRetirement savings can become all consuming sometimes. Aside from an emergency fund, you may be stashing every dollar you get into a workplace retirement account.\n\nBut some folks don\u2019t like tying up all their extra funds in an account they can\u2019t touch without jumping though some hoops, including the possibility of a 10 percent penalty for early withdrawals.\n\nDuring a recent online chat a reader wanted advice on cutting back from retirement saving to have more flexibility.\n\nSome background: He\u2019s 35 (no age given for the wife). He and his wife have a mortgage and some student loans, which may be forgiven soon. They max out their workplace retirement accounts.\n\nTheir dilemma: \u201cWe have enough money saved in our retirement accounts that if the investments continue to perform as their class has historically (7 percent for stocks) we already have enough saved for retirement 30 years out,\u201d the husband wrote. \u201cI\u2019m contemplating lowering our retirement contributions to receive the match and instead put the money toward non-retirement equity accounts so we have some additional flexibility financially. Definitely not planning on stopping contributing and spending [instead], only trying to optimize our flexibility. What do you ?\u201d\n\nI\u2019d like to address the student loans first. Until I was absolutely sure the loans would be forgiven, I wouldn\u2019t pull back on the retirement contributions just yet to invest, particularly if he\u2019s counting on the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program.\n\nUnder PSLF, the remaining balance of a borrower\u2019s debt is forgiven after 120 qualifying monthly payments. However, many borrowers have discovered they hadn\u2019t been on track for loan forgiveness for various reasons such as not being in the right repayment program. The program has a lot of issues.\n\nRead: New York sues student loan company over debt forgiveness for those in public service\n\nNow about that market return. That too isn\u2019t a sure thing. What if the funds fall short of the expected 7 percent return? Keep in mind past performance is no guarantee of future results. And don\u2019t forget: fees impact returns.\n\nRead: What Rate of Return Should I Expect on My 401(k)?\n\nAnd about feeling you\u2019ll have \u201cenough.\u201d A lot of things can smash right through that optimism, with health care cost being a big drain in retirement.\n\nA study by West Health and Gallup released in April found that seniors withdrew an estimated $22 billion from their long-term savings for health-care-related expenses over the previous 12 months. Ninety-two percent of those 65 or older feel health care costs will stay the same or get worse, Gallup said.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018golden years American seniors anticipate enjoying may require actual gold, or the dollar equivalent, to pay for rising health care costs,\u201d according to a Gallup blog.\n\nRead: Seniors report spending $22 billion from savings to cover health-care costs\n\nThere\u2019s also long-term care costs to consider.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s what it\u2019s like dealing with the high cost of long-term care\n\nSo, what would I do? I would continue maxing out the retirement accounts. However, I do agree that it\u2019s a good idea to have funds that are restricted by some tax rules.\n\nHere\u2019s a helpful guide from NerdWallet: How to Invest Your Savings for Short-Term or Long-Term Goals\n\nIf you can, try to find places in your budget to cut so that you can contribute to an after-tax investment account. If you need the money in five years or less, I wouldn\u2019t invest it. There\u2019s not enough time to weather market volatility. But if you\u2019d like to invest to say, save for a car down the road, or make major home improvements, investing outside of a retirement fund is a good idea.\n\nRead more:\n\nCould you be saving so much for retirement that you\u2019re missing out on living your best life now?\n\nFour pieces of retirement advice you should question\n\nHere\u2019s one of the biggest threats to having enough money in retirement\n\nYour Thoughts\n\nSend your comments to colorofmoney@washpost.com.

My boss and I had a disagreement after my working there for 13 years, so I walked off the job on a Thursday afternoon.

I read two, three, four books a week, belong to a book club, walk my dog twice a day, and watch classic or foreign movies on TV. My social security and a small IRA pay the bills.
