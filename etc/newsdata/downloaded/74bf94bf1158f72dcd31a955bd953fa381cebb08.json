Most recently, the now-58-year-old, along with \u201850s actress Kathleen Hughes, attended The Hollywood Museum to commemorate the life of Ida Lupino, as well as Olivia De Havilland\u2019s 103rd birthday. The former child star is currently the host of a KABC Radio show on Sundays called \u201cSunday Night Live\u201d with Frank Sheftel.\n\nOlsen spoke to Fox News about revisiting the \u201cBrady\u201d home, why she gave up on acting and why she\u2019s not afraid to voice her political beliefs.\n\n'A VERY BRADY BUNCH RENOVATION' REUNITES CAST TO BRING THE ICONIC TV FAMILY HOME BACK TO LIFE\n\nFox News: How does it feel to revisit the \u201cBrady\u201d home\u201d on HGTV?\n\nSusan Olsen: They performed a miracle. And it\u2019s something that would have satisfied the 9-year-old me. As a little girl, I was always interested in architecture\u2026. They contacted us and said they wanted us to be involved with the process\u2026 But they did the impossible \u2013 they recreated that set. And it looks exactly like the same house. People will get to see how that happens in the show \u2014 the decisions that were made, the construction that was going on. And all of us were experts designated to different rooms.\n\nFox News: What\u2019s your relationship like with the other \u201cBrady\u201d kids?\n\nOlsen: We have a ridiculously good relationship. We get along better than we did when we were filming \u201cThe Brady Bunch.\u201d It was a really, really happy time filming that series, but it was also a love/hate relationship for those who wanted to continue acting because there was some typecasting involved. But I think we all learned with time that there\u2019s something really precious about the show. And the truth is, it continues to make people happy.\n\n\u201830S SEX SYMBOL MAE WEST HAS BEEN MISQUOTED FOR DECADES, BOOK REVEALS\n\nSebastian Bach once told me, \u201cDude, you are part of people\u2019s childhoods, but you\u2019re the good part. How could you ever, ever have a problem with that?\u201d And he\u2019s right. I\u2019ve met so many people from over the years who told me the show saved their lives\u2026 It\u2019s just really amazing.\n\n'BRADY BUNCH' CAST REUNITES AT ICONIC TV HOME AMID PLANS FOR HOME-RENOVATION SERIES\n\nFox News: How did you cope with typecasting?\n\nOlsen: I dealt with it by quitting. I left the business. I didn\u2019t want to put up with that. I wanted out of that. And I later realized acting wasn\u2019t really my medium\u2026 I later pursued life as a graphic and fine artist.\n\nFox News: Do you have any memories of your TV parents?\n\nOlsen: It\u2019s funny, we grew up with Florence\u2019s kids. Robert Reed used to let us stay in his house when we were going to be in the Rose Parade. And when I went to the Academy of Dramatic Arts, he wrote my letter of recommendation. Obviously, this was before I gave up on acting. He even offered to let me stay in his home while I went to school there. He really was like a dad. They taught us to always be professional on set and arrive camera-ready.\n\n'LAND OF THE LOST' STAR KATHY COLEMAN RECALLS GETTING INTO TROUBLE ON SET, REVEALS WHY HIT SHOW CAME TO AN END\n\nFox News: How are you keeping busy today?\n\nOlsen: I started doing radio in 1995. In terms of entertainment, it was always my favorite medium because I could just be myself. I wasn\u2019t much of a career woman when I was raising my son. I kind of believe in stay-at-home moms. I know that\u2019s a form of luxury a lot of women can\u2019t afford, so I was incredibly lucky. I did things that weren\u2019t in the limelight but allowed me to be a stay-at -home mom and pay the mortgage *laughs*. But now that he\u2019s 22, I am free. I can work *laughs*.\n\nFox News: What can audiences expect from your current radio show?\n\nOlsen: Well it\u2019s me. And our show is more focused on guests. It\u2019s like joining us at the living room and we have a guest over. And it\u2019s not just the typical celebrities in a room. We like to spend the whole hour getting to really know the person and their lives.\n\n\u2018MARY TYLER MOORE\u2019 STAR ED ASNER SAYS CAST WAS LIKE A FAMILY: \u2018WE FORGAVE EACH OTHER\u2019S FAULTS'\n\nFox News: It\u2019s been said you\u2019re more politically conscious. Are you ever worried that people might think of you differently based on your beliefs?\n\nOlsen: All the time\u2026 I've been the subject of fake news. And it was shocking to me. The story was that I had been fired for a homophobic rant on the air. Yeah, I did rant at a guy, but it was not on the air. And I never got fired. But it was all part of my punishment for admitting that I voted for Trump.\n\nThings being not fair, things being untrue \u2014 I can't put up with it. I\u2019m constantly being told by family members, \u201cSusan, shut up. Don\u2019t speak your opinion.\u201d Because my opinion is not very popular in Hollywood. And I know people who have been completely blacklisted because they\u2019re not on the left\u2026 I'm not even a Republican. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m all that conservative.\n\n\u2018BRADY BUNCH\u2019 CASTMATES ASK FOR FANS' HELP TO FIND ICONIC ITEMS FROM HOME\n\nBut gee, we used to be able to have differences. And if you talked about them, you\u2019d usually find there really isn\u2019t that much difference between the right and the left\u2026 Now people are being called hateful. Betsy Ross is now hateful and she was an abolitionist. The world\u2019s gone nuts!... It\u2019s misinformation. And these people are hypocrites.\n\nFox News: Have you received any kind of backlash recently over your political beliefs?\n\nOlsen: Oh, I\u2019ve said so much worse. But after the fake news bit, I left social media for a couple of years\u2026 It\u2019s just too tempting to try to speak my mind. And it\u2019s funny because I often had people on the other side say things that make me pause and reconsider what my position is\u2026 I try not to be controversial on social media but it\u2019s hard to back away when someone knocks on American values. I really just want to protect them.\n\n\"A Very Brady Renovation\" premieres Sept. 9 at 9 p.m. on HGTV.
