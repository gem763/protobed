Police have said they have not identified any suspects or motives.\n\nBrown, 28, was killed on Friday, just three days after a jury convicted Amber Guyger of murder for fatally shooting her upstairs neighbor, Botham Jean, in September 2018. Guyger testified that, after working a long shift, she mistook Jean\u2019s apartment for her own and thought he was a burglar. She was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nAt the time of Jean\u2019s shooting, Brown lived in the same apartment building as Guyger and Jean. Authorities say Brown was killed at a different complex.\n\nBrown testified that on the night of Jean\u2019s killing, he was in a hallway on the fourth floor, where he and Jean lived, and that he heard what sounded like \u201ctwo people meeting by surprise\u201d and then two gunshots.\n\nAt times during his testimony, Brown became emotional and used his T-shirt and tissue to wipe away tears. He said he had met Jean, a 26-year-old accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia, for the first time earlier that day.\n\nA Jean family attorney, Lee Merritt, posted a statement on Twitter that said he had spoken with Brown\u2019s mother and \u201cshe is devastated.\u201d\n\nJudge Tammy Kemp, who presided over Guyger\u2019s trial, said Monday that she was \u201csaddened\u201d and \u201cstunned\u201d to hear about Brown\u2019s death, adding that \u201che seemed to be a very compassionate young man and I hate that his life has ended so soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that we need to let the investigation of his death go forward,\u201d Kemp told The Associated Press during her first interview since last week\u2019s verdict.\n\nU.S. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson likewise said the city police must be allowed to do their work and that she \u201cwill keep a very close eye on the Brown investigation and all aspects of this terrible crime.\u201d\n\nBrown testified that he was from Jacksonville, Florida, and had moved to Texas in 2008 before he left to attend the University of South Florida, where he played football from 2012 to 2013, according to the Dallas Morning News .\n\n\u201cJoshua was a much loved and valued member of our football program and athletic family and his loss is felt by many whose lives he positively touched,\u201d USF said in a statement. \u201cOur hearts go out to Joshua\u2019s family, friends and loved ones during this very difficult time.\u201d\n\nLast year, Brown was shot in the foot and a 25-year-old man was killed in a shooting outside of a nightclub, the newspaper reported.\n\nMerritt told CBS News that after that shooting, Brown was concerned that someone was after him.\n\n\u201cHe was reluctant to testify in this case because he had been shot at and he thought some people might want to do harm to him,\u201d Merritt said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dallas' mayor has asked the public to avoid speculating about the fatal shooting of a witness in the recent trial of a former police officer who was convicted of murder in the killing of her upstairs neighbor.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/dallas_officer_mistaken_apartment_witness_72920_c0-606-6519-4406_s1770x1032.jpg?e1ef705e0d14c008262a3f34318646379e119092", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
