But after he was spotted on Saturday stumbling down the streets of West Hollywood in a video released by TMZ, the rumour mill swirled that the actor may have fallen off the wagon.\n\nOn Monday the 47-year-old addressed the concerns over his sobriety, admitting his \"slip\" when he was photographed arriving outside Jennifer Garner's home.\n\n\"Well, you know, it happens,\" he told paparazzi. \"It's a slip, but I'm not going to let it derail me.\"\n\nA source close to the star told People, \"Sobriety is difficult and elusive for everyone struggling with addiction. Ben has acknowledged he's going to slip up from time to time. It was never as if this was simply behind him.\"\n\nAccording to E! News, the Gone Girl actor wasn't alone when he was partying in Hollywood over the weekend. He also sparked dating rumours when he was spotted with musician Katie Cherry. He addressed those rumours before he was spotted though.\n\n\"HA, you got me. I'm dating,\" he said on Instagram, before shedding light on a very important cause.\n\n\"But let's be serious for a moment and talk about something that is actually important. I have been in recovery for over a year and part of that is helping out others. @themidnightmission is an incredible organization that helps those in need with housing, training, development and recovery. I'm making a donation today because there are people battling addiction every day that don't have the resources and need help.\"\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)", "description": "Ben Affleck breaks his silence following concerns over his sobriety after he was spotted stumbling down the streets of West Hollywood.", "authors": ["Bashiera Parker", "Bparks_"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8402/d448b943e5794534ada913dec512a038.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
