Minnesota has lost 16 consecutive postseason games, matching the North American major sports record held by the Chicago Blackhawks in the NHL from 1975-79.\n\nFollowing a 103-win regular season and its first AL title since 2012, New York, starts the AL Championship Series on Saturday, at home against Tampa Bay or at Houston.\n\nAL Central champion Minnesota became the first 100-win team swept in the Division Series. The Twins are 2-16 against the Yankees in the playoffs since the 2004 ALDS opener. Outscored 23-7 in the series, they batted just .218 and after hitting a record 307 homers had just four in the Division Series, all solo shots.\n\nYankees starter Luis Severino pitched out of trouble for four scoreless innings in just his fourth big league appearance after recovering from a spring training lat injury. Chad Green, the third of five relievers, got four outs for the win.\n\nGregorius went 4 for 10 with six RBIs in the series. Dating to the 2017 wild card game, he\u2019s 23 for 50 with seven homers and 33 RBIs in just 14 games against the Twins, who became the first 100-win team in history to be swept in a division series.\n\nEddie Rosario went 3 for 4 for the Twins with a homer to lead off the eighth off Zack Britton, who was limping a bit after covering first base on a grounder two batters earlier and left in the eighth with assistance from head athletic trainer Steve Donahue. Yankees relievers allowed three runs over 13 1/3 innings, in the series.\n\nOn this idyllic fall evening that started at 62 degrees, the Twins trotted out Torii Hunter for the ceremonial first pitch to fellow retired fan favorite Joe Mauer, and the sellout crowd of 41,121 for the first postseason game at Target Field since the ballpark\u2019s 2010 debut was buzzing.\n\nThe energy hardly ever deflated, even when the 22-year-old Torres became the fifth-youngest Yankees player to register a postseason homer in when he took Twins starter Jake Odorizzi deep. The ball barely cleared the dark green wall in left-center.\n\nTypifying this long-running lopsided matchup, almost all the could-go-either-way plays went to the Yankees, leaving the Twins largely shaking their heads at all their near misses.\n\nRosario hit what he thought was a homer to start the bottom of the second, stopping to admire the trajectory for a second, but the ball bounced off the 23-foot right field wall for a double. The Twins loaded the bases with nobody out, but Severino escaped with a pop-up and a pair of strikeouts. Jake Cave went down looking to end the inning, and in the top of the third his ill-advised, no-chance dive for a line drive by Gio Urshela that went for a double.\n\nSure enough, with two outs, after Miguel San\u00f3 had just shifted to his left, Brett Gardner chopped a single into the vacated space past the burly third baseman\u2019s outstretched glove for a 2-0 lead. D.J. LeMahieu, batting immediately after Urshela, grounded out with a ball that would\u2019ve been primed for a double play.\n\nA few setbacks for the Twins were out of their hands. With runners at first and third, Mitch Garver took what appeared to be ball four on a 3-0 pitch by Severino, but plate umpire Gary Cederstrom called it a strike. Garver whiffed to end that inning, and the Twins left a total of nine runners on base while going 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position.\n\nThe Yankees were impeccable in the field. LeMahieu made a slick leaping catch of a sharp line drive by Marwin Gonzalez to end the fourth. Torres, employing an aggressive shift at second base that had him in shallow right field, scooped a sharp grounder by Rosario with two on in the fifth and managed to throw him out from his knees to end the inning. Torres again came up big again in the seventh with a stop on a Jorge Polanco grounder and flip to Britton covering first.\n\nLanky right fielder Aaron Judge made a jumping catch on the warning track of a smash by San\u00f3 after a double by Luis Arraez in the sixth. Gregorius made a diving snag of fellow shortstop Polanco\u2019s drive for the second out of the ninth, with two runners on, flashing a big smile after throwing the ball around the horn.\n\nSeverino, who didn\u2019t make his 2019 debut until Sept. 17, threw a first-pitch ball to 11 of the 17 batters he faced, including all six in the second inning. He finished four scoreless innings, though, a far better output than his wild card game start against the Twins in 2017 when he fell behind 3-0 and was yanked after one out.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nBritton faced 67 left-handed batters in the regular season without allowing a home run. \u2026 According to MLB\u2019s Statcast data, Rosario\u2019s double in the second was the third-highest extra-base hit in baseball in 2019, a pitch 4.22 feet above the ground. \u2026 The Twins ranked just 26th in the majors with a .217 batting average with the bases loaded during the regular season. \u2026 San\u00f3 went 1 for 12 with eight strikeouts in the series. \u2026 Odorizzi took the loss. \u2026 The Twins went 1 for 12 with runners in scoring position with 11 men left on base in the game, finishing 3 for 28 in the series with 25 runners stranded.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nYankees: With their optimal lineup finally available after an onslaught of injuries all season long, manager Aaron Boone used an identical batting order for the third straight time. The only other time this year he did so in three straight games was from Sept. 6-8.\n\n\u201cI do like the work and the flow we have right now. Obviously, it\u2019s a little more healthier group than we\u2019ve been,\u201d Boone said. \u201cSo kind of have that luxury of rolling them out in some similar spots.\u201d\n\nTwins: Manager Rocco Baldelli wrote his lineup with Cave in RF, Marwin Gonzalez at 1B and C.J. Cron on the bench. Cron, who pinch hit for Cave in the seventh inning, battled a sore thumb for most of the summer, but Baldelli said Cron was \u201cdefinitely available\u201d and not held out for health reasons.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Gleyber Torres got New York going with a second-inning home run, scored on each of his two doubles and made a pair of sparkling defensive plays, fueling the Yankees to a 5-1 victory over Minnesota on Monday night to finish yet another sweep of the Twins and advance to the AL Championship Series.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Campbell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/alds_yankees_twins_baseball_17133_c0-166-3982-2487_s1770x1032.jpg?ca593f4491d079764248fc7ff0a96126a1973a82", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
