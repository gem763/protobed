And that promises to keep lenders very, very busy, particularly as homeowners spot opportunities to cut their monthly payments by refinancing.\n\nBorrowers haven't seen rates this low since the fall of 2016, and here's what's really stunning: Mortgage rates are down almost 1.5 percentage points from where they were a year ago.\n\nIf you see a good rate, don't let it get away.

Refinance applications surged 10% last week and were up a jaw-dropping 163% from a year earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Central bank policymakers on Wednesday released the minutes from their September meeting, when they cut rates. The notes indicate officials are divided on whether to reduce rates again this year.\n\nIn the meantime, the housing market is humming along, says Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist.\n\n\u201cThe 50-year low in the unemployment rate combined with low mortgage rates has led to increased homebuyer demand this year,\" Khater says. \"Much of this strength is coming from entry-level buyers.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "Rates are at their lowest levels since a month ago.", "authors": ["Doug Whiteman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gjjDmf_7_tgqOL7s9XoMMQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/moneywise_327/500d07226de55ac94b90025516e80354", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
