Many flights to and from Haneda for Sunday have already been canceled, while operations of Tokyo's subways were initially suspended in the early morning hours for safety checks.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency had issued the highest warning on its one-to-five scale for Tokyo and the prefectures of Gunma, Saitama, Kanagawa, Yamanashi, Nagano, Shizuoka, Niigata, Fukushima, Tochigi, Ibaraki, Miyagi and Iwate.\n\nSome dam operators have authorized water releases as an emergency measure to avoid possible dam bursting, a move that could raise the amount of water further downstream where rivers are already overflowing.\n\nA tornado hit parts of Ichihara, Chiba Prefecture, destroying 12 houses and damaging more than 70 others.\n\nLocal officials said a man in his 50s was found dead in an overturned car, as the tornado likely caused his vehicle to roll over.\n\nIn Tomioka, Gunma Prefecture, a man died after houses were swept away by a landslide, police said. In Kawasaki, southwest of Tokyo, a man in his 60s was found in an inundated apartment and confirmed dead at a hospital.\n\nIn Tochigi, a woman who fell into a waterway was found and confirmed dead, while a woman in Sagamihara near Tokyo died after a landslide swept her house away.\n\nIn Chiba, which was hit by widespread power outages in September due to another strong typhoon, over 100,000 houses were without power as of 10 a.m., according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. More than 100,000 other homes elsewhere in its service area were affected by power outages.\n\nTohoku Electric Power Co, serving northeastern Japan, said over 28,000 homes were without electricity.\n\nAs of 9 a.m. Sunday, Typhoon Hagibis, meaning \"swift\" in the Philippine language Tagalog, was traveling off Japan's northeastern coast and moving away from the Japanese archipelago after sweeping through the Tokyo metropolitan area and parts of northeastern Japan.\n\nIt is expected to weaken to an extratropical cyclone by Sunday afternoon.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "At least nine people have died, and another 14 are missing as a massive typhoon lashed Japan, including the Tokyo metropolitan area on Saturday, with many rivers overflowing into residential areas across a wide area of the country.
