And I\u2019m not \u2013 I don\u2019t think \u2013 a misery tourist.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nTo many in Britain, the word Balkans conjures up brutalist, rotting tower blocks, tragic histories and intractable wars. On a recent trip back to London from Sarajevo, where I\u2019m currently based, I was asked more than once whether I had \u201cbecome a war correspondent\u201d.\n\nBut so much time has elapsed since the conflicts of the early Nineties, and the Balkans \u2013 bar the more obvious destinations like Dubrovnik and Split \u2013 have the potential to bring a lot more joy to tourists.\n\nThe landscape that made Sarajevo so vulnerable to siege now makes it one of the most beautiful capital cities on Earth. It\u2019s a city of twinkly hills, stunning minarets and imposing Austro-Hungarian architecture. And yes, there is sadness behind the clich\u00e9s of a mini Istanbul, of East meets West \u2013 ethnic politics mean that, while mosques and churches still stand side by side, the country is becoming more segregated. But there\u2019s also the simple joy of exchange. Unlike in more obvious tourist destinations, the people of Bosnia genuinely want to tell you their stories, and hear yours in return. Political torpor aside, there\u2019s still a feistiness to the city, a terribly dark sense of humour, a real readiness to laugh and pour another rakia in the face of catastrophe.\n\nAlbania may score lower than occupied Palestine in the World Happiness Index, but you don\u2019t get that impression on the ground. Some of my fondest travel memories come from this mysterious country \u2013 isolated almost entirely from the world under Enver Hoxha\u2019s dictatorship. I remember staying for a week in a fortress (Kruje Castle) eating home-cooked food every evening within the fifth-century walls. Further north, in the mountains of Theth (one of the best undiscovered hiking destinations in Europe), I was happily foiled in my attempts to go walking by a local family who summoned me over to drink their homemade rakia, explained the history of the Accursed Mountains, then introduced me to the neighbours.\n\nThere\u2019s something about the Balkan countryside which moves me in a way the ordered hillsides of Tuscany or the famous vistas in the south of France never could. The little-known train route from Bar, on Montenegro\u2019s Adriatic coast, to Belgrade is one of the most stunning train journeys I have ever taken. Spanning 12 hours, 435 bridges and 254 tunnels, I found myself sitting in an old-fashioned dining car, feeling like a character in a Cold War film. And I defy anyone to take a train in the Balkans without being offered half your carriage mate\u2019s picnic and a few stories, whether spoken or mimed.\n\nOf course there is always the danger of romanticising places too much. These countries have deep, ingrained problems, which explain their rankings on the World Happiness Index: strikingly high youth unemployment, extravagant political corruption and, in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Dayton Agreement \u2013 which ended the war but has made political progress almost impossible.\n\nHowever, as the value of the pound falls and cities such as Venice and Barcelona experience chronic overcrowding, the appeal of the Balkans can only grow. The joy here isn\u2019t to be found in ticking off the obvious. Yes, there will usually be a tower block peeping out of your photos. Yes, the provision for vegetarians sometimes involves the chef picking the meat bits out of the stew. No, you won\u2019t find many boutique hotels to check into on Foursquare.\n\nBut these countries free your mind and allow you to experience joy in a way that obvious destinations simply don\u2019t. Because you\u2019ll come without preconceptions, meet some of the least dour people on the planet.", "description": "Balkan countries fare badly in this year\u2019s UN World Happiness Report, prompting a rather memorable headline in the regional press: \u201cBalkans Not Very Joyful, says the UN\u201d.\u00a0 The two worst Balkan offenders were Bosnia and Herzegovina in 93rd position \u2013\u00a0ranking well below Libya and dictatorships such as Turkmenistan and Belarus \u2013\u00a0and Albania which, in 112th position, narrowly", "authors": ["Sophie Buchan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/15/17/balkans-1.jpg"}
