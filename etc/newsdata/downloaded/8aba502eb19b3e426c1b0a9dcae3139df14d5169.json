The U.S.-U.K. alliance is the most powerful and effective bilateral partnership in modern times, and I welcome the strengthening of those ties under such an incredibly pro-American prime minister.\n\n\"The U.S.-UK Special Relationship has been the engine of free trade, security, and stability in the world for more than 75 years. The free world is a better and far safer place when Britain and America stand together. From standing up to Putin\u2019s regime in Russia to helping to tackle Iran\u2019s aggressions, to keeping the NATO alliance strong and working towards a U.S.-U.K. free trade agreement, we have many issues our nations can work on together. The Heritage Foundation looks forward to working towards a U.S.-UK free trade agreement and building upon the critical defense and intelligence relationships which our two nations share.\"", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Heritage President Kay Coles James released the following statement Tuesday upon Boris Johnson's selection as the next British prime minister:", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
