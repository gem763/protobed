My mom had a C-section before and she knew it wasn\u2019t normal,\" she explained.\n\nPraise said that when she felt down near her incision, she felt blisters across her abdomen, which caused her to panic. She said she rushed to the doctor\u2019s office and while they offered to drain the blisters, she knew she needed to get to a hospital.\n\n\u201cThere was so much pus and dead flesh oozing out of me,\u201d Praise told the news outlet. \u201cI was shocked.\u201d\n\nPost-C-section infections are typically caused by a bacterial infection in the incision site.

She said she spent two weeks fighting for her life, during which she could not see her son.\n\n\u201cI was so sad,\u201d she said, of her time away from her infant. \u201cThe first time you\u2019re ever having a baby it\u2019s supposed to be this really happy exciting time, then all of a sudden everything around that is sad and scary.\u201d\n\nThe woman revealed that she has not yet completely recovered from the ordeal, but that she continues to heal and was happy to be reunited with her baby.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nPraise said her ordeal should serve as a message to other new moms to speak up when they feel ill or need help.\n\n\u201cHad I waited a day later I could have died, it was eating at my insides,\u201d she told JamPress.", "description": "\u201cThere was so much pus and dead flesh oozing out of me,\u201d Praise said. \u201cI was shocked.\u201d", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Krista-Parise-2-JAM-Press.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
