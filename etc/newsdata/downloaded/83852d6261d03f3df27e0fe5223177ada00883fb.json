Trump whistleblower seeks protection from retaliation", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 As the House and Senate intelligence committees prepare for hearings with the whistleblower who complained about President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, the negotiations focused attention on how Congress protects anonymous witnesses.\n\nThe intelligence panels routinely hold closed meetings with unannounced witnesses. Other committees have accepted anonymous testimony about issues such as foreign affairs or drug use. In rare circumstances, steps to protect the witnesses included placing them behind screens and altering their voices electronically.\n\nThose steps aren\u2019t foolproof: An IRS whistleblower ran into her supervisor on the way to a hearing and blew her cover. The stakes are high for the Ukraine whistleblower, whose career relies on anonymity and who fears retaliation. Trump has said he\u2019s trying to identify the person.\n\nAndrew Bakaj, a former CIA officer who represents the whistleblower, tweeted Monday that the person \u201cis entitled to anonymity. Law and policy support this and the individual is not to be retaliated against. Doing so is a violation of federal law.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint is at the heart of the impeachment investigation of Trump at the House of Representatives. The complaint filed Aug. 12 alleged Trump abused the power of his office when he urged Ukraine's president to gather dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump's political rival. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced a formal impeachment investigation based on news reports about the complaint.\n\nThe intelligence committees haven\u2019t described how they will conduct the hearings. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers need to obtain security clearances. Schiff voiced concerns on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday about congressional Republican contacts with the White House after Trump compared the sources who informed the whistleblower to spies.\n\n\u201cThis is serious business here,\u201d Schiff said. The panel is determining the logistics \u201cto do everything humanly possible\u201d to protect the whistleblower\u2019s identity, which is \u201cour paramount concern here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe top Republican on the panel, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, said the whistleblower inquiry should have been handled behind closed doors without unending news releases promoting \u201cfake news\" that he called a \u201cgrotesque spectacle\u201d and a \u201ccharade.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee treats whistleblower testimony the same as any confidential or secret information, meaning that a staffer would be fired for disclosing information without authorization. The director of national intelligence's general counsel has extended whistleblower protections to \"disclosures made to the congressional intelligence committees,\" so long as the disclosures are made in a secure space.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a co-founder of the Senate Whistleblower Caucus, said the whistleblower deserves to be heard and protected.\n\n\u201cWe should always work to respect whistleblowers\u2019 requests for confidentiality,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cNo one should be making judgments or pronouncements without hearing from the whistleblower first and carefully following up on the facts. Uninformed speculation wielded by politicians or media commentators as a partisan weapon is counterproductive and doesn\u2019t serve the country.\u201d\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., says security for the whistleblower is More\n\nAnonymous witnesses\n\nClosed hearings and anonymous witnesses are common before the intelligence panels. The House Intelligence Committee will have a closed hearing Friday with Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, who deemed the whistleblower credible. As a rule, the Senate Intelligence Committee, which met in private with Atkinson last week, doesn\u2019t announce the witnesses for its closed hearings.", "description": "House and Senate intelligence panels prepare to protect the whistleblower from possible retaliation for a complaint about Trump's Ukraine dealings.", "authors": ["Bart Jansen", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x0tqpvAhxfTl0SEoQ7opew--~B/aD0zNTIxO3c9NTA0OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/a45a9fdafa8629f41364e1bc450f4784", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
