She\u2019s spent a lot of her time away from the game trying to help a family friend, Jonathan Irons, get his conviction overturned.\n\nIrons has been incarcerated since 1997 after he was convicted in the nonfatal shooting of a homeowner during a burglary. He\u2019s serving a 50-year sentence but has asked a judge to reopen his case and will have an evidentiary hearing on Oct. 9 in Missouri. Moore, who plans to be in the courtroom next month, said there was no physical evidence - no DNA, fingerprints or footprints - linking Irons to the crime.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Jonathan for over a decade, and I\u2019m fighting to make sure his case gets a fair review. I\u2019m trying to call attention to the prosecutorial misconduct that I believe resulted in his being wrongfully sent to prison for 50 years as a teenager,\u201d Moore told The Associated Press in a phone interview Sunday night. \u201cThis hearing will hopefully give us a perfect opportunity to show why this conviction lacks integrity for so many different reasons.\u201d\n\nMoore has kept a low profile during her time away from basketball. She had done only one interview , talking to the New York Times over the course of a few months to chronicle Irons\u2019 story.\n\nIrons, then 16, had been seen in O\u2019Fallon, Missouri - a suburb of St. Louis - on the evening of Jan, 14, 1997, with a gun, according to court records cited by the Times. The victim returned home and confronted a burglar, the records said. Shots were fired and the victim was hit in the right temple. A week later, Irons was arrested. The detective in the case said Irons confessed, but the detective wasn\u2019t available to be cross-examined at trial because he was ill. He has since died.\n\nMoore spent time over the weekend in Washington speaking to the Congressional Black Caucus. She started a petition on Change.org to further spread the word about Irons.\n\n\u201cMaya\u2019s petition has become one of the fastest-growing petitions on the site this week, as thousands of people respond to her call for a fair trial for Jonathan Irons, and a fairer justice system for all Americans,\u201d said Michael Jones, managing director of Change.org.\n\nMoore, who turned 30 this summer, also started a social action campaign called Win With Justice . She hopes it will call attention to the power wielded by prosecutors and their obligation to use it responsibly.\n\n\u201cHopefully this will educate people to do something when they feel doomed and get outraged,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWhile it\u2019s hard for people to grasp the 10,000 people who are wrongfully convicted of serious crimes each year, Jonathan\u2019s case helps bring it down for people to connect with. You can connect with one man\u2019s story.\u201d\n\nBy taking time away from basketball, Moore said she\u2019s been able to dive into things that she\u2019s wanted to do for a long time. She\u2019s spent more time with her mom in Atlanta and with her ministry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been engaged in so many meaningful things,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been full with family and ministry things. When you invest in something for so long and you stop and have nothing to fill that space, it can be more of a crisis of identity. For sure I miss the people I didn\u2019t get to spend every day with this year that otherwise I would have.\u201d\n\nAs far as returning to the basketball court, Moore said she\u2019s still uncertain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll figure it out when the time\u2019s right. Definitely not thinking about it right now. There\u2019s so much on my plate to prioritize. When I released the Player\u2019s Tribune article I said I wanted to take a full year. I won\u2019t be a pro basketball player for a year. Maybe sometime this spring I\u2019ll figure out what\u2019s next. For now I\u2019m trying to be in the moment. It\u2019s a wild journey I\u2019m on. Trying to take it literally one week at a time.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug Feinberg on Twitter at https://twitter.com/DougFeinberg\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-Sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Maya Moore shocked the basketball world when she stepped away from the WNBA earlier this year before the season began.
