Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.) voiced objections to funneling disaster aid money to immigration enforcement. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images immigration DHS to siphon $155M in disaster aid to bolster immigration enforcement\n\nThe Trump administration plans to divert $271 million from various Department of Homeland Security accounts to beef up funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including $155 million in federal disaster aid.\n\nIn a recent letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.) said the administration hasn\u2019t provided an adequate justification for funneling money from FEMA\u2019s disaster fund to an account that supports facilities for immigration court proceedings.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe administration also plans to shift $116 million to pay for more detention beds, Sen. Jon Tester of Montana said in a similar letter.\n\nTester, the ranking Democrat on the Senate subcommittee that funds DHS, said the administration plans to pull funds from the Coast Guard, TSA and Customs and Border Protection to expand detention capacity, potentially hampering \u201cpassenger and cargo inspections at the border during peak travel times,\u201d in addition to causing other problems.\n\nRoybal-Allard, who chairs the House Homeland Security spending panel, said the move would come \u201cdespite a significant reduction in single adults crossing the border since early June.\u201d\n\nMorning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Nearly $10 million was diverted from FEMA at the start of hurricane season, sparking congressional backlash.\n\nThe federal government has already spent hundreds of billions of dollars in recent years to help states and territories recover from record-breaking storms. Puerto Rico declared a state emergency on Tuesday, with Tropical Storm Dorian threatening to reach hurricane strength.\n\nTed Hesson contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "The administration made a similar move last year when it redirected $200 million from various DHS accounts into ICE.", "authors": ["Caitlin Emma"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/63/fa/120af00f41ec9f4a76ffe642a57b/190827-roybal-allard-gty-773.jpg"}
