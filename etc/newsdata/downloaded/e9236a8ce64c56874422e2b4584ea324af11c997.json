She lost her job in 2017 after Rose was fired by PBS and CBS News for sexual misconduct.\n\nHer lawsuit seeks unspecified damages \"and equitable relief for the harm she has endured,\" it says.\n\nRiggi charges that Rose treated his studio as a sexual hunting ground for attractive young women. She says he groped and pawed female staff members, stared at their breasts, and dangled job prospects to wine and dine women.\n\nTV News anchor Charlie Rose walks through the Trump Tower, Monday, Nov. 21, 2016 in New York.

But he told Variety that Rose denied the charges and would vigorously contest them. The lawsuit was inconsistent with friendly messages that Riggi had sent to Rose, he said.\n\nRiggi said Rose would demean and humiliate women who rejected him and once swatted at her. Many women who were shaken by encounters by Rose would use her makeup room as a refuge, she said.", "description": "Gina Riggi alleged that Charlie Rose groped and pawed female staff members, stared at their breasts, and dangled job prospects to wine and dine women.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d86bd592e22af337f29a683-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
