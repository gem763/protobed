The order, which comes in response to a petition by Charter, finds that AT&T\u2019s TV Now streaming service qualifies as reasonable competition for conventional cable, opening the door to a massive deregulation in monopoly cable markets.\n\nUnder the Cable Act of 1992, local regulators are permitted to regulate cable prices in markets with only one provider. The provision is meant to prevent cable companies from leveraging that monopoly power to set unfairly high rates. When a new cable company comes to town, providers can file a petition to have those regulations removed.\n\nCharter\u2019s case centered on a small group of territories in Massachusetts and Hawaii, but Charter\u2019s new competition wasn\u2019t coming from a competing cable TV service. Instead, Charter argued that AT&T\u2019s streaming service, combined with the company\u2019s existing broadband offering, made up a close enough substitute for cable TV that Charter no longer counted as a local monopoly. Despite opposition from both Massachusetts and Hawaii state governments, the FCC ultimately agreed, leaving Charter free to raise its cable rates.\n\n\u201cToday, the FCC paved the way for a powerful cable company to increase its prices\u201d\n\nAs the FCC put it in a statement, cable rates can be deregulated wherever \u201can online streaming service option with comparable programming is available from an LEC affiliate in the franchise area.\u201d In this case, the FCC decided that AT&T\u2019s TV Now service met that definition.\n\nLEC refers to \u201clocal exchange carrier,\u201d a regulatory term for the telephone and cable providers that fall under the purview of the FCC. Charter\u2019s legal gambit only works if the competition is coming from another LEC, which makes it hard for Netflix or Hulu to be presented as competitive. But with AT&T, Comcast, and other telecoms now launching their own streaming services, the argument can be applied far more broadly.\n\nCharter explicitly confirmed that it would raise prices if the petition was successful, which many saw as proof that the streaming service was not truly competitive. \u201cCharter\u2019s acknowledgement of the immediate, substantial rate increases that deregulation would produce makes clear that DIRECTV NOW [later rebranded as AT&T TV Now] does not provide any competitive check on Charter\u2019s rates,\u201d the state of Hawaii argued in its filing.\n\nSen. Ed Markey (D-MA) also sent a letter urging the FCC to deny the petition, arguing that labeling streaming services as a remedy for cable monopolies would set a bad precedent for future cases.\n\n\u201cIn considering non-cable offerings in this context, the Commission would effectively authorize analysis of \u201cover-the-top\u201d online video services in effective competition proceedings,\u201d Markey wrote. \u201cWhile the marketplace for video content has shifted considerably in recent years, your obligation to work in the best interest of the public remains today.\u201d\n\nAfter the order came through, Markey sent out a follow-up statement decrying its impact. \u201cToday,\u201d Markey wrote, \u201cthe FCC paved the way for a powerful cable company to increase its prices without regard to the impact on consumers.\u201d\n\nUpdate 3:56PM ET: Updated with new comment from Sen. Markey.", "description": "Charter argued that AT&T\u2019s TV Now streaming service is a competitor to cable, and it should be allowed to raise prices.
