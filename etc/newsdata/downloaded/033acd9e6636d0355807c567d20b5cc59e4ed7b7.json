And the company used this opportunity to announce an update to its home awareness product, Nest Aware.\n\nIf you have Nest security cameras, you can subscribe to a Nest Aware plan. It currently costs $5 a month for 5-day video history, $10 per month for 10-day history and $30 per month for 30-day history. All plans include continuous recording, intelligence alerts, clips and more.\n\nBut it can get complicated when you have multiple cameras. Additional cameras require their own subscription plan, but those additional plans are a bit cheaper.\n\nGoogle is going to simplify all that with plans that cover your whole home. New plans will cost $6 per month for 30-day event history and $12 per month for 60-day event history as well as 10-day 24/7 video history.\n\nAs you can see, you now have to pay $12 per month for continuous recording as the basic plan doesn\u2019t include continuous recording anymore. But if you have 8 cameras, you\u2019ll only have to play for a single subscription.\n\nNew plans will roll out in early 2020 with the option to switch to the new plans.\n\nAnd now, Nest Mini and Nest Hubs integrate with Nest Aware. For instance, when your non-connected smoke detector is triggered by a fire, your Nest Mini will notice the alarm and send you a push notification.\n\nYou can listen live to confirm that it is a smoke alarm. You can confirm the alarm and the Home app then calls 911 or your local emergency service directly.", "description": "Google is updating the Nest Mini today, the device formerly known as Google Home Mini.
