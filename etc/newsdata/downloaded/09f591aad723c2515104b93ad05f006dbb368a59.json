At a certain point there must be clarity. A good reason is needed for a new delay. What? It is difficult to say categorically.\n\n\u201cYou have to see the context and see if there is a realistic expectation that this will lead to a follow-up phase. But so far, the British have not presented an alternative to the Brexit agreement that is already in place.\u201d\n\nKaag was speaking as figures from The Hague revealed companies from the United Kingdom had substantially increased their investments in the Netherlands in the last year, to a total of \u20ac80bn compared with \u20ac14bn in 2016.\n\nThe UK is now the largest investor in the Netherlands. In contrast, Dutch companies divested \u20ac11bn over the last year, compared with an investment of \u20ac50bn in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe business case for Brexit is still not well-founded,\u201d Kaag said. \u201cPeople cast their votes based on an emotion or assessment without socio-economic grounds. The evidence was ignored. The damage is now clear. I think it\u2019s dramatic.\u201d\n\nThe minister warned that the EU\u2019s patience over the UK\u2019s prevarication would not last forever given the impact on the bloc\u2019s ability to steer its own way forward.\n\nKaag said: \u201cIt is always better if you have your house in order and can say: now we are going to get involved with the Americans or prepare ourselves better for the negative consequences of the trade war between the US and China. Brexit always detracts from that.\u201d", "description": "Sigrid Kaag throws further doubt on Boris Johnson\u2019s claim he is seeking new deal with Brussels", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c53ef3442e02d70d925d338ab7d4a344f42f3b0/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ba7c5801b7a240e783fb5fd1cd8bfa4b", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
