Or he is now showing his true colours and is just an ordinary politician after all.\"\n\n\"I think it might be a mix of both.\"\n\nHow big are the protests?\n\nThe demonstrations have been among the biggest anti-government rallies since 1998 when protests brought down the Suharto dictatorship.\n\nTens of thousands have taken to the streets across the country with Jakarta being only one focal point.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Police fired tear gas and water cannon on Tuesday at demonstrators outside the Indonesian parliament\n\nMany of the marches ended in clashes with the police using tear gas and water cannons against protesters throwing stones and petrol bombs.\n\nOfficials said on Thursday that hundreds of students were arrested after the previous night had again seen street battles in downtown Jakarta.\n\nSeveral hundred are thought to have been injured over the past days in Jakarta alone.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nMost observers expect the unrest to continue.\n\nThe protesters are demanding the new law on corruption to be repealed but the government so far has refused to do so.\n\nThe vote on the reform of the penal code along with laws on mining, land and labour has for now been postponed, but many fear the new bills might just be passed next month.\n\nAll eyes are on President Jokowi, who earlier this year was elected for a second term and will be sworn in on 20 October.\n\n\"The ball is now in court of the president,\" says Mr Hanan. \"There is a lot of anger among the public with many people feeling betrayed.\"\n\n\"They see him as turning his back on the people - after they'd been very loyal to him.\"\n\nReporting by the BBC's Andreas Illmer.", "description": "The violent protests are about corruption, blasphemy and a draconian new criminal code.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0BE7/production/_108974030_db58d57c-ce9d-4594-a7b2-fc5e45180370.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
