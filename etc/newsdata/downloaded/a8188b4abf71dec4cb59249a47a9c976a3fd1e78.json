It has a stainless steel bezel, buttons and rear case with a silicone band for the most comfortable sport fit, all in classic black. The scratch-resistant sapphire lens means it will withstand your toughest workouts and outdoor activities.\n\nFor tracking day-to-day workouts, the Fenix 5 is more than equipped to help you take your athletic performance to the next level. It automatically tracks heart rate, your steps, sleep and calories burned, basically all the stats you\u2019ve come to expect from any kind of smartwatch or fitness tracker.\n\nWhat sets the Fenix 5 apart is its ability to monitor the aerobic and anaerobic effects of your workouts. The VO2 max estimator calculates the maximum volume of oxygen you can consume during exercise, and from this data can predict potential race finish times. There\u2019s also a recovery advisor, with a recovery timer. Runners will love the in-depth analytics on performance condition, lactate threshold, cadence and stride length.\n\nFor a slightly more entry-level purchase into the world of smartwatches, we suggest the Garmin Instinct, also on sale on Amazon.com for $234.69 from its original $299.99 price tag. Available in a range of sporty shades, the Instinct is also designed to withstand the toughest training conditions, matching military standards for thermal, shock and water resistance.\n\nIt boasts a built-in 3-axis compass, barometric altimeter and multiple global navigation satellite systems, not just GPS, for the most accurate location tracking.\n\nLike the Fenix 5, this is the watch we\u2019d take to trek mountains in a remote area but even when you\u2019re just at the gym you\u2019ll be impressed with its heart rate, activity and stress tracking.\n\nPlus, when you\u2019re not training like a beast, both Garmin swartwatches send smart notifications to alert you to phone calls, texts and calendar alerts, and automatically upload your data to the Garmin Connect online fitness community so you can compare stats with your fellow athletes.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Time to score up to $200 in savings.", "authors": ["Ashley Davis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FPytAjp8dQEAt0oeDKcjKw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_mens_health_171/c0a9e320cf1ad0ef3941c77757083974", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
