Matt Schaefer that a tweet he posted launched an attack from Hollywood actress and political activist Alyssa Milano. Senator Ted Cruz jumped into the fray and just like that, Milano is challenging Cruz to a debate.\n\nI\u2019m guessing that Milano has never heard of Texas State Rep. Schaefer but he came out strongly against the gun confiscation fever dreams uttered by Beto O\u2019Rourke, and other Democrats, over the Labor Day weekend. His thread on Twitter is not an unexpected response for a conservative politician in Texas. Milano saw it and it looks like Schaefer\u2019s reference to God-given rights is what set off the actress.\n\nCan someone cite which passage of the Bible God states it is a god-given right to own a gun? This guy is unbelievable and is clearly owned by the gun lobby. #NoRA https://t.co/PxVV1RoV2Z \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) September 1, 2019\n\nMilano\u2019s pearl-clutching response to Schaefer\u2019s call for prayer angered lots of folks on Twitter, to be fair. I saw many liberal residents of Texas, including our betters in the field of journalism, respond indignantly over Schaefer\u2019s tweets. The point he makes is that new federal laws would not stop gun deaths \u2013 it\u2019s not the magic cure-all that Milano thinks it is. I did a quick search of Schaefer\u2019s campaign donors and there is no NRA mention in the 2018 cycle.\n\nSenator Cruz answered Milano\u2019s request for someone to point out a Biblical reference to the right to own guns. He launched a tweetstorm of 10 tweets that explains to Milano that while modern day guns are not in the Bible, there are plenty of examples of biblical references to self-defense and protecting one\u2019s family.\n\nCruz responded, telling the anti-gun activist, it was an \u201cexcellent\u201d question, \u201cworth considering [without] the snark of Twitter,\u201d before citing a few examples from the Bible. \u201cIt is of course not the right to a modern-day firearm that is God-give [sic] but rather the right to Life & the right to Liberty. Essential to that right to life is the right to DEFEND your life & your family,\u201d the Texas conservative began.\n\nAn excellent Q, worth considering carefully w/o the snark of Twitter. It is of course not the right to a modern-day firearm that is God-give but rather the right to Life & the right to Liberty. Essential to that right to life is the right to DEFEND your life & your family. 1/x https://t.co/8pjstMGrGB \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 1, 2019\n\nAs we all know by now, Senator Cruz is an excellent debater. His series of tweets presented his case for the Second Amendment while addressing her concerns over biblical references. She used a biblical reference herself \u2013 to 1 Peter 4:8 (Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.) That\u2019s a nice verse but doesn\u2019t serve her well if a madman is pointing a loaded gun at her in an explosive situation. She has the constitutional right to defend herself.\n\nMilano mentioned to Cruz that she\u2019s coming to Washington, D.C. and would like to meet with him. She\u2019d like a debate \u2013 livestreamed, of course \u2013 so that Americans can hear his \u201cbullshit\u201d right from his mouth. She sounds like she\u2019s open-minded and ready for a thoughtful debate, right? Aren\u2019t liberals supposed to be the open-minded ones?\n\nI\u2019d love to come in and meet with you on the gun issue and many other issues that include life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, @tedcruz and also, 1 Peter 4:8. I\u2019ll be in DC next week. We can live-stream the meeting so the American people can hear your bullshit 1st hand. https://t.co/S3ljfjjOtG \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) September 2, 2019\n\nBless her heart. She continues to sound desperate for attention, using her political activism as a vehicle for it these days. I say, if he\u2019s so inclined, Ted Cruz should go ahead and debate her \u2013 he\u2019ll mop the floor with her.
