Prices are trading below the declining 50-day moving average line and below the almost flat 200-day line.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) peaked back in May and its long decline tells us that sellers of F have been more aggressive.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has spent most of its time below the zero line since June telling us that the trend strength is weak.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of F, below, we can see that prices have been working lower the past three years. F is below the slightly rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been zigzagging lower since April.\n\nThe MACD oscillator moved below the zero line for a sell signal in late August and early September.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of F, below, we can see a potential downside price target of $8.19. A trade at $7.94 will probably weaken the chart further should it happen.\n\nBottom line strategy: I will be turning in my leased Ford C-max electric hybrid in March and I am doubtful I will lease another Ford car with so many other EVs out there to choose from. The same goes for the stock of F - there are a lot more attractive stocks out there.
