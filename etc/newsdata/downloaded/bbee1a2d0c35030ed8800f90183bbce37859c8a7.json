People discussing the sensitive situation did so on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAt the United Nations Security Council, both the United States and Russia, for different reasons, refused to approve a European-proposed resolution condemning Turkey\u2019s action. Russia, whose air power has been decisive in helping Syrian President Bashar al-Assad all but vanquish opposition rebels, has formed a close relationship with Turkey.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAsked why the administration had balked at the word \u201ccondemn,\u201d which is being used by U.S. lawmakers of both parties and allies in Europe, the second administration official said a policy decision had been made to describe the Turkish operation as \u201ca bad idea.\u201d\n\nThe official repeated administration denials that Trump had given a \u201cgreen light\u201d to Erdogan to begin attacks against Syrian Kurdish forces that have served as the principal U.S. ally in combating the Islamic State. Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish group to be one and the same as the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, a Turkish group seeking autonomy that has clashed with Turkey\u2019s government for decades.\n\nTo fend off a cross-border attack against the Syrian Kurds, the administration had negotiated a deal with Turkey to establish a buffer zone between them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut after a Sunday call between Erdogan and Trump, the White House announced that Turkey was about to launch a military operation in northern Syria and that U.S. troops were getting out of the way.\n\nWhile the statement warned Turkey against excesses, Trump\u2019s failure to intervene, and the breadth of the subsequent attacks, have brought a torrent of bipartisan and international criticism and charges that the United States has abandoned its counterterrorism partners.\n\nAsked about reports of disagreements between the State and Defense departments about what to do, and military charges that Pompeo has been \u201ctoo passive\u201d in objecting to Trump\u2019s inaction, the second official shot back.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI have yet to have been in a crisis in all my years where there wasn\u2019t some military official who didn\u2019t find the [State] Department too passive and placid . . . because that\u2019s how they look at us. I have never seen Mike Pompeo . . . put more time into any one subject over a 72-hour period,\u201d the official said.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has said he would strike back if Turkey took action that he disapproved of. That, the official said, \u201cwould include ethnic cleansing\u201d of Kurdish areas in northern Syria and \u201cin particular, indiscriminate artillery, air and other fires directed at civilian populations. That is what we\u2019re looking at right now.\u201d The official said that \u201cwe have not seen significant examples\u201d of such abuses, \u201cbut we\u2019re very early.\u201d\n\nOn what the official said was Trump\u2019s preferred option of mediation, the national security team has been \u201ctasked by the president to try to see if there are areas of commonality between the two sides.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Turkish forces have been massing on the Syrian border, and Erdogan has been threatening to invade, for months with no indication the United States was trying to mediate. On Wednesday, Trump dismissed the Syrian Kurds as dispensable allies who \u201cdidn\u2019t help us in the Second World War\u201d and were only interested in fighting for \u201ctheir land.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFaced with the decision by Erdogan to go for broke,\u201d the official said, \u201cthe president took four decisions that have shaped everything we\u2019ve done.\u201d He said he would not \u201cendorse the invasion or provide support for it that Erdogan had requested.\n\n\u201cThirdly, the United States will not oppose the invasion militarily. Turkey is a NATO ally of ours,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe just think they\u2019re making a very big mistake.\u201d\n\nFinally, \u201cif Turkey acts in a way that is disproportionate or otherwise goes beyond the lines the president has in his own mind, the United States is willing to impose significant costs.\u201d\n\nJosh Dawsey and Carol Morello contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Administration appears increasingly divided on what to do amid criticism that the president abandoned the U.S.-allied Syrian Kurds.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RojwA1yiXBenTrcl4xc4ZPCxsoA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4QL42SHLW4I6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
