And you are creating a false narrative if you think that e-cigarettes are not going to lead to some pulmonary problems in some people.\u201d\n\nProponents of vaping argue that lawmakers should focus on the drug dealers who are tampering with cartridges instead of punishing the vape stores that aim to help people quit smoking.\n\n\u201cI'm not saying every store owner is doing something wrong. But the black market products are in the stores, too, not just on a corner,\" Sweeney said.\n\nThe American Vaping Association said it's disappointed in the President\u2019s decision to ban the sale of flavored vaping products.\n\n\u201cA ban will remove life-changing options from the market that have been used by several million American adults to quit smoking.\u201d Gregory Conley, president of the association, said in a statement. \u201cIn the history of the United States, prohibition has never worked. It didn\u2019t work with alcohol. It hasn\u2019t worked with marijuana. It won\u2019t work with e-cigarettes.\u201d\n\nE-CIGARETTES DAMAGE BLOOD VESSELS EVEN IF DEVICES DON\u2019T CONTAIN NICOTINE, STUDY FINDS\n\nAny e-cigarette legislation Sweeney proposes will need to pass the Senate and Assembly and then win approval from Gov. Phil Murphy.\n\n\u201cThe governor's formed a task force and within 21 days he's going to come back with recommendations. I've been drafting legislation with members of my house,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cSo we're putting the bill together we have you know what happens if you defy the law. What are the penalties? So the bill\u2019s being drafted and hopefully, within 30 days we're going to have a bill that I can put in my house and pass and hopefully pass in the other house.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf Sweeney\u2019s vaping bill goes through, it will make New Jersey the first state in the country to ban the sale of all vaping products.\n\n\u201cThere's nothing good about vaping. It's dangerous. And when people say \u2018well it's got me off the smoking,\u2019 it\u2019s not got you off the smoking, you're vaping. It's just a different way of smoking,\u201d Sweeney said.", "description": "In the midst of the e-cigarette epidemic.
