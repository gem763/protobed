(Picture: Backgrid)\n\nKim\u2019s husband had a chat with Big Boy over the weekend, in a bid to promote new album Jesus Is King.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the 42-year-old took a huge swipe at the Democratic party, claiming they \u2018brainwashed\u2019 black Americans, making them \u2018abort their children\u2019.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re [black Americans] brainwashed out here, bro. Come on, man. This is a free man talking,\u2019 he told the host. \u2018Democrats had us voting Democrats with food stamps for years. What are you talking about? Guns in the Eighties, taking the fathers out the home, Plan B, lowering our votes, making us abort our children\u2026\n\n\u2018Thou shall not kill.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t tell y\u2019all how to feel, but I can tell you honestly [this] is how I feel.\u2019\n\nWe personally never thought we\u2019d hear the words Kanye, abortion, and food stamps in the same sentence but here we are.\n\nAnd Yeezy has absolutely no fears about being \u2018cancelled\u2019 for his comments, as he only fears God.\n\nKanye doesn\u2019t care if he gets cancelled (Picture: SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Gold Digger rapper continued: \u2018I fear and love God. When you remove the fear and love of God, you create the fear and love of everything else. You\u2019re talking to someone right now who only fears God.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m only afraid of my daddy, God. I done been 15 years.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m telling you that God is showing you that you can have your own thoughts, bro. I been cancelled before there was cancel culture. Who told you that my career would be over?\u2019\n\nKanye also took aim at those who suggested he shouldn\u2019t be voting for President Donald Trump based on the colour of his skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The most racist thing a person can tell me is that I\u2019m supposed to choose something based on my race,\u2019 the dad-of-four added.\n\n\u2018If that was the case, I would\u2019ve never worn a pink polo, I would never have worn skinny jeans.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
