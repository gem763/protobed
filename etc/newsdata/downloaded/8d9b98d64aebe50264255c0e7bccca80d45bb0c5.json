'She loved her job and made a lot of sacrifices.'\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge has made one of her most loyal aides Sophie Agnew (right) redundant\n\nThe timing of the redundancy is said to have added to the disquiet. 'Sophie has only just got married and returned from her honeymoon,' the friend adds.\n\n'Everyone's been really shocked because it was so unexpected. It seems like extreme cost-cutting.'\n\nLike Kate, Sophie, 32, is a St Andrews history of art graduate. She was put in charge of the Duchess's personal assistants.\n\nSophie, who married insurance company director Stuart Hill, becomes the second prominent female aide to have left as soon as she tied the knot.\n\nThe Duchess's private secretary, Rebecca Deacon, quit in 2017. Often seen standing discreetly behind her royal boss during engagements, Miss Deacon played an important role during the Duke and Duchess' wedding.\n\nIn 2016, she was spotted lugging William's red-and-blue suit cover bearing his cipher, as well as a large Longchamp pliage bag\n\nSophie has been regularly seen by Kate's side and never objected to carrying out menial tasks.\n\nShe joined the couple on their 2014 trip to Australia and New Zealand and is often seen accompanying the Royals on their international trips.\n\nIn 2016, she was spotted lugging William's red-and-blue suit cover bearing his cipher, as well as a large Longchamp pliage bag, during their tour of Bhutan.\n\nPalace sources explain that Sophie is a victim of the big break-up between Princes William and Harry.\n\nThe brothers and their wives had been expected to form a 'Fab Four', but that all changed soon after Meghan married into the Royal Family.\n\nPalace sources explain that Sophie is a victim of the big break-up between Princes William and Harry\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit Kensington Palace for a new home at Windsor, and their households have split, as well as their charitable foundations.\n\n'It is true that Sophie has left after seven years of service,' a senior source confirms. 'Her role has been made redundant as a result of the split of the households.\n\n'She will not be replaced.'\n\nA Kensington Palace spokesman declines to comment. Sophie is similarly discreet.\n\nModel sisters Cara and Poppy Delevingne have been busy showing off their new LA home, which features a stripper pole.\n\nAnd now their property developer father Charles and mother Pandora have their own party pad.\n\nThis week, they moved into a \u00a310 million five-storey home in South Kensington after three years of what neighbours have called 'hellish' building works.\n\nIt includes a swimming pool, sauna, gym and underground cinema. A friend tells me: 'They're delighted to have finally moved in.'\n\nThe smart set's talking about... Net-a-Porter heiress Bella\n\nIsabella Massenet is hoping to make her mark on the fashion industry\n\nDame Natalie Massenet brought high-end fashion to the masses with the phenomenally successful retail website Net-a-Porter.\n\nNow, her daughter Isabella is hoping to make her own mark on the industry.\n\nI can reveal that the 19-year-old, who's known as Bella to pals, has been signed up by IMG Models, the agency that represents Kate Moss and the ubiquitous sisters Gigi and Bella Hadid.\n\nEducated at the French Lycee in South Kensington, Bella holidays in the Hamptons with the Delevingne sisters and is now in her second year at the University of California.\n\nThe willowy brunette \u2014 whose father is Natalie's first husband, the financier Arnaud Massenet \u2014 has just landed her debut campaign, modelling for SKIIM London.\n\nIt's a 'sustainable luxury' brand founded by her stepmother, Caroline Sciamma-Massenet, who married Arnaud after his divorce from Natalie.\n\nBella says: 'It was so fun getting to work with [her].'\n\nThe student enjoys being behind the camera, too: she's a promising photographer who shot a cover of Rollacoaster fashion magazine last year.\n\nJohn Humphrys is missing his son Owen, 19\n\nRetiring from Radio 4's Today programme after 32 years is not the biggest change in John Humphrys's life.\n\nThe BBC rottweiler has revealed that he's suffering from empty-nest syndrome after his son, Owen, 19, moved out.\n\n'My life has changed irrevocably because my youngest child has left home to go to university,' he sighs. 'You find yourself doing daft things like buying his favourite biscuits and then realising he won't be there to eat them.\n\n'And every time the phone rings or a text pings, you pretend you're not hoping it will be him.'
