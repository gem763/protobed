(Picture: BBC /Leigh Keily)\n\nThe drag performer also touched on entering the world of Drag Race for the first time in the show\u2019s seventh season.\n\nShe described entering the workroom for her introduction as \u2018the worst moment of my life.\u2019\n\n\u2018I was like, \u201cI made a mistake,\u201d\u2018 Katya remembers in a conversation with YouTube host Joseph Shepherd. \u2018I wasn\u2019t prepared to be judged on that level.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans of the show will remember that during its series seven, Katya eventually ended up placing in seventh place, before returning in style for All Stars 2 and finishing as runner-up.\n\nRuPaul herself, though, only seems to be going from strength to strength. The Supermodel of the World star is currently hosting the inaugural series of Drag Race UK.\n\nLast week\u2019s episode saw two impressions blow everyone away; The Vivienne\u2019s Donald Trump and Baga Chipz as Margaret Thatcher.\n\nWe get where Katya\u2019s coming from, though \u2013 if Geri Horner\u2019s lackluster appearence on the judging panel is anything to go by, you should never meet your heroes.\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK airs every Thursday at 8pm on BBC iPlayer.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
