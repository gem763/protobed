So why do I miss being pregnant so much?", "language": "en", "text": "The feeling was most intense in the bleary-eyed early days of mothering my newborn. There were times when I whined to my husband, \u201cI liked her more when she was in my womb.\u201d Even things like walking into my obstetrician\u2019s office, where I went often during those nine months, would make me feel weepy. Adjusting to motherhood was hard, and I missed her kicks.\n\nBeing pregnant also allowed me to feel beautiful in a way I never experienced before \u2014 and haven\u2019t felt since. My body positivity was at an all-time high. I may have been at my heaviest, but I proudly put my growing body on display. You wouldn\u2019t have caught me dead in a body-con dress before I was pregnant, but as long as I had that bump, no dress was too tight. Once the misery of the first trimester wore off, I was convinced I had the fabled pregnancy glow and reveled in it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf I\u2019m being really honest, I loved the attention. Our culture cherishes pregnant women. People scrambled to hold the door for me; flight attendants went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable and hydrated. Once my baby arrived, though, I felt invisible (and at times wanted to be). Despite what it has accomplished, I don\u2019t feel proud of my body \u2014 I just feel fat. Only six months into motherhood and I\u2019ve already lost track of the times people have watched me as I clumsily tried to open a door while pushing a stroller.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that being pregnant was all roses. Although I was fortunate to have an uncomplicated pregnancy, I was still riddled with anxiety for the first half of it. And at 35 weeks, I distinctly remember flipping the \u201cOver It\u201d switch. Climbing upstairs with a seven-pound bowling ball in your stomach isn\u2019t easy. But it\u2019s easy to look back at my pregnancy and miss all the comforts that came with it.\n\nI know I\u2019m not alone. I\u2019ve spoken to other new moms who pine for the excitement and anticipation of pregnancy, who recall unusually kind co-workers or cozy family moments. So I spoke with Elizabeth O\u2019Brien, an Atlanta therapist who specializes in postpartum issues, about why women long for their pregnancy after the baby arrives.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe piece we don\u2019t talk about [regarding child birth] is that combination of gaining and losing, loss and gaining. We gain a baby and we gain this relationship, but we have a loss of the pregnancy, sometimes a loss of containment and control,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s this really unique period of holding both the gaining of these experiences and the mourning of these other experiences all at the same time. It\u2019s intense.\u201d\n\nAs new mothers, we also battle feelings of inadequacy. When I was pregnant, I drank water like it was my job and went from having five cups of coffee daily to one, max. I was good at being pregnant. I didn\u2019t know what to do with the newborn in front of me crying inconsolably. \u201cIn this learning place, there\u2019s not a lot of confidence initially for anybody,\u201d O\u2019Brien says. \u201cAnd so it is being comfortable being in that place of vulnerability and really working through that.\u201d\n\nIn this hazy transition from Pregnant Goddess to New Mom, we aren\u2019t culturally set up for success. While new mothers in other countries are given additional support, here we\u2019re thrust back into the world without training wheels. \u201cYou could argue that mothers with little babies probably could benefit from more support than even what you got during your pregnancy, because it\u2019s you and this vulnerable new baby,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. \u201cAnd we in our culture unfortunately have lost that kind of reverence of the new mother and taking care of the new mother. And so I think that feeling of loss of pregnancy is mixed up in all of that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo work through these feelings, I take O\u2019Brien\u2019s advice to heart. \u201cBe willing to talk about it with safe, nonjudgmental people,\u201d she says. Because it\u2019s not something our culture acknowledges, I selectively share these feelings with friends who have also recently had babies. I often find that they\u2019re empathetic and can relate. The person in the store gushing over my babe probably doesn\u2019t want to hear me sighing over my pregnancy days, but even if a fellow new mom can\u2019t entirely relate, she gets that the postpartum period stirs up emotions that can be uncomfortable. Most importantly, O\u2019Brien says, \u201cit\u2019s something to acknowledge and to find support about, but know that you\u2019re not alone and to know that this is a phase you\u2019ll move through when you\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nWhile I still miss being pregnant, the intensity fades each month as my baby becomes more and more her own person. When I do feel that familiar longing, though, I remind myself that\u2019s okay and part of the process. Although it\u2019s not something we talk about as new mothers, many of us feel some degree of nostalgia for our pregnancies. \u201cHave compassion and normalize the experience to know that you are not alone,\u201d O\u2019Brien says. \u201cPregnancy and postpartum comes with gains and losses. That is normal.\u201d\n\nLia Picard lives in Atlanta, where she\u2019s learning the ropes of motherhood with her daughter and best baby friend, Abigail.
