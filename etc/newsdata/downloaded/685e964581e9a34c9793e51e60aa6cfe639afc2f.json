Following its update in the summer that rolled out the app\u2019s ability to mirror your phone\u2019s text messages and notifications, this will let you leave your phone in your pocket while you\u2019re on the PC. If you\u2019re not an Insider, you\u2019ll have to wait to try. But all you\u2019ll need is an Android phone (with 7 Nougat or later installed) with the Your Phone app downloaded from the Google Play Store.\n\nAccording to Microsoft\u2019s blog where it details all of its Insider preview builds, the calls feature will let you do the following:\n\nAnswer incoming phone calls on your PC.\n\nInitiate phone calls from your PC using the in-app dialer or contact list.\n\nDecline incoming phone calls on your PC with custom text or send directly to your phone\u2019s voicemail.\n\nAccess your recent call history on your PC. Clicking on a specific call will auto populate the number within the dialer screen.\n\nSeamlessly transfer calls between your PC and phone.\n\nIn order to use the feature, there are a few technical requirements to note. I already mentioned that the feature requires Android 7 Nougat (or higher), but you\u2019ll also need a Windows 10 PC that has Bluetooth support, the 10H1 build, and the Windows 10 build 18362.356.\n\nMicrosoft has slowly, but surely been building out its cross-functionality with Android phones, and it\u2019s getting even better with time. Of course, now that the news of its Surface Duo phone that runs on Android is public, it puts a totally different spin on developments like this. Microsoft is sprinting to add features that will give its Android phone a bunch of cool features out of the box. Better yet, it\u2019s offering them all to other compatible phones, too.\n\nMicrosoft says this feature will roll out first to Insiders on the 19H2 (or newer) build. As for when everyone else can try it, we\u2019ll keep you updated once we know.", "description": "Microsoft has announced that its Your Phone app supports phone calls on the latest Windows 10 Insider build.
