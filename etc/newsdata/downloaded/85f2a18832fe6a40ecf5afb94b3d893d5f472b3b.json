It\u2019s also a primary element for children to be able to learn and thrive in classrooms. How can a student concentrate on math lessons when his or her mind is on the upsetting words the bullies said at lunchtime? Or how can a student focus on the intricacies of Shakespeare\u2019s prose when he or she is distracted by the fight the gang is having in the hallway?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStressful school environments have repercussions that extend beyond a less-than-productive day of learning. Bullying affects children\u2019s mental and sometimes physical well-being. Even worse, the ensuing stress and anxiety can have long-lasting consequences that harm more than just their GPAs.\n\nBut there\u2019s good news: Children don\u2019t have to remain trapped in environments that cause them anguish. Data from the NCES survey show that \u201cIn 2017, a higher percentage of public school students ages 12\u201318 than of private school students in the same age group reported knowing of a gang presence at school (9 percent versus 2 percent), seeing hate-related graffiti at school (25 percent versus 6 percent) and being called hate-related words at school (7 percent versus 4 percent) during the school year.\u201d\n\nIn April, EdChoice published a study finding strong evidence suggesting that all else equal, private and charter schools had fewer discipline problems and expelled fewer students than traditional public schools.\n\nThose are astounding differences in how safe and wholesome public schools are compared to private schools. Shouldn\u2019t parents have the option to send their children to schools where they don\u2019t have to worry about bullies, gangs and hate speech?\n\nThe nation\u2019s teachers\u2019 unions don\u2019t seem to think so.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTeachers unions are constantly fighting against charter schools and education choice programs. They do so by spinning a web of half-truths and falsehoods the progressive media repeats, including the (false) claim that the intent of school choice is simply to \u201cdefund public schools\u201d and \u201cdestroy teachers unions.\u201d\n\nThey even have the audacity to proclaim that giving parents a say in where and how their children are educated somehow leads to reduced student achievement and a drop in \u201cstandards.\u201d\n\nNewsweek reported on NCES data from 2003 that showed similar math and reading scores from students at charter and other public schools.\n\nLisa Guisbond, executive director of Citizens for Public Schools, dismissed the data. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to me,\u201d Guisbond said. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of hype and mythologizing surrounding charter schools.\u201d\n\nYet, Newsweek points out, \u201cresearch done by Stanford University's Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) \u2026 found charter enrollment is \u2018especially helpful\u2019 for students in poverty, black students and English language learners. In 2015, a CREDO study found that charter schools also outperformed public schools in urban areas.\u201d\n\nIn other words, charter schools help kids where kids most need help. Even better, charters have improved over time, because low-performing charter schools are eventually closed \u2014 something that doesn\u2019t happen to poorly performing, traditional public schools. In fact, shoddy public schools tend to demand and receive more taxpayer dollars the worse they do.\n\nDon\u2019t believe the \u201chype\u201d and \u201cmythologizing\u201d the teachers unions spread about schools of choice. Private schools are safer. Even the federal government acknowledges this fact. And how can schools where children are afraid and in danger expect to provide a better education than their safer counterparts?\n\nTeachers\u2019 unions dodge this fundamental question because unbiased data show there is only one answer: \u201cSchool choice rules!\u201d This inconvenient truth isn\u2019t often repeated by many in government and elsewhere, because their primary concern is protecting bureaucrats and maintaining power, not addressing the needs of children suffering in unsafe classrooms.\n\nTeresa Mull is a policy advisor for The Heartland Institute and editor of gunpowdermagazine.com.", "description": "Bullying affects children\u2019s mental and sometimes physical well-being.
