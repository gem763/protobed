Bezos is the CEO of Amazon, which owns Whole Foods.\n\nDirect Action Everywhere is appearing to take credit for the demonstration. A live stream of the incident was broadcast on the group\u2019s Facebook page, showing activists seemingly chained to the store\u2019s front doors.\n\nAccording to the post, the protest was held to show support for Rose\u2019s Law, a proposed animal bill of rights supported by multiple animal rights groups.\n\nVEGAN FAMILY CLAIMS THEY HAVE 'LOST FRIENDS,' GET 'BULLIED' OVER LIFESTYLE\n\nThe post was captioned, \u201cActivists are chaining their necks to the doors of Whole Foods and locking down Amazon, asking Jeff Bezos to support the #RightToRescue animals from factory farms.\u201d\n\nSeveral posts on Twitter also claimed that protesters, possibly from the same group, had staged a scene at one of Amazon\u2019s offices in San Francisco.\n\nBased on the images, it appears that the demonstrators are hoping to get a response from Bezos.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nA source from Whole Foods confirmed the store closed, and all customers had exited. A tweet from someone claiming to be the sister of an employee had claimed \"a store full of customers and other employees\" had been held \"hostage\" at the location.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, a spokesperson for Whole Foods said the protest \"jeopardizes the safety\" of its customers.\n\n\"Direct Action Everywhere\u2019s repeated targeting of Whole Foods Market stores jeopardizes the safety of our customers and Team Members, including today at our Noe Valley store,\" the statement said. \"Whole Foods Market caters to customers with a wide variety of diets, and we\u2019re proud to provide transparency in animal welfare and growing practices through third-party certifiers like Global Animal Partnership. Our high-quality standards, including a commitment to animal welfare, have established us as an industry leader for nearly forty years.

According to them, only a few of the store\u2019s doorways had activists present at them and they weren\u2019t preventing anyone from leaving.\n\nThey also supplied a statement confirming that the protesters represent Direct Action Everywhere and that the demonstration is motivated by authorities not taking action to enforce animal cruelty laws, despite \u201cyears of accumulated evidence of criminal animal cruelty inside factory farms that supply to Amazon and Whole Foods (which was acquired by Amazon in 2017). Instead, it\u2019s the whistleblowers -- those who exposed the misconduct, and tried to help dying animals -- who are facing felony charges and potentially years behind bars.\u201c\n\nThe statement includes a quote from animal rights activist Priya Sawhney, who is reportedly facing eight felony charges for \u201ctrying to rescue dying animals from factory farms.\u201d It says, \u201cWe've tried everything to help animals being criminally abused at these factory farms that supply to Amazon. The authorities continually ignore the misconduct, then throw us in jail when we try to help dying animals ourselves. And through it all, Amazon stands by its supplier, refusing to even have a conversation with us.\u201d\n\nDirect Action Everywhere is asking Jeff Bezos to endorse Rose\u2019s Law and disavow the prosecution of \u201csix peaceful activists facing seven-plus felony charges each\u201d for allegedly trying to rescue animals from factory farms associated with Amazon.", "description": "Protestors reportedly chained themselves to the front of a Whole Foods in San Francisco.", "authors": ["Michael Hollan"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Whole-Foods.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
