Otherwise, that would have been very awkward wouldn\u2019t it?\u2019 she laughed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot as awkward as this situation!\n\nThe stars went onto sing Shawn Mendes\u2019 hit There\u2019s Nothing Holding Me Back, and while Eyal fell flat the other three didn\u2019t do half bad.\n\nThey\u2019ve got pipes (Picture: Rex)\n\nImpressed with what he saw, Louis said: \u2018There\u2019s good chemistry here isn\u2019t there, Simon?\u2019\n\nAnd it seems the father-of-one was in agreement, as he smiled: \u2018You know what? For a first audition, and bearing in mind where you came from, it was a good performance.\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s now about finding your distinct sound.\u2019\n\nCommenting on their voices, he gushed: \u2018But the fact you can all sing\u2026\u2019\n\nNicole Scherzinger added: \u2018It was so good,\u2019 before telling the group they have potential.\n\nX Factor: Celebrity kicks off tonight at 8.25pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
