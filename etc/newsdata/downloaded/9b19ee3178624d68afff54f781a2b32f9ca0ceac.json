The attackers extorted a fixed \u201cfee\u201d of 0.09 Bitcoin \u2014 roughly $740 at press time \u2014 from victims to recover access to their data via decryption keys.\n\nHaving himself paid \u20ac670 to the Muhstik perpetrators, Fr\u00f6mel hacked back their command and control server. He told Bleeping Computer that he had succeeded in retrieving the unique Hardware IDs (HWIDs) and decryption keys for the 2,858 Muhstik victims stored in the attackers\u2019 database.\n\nVictims have since confirmed in BleepingComputer's Muhstik support and help forum that the HWIDs are accurate and that the decryptor works.\n\nHaving succeeded in his task, Fr\u00f6mel conceded that his action was illegal, but argued that it was well-intentioned. He also provided a Bitcoin wallet address for fellow victims to tip him for his labor.\n\nSince Fr\u00f6mel\u2019s work, anti-virus firm Emsisoft has released decryption software for victims running ARM-based QNAP devices, which reportedly were not supported in Fr\u00f6mel\u2019s release.\n\nA growing threat\n\nLast month, Emsisoft also released a new free fix for the Bitcoin-demanding ransomware WannaCryFake.\n\nIn August, Cointelegraph reported that McAfee Labs\u2019 research indicating that ransomware attacks had increased by 118% in the first quarter of 2019.", "description": "German programmer Tobias Fr\u00f6mel \u201chacked back\u201d the perpetrators of the Muhstik ransomware who forced him to pay 0.09 BTC", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNzIxN2ViN2VlM2M5YTM3MWRiZWNiOGIzYTc4YTlkY2EuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
