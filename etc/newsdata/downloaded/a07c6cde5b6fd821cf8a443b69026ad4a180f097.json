They saved American lives.\"\n\nTamara Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Middle East Policy, said domestic political considerations may have played a role as well. She speculated that some prominent Republicans felt uncomfortable defending Trump over the Ukrainian scandal that prompted a House impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"I think it's not just Syria. I think this is about Republicans with a national spotlight feeling the need to show some daylight between them and the president,\" she said. \"Clearly they're feeling some need to show they're not in lockstep.\"\n\nWittes also pointed out a frightening potential knock-on effect if Turkey is allowed to attack the Kurds: a mass prison break by Islamic State detainees. Currently militia members are manning a series of prisons in Syria containing thousands of hardcore IS fighters. Those guards would presumably rush to the front lines if their comrades faced the existential threat of the Turkish military machine.\n\n\"The only foreign policy issue that Americans really care about is terrorism and the fear of terrorism,\" she said. \"The fear of ISIS 3.0 is very tangible and something that speaks to Americans.\"\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
