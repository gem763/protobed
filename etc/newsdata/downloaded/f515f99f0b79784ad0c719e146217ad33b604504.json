However, relations became strained by the European Commission's decision to phase out palm oil from transport fuel by 2030 and the imposition of anti-subsidy duties on Indonesia's biodiesel exports.\n\nSiregar said that Widodo, commonly known as Jokowi, also wanted him to ensure Southeast Asia's biggest economy retained its privileged trade status with the US, known as the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which gives Indonesia reduced tariffs on about $2bn of exports.\n\nLast year, the US Trade Representative's Office said it was reviewing the GSP eligibility of Indonesia, India and Kazakhstan, based on concerns over compliance with services and investment criteria. The GSP facility for India was revoked in June.\n\nGetting the GSP eligibility extended \"could have a massive impact which could double the size of our trade with the US\", said Siregar, who earlier this year moved to Washington, DC as Indonesia's ambassador to the US.\n\nWashington has a number of demands for Indonesia to maintain its GSP status, which has mostly been fulfilled, including relaxing its data storage rules.\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is scheduled to visit Jakarta next month.\n\nJakarta's main foreign trade strategy would now be overseen by the foreign ministry under the president's direct guidance, Siregar said, instead of the trade ministry.\n\nIndonesia's palm oil industry is also one of Widodo's trade priorities and he wants to increase exports to more than $25bn a year, Siregar said. Exports of palm oil and derivatives in 2018 were $16.5bn, according to government data.", "description": "Southeast Asia's largest palm oil producer seeks to retain its privileged trade status with the US and sign an EU deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/23/4abb08a959a84a87abc50ef6671e6b47_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
