On Twitter, \u201cBarron\u201d is trending as I write this. I\u2019d like to go to bat for the teenager and join in with those asking that Barron Trump be left alone.\n\nChildren of elected officials \u2013 especially the underage ones of the President of the United States \u2013 are off-limits. Period. The kids didn\u2019t sign up for a life in the spotlight and the least that adults can do is allow them to cope with the stress public life presents in private. The Obama girls were allowed privacy as they grew up in the White House. Barron Trump deserves the same courtesy. He\u2019s thirteen years old. Life is difficult enough at that age, much less growing up with all of America watching.\n\nTrump made an appearance at Nationals Park for Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday, where he was promptly jeered as live footage of him showed up on stadium screens. His wife, First Lady Melania Trump, and several Republican members of Congress were in attendance in his suite at the Houston Astros-Washington Nationals matchup, but the president\u2019s youngest son was nowhere to be seen.\n\nScolds on Twitter decided to tear into the president for not bringing along Barron. It was just one more chance for the anti-Trumpers to go after him. Trump\u2019s entourage consisted of Congress members plus First Lady Melania Trump.\n\nDude didn\u2019t bring his own kid to the game. I guess Barron is watching at home? https://t.co/w6umvgoti5 \u2014 Jill Filipovic (@JillFilipovic) October 28, 2019\n\n\u201cDude\u201d didn\u2019t bring any of his other children, either. Maybe Barron isn\u2019t a baseball fan. Maybe he doesn\u2019t like large crowds and noisy events. Or, I would argue, maybe Barron\u2019s parents anticipated how the president would be welcomed \u2013 with boos and jeers \u2013 and they decided a thirteen-year-old didn\u2019t need to hear that ugliness directed toward his father in person.\n\nPresident Trump and Melania didn\u2019t bring any of the Trump kids \u2013 most are grown adults with their own families \u2013 nor did they bring any of the grandchildren. Some on Twitter mocked the decision to exclude the younger Trumps and Rep. Matt Gaetz was mocked as Trump\u2019s \u201clittle Matt\u201d by many. Here is how one of our Hollywood betters mocked Gaetz. If the name isn\u2019t familiar, don\u2019t worry. No one else remembers the aging actor, either. He was in some television shows, back in the day.\n\nI guess Barron doesn\u2019t like baseball, but little Matt Gaetz does. \u2014 Ken Olin (@kenolin1) October 28, 2019\n\nCan you imagine anything more torturous than attending THE quintessential American sporting event with Melania Trump, Lindsey Graham, and Matt Gaetz!? AND then getting booed by the 45,000 other people there!\n\nDamn, I love the Nationals and their fans. \u2014 Ken Olin (@kenolin1) October 28, 2019\n\nAnother Hollywood actor had a more mature opinion, which is refreshing in the Age of Trump.\n\nI\u2019m sincerely grateful Trump didn\u2019t bring Barron. No kid deserves to hear his dad booed this way. https://t.co/n2mLJvb9R6 \u2014 Jon Cryer (@MrJonCryer) October 28, 2019\n\nSome spoke up for Barron and reminded the haters to keep him out of social media.\n\nFor a while we haven\u2019t seen Barron Trump mentioned (which is a good thing) but I\u2019ve seen an uptick recently\u2026including this tweet. He\u2019s 13-years-old and didn\u2019t choose this life. You have no idea why he wasn\u2019t there, Rob. Leave him alone. https://t.co/hqJhC4H0v7 \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 28, 2019\n\nDon, Jr. spoke up for his young half-brother. He pointed to the fact that Trump only got 4% of the vote in Washington, D.C. so clearly the crowd wasn\u2019t going to be a friendly one.\n\nThis is the dumbest take ever! I mean f-ing stupid!!! Maybe he knew that the scumbag lobbyists and liberal elite in the 94% leftist swamp of DC would behave exactly as they did and therefore shielded a child from that kind of behavior. That\u2019s great parenting moron! https://t.co/oeLqaR02Is \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 28, 2019\n\nThe blue checks and media on Twitter were gleeful when Trump was booed and when the crowd chanted, \u201cLock him up!\u201d This was the same day that Trump announced that a major ISIS player was killed by our military. To the Trump deranged that dwell in the swamp, trashing the president at a major sporting event televised across the country was a perfectly normal thing to do. There is no expectation of respect for the office, if not for the man, with that crowd. This is why Americans outside of D.C. feel no connection to them. Basic human decency goes out the window if political points can be scored, even at a baseball game. The people sitting in those seats paid a lot of money to be there. They are the most entitled of the entitled class. It showed.\n\nWashington DC booing Trump at a baseball game the same day the US took out the top terror target in the world says more about Washington DC than it does about Trump. \u2014 Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) October 28, 2019\n\nAs a very happy Astros fan, I\u2019ll end with this tweet from my friend, Sandi:\n\nSwept at home doo doo doo \u2014 Sandi (@SandiInHtownTX) October 28, 2019\n\nGo, Astros!", "description": "\"Dude didn\u2019t bring his own kid to the game.\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a877ba28-7043-4465-8d3c-aa88ec21d569.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
