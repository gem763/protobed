Or at least you can try. It\u2019s one of the greatest parking hacks in the world: If you shovel out a snowed-in parking spot in Chicago, and you put a placeholder in the space, a lot of people will honour your \u201cdibs\u201d and not take the parking spot from you. You own that spot until the snow melts. Especially if you threaten anyone who steals it. But wherever you live, we\u2019d love your hacks for local city parking.\n\nWhat\u2019s your local parking hack? Is there an especially good parking lot that will validate with a small purchase? A way to get free parking near the stadium? A rule of thumb for finding open spots on the street? A recommendation of one garage over another? A good Facebook group for renting your spot to someone else?\n\nDoes your city have exclusive parking spots for certain kinds of vehicles? Are there unorthodox \u2014 or sketchy \u2014 ways to get a parking permit? Any way to stretch your parking pass beyond its usual window?\n\nWhat are the local pitfalls \u2014 street cleaning rules, local laws that aren\u2019t reflected on signs, dirty tricks that cops pull so they can issue more tickets?

What do you look for, how do you identify a car about to leave, how do you keep someone else from swooping in?\n\nDon\u2019t tell the world where your one precious parking spot is. But in the spirit of camaraderie with your fellow drivers, share your best practices and hacks, and they\u2019ll share theirs. Super-local specifics and general advice are both welcome.", "description": "During a Chicago winter, you can reserve a parking spot with a folding chair, a playpen, or a giant teddy bear.
