Consequently, PiS has also pledged investment in solar power, offshore wind and nuclear power, to cut emissions.\n\nIf, as expected, the ruling Law and Justice Party remain in power after Sunday they will face a crucial legislative hurdle\n\n\u201cThe government says new legislation is needed so they can mine coal when the country needs it. Politicians will vote on the proposed law just two days after the election. Critics argue the private members' bill has been rushed through without proper scrutiny,\u201d Euronews' Oliver Whitfield-Miocic reported.\n\nThe bill has infuriated the fledgeling Green Party.\n\nClimate change protests are becoming more frequent in Poland as public concern grows, but despite several attempts, the party has never had a politician elected to Parliament.\n\nNow they're hoping Sunday's election will see them break into mainstream politics.", "description": "Climate change protests are becoming more frequent in Poland as public concern grows, but despite several attempts, the party has never had a politician elected to Parliament.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/52/66/1000x563_cmsv2_0940ad29-5b7f-56b4-8cfe-9a78e9144c92-4225266.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
