But what about outstanding public servants who quietly serve our country?\u201d said Max Stier, the Partnership\u2019s president and CEO. \u201cAmericans should know as much about these heroes as they do about their favorite actors and athletes. . . . At a time when government dysfunction dominates the headlines, it is even more important to share stories of exceptional civil servants who are making a difference and remind the public how our federal workforce serves them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the first time in the history of the awards, all winners are from outside the Washington area, which is indicative of the 85 percent of federal employees who do not live in the capital region, which includes counties as far away as West Virginia. Here are the accomplishments of the six winners cited by the Partnership:\n\nFederal Employee of the Year to Victoria Brahm, 61, director of the Tomah Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center in Tomah, Wis. She is honored for restoring \u201cthe quality and safety of a broken health care center for veterans that had become notorious for unsafe medical practices, excessive opioid use and a toxic work environment.\u201d Brahm, a 38-year federal employee, told the Federal Insider she considers her work \u201ca calling for an honorable mission to care for those who took care of us.\u201d\n\nPaul A. Volcker Career Achievement Medal to Ann McKee, 66, chief of neuropathology at the VA Boston Healthcare System in Boston. She \u201crevolutionized scientific research and our understanding of the long-term effects of concussions, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy, in veterans and athletes.\u201d McKee said the VA\u2019s \u201cbureaucracy can be daunting,\u201d but she remains \u201cfascinated by the brain. . . . My work tries to advance our understanding of the human brain in health and in disease.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nManagement Excellence Medal to Robert Cabana and team. Cabana, director of NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, was selected for transforming the \u201cCenter into a globally distinguished, multiuser launch site for government and commercial space exploration, helping preserve our country\u2019s leadership in this important field.\u201d At \u201c70 years young,\u201d Cabana said \u201cI have been serving our nation since I graduated from high school\u201d and calls his work \u201cpretty darn significant and very rewarding.\u201d\n\nNational Security and International Affairs Medal to Ryan Shelby, 35, diplomatic attache and Foreign Service engineering officer for the U.S. Agency for International Development in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Shelby \u201cprovided vital training and resources to help people in Haiti rebuild thousands of homes and roofs ripped apart by a Category 4 hurricane, making the structures safer and stronger to withstand future disasters.\u201d Shelby said, \u201cUSAID/Haiti worked with community members to rebuild and improve the hurricane resistance of 5,000 roofs using a market-based approach, trained 6,425 people in reconstruction techniques, reconstructed seven water distribution points, and improved the sanitary blocks of 12 schools, which benefited 712 children.\u201d\n\n\n\nSafety and Law Enforcement Medal to Jamie Rhome, 43, storm surge specialist with the National Hurricane Center in Miami. He \u201ccreated a new forecasting model and warning system that more accurately predicts the deadly storm surge caused by hurricanes, saving lives by alerting residents sooner of the approaching danger.\u201d When Rhome talks to private-sector colleagues who balk at joining the federal government because they would take a pay cut, he tells them about \u201cthe mission and the sense of pride\u201d among federal workers and how that \u201cmore than compensates for any salary loss.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScience and Environment Medal to Daniel B. Jernigan, 55, influenza division director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Jernigan \u201cled response efforts for dozens of disease crises, including Ebola, SARS and West Nile virus, while greatly improving our country\u2019s ability to identify, prepare for and respond to inevitable flu pandemics.\u201d He said he loves working where he \u201ccan have a rapid and very tangible impact on an emerging public health threat.\u201d\n\nThe infectious enthusiasm of the winners for their work was clear when each told me they would recommend the federal government as a place to work. Most prefaced their comments on that point with \u201cabsolutely.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t have the government we want if we don\u2019t celebrate the things we like. . . . They are incredible people,\u201d Stier said of the winners, \u201cand no one knows about them and they should.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "For the first time, all winners of the \u201cSammies\u201d are from outside the Washington area, indicative of the 85 percent of federal employees who do not live in the capital region.", "authors": ["Joe Davidson", "Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/T-VQhDI6GfEIRv_0HwHn3yMsgPw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L3XOXKWLMAI6TPQF65VMJ3DBRQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
