In moving forward, we\u2019re focusing on replacement. Let\u2019s move away from using animals altogether,\u201d Ms. Conlee said.\n\nNew drugs must undergo a nonclinical developmental phase, which often involves animal testing, in order to win FDA approval.\n\nElizabeth Baker, pharmaceutical policy program director for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, said many of the animal tests used today were developed in the 1960s, before modern scientific advances emerged. She said many tests are driven largely by antiquated policies.\n\nThe federal Animal Welfare Act of 1966 regulates the housing and transportation of research animals but not experiments conducted on them, according to the education nonprofit ProCon.org. The law does require that each research facility create a three-member committee focused on the care and use of its animals.\n\nSeveral agencies have announced plans to reduce animal testing. The Environmental Protection Agency said last month that it will phase out animal testing by 2035. Earlier this year, the Department of Agriculture said it would stop using cats and kittens in research experiments.\n\nBut animal rights advocates say big changes in drug development and animal testing will not happen unless FDA guidelines change.\n\nLast November, then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency supports decreasing animal testing.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is committed to animal welfare in research by reducing, replacing and/or refining the use of animals in research whenever possible,\u201d said Dr. Gottlieb, pointing to a study that could offer a way for drug developers to conduct certain types of research without using dogs.\n\nThe study involves a small number of dogs who would be subject to \u201cminimally invasive blood sampling\u201d and adopted as pets at the completion of a short trial. This would eliminate the need to use dogs in specific types of studies, some in which the dogs otherwise might be euthanized.\n\nHowever, the FDA said animal testing is still necessary in many areas.\n\n\u201cNon-animal testing is not yet a scientifically valid and available option,\u201d the agency says on its website.\n\nMs. Conlee of the Humane Society said the FDA is the authority on animal testing. She said Congress could pressure the agency and drug companies could refuse to follow its animal testing protocols.\n\nA drug company that is resisting the FDA guidelines on animal research is Vanda Pharmaceuticals. The company declined to conduct a non-rodent toxicity study, which typically uses beagle puppies, to test a drug that already had cleared in humans, said A.J. Jones II, Vanda\u2019s chief corporate affairs and communications officer.\n\n\u201cThe animal studies the FDA demands, including the nine-month, non-rodent toxicity study, have been considered routine in the pharmaceutical industry for decades, despite the growing body of evidence discrediting such studies\u2019 scientific value,\u201d Vanda said in an open letter to the FDA. \u201cFor this reason, drug companies typically conduct the studies reflexively, without challenging the FDA.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FDA has relied on industry complacency for too long,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nVanda filed a complaint against the FDA in February to ask a court to lift a partial clinical hold that the agency imposed to prohibit the company from studying the new drug in humans for more than 12 weeks without conducting animal studies.\n\nThe FDA says animals sometimes are used to test drugs, vaccines and other biologics and medical devices mainly to determine the products\u2019 safety. For drugs and biologics, animal testing is used to study the drug\u2019s nature, chemistry, effects and potential harm to the body.\n\nFor medical devices, the focus of animal testing is on the device\u2019s ability to work with living tissue without harming the tissue. But most devices use materials such as ceramic or stainless steel that are not compatible with human tissues and don\u2019t require animal testing.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
