(Picture: Joey Kidd/Caters News)\n\n\u2018We actually started Eris\u2019 Instagram as a scrap-booking project with the intentions of having a place for us to look back on her growth and have a favourite picture from each day.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been wild to watch it grow in the way that it has.\n\n\u2018Whilst there are other dogs that are a bit longer than her in general, I definitely think she could be in the running for the world\u2019s longest nose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think there is anybody tracking this record at the moment though\u2026 but it would be great for Eris if they did!\n\n\u2018Sighthound dogs have always been a fascination for me, and Borzois are incredibly gracious as a breed.\n\n\u2018Walk with Eris can take a very long time in the day; We get stopped a lot as people want to ask questions or know what kind of dog she is.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s got a really big personality, and a lot of our neighbours know who she is, and she loves saying hello!\u2019\n\nJoey wanted a Borzoi Sighthound due to their calm and friendly nature, but also for their lack of health issues too which are common with larger dogs.\n\nLook how long it is! (Picture: Joey Kidd/Caters News)\n\nHe added: \u2018They\u2019re a very quiet breed \u2013 for example we can count the number of times Eris has barked on one hand \u2013 and they\u2019re incredibly sweet.\n\n\u2018Borzoi\u2019s also have the size of some of the larger breeds without having many health issues.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re so light on their frame that joint problems are fairly rare, as are heart issues from what I can tell; they really do seem like a perfect breed.\u2019\n\nMORE: Shoppers think this Halloween latex scar looks like a \u2018bloody vagina\u2019\n\nMORE: Poundland is selling Harry Potter-inspired invisibility cloaks for free\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A dog has become Instagram famous due to her long nose, which measures at 31 centimetres.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89840815_1571060919.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
