Swedes receive a bright orange envelope in the mail with account statements, and the psychological effects have reportedly enticed some to work longer, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe Swedish system also requires, or encourages, workers to take time to research the funds and choose the appropriate one for their portfolios, according to Brookings. Not everyone will choose wisely.\n\nSweden is now in the midst of another wave of pension reform. Currently, retirees can withdraw from their pensions any time between ages 61 and 67, but under the new rules, they\u2019ll have to be a specific age \u2014 in 2023, they\u2019ll need to be 62, for example. By 2026, the age will be 64, and thereafter the age will be tied to life expectancy rates, said Annika Strandhall, Sweden\u2019s Minister for Social Security. The country is also extending the right to stay in the labor market, as opposed to being forced out at 67 if the company wants (as is the case now).\n\nAnd there\u2019s still more work to be done, especially in regards to ensuring women and new parents are properly covered. \u201cThese groups feel they are not getting out from the system what they should get,\u201d Strandhall said. \u201cThey also feel like they have lost when they changed the pension system in the \u201890s.\u201d\n\nPrivatizing a portion of the pension system was just a small piece of the previous reform, but it is something the U.S. couldn\u2019t do. President George W. Bush proposed privatizing Social Security in the early 2000s, arguing the system had funding issues and needed to be changed. Critics said private accounts could hinder Americans\u2019 future retirement security, since so much of their money would be at risk if the markets were to see a downturn.\n\nWhile investments are naturally risky, having a privatized account solely for individuals could safeguard them from any political risk. Defined contribution and, in rare cases, defined-benefit plans, are also available.\n\nSo far, the country has proved its system works \u2014 the Swedish pension has survived during periods of market volatility, including the Great Recession, Boulhol said. \u201cThe system proved to be resilient,\u201d he said.", "description": "Some groups feel they have been left behind by the last wave of reforms", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ776_Sweden_ZG_20190905152209.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
