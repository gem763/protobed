Mandatory Credit: Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts will return to the team in 2020, despite the team\u2019s heartbreaking loss in the National League Division Series, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nTheTimes cited a pair of sources who confirmed Roberts\u2019 status.\n\nIn four seasons at the helm of the Dodgers, Roberts has a 393-256 (.606) record with four National League West titles and two NL pennants. Still, his teams haven\u2019t lived up to expectations in the postseason, finishing 25-22 (.532).\n\nThe Dodgers lost to the 2017 World Series to the Houston Astros in seven games and the 2018 series to the Boston Red Sox in five games.\n\nRoberts was roundly criticized following Wednesday night\u2019s loss to the Washington Nationals in the deciding fifth game of the NLDS. The Dodgers were up 3-1 entering the eighth inning, but Clayton Kershaw, pitching in relief, surrendered back-to-back solo home runs to tie the game.\n\nIn the 10th inning, Roberts didn\u2019t remove reliever Joe Kelly, who had loaded the bases and went on to give up the game winning grand slam home run to Howie Kendrick.\n\n\u201cIf the blame falls on me, I\u2019ve got no problem with it,\u201d Roberts, 47, said after the Game 5 loss. \u201cI feel that my job is to put guys in the best position to have success and if it doesn\u2019t work out, there\u2019s always going to be second-guessing, and I got no problem wearing the brunt of that. That\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nRoberts is signed through the 2022 season.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Dodgers manager Dave Roberts will return to the team in 2020, despite the team's heartbreaking loss in the National League Division Series, the Los Angeles Times reported.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439772041&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1Q2-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
