The @GMB logo and time were in an unfortunate position this morning,\u2019 they wrote.\n\nWhoops (Picture: Twitter)\n\n\u2018Brilliant, that made me smile,\u2019 replied another.\n\nEarlier this month, Good Morning Britain\u2019s Laura Tobin had to think on her feet after a live technical blunder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer weather map refused to play ball, forcing her to \u2018improvise\u2019 for viewers watching at home.\n\nWhile delivering the unwelcome but unsurprising news that the country should brace itself for more rain,she explained: \u2018Weather wise we are talking about Hurricane Lorenzo, but today the forecast is for yet more rain.\u2019\n\nMore recently, Andi Peters tripped up and fell flat on his face as he introduced a competition live from Outer Mongolia.\n\nAfter he picked himself up from the floor, Andi told viewers at home and hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid that he could hear his boss cracking up in hysterics.\n\n\u2018My producer over there is literally laughing so much,\u2019 he admitted.\n\n\u2018This trip, trip literally, is turning into my worst nightmare coming to Outer Mongolia with no notice, but anyway, you could be having lots of notice getting that call from us saying you\u2019ve won \u00a3500,000,\u2019 Andi added later.\n\nOh the joys of live television.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
