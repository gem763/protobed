Look at the people, same level, same eyes.\n\n\"This was Aiia. She liked all the people, all the humans. Doesn't matter where and when.\n\n\"This is how I want to remember Aiia.\"\n\nMs Maasarew had previously studied Chinese and English at Shanghai University before moving to Australia to continue her education.\n\nShe had been at a comedy club in Melbourne on the night she was attacked.\n\nFriends dropped her off at a Bourke Street tram stop in the central business district at about 10.50pm.\n\nThe international student got off a tram outside a shopping centre and called her sister, who was overseas, to catch up, but as they were talking she was attacked.\n\nShe is believed to have dropped the phone as the \"horrendous\" crime was committed, and her sister then \"heard voices\" and alerted police.\n\n(Image: Aiia Maasarwe/Instagram)\n\nHerrmann repeatedly beat her over the head with a metal pole, sexually assaulted her and then covered her if WD-40 spray before setting her alight.\n\nIn June, Herrmann admitted the rape and murder of Aiia and he wrote a bizarre apology letter to her parents which was read out to the court during a pre-sentencing hearing.\n\nIt said: \"I'm sorry. Your daughter didn't deserve such a terrible and tragic thing to happen to her.\n\n\"I will try to make amends for the rest of my life.\"\n\n(Image: Aiia Maasarwe/Instagram)\n\nHe also added: \"Don't give in to hate like I did.\"\n\nHermrmann's lawyers had argued that he deserved some leniency because a severely traumatic childhood had resulted in him having a personality disorder which gave him a \"warped\" view of the world.\n\nSentencing him Judge Hollingworth said: \"Women should be free to walk the streets alone without fear of being violently attacked by a stranger.\"", "description": "Codey Herrmann beat Aiia Maasarwe over the head with a metal pole at least 13 times before he raped and killed her in north Melbourne, Australia, on January 16", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Aiia Maasarwe Instagram", "Aap Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20748653.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_CODEY-HERRMANN-COURT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
