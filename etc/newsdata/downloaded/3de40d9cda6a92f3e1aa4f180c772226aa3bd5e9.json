All 18 players are fit, well and ready to go. We are ready for the final push with a big two games.\n\n'We are in a healthy position up-front in order to withstand the two massive Tests ahead of us.\n\n'And they will be big tests. We will have to be at our best and take it one day at a time. Get the Fiji game out of the way first, and then we can fully focus on Uruguay.'\n\nWales' win over Australia has given them control of Pool D and a win over Fiji will seal progress\n\nWales assistant coach Robin McBryde believes the squad are 'recharged' for the Fiji game\n\nWales's competition for places is underlined by their back-row riches.\n\nFlanker James Davies and No 8 Ross Moriarty are both handed first starts of the tournament, Josh Navidi switches to blindside, with Aaron Wainwright on the bench and Justin Tipuric not involved.\n\n'It's an exciting mix,' McBryde added. 'It's a very competitive part of the squad - they are keen to make the most of their opportunities.\n\nAnd Moriarty said: 'I've got the start on Wednesday, and I am really excited for it. I've been working hard in training, and it has been great competition in the back-row and we are all fit and firing.\n\n'We know it's going to be tough. It won't be easy, but we have been working hard in the last week and we've done our analysis.\n\n'We will have to close Fiji down in defence, and in attack we want to get points on the board.\n\n'We know they have some great individuals, but so do we, and we are just going to make sure we put everything out there and do the job.\n\nAaron Shingler on the ball as Wales prepare for their penultimate World Cup pool match\n\nDan Biggar is pictured on the training field ahead of their meeting with Fiji in Oita\n\n'I was fortunate to play for Gloucester's A team against Fiji A when I was 18, which was a bit of an eye-opener.\n\n'To be on this stage now makes it even bigger, and I am excited to get out on the pitch, get a start and show everyone what I can do.'\n\nWales have beaten Fiji nine times in 11 previous meetings, and it will be a major surprise if they do not maintain that record under a closed roof at the 40,000-capacity Oita Stadium.\n\n'They are big men, and we are aware of that threat,' McBryde said. 'We've got to make sure, collectively, we work well, get really tight and match them.\n\n'We are really looking forward to the contest. Historically, we always get stronger the more time we spend with each other.'", "description": "Robin McBryde says Wales are recharged and ready to go as they target a place in the World Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday.
