It\u2019s activated when you make the sign of the cross, and tracks your steps, calories, and location.\n\nWhen you wish to pray, you can use the Click to Pray app to pick a particular rosary. According to the Vatican\u2019s press release, \u201cOnce the prayer begins, the smart rosary shows the user\u2019s progress throughout the different mysteries and keeps track of each rosary completed.\u201d The app, where the Pope apparently maintains a profile, \u201cconnects thousands of people around the globe to pray every day. The Click To Pray eRosary is also intended to accompany him in his daily and monthly intentions in order to build a world with the taste of the Gospel.\u201d\n\nThat sounds harmless enough, but at least one security researcher discovered a security flaw in the app over the weekend. Fidus Information Security, a UK firm, apparently discovered the vulnerability within minutes of the app launching. Security researcher Elliot Alderson demonstrated it to CNET. In lieu of a password, the app sends a PIN to your registered email address, which you use to log in.\n\nLess than 5 minutes into looking at the eRosary application our research team has developed a full account takeover exploit. Can obtain e-mails, phone numbers, height, weight and other personal data. This has been reported. Luckily it's so new it's not in the wild yet. pic.twitter.com/XpqYqDpgC2 \u2014 Fidus InfoSecurity (@FidusInfoSec) October 17, 2019\n\nTrouble is, the PIN code can also be seen by anyone who could see the app traffic, as it would be contained in the API\u2019s response. So you could, in theory, see the PIN without needing access to the email account. Requesting a PIN also apparently logs you out of your session in the app, meaning a person could be kicked out and not be able to log back in because someone\u2019s already using a requested PIN. The person who accessed your account would be able to see any information there, including your prayers, your steps, etc.\n\nAccording to CNET, the issue has now been fixed. Alderson apparently had to pester the Vatican about the issue, but eventually someone listened. The Register reports both Alderson and Fidus reported the vulnerability at roughly the same time \u2014 which is, again, within a day of the app becoming widely available.\n\nElliot found a vulnerability in a newly-released app loosely connected to my office. He was persistent in finding somebody in the Vatican with whom he could discuss his findings. He was patient with our dev team. He provided everything we needed to fix the vulnerability. https://t.co/CVn07tOEDF \u2014 Fr. Robert R.

Still, it\u2019s not that unusual for a wearable, and it\u2019s good to know the situation\u2019s been attended to. I\u2019m not optimistic enough to think that\u2019s the last we\u2019ll hear of something like this happening, though.\n\nRead next: JBL 100 Classic Review: An iconic '70s speaker revived as a modern standout", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FClick-to-Pray-eRosary.jpg&signature=0a3e70306ddeff11304c64b11f9810b3", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
