Guyger received a 10-year prison sentence for fatally shooting Botham Jean, an unarmed man in a Dallas apartment she had mistaken for her own.\n\nKemp left the bench to approach and hug the tearful Guyger, handing her what she said was one of the personal Bibles she used every day.\n\n\"This is your job for the next month,\" Kemp told Guyger. \"It says right here. John 3:16. And this is where you start. 'For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life ...'\"\n\nThe Freedom from Religion Foundation, which includes presidential son Ron Reagan Jr., on its honorary board, filed its complaint Thursday with the Texas State commission on Judicial Conduct, saying Kemp's \"proselytizing actions overstepped judicial authority.\"\n\nThe Wisconsin-based group asked the commission to investigate the incident as a violation under the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct.\n\nHow many years will Guyger serve? That could depend on Botham Jean's family\n\nCourtroom forgiveness: Jean's brother hugged Guyger, and the world took note\n\nState District Judge Tammy Kemp gives former Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger a hug before Guyger leaves for jail, Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019, in Dallas. Guyger, who said she mistook neighbor Botham Jean's apartment for her own and fatally shot him in his living room, was sentenced to a decade in prison. More\n\nDuring the four-minute encounter between the judge and Guyger, according to the complaint, Kemp told the 31-year-old former Dallas cop, \u201cIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m good. It\u2019s because I believe in Christ. I\u2019m not so good. You haven\u2019t done as much as you think you have, and you can be forgiven. You did something bad in one moment in time. What you do now matters.\u201d\n\nThe gesture came not long after Brandt Jean, the brother of the 26-year-old man Guyger killed, had been given permission by the judge to hug the defendant.\n\n\"It is perfectly acceptable for private citizens to express their religious beliefs in court, but the rules are different for those acting in a governmental role,\" the complaint said. \"We, too, believe our criminal justice system needs more compassion from judges and prosecutors. But here, compassion crossed the line into coercion.\"\n\nRead this: Kentucky governor asks students to participate in 'Bring Your Bible to School Day'\n\nThe judge quickly found defenders, including the Texas-based First Liberty Institute, which supports religious freedom.\n\n\u201cWe should all be thankful the law allows Judge Kemp\u2019s actions,\u201d said Hiram Sasser, legal counsel for the First Liberty Institute. \u201cWe stand with her and will gladly lead the charge in defending her noble and legal actions.\u201d\n\nAsked if Kemp\u2019s gesture was a violation of court procedure, policy or protocol, Dallas County District Attorney John Cruezot tells CBS11 that if anyone complained, \"I would do everything I could to support the appropriateness of it.\"\n\n\"I can\u2019t tell you I\u2019ve done the same exact thing, but I have spoken to defendants, have I given them a hug, perhaps,\" he says. \"Not given a bible, that\u2019s not me, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything inappropriate about what she did, and I would support that, if anyone tried to file a complaint, I would do my best to intercede and protect her.\u201d\n\nKemp, through her office, has declined to comment to local media about the incident.\n\nIn the 2018 killing, Guyger said she had parked on the wrong level of her apartment building's parking garage by mistake and walked down a corridor to the apartment directly above hers, thinking it was her own. She became worried when she noticed the door was unlocked, she said.", "description": "The Freedom from Religion Foundation has filed a complaint after Texas Judge Tammy Kemp gave Amber Guyger a Bible after being convicted of murder", "authors": ["Doug Stanglin", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aM0trawm3NuPESwKaXQlbA--~B/aD00MTkxO3c9NjA0MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/77bf59c7cfdfe117abfb59fa522ca1e2", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
