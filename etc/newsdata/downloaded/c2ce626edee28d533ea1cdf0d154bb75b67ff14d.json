Charles would have a hard time with a fraud case 'cause he didn't do any due diligence.\"\n\nThen, Giuliani said, \"Let's get back to business ... I gotta get you to get on Bahrain,\" apparently referring to his business dealings in the Middle Eastern nation.\n\nAfter his tenure as mayor of New York City ended in 2001, Giuliani founded a security-consulting company and did work in foreign countries, including Bahrain.\n\nThen, Giuliani asked if someone named Robert was around. When the other person said Robert was in Turkey, Giuliani responded, \"The problem is we need some money,\" and \"we need a few hundred thousand.\"\n\nWhile it wasn't clear from the voicemail alone, Schapiro guessed that Giuliani could have been referring to Robert Mangas, an attorney and registered foreign agent who lobbies on behalf of the Turkish government.\n\nThe October 17 incident wasn't the first time Giuliani \u2014 who has been known to pocket- and butt-dial other reporters \u2014 had butt-dialed Schapiro.\n\nSchapiro recounted how in late September, at a relative's birthday party, Giuliani also butt-dialed him, and \"amid his 3-year-old daughter's excitement, the reporter decided to let Giuliani's call go to his voicemail.\"\n\nWhen Schapiro later listened to Giuliani's voicemail, Giuliani ranted for three minutes about being \"the target of attacks\" for his allegations that former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter have engaged in corrupt activity overseas.\n\n\"There's plenty more to come out,\" Giuliani said in the voicemail, according to Schapiro. \"He did the same thing in China. And he tried to do it in Kazakhstan and in Russia.\"\n\n\"It's a sad situation,\" Giuliani added. \"You know how they get? Biden has been been trading in on his public office since he was a senator.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time the former New York mayor has butt-dialed a reporter. Early last year, he accidentally called Insider's Sonam Sheth and was overheard yelling about John Dowd, who at the time was Trump's personal attorney in the Russia probe, with an unidentified woman.\n\nGiuliani is Trump's personal lawyer and not a government official, but he has found himself at the center of the complicated impeachment inquiry into the Trump administration.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was kicked off with an explosive whistleblower complaint, which mentioned Giuliani 31 times and described him as a \"central figure\" in the administration's efforts to encourage Ukraine to investigate the Bidens over the corruption allegations.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint said \u2014 and Giuliani has acknowledged \u2014 that Trump and State Department officials enlisted him as a type of nonstate envoy to work with the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens, which included meeting with an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Andriy Yermak.\n\nGiuliani and Trump have alleged, without evidence, that as vice president, Biden tried to help his son by calling for the firing of Viktor Shokin, a prosecutor investigating Burisma. Giuliani has defended himself by saying he got involved only because State Department officials asked him to.\n\nBut The Wall Street Journal and other outlets have reported that Shokin was accused of being soft on corruption and hampering investigations, including the one into Burisma \u2014 in essence, Biden, and much of the international community, urged Shokin's ouster because he was ineffective.\n\nIn the September voicemail, Schapiro said Giuliani repeated the unsubstantiated allegations that the Bidens are corrupt and lamented that Hunter Biden took advantage of his famous name to land lucrative jobs.\n\n\"His son altogether made somewhere between 5 and 8 million,\" Giuliani said, without evidence. \"A 3 million transaction was laundered, which is illegal.\"\n\n\"When he became vice president, the kid decided to go around the world and say, 'Hire me because I'm Joe Biden's son.' And most people wouldn't hire him because he had a drug problem,\" Giuliani said, referencing Hunter Biden's struggles with substance abuse.\n\nNow Giuliani himself faces legal jeopardy for his back-channel campaign to influence Ukraine to open investigations.\n\nFormer prosecutors interviewed by Insider argued that Giuliani's collaboration with the Trump administration in pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens could violate the Logan Act, the Hobbs Act, or federal campaign-finance laws \u2014 and could even rise to the level of a bribery scheme if Trump were found to have leveraged military aid in exchange for investigations.\n\nOn October 14, The Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors in New York \u2014 with the office Giuliani directed in the 1980s as US attorney for the Southern District of New York \u2014 have seized Giuliani's bank and business records in connection with the investigation and arrested his associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.\n\nOn Friday, Politico reported that federal prosecutors in the Department of Justice's criminal-justice branch have \"taken an interest\" in also investigating Giuliani's foreign activities.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump's attorney Rudy Giuliani is looking for a new lawyer, report says, after abruptly parting ways with his last one in the middle of the Ukraine scandal\n\n3 big reasons why Rudy Giuliani is the weakest link in Trump's inner circle as the Ukraine scandal widens\n\nRudy Giuliani asked the State Department to grant visa to former Ukrainian official who said he had info about Democrats\n\n8 Trump officials made stunning revelations about how the president and Giuliani weaponized the State Department\n\nSonam Sheth contributed to this report.", "description": "NBC News reporter Rich Schapiro was the recipient of two butt-dialed voicemails from Giuliani discussing his foreign business dealings and the Bidens.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c77c1e22628982f9c4d8845?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
