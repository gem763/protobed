Scrappy. Gritty. Tenacious. And downright gutsy.\n\nYou'll run out of words to describe the never-give-up effort by Canadian Bianca Andreescu on Thursday night in New York.\n\nDown 2-5 in the second set, broken three times, exhausted and against the ropes, Andreescu won five straight games to defeat Switzerland's Belinda Bencic 7-6 (3), 7-5 and punch her ticket to the U.S. Open final on Saturday. It's the first time ever a Canadian singles tennis player will play for a U.S. Open title.\n\nWatch highlights from Andreescu's historic semifinal win:\n\nBianca Andreescu beat Belinda Bencic 7-6(3), 7-5 to advance to her 1st career Grand Slam final. The U.S. Open final will be a rematch of last month's Rogers Cup final in which Andreescu won after Serena Williams retired. 2:22\n\nAndreescu, 19, stood near the net inside Arthur Ashe Stadium after the victory, smiling and soaking up the moment as the crowd roared. She was nearly speechless during the post-match interview on the court.\n\n\"If someone told me a year ago I'd be in the U.S. Open final, I'd say you're crazy,\" the Mississauga, Ont., native said. \"I think it's just all the hard work.\"\n\n\"It's just crazy what a year can do,\" she added at a post-match news conference.\n\nAndreescu has spoken a lot about how much emphasis she puts into her mental game \u2014 she's made meditation and visualization a part of her daily practice. She believes being able to keep her head in the game is just as important as the physical component.\n\nMaybe that explains why the young Canadian has been able to remain so calm in some of the most intense moments at the U.S. Open.\n\nAll she needs in a match is a small flicker of hope \u2014 and she found one down 2-5 with Bencic serving for the second set. Bencic coughed up two double-faults and Andreescu pounced.\n\nShe was relentless the rest of the way to victory, breaking Bencic four times in the second set. It was a stunning twist.\n\nAndreescu battled back from deficits in both sets to defeat the No. 13 seed Bencic. (Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Associated Press)\n\nWhat's even more impressive about Andreescu's ability to rally when it looked as though the match was headed to a third set is the fact she was playing just 24 hours after Wednesday night's three-set quarter-final win over Elise Mertens. In fact, it marked eight sets played by Andreescu going back to Monday night.\n\nConsidering her unshakeable poise on the court, it's hard to fathom that this is Andreescu's first-ever appearance at the U.S. Open.\n\n\"I've always dreamed of this moment. I don't think many people would have thought it would become a reality,\" she said.\n\nThe higher the stakes, the more stressful the moment, the better Andreescu plays.\n\n\"I don't like to lose,\" she said. \"I just try my best every match. I expect a lot from myself so I think pressure also helps me do my best in matches.\"\n\nHoudini act in the 1st set\n\nFor the second-straight night at the tournament, Andreescu didn't play her best tennis to start the match.\n\nBencic had break point after break point, but was unable to capitalize on her opportunities throughout much of the first set.\n\nBencic misses a shot from Andreescu. (Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Associated Press)\n\nBack and forth the two went, trading games and shots that led to a first-set tiebreak.\n\nThat's when Andreescu raised her game and won a 7-3 tiebreak victory.\n\nAgain, when she needed her best tennis, Andreescu stepped up. She had 20 unforced errors and five double-faults \u2014 and yet, she walked away with the first set.\n\nRogers Cup final rematch\n\nIt sets up a brilliant U.S. Open final on Saturday, as Andreescu draws 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams, who defeated Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 6-3, 6-1 earlier on Thursday. Just last month, their Rogers Cup final matchup in Toronto ended abruptly when the 37-year-old Williams retired four games in due to a back injury.\n\nThat was when the two had an on-court exchange that sent Andreescu's star into greater orbit. She rushed over to Williams to ensure she was OK \u2014 even dropping a few expletives that made Williams laugh in what was an emotional moment.\n\nWatch Andreescu console Williams after the tennis icon retired from the Rogers Cup final:\n\nBianca Andreescu and Serena Williams shared an emotional embrace after Williams was forced to retire from the Rogers Cup final due to injury. Andreescu is the first Canadian woman to win the Rogers Cup since Faye Urban in 1969. 2:14\n\nIn her post-match interview, Williams called Andreescu an \"old soul\" because of her poise and respect.\n\nAnd now this.\n\nAndreescu has played a lot of tennis this week at the U.S. Open. (Mike Stobe/Getty Images)\n\nTwenty years ago, a teenage Williams won her first of six U.S. Open singles titles. Now, she'll take on a Canadian teen \u2014 who wasn't even born when that 1999 victory happened \u2014 looking to win her first major.\n\n\"It's just surreal. I don't know what to say,\" Andreescu said. \"It's just a dream come true.\"\n\nAndreescu's dream season keeps on rolling. She's now 44-4 on the season, including a Tour-best 30 wins on the hard court.\n\nTo be the best, she'll have to beat the best in the stadium Williams has won 101 matches, tied for most-ever at the U.S. Open.\n\nAnd you get the sense the fearless Andreescu is more than ready for the challenge.", "description": "Bianca Andreescu has become the first Canadian to reach a singles final at the U.S. Open, defeating Switzerland's Belinda Bencic\u00a07-6 (3), 7-5 in the semifinals on Thursday.", "authors": ["Cbc Reporter", "Devin Heroux Reports For Cbc News", "Sports.
