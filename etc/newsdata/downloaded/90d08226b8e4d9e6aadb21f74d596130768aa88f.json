I knew going into X Factor [meant] anything could happen and the level of talent was so high this year!\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity as it has completely pushed me out of my comfort zone, reminding myself I love to be up on that stage. That being said, yes my elimination came as a shock.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"It was a punch in the gut. People have emotions and mine got the best of me...because I REALLY wanted this. I\u2019m proud of my performance last night and that\u2019s what matters to me. Good luck to all my new friends I\u2019ve made a long the way. OO out!\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nTalkshow legend Ricki was also kicked out of the competition immediately after receiving the fewest votes from the public.\n\nThe judges were then given the power to save one of the remaining pair - with Simon casting the deciding vote and sending Olivia home.\n\nInconsolable Olivia was left in floods of tears and was told by host Dermot O'Leary to \"hold it together\".\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nWhen asked how she was feeling, Olivia could barely speak and muttered: \"Not great.\"\n\nThere were boos ringing around the studio when Simon decided to send Olivia home and save Martin.\n\nGiving his verdict, Simon said: \"I think you're both in this situation because of song choices. Being impartial, I\u2019m making this decision on who I believe the public would like to see through to next week.\n\n\"Based on that reason the person I\u2019m sending home is, unfortunately, Olivia.\"", "description": "Olivia Olson has described being booted off X Factor: Celebrity as a \"punch in the gut\"", "authors": ["Lucy Buckland", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20733569.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-X-Factor-Olivia-leaves.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
