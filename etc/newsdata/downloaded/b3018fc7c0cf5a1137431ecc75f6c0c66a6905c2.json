From her \u2018Green New Deal\u2019 proposal to combat climate change to her clapbacks against Trump and her critics, here\u2019s how AOC danced her way into the spotlight. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. shot back after a story in the conservative Washington Times criticized her for a \"high-dollar hairdo.\"\n\n\"40 million Americans live in poverty under today\u2019s extreme inequality, yet the right-wing want you to blame Democratic socialism for their own moral failures. Our policies, like Medicare for All, advance prosperity for working people,\" wrote Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\"They're just mad we look good doing it,\" she added, with the hair-flip emoji.\n\nShe later tweeted another response to the story with criticism of Vice President Mike Pence's stay at a Trump Organization-owned resort in Ireland.\n\n\"Won\u2019t you look at that: Mike Pence used *taxpayer funds* - not personal ones - to spend several thousand haircuts\u2019 worth of public money on a visit to Trump golf courses. I wonder if Republicans care about corruption as much as they care about a woman\u2019s cut & color,\" she wrote.\n\n40 million Americans live in poverty under today\u2019s extreme inequality, yet the right-wing want you to blame Democratic socialism for their own moral failures.\n\n\n\nOur policies, like Medicare for All, advance prosperity for working people.\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re just mad we look good doing it \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f https://t.co/l9gKGtyKra \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 10, 2019\n\nWon\u2019t you look at that: Mike Pence used *taxpayer funds* - not personal ones - to spend several thousand haircuts\u2019 worth of public money on a visit to Trump golf courses.\n\n\n\nI wonder if Republicans care about corruption as much as they care about a woman\u2019s cut & color. https://t.co/xBze4obZhv \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 10, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday, the Washington Times had published a story quoting \"sources familiar\" with Ocasio-Cortez's hair salon in Washington, D.C. The article estimated Ocasio-Cortez spent $300 on her haircut, lowlights, and the tip.\n\n\u201cAOC is the Eva Peron of American politics. She preaches socialism while living the life of the privileged,\u201d said Richard Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, to the Washington Times. Manning was making a reference to Argentinian political leader Eva Per\u00f3n, who served as the First Lady of Argentina from 1946 to 1952.\n\nMore: Fringe group claims it planned 'eat the babies' stunt at AOC town hall\n\nMore: Two Rudy Giuliani associates who once dined with Trump and Trump Jr. arrested\n\nOcasio-Cortez had quoted a tweet from Jacobin, a leftist magazine, about the article.\n\n\"Sad to see democratic socialists like Bernie and @AOC do things like buy winter coats and get haircuts.
