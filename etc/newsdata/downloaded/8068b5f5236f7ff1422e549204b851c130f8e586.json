One of the companies believed to be at the forefront of a spike in e-cigarette use, Juul, has suspended sales of its fruity flavors. Meanwhile, multiple states have begun enacting their own vaping bans, and First Lady Melania Trump has hosted a forum on vaping with teens at the White House.\n\nBut as lawmakers and regulatory agencies scramble to figure out what exactly went wrong, health officials are focused on what can be done to stop it. On Thursday afternoon, that mission took on new urgency with the release of new numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which show the total number of lung injury cases linked to e-cigarettes or vaping products has now reached 1,479, extending to every state but Alaska. Perhaps most alarmingly, the death rate for the illness continues to climb, with the CDC confirming 33 deaths in 24 states thus far. The vast majority of those affected remain male (70 percent) and close to 80 percent are under 35.\n\nAs of this week, the CDC has officially given the illness a name: EVALI, which stands for e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury. Doctors say the illness can resemble pneumonia, with common symptoms including severe cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills. In the majority of cases, those who have experienced the illness felt a sudden onset of symptoms so severe that it led to hospitalization.\n\nOn Tuesday, the New York Times shared the story of a 22-year-old college student who found himself on \u201cthe verge of death\u201d after smoking THC vape products from the dark web. \u201cIt was terrible,\u201d the student\u2019s mother told the Times. \u201cI will never forget the doctor\u2019s face. I prayed, \u2018Please, God, don\u2019t let him go.\u2019\u201d Another student in Colorado shared a similar story with CBS \u201cThis Morning\u201d In September, saying that vaping is not worth \u201cseeing your parents cry as you are in a hospital bed.\u201d\n\nA new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 1,479 cases of vaping illness, with 33 deaths, as Juul announces it will be suspending sales of its fruity flavors.

And even while we learn more, we need to take steps to prevent additional cases. We are not seeing a meaningful drop-off in new cases.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds 1,479 cases of vaping-related illness, with 33 deaths, as Juul announces it will be suspending sales of its fruity flavors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/j_aLUU81vcLHY1vXh4GxTg--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/340dfba0-e083-11e9-ba4b-d5b1ec3f2971", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
