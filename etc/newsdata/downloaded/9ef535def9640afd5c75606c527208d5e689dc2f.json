The hunter gatherer lifestyle vanished as people grew crops and domesticated animals.\n\nHumans began consuming dairy products about 6,000 years ago, but very little is known about the diet of ancient infants.\n\nPast evidence has suggested prehistoric infants were likely given some sort of baby food in addition to breast milk after six months, but their diet was unknown.\n\nImage copyright Nature Image caption Modern day baby feeding from reconstructed vessel\n\nArchaeologists turned to ceramics for the answer, specifically spouted pottery vessels dating back to more than 5,000 years ago.\n\nThey tested the contents of three small \"bottles\" that had been buried alongside infants in graves from the Bronze Age and Iron Age (between 1,200 and 450 BC).\n\nMolecular fingerprints revealed fats from animal products, including fresh milk.\n\nGiving milk in this way would have had its risks as the hard-to-clean bottles could have exposed babies to infection.\n\nBut switching away from breast feeding may have had a fertility effect, contributing to the population explosion around this time.\n\nCommenting on the study, published in the journal, Nature, Sian Halcrow of the University of Otago, New Zealand, said further work was needed to explore the effects of introducing animal milk as an infant food.\n\n\"Such knowledge, together with evidence of disease for the individual being studied, might help to provide a greater understanding of the significance of animal milk for the lives of ancient children.\"\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter.\n\n.", "description": "Prehistoric babies were bottle-fed with animal milk more than 3,000 years ago, according to new evidence.", "authors": ["Helen Briggs"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1060D/production/_108958076_prehistoricfamilyscenecaption4christianbisig-carchologiederschweiz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
