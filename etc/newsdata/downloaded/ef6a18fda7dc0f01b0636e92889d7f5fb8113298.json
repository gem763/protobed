Photo: Kieran Frost/Redferns\n\nCharli XCX is a trailblazer, a songwriter to the stars and a pop soothsayer holding the necessary skills to scale the top of the charts, the reach to get booked for tours with the likes of Taylor Swift, and the taste to know what great music is bubbling on the horizon. She gave Iggy Azalea\u2019s \u201cFancy\u201d its wings. She co-wrote the Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes single that\u2019s got the pair acting out online (as well as inescapable tunes like Madison Beer\u2019s \u201cHurts Like Hell,\u201d Icona Pop\u2019s \u201cI Love It,\u201d and Iggy\u2019s \u201cBeg for It\u201d). She gave The Fault in Our Stars its signature tune. Charli helped map out musical blueprints that would be adopted by all of the dance-pop closers of this era; one wonders whether Taylor having her open on the Reputation trek was paying it forward for the influence of songs like \u201cYou (Ha Ha)\u201d on the architecture of 1989. Charli is a risk-taker and a serial early adopter of trends that go supernova in her wake; naming 2017\u2019s late-year sidewinder Pop 2 is surely a wink at the obvious, a preening notice to the competition to catch up.\n\nCharli\u2019s engaged in a precarious juggling act, tracking pop\u2019s mainstream while courting the favor of the gifted oddballs dragging the music leftward and being truly present online whether things are going great for her or not. You might see her post a Brat-doll version of her album artwork, and you might hear about how she sometimes wishes she could write songs without the burden of performing them. Getting any good at writing these days means fostering the necessary introversion to spell out what\u2019s going on inside your head and then summoning the gall to show your work to others and the reserve to explain and defend yourself afterward. It is emotionally expensive behavior. You can hear pop stars working out the costs of fame in songs like Bebe Rexha\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m a Mess,\u201d Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201cFake Smile,\u201d and Shawn Mendes\u2019s \u201cIn My Blood.\u201d You can see hip-hop artists bristle at the expectation of omnipresence in interviews and in songs like Post Malone\u2019s \u201cInternet.\u201d Post and Kanye moving from industry-adjacent homes in the Los Angeles area to rustic Midwest expanses while Lana Del Rey muses on record about wanting to disappear into middle age in the comfort of the valley is proof positive that the girls are tired.\n\nXCX\u2019s third album, Charli, is fishscale anxiety-pop. It\u2019s music for the party and for the internal dialogue happening in your head while you shuffle through the masses trying to keep up appearances. \u201cGone\u201d is the most euphoric song about stress-drinking to get over feeling alone in a crowd in a year chock-full of them. \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Know\u201d is a love song about worrying that you\u2019re losing someone, but rather than taking the accusatory tone that a tune about the decay of trust in a relationship would normally occupy, it lists its fears and ultimately decides not to bring them up. \u201cThoughts\u201d spirals on the road out west, like Kanye\u2019s \u201cNo More Parties in L.A.\u201d: \u201cDid I lose it all? Did I fuck it up? / Are my friends really friends now? / Or are they far gone?\u201d Charli\u2019s specific magic is making these missives soar. The singer glides into her upper register with the effortless ease of early Rihanna. You nearly forget \u201cCross You Out\u201d is about a breakup as the vocal skips around octaves in the chorus. The upbeat stuff\u2019s just as solid. Charli splits the difference between beguilingly catchy songs about sadness and elite dance-floor fodder where the singer plays Words With Friends with a Who\u2019s Who of modern oddball pop and electronic music.\n\nHelming the majority of the production on Charli is PC Music label founder A.G. Cook, with assistance from a worldwide network of talent, including French producer N\u00f6mak, Swedish songwriter and beat-maker Lotus IV, pop session whiz watt, and Dylan Brady of noise-pop freaks 100 Gecs. Together, they gift Charli a sound that\u2019s catchy but also confrontational. Like rock candy, these songs are sweet but sharp around the edges. The synth hits from \u201cGone\u201d are percussive enough to fill out spaces in the drum pattern in the chorus. The braying keys buttressing Charli\u2019s flights in \u201cThoughts\u201d are what the fanfare at a robot\u2019s funeral might sound like. \u201cClick\u201d could pass for a Space Invaders arcade cabinet tumbling down a flight of stairs. \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Know\u201d introduces an \u201980s feel with a dollop of gated reverb. Fun-house vocal effects keep Charli and her rotating cast of friends sounding freshly outrageous on each song. A dab of Auto-Tune turns the killer Kim Petras verse in \u201cClick\u201d into a mindfuck. The Troye Sivan appearance in \u201c2099\u201d doubles down on the natural ghostly wispiness of his voice; bookending the confectionary \u201c1999,\u201d you can almost imagine \u201c2099\u201d as an artifact unearthed in a distant future.\n\nThese are all ideas you could hear coming together in a succession of envelope-pushing albums like Sophie\u2019s Oil of Every Pearl\u2019s Un-Sides, 100 Gecs\u2019s 1000 Gecs (and by extension, Sleigh Bells\u2019 Treats), Flume\u2019s Skin, Rustie\u2019s Glass Swords, and even Charli\u2019s own Pop 2, but the audacity to present this stuff as straight-up pop music \u2014 and to go get Lizzo, Haim, Sky Ferreira, Troye Sivan, and Big Freedia to sing over the stuff \u2014 is a new and noble enterprise. Charli is a Trojan horse. The weird kids are crashing the party, and making great music about how the party sucks. That\u2019s a delightful change of pace.", "description": "Charli is a Trojan horse.
