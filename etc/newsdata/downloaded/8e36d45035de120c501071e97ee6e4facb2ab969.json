Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said trade wars and Brexit uncertainty had weighed on business investment but that the US economy had stayed \u201cresilient.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe took this step to help keep the US economy strong in the face of global developments and to provide some insurance against ongoing risks,\u201d Powell said.\n\nStocks were little changed before the Fed announcement but pushed higher after the central bank released its decision at 1800 GMT. The S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent, rising to 3,046.77 and scoring its second record in three days.\n\nEarlier, European stocks finished mixed while bourses in Asia retreated.\n\n\u201cThe street got very much what they expected and therefore is breathing a sigh of relief,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.\n\nThe dollar retreated against the euro and the pound.\n\nShaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank, cited Powell\u2019s comments on low inflation, which suggested the US central bank would not be in a rush to hike interest rates.\n\n\u201cThe market was concerned about interest rates rising again in 2020,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cIt has calmed the concern for the time being.\u201d\n\nNews that auto giants Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot-maker Groupe PSA were in talks on a possible $50-billion (45-billion-euro) mega merger sparked local interest, with both shares making sharp gains.\n\nIn Paris, PSA rallied 5.4 percent while in Milan Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) surged 10 percent.\n\nA merger would bring PSA access to the lucrative US market, while helping it survive the twin impact of the global economic slowdown and trade war worries, analysts said.\n\nA source familiar with the matter told AFP on Wednesday afternoon that the board of PSA had approved the proposed tie-up but that the deal still needs to be given the green light by FCA\u2019s board.\n\nAmong other companies, General Electric shot up 11.5 percent after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter profits and boosting some of its financial targets despite reporting another large loss.\n\nBoeing dropped 0.8 percent after Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg endured another grilling on Capitol Hill over the company\u2019s development of the 737 MAX, which has been grounded following two fatal crashes. At least two lawmakers called for Muilenburg to resign over the crisis.\n\n\u2013 Key figures around 2100 GMT \u2013\n\nNew York \u2013 Dow: UP 0.4 percent at 27,186.69 (close)\n\nNew York \u2013 S&P 500: UP 0.3 percent at 3,046.77 (close)\n\nNew York \u2013 Nasdaq: UP 0.3 percent at 8,303.98 (close)\n\nLondon \u2013 FTSE 100: UP 0.3 percent at 7,330.78 (close)\n\nFrankfurt \u2013 DAX 30: DOWN 0.2 percent at 12,910.23 (close)\n\nParis \u2013 CAC 40: UP 0.5 percent at 5,765.87 (close)\n\nEURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.1 percent at 3,620.29 (close)\n\nTokyo \u2013 Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.6 percent at 22,843.12 (close)\n\nHong Kong \u2013 Hang Seng: DOWN 0.4 percent at 26,667.71 (close)\n\nShanghai \u2013 Composite: DOWN 0.5 percent at 2939,32 (close)\n\nPound/dollar: UP at $1.2899 from $1.2862 at 2100 GMT\n\nEuro/pound: UP at 86.42 pence from 86.40 pence\n\nEuro/dollar: UP at $1.1149 from $1.1112\n\nDollar/yen: DOWN at 108.85 yen from 108.89 yen\n\nBrent North Sea crude: DOWN 1.6 percent at $60.61 per barrel\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 0.9 percent at $55.06 per barrel\n\nburs-jmb/dg", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Wall Street stocks rallied and the dollar retreated Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates and signaled it expects", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/bfe857_federal-reserve-board-chairman-jerome-powell-signaled-fed-expects-hold-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
