The Fed lowered borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008.\n\n\"The winds of recession aren't coming closer to shore if the consumer continues to buy their hearts out,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG. \"Fed officials are unlikely to cut rates too much deeper as they seek to get out in front of the risks the economy faces acting early instead of being too late.\"\n\nRetail sales rose 0.4% last month, lifted by spending on motor vehicles, building materials, healthcare and hobbies. Data for August was revised slightly up to show retail sales increasing 0.8% instead of 0.7% as previously reported.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would gain 0.2% in August. Compared to August last year, retail sales advanced 4.1%. Retail sales have increased for six straight months, the longest such stretch since June 2017.\n\nBut with the Trump administration this month slapping a 15% tariff on Chinese consumer goods such as televisions, apparel, bed linens, smart watches and footwear, there are concerns retail sales could pull back. Economists and retail groups expect businesses will pass on the duties to consumers, thereby raising prices for the targeted goods.\n\n\"It is too early to assess the impact of the new tariffs that took effect at the beginning of this month, but they do present downside risks to household spending,\" said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation in Washington.\n\nHouseholds' worries about the new round of tariffs were also underscored by a small rise in consumer sentiment early this month. The University of Michigan said its survey of consumers found that concerns about the impact of tariffs on the economy rose in early September.\n\nExcluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales climbed 0.3% last month after increasing by a slightly downwardly revised 0.9% in July. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously reported to have jumped 1.0% in July.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, increased at a 4.7% annualized rate in the second quarter, the most in 4-1/2 years.\n\nEconomists expect consumer spending will slow to just below a 4.0% rate in the third quarter, which would be more than enough to keep the economy growing at a steady pace, rather than tipping into recession as signaled by financial markets.\n\nThe dollar <.DXY> was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Major U.S. stock indexes were largely unchanged.\n\n\n\n\n\nGROWTH LOCOMOTIVE\n\n\"The trend in consumer spending growth still looks very solid,\" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. \"Consumers remain the locomotive of the economy.\"\n\nStrong consumer spending is encouraging retailers to boost inventory. A second report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed business inventories increased 0.4% in July after being unchanged in June. Stocks at retailers rebounded 0.8%, the most in six months, after falling 0.2% in June.\n\nThe inventory increase bodes well for GDP growth this quarter. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting the economy to grow at a 1.8% rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 2.0% rate in the April-June quarter, down from the first quarter's brisk 3.1% pace.\n\nFinancial markets have fully priced in a rate cut at the Fed's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting. Most economists expect additional monetary policy easing in October and December. While underlying consumer prices have accelerated in the past three months, inflation is likely to remain benign.\n\nStory continues", "description": "U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in August, pointing to solid consumer spending that should continue to support a moderate pace of economic growth.
