(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Former top officials of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are assailing the agency for undermining its weather forecasters as it defends President Donald Trump's statement from days ago that Hurricane Dorian threatened Alabama.\n\nThey say NOAA's action risks the credibility of the nation's weather and science agency and may even risk lives.\n\nDismay came from those who served under Republican and Democratic presidents alike as leaders in meteorology and disaster response sized up a sustained effort by Trump and his aides to justify his warning that Alabama, among other states, was \"most likely\" to be hit hard by Dorian, contrary to forecasts showing Alabama was clear.\n\nThat effort led NOAA to repudiate a tweet from the National Weather Service the previous weekend assuring Alabamans \u2014 accurately \u2014 that they had nothing to fear from the hurricane. The weather service is part of NOAA and the tweet came from its Birmingham, Alabama, office.\n\n\"This rewriting history to satisfy an ego diminishes NOAA,\" Elbert \"Joe\" Friday, former Republican-appointed director of the National Weather Service, said on Facebook. He told The Associated Press on Saturday: \"We don't want to get the point where science is determined by politics rather than science and facts. And I'm afraid this is an example where this is beginning to occur.\"\n\nAlabama had never been included in hurricane advisories and Trump's information, based on less authoritative graphics than an official forecast, was outdated even at the time.\n\nIn the tempestuous aftermath, some meteorologists spoke on social media of protesting when the acting NOAA chief, Neil Jacobs , is scheduled to speak at a National Weather Association meeting Tuesday \u2014 in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nFormer officials saw a political hand at work in NOAA's statement disavowing the Birmingham tweet. The statement was issued by an anonymous \"spokesperson,\" a departure from the norm for federal agencies that employ people to speak for them by name.\n\n\"This falls into such uncharted territory,\" said W. Craig Fugate, who was Florida emergency management chief under Republican Gov. Jeb Bush and director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency under Democratic President Barack Obama. \"You have science organizations putting out statements against their own offices. For the life of me I don't think I would have ever faced this under President Obama or Governor Bush.\"\n\nJane Lubchenco, NOAA administrator during the Obama administration said: \"It is truly sad to see political appointees undermining the superb, life-saving work of NOAA's talented and dedicated career servants. Scientific integrity at a science agency matters.\"\n\nThe White House declined to comment Saturday when asked if it had directed NOAA to release the statement. NOAA officials also didn't respond to requests for comment. After spending the morning at his Virginia golf club, Trump tweeted that he'd like to move on from the matter but the news media \"won't leave it alone.\"\n\nIn an effort to address the wounds, leaders at the National Weather Service on Saturday sent a memo to employees praising their work and asserting that \"we continue to embrace and uphold the essential integrity of the entire forecast process as it was applied by ALL NWS offices,\" an emphasis no doubt directed at forecasters chastised by the NOAA statement.\n\nRetired Adm. David Titley, former NOAA operations chief during the Obama administration and a former meteorology professor at Pennsylvania State University said NOAA's leadership showed \"moral cowardice\" and officials should have resigned instead of issuing the statement. Joe Friday said he would have quit had he been in top officials' shoes.\n\nTitley said the episode might feed distrust of forecasts that help people make life-or-death decisions whether to evacuate.\n\n\"For people who look for excuses not to take action when their lives or property are threatened ... I think this can potentially feed that,\" Titley said.\n\nFormer NOAA deputy administration Monica Medina, who served in the Obama and Clinton administrations, said \"it will make us less safe as a country.\"\n\nAnd Justin Kenney, who headed the agency's communications in the Obama administration, said \"by politicizing weather forecasts, the president ... puts more people \u2014 including first responders \u2014 in harm's way.\"", "description": "Former top officials of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are assailing the agency for undermining its weather forecasters as it defends President Donald Trump's statement from days ago that Hurricane Dorian threatened Alabama.
