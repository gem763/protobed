They agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal,\u2019 the statement said.\n\n\u2018They agreed to reflect further on their discussions and that officials would continue to engage intensively on them.\u2019\n\nThe leaders met at the Thornton Manor Hotel near Birkenhead (Picture: AFP)\n\nIn a joint statement they said they would now \u2018reflect further\u2019 on their discussions (Picture: PA)\n\nDelegates will now \u2018continue to engage intensively\u2019 on the matters raised (Picture: AFP)\n\nThe meeting at the 19th century Thornton Manor was seen as a last chance for Mr Johnson to save his hopes of getting agreement on a Brexit deal ahead of next week\u2019s crucial EU summit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their statement, the two leaders said their discussions had concentrated on the \u2018challenges\u2019 of future customs arrangements and \u2018consent\u2019 in Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit blueprint.\n\nThe Irish and other EU governments have objected to proposals taking Northern Ireland out of the EU customs union meaning the return of mainland border checks.\n\nThey have also voiced strong concern about proposals in the plan for the new arrangements to require the consent of the Stormont Assembly, effectively handing a veto to the DUP.\n\nThe statement said Mr Varadkar will now consult with Brussels while Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will meet the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Friday.\n\nThe cautiously upbeat statement comes at the end of a week marked by acrimonious exchanges between London, Dublin and Brussels in which negotiations appeared close to collapse.\n\nBriefings by anonymous No 10 sources accused Mr Varadkar of backtracking on previous commitments to try to find a deal and of refusing to negotiate.\n\nAnd following a heated telephone call between Mr Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday, they claimed the EU was making it \u2018essentially impossible\u2019 for Britain to leave with a deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there is no agreement, Mr Johnson will face demands to comply with the so-called Benn Act requiring him to go back to Brussels and request a further Brexit delay.\n\nThe PM has said that while he will abide by the law, he is determined to leave on the Halloween deadline come what may.\n\nGovernment sources have said ministers are preparing to hold an emergency Saturday sitting of Parliament on October 19.\n\nMany MPs believe that if no deal is reached, Mr Johnson will use the occasion to lambast them for thwarting an agreement, laying the ground for a \u2018people versus Parliament\u2019 general election.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
