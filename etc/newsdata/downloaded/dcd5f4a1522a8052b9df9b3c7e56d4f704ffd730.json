The club didn\u2019t introduce me to the players they thought could help us so without that it\u2019s not going to happen.\n\n\u201cOur need is not just for six months it\u2019s for a long time and the important players will not be sold. We are going to stay all the season, I think, with all the players we have right now.\u201d\n\nWith Rodri having played at centre-half in the past two games until injuring his hamstring against Atalanta in midweek, the emphasis would appear to be on Stones to remain fit and re-establish himself as a starter with City.\n\nHowever, injuries meant the England international has not started consecutive games since February and Stones was in Guardiola\u2019s bad books this week after he was not ready to come on as a substitute against Atalanta.\n\nTV images showed Guardiola\u2019s anger at his player and the City manager was still irritated by the incident when asked on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe guys on the bench know you have to be ready to go out from the first minute,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you see the image? So it speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nZinchenko, injured during the last international window with Ukraine, underwent minor knee surgery in Spain this week and is expected to be out for up to six weeks.\n\nHis absence will leave the left-back position open for French international Mendy, whose own City career has been plagued by serious knee problems.\n\n\u201cHe played 90 minutes at Crystal Palace and on Tuesday too, playing 70-75 minutes incredibly against Atalanta and he\u2019s not injured,\u201d Guardiola said of Mendy.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s coming that he can play regularly. Games, games, games and he will get to his best level.\n\n\u201cStill he is not on the level that we believe he can do it but that\u2019s normal. After two seasons out, he needs time\u201d\n\nThe long list of problems has tested Guardiola\u2019s creativity and managerial skills to the full with the City manager having started the last two games with two central midfielders \u2014 Fernandinho and Rodri \u2014 at the heart of his defence.\n\n\u201cI would prefer it if all the players had no injuries but I have to do it,\u201d Guardiola added.\n\n\u201cI said when Laporte happened that it is what it is. We can\u2019t stop and complain, \u2018oh what bad luck.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe have good players in the squad. In a few positions there are not many but we have incredibly good players. We\u2019re going with them.\u201d", "description": "Manchester (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 Pep Guardiola insists Manchester City will not buy a player in the January transfer window despite admitting he", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/eb86a6_hamstrung-rodri-left-has-added-manchester-city-lengthy-injury-guardiola-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
