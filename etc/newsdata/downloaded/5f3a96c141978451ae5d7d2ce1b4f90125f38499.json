As soon as we find out definitively we\u2019ll let you know but it does look that way.\u201d\n\nThe attacks cut 5% of world crude oil production.\n\nTwo sources briefed on state oil company Saudi Aramco\u2019s operations told Reuters it might take months for Saudi oil production to return to normal. Earlier estimates had suggested it could take weeks.\n\nTension in the oil-producing Gulf region has dramatically escalated this year after Trump imposed severe U.S. sanctions on Iran aimed at halting its oil exports altogether.\n\nThe U.S. leader said he did not want to act hastily.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of options but I\u2019m not looking at options right now we want to find definitively who did this. We\u2019re dealing with Saudi Arabia. We\u2019re dealing with the crown prince and other of your neighbours. And we\u2019re all talking about it together. We\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m somebody that would like not to have war,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want war with anybody but we\u2019re prepared more than anybody.\u201d\n\nOil prices surged by as much as 19% after the incidents but later came off their peaks. The intraday jump was the biggest since the 1990-91 Gulf crisis over Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait.\n\nThe market eased from its peak after Trump announced that he would release U.S. emergency supplies and producers said there were enough stocks stored up worldwide to make up for the shortfall. Prices were around 12% higher by afternoon in the United States.\n\nSAUDI SUSPICIONS\n\nSaudi Arabia said the attacks were carried out with Iranian weapons, adding that it was capable of responding forcefully and urging U.N. experts to help investigate the raid.\n\nIn remarks reflecting Saudi suspicions that Tehran was responsible, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iranian threats were not only directed against the kingdom but against the Middle East and the world.\n\nWhile the prince did not directly accuse Tehran, a foreign ministry statement reported him as calling on the international community to condemn whoever was behind the strike.\n\n\u201cThe kingdom is capable of defending its land and people and responding forcefully to those attacks,\u201d the statement added.\n\nRouhani said the strike was carried out by \u201cYemeni people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYemeni people are exercising their legitimate right of defence,\u201d Rouhani told a joint news conference with his Russian and Turkish counterparts at a meeting in Ankara.\n\nU.N. Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths told the Security Council on Monday it was \u201cnot entirely clear\u201d who was behind the strike but he said it had increased the chances of a regional conflict.\n\nBut U.S. Ambassador to the world body, Kelly Craft, told the Council that emerging information on the attacks \u201cindicates that responsibility lies with Iran\u201d and that there is no evidence the attack came from Yemen.\n\nIran rejected U.S. accusations that it was responsible. \u201cThese allegations are condemned as unacceptable and entirely baseless,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said in remarks carried by state TV.\n\nThe kingdom said it would be able to meet oil customers\u2019 demand from its ample storage, although some deliveries had been disrupted. At least 11 supertankers were waiting to load oil cargoes from Saudi ports, ship tracking data showed on Monday.\n\nA satellite image showing damage to oil/gas Saudi Aramco infrastructure at Khurais, in Saudi Arabia in this handout picture released by the U.S Government September 15, 2019.

He added he was confident the oil market \u201cis resilient and will respond positively\u201d.\n\nIran\u2019s Yemeni allies have promised more strikes to come. Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said the group carried out Saturday\u2019s pre-dawn attack with drones, including some powered by jet engines.\n\n\u201cWe assure the Saudi regime that our long arm can reach any place we choose and at the time of our choosing,\u201d Sarea tweeted. \u201cWe warn companies and foreigners against being near the plants that we struck because they are still in our sights.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials say they believe that the attacks came from the opposite direction, possibly from Iran itself rather than Yemen, and may have involved cruise missiles. Wherever the attacks were launched, however, they believe Iran is to blame.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran have been enemies for decades and are fighting a number of proxy wars, including in Yemen where Saudi forces have been fighting against the Houthis for four years.\n\nTHREATS\n\nThe attacks have raised questions about how the kingdom, one of the world\u2019s top spenders on weaponry, much of it supplied by U.S. companies, was unable to protect oil plants from attack.\n\nAppearing to sense a commercial opening, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was ready to help Saudi Arabia by providing Russian-made air defence systems, which he said would protect any Saudi infrastructure.\n\nFor months, Iranian officials have issued veiled threats, saying that if Tehran is blocked from exporting oil, other countries will not be able to do so either. However, Iran has denied a role in specific attacks, including bombings of tankers in the Gulf and previous strikes claimed by the Houthis.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nRussia and China said it was wrong to jump to conclusions about who was to blame for the attack on Saudi Arabia.\n\nWashington has imposed its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy on Iran since last year when Trump quit an international deal that gave Tehran access to world trade in return for nuclear curbs.\n\nU.S. allies in Europe oppose Trump\u2019s strategy, arguing that it provides no clear mechanism to defuse tensions, creating a risk that the foes could stumble into war.\n\nTrump has said his goal is to force Iran to negotiate a tougher agreement and has left open the possibility of talks with Rouhani at an upcoming U.N. meeting. Iran says there can be no talks until Washington lifts sanctions.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said it looked like Iran was behind attacks on oil plants in Saudi Arabia at the weekend that raised fears of a fresh Middle East conflict, but added that he did not want war with anyone.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430586559&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F16X", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
