If found, the malware will terminate; if not, then the payload continues to execute.\n\nSystem data, including the country of the machine, processor type, PC vendor, name, and cache size is scraped. InnfiRAT will then contact its command-and-control (C2) server, transfer the stolen machine information, and await further instructions.\n\nAmong these instructions is the command to obtain a list of all running processes in an infected system, including those with the strings \"chrome,\" \"browser,\" \"firefox,\" and \"opera.\" The malware will terminate any that match.\n\nCNET: Spotify wants to know where you live and will be checking in\n\nInnfiRAT can deploy additional malicious payloads, steal files, and grab browser cookies to harvest stored username and password credentials for online services. In addition, the Trojan can screenshot open sessions and shut down traditional antivirus processes.\n\nIn the quest for cryptocurrency, InnfiRAT will scan for information relating to cryptocurrency including Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC) wallets by checking for %AppData%\\Litecoin\\wallet.dat and %AppData%\\Bitcoin\\wallet.dat. If they are present, the malware will siphon existing data that can be used to compromise these wallets and potentially steal virtual funds.\n\nCryptocurrency remains a lucrative channel for cybercriminals to generate illicit profit and InnfiRAT is only one of many forms of malware that now include cryptocurrency-related theft or exploit modules.\n\nTechRepublic: How data breaches are hurting small businesses\n\nPsiXBot has recently been upgraded to include Google's DNS over HTTPS service, and once on a target machine, will monitor the clipboard for wallet credentials used to store Bitcoin, Etherium, Monero, and Ripple.\n\nAnother interesting form of cryptojacking malware, dubbed Bird Miner, emulates Linux on Mac machines while running XMRig. The malware harnesses the CPU power of victims to covertly mine Monero (XMR) and sends the proceeds to wallets controlled by its operators.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
