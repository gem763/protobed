Now the Ashaninka and nearby Madija tribe have come under further pressure, as uncontacted Indians have been encroaching more and more on their territory.\n\nA group of Indians raise their spears and gaze upwards as they react to a plane flying over their community in the Amazon basin. They are members of an uncontacted tribe \u2013 defined by the rights organisation Survival International as a people who has no peaceful contact with mainstream society. Both the Ashaninka and neighbouring Madija tribe report that these unknown groups have been increasingly encroaching on their area over the past three years, creating a source of conflict in this part of the Amazon rainforest around the Envira River, close to the border with Peru.\n\nTxate (pictured above) is a 77-year-old leader of the Ashaninka tribe, and he is concerned about the incursions uncontacted Indians have made on his group\u2019s land. \u201cThey steal pots, knives, cloth. They live naked, speak another language and don\u2019t want to talk. They are at war with everyone. If they get close they shoot arrows at us,\u201d he said. The uncontacted Indians \u2013 known in the region as \u201cBravos\" or \"Braves\" \u2013 have come under pressure from illegal loggers over the border in Peru, according to members of the Ashaninka tribe. \u201cThe Bravos are coming at us because Peruvian loggers are heading straight for them,\u201d said Txate.\n\nThe Bravos have carried out raids on other villages, putting communities along the Envira River on permanent alert. The Indians have reaffirmed their decision not to fight the uncontacted tribes, but they are demanding that the Brazilian government take steps to help protect their territory.\n\nAvoiding any peaceful contact with outsiders, the Bravos have their own huts in the jungle and use forest trails. A chief from the Madija tribe followed a path used by the uncontacted Indians and picked up several objects that they had left, including a small ceramic flute. He gave the instrument to his son Binai, who is pictured playing it in the image above.\n\nOne Ashaninka couple, Poshe and Biana (pictured above) said that their three-year-old daughter Sawatxo had been taken by the Bravos some years ago. She was kidnapped at night from their village Simpatia and since then they haven\u2019t had any news of her.\n\nAshaninka leader Txate is worried about the incursions by the uncontacted Indians, but he understands their plight. \u201cThe Bravos also no longer have anywhere to go,\u201d he said.\n\nAside from disputes over territory, life for indigenous communities in the region is difficult. The area doesn\u2019t have a permanent health clinic along the river, and a trip to find medical help can take up to 10 days, depending on the boat and the availability of gasoline. In the image above, Huni Kui Indians mourn the death of a newborn child who was born in a boat on the Envira River as her mother tried to reach a hospital.\n\n1 / 20 Slideshow A Madija Indian child walks from a hut that is a frequent target of raids by uncontacted Indians.
