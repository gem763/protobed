The president on Sunday afternoon suggested he decided not to hold G-7 at Doral because of Democrats and the news media.\n\nSo interesting that, when I announced Trump National Doral in Miami would be used for the hosting of the G-7, and then rescinded due to Do Nothing Democrat/Fake News Anger, very few in Media mentioned that NO PROFITS would be taken, or would be given FREE, if legally permissible! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2019\n\nOn Thursday, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters that Trump planned to host next year\u2019s G-7 summit at the Trump National Doral, dismissing concerns that the president would personally profit by holding a political event at the resort near Miami. The announcement brought bipartisan backlash from people who felt the move is inappropriate, corrupt and probably illegal.\n\nTrump is the sole beneficiary of a trust that now owns the Trump Organization family business, which means hosting the summit at the resort would have likely given Trump millions of dollars. Holding the event at the property would have violated at least one of the Constitution\u2019s emolument clauses.\n\nTwo days after Mulvaney\u2019s announcement, Trump changed his mind, and blamed the news media and Democrats in a string of tweets for criticizing the move too much.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to reverse the G-7 announcement comes amid wavering support from his own political party. The president currently faces a House impeachment inquiry led by Democrats.\n\nWhite House aides reportedly told Trump that his plans to discuss foreign policy at the summit would be overshadowed by the controversy of the location. Republicans also called the White House after Mulvaney\u2019s press conference Thursday to complain that the chief of staff\u2019s comments effectively admitting to holding military aid to Ukraine made it extremely difficult to defend the president, according to the Journal.\n\n\"To be clear, what you described is a quid pro quo\" -- Here's Mick Mulvaney casually admitting that Trump held up aid to Ukraine as leverage to get the Ukrainian government to investigate the 2016 election pic.twitter.com/ylz7BKEmKd \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 17, 2019\n\nAt his presser last week, Mulvaney said that military aid to Ukraine was delayed partly because Trump wanted the country\u2019s officials to look into a security company hired by the Democratic National Committee that found that Russia had hacked the DNC\u2019s server in 2016.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we held up the money,\u201d Mulvaney said in a description that effectively admitted a quid pro quo, telling reporters: \u201cWe do that all the time. \u2026 Get over it.\u201d The question of a quid pro quo is at the center of the House impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nOnly on FOX News Sunday: Mick Mulvaney reacts to the president's decision to scrap the G7 summit at his Doral resort: \"At the end of the day he (the President) still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.\" Exclusively on FOX News Sunday.
