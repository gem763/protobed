USA!\u2019 as they celebrated the wicked Al Qaeda leader\u2019s grisly demise in a Pakistan shoot-out.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter how you voted, what mattered was that the man who masterminded 9/11 had finally been made to pay for his despicable crimes.\n\nIt was a great day for America, and for the world.\n\nAmerica was united in triumph when the mastermind of 9/11 - Osama Bin Laden (top right) was killed under the Obama administration. But yesterday, when the founder and leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (top left) President Trump was greeted by booing when he attended a World Series game.\n\nYesterday was another of those days.\n\nIn fact, some argue it was an even greater day.\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi was the founder and leader of ISIS, a terrorist group that makes even Al Qaeda look like choirboys.\n\nFor five years, after declaring Islamic State as a worldwide caliphate, Baghdadi presided over one of the most brutal, evil periods of unconscionable terrorist activity in modern history.\n\nBoth administrations released photographs as the presidents and their military leaders watched the moment both terrorist leaders were killed in American strikes\n\nHis followers burned victims alive in cages or slowly drowned them. They threw gay people off rooftops, and beheaded others on videos they then broadcast online.\n\nThey executed 13 teenage boys in Iraq with machine guns because they were watching a football match on TV.\n\nThey shot, suicide-bombed and massacred any rival Shia Muslims they could find in a relentless frenzied attempt to ethnically cleanse them off the face of the planet.\n\nThey murdered anyone who tried to leave their caliphate, or those they deemed \u2018ineffective in battle\u2019.\n\nHis followers burned victims alive in cages - like Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh, above, - or slowly drowned them. They threw gay people off rooftops, and beheaded others on videos they then broadcast online.\n\nThey kidnapped thousands of women, especially Kurds or Yazidis, and either sold them as sex slaves or forced them to marry ISIS fighters and be their sex slaves. Many were tortured, or killed themselves to escape the torment.\n\nThey trafficked human organs they ripped from living captives and hostages, including children.\n\nThey used brainwashed kids as young as six to be front line shields.\n\nAs Baghdadi\u2019s terrible tentacles spread ever further around the world, fueled by constant ISIS propaganda on the internet, the scale and ferocity of attacks against civilians worsened.\n\nIn January 2015, ISIS terrorists armed with assault rifles stormed the Paris offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people.\n\nThis is the moment Charlie Hebdo terrorists shot dead an injured policeman during an attack on a satirical magazine - gunning him down at close range as he held his hands up\n\nA few months later, ISIS carried out coordinated attacks in the same city at a football stadium, cafes and the Bataclan concert hall \u2013 killing 130 people and wounding 350.\n\nIn 2016, ISIS claimed responsibility when a man in a large truck drove through a crowd in Nice, France on Bastille Day, murdering 84 and injuring 330.\n\nA year later, an ISIS-inspired suicide bomber attacked an Ariana Grande pop concert in Manchester, England, killing 22 predominantly young girls and wounding another 59.\n\nFrench fire brigade members aid an injured individual near the Bataclan concert hall following fatal shootings in Paris, France, November 13, 2015\n\nAll of this was conducted on Baghdadi\u2019s watch.\n\nHe was the boss, the driving force, the brains behind the barbarism.\n\nSo yesterday was a truly great day for America and the world.\n\nIt was the day this monster was no longer alive to continue his disgusting reign of unimaginable horror and depravity.\n\nIt should have been a day that once again unified all Americans, even in these hyper-partisan times.\n\nYet last night, I turned on the World Series baseball game in Washington D.C. to see the crowd loudly booing their president.\n\nIt was a staggering thing to observe: thousands of Americans gleefully jeering and mocking President Trump, the man who had just successfully ordered Baghdadi\u2019s death.\n\nThe shock I felt had nothing to do with a group of D.C. people booing Trump; America\u2019s capital city is the most intensely Trump-loathing place in the country (90% voted for Hillary in 2016) and for many of its extreme liberal inhabitants, booing him is a 24/7 obsession.\n\nShockingly, thousands of Americans gleefully jeered and mocked President Trump, the man who had just successfully ordered Baghdadi\u2019s death as he attended the World series game in Washington yesterday (seen arriving above)\n\nNo, the shock I felt was to do with the timing of this booing.\n\nFrankly, whatever you think of Trump, it beggars belief to me that any American would choose yesterday to abuse their president.\n\nThere are many legitimate reasons to dislike him.\n\nHe\u2019s comfortably the most divisive and polarizing president in modern United States history, a man whose inflammatory rhetoric has done much, though by no means all, to fuel the toxicity of current American political discourse.\n\nAnd his possibly impeachable conduct over the Ukraine \u2018quid pro quo\u2019 scandal, and his outrageous decision to throw U.S. allies the Kurds under the bus in Syria, have all made him even more unpopular at the moment.\n\nEven the way he announced the news of Baghdadi\u2019s death was typically Trumpian, and to many of his critics, \u2018unpresidential\u2019.\n\nFrom his gloating bombast and security-threatening over-sharing about the raid, to his false claim that only he had previously warned of the dangers posed of bin Laden, and his shockingly inappropriate book plug, it was a needlessly self-aggrandising performance when all Trump had to say was: \u2018I ordered a successful mission to kill the world\u2019s most dangerous terrorist\u2019.\n\nThat stunning fact alone is something that can win elections.\n\nHe didn\u2019t need all the extra off-script blather, though personally, I liked hearing the gory details of Baghdadi\u2019s final moments.\n\nNothing begets a man more than the manner of his death, and now the whole world knows Baghdadi was a sniveling little coward who dragged three of his own poor children to their deaths in a desperate attempt to save himself.\n\nSo President Trump never helps himself, and there are many perfectly legitimate criticisms to be leveled at him.\n\nBUT, and I think it\u2019s a big \u2018BUT\u2019, last night was not the time to do it.\n\nLast night was a time for America to put aside its insanely vicious partisan feuding and just celebrate the demise of the worst person on Planet Earth.\n\nThat\u2019s not, as some of his enemies would have you believe, Donald Trump.\n\nIt was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nHis death is a massive boost for American in its war on terror.\n\nIt cuts the head off ISIS at the precise moment its entire existence is teetering on the brink of collapse.\n\nIt\u2019s no exaggeration to say this might hasten the end of ISIS altogether, though we can certainly expect some form of reprisal attacks in the wake of Baghdadi\u2019s death as the few remaining ISIS fighters desperately try to rally support.\n\nSo regardless of your view of Trump, and I\u2019ve been as critical of him in recent weeks as anyone, this was a moment to praise him for taking the bold, courageous decision to order a dangerous mission that successfully took out the leader of ISIS.\n\nOf course, most of the praise should go to the heroic special forces operatives that carried out the mission, and the much-maligned \u2013 not least by Trump - U.S. intelligence agencies who helped track Baghdadi down.\n\nBut Trump himself still deserves great credit for ordering the operation. If it had failed, Baghdadi had escaped and US forces had been killed, it would have been a disaster for America and for him.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say, as Trump predictably did, that it was a bigger moment than bin Laden\u2019s death, given how uniquely emotive and vengeful Americans understandably felt after 9/11, but it was certainly as significant.\n\nSo for Americans to use this moment to boo their president, and chant \u2018Lock him up!\u2019 seems crass, wrong and unpatriotic.\n\nYes, I know Trump\u2019s encourages his own supporters to do this to Hillary Clinton at all his base rallies.\n\nBut just because he\u2019s wrong to do that, which he is, it doesn\u2019t make it right to do it to him on such an important day.\n\nIn fact, it makes it unpatriotic and shameful.\n\nWhen bin Laden was killed, the images of Americans coming together in joy went round the world and were a powerful symbol of unity.\n\nToday, the only images people will see are of Americans booing their president for helping to kill the leader of ISIS.\n\nYes, it was a bad look for Trump.\n\nBut it\u2019s a far worse look for America.", "description": "Yesterday was a truly great day for America and the world as the head of ISIS was killed.
