During the interview, Chip, 44, spoke about his love for Joanna, 41, and how he wants another child with his wife\n\nFull plate: Chip's admittance comes after the family already welcomed their fifth child, a son named Crew (pictured), last year\n\nChip, 44, was filmed nodding along before he burst out saying how much he loved his wife.\n\n'I love you,' he said. 'When you were just saying all those things my heart just burst open\u2026 like I could see Crew having a little sibling and me being like, \"I love this woman!\"'\n\nDespite the loving confession, Joanna was not as willing to push for more children as her husband.\n\nShe joked with Willie about how 'unprompted' Chip was with the admittance of wanting more children since the comment had nothing to do what Willie and Joanna were discussing.\n\n'When I'm 50, Chip's going to want more kids. Just know, this is going to be like the headline forever\u2014 \"Jo's pregnant again,\"' she said to the host.\n\nJoanna continued: 'Chip with children is like [business]\u2014 there's never too many. I'm like, \"Chip I think we've got enough business, I think we're good!\" That's how Chip is with children. He's like, \"I just think we can keep having them.\" I think Chip just loves a full plate.'\n\nBusy: Joanna seemed unconvinced to add another child to the family after already having five children at home (pictured are her four oldest kids)\n\nAlways working: The couple does have a relatively full plate as they are preparing to launch their own television network called Magnolia Network in 2020\n\nStating the plate is already full for the family is not entirely wrong, given the couple already has five children together.\n\nTheir eldest child, Drake, is 14 years old while their youngest child, Crew, just turned one in recent months \u2014 making for a full household.\n\nAnd although Chip and Joanna ended their Fixer Upper show in 2018, they did not slow down on the business front.\n\nMagnolia Network will be the couple's new television network, which is set to launch in 2020. They also have created multiple businesses that include a bakery, a restaurant, and hotel.\n\nSo if a six child fits into that family plan remains to be seen, especially with Joanna appearing more skeptical about adding another child to the mix.\n\nThe full interview with Chip and Joanna will air on Sunday Today this Sunday, October 27.", "description": "Chip and Joanna Gaines spoke to Willie Geist for Sunday Today.
