We\u2019re in the fortunate space of having a full squad to pick from.\u201d\n\nStar No 8 Duane Vermeulen was also cleared after he was on the receiving end of a shocking 'double' tip tackle which saw Italian loosehead Andrea Lovotti red carded early in the second half.\n\nKolbe scored two tries in the win over Italy - on the way to being awarded the man of the match prize - to take his Test tally to seven in 12 Tests since making his debut 13 months ago.\n\nFellow wing Makazole Mapimpi scored his 11th in as many Tests - and collected nine stitches in a forehead gash - while there were others for hooker Bongi Mbonambi, centre Lukhanyo Am, replacement hooker Malcolm Marx and a career first for lock RG Snyman.\n\nThe win moved the Springboks to the top of Pool B on points difference from Italy, although New Zealand have a game in hand.\n\nThe Springboks will name their team to meet Canada on Sunday.", "description": "The Springboks reported no major injury concerns following their Pool B victory over Italy at the Shizuoka Stadium ECOPA.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7745/d2b16defd5794f599b23ff93b88f941b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
