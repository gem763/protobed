Although a deal had been largely agreed, an additional facility requested in the last few days of negotiations presented a challenge that ultimately proved insurmountable.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of profound regret to me and the rest of the board that we were not successful. I would like to apologise to our millions of customers, and thousands of employees, suppliers and partners who have supported us for many years. Despite huge uncertainty over recent weeks, our teams continued to put customers first, showing why Thomas Cook is one of the best-loved brands in travel.\n\n\u201cGenerations of customers entrusted their family holiday to Thomas Cook because our people kept our customers at the heart of the business and maintained our founder\u2019s spirit of innovation.\n\n\u201cThis marks a deeply sad day for the company which pioneered package holidays and made travel possible for millions of people around the world.\u201d", "description": "Peter Fankhauser, the chief executive of Thomas Cook, apologized on Monday for the liquidation of the world's oldest travel company.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
