However, in a statement issued on Tuesday they would not elaborate as to whether they would try to do the same this weekend.\n\n\"Public and team safety is our number one priority. While we have robust contingency plans in place for pool matches, such plans, if required, will only be actioned if the safety of teams, fans, and workforce can be guaranteed. It would be inappropriate to comment on any contingency plans at this stage,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We will continue to closely monitor this developing situation in partnership with our weather information experts, local authorities, transport providers and the teams, and will provide a further update tomorrow.\"\n\nShould weather problems continue later into the tournament, the rules allow several days for knockout games to be rescheduled.
