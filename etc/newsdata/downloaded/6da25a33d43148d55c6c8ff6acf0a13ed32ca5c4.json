Add Interest\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Irish leader Leo Varadkar provided a status update on the issue after a private lunch meeting in northwest England.\n\n\"Both continue to believe that a deal is in everybody's interest,\" they said in a joint statement. \"They agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal.\"\n\nBritain is due to leave the 28-nation bloc on Oct. 31, and attempts to find a deal have foundered over plans for the border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.'s Northern Ireland.\n\nThe currently all-but-invisible border underpins both the regional economy and Northern Ireland's peace process.\n\nThere was little of substance in Varadkar and Johnson's statement indicating a breakthrough or whether the \"pathway\" was near or far off.\n\nThe two agreed to \"reflect\" further on their discussions, which concentrated on the challenges of customs and consent. They also agreed to keep talking.\n\nUnder a U.K. proposal, there would have to be customs checks on some goods, though not on the border itself. The EU says any customs checks are unacceptable.\n\nIn recent days, Britain and the EU have traded bad-tempered barbs about who is responsible for the deadlock in talks.\n\nAfter Johnson's Downing Street office claimed EU intransigence had made it \"essentially impossible\" for the U.K. to leave with a deal, European Commission President Donald Tusk warned against playing a \"stupid blame game.\"\n\nVaradkar and other EU leaders say Johnson, who took office in July, has repudiated the withdrawal agreement made with the bloc by his predecessor, Theresa May. That deal was rejected three times by Britain's Parliament, largely because of lawmakers' opposition to provisions to ensure an open Irish border.\n\nJohnson insists the U.K. will leave the U.K. on Oct. 31, with or without a divorce deal.\n\nHowever, many members of Britain's Parliament are determined to prevent a no-deal Brexit, which economists say would plunge the U.K. economy into recession. Last month, they passed a law requiring the government to ask the EU for a delay if no divorce deal has been agreed by Oct. 19 \u2014 the day after a key summit of EU leaders in Brussels.\n\nJohnson says he won't delay Brexit past Oct. 31 \u2014 but also will obey the law. It's unclear how the two statements can be reconciled.\n\nParliament is expected to hold a rare Saturday sitting on Oct. 19 as lawmakers grapple with what to do next.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDanica Kirka in London contributed.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP's full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
