Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSaagar Enjeti questions Warren's authenticity on 'Medicare for all' All-female panel to moderate November Democratic primary debate Ocasio-Cortez grills Zuckerberg over political ad policy MORE (D-Mass.) and Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenSenate GOP blocks three election security bills for second day House passes bill taking aim at anonymous shell companies Senate Democrats to force vote Wednesday to overturn IRS rules on SALT deduction cap MORE (D-Ore.) urged the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Thursday to investigate whether Amazon\u2019s failure to secure its servers, which resulted in a breach that exposed the personal data of 100 million Americans, was a violation of federal law.\n\nWarren and Wyden wrote in a letter to FTC Chairman Joseph Simons on Thursday that Amazon \u201cknew, or should have known\u201d that their Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud server, which the company rented to Capital One to store data, was vulnerable to cyberattacks.\n\nThe massive data breach was revealed in July when Capital One announced that an individual was able to gain access to the data of both credit card customers and those who had applied for credit cards. The data of six million Canadians was also included in the breach, with some social security and credit card numbers among the compromised data.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFormer Amazon employee Paige Thompson was subsequently arrested and indicted by a federal grand jury in August for allegedly breaching servers containing customer data from Capital One and approximately 30 other companies.\n\nThompson was arrested after she posted about her theft of the data on GitHub and another user reported her to Capital One, which then alerted the FBI.\n\nWyden, who serves as the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, and Warren, who serves on the Senate Banking Committee, made the case that Amazon may have broken the law through its failure to secure its servers against server side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, the method allegedly used by Thompson to gain access to the data.\n\n\u201cAlthough Amazon\u2019s competitors addressed the threat of SSRF attacks several years ago, Amazon continues to sell defective cloud computing services to businesses, government agencies, and to the general public,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cAs such, Amazon shares some responsibility for the theft of data on 100 million customers.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the senators asked the FTC to investigate whether Amazon\u2019s failure to secure its services constitutes an \u201cunfair and deceptive business practice,\u201d which would violate Section 5 of the FTC Act.\n\nThe senators cited a 2018 email that Amazon received from a cybersecurity expert who raised concerns around potential SSRF attacks on Amazon\u2019s servers and recommended that the company adopt security practices already used by Google and Microsoft to further secure sensitive data. An Amazon official responded to the expert that their feedback would be considered.\n\nA spokesperson for the FTC told The Hill that it had received the letter from the senators, but had no additional comment on a potential investigation.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nWyden sent a letter to Amazon in early August following the announcement of the breach asking questions around the incident, to which AWS CISO Stephen Schmidt responded that Amazon \u201cinvests a substantial amount of resources securing our services and helping our customers secure themselves, and will continue to do so forever.\u201d\n\nWarren, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, has made breaking up big tech a key part of her campaign platform, zeroing in on Amazon as part of this.", "description": "Amazon\u2019s failure to secure its servers resulted in a breach that exposed the personal data of 100 million Americans.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/amazon_ecommerce_01072019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
