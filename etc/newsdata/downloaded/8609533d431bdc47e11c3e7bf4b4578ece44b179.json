Price spike - and as a result, Oil prices spiked as much as 20% on Monday morning, ostensibly due to the huge impact on oil production\n\n- and as a result, Oil prices spiked as much as 20% on Monday morning, ostensibly due to the huge impact on oil production Interest Rates - big calls were made by SARB, US Fed & the BOE this last week on interest rates\n\n- big calls were made by SARB, US Fed & the BOE this last week on interest rates SAA bailout - yet another 'capital injection' is coming for in September...what next for the SOEs?\n\n- yet another 'capital injection' is coming for in September...what next for the SOEs? Zim's collapse - things are going from bad to worse for SA's neighbours, as interest rates soar and famine fears worsen\n\nTo start things off, the market 'gapped' over the weekend and the Rand started 7c weaker to the Dollar at 14.62...\n\nThe first news of the week was the Saudi Arabia oil crisis which had developed over the weekend, with Iran suspected and accused of having sent drones in to strike the Saudi oil fields. The missiles fired from these drones caused significant damage and fires raged as a result of the attacks. Oil prices skyrocketed 20% on Monday morning, as the world tried to digest 5% of its global production being affected in one attack.\n\n(Of interest, Elliott Wave analysis showed the market was primed for a substantial spike up days prior - all it needed was a trigger....and what a trigger it got!)\n\nThis did not do any good for US & Iran relations, as the Trump administration came out and called it an \"Act of War\"..and an Iranian official warned of \"all-out war\" should the US or Saudi Arabia attack.\n\nThis left markets on tenterhooks and US Stocks went for a tumble on the uncertainty of it all.\n\nThankfully, as the week went on, Oil prices stabilized once again down into the mid $60s with Saudi Arabia returning to normal oil production, after the market had touched $70 to the barrel...funny how Elliott Wave can almost foretell the news.\n\nHowever, risk-off sentiment as investors like to call it, was back in town, and the Rand continued to lose ground as the week went on:\n\nUSD/ZAR Chart\n\nIn fact, by Friday evening, the market had lost all of 40c from the previous week's close, touching R14.98 to the Dollar, which perfectly validated our forecast from Friday the 13th's forecast, with the market firstly bottoming out slap-bang in the R14.66-14.40 area, and then moving up to make a high slap-ban in the middle of the R14.87-15.07 target area.\n\nAnother win for Elliott Wave analysis!\n\nIn response to our forecasts this last week, here are some comments from our clients:\n\nPaul Sneeden: \"Thank you for your reply to my mail, answering my questions. You guys are one in a billion. Your forecasts complete my trading system, which is now eventually going smoothly. Your forecasts are incredibly accurate. I wait in anticipation every Wednesday & Friday. My system would simply not work without your forecasts.\"\n\n\"Thank you for your reply to my mail, answering my questions. You guys are one in a billion. Your forecasts complete my trading system, which is now eventually going smoothly. Your forecasts are incredibly accurate. I wait in anticipation every Wednesday & Friday. My system would simply not work without your forecasts.\" Samson Orimolade: \"By the way, I also testify that the Rand predictions have been insanely accurate. Since joining the trial, i have seen significant improvement.\"\n\nIt is truly amazing to see the power of the Elliott Wave Principle!\n\nWhile far from perfect, its reliability is something we have not found to be challenged by any other system...\n\n... in forecasting any liquid financial market.\n\nAnd that is why we launched our Global Market Forecast service during this past week to our existing Dynamic Outcomes community with a special clients-only launch, covering 4 global markets under a new website and branding:\n\nDXY ( )\n\n(Euro vs US Dollar)\n\n(Gold vs US Dollar)\n\n(Bitcoin vs US Dollar)\n\nHow did it go?\n\nAll I can say is, very well! We have had some wonderful take-up, feedback and support.\n\nIn other news, there were some other big headlines:\n\nInterest rates were the order of the week with SARB, US Fed and the BOE needing to make a call on their nation's interest rates. The Fed went ahead first on Wednesday, and as expected there was a rate cut - but of only 0.25% which was not nearly enough to satisfy President Trump who said \"Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No \u201cguts,\u201d no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!\". It was then the turn of the BOE, and they returned to their same old strategy of \"wait and see\" due to the Brexit uncertainty, leaving rates at 0.75%. Lastly it was the turn of SARB - who also unanimously decided to keep interest rates on hold for now.\n\nLocally, it was a week of bailouts and loans for government departments, as it was confirmed that SAA would be getting another R5.5bn of capital injection by the end of September. The black hole for getting rid of cash does not seem to ever reach its limit! And then it was the turn of SANRAL, as they got a R7bn loan from BRICS bank in China this last week to improve toll roads. Somewhere along the line, this money is going to have to be repaid...and Communist China gets a firmer grip on Africa...\n\nOver the border in Zimbabwe was another story, as the SA neighbours are now really suffering, with interest rates having been hiked to 70% to compensate for the dire economy, and the risks of a worst-ever famine a harsh reality for locals, as the economy collapsed. According to the United Nations World Food Programme: The worst drought in almost four decades, cyclone-induced floods and an economic collapse have left Zimbabwe on the verge of its worst-ever famine. The southern African nation will probably run out of maize - its staple food - by January and about three out of five Zimbabweans won\u2019t have enough to eat.\n\n\n\nA shocking and scary state of affairs, as African leaders continue to spend time on doing something such as honouring the murderous dictator Mugabe, rather than look after their own citizen's basic food to survive!\n\nAnd that was that for the week...although only a fraction of all that happened, such as Fed's comments on repurchase operations flashing warning signs as to the economy!\n\nAs for the Rand, it closed out the week around R14.90 to the Dollar as per our forecast, with a lot of USD pressure taking its toll.\n\nThe Week Ahead (23-27 Sept 2019)\n\nWell, as we head into the new week, where next for the Rand?\n\nAs far as triggers go, there are a few medium size trigger events, such as:\n\nSA PPI\n\nUS Goods Trade Balance\n\nUS Durable Goods Orders\n\nBut probably more focus will be on global events such as Iran-Saudi Arabia-US relations and Brexit.\n\nBut all in all, we expect another volatile week in the markets.\n\nSo, how do you manage your exposures?\n\nAs you can see from last week, once again, we simply let the market itself provide us with the best guess of what was likely to happen - and it followed through perfectly.\n\nThrough applying the Elliott Wave Principle (the study of human behaviour in financial markets) together with our unique combination of price ratio, momentum and time cycle studies give you something you can use:\n\nto make objective, informed and actionable decisions\n\ninstead of emotionally-charged knew-jerk ones (our default).\n\nBased on our analysis, the next few weeks are likely to take many many persons by surprise - please do no be one of them.\n\nLook forward to sharing my outlook with you.\n\nTo your success~\n\nJames Paynter\n\nOriginal post", "description": "Forex Analysis by Dynamic Outcomes Rand Forecasting Service (James Paynter) covering: EUR/USD, USD/ZAR, XAU/USD, US Dollar Index Futures.
