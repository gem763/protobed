Not without nuclear weapons, at least.\n\nTo sum up: Trump and fellow Turkish \u201cnationalist\u201d president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan chatted two Sundays ago, and Trump subsequently announced he was pulling U.S. troops from territory in Northern Syria that we\u2019d helped the Kurds occupy. The reason was that Erdo\u011fan planned a massive incursion to wipe out those Kurds, all of whom he considers to be Marxist-Leninist terrorists, and whose destruction would be a feather in his populist cap. The Turkish operation began. U.S. forces, caught unawares by the move, began a hasty and logistically problematic retreat; at one point American troops found themselves deliberately \u201cbracketed\u201d by Turkish artillery fire\u2014pinned in position and wholly reactive to the movements of a foreign state\u2019s force, one set in motion by their own commander in chief. This may have been the first time any nation that houses U.S. nuclear weapons\u2014there are an estimated 50 thermonuclear air-drop warheads at Incirlik Air Force Base in Turkey\u2014targeted U.S. troops with its own army. (\u201cSeriously, it\u2019s time to take our fucking nuclear weapons out of Turkey,\u201d one longtime arms-control expert tweeted in response to the targeting news.)\n\nSince then, U.S. forces on the ground are in anguish and \u201cashamed,\u201d witnessing atrocities and abandoning allies to potential Turkish war crimes. The Kurds, having seen Trump almost pull this last year, had asked their American partners\u2019 help in planning for a post-U.S. scenario by aligning with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and his Russian backers. The U.S. had said no, assuring the Kurds it would not abandon them. After all, Trump had publicly bragged last summer that he\u2019d singlehandedly stopped Erdogan from going in before; \u201cI called him and asked him not to do it, and he hasn\u2019t done it,\u201d he said in June. But Erdogan did it. And he told Trump that he was doing it.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, with steel raining down on them, without the protection of American promises or partners, the Kurds have made that deal with Damascus, and Assad\u2014a patrilineal dictator in the small pantheon of sociopaths who have used chemical weapons on his own people\u2014holds more territory in the north than he\u2019s had since almost the beginning of the civil war that fragmented Syria. Because the U.S. had no hand in the deal, he can do things his way. Journalists and NGO workers, fearing arrest or torture or death at Syrian hands, are fleeing the Kurdish north, leaving no witnesses for whatever is about to follow.", "description": "Since Nixon, presidential pundits and sycophants have tried to rationalize executive insanity.
