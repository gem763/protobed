And it\u2019s in 4K at 60 fps, no less.\n\nWhile the game is already a hit on PS4 and Xbox One, the Windows release is a big deal, not just because it\u2019ll bring in a huge new wave of players, but also because this version will look better than it ever has. The PC version is getting HDR support, unlocked resolution of 4K and above, support for ultrawide aspect ratios and multi-monitor setups, and unlocked frame rates. PC Gamer noted that trees, shadows, and other visual elements are being improved as well.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 lands in the Rockstar Game Launcher and Epic Games Store on November 5; if you want to buy it on Steam, you\u2019ll need to wait until December.
