(Photo: USDA)\n\nGeorgia food producer Tip Top Poultry is recalling an undetermined amount of ready-to-eat chicken products including sandwiches, salads, wraps and other dishes for possible contamination with listeria.\n\nThe frozen, diced and shredded chicken products were made between Jan. 21, 2019, and Sept. 24, 2019, at the company's Rockmart, Georgia, cooking facility, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service.\n\nAn undetermined amount of the products were sold across the U.S. and in Canada at retailers including Aldi, Trader Joe's, Food Lion, Harris Teeter, Kroger, Giant, Dillons, IGA, Food 4 Less, Piggly Wiggly and Redners Warehouse Market.\n\nThis is an expansion of Tip Top Poultry's recall from Sept. 28, issued after several products sold in Canada tested positive for listeria monocytogenes. All of the products involved were made on a single production line at the plant, which had been given a \"thorough intensified cleaning plan,\" the company said, after an earlier sample had been found to have listeria in it.\n\nSocial Security: Cost-of-living increase to raise benefits 1.6% in 2020\n\nClimate change: These disasters that could get worse if we don't do anything about global warming\n\n\"Tip Top Poultry is shutting down this fowl cooking line until it identifies the source of any potential contamination and completely eliminates it,\" the company in a statement about the recall on its website.\n\nThe recall was expanded this week because the products, such as chicken salad, were used in other products, the USDA says. Some of the products may have been served from the deli counter in grocery stores, the agency says.\n\nThis Market Sandwich chicken salad sandwich is among many recalled over concerns of potential listeria contamination of ready-to-eat chicken produced by Tip Top Poultry of Rockmart, Ga. (Photo: USDA)\n\nThe products being recalled carry the number \u201cEst. P-17453\u201d inside the USDA inspection mark. Among the products are Duke Chicken Salad, Clean Eatz Baja Pineapple Chicken, SpringGlen Fresh Foods Chunky White Meat Chicken Salad, Nutrisystem Three Cheese Chicken, Private Selection Butter chicken Spring Rolls, and Trader Joe's Chicken Pot Pie.

Most susceptible are pregnant women and their newborns, adults ages 65 or older, and people with weakened immune systems, the agency says.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/10/chicken-recall-listeria-risk-ready-eat-products-sold-across-us/3928178002/", "description": "Shipments of ready-to-eat chicken sandwiches and salads sold in stores such as Aldi, Dillons and Trader Joe's are being recalled for listeria risks.", "authors": ["Mike Snider", "Published A.M.
