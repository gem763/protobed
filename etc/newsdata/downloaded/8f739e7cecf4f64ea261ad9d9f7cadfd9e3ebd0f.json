They were charged with undermining national security by supplying information to a foreign state, an act punishable by up to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nJudge Im Vannak of the Phnom Penh Municipal Court said the investigation had been insufficient.\n\nCambodia Daily shuts with 'dictatorship' parting shot at prime minister Hun Sen Read more\n\nHe said electronic equipment confiscated from the defendants would have to be examined again, with the case returned to a new investigating judge.\n\nThe men remain free on bail but were disappointed by the ruling. It was the second time in just over a month that they had appeared in court expecting to hear a verdict.\n\nYeang Sothearin told reporters the court was prolonging their suffering.\n\n\u201cWhen I came today, I was strongly expecting that I would get justice from the court or get a clear decision by the court, but that did not happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not afraid of the court conducting a new investigation into our cases, but by doing so it will affect our freedom.\u201d\n\nThe ruling comes at a sensitive time for the government as it seeks to ward off the threat of major economic sanctions from the European Union, which is currently considering withdrawing preferential trade tariffs from Cambodia because of its suppression of democratic rights. The United States has applied limited sanctions and is under pressure to do more.\n\nThe 2017 crackdown, which included a court-ordered dissolution of the country\u2019s only viable opposition party, was generally seen as an effort to ensure victory for Hun Sen\u2019s ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party in the 2018 general election.\n\nThe party swept all the seats in the National Assembly but drew serious criticism from foreign countries.\n\n\u201cI think we are hostages in the current situation, and I know that we would not be arrested if we had not worked for Radio Free Asia,\u201d said co-defendant Uon Chhin.\n\nHun Sen, who has been in power for four decades and announced his intention to serve two more terms, has nonetheless kept the pressure on his political opponents, some of whom are calling for regime change by mass peaceful action.\n\nMembers of the opposition are often hounded in the courts, which are considered by critics to be under the government\u2019s influence.\n\n\u201cThe legal harassment of former RFA reporters Yaeng Sothearin and Uon Chhin has gone on way too long and should stop immediately. A new investigation into what were already spurious charges is unacceptable and will continue to cast a shadow over Cambodia\u2019s darkening press freedom situation,\u201d said Shawn Crispin, Southeast Asia representative of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\nPolice initially said the two defendants had been detained for running an unlicensed karaoke studio. But they were later accused of setting up a studio for Radio Free Asia, which they deny, and were charged with espionage.", "description": "Radio Free Asia\u2019s Uon Chhin and Yeang Sothearin were arrested in 2017 crackdown on Prime Minister Hun Sen\u2019s opponents", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83f6c9f3161f20c349d82c83c1d0385399a3a7f2/0_224_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c7a34d46e33897e08e72b907c17c172d"}
