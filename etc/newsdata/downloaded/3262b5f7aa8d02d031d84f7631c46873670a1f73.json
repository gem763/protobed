The two pictures now show Kate and William, left, and Prince William and Harry in their military uniforms, right\n\nThe source yesterday suggested the House of Windsor was not able to harness the power of the couple, who they said, had single-handedly modernised the monarchy.\n\nPhotographs show a small table with a red and white lamp and a small clock with two framed pictures, one showing Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, the other showing Prince William together with Prince Harry in their military uniforms.\n\nThe picture of Meghan and Harry went on display days after their May 2018 nuptials, showing Harry wearing a blue suit facing Meghan wearing in a figure-hugging dress.\n\nIt was there on July 24, when the Queen met Boris Johnson to appoint him Prime Minister.

And especially as a woman it's really, it's really a lot.'\n\nMeghan also admitted 'not many people' had checked how she was truly coping - a confession some commentators have seen as a swipe at the Royal Family.\n\nShe said: 'Well, I guess, and also thank you for asking, but not many people have asked if I'm okay, but it's a very real thing to be faint behind the scenes.'\n\nPrince Harry voiced his fears of 'a repeat of the past' and protecting his family from the media, and Harry also told the programme about his relationship with his brother, saying they have 'good days' and 'bad days' and are travelling on 'different paths'.\n\nA source close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex (pictured) has hit out at the palace and said the institution around the royal family is full of people 'inexperienced' at how best to 'deploy and harness their value'\n\nIt triggered a response from William as an insider told the BBC that he was worried Harry and Meghan were in a 'fragile place.'\n\nAccording to the source who spoke to CNN they said that Harry was just giving an 'honest answer' and that any sibling seeing that 'would of course be concerned.'\n\nRoyal commentators also expressed their discontent with the actions of Harry and Meghan, and said the Queen and senior royals are 'very worried' about the direction the 'divisive' couple are heading.\n\nJonny Dymond, the BBC's royal correspondent, said: 'I think they (the royal family) will be pretty horrified actually.'
