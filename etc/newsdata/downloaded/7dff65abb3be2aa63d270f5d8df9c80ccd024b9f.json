They were part of a group of four British ISIS soldiers who beheaded seven Western journalists and aid workers\n\n'This could lead to their escape or to behaviors that may get out of the control of the security forces,' added Jia Kurd, adviser to the Kurdish-led authority in the SDF region.\n\n'The number of forces guarding the prisons is reduced the more the battles intensify. This poses a grave danger.'\n\nThe Center for American Progress warned that Trump's withdrawal of support for the Kurds had 'sowed the seeds of an ISIS resurgence.'\n\nKelly Magsamen, vice president for National Security and International Policy at the Center for American Progress, said: 'Turkey is now launching airstrikes and artillery aimed at crushing Kurdish and Arab fighters, who have long been friends of the United States.\n\n'President Trump has not only callously abandoned our Kurdish and Arab allies who have fought ISIS alongside U.S. troops, but he has also sowed the seeds of an ISIS resurgence.\n\n'Since Turkey has no plan to hold the thousands of captured ISIS fighters that have until now been in the custody of mostly Kurdish forces, we now face the very real prospect of 10,000 ISIS prisoners rejoining the battlefield, further destabilizing the region and our national security.'\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan sought to assuage concerns from world powers on Thursday that his operation runs the risk of an Islamic State jail break amid the chaos.\n\nHe said he guaranteed jihadists will not have a presence in northeast Syria after Turkey completes its offensive.\n\nA diplomat following Syria said the SDF was unlikely to release prisoners on purpose.\n\nTurkey began shelling and bombing the Kurdish-held town of Qamishli on Wednesday (pictured) ahead of an invasion after Donald Trump handed over control of the region\n\n'We can't rule out unrest in the IDP (Internally displaced persons) camps to make life more difficult for the SDF, or ISIS fighters trying to bust people out...We are watching it closely, we don't think they will open the gates. That is not their style and would be self defeating,' the diplomat said.\n\n'The SDF know how important this issue is to the international community - and some of the reports coming out are trying to create an international feeling of crisis around the issue of the ISIS detainees and their families.'\n\nHuman Rights Watch said this week the SDF has held thousands of men and boys in severely overcrowded schools and other buildings on charges of having joined Islamic State.\n\nIt said the Turkish incursion highlights the urgent need for countries to repatriate their citizens.\n\n'No one is accepting responsibility for them,' the U.S.-based rights group said, calling for urgently improving prison conditions and ensuring lawful detention.\n\nThe SDF has halted operations against Islamic State because of the Turkish offensive, two U.S. officials and a Kurdish source said.", "description": "Kurdish authorities claimed last night's bombardments at the border town of\u00a0Qamishli had struck a prison full of its 'most dangerous' ISIS inmates in a 'clear attempt' to liberate them.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/17/19550342-0-image-a-14_1570726252240.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
