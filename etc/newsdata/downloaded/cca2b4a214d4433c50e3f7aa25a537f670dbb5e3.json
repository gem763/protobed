I\u2019m Karen Weise, the tech correspondent here. Let\u2019s start with our local giant, Amazon:\n\nAmazon may have taken some hits in the Democratic debate on Tuesday, but in its hometown, it has come out swinging. Seattle is fast approaching one of the most contentious local elections in recent memory, and Amazon this week dropped an additional $1 million into the fray.\n\nAmazon\u2019s new contributions, made to the political action committee run by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, bring its total to more than $1.4 million this year, a staggering sum for a city election, let alone from a company that was M.I.A. in local politics for years. Four years ago, Amazon gave just $25,000 to the PAC.\n\nSeven of the nine seats on the City Council are up for grabs in November, presenting an opportunity to virtually remake the booming city\u2019s leadership at a pivotal time for addressing the stresses of growth, affordability and homelessness.
