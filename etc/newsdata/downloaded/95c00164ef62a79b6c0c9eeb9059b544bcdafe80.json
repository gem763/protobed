The Iranian ship was released in August.\n\n\u201cIt reached international waters,\u201d Stena Bulk Chief Executive Erik Hanell told Reuters in a text message after the Stena Impero began sailing, adding that the ship\u2019s master \u201creported that all crew members are safe and in high spirits following release.\u201d\n\nHe said the crew would receive medical checks and be de-briefing in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, on the opposite side of the Gulf, before travelling home to their families. Seven of the 23 crew were freed earlier this month.\n\nThe seizure of the ship ratcheted up tension after attacks in May and June on other merchant vessels in Gulf waters, which the United States blamed on Iran, a charge Tehran denied.\n\nThe Ports and Maritime Organisation of Iran in the country\u2019s southern Hormozgan Province said the ship started to move out from Bandar Abbas at 9 a.m. Iran time (0530 GMT).\n\nBut it said the judicial file on the vessel remained open and the process of looking into \u201cviolations\u201d by the ship was ongoing.\n\nStena Impero, a British-flagged vessel owned by Stena Bulk, is seen at undisclosed place off the coast of Bandar Abbas, Iran August 22, 2019.
