So when a passenger asks how to find their row, for example, she\u2019s surprised.\n\nWhen she encounters passengers flying for the first time, she has to remind herself that they don\u2019t know as much about flying as she does, she said.\n\nHow easy it is to bond with other flight attendants\n\nsource Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images\n\n\u201cMost of the people who I work with, I just hit it off with right away. We\u2019re just so similar,\u201d a flight attendant for United Airlines said. \u201cI feel like flight attendants, in general, have very similar personalities.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou meet someone and you feel like you\u2019ve known them for 10 years,\u201d she added.\n\nHow inconsiderate some passengers can be\n\nsource Shutterstock\n\nA flight attendant for Delta Air Lines said he\u2019s surprised by how inconsiderate some passengers can be toward flight attendants and other passengers.\n\n\u201cSome people just act like children,\u201d he said.\n\nOne time, a passenger required medical attention after a flight he was working landed. In that kind of situation, the immediate priority is to make sure the passenger who needs medical attention is able to leave the plane, but some passengers were worried about missing their connection and had to be told to stay in their seats as the passenger who needed medical attention was escorted off the flight, the Delta flight attendant said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just shocking to see that side of people,\u201d he said.\n\nHow enjoyable the job is\n\nsource Robert Alexander/Getty Images\n\nKevin Cain, a flight attendant for PSA Airlines, said he\u2019s been surprised by how much he\u2019s enjoyed being a flight attendant.\n\n\u201cI knew what to expect, but I didn\u2019t think I would find a career, per se, in being a flight attendant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of addicting being in-flight and getting positive feedback from passengers and knowing that you are providing a service [to them].\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Apply here to attend IGNITION: Transportation, an event focused on the future of transportation, in San Francisco on October 22.\n\nCelebrities can be very different in person than you\u2019d expect\n\nsource Mehmet Ali Ozcan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nA flight attendant who works for Worldwide Jet, which charters private jets, said she often works flights with celebrity passengers. By watching celebrities on television or reading about them in tabloids, you think you know them better than you do, she said.\n\nSometimes, their personalities are different than she expects, like Prince, who wanted the plane\u2019s internal temperature to be very hot and didn\u2019t want anyone on the flight to eat meat.\n\n\u201cYou think you know how the celebrities live, but you don\u2019t really know until you actually work with them,\u201d she said.\n\nUnruly passengers are rare\n\nsource Orhan Akkanat/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe most surprising part of my job is that I haven\u2019t actually had that many angry passengers,\u201d a flight attendant for Envoy Air said. \u201cThere\u2019s always something in the media about the airline industry and how passengers are getting into fights and stuff like that, but in my experience, I\u2019ve had like two passengers that were an issue.\u201d\n\nThe flight-attendant community feels like a family\n\nsource Mikhail TereshchenkoTASS via Getty Images\n\nSally Ann MacLagan, a flight attendant for Mesa Airlines, said she\u2019s been surprised by how the flight attendant community feels like a family no matter where she is.\n\n\u201cWe all have this huge sense of community,\u201d she said.\n\nYou learn something new every day\n\nsource Leonhard Foeger/Reuters\n\n\u201cIt might seem clich\u00e9, but I think I learn something new every day,\u201d a flight attendant for Alaska Airlines said.\n\nOne of the biggest lessons she\u2019s learned is to expect the unexpected.\n\n\u201cYou literally can\u2019t plan for everything, and that\u2019s what this job is going to show you,\u201d she said.\n\nThings don\u2019t change at home, even when you\u2019ve been away for a while\n\nsource Mehmet Ali Ozcan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI remember having anxiety about being away for long periods of time and my best friend reassuring me that I wasn\u2019t going to lose my connections with my friends and family, and it\u2019s true,\u201d a flight attendant for American Airlines said. \u201cI find myself being able to pick up right where we left off. The most surprising part is how little things change back home even when we\u2019re gone half the time.\u201d\n\nAre you a flight attendant? Do you have opinions about how much you\u2019re paid?
