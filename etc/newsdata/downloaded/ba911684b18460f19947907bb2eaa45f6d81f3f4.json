Just about a day after she released her new self-love ballad, \u201cLose You To Love Me\u201d, Selena Gomez has surprised fans with another new single called \u201cLook At Her Now\u201d, and honestly, I am living for this storytelling.\n\nWhile \u201cLose You To Love Me\u201d was an emotional song with an equally deep music video, \u201cLook At Her Now\u201d is the absolute opposite. And the lyrics, hoo boy.\n\nThe pre-chorus: \u201cNow she\u2019s glad she dodged a bullet / Took a few years to soak up the tears / But look at her now / Watch her go\u201d.\n\nShe\u2019s absolutely talking about Justin Bieber.\n\nAlso: \u201cShe knows she\u2019ll find love / Only if she wants it / She knows she\u2019ll find love / Look at her now\u201d.\n\nCelebrating the release on social media, Selena tweeted: \u201cAnd here\u2019s my special gift to all my ride or dies!\n\n\u201cI created this especially for you. Y\u2019all have been through it all with me and I thank you for pushing me to be the best.\u201d\n\nYou can stream \u201cLook At Her Now\u201d on all the usual services like Apple Music, Amazon Music, Google Play, YouTube Music, and Spotify right here.\n\nBOP ALERT.\n\n(once again, this video was shot entirely on an iPhone 11 Pro\u2026 which is really making my android ass quake)\n\nLook at her now. She\u2019s bloody thriving.\n\n\u201cI felt having these two songs released back to back completed the story of how one can rise no matter what challenges life brings,\u201d Selena said in a statement. \u201cTurning off the noise and living your life on your terms.\u201d\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, you can stream \u201cLose You To Love Me\u201d here.", "description": "Just about a day after she released \"Lose You To Love Me\",\u00a0Selena Gomez\u00a0has surprised fans with a second new single called\u00a0\"Look At Her Now\".", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-3.36.28-pm.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
