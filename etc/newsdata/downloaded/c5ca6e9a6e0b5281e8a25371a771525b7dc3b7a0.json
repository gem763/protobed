Attorney Emily Newton with the U.S. Department of Justice argued that Congress had ample national security reasons for the legislation.\n\nU.S. officials have long held that equipment made by Huawei, the world\u2019s largest maker of cellular equipment and the No. 2 smartphone vendor, behind Samsung Electronics Co. , could be tapped by Beijing and is a national security threat.\n\nMs. Newton said that Huawei is under Chinese law and connected to the country, including receiving tax incentives and research funding, providing an opportunity for \u201cexploitation.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has already sought to implement portions of the provisions targeting Huawei.\n\nThe case is being heard in a courtroom in a quiet town north of Dallas, not far from Huawei\u2019s U.S. headquarters in Plano, Texas. Judge Amos L. Mazzant III will await briefs from both parties over the next few weeks before issuing a ruling. He noted the magnitude of the case at the small courthouse, saying it\u2019s \u201cnot an issue that this court sees very often, if ever.\u201d\n\nThe sweeping defense policy act, signed into law by President Donald Trump last year, contains several provisions targeting Huawei, including one that seeks to ban federal agencies from buying equipment made by Huawei and other Chinese tech companies. Another provision would ban federal contractors from making significant use of such equipment.\n\nMs. Newton played down the impact on Huawei, saying it can continue to operate in the U.S. as long as federal funds aren\u2019t used. But Judge Mazzant said so much business is touched by federal contracts and grants, and a majority of what the company sells is affected.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking billions and billions that flow from the federal government that could be impacted here,\u201d the judge said.\n\nRelated Video The U.S. blacklisting of Huawei is cutting off American businesses from a big client.

Photo composite: Sharon Shi\n\nHuawei has repeatedly denied it would ever spy for any government, and says it is the target of a concerted U.S. campaign. Its equipment is effectively blocked from the U.S. market, though it is used around the world.\n\nJudge Mazzant noted that Congress can protect the U.S. from threats, but questioned whether the statute is essentially taking the company out of the market and wondered if there were other alternatives.\n\n\u201cCustomers are fleeing from the room, in a sense, because of this,\u201d the judge said.\n\nMr. Nager said Huawei has been \u201cseverely wounded\u201d by the law. \u201cWe\u2019ve now had to lay off half of the employees at Huawei USA since this law has gone into effect,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NDAA is one of several recent actions by the U.S. targeting Huawei. In May, the Commerce Department added Huawei to its \u201centity list,\u201d restricting its ability to buy U.S. components and software. The White House the same month issued an executive order banning U.S. companies from using telecom equipment made by firms beholden to \u201dforeign adversaries,\u201d widely seen as targeting Huawei and other Chinese companies.\n\n\u2014Dan Strumpf contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Tawnell D.
