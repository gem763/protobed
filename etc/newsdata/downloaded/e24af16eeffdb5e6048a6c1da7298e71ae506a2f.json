Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman features a young-looking Robert De Niro and now comes this very odd, dodgily acted, semi-intentionally bizarre action-thriller directed by Ang Lee and written by David Benioff, Billy Ray and Darren Lemke. It stars Will Smith as Brogan, a special-forces assassin who discovers his corrupt government paymasters are harbouring a secret and subsequently finds there is a new and worryingly familiar-looking young assassin in town. It\u2019s a youngster who has, to coin a phrase, started making trouble in the neighbourhood.\n\nAng Lee: 'I know I'm gonna get beat up. But I have to keep trying' Read more\n\nThis eerily recognisable young dude with the jarhead hair and lovable jug ears has been sent to take Brogan out \u2013 it\u2019s himself, aged 23, a digitally rejuvenated Will Smith. This cloned version of Brogan was secretly created by his creepy boss Varris (Clive Owen) as part of Varris\u2019s ethically suspect \u201cGemini project\u201d, a boys-from-Brazil-type plan to create biotech copies of the very best warriors.\n\nJoining forces with tough agent Danny (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and plucky pal Baron (Benedict Wong), Brogan hits back against this techno-Freudian nightmare, travelling to Georgia, Colombia and Hungary \u2013 because Baron has somehow been able to borrow a Gulfstream jet to fly them everywhere. But worrying about the plausibility of that jet is beside the point when you\u2019ve got Young Will Smith\u2122\ufe0f running around the place.\n\nThe digitally de-wrinkled Smith isn\u2019t great news for the career of Jaden Smith (the real-world son of Will) because this pseudo-young Will Smith is pretty realistic, in fact sort of on a par with the real thing \u2013 and the older Smith meets the digital youngster half way by being a bit more wooden than usual. So we could be in for Will Smith action movies for the next thousand years.\n\nThe technical effect of the film is strange. As with his last film, Billy Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk, Ang Lee is shooting in high frame-rate, which creates a new pin-sharp clarity but at the expense of making the film look like video \u2013 or like a celluloid movie on a plasma TV when you haven\u2019t de-activated motion smoothing. It\u2019s not a taste I want to acquire.\n\nSome of the fight scenes are great, and there\u2019s a rousing confrontation between Smiths young and old, involving some nifty leaping from roof to roof that reminded me of Lee\u2019s cracking early film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The juxtaposition of the real and digital faces gives the initial motorbike action scenes an interesting Grand Theft Auto effect. But the rest of the film is a very hard slog, with Smith in permanent danger of being upstaged by a handful of pixels, and Winstead and Wong sporting the slightly bemused-neutral expression of people having to react to a green screen \u2013 or perhaps that is the response Smith naturally elicits from his co-stars these days. And this solemn film never really cottons on to something that could have made it fly: the comic possibilities.\n\nThe digital novelty is striking for the first 10 minutes, silly for the next 10 minutes, and by the end of the movie you\u2019re pining for the analogue values of script and direction. A wittier, smarter riff on everything could have saved this and Smith can play lighter material. Gemini Man has been born under an unfortunate sign.", "description": "The digital de-ageing gimmick adds little sprightliness to Ang Lee\u2019s humourless thriller about a government agent on the run", "authors": ["Peter Bradshaw"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d6cbdb96794ef185cd4c42ad4dce40143eb4363/63_0_1652_991/master/1652.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=03816d7a908efd9bc23db5776da48347", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
