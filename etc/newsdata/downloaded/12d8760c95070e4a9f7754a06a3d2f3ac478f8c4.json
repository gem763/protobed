The protesters sat in the car lanes and blocked traffic at the busy port of entry for several hours. At one point in the protest, children began chanting, \u201cWe want to study, we want to study!\u201d according to the ACLU\u2019s Rochelle Garza.\n\nMore than 50,000 migrants have been enrolled in the Remain in Mexico program since the Trump administration officially launched it in late January to limit the release of asylum-seekers into the U.S. Immigrants\u2019 rights advocates have criticized the policy, officially known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, for putting asylum-seekers in danger. The protesters were reportedly trying to draw attention to the squalid conditions they\u2019ve been forced to live in because of the Remain in Mexico policy.\n\n\n\nWhile some migrants forced to wait out their cases in Mexico have found apartments or live in shelters run by nonprofits and religious organizations, thousands of others live in makeshift encampments near the bridge, along with other migrants who haven\u2019t even been able to ask for asylum yet because of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmetering\u201d policy, which limits how many people can cross into the U.S. each day. Migrants forced to wait in Mexico are frequently preyed on by gangs and drug cartels, who target them for kidnapping and extortion.\n\nThe Remain in Mexico program hasn\u2019t just put migrants in danger; it\u2019s also made it much harder for them to show up to their court dates, hindering their ability to be granted asylum in the U.S.\n\nCover: Migrants gather next to the border fence after camping out on the Gateway International Bridge that connects downtown Matamoros, Mexico with Brownsville, Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019.
