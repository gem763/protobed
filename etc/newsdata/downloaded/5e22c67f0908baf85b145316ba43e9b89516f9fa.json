Slim chance (Picture: Getty/ITV/Rex)\n\nAfter working his magic with the KSI and Logan Paul boxing match, promoter Eddie Hearn has his eyes set on Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy.\n\nIt comes after the two women got into a rather heated back and forth that set the world alight, after Coleen \u2013 who is married to Wayne Rooney \u2013 accused Rebekah of \u2018selling stories\u2019 about her in the press.\n\nRebekah \u2013 who is the wife of Jamie Vardy \u2013 hit back and denied the rumours, with claims she\u2019s now asked for a forensic investigation of her phone to find the culprit who may have been leaking social media posts to the press.\n\nIt\u2019s a drama fit for a TV movie, or, for Eddie, the boxing ring.\n\nSpeaking to IFL TV he was asked whether he was considering putting Coleen and Rebekah on the KSI/Logan Paul undercard next month.\n\nEddie shared his thoughts on the chance they\u2019d box (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nA tough chance that will ever come off, but Eddie is remaining positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I must say, I did find that fascinating this morning. And I loved Coleen Rooney the way she wrote out like blah blah blah,\u2019 Eddie beautifully detailed.\n\n\u2018And I was like obviously she\u2019s not going to say [who it is], and obviously it\u2019s just a mate \u2013 and it was \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account\u201d. Dun dun dun. And Rebekah Vardy came back and said other people have access to her Instagram account, so\u2026\u2019\n\nHe\u2019s promoting KSI and Logan Paul\u2019s fight (Picture: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nAs he was pushed on whether or not he\u2019d push for the chance to promote such a fight, he continued: \u2018Shut up mate. I\u2019m only doing KSI against Logan Paul, they have had a fight before.\u2019\n\nBut still, if he got them together for a charity match it might work out.\n\n\u2018For Sport Relief I would yeah. For charity,\u2019 he continued.\n\n\u2018You know what, they\u2019d probably be quite decent as well. It would be massive wouldn\u2019t it? How many buyers? A million buys!\u2019\n\nYesterday Coleen levelled the dramatic accusations at her fellow WAG, revealing she\u2019d been working behind the scenes to try and expose whoever was allegedly leaking fake news to the press.\n\nShe cited several examples of stories and insisted she took screenshots.\n\n\u2018For a few years now someone I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories,\u2019 she wrote on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion. To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\n\n\u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\nRebekah has denied the allegations (Picture: Jean Catuffe/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nRebekah fired back in her own statement, writing: \u2018As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this. I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me over the years can vouch for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself.\u2019\n\nThe reality star continued: \u2018I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen and I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
