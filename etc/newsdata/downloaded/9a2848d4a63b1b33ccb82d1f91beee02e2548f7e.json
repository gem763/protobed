When it closed he was bereft \u2013 would opening his own as an adult help to right that wrong?\n\nAuthor Jacqueline Woodson recently spoke about books being either mirrors or windows. Mirrors for seeing ourselves, and windows for seeing into other worlds. Growing up, I enjoyed both types of books, from the realistic contemporary fiction of Judy Blume to the epic fantasy of JRR Tolkien. I had access to books by these and every author in between courtesy of a bookstore a short drive from my house. I didn\u2019t understand my privilege then, but I\u2019ve come to understand it better over time.\n\nIn the short time that it was open, I developed interests that would shape my career. I grew up at the advent of personal computing, and the books I read helped me along a path to becoming a programmer. I also developed a deep appreciation for comics, thanks to an expansive humour section at the bookstore. Those comic collections helped to prepare me for my dream career as a cartoonist. Had we not had a bookstore nearby during my formative years, I would have grown up to be a completely different person.\n\nOur local bookstore went out of business a few years after it opened, and I\u2019ll never forget the confusion and hurt I felt when I saw the darkened windows for the first time. It was my first experience of losing something that seemed so obviously good.\n\nAnd so when I found myself in a position, many years later, to open a bookstore in my adopted hometown of Plainville, Massachusetts, I was eager to make it happen. It felt like a way of righting the wrong that I experienced as a kid, while at the same time fighting back against the creeping suffocation of a world that was changing a little too quickly. But long before we opened our doors, we needed to actually build the doors. And the walls, and the floors, and everything else that went into the construction of what we would come to call An Unlikely Story.\n\nMy wife and I moved to Plainville 17 years ago, and it\u2019s where we\u2019ve raised our children. Most towns in Massachusetts have followed a similar trajectory: the town grows around an industry, then the industry moves on, but the people stay. People work and shop outside the town, which leads to an abandonment of the downtown and a slow, sad decay of its structures. Such was the case in Plainville. At the centre of our downtown was Falk\u2019s Market, a general store that was once the nerve centre of the community. It was operated by Merrill Falk, a beloved shopkeeper whose passing left the building shuttered and empty for 17 years. By the time my wife and I purchased the building, the centre was caved in, and there was not a scrap of wood that was salvageable. The only way to save the place was to tear it down.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Long before we opened our doors to customers, we needed to actually build the doors\u2019 \u2026 Kinneys store.

At the time, we lived in quiet anonymity, and we knew that if we built a structure in the centre of town, we would be operating in a fishbowl. We knew that there would be complications and setbacks. But it felt like a risk worth taking. We wanted our children to be proud of the town in which they lived, and we wanted to create a place where the community could come together. And so we started digging.\n\nOne scoop of earth was all it took for our troubles to begin in earnest. The hole filled with water, which meant the water table was at least three metres higher than the engineers expected. And there was a sheen of oil in the water, which meant it was contaminated by a prior spill. That one scoop caused progress to come to a halt, and what a halt it was.\n\nBecause the water table was so high, we had to massively revise our plans. We would need to build the basement underwater, which meant we would have to create a huge outer shell to encase the foundation. We would be building in a giant concrete bathtub.\n\nThe oil presented serious problems, too. We had to declare the construction area a hazardous waste site and move all of the contaminated soil to another location. The now-giant hole filled with rainwater and, for an entire summer, the stagnant pond we created in the middle of town became the region\u2019s largest mosquito magnet. Operating in a fishbowl took on a new meaning.\n\nOnce construction began, costs climbed. As time went on, the original estimate more than tripled. Progress was slow and anxiety was high.\n\nWhat kept us going was a narrative our architect had written. It described a few imaginary scenarios that might happen once we opened the bookstore. Two old\u2011timers meet for the first time in years over cups of coffee in the cafe. Young mothers exploring the children\u2019s section bump into one another as strangers, and leave with plans for a play date for their children. The kind of stuff that strengthens connections and forms new ones. Community. That was our North Star.\n\nTwo years after we tore down Falk\u2019s Market, we opened the doors to our customers for the first time. A handful of eager people rushed in to investigate our shelves lined with books, toys and games. The adults gravitated to the cafe and chatted while their children found books they liked and sat in cosy leather chairs. Heaven.\n\nWe\u2019ve had several romances develop from first dates in the cafe, and one couple is getting married this autumn\n\nWord quickly spread, and within a few months we were developing a new parking lot across the street. Authors, some famous and some not-so-famous, gave book talks in our second-floor event space. In the four years since we\u2019ve opened, we\u2019ve welcomed Rick Riordan (Percy Jackson), Dav Pilkey (Dog Man), Kate DiCamillo (Because of Winn-Dixie), Raina Telgemeier (Smile), and David Walliams \u2013 twice. They have come to this tiny town of Plainville, population 8,000, and they have touched many lives, including my own.\n\nBetter still, the stories that the architect conjured pale in comparison with the real stories that take place in our space. We\u2019ve had several romances develop from first dates in the cafe, and one couple is getting married this autumn. A woman who wrote about growing up in Plainville in the 1920s spoke at the store and drew a giant crowd. Her family said that it was the best day of her life. She passed away two weeks later.\n\nPrivilege as a child meant having a bookstore in my town. Now, my privilege has taken a different form. I was very lucky to find an audience for my own books, and without the success I have had, I could never have opened a bookstore of my own, let alone build one. I get to visit independent bookstores around the world every year while I am on tour, and I am in awe of the courageous, dedicated people who pour their lives into creating these magical spaces \u2013 often without much of a financial reward.\n\nThese days, I am more interested in books that serve as windows rather than mirrors. My favourite thing to do is to sit in the audience on our second floor and listen to the story of an author who doesn\u2019t look like me and who has had a very different life experience from my own.\n\nIt\u2019s enriching, inspiring, and it\u2019s a privilege indeed.\n\n\u2022 Jeff Kinney\u2019s Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Wrecking Ball is published by Puffin on 5 November.
