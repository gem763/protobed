A stylist. A photographer. A lighting crew, wind machine, props, and a computer...asking you to think I woke up like this,\" Aniston wrote in the caption, putting a new spin on Julia Roberts' iconic quote from \"Notting Hill\" and the famous Beyonc\u00e9 lyric.\n\nThe photo was an instant hit on Aniston's Instagram, racking up more than five million likes and plenty of comments from fellow celebrities, including her ex-husband Justin Theroux.\n\n\"Modern Family\" star Sarah Hyland commented that the \"Friends\" star had \"already mastered Instagram,\" while producer Aleen Keshishian wrote that only Aniston could \"look that hot in socks and sandals.\"\n\n\"Truth is you kinda do look like that when you wake up,\" added actress Rita Wilson.\n\nAniston made sure to give credit to the people involved in the photo shoot, tagging McMillan along with makeup artist Tracey Levey, her stylist team Nina and Clare Hallworth, and photographer Peggy Sirota.\n\nThe photo shoot was for the cover of Variety's Power of Women issue. Aniston was one of the magazine's six honorees, alongside Mariah Carey, Awkwafina, Chaka Khan, Brie Larson, and Dana Walden, the chairman of Disney Television Studios and ABC Entertainment.\n\nAniston joined Instagram on October 15 with an epic selfie alongside her \"Friends\" costars Lisa Kudrow, Courtney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, and Matthew Perry.\n\nHer debut Instagram post received so much attention that it briefly led to technical problems on the app and even broke the Guinness World Record for the quickest Instagram account to reach one million followers.\n\nIt took Aniston just five hours and 16 minutes to reach the milestone, unseating the record previously held by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's official Instagram account @sussexroyal.\n\nIn the past, Aniston said she opted to stay off social media to maintain a small slice of privacy in her life\n\n\"The one thing I have is maintaining this little circle of sanctity that's my own, she told Elle Magazine in 2018. \"If I'm sitting here posting something about my dogs or I'm Boomeranging my coffee mug in the morning, that's just giving away one more piece of something that is mine.\"\n\nBut Aniston, who next appears in the Apple TV+ series \"The Morning Show\" alongside Reese Witherspoon, has already become a favourite on Instagram, opting for candid posts and grainy photos rather than slick picture-perfect shots.\n\nAniston recently spoke about how she discovered her own voice and \"what it meant to have a platform to use it.\"\n\nDuring Variety's Power of Women luncheon on October 11, Aniston revealed that a parental figure once ordered her to leave the dinner table because she \"didn't have anything interesting to add to the conversation.\" She was just 11 years old.\n\n\"I carried that sentence with me into adulthood,\" Aniston added.\n\nBut after \"Friends\" aired, Aniston said she realised just how powerful her voice could be.\n\n\"I started meeting all of these people who expressed to me how much the show meant to them - how it lifted their spirits during a bad breakup or got them through an illness. I was just so incredibly moved by that,\" she said. \"And I began to change the way I thought about my own voice.\"\n\n\"These last two years have really made me think a lot about the messages we send young kids - little girls especially,\" she added. \"How the things we say and do can either build them up - or tear them down. And make them feel like maybe their voices don't matter.\"\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The photo was an instant hit on Aniston's Instagram, racking up more than five million likes and plenty of comments from fellow celebrities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9504/e3f43b0749b2493dbd5fc4cc2309f1ca.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
