Afterward, Arsenal boss Unai Emery criticised a lack of consistency from the match officials.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s Manchester United missed two penalties \u2013 both awarded after VAR interventions \u2013 in a 3-1 win over Daniel Farke\u2019s Norwich City.\n\nBoth managers were far from impressed with the decisions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be unhappy to get the first one against me, but Marcus (Rashford) did the honourable thing and missed it,\u201d joked Solskjaer.\n\nRELENTLESS LIVERPOOL MARCH ON\n\nLiverpool captain Jordan Henderson believes an improved mentality under coach Juergen Klopp ensured they came from behind to overpower Tottenham Hotspur and restore their six-point lead at the top of the league table.\n\nStriker Harry Kane found the net for Spurs inside a minute to stun the home crowd at Anfield on Sunday but Liverpool grinded out a victory after second-half goals from Henderson and Mohamed Salah.\n\n\u201cMentality \u2013 that\u2019s grown over the last few years. The gaffer has changed that so much in us,\u201d Henderson said.\n\n\u201cWhenever we face adversity we bounce back and we need to carry that right through the season because it\u2019s not going to go all our own way.\u201d\n\nXHAKA OUTBURST PILES ON ARSENAL AGONY\n\nArsenal captain Granit Xhaka clashed with home supporters in a dramatic incident during Sunday\u2019s 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace, sparking concerns over his future at the north London club.\n\nAfter the decision to substitute him was greeted with sarcastic cheers and booing at the Emirates Stadium, an incensed Xhaka cupped his hand to his ear as he stormed down the tunnel.\n\nArsenal boss Unai Emery refused to rule out stripping Xhaka of the club captaincy, while former striker Ian Wright wants the player to issue an apology to the fans.\n\n\u201cArsenal fans have been patient with him. He owes them a lot more than that,\u201d Wright told BBC. \u201cHe should apologise. That\u2019s the guy Arsenal have chosen as captain\u2026 that\u2019s not captain behaviour.\u201d\n\nPATIENCE WITH PULISIC PAYS OFF FOR CHELSEA\n\nChristian Pulisic has taken his time finding feet at Chelsea since joining the west London club from Borussia Dortmund in the close season but the winger\u2019s hat-trick against Burnley offered a timely reminder of his best qualities.\n\nPulisic has had to be patient in the face of stiff competition from Chelsea\u2019s other young forwards and manager Frank Lampard\u2019s decision to give the American time to adjust to his new surroundings now appears to be a smart choice.\n\n\u201cIt was a special day,\u201d the winger said after Chelsea had won 4-2. \u201cI just want to be on the field, help the team and make an impact.\u201d\n\nGUARDIOLA WISHES LAPORTE BACK AMID DEFENSIVE CRISIS\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola concedes the absence of Aymeric Laporte could prove critical when the club\u2019s stretched defensive resources face elite oppositions this season.\n\nThe Premier League champions lost Oleksandr Zinchenko and Rodri, who had been covering at centre back in recent matches, to injuries last week as they join long-term absentee Laporte on the sidelines.\n\nCity\u2019s recorded a convincing 3-0 win over Aston Villa on Saturday but Fernandinho gave Guardiola another defensive blow when he was sent off late in the match.\n\n\u201cI wish we had Laporte and everyone else come back,\u201d said Guardiola, who will be without Fernandinho for Tuesday\u2019s League Cup match against Southampton.\n\n\u201cOf course, against top teams when you don\u2019t have the players who play in their own position I don\u2019t know what happens.\n\n\u201cBut before it is going to happen I am not going to say \u2018it is a disaster\u2019.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Not a single penalty or red card was given by VAR (video assistant referee) in the opening nine rounds of the Premier League, but on the weekend it made headlines by overturning five key decisions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PL.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
