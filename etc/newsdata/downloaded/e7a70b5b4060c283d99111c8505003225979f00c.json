REUTERS/Sankalp Phartiyal\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Technology firms must protect user privacy and prevent abuse of their platforms, India\u2019s IT minister said on Thursday, speaking as the government draws up a data privacy law and seeks to push companies to store more data locally.\n\nFederal Information and Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said he wanted Indians to have access to more technology platforms but said this should not undermine user privacy.\n\n\u201cI have only one caveat - it must be safe and secure, it must safeguard the privacy rights of the individual and you must make extra efforts that people don\u2019t abuse the system,\u201d Prasad told industry executives at a gathering organized by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google in New Delhi.\n\nIndia\u2019s 1.3 billion people and their massive consumption of mobile data has turned it into a key growth market for U.S. technology giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon.\n\nIndia has already forced foreign payment firms such as Mastercard Inc and Visa Inc to store data locally.\n\nTechnology firms have been concerned that the government\u2019s drive to step up measures to boost local data storage will increase investment costs.\n\nGoogle said at the event that it had launched a new job-search feature on its Google Pay platform, which is used by 67 million people in a month and competes with SoftBank-backed Paytm and Walmart Inc\u2019s PhonePe.\n\nGoogle also expanded its artificial intelligence-based voice assistant service to feature phones by partnering with one of India\u2019s top telecom carriers in a country where more than 300 million use 2G devices.", "description": "Technology firms must protect user privacy and prevent abuse of their platforms, India's IT minister said on Thursday, speaking as the government draws up a data privacy law and seeks to push companies to store more data locally.", "authors": ["Sankalp Phartiyal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431619181&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I16A", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
