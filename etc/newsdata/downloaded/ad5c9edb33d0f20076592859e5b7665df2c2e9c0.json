Did Alfred Hitchcock destroy reels of \"Vertigo\"?\n\nOf course not. So why are Republicans waging war against California, their party\u2019s greatest masterpiece?\n\nFor all the denunciations of California as a Democratic bastion, the larger, historic truth is exactly the opposite: Modern California is in almost all respects the creation of Republicans. Even now, when Democrats hold so many elected offices, the structures of this place remain fundamentally Republican.\n\nIndeed, the state of California and the Republican Party were born at the same time and grew up together. Both owe a debt to John C. Fremont, the U.S. Army officer who in 1846 declared a republic in California, then part of Mexico. He then became California\u2019s first U.S. senator, and, in 1856, the first Republican presidential nominee. Fremont\u2019s volatile personality \u2014 including talents for controversy and insubordination \u2014 still define his state and his party.\n\nPioneering corruption and fighting it\n\nBut Fremont\u2019s impact pales in comparison to that of Leland Stanford, our first Republican governor, elected in 1861. In scandalous, self-dealing fashion, Stanford linked California to the country with his railroads, and gave us our greatest private university. In the process, Stanford established the template for the disruptive, corrupt, (if public-spirited) California oligarch embodied by Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk today.\n\nTo be fair, Republicans in California did more than pioneer corruption: they found new ways to counter it. In the early 20th century, Republicans \u2014 notably popular governor and U.S. Sen. Hiram Johnson \u2014 backed women\u2019s suffrage and established the initiative and referendum process that still dominates California governance. Under Progressive Republicans, the state pursued environmental conservation measures and adopted a corporatized government bureaucracy, with independent commissions, such as the Public Utilities Commission, that still hold sway a century later.\n\nAn \"IMPEACH\" electronic billboard in San Francisco on Oct. 15, 2019.

So even as the Depression and Second World War built up an American welfare state, California largely skipped the New Deal and remained an ungenerous, if wide-open, place. When Republicans spent money, they devoted the dollars to institutions.\n\nGov. Earl Warren, easily the most distinguished California Republican of all time, made plans and saved money for expansion of our universities, roads and water systems. Warren, as governor and U.S. Supreme Court chief justice, combined support for civil rights with protection of the national security agencies and corporations that would build California\u2019s aerospace industry and birth Silicon Valley.\n\nKey Nixon and Reagan legacies\n\nCheerleading this growth were America\u2019s two most important 20th century Republicans. California-born Richard Nixon, while he pioneered our now-dominant brand of conspiracy-minded, race-baiting politics, made history in government by establishing the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Ronald Reagan set up California\u2019s smog-fighting Air Resources Board and legalized abortion as governor, and as president embraced the forces that still shape our economy and culture: free trade and immigration.\n\nReagan also inspired the tax revolt, including the 1978 ballot initiative Proposition 13 that remains the foundation of California governance. The Proposition 13 system helps keep our school funding at levels closer to that of Republican Mississippi than of Democratic Massachusetts.\n\nMore recent Republican governors left their marks. Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example, established the climate change regime \u2014 based on the Republican idea of a cap-and-trade system \u2014 that stands at the heart of California policymaking today.\n\nTrump GOP sees enemy in mirror\n\nYes, Democrats have now ruled Sacramento for nearly a decade. But, remarkably, they have been willing to accept \u2014 and even celebrate \u2014 the historic, and very Republican, California consensus.\n\nJerry Brown, on fiscal matters, was more hostile to spending than his conservative predecessors. California\u2019s poverty and inequality persist at levels antithetical to Democratic talking points. And while Gavin Newsom has vowed to transform the state in a progressive fashion, he\u2019s so far governed as a fiscal steward and portrayed himself primarily as a father in a family tableau so white-bread it would make country club members blush.\n\nBut now, in the face of all this Republican history and Republican reality, President Donald Trump\u2019s Republicans look in the California mirror and somehow see the enemy. And so they make war against all of our Republican-ness \u2014 our direct democracy, our commitment to environment and health, our technological supremacy, our love of immigration and free trade, our tradition of independent governance and regulation. Nixon and Reagan, those great California anti-communists, must spin in their graves as the president seeks election help from China\u2019s communists, and writes love notes to the dictator in Pyongyang.\n\nThis is an ugly war that today\u2019s national Republicans now wage against us. And it already has its victims, most tragically the immigrants lawlessly locked in federal detention. Let\u2019s pray the GOP considers history and retreats from this dark turn. Because you can\u2019t win a war that you fight against yourself.\n\nJoe Mathews writes the Connecting California column for Z\u00f3calo Public Square. This column first appeared in the Desert Sun.
