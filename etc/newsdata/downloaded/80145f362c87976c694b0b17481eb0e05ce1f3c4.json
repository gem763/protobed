Your legacy will live on forever\".\n\n\"I wish I could give you a kiss and tell you I love you one last time. You had such an amazing heart and no human can ever replace you.\n\n\"I think about you everyday,\" said Chloe.\n\nChester's wife Maria said she would \"cherish our love for each other forever. He was and always will be the best father to his children,\" said Maria.\n\nRepresenting government, Mthethwa, like many speakers before him, spoke about the inspiration Williams was.\n\n\"Words seem to be inadequate to express how we feel about his passing. He defied obstacles that were meant to diminish him to oblivion,\" said Mthethwa in tribute.\n\nMthethwa said Williams always, by his own admission, wanted to become a Springbok and \"he worked hard to become a Springbok\".\n\n\"His life was personified by hard work, determination and resilience. His inclusion in the 1995 Springboks world cup winning side was a symbol of hope for marginalised players. Nothing is harder than saying goodbye to someone of your calibre,\" said Mthethwa.", "description": "Chester Williams' daughter told those gathered to bid farewell to the rugby icon that she was not prepared for the loss of her father so soon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9330/920fef15bb2b4abcb5eec70e785c450d.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
