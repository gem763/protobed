Pictured: A map of how Britain voted in the 2016 referendum\n\n'We wanted to see if there was in fact systematic evidence for these concerns by surveying migrants living across the UK using established measures.\n\n'We found participants who lived in areas of the UK with a higher percentage of Leave voters experienced a sharper increase in discrimination over time.'\n\nHe said the findings showed this was then associated with increases in symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder.\n\nFor example, migrants living in Leave areas are around three times more likely to suffer anxiety than those in Remain areas.\n\nVolunteers were surveyed three times, during which they were quizzed about their worries and how often they experienced discrimination.\n\nParticipants were asked to complete The Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7) - a scoring system made up of seven questions.\n\nWHAT IS ANXIETY? Anxiety is a normal part of life that affects different people in different ways at different times. Whereas stress can come and go, anxiety often persists and does not always have an obvious cause. Along with depression, anxiety is among the most common mental-health condition in the UK, affecting 8.2million people in 2013 alone. Around 40million adults suffer from the condition in the US every year. Anxiety can make a person imagine things in their life are worse than they are or that they are going mad. Although it evolved as part of the 'fight or flight' mechanism in our caveman days to avoid danger, anxiety can be inappropriately activated in everyday life when stress builds up. It can have a clear cause, such as moving house or having surgery. However, sometimes little life events build up until a person is unable to cope, with anxiety then taking them by surprise. Physical symptoms can include: Increased heart rate and muscle tension\n\nHyperventilation and dizziness\n\nNausea\n\nA tight band across the chest\n\nTension headaches\n\nHot flushes\n\nSweating\n\n'Jelly legs'\n\nShaking\n\nFeeling like you are choking\n\nTingling in the hands and feet Some psychological symptoms are: Thinking you are going mad or losing control\n\nThinking you may die or get ill\n\nFeeling people are staring at you\n\nFeeling detached from others or on edge Treatment often involves counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy. Activates like yoga, exercise, reading and socialising can help to manage anxiety.\n\nThey are quizzed on their mood and how easy they find it to relax. Response options include 'not at all', 'several days', 'more than half the days' and 'nearly every day'.\n\nScores of five, 10, and 15 represent mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively.\n\nVolunteers were also asked separately about how often they experienced nine types of discrimination at three points during 2017.\n\nThese ranged from being treated with less courtesy to being harassed.\n\nData was cross-referenced with voting records from their local areas, obtained from the UK Electoral Commission.\n\nIt showed there was a three-fold increase in the number of symptoms of clinical anxiety in areas with a strong Leave presence.\n\nThe findings held true when other factors associated with discrimination and anxiety were accounted for, including ethnicity and age.\n\nMigrants from the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand were excluded because they experience privileged status in the UK.\n\nDr Frost added: 'These findings indicate that the post-Brexit social climate is not only hostile, but also harmful for migrants living in the UK.\n\n'Politicians, community leaders, and health professionals all need to be more aware of how the Brexit debate has impacted the lives of migrants in the UK in order to take steps to improve the social climate and address its negative effects on their well-being.'\n\nAnxiety affects around eight million people in the UK. Around 40million adults suffer from the condition in the US.\n\nThe findings were published in the American Psychological Association's Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology.\n\nThe study comes after doctors revealed a father had become the first person to suffer from Brexit-triggered psychosis last month.\n\nThe patient, in his forties and from Nottingham, was so ill following the referendum he tried to burrow out of hospital with his bare hands.\n\nHe even feared that one of his wife's relatives was going to shoot him with a heat-seeking missile, and heard voices in his head.\n\nThe patient was increasingly worried about racial incidents and said he was ashamed to be British following the 2016 poll.", "description": "Researchers from University College London looked at 300 migrants living in Britain between February and October 2017 - seven months after the referendum.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/14/20083596-0-image-a-13_1571835949087.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
