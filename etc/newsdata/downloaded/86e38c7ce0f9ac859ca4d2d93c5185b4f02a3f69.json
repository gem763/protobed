It\u2019s deep state lizard conspiracy, and everyone\u2019s in on it. The CIA, the FBI, the MIC, the KEY, and the MOUSE,\u201d Strong\u2019s character bemoaned.\n\nA man playing a member of \u201cBikers for Trump\u201d then joined Baldwin on stage to warn Democrats against impeachment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from Bikers for Trump. And if they try to get rid of you, then all of us bikers are going to ride,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this man did is shakedown a foreign government to get dirt on his political enemy, I mean, is that wrong?\u201d\n\nThe sketch also focused on Trump\u2019s recent decision to pull U.S. troops from northern Syria, with comedian Pete Davidson portraying a freed Islamic State terrorist militant from the region, thanking him for \u201cbringing jobs back to ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Mr. President,\u201d Davidson says. \u201cI was a prisoner in Syria until last week when you freed me, so I just want to say thank you for bringing jobs back to ISIS. And I promise that I will make ISIS great again!\u201d\n\nBaldwin has repeatedly dithered about his commitment to playing Trump on the iconic NBC show, last year confirming that he would only reprise his role occasionally.\n\n\u201cI have fun doing it, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Baldwin said of his role. \u201cThey are all old and dear friends of mine, and I love going there. When the show is good, there is nothing like it. But for me, I think I\u2019m going to do some of it, but not a whole lot. Because I also think, and this is critical, there is a lot of fatigue here.\u201d\n\nThe 60-year-old actor is one of Hollywood\u2019s most fervent critics of the Trump presidency, describing him as a \u201cNational Socialist tumor\u201d that is growing \u201cday by day\u201d and destroying America in the process.\n\n\u201cTrump is insane. I think most people know, the guy \u2013 he is insane. We have a man who is the president who is insane,\u201d Baldwin said last year. \u201cYou can\u2019t go far enough with this idiot. You can\u2019t go far enough.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Alec Baldwin made a return to\u00a0\"Saturday Night Live,\" reprising his role as Donald Trump as the show took aim at the president's voters.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/snlmockmaga1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
