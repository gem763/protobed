And so Barrett, the younger brother of star playmaker Beauden Barrett, will run out in the No. 10 jersey at Tokyo Stadium as the All Blacks look to confirm a quarterfinals spot. In another surprise, his backup is scrumhalf TJ Perenara, who has never played flyhalf for New Zealand either.\n\nWith only a four-day turnaround after beating Canada 63-0 on Wednesday in Oita, New Zealand wanted to field as many fresh players as possible. So there were 13 changes to the starting lineup.\n\nBrodie Retallick, a former world player of the year, will make his first appearance in 10 weeks, since he dislocated his left shoulder against South Africa in July. He\u2019s delighted to play a week earlier than expected, and resume his lock partnership with Sam Whitelock, who has the captaincy from the rested Kieran Read.\n\nJordie Barrett, who played a full game against Canada on the wing, said he\u2019s covered 10 for Super Rugby\u2019s Hurricanes, and last started there for his university team. With Damian McKenzie injured before the tournament, and the All Blacks bringing only two 10s in Richie Mo\u2019unga and Beauden Barrett, Jordie has been running there in camp, along with others, as the coaches have tried to broaden their options.\n\nHansen admitted Jordie\u2019s future was as a wing-fullback but they needed him at 10 for now, and gave him about 52 hours to get ready.\n\n\u201cOne, he has played there before at a lower level,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cTwo, he has got the skills set, we believe, to be able to run the game. And (he has) the confidence and skills to be able to execute as well as run it. We\u2019re reasonably confident he will be fine.\n\n\u201cHe has plenty of swagger, he\u2019s not short of it. I don\u2019t think you can mistake swagger or confidence with arrogance. He\u2019s not an arrogant boy. He\u2019s a humble kid. He will be looking forward to it. He will get out there and boss the team.\u201d\n\nJordie said he\u2019d already spoken briefly to Beauden and Mo\u2019unga.\n\n\u201cI feel well prepared,\u201d Jordie said. \u201cThe beauty about the 10 days (off) before Canada, we had time to understand our structures and game plan and what we want to get out of these two games.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a few adjustments I\u2019ll have to make (from wing). It\u2019s more just set-piece and timings. I\u2019ll have to equip myself over the next 48 hours so I can perform on Sunday.\u201d\n\nHansen said Perenara will back up Jordie, and the third scrumhalf in the squad, Brad Weber, will back up starting scrumhalf Aaron Smith.\n\nSmith said Perenara had been training at 10 in camp, and was excited about it.\n\n\u201cThere was a joke this morning,\u201d Smith said, \u201cthat all three 9s could be out there because Brad\u2019s quick enough to be a wing. It would be awesome. There\u2019d be plenty of chat!\u201d\n\nBut Hansen had to tell the 9s to focus on their jobs.\n\n\u201cJordie\u2019s the boss and they\u2019re not. They might think they\u2019re the boss but not really,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cNo. 10s are your game computers, they make the choice about what to do. If 9s start making choices, you end up with chaos.\u201d\n\nHansen said Retallick will be eased back, playing no more than 30-40 minutes against Namibia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to have Brodie back,\u201d the coach said. \u201cThe medical staff have done some extremely good work with him. His prehab and rehab work has been outstanding, and Mother Nature, I suppose. He\u2019s a good healer. Let\u2019s just hope he stays healed.\u201d\n\nBy coincidence, Namibia\u2019s own flyhalf, Helarius Axasman Kisting, is starting a test at 10 for the first time in his 11th test. The regular, Clive Loubser, has a swollen ankle after losing to South Africa 57-3 last weekend.\n\n\u201c(Kisting) plays club rugby in Romania and he\u2019s gone there on his own,\u201d Namibia coach Phil Davies said. \u201cI admire his resilience and ambition to improve himself and provide for his family. He\u2019s a very rounded young guy. He\u2019s got good handling skills, he\u2019ll be a nice attacking threat for us.\u201d\n\nThe Namibia selection resembles more the lineup which lost its opener to Italy 47-22 in Fukuoka, with nine of the starting XV back, and a first appearance in this World Cup for flanker Prince Gaoseb, the youngest player in their squad at 21.\n\nCenter and captain Johan Deysel has also recovered to start. Deysel scored a try in Namibia\u2019s only previous match against New Zealand, a 58-14 loss in the 2015 World Cup.\n\n\u201cIt had a big impact on my life. A lot of people remember that try,\u201d Deysel said. \u201cIt sort of put Namibia on the map, and that can happen to any young player on Sunday.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nNew Zealand: Ben Smith, Sevu Reece, Jack Goodhue, Anton Linert-Brown, George Bridge, Jordie Barrett, Aaron Smith; Ardie Savea, Sam Cane, Shannon Frizell, Sam Whitelock (captain), Brodie Retallick, Nepo Laulala, Codie Taylor, Joe Moody.
