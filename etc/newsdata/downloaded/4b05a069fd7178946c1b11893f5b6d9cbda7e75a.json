A founder of the Time's Up initiative, she famously introduced the \"all-male nominees\" for best director at the 2018 Golden Globes, and a few months later, called on women to band together, fight for equal pay and diversify their social and professional circles.\n\nIn her speech Tuesday, she reiterated the importance of female solidarity, particularly in the entertainment industry.\n\n\"Of course here, everyone is super talented and smart but also easy to be around. Because if you are a woman and you're a pain in the a--, you will not get another job. And meanwhile, how will we know if we've reached equality?\" she said. \"Is it going to be when this room is a room of successful women and it's full of a--holes? Is it going to be when our movies tank and then we get a raise the next time? Is it going to be when we commit a series of crimes and get elected anyway?\"\n\n\"I hope not. I hope, more optimistically, that equality goes in the direction of men being held to the same standards that women are held to,\" she continued. \"That alongside talent, kindness, respect, and being easy to work with are valued as essential characteristics to getting hired. And that truly bad behavior prevents you from getting another job. And that when the offense is forgivable, when the post-mistake learning is real, people of all genders get the second chance that men currently do.\"", "description": "Natalie Portman said women should make mistakes in a speech for Elle's Women in Hollywood event.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/natalie-portman-gty-aa-191016_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
