But his victims were mostly black, women of color and/or sex workers, not \u201csenators or fancy journalists.\u201d The system allowed him to kill the already-discarded.\n\nIn January 2013, Samuel Little was convicted of murdering three women in Los Angeles during the late 80s. Already before then, he had been in prison and arrested for kidnapping and beating women. In fact, he had already been charged with murder in Mississippi in 1982 where a grand jury failed to indict him. In 1984 in Florida, he was acquitted in another murder case. This seemingly old news, along with other violent crimes he committed, would likely have remained buried were it not for a deal struck last year.\n\nIn exchange for a prison transfer, Little started talking, and he started drawing. He sketched and confessed to killing 93 people, almost all women of color, that he says he murdered between 1970 and 2005 across 16 states. Fast-forward to October 6 of this year, and according to an FBI press release, 50 of his murder confessions have been verified.\n\nAlso on rt.com Worst serial killer? Elderly man in jail for murder confesses to taking 90 lives across the US\n\nBy the FBI\u2019s own admission, Little is \u201cthe most prolific serial killer in U.S. history.\u201d It sounds like quite the accomplishment: \u201cprolific.\u201d Look at how many people he managed to kill \u2013 isn\u2019t that impressive?! Like an artist who amasses a body of work that could fill a museum, the FBI stands in awe of these bodies attributed to Little\u2019s work. The focus is on the monster, not the victims. He earns a pedestaled place at the top of an already long list of horrific serial murderers, but the victims \u2013 they were, and are, disposable.\n\nViCAP Crime Analyst Christie Palazzolo said herself that \u201cFor many years, Samuel Little believed he would not be caught because he thought no one was accounting for his victims.\u201d She says it as if it weren\u2019t true, but isn\u2019t it? If someone were accounting for his victims, wouldn\u2019t he have been held accountable for the crimes he committed back in the early 80s? And is it not also possible that his brief run-ins with our so-called justice system only emboldened him? Looking at his criminal history, most people would come to that very same conclusion: these victims don\u2019t matter. No one is watching. No one is investigating. Quite simply, no one cares. Indeed, even when survivors of his grotesque violence came forward, their lives were literally found to be less valuable than furniture.\n\nFrom 1961-64, Little served time for breaking into a furniture store in Lorain, Ohio. In 1976, Pamela K. Smith escaped from Little\u2019s car where he had \u201cbound, strangled, bitten, beaten and sodomized her.\u201d Although he was charged with rape and assault with great bodily injury, he was only convicted on the lesser charge of assault with attempt to ravish (no really, attempt to ravish is what it\u2019s called). He served three months. Three years for breaking into a furniture store. Three months for kidnapping, assaulting, and raping a woman.\n\nConsidering how survivors of his brutality were treated, it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that many of his victims\u2019 deaths were originally ruled overdoses or attributed to accidental or undetermined causes. It may not surprise us, but it should revolt us. The fact that almost all, if not all of his victims presented as women casts a dark shadow on the value of women in our judicial and social systems. The fact that most of his victims were also women of color and women of color who were sex workers only further highlights the disgusting racist and patriarchal pillars of those systems.\n\nAlso on rt.com From \u2018felon\u2019 to \u2018justice-involved person\u2019: San Francisco fights crime with PC language\n\nIn an interview with journalist Jillian Lauren in 2018, Little described his systemic invisibility cloak when Lauren said that she could have been one of his victims. \u201cI never killed no senators or governors or fancy New York journalists. Nothing like that. I killed you, it\u2019d be all over the news the next day. I stayed in the ghettos.\u201d He knew that the best places to be a monster were in the very same places that the system had been a monster. The very best people to oppress and break were the people whom the system had already oppressed, had already broken.\n\nSergeant Darren Versiga, who arranged an interview with two survivors of Little\u2019s attacks, candidly admitted to these gaping chasms of injustice. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really possible to commit a crime against a black prostitute. It just wasn\u2019t a crime.\u201d\n\nExcept it is a crime. It\u2019s just that the US system, founded on crimes of genocide, slavery, rape, and torture, hasn\u2019t evolved as much as some would like to think. For instance, a 2003 study by the University of Maryland showed that prosecutors are more likely to seek a death sentence when the race of the victim is white, and are less likely to seek a death sentence when the victim is African-American. According to the ACLU, white victims account for approximately one-half of all murder victims, yet 80 percent of all capital cases involve white victims. In other words, if the victims are white, the system is far more likely to care.\n\nMeanwhile, black and indigenous women are far more likely to be murdered than their white counterparts. According to the CDC, black women are killed at a rate of 4.4 per 100,000 people, while white women are killed at a rate of 1.5 per 100,000 people. Despite this disparity, black women are seldom seen as victims. They are seen as somehow deserving of abuse and assault, or even unable to be assaulted entirely. Therefore, they are less likely to be taken seriously if they do report assault.\n\nAlso on rt.com Shootings in America and stabbings in Britain: Two epidemics that are all blame, no solutions\n\nFor instance, in the 2015 case of police officer Daniel Holtzclaw who stalked and raped at least 13 women, he deliberately chose women who were less likely to be believed: black women from impoverished neighborhoods. A survivor of Little\u2019s brutality, Leila McClain, echoed these findings by simply saying, \u201cAin\u2019t nobody cared until that white girl turned up dead a year later. Didn\u2019t nobody care about a black prostitute in Mississippi. No, ma\u2019am, they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhile it is clear that all survivors of rape, all victims of rape and murder are devalued by the system, black women, women of color, non-binary, trans and sex workers are disproportionately devalued. Until we value the lives of women, in particular women of color, trans women, and sex workers, men like this will rape, assault and kill with the impunity awarded them by a flippant system. Little is not prolific. He is horrific. He is grotesque. He is a twisted poster child for a racist patriarchal system. And he should have been removed from society decades ago.\n\nAs a prison abolitionist, I do not advocate for more bodies to be thrown to the prison industrial complex and its torture cages. The need for accountability and separation of serial killers and rapists from society, and the call to abolish prisons are not mutually exclusive demands. Rather, they are two parallel tracks of a system built on believing survivors, anti-racism, feminism, and the valuing of life.\n\nIn order to build that system, we must work to keep the stories and truths of the most marginalized out of the shadows where monsters like Little and the system abuse with impunity. We must not pedestal the abusers or treat their crimes like impressive accomplishments. We must do more than see survivors and victims as statistics, or that\u2019s all they will ever be.\n\nBy Eleanor Goldfield\n\nEleanor Goldfield is a creative activist and journalist.
