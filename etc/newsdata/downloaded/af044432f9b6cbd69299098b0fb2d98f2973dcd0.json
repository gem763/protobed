The second season has already got off to a quick start, with Meryl Streep added to to the cast.\n\nThe Monterey of the show is quite different from the one in real life \u2013 which is full of tourists and old people \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t go. Located on California\u2019s glorious Central Coast, it sits between Los Angeles and San Francisco at one end of the Big Sur. Monterey Bay is an ideal stop if travelling between the two major cities on a road trip or, if you\u2019re not a fan of travelling by car, Amtrak also offers a bus service.\n\nIt\u2019s a city but, with a population of just under 29,000, it still has that small-town feel. The main street, Cannery Row, is quite different from what you picture on the show \u2013 it\u2019s chocca full of visitors. Like with any other seaside town that thrives on those coming from afar, it\u2019s lined with shops selling beachwear, T-shirts from the local area and other miscellaneous items with \u201cMonterey\u201d scrawled across them.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut get away from the main drag and you\u2019ll catch a glimpse of the Monterey from the show. There are stores selling ethnically made products, organic fruit shops and all the places you see Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman et al frequenting.\n\nHere are the places on the Big Little Lies itinerary.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Aesthetically, it suits television \u2013 glass display cases span several floors making it idyllic for shots of conversations.\n\nThe aquarium is full of kids running around on school trips, furiously going through tasks in their workbooks. Throughout the day you can be there for feeding times while simultaneously learning how rescued animals came to live there.\n\nFor those interested in sustainability, the aquarium also has Seafood Watch \u2013 a globally recognised programme that encourages sustainable eating. Many local restaurants have signed up, but its reach is worldwide.\n\nHyatt Carmel Highlands\n\nCeleste has got one of the best views from her home hands down, but the indoor shots are actually filmed in a studio space.\n\nThe views, however, are real and can be enjoyed from the comfort of the Hyatt hotel located just outside of Carmel. The hotel is on the pricier side (those views are prime real estate) with bed and breakfast starting at $430. You can take it all in for a fraction of the price if you book brunch \u2013 dishes start at under $10.\n\nThe restaurant is also a partner in the Seafood Watch programme, so you\u2019ll also be eating sustainably.\n\nBixby Creek Bridge\n\nYou\u2019ll recognise this from the opening credits \u2013 the bridge and the surrounding areas feature heavily on any car journey filmed.\n\nThese scenes are from one of the most famous stretches of road in the world: the Pacific Coast Highway, which runs along the Californian coast. If you\u2019re there at the right time of year, you\u2019ll stumble across an elephant seal colony (just be prepared for the smell).\n\nLovers Point Park\n\nA couple of miles away from the centre of Monterey lies Lovers Point Park, which is the setting for the Blissful Drip coffee shop in the new season. It\u2019s also been used for various other shots in both seasons and it\u2019s an idyllic place to watch the sun go down.\n\nBeach House Restaurant & Bar sits looking along the beach with incredible views of the sunset (it\u2019s got many window and patio tables). Those feeling more active can go snorkelling and scuba diving.\n\nDel Monte Beach\n\nIn the show, Jane is often seeing running on the dunes of Del Monte Beach.\n\nSome of the most iconic scenes from the show incorporate this Monterey stretch of sand, but if running isn\u2019t your jam, you can walk along some of the hiking trails.\n\nOld Fisherman\u2019s Wharf\n\nIn central Monterey, the Old Fisherman\u2019s Wharf is exactly what you\u2019d picture Monterey to be. Paluca Trattoria is a family-owned Italian restaurant on the wharf that was an inspiration for the Blue Blues caf\u00e9 that the characters frequent (while making you oh so jealous of their lifestyle).\n\nThe show didn\u2019t film in Paluca Trattoria itself, but instead recreated the outdoor set (based on the real thing) in a Hollywood studio. They used a green screen of the backdrop of the wharf because if there\u2019s a view like that, it needs to be used.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nBritish Airways flies from London to San Jos\u00e9 for around \u00a3300 return. From there it\u2019s 75 miles to Monterey.\n\nFor getting around, Uber and Lyft are good options, but if you really want to see it all, hire a car.", "description": "The first season of Big Little Lies had us all hooked: we were obsessed with the lives of the uber-wealthy\u00a0women of Monterey, not to mention the sweeping beaches, dramatic drives and cutesy coastal coffee shops.\u00a0The second season has already got off to a quick start,\u00a0with Meryl Streep added to\u00a0to the cast.", "authors": ["Sarah Arnold"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/03/19/istock-686475586.jpg"}
