Gains in Shanghai\u2019s Composite remained timid.\n\nSovereign bonds sold off across all continents. The US 10-year yield advanced past 1.67%.\n\nRegardless of the present optimism, it is important to keep our feet on the ground. Positive news does not necessarily mean that China would get away with more tariffs on its US exports as scheduled for next week unless both parties explicitly state the contrary.\n\nPound jumps on Brexit optimism. How solid are recent gains?\n\nYields in the United Kingdom jumped the most after Boris Johnson and Irish Premier Varadkar said in a joint statement that they saw a \u2018pathway\u2019 to a possible Brexit deal. The 10-year gilt yield rose 12.7 points, as the pound jumped to a two-week high against the US dollar, despite a meaningful decline in Britain\u2019s industrial and manufacturing production in August.\n\nCable cleared the 100-day moving average (1.2410) and advanced to 1.2469. But offers remain dominant near the 1.25 handle on lingering uncertainties about what to do with the tricky Irish border.\n\nThe euro threw itself above the 1.10 barrier against the US dollar and saw distinct support at this level in the overnight trading session.\n\nThe euro-pound plunged to 0.8830 from 0.9020.\n\nBut, how exactly the leaders plan to solve the Irish customs puzzle remains blurry. Boris Johnson proposed limiting custom checks away from the Northern Ireland border, while Varadkar responded that any custom checks inside Ireland would threaten the peace within his country. Dismissing custom inspections in Ireland would mean that goods could be smuggled from the UK to the EU and vice versa. One possible solution to avoid that would be leaving Northern Ireland out of the UK\u2019s custom zone. But this would see a solid resistance from many policymakers, especially from Democratic Unionists.\n\nWe do not want to be a wet blanket, but the optimism over yesterday\u2019s statement could rapidly fade if the European leaders don\u2019t adhere to what Irish Times called a \u2018very significant movement\u2019 on the Irish border enigma. Today\u2019s meeting between Brexit Secretary Barclay and EU\u2019s chief negotiator Barnier should throw some light on whether the recent Brexit optimism has solid funding, or it was just a flash in the pan.\n\nThe two-week risk reversals in pound-dollar, which show the call option premiums over put option premiums spiked to the highest on Bloomberg\u2019s record since 2005, as traders increased upside hedges on a heavily and negatively skewed pound market.\n\nAlas, British blue chips will likely feel the pinch of a relatively expensive pound at today\u2019s open.\n\nThe is set for a negative open on the back of a strong pound, but the eyes a move above 12200 in Frankfurt, given that an eventual trade deal between the US and China, and a reasonable Brexit agreement could improve the investor mood in German stock markets.\n\nOpening calls\n\nto open 22 points lower at 7164\n\nto open 44 points higher at 12208\n\nDisclaimer: The information and comments provided herein under no circumstances are to be considered an offer or solicitation to invest and nothing herein should be construed as investment advice.
