Backlund fired a shot that beat Ducks goalie John Gibson to the glove side for his second goal of the season.\n\nCalgary's Michael Stone had tied the game 1-1 with a goal late in the second period.\n\nJakob Silfverberg scored the lone goal for the Ducks, who fell to 4-1-0 at home and lost for just the third time in nine games to start the schedule.\n\nThe Flames pulled off the victory on their second game in consecutive nights after falling 4-1 to the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday night. The Flames went 1-1-0 on a brief Southern California road trip and now return home, where they are 3-0-1.\n\nGoalie Cam Talbot made 29 saves for Calgary, including a pads stop off a blistering shot from the Ducks' Nick Ritchie with six minutes remaining while sliding to his left. Talbot stopped one last Ritchie shot from just in front of the goal with 11 seconds remaining.\n\nIt was just the second road victory in six tries for the Flames. Calgary won at Anaheim for just the second time in its past 28 games going back to the 2005-06 season. It was just the 10th victory for the Flames in 55 all-time tries in the Ducks' building.\n\nAfter a scoreless first period, Silfverberg gave the Ducks a 1-0 lead just 12 seconds into the second, when he took Hampus Lindholm's pass from the slot and fired a shot from inside the left circle and just inside the near post. Silfverberg, who has five goals on the season, scored in his third consecutive game.\n\nThe Flames pulled even at 15:32 of the middle period on a one-timer by Stone, his first of the season, from near the blue line. The puck slid just inside the left post and past Gibson, who was screened by traffic in front of the goal.\n\nGibson finished with 27 saves.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Mikael Backlund scored with just over 11 minutes remaining as the Calgary  Flames rallied for a 2-1 victory over the Ducks on Saturday, handing Anaheim  its...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
