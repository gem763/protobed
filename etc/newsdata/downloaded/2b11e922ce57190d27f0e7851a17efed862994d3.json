But that\u2019s not cinema. Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well-made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.\"\n\nMARVEL PHASE FOUR: 'ETERNALS,' 'DR. STRANGE' SEQUEL, NATALIE PORTMAN AS THOR, 'BLADE' REBOOT ANNOUNCED\n\n\"It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being,\" he added.\n\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy\" director James Gunn responded on Twitter to the comment.\n\nDISNEY TEASES 'STAR WARS,' 'ETERNALS,' 'FROZEN 2' AND MORE AT D23 CONVENTION\n\n\u201cMartin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers. I was outraged when people picketed \u2018The Last Temptation of Christ\u2019 without having seen the film. I\u2019m saddened that he\u2019s now judging mine in the same way,\u201d he said on Friday.\n\nThe president of Marvel Studios, Kevin Feige, previously responded to critics who pointed out that the fantasy films don't get much award-season love.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s easy to dismiss VFX or flying people or spaceships or billion-dollar grosses,\u201d Feige said (via The Guardian). \u201cI think it is easy to say that you have already been awarded in a certain way. Hitchcock never won best director, so it\u2019s very nice, but it doesn\u2019t mean everything.\n\n\"I would much rather be in a room full of engaged fans.\u201d\n\n'SPIDER-MAN' RETURNING TO MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE, STAR TOM HOLLAND CELEBRATES\n\nFans offered their own defense of the MCU on social media.\n\n\"Why do people care what Martin #Scorsese thinks about Iron Man? If you like the MCU movies, then like the MCU movies,\" one user wrote.\n\nAnother said, \"I honestly wonder how many of Scorsese's films you've actually seen.\"\n\n\"Someone needs to tell Marty Scorsese that the MCU is the only reason theaters are still in business,\" came still another response.\n\n\"He's being an elitist gatekeeper a--hole (which is ironic because comic book nerds often are too) but he's entitled to his opinion. he's not jealous, he's just wrong, and even the most genius and enlightened among us are wrong sometimes,\" someone else declared.\n\n'AVENGERS: ENDGAME' LEAVES BOX OFFICE RECORDS IN THE DUST\n\n\"Avengers: Endgame\" became the highest-grossing film in history this past summer, taking in more than $2.8 billion at the global box office.\n\nScorsese is known for such films as \"The Departed,\" \"Taxi Driver,\" \"Casino\" and \"Goodfellas.\"", "description": "Marvel Cinematic Universe fans aren't happy with famed\u00a0director Martin Scorsese.", "authors": ["Jessica Napoli"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/rtx2xpy4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
