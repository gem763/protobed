We know Ronan Farrow also had those documents and the whistleblower's story. We know the Times didn't publish a story until after the New Yorker did. We know Ito was on the board of the Times. We know there's no public editor. https://t.co/PRlCwQkj3z \u2014 Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) September 7, 2019\n\nAnd now for his \u201cupdate\u201d because he was totally wrong in that first tweet that went viral:\n\nUpdate: Whistleblower Aid, the organization representing former MIT Media Lab employee Signe Swenson, told me today that they provided emails and documents to the New York Times only after the publication of Ronan Farrow's story by the New Yorker. cc @xeni @pilhofer \u2014 Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) September 8, 2019\n\nProfessor Rosen, you spelled \u201ccorrection\u201d incorrectly:\n\nUpdate? How about \"Correction?\" Or, I dunno, an apology for the clear implication that the NYT withheld information from readers to protect its board member? You tweet an accusation that gets thousands of likes and retweets, and the weak \"never mind\" gets slipped quietly in. https://t.co/puBwKI8Fwf \u2014 John Schwartz (@jswatz) September 8, 2019\n\nAnd that\u2019s how NOT TO DO journalism.\n\n***", "description": "\"Update?
