From there, it engulfed the whole tower, reducing it to a charred ruin by morning.\n\nMoore-Bick said there was compelling evidence that the external walls did not comply with building regulations. The cladding and accompanying insulation material were combustible, and there were vertical cavities that acted as chimneys for the fire to rise.\n\n\"They (the external walls) did not adequately resist the spread of fire having regard to the height, use and position of the building. On the contrary, they actively promoted it,\" he wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPOSSIBLE CONDITIONS\n\nHe did not apportion blame for the decision to use the materials in the refurbishment, but said the issue would be at the heart of the second phase of his inquiry, which is already under way and is expected to last about two years.\n\nA criminal investigation into the Grenfell Tower disaster is also ongoing, although police have said no decision on charges will be made until the public inquiry process has concluded.\n\nThe Phase 1 report heavily criticized the London Fire Brigade, saying that preparations and training for an event like the Grenfell fire were inadequate and that poor decisions were made on the night.\n\nThe head of the brigade, Dany Cotton, called for far-reaching reforms to building and fire safety regulations at the national level.\n\n\"It was an unprecedented residential building fire, precipitated by significant failings of the building\u2019s fire safety measures which created impossible conditions that residents and the emergency services must never be placed in again,\" Cotton said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMUNITY FELT IGNORED\n\nLocated in the wealthy area of Kensington, Grenfell Tower was home to a close-knit community that traced its roots to places as diverse as Britain, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Morocco, Gambia, Ethiopia, Italy and Trinidad.\n\nThe report paid tribute to the 71 people who died on the night \u2013 70 adults and children who were unable to escape the tower, and one baby who was delivered stillborn after his eight-month-pregnant mother was evacuated through toxic fumes.\n\nCritics have accused the Kensington local authority of neglecting the tower because of indifference towards its low-income, immigrant residents - prompting a wider public debate about Britain's yawning rich-poor divide and class prejudice among officials.\n\nMoore-Bick alluded to this context in his report, saying that the second phase of the inquiry would examine the issue of why warnings by the local community before the fire that Grenfell Tower was unsafe were ignored.\n\n\"There is a strong feeling among them that their voices were ignored and that if attention had been paid to them the disaster could have been avoided,\u201d he wrote.\n\n(Editing by Stephen Addison)", "description": "Combustible materials used to refurbish London's Grenfell Tower were central to the catastrophic chain of events in June 2017 that turned an ordinary kitchen fire into an inferno that killed 71 people, an official inquiry said on Wednesday.
