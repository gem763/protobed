Appallingly, some onlookers even clapped their hands to incite the rioters,\" the police said. Late on Monday most police had withdrawn from Mong Kok streets.\n\nFour months of protests have plunged the former British colony into its worst political crisis in decades and pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nHundreds of protesters gathered in Hong Kong shopping malls during the day demanding \"freedom\", but street protests failed to materialise in any significant size as the city struggled to recover from violent clashes in recent days.\n\nTens of thousands of protesters, many families with children, marched peacefully through the centre of Hong Kong on Sunday, most wearing face masks in defiance of the threat of a maximum one-year prison sentence for doing so. Those rallies later descended into violent clashes with police.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONS TORCHED\n\nThe introduction of colonial-era emergency powers banning face masks, which protesters use to hide their identity, has sparked some of the most violent clashes in four months of demonstrations.\n\n\"Before long, unless we are very, very lucky, people are going to get killed, people are going to be shot,\" former British governor Chris Patten told Sky News.\n\n\"The idea that with public order policing you send police forces out with live ammunition is preposterous,\" said Patten, who presided over the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997.\n\nTwo protesters have been shot, one in the chest and one in the leg. Authorities said the shootings were not intentional but occurred during skirmishes between police and protesters.\n\nMany protesters, police and journalists have been injured in clashes, with police using rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons against demonstrators, some of whom throw bricks and petrol bombs.\n\nOn Monday, Hong Kong's metro rail system, which typically carries about 5 million passengers a day, was only partially operating after what authorities said was \"serious vandalism\" on Sunday night. Some stations were torched in the protests.\n\nMany shops and Chinese banks were also extensively damaged.\n\nAbout one-tenth of ATMs were vandalised and cash refills may be delayed in some areas due to public events or security concerns, said the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).\n\nThe Sunday night protests, the second night of violence since the imposition of emergency laws, saw scores of protesters arrested and the first warning from Chinese military personnel stationed in the territory.\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERNET RESTRICTIONS?\n\nWhat started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has grown into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing's increasing grip on the city, which protesters say undermines a \"one country, two systems\" status promised when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule.", "description": "Hong Kong police staged a show of force on Monday night in a district hit by some of the most violent clashes with protesters in recent months, but instead of being confronted by demonstrators were jeered by onlookers.
