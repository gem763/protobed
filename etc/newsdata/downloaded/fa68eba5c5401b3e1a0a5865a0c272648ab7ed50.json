But none of the mysterious Q\u2019s predictions in anonymous internet forums had come to pass nearly a year after it started in October 2017, and QAnon believers were starting to lose faith. After yet another Q prediction failed to materialize in 2018, an armed, crazed QAnon fan allegedly shut down a bridge near the Hoover Dam with an improvised armored truck.\n\nThe Welches decided they needed some way to show how many Trump supporters believed in the mega-conspiracy theory, which has pulled in Pizzagate and a wide range of other conspiracy theories. They printed up T-shirts and signs that said \u201cWe Are Q\u201d and passed them out at a Trump rally in Tampa, Florida.\n\n\u201cWe took \u2019em to the rally and handed \u2019em out, and the rest is history,\u201d Lisa Welch told a crowd of roughly 100 QAnon believers who gathered to rally across the street from the White House on Wednesday.\n\nThe Welches\u2019 signs and T-shirts, along with other QAnon-related signs and \u201cQ\u201d cut-outs, were unavoidable in cable news coverage of the rally. Suddenly, people all over the country were asking what why a segment of Trump fans adored the letter Q, and QAnon believers were invigorated.\n\n\u201cBy the time the rally was over, they didn\u2019t have any choice but to put us on [TV],\u201d said John Welch.\n\nThe Tampa rally wasn\u2019t the first time QAnon believers had appeared among Trump\u2019s faithful, but it did show QAnon fans that showing up to the rallies with Q signs and clothes could have a real world effect.\n\nNow QAnon believers eager to appear at Trump rallies are posing a challenge to the president\u2019s reelection. As Trump faces a tough campaign, some of his most visible supporters come from QAnon-world, where various factions include 9/11 Truthers, anti-Semites, and people who think John F. Kennedy Jr. is still alive and will soon return to arrest Democrats.\n\nBut to QAnon supporters, Trump rallies are a great chance both to see the president and to get their message out without going through a media they claim is biased against them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Trump tweeting,\u201d said Pennsylvania contractor Daniel Graham, who drove to Washington for Wednesday\u2019s rally.\n\nTo Team Trump, though, QAnon diehards who adore Trump and garner media coverage and camera shots at his 2020 rallies have been a longtime nuisance. One current senior Trump campaign official told The Daily Beast that the standard operating procedure among most staff has been to generally just \u201cignore them\u201d and not \u201cmake a big deal out of\u201d them, both to deprive them of as much press attention as possible and to avoid \u201cpissing off the crazy\u201d people.\n\nIn a particularly weird bit of Trumpworld drama that unfolded earlier this year, QAnon believers turned on and began targeting former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka after he called their beliefs \u201cGARBAGE.\u201d Since the Tampa rally, Gorka and other Trump allies have struggled to stop QAnon\u2019s spread, on the grounds that it\u2019s an embarrassment to the larger Trump coalition.\n\nAnd over the past year, more and more QAnon fans who also support Trump have alleged that their Q gear and shirts have been banned from the president\u2019s rallies, and they have accused security personnel of instructing them to, for instance, turn their T-shirts inside out. The U.S. Secret Service, for its part, has publicly denied that it is involved in QAnon suppression at Trump rallies. If QAnon-related clothing and signs are banned, it\u2019s possible that the ban has been imposed by additional, hired security guards, rather than the Secret Service.\n\nThe Welches began to appear at other Trump rallies with more QAnon merch, despite being harried by what John Welch described as Secret Service agents. After a security guard tried to stop him from handing out Q koozies, he claims he just threw them out to the crowd \u201clike a rock star.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to comment on these matters, the Trump team hinted at its justifications, though typically while going out of its way not to mention the term \u201cQAnon.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo non-Trump-related political messaging is permitted inside the venue. We do our best to ensure this rule is fully enforced,\u201d Michael Glassner, chief operating officer of the 2020 Trump campaign, said in a brief statement.\n\nTechnically, QAnon is Trump-related political messaging, brought to a wacky, sometimes violent, and extremely online fringe. It\u2019s Trump-related enough that some of the conspiracy theory\u2019s top proponents have sought White House meetings with this president. Several have been successful.\n\nLast year, a grinning Trump somehow ended up posing for an Oval Office photo op with YouTube conspiracy theorist Lionel Lebron, one of the leading promoters of the QAnon theory. In July, Trump invited several QAnon promoters to his White House Social Media Summit, where he praised the QAnon pushers and other \u201cmemesmiths\u201d for their work on his behalf.\n\nBut while a White House visit serves as the ultimate sign of Trump\u2019s approval for QAnon\u2019s top echelon, the rallies are the only place where most Q believers get a chance to see the man they believe is about to topple a global cannibal conspiracy.\n\nQ believers have resorted to unorthodox craft methods to get around the apparent ban on QAnon gear at Trump rallies. Sometimes, they cover QAnon shirts with another shirt to get through security, then remove the decoy shirt once the rally starts. In August, a Trump campaign ad featured, apparently accidentally, multiple sanctioned campaign signs that had been doctored with tape and markers to show \u201cQ\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAnd sometimes, the QAnon message actually comes from a speaker at the rally.\n\nAt an August event in Cincinnati, Brandon Straka, who\u2019s become a personality on the right after founding the \u201c#Walkaway\u201d movement urging traditionally Democratic constituencies to leave the party, used his warm-up spot at the rally to tell the crowd \u201cWhere we go one, we go all.\u201d That phrase is the most prominent QAnon slogan, and QAnon supporters cheered when Straka used it from the stage. Straka later insisted he didn\u2019t mean to imply any QAnon connection.\n\nThe presence of Q believers at rallies also means Trump could accidentally endorse the theory, at least in the eyes of its believers. Nearly every Trump appearance produces footage that QAnon believers scrutinize in hopes of seeing Trump\u2019s hand movements form what they believe to be a \u201cQ.\u201d\n\nBut at a July rally in Greenville, North Carolina, Trump called a baby wearing a QAnon symbol on the back of its onesie \u201cbeautiful.\u201d The onesie appeared to have been altered, with a marker line added to make the printed \u201cO\u201d design into a \u201cQ.\u201d\n\nQAnon believers were thrilled by what they saw as Trump\u2019s confirmation, via the baby, that the theory was real. The child was soon dubbed \u201cQ Baby,\u201d and her parents\u2014North Carolina Trump supporter Roman Riselvato and his girlfriend\u2014made an Etsy page to sell clothing with a design similar to the onesie after requests from Q fans.\n\nRiselvato told The Daily Beast that, should he get the opportunity to go to another Trump rally, he\u2019d definitely bring more Q-related signs or clothing to get QAnon\u2019s message out to other potential recruits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a necessity to know that you\u2019re not alone,\u201d Riselvato said.", "description": "They love the president, and appear at Trump rallies in their favorite merch.
