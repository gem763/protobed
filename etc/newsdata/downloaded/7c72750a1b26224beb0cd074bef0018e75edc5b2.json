So, based on the most recent polling, here are four of those myths \u2013 busted.\n\nMyth one: \u201cVoters are so fed up with the whole process that they just want to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nThe slogan \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d dominated the set at last week\u2019s Conservative Party conference. But however fed up voters feel, most think that the right outcome \u2013 their preferred form of Brexit, or staying in the European Union after all \u2013 matters more than a quick resolution.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

But among the minority, more Leave than Remain voters are having second thoughts.\n\nFigures in individual polls vary slightly, but an average of recent surveys shows a steady 53-47 per cent preference for Remain. This represents a five-point swing to Remain since 2016. Few general elections produce bigger swings than this.\n\nShifts away from Leave are greatest among working class voters under 50, NHS nurses and mothers of young children \u2013 voters attracted three years ago by hopes of higher-paid jobs and better-funded public services, but who now fear the impact of Brexit on both.\n\nYouGov surveys show that while Conservatives who voted Leave in 2016 are still solidly behind Brexit, more than one in four Labour-supporting Leave voters now either back Remain or don\u2019t know how they would vote.\n\nMyth three: \u201cIf voters were persuaded in a new referendum to vote the same way as last time, Leave would win once again.\u201d\n\nThis the assumption underlying the unofficial slogan, \u201ctell them again\u201d. Its truth seems obvious \u2013 but in fact, it\u2019s not the case.\n\nTwo and a half million teenagers have reached voting age since 2016. Although turnout in this age group tends to be low, those that would vote are overwhelmingly in favour of wanting Britain to stay in the EU.\n\nOver the same period, two million Britons have died. Older voters divided two-to-one in favour of Brexit in 2016.\n\nTaking these two demographic factors together, and allowing for turnout differences, a referendum today would result in 600-700,000 more Remain voters and 800-900,000 fewer Leave voters \u2013 even if not a single person changed their mind. As the Leave majority three years ago was just under 1.3 million, this means that a referendum today would produce a Remain majority on demographic factors alone.\n\nMyth four: \u201cVoters don\u2019t want another referendum.\u201d\n\nBrenda from Bristol\u2019s reaction to the start of the 2017 general election \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re joking, not another one\u201d \u2013 is widely thought to reflect majority views on a fresh referendum. It doesn\u2019t.\n\nOne way or another, the final decision about Brexit must be taken by either MPs or the wider electorate. The latest YouGov survey finds that, by almost two-to-one, voters say that if Britain is to leave the EU without a deal, the decision should be taken by a referendum than by parliament. If a deal is agreed with Brussels, the margin widens to more than two-to-one.", "description": "The loudest voices on all sides of the Brexit debate have two things in common: they all seem convinced that they know what the public thinks, and they all believe that their supporters are in the majority.
