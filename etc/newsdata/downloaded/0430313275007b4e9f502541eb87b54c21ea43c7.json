It\u2019s one of several patches out in the ocean causing significant harm to marine life as it continues to grow.\n\nBut the 600m-long device, created by Dutch scientists, has managed to successfully capture larger pieces of debris and small microplastics for the first time.\n\n\u2018After beginning this journey seven years ago, this first year of testing in the unforgivable environment of the high seas strongly indicates that our vision is attainable and that the beginning of our mission to rid the ocean of plastic garbage, which has accumulated for decades, is within our sights,\u2019 said Boyan Slat, the founder of the not-for-profit Ocean Cleanup Foundation that created the device.\n\nOur ocean cleanup system is now finally catching plastic, from one-ton ghost nets to tiny microplastics!

He added waste larger than this can quickly become toxic and harm wildlife.\n\nThe Ocean Cleanup Foundation said: \u2018During the period where System 001 is the only active cleanup system, we project 50 tons of plastic to be extracted per year.\n\n\u2018The full fleet of systems is projected to extract up to 14,000 tons of plastic per year. We estimate to be able to remove 50 per cent of the plastic circulating in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch every five years.\u2019", "description": "The floating pile of plastic waste is three times the size of France", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88783629_1570439505.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
