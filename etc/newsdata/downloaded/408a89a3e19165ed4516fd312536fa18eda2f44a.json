Coming to Netflix Nov. 1", "language": "en", "text": "The U.S. got Marie Kondo\u2019ed. Now, it\u2019s time for Japan to get Queer Eye\u2019ed. Arigato, Netflix!\n\nBy Victoria Vlisides Oct 4, 2019 5 min read\n\nNetflix recently dropped the teaser to the new Queer Eye: We\u2019re in Japan! special that will debut across the streaming platform on Nov. 1.\n\nThough we\u2019re still a month out, this is huge news for Queer Eye fans who have been anticipating its release since January when the cast of Queer Eye, aka the Fab Five, were spotted all over Tokyo.\n\nThe new four-episode special follows Antoni Porowski, Bobby Berk, Jonathan Van Ness, Tan France, and Karamo Brown as they bring their message of self-care and compassion to four Japanese men and women while exploring Japan\u2019s culture and cuisine.\n\nIn case you\u2019ve been living under a rock, the Emmy-Award-winning Queer Eye is a reboot show in its fourth season. Netflix Japan didn\u2019t launch until September 2015, but since early 2018, more than 16.5 percent of Japanese residents use the streaming service, according to an article on Japan Today.\n\nHere\u2019s everything you should know before viewing the sure-to-be iconic episodes. Yassssssss!!!\n\n1. Kiko Mizuhara and Naomi Watanabe get in on the fun\n\nSubstantive self-care is definitely something the hard-working people of Japan could benefit from. QE seems to have done a good job including Japanese pop culture icons in addition to the people the Fab Five will be helping, called \u201cheroes.\u201d The episodes will include appearances from actress and model Kiko Mizuhara, and comedian and fashion designer Naomi Watanabe.\n\nDavid Collins, creator and executive producer of Queer Eye, said in a press release that they knew they needed \u201clocal tastemakers\u201d to help guide the Fab Five to understand the unique traditions, customs, and trends while filming in Japan. (They filmed the episodes in January 2019.)\n\nMizuhara was one of the talents they were thrilled to be adding to the team.\n\n\u201cShe not only understands the show but also has her finger on the pulse of all things culturally relevant in Japan,\u201d Collins said.\n\nMizuhara\u2019s appearance isn\u2019t without controversy in Japan though as she\u2019s recently come under fire for a photoshoot that some claimed was disrespectful to Japanese culture.\n\n2. The Japanese teaser is way better than the English one\n\nThe teaser posted on Netflix\u2019s Instagram in early September shows Mizuhara chatting up the boys, telling them to come over to Tokyo. Of course, they said, \u201cYassss!\u201d\n\nA more revealing teaser video was posted on the NetflixJP Instagram that offers a much better idea of what the special episodes will hold, with previews of the boys and Mizuhara walking the Shibuya Scramble and working with the \u201cheroes\u201d in their homes. (The highlight has to be France peeking out from a sliding shoji paper door and speaking Japanese with a rather spot-on inflection: Junbi wa dou?!)\n\n3. Self-love will continue to be a big part of the Japan episodes\n\nFrom what we can tell so far, self-acceptance will be as big a part of the Japan-based show as it is in the U.S.-based version.\n\nThe QE cast works with men and women who identify as both queer and straight. In a Netflix press release, Mizuhara said she was excited to show the boys around, admitting, \u201cour cultures are so different\u201d and that it may be challenging for the four \u201cheroes\u201d to feel comfortable being \u201copen\u201d in Japan.\n\nPhoto: Netflix QE\u2019s Tan France and Antoni Porowski in Season 4.\n\nThe Japanese trailer did give a sneak peek at the Japanese heroes on the show, and one man in the trailer says he doesn\u2019t feel like his home is really his, while another middle-aged woman said she hadn\u2019t taken a bath in three days\u2014but that you can\u2019t die from that. Looks like the Fab Five are needed more than ever.\n\nIt is still unclear as to why the Fab Five picked Japan out of anywhere in the world to do QE. (Or, more likely, why the producers chose it.) We contacted the Queer Eye: We\u2019re in Japan! associate producer Erin McKeon for comment, but she said she couldn\u2019t comment on it before the show airs.\n\n4. Queer Eye: We\u2019re in Japan! may help LGBT awareness grow in Japan\n\nQueer Eye: We\u2019re in Japan! comes at a time when LGBT awareness is at the highest it\u2019s ever been (on record) in Japan. More than two-thirds of 60,000 respondents to an online survey ran by PR firm Dentsu Inc. were familiar with the acronym LGBT. That\u2019s compared to just over 37 percent in 2015.\n\nHowever, this awareness doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to a deeper level of understanding of LGBT issues, which would also contribute to fighting biases and stereotypes. It\u2019s still quite uncommon for LGBT Japanese people to be openly \u201cout.\u201d In fact, about 65 percent of LGBT respondents of the same survey said they had not told anyone about their sexuality and remain in the closet.\n\nTokyo Pride celebrated its 25th anniversary this year.\n\n5. Queer Eye will contribute to queer representation in media in Japan\n\nNot only are queer topics not often talked about but queer representation in mainstream media is also close to none. Although one recent example of representation is Shunsuke from Netflix\u2019s reality show Terrace House coming out as bisexual, the QE show is considered to be more widely watched among Western viewers rather than mainstream Japanese viewers.\n\nAlex Rickert, a queer culture writer for GaijinPot, said Queer Eye coming to Japan has potential positives and negatives in terms of gay representation in Japanese media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there are plenty of gay celebrities in Japanese pop culture, but most of them stay pretty silent about their sexuality,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nRickert said that mainstream representation of gay characters in Japanese media\u2014excluding anime and manga\u2014\u201cgenerally consists of drag queens\u201d such as Matsuko Deluxe.\n\n\u201cHe (or she, in drag) represents a very spectacular version of homosexuality that doesn\u2019t resonate with the lived experiences of most Japanese gay men,\u201d he said.\n\nHe is hoping that Queer Eye: We\u2019re in Japan! will offer viewers a deeper look into queer culture in Japan instead of potentially reinforcing the attitude that the LGBTQ movement is more of a \u201cwestern import\u201d to Japan, rather than coming from Japan itself.\n\nWith that said, we\u2019re definitely hoping Queer Eye: We\u2019re in Japan! will be, at the very least, a conversation starter where there wasn\u2019t much of one before.\n\nNetflix\u2019s original series Queer Eye: We\u2019re in Japan! will be available on Netflix worldwide on Nov. 1.", "description": "", "authors": ["Victoria Vlisides", "Gaijinpot Blog", "Brooke Larsen", "Limarc Ambalina"], "top_image": "https://gaijinpot.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2019/10/Queer-Eye-Production-Still-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
