The Nazi items include busts of Adolf Hitler, an instrument to measure people\u2019s heads to supposedly determine their racial purity and statues of the Nazi eagle with a swastika under its talons.\n\nOwning Nazi objects in Argentina can be illegal if it is determined that the items incite racial or religious hate in public, although they can be allowed in private. It has not been determined if the collector violated the anti-discrimination law, although he has been charged with owning pieces of illegal origin.\n\nAgents with Interpol began following the collector and with a judicial order raided the house on June 8, 2017. A large bookshelf caught their attention and behind it agents found a hidden passageway to a room filled with Nazi imagery.\n\nArgentine and German experts say most of the objects are original. They also include toys that authorities have said would have been used to indoctrinate children, a Nazi hourglass and a box of swastika-emblazoned harmonicas. The collection also includes a photo negative of Hitler holding a magnifying glass similar to those found in the boxes.\n\nThe main hypothesis among investigators and members of Argentina\u2019s Jewish community is that the items were brought in by Nazis after World War II, when the South American country became a refuge for some of the most infamous war criminals.\n\nThe objects will remain in custody at the Museum of the Holocaust while the investigation continues.\n\nThe museum\u2019s president, Marcelo Mindlin, said Wednesday that the items encouraged \u201chate, death and destruction.\u201d He said they will become part of an exhibit \u201cin the service of transmitting democratic values, education and the fight for memory so tragedies like the Holocaust are not repeated.\u201d", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
