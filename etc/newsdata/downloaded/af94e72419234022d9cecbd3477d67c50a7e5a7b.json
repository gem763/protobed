His brother Bradley heard what happened and summoned help at their home in Wigan.\n\nWhen paramedics found him seven minutes later he was struggling to breathe and could not talk so he was taken to hospital and put into an induced coma for four days.\n\nDoctors at Salford Royal Hospital found Harvey had suffered two mini-strokes and a spinal stroke that resulted in injury to his vertebrae.\n\nHarvey was put into a coma for four days after being admitted to Salford Royal Hospital (Picture: Mercury Press)\n\nHarvey, left, pictured with brother Bradley, right, who discovered him having a seizure in his bedroom (Picture: Mercury Press)\n\nHis mother Angela, 57, said: \u2018I was out at the time it happened, I remember getting a call from my partner who told me to come home.\n\nPeadophile Jeffrey Epstein 'had 13 contact numbers for Prince Andrew'\n\n\u2018As soon as I learned what happened I rushed to the hospital. When I arrived I collapsed in the corridor, I couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. My mind was racing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I still feel like I\u2019m in limbo. To see your child go from running around and being active to this is heart breaking.\u2019\n\nHarvey had to be fed through a tube for the first couple of weeks and was initially unable to speak.\n\nAngela said: \u2018I remember the first time he spoke to us after the accident. Nurses removed his tube and he said hello to the whole family. I broke down in tears of joy.\n\nHarvey\u2019s family are now raising money to adapt their house so that Harvey can come home (Picture: Mercury)\n\n\u2018I thought he would start improving in other areas too, that everything would go back to normal. So to be told that he would be paralysed for life was another blow.\u2019\n\nSince the accident there has been little improvement with his body rejecting a catheter, but every step is seen as great progress.\n\nMan, 38, killed himself while waiting for treatment for 'excruciating toothache'\n\nOnly four weeks ago he regained the ability to move his right index finger, but doctors say there are no signals going to the nerves in his legs or on the left side of his body.\n\nHe is now being looked after in Southport where he remains under observation and is receiving physiotherapy.\n\nThe family home has been deemed unsuitable for Harvey to return so the family have started a fundraising page to raise \u00a350,000 for adaptations to be made.\n\nAngela said: \u2018Harvey just wants to come home and I\u2019m desperate to make that happen. I just want my son back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Because of his wheelchair he\u2019d be trapped in his bedroom completely. I can\u2019t let that happen to him. He\u2019s only 17, it\u2019s not fair on him.\u2019\n\nThe funds would be used for a conversion of their garage and to convert the ground floor of their home so that it is open plan to avoid having to send Harvey to a care home.\n\nAngela added: \u2018He\u2019s only 17 and because this kind of injury is rare for someone so young, he\u2019d be in a home with older people.\n\n\u2018He needs people his own age \u2013 he needs his family around him. Knowing that he might not be able to come home is having a negative effect on his mental health.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a mummy\u2019s boy, he\u2019s more like a 14 year old at heart and he just wants to come home. It\u2019s amazing the help we\u2019ve received, but we still have a long way to go.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
