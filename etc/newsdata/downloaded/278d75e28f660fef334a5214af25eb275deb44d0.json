The outcome is better than expected by The Wall Street Journal\u2019s survey of economists, whose consensus was for 9.7 points. GfK uses three sub-indexes for the current month to derive a sentiment figure for the coming month.\n\nWhile the already familiar flashpoints, such as the global economic slowdown, trade conflicts and Brexit discussion are affecting consumers, \u201cthe decision of the European Central Bank to further relax its monetary policy is having an impact on consumers in September,\u201d GfK said.\n\nAmong the sub-indexes, consumers\u2019 economic outlook and the propensity to buy have risen, but their income expectations have declined, GfK said.\n\nThe better-than-expected German consumer sentiment follows a stronger-than-expected improvement in Ifo business climate data which were released Tuesday. However, the companies\u2019 expectations component of the Ifo survey fell to a decade-low. Economists interpreted the September Ifo survey as one bringing some relief, but still leaving it likely that Germany entered a recession in the third quarter.\n\nGerman consumers appear to share this view. While their economic outlook improved they also say that the risk of recession cannot be eliminated, GfK said.\n\nConsumers\u2019 economic expectations came in at minus 9.0 points in September, rising from minus 12.0 points in August, reversing after two consecutive declines, GfK said. Income expectations dropped for the second time, to 46.8 points from 50.1 points. The propensity to buy rose to 55.1 points in September from 48.8 points in August.", "description": "While the already familiar flashpoints, such as the global economic slowdown, trade conflicts and Brexit discussion are affecting consumers, \u201cthe decision of...", "authors": ["Emese Bartha"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR157_berlin_ZG_20190912053817.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
