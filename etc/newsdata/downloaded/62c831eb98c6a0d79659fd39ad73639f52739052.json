I\u2019m done pretending,\u201d he said matter of factly.\n\nAfter Howard was asked if he intends to focus on \u201cphilanthropy and other interests,\u201d the actor insisted he had other ideas in mind, which surprisingly do not include launching his own line of baby wipes.\n\n\u201cNo, not philanthropy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just focusing on bringing truth to the world.\u201d\n\nWhile the Oscar nominee didn\u2019t expand on what exactly said truth looks like, he did say that he\u2019ll miss his \u201cEmpire\u201d colleagues when the show wraps up after six seasons.\n\n\u201cI love the cast members,\u201d he said. \u201cI will miss them a great deal, and the crew.\u201d\n\nMonths after Smollett, who plays Howard\u2019s son Jamal on the series, was accused of staging a homophobic and racist attack on himself in January, the network announced that the series would take its final bow.\n\n\u201cAs the series enters its final season, one thing is for sure, the Lyons never go out without a bang,\u201d Fox said in a press release at the time, referring to the fictional family. He added that the last chapter will include \u201cjaw-dropping moments\u201d and \u201cshocking surprises.\u201d\n\nDespite Howard and other cast members, including co-star Taraji P. Henson, signing a letter of support asking for Smollett to return, series creator Lee Daniels announced a few months back that there were \u201cno plans\u201d for the embattled actor to return.\n\nThe final season of \u201cEmpire\u201d premieres Sep. 24.", "description": "The actor said he plans to focus on \"bringing truths to the world\" instead.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7a8538230000e90352096a.jpeg?cache=odehgnbb7d&ops=1778_1000"}
