She also co-chairs the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the world\u2019s largest philanthropy, with her husband Bill Gates.\n\n\u201cThis announcement is not a departure for Melinda\u2014it\u2019s the latest chapter in her long-standing commitment to gender equality,\u201d a spokesperson at Pivotal Ventures tells Penta.\n\nIn her recent book, The Moment of Lift, Gates describes her conviction in the power and potential of gender equality in lifting up families, communities, and society at large.\n\nIn her op-ed, Gates outlines three priorities in achieving gender equality in the U.S., which is 208 years away, she says, citing data from the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe first priority is dismantling the barriers to women\u2019s professional advancement. The second is fast-tracking women in sectors with outsized impact on society\u2014such as technology, media, and public office. The third is mobilizing shareholders, consumers, and employees to amplify external pressure on companies and organizations in need of reform.\n\nREAD MORE: Christie\u2019s to Offer Art Collection of Ron Miller and Diane Disney Miller\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to see Melinda step up and talk about gender disparity, and make this large-scale investment,\u201d says Debra Mesch, Eileen Lamb O\u2019Gara chair in Women\u2019s Philanthropy at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this happen in the philanthropic space, where women are making large-scale investments to really change the lives of women and girls,\u201d she says. \u201cMelinda is focusing on broadening that from philanthropy to the government sector and the private sector.\u201d\n\nParallel to Pivotal Ventures\u2019s large-scale investment in gender equality, Women Moving Millions is an example in the nonprofit sector \u201cwhere women are hyper-agents who're using their wealth, through philanthropy, to really create social change,\u201d Mesch says.\n\nThe New York-based organization established by Swanee Hunt, the founding director of the Women and Public Policy Program at the Kennedy School of Harvard University and a former U.S. Ambassador to Austria, and her sister Helen, has raised over $500 million for women\u2019s and girls\u2019 causes since its existence in 2007.\n\nREAD MORE: When the Ultra-Wealthy Give, It Is \u2018Almost Like Starting a Business\u2019\n\nGender equality has been chronically underfunded in the U.S. According to data Gates cited from Candid\u2019s Foundation Directory Online, private donors give $9.27 to higher education and $4.85 to the arts for every $1 they give to women\u2019s issues.\n\nAmong the U.S.\u2019s high-net-worth population, about 20% donated to women\u2019s and girls\u2019 causes in 2017, with an average donation of just over $1,800 to these causes, according to the latest U.S. Trust Study of High Net Worth Philanthropy conducted by Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.\n\n\u201cOne billion [dollars] is a lot of money, but I also recognize that it\u2019s only a small fraction of what\u2019s necessary,\u201d Gates says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I hope the financial commitment I\u2019m making today is seen as both a vote of confidence in the experts and advocates who are already working on these issues\u2014and an invitation for others to join the cause and make commitments of their own.\u201d", "description": "The money will go toward fast-tracking women in technology, media, and politics, among other goals", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-113138/social"}
