Politico is reporting that with Democrats moving forward with attempts to impeach the president, gun control isn\u2019t a top priority for the White House at the moment.\n\nThe discussions between senators and the president were always an underdog to produce a breakthrough, but they showed unusual durability since a trio of mass shootings in August brought Trump to the table. But the talks appear unable to survive a Democratic impeachment pile-on. Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), who\u2019s shown some willingness to expand background checks and potentially buck the NRA, called it a \u201clost opportunity.\u201d He said it reminded him of when Trump blew up a May meeting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on infrastructure after the speaker suggested Trump was engaged in a \u201ccover-up.\u201d \u201cIt sets a negative tone and stage for doing a lot of other things,\u201d Braun said of the impeachment trajectory. \u201cIt probably will eat up the lot of energy in the room to talk about other things that I think the public is interested in our addressing, which would be commonsense gun reforms and \u2026 health care.\u201d\n\nOn today\u2019s Bearing Arms\u2019 Cam & Co. Cam is joined by the Second Amendment Foundation\u2019s Alan Gottlieb, who discusses his last conversation surrounding background checks, red flag laws, and more with the White House, as well as the continued threat to the 2nd Amendment, even if the current push on Capitol Hill fades.\n\nAlso on the program today, we\u2019ve got the story of a Cleveland, Ohio man with more than a dozen felony convictions who\u2019s now facing murder charges after killing a bicyclist while behind the wheel of a stolen car. Today\u2019s armed citizen story features an unknown man who came to the aid of a mom in Philadelphia who had a gun held to her head, and our good deed involves an off-duty officer in the right place and at the right time to save a woman choking on a bite of broccoli.\n\nAs always, you can get the show as a podcast at Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, and Townhall.com.
