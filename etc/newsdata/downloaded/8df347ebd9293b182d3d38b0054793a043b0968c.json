REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo\n\nNegotiators for the 16-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) are in the Thai capital Bangkok this week for talks aimed at finalising the giant free trade zone by the end of the year.\n\nTrade Minister Piyush Goyal will join Indian delegates on the weekend for direct talks with his counterparts from China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore.\n\nIndian producers fear cutting tariffs on dairy and other produce would open the door to cheap Chinese imports and threaten an agriculture sector that supports most of India\u2019s 1.3 billion people.\n\nA political ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s party has joined opponents of the free trade pact.\n\nThe nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) called on Friday for a nationwide campaign against the deal, saying any change in tariffs would cripple factories and farms at a time of slowing economic growth.\n\n\u201cRCEP shackles the hands of the government to take the required policy measures to strengthen manufacturing and agriculture,\u201d said RSS economic leader Ashwani Mahajan.\n\nProponents of the deal say it\u2019s better for Indian agriculture to be in the trade zone than out.\n\n\u201cIt would be better for India to have an open approach where agriculture can compete globally rather than adopt a conservative approach,\u201d said A. K. Gupta, director of the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, which falls under the commerce ministry.\n\nIndia has reached an agreement in principle with other countries to include a safeguard mechanism that would trigger duties if goods are dumped from a partner country, a source with knowledge of the negotiations said.\n\nThe trade ministry will issue a statement later on Thursday, a spokeswoman said.\n\nThe RCEP includes the 10 members of the ASEAN grouping of Southeast Asian nations and six Asia-Pacific countries \u2014 China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAside from agriculture products, critics say cheaper Chinese mobile phones, steel, engineering goods and toys could also flood the Indian market.\n\nGovernment officials say the treaty would enable Indian industry to join global supply chains for high-end goods such as electronics and engineering. Greater access to overseas markets would help offset an economic slowdown at home, they say.", "description": "India is pressing ahead with talks to join a China-led free trade pact, officials said on Thursday, despite the fears of some domestic producers that the country would be flooded with cheaper Chinese imports.", "authors": ["Neha Dasgupta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439175984&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990H4", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
