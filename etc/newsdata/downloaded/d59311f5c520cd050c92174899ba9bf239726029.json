Uber, one of the main targets of the legislation, declared that the law\u2019s key provisions would not apply to its drivers, setting off a debate that could have wide economic ramifications for businesses and workers alike in California, and potentially well beyond as lawmakers in other states seek to make similar changes.\n\n\u201cCalifornia sets off a chain reaction,\u201d said Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at Wedbush who tracks the ride-hailing industry. \u201cThe worry is that the wildfire spreads.\u201d\n\nIn California, religious groups said they feared that small churches and synagogues would not be able to afford making pastors and rabbis employees. Winemakers and franchise owners said they were worried they could be ensnared by the law, too. Even some of the contractors for the app-based businesses that have been at the center of this debate said the change could hurt them if companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash decided to restrict how often they could work or cut them off entirely.", "description": "After state lawmakers voted to extend minimum-wage and other protections to independent contractors, Uber said it would not treat its drivers as employees.", "authors": ["Kate Conger", "Noam Scheiber"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/business/11uber2/11uber2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
