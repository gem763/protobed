His side were battered and bruised by a typically abrasive South Africa in a match of few thrills but several spills that was settled by a Handr\u00e9 Pollard penalty five minutes from time.\n\nWales v South Africa: Rugby World Cup semi-final \u2013 live! Read more\n\nSouth Africa will meet England in Saturday\u2019s final, a repeat of 2007 when Eddie Jones, who was in the crowd here, was part of the Springboks\u2019 management team as a consultant. Their style of play has changed little in the 12 years since and they overcame Wales by protecting the gainline.\n\nSouth Africa kicked the ball the first eight times they took possession as the match lived up to its billing as an aerial contest. It took an advantage for the Springboks to dare to attempt a pass and so shocked was Handr\u00e9 Pollard that he dropped the ball with a defender nowhere near him.\n\nPollard kicked the penalty to restore the lead he had given his side from the tee after 14 minutes. Wales quickly equalised when an enterprising move from a line-out that saw George North provide an extra man in the line and force Willie le Roux to step offside, for Dan Biggar to turn to profit.\n\nRugby World Cup 2019: fixtures, tables and results Read more\n\nJones and his defence coach John Mitchell were among the spectators who were treated to rather less movement than the evening before when the holders New Zealand were eliminated. The opening half ran at a kick a minute with Wales shading it 21-19 although they made a few more passes than their opponents\u2019 28.\n\nSouth Africa sought refuge in the set-pieces and mauls as they looked to wear down Wales and force penalties. Pollard kicked his third six minutes from the end of the opening half after Ken Owens entered a ruck from the side, but Biggar reduced the interval deficit to three points with his second kick.\n\nWales had by then lost two players to injury. The prop Tomas Francis left the field clutching his left wrist after Duane Vermeulen was given too much room after gathering a restart and had broken into a gallop when Francis crouched low to bring down the No 8.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wales players ponder defeat after the match.

Faf de Klerk dropped Leigh Halfpenny\u2019s kick downfield into touch and when South Africa jumped across the line-out, Biggar accepted the three points.\n\nNeither side was making a case to take on England. There was an awful passage of play when Wales had three kicks charged down in and around their 22 in less than a minute but South Africa were unable to keep hold of the ball and when Gareth Davies kicked it towards halfway, Willie le Roux followed De Klerk\u2019s example.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nThe last tryless semi-final was in 1999 when Rassie Erasmus was in South Africa\u2019s back row in their 27-21 extra-time defeat to Australia at Twickenham. Neither side had come close to the other\u2019s line after 55 minutes: South Africa had not made much of an effort while Wales struggled to achieve quick possession and struggled to get the ball beyond the first receiver as the Springboks protected the gainline.\n\nAnd then, as if from nowhere, Pollard surprised Wales first with an offload and then by running into their 22 where he got away from a prop, Rhys Carr\u00e9, before being hauled down short of the line. South Africa had a penalty advantage and moved the ball to the left where Damian de Allende shrugged off Biggar\u2019s tackle and took Tomos Williams and Owen Watkin over the line with him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Damian De Allende crashed over the line to score for South Africa after some poor defending from Wales.

Wales\u2019s driving maul was held up and they spent 20 phases trying to batter their way over without making a centimetre. They were awarded a penalty and surprised South Africa by opting for a scrum.\n\nAll Blacks and Steve Hansen share their pain after Rugby World Cup exit Read more\n\nSouth Africa drove forward, forcing Wales\u2019s front row to stand up. The referee Jer\u00f4me Garc\u00e9s let play continue and Jonathan Davies freed Josh Adams on the left for the wing to score his sixth try of the tournament, more than anyone else. Halfpenny converted from wide out to level the scores.\n\nWales kept coming, but when Francois Louw forced Alun Wyn Jones to hold on, South Africa achieved position and a set-piece to set up a maul. When Dillon Lewis strayed offside, Pollard landed his fourth penalty and time ran out for the team that, at the wrong moment, remembered how to lose.", "description": "South Africa will face England in next Saturday\u2019s World Cup final after beating Wales 19-16 in a tense semi-final", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b46f2d910cfb410d622c6da87134ea32d782ff/0_50_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=55d0109195c4f6838a06ca4e313d4270", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
