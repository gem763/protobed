At times, he also threatened to kill her while brandishing a knife and handgun, reports indicate.\n\nThe two were in a two-year relationship prior to the incident.\n\nThe violence began after Foster became paranoid his girlfriend was having him followed, according to investigators.\n\n'Foster also told her that she had cameras hiding all inside the residence that watch him to include the microwave. 'Foster then became very physical with her,' read the text of a police report obtained by the Las Vegas Review Journal.\n\nIt appears Foster's alleged violent rampage could have been avoided.\n\nIn 2018, the 33-year-old was let out of jail on a suspended sentence for carrying a concealed weapon without a permit.\n\nHe was also awaiting trial for a separate domestic violence via strangulation charge involving another woman that took place in 2018, court records show.", "description": "Authorities say\u00a0Benjamin Obadiah Foster, 33, forced his girlfriend to eat lye while holding her captive in her own Las Vegas apartment for 16 days before she escaped on October 2", "authors": ["Chauncey Alcorn For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/07/19476566-0-image-a-27_1570601386674.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
