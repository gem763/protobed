While passengers will usually never see these crew compartments, we had a chance to take a look during this unique research flight. Read on to see the inside of these crew quarters.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nLast weekend, the Australian airline Qantas successfully completed its first test flight for its \u201cProject Sunrise\u201d initiative \u2013 a program to launch regular commercial service from Sydney to New York and Sydney to London.\n\nThe flights, at about 9,900 and 10,500 nautical miles, respectively, represent the farthest \u2013 and currently the longest, in terms of time \u2013 nonstop flights today.\n\nThe flight isn\u2019t expected to launch regular commercial service until at least 2022 or 2023, but Qantas used this flight \u2013 and plans to do the same for the London route \u2013 to conduct research into how pilots, cabin crews, and passengers cope with the long flight time. In particular, data gathered from monitoring of the pilots and flight attendants will be used to help Qantas make a case to Australian aviation regulators that it\u2019s safe to have crew work in shifts for flights approaching 20 hours.\n\nThe airline also tested a redesigned cabin service, meant to help passengers minimize the effects of jetlag as they cross 15 time zones and reduce the magnitude with which an ultra-long-haul flight can exacerbate those symptoms.\n\nRead more: I flew on Qantas\u2019 \u2018Project Sunrise,\u2019 a nonstop flight from New York to Sydney, which took almost 20 hours and covered nearly 10,000 miles \u2013 here\u2019s what it was like\n\nThis flight also doubled as a delivery of a new Boeing 787-9, from Boeing\u2019s Seattle plant. There were only 40 passengers and 10 crew members, including four on-duty pilots. Passengers included several Qantas frequent flyers participating in the research study, off-duty Qantas employees, researchers, and media, including this reporter.\n\nBreaks and adequate rest periods during any long flight are crucial for helping pilots and flight attendants remain alert, and they become even more important when the flight lasts almost a full day.\n\nTo ensure crew members can get some shut-eye in a relatively private setting, long-haul planes are designed with specialized crew rest compartments \u2013 hidden areas of the plane with cots, or bunks, where crews can rest.\n\nMost passengers will never see these hidden rest areas, but this Project Sunrise test was no ordinary flight; the crew was gracious enough to let us take a look at the whole plane while the bunks were unoccupied early in the flight.\n\nHere are the secret parts of the airplane where pilots and flight attendants go to sleep.\n\nNearly 20 hours in the air can take a toll on the human body, but fortunately the four pilots who worked the Project Sunrise research flight were able to get some rest during the trip (also pictured, on the left, is Captain Lisa Norman, the pilot who took delivery of the plane from Boeing\u2019s factory in Seattle).\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nSimilarly, the six flight attendants would need an opportunity to take breaks and sleep during the nearly daylong flight. Just like for the pilots, there\u2019s a secret area of the plane where the cabin crew can go to rest.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nBehind an inconspicuous locked door just ahead of the rear galley, and up a narrow set of three or four steps, there\u2019s the secret compartment where flight attendants can disappear during long-haul flights.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nA 16- or 17-hour flight may seem brutal to you, but it\u2019s flat-out unfeasible for the flight attendants who work such a flight to be on their feet that whole time.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nMost airline labor agreements \u2014 and, often, safety regulations \u2014 require crews to be given a certain amount of time to rest after a set number of hours.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nOn some smaller planes that fly medium- and long-haul, you might see a business-class seat cordoned off for a crew rest. But on bigger jets, there\u2019s a dedicated compartment.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nThere are six narrow bunks in the cabin crew rest on Qantas\u2019 787-9, the plane that operates the \u201cProject Sunrise\u201d flight.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nEach bunk is separated by cushioned dividers and curtains, giving at least a small degree of privacy to each occupant. Less ideal than on the ground, maybe, but still useful considering it\u2019s on board a plane.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nEach bunk on this flight had a pillow, a sheet, and a blanket, plus a personal air vent, like the ones you might find near a passenger seat.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nIt\u2019s surprising and impressive that there\u2019s room for as many bunks as there were, but even though it was a tight fit, there was enough room to get some much needed shut-eye while working the lengthy 10,000-mile flight.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nAs you make your way down the stairs back into the main cabin, there\u2019s a mirror, helping flight attendants maintain the indefatigable and professional image that you might recognize from your long-haul flights.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nAt the front of the plane, just behind the cockpit, there\u2019s another crew rest compartment \u2014 this one is for the pilots.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nJust like the flight-attendant rest area, this is a part of the plane that few passengers will ever see.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nIt\u2019s similar to the flight attendant\u2019s compartment, but there are a couple of differences.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nSince the flight works with four pilots, a maximum of just two pilots will be on break at any given time, so there are only two cots.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nThe beds are a bit wider, since there are only two of them. \u201cSometimes, I sleep better on the long-haul flights than I do at home,\u201d Captain Sean Golding, the lead pilot on the research flight, told Business Insider.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nThe four pilots split their workload to make sure that everyone got enough rest on this research flight. Golding described the shifts: \u201cThe whole crew will be on for the first hour and a half. Then, I\u2019ll take a 2-1/2-hour break. I\u2019ll work for the next 5 1/2 hours, sleep for the next 5 1/2, work the next 2 1/2, and we\u2019ll all be on for the final approach and landing.\u201d\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nFor shorter breaks, or in case there\u2019s a fifth pilot who wants to relax, the compartment also has a folding jump seat with an in-flight entertainment screen that can swing out from the bulkhead.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nThe plane\u2019s business-class seats, which fold out into a bed, are comfortable, but there\u2019s no question that the crew rest areas offer a more private space to relax and rest up.\n\nsource David Slotnick/Business Insider\n\nEven after 19 hours and 16 minutes in the air, doesn\u2019t that look like a well-rested flight crew?", "description": "Business Insider - The four pilots and six flight attendants worked in shifts during a test flight, taking breaks in specialized crew rest areas..
