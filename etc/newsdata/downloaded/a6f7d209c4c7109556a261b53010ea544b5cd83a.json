And if you want peace, hold on to your nation.\"\n\n\"The future does not belong to globalists, the future belongs to patriots,\" he said.\n\nThe event on Tuesday unfolded against the backdrop of flaring tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, backed by its longtime supporter, the United States. The Saudis say Iran was responsible for an attack earlier this month on two oil facilities, which Iran denies.\n\nThe Trump administration, no fan of the Iranian government, has been engaged in an escalating series of harsh words and threats with Tehran. The U.S. has imposed increasingly crippling sanctions.\n\nTrump said the sanctions will only be tightened should the \"menacing behaviour\" of Iran continue.\n\n\"The regime's record of death and destruction is known to us all,\" he said, accusing them of \"fuelling the tragic wars in both Syria and Yemen,\"\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is in New York, is scheduled to address world leaders on Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere, Trump hit predictable notes \u2013 promising a vigorous defence of Israel's interests, accusing China of breaching accepted international trade rules and stressing that the U.S. will demand other countries increase their military expenditures.\n\nThe U.S. will also not participate in global aid initiatives which enable women in other countries to pursue an abortion, he re-emphasized.\n\nIn contrast to his appearance last year, in which he appeared taken aback when some of his boasts were greeted with laughter, Trump mostly plowed ahead with a 35-minute speech with no interruptions or asides.\n\n'Diversity is not a threat'\n\nFor his part, Guterres cited the climate crisis, \"the alarming possibility\" of a Gulf conflict, spreading terrorism and rising inequality as concerns.\n\nHe lamented the expansion of surveillance technology and systems to keep civilians controlled, discrimination and exploitation of migrants and women and girls, and the targeting of human rights advocates, environmentalists and journalists to stifle speech and protest.\n\n\"Diversity is not a threat, but a richness,\" the secretary general said.\n\nBut Trump accused media organizations \u2014 without offering specifics \u2014 of undermining traditional values and traditions, and when it came to the subject of migration, the U.S president painted a world of host countries that squander human capital.\n\nReceiving countries were being \"overburdened\" by the number of migrants,\" he said.\n\nAccusing them of a \"false sense of virtue,\" Trump charged that activists for migrants and and non-government organizations were abetting human smuggling and the \"erasure\" of borders.\n\n\"Your policies are not just. Your policies are cruel and evil,\" he said.\n\nTrump asserted that the U.S. sought to \"invest in the bright future of their own nations,\" but his administration has been criticized for proposing massive cuts in aid to the Northern Triangle in Central America \u2014 the source of the majority of asylum seekers \u2014 and threatening to withhold aid in exchange for safe third-country agreements with Guatemala and Mexico that are meeting with legal challenges.\n\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres opened the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday with a plea to world leaders to embrace diversity. (Richard Drew/The Associated Press)\n\nGuterres's speech was sobering but the secretary-general pointed to the example shown by the world's youth the past week in climate change speeches and protests as a cause for optimism, and said people still believe in \"the spirit and ideas\" of the United Nations.\n\n\"We must do everything possible to avert the great fracture and maintain a universal system, a universal economy with universal respect for international law; a multipolar world with strong multilateral institutions,\" he told presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and ministers from the UN's 193 member states.\n\n\"We the leaders must deliver for we the peoples,\" he added.\n\nTrump, a climate change skeptic, did not mention the environment in his speech, and his overall prescription was wholly different than Guterres's.\n\n\"When our nations are greater, our future will be brighter, our people will be happier and our partnerships will be stronger,\" said Trump.\n\n'The Amazon is not being devastated'\n\nBrazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, who preceded Trump, hit back at what he characterized as \"sensational\" and \"colonialist\" allegations from Western countries over the recent spread of wildfires in Brazil's Amazon, stating that the dry weather was the primary cause.\n\n\"The Amazon is not being devastated or consumed by fire,\" he said, declaring Brazil had \"solemnly committed itself to environmental protection.\"\n\nBoth Trump and Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro characterized socialism as a scourge, pointing to the example of Venezuela and its autocrat Nicolas Maduro. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters)\n\nBolsonaro said his administration was getting the country back on a proper economic footing after years of corruption and mismanagement by its political rivals, seeking to privatize some state-owned companies and welcoming the liberalization of trade, pointing to the Mercosur-European Union trade deal.\n\nHe said Brazil championed human rights and freedom of expression, though critics have accused his administration of employing a heavy-handed response to crime and attempting to control education curriculum by ensuring references to gender ideology and sexual orientation are scrubbed.\n\nElsewhere, Bolsonaro expounded on what he called the \"cruelty of socialism,\" pointing to the collapse of the Venezuelan economy. Bolsonaro said Brazil was doing its part in integrating many of the millions of Venezuelan refugees who've fled for other South American countries.\n\nDelegate from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Venezuela?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Venezuela</a> reads a book as Donald Trump castigates gov\u2019t of Nicolas <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Maduro?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Maduro</a> during his national address to leaders <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@UN</a> General Assembly <a href=\"https://t.co/e266cb8muw\">pic.twitter.com/e266cb8muw</a> \u2014@KentUNCBC\n\nTrump in his speech went even further, calling Venezuela's leader Nicolas Maduro a \"Cuban puppet\" and stating that the U.S. welcomed the day \"when Venezuela will be free and when liberty will prevail throughout this hemisphere.\"\n\nOther speakers on Tuesday morning include the leaders of Turkey, Egypt and Nigeria.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is scheduled to speak later, said he was returning to London immediately afterward, where he will face the fallout of a court ruling against his decision to shut down Parliament in the crucial countdown to the country's withdrawal from the European Union.", "description": "Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u00a0opened the 74th\u00a0United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday with a \"state of the world\" speech that painted a grim picture of an assortment of challenges that could only be confronted by collaboration, a notion largely rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5295229.1569335525!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
