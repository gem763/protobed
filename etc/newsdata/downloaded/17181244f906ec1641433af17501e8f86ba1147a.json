The whistleblower is reportedly a CIA employee who was assigned to the White House.\n\nPelosi officially endorsed the House's impeachment inquiry last week.\n\n\"Ignorance of this thing is, frankly, any of the radical [Democrats] is that they are the absolutely willing to subvert the president of the United States. They are lawless, they are reckless, and then they want to pretend \u2014 Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer want to talk with the president about gun control? Really? Nancy, Chuck, get real,\" Dobbs said Monday night.\n\n\"You're behaving as an enemy of the state. Then you want to play like you are going to make a deal with the president? Oh and I love the fact they offered to sign a deal on gun control in the Rose Garden. Wouldn\u2019t that be sweet? Who the hell do they think they are?\" he continued.\n\n\"Do you know that\u2019s also \u2014 at some point what do you say to Pelosi and Schumer,\" Dobbs asked his guests, who were unwilling to reveal their true feelings on air.\n\n\"Let\u2019s go \u2014 I\u2019m editing quickly. Go to hell,\" Dobbs concluded the segment.", "description": ".10/01/2019 20:30:30PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/274/451fa8ef-c3ba-4c01-abfb-b79717c4fd80.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
