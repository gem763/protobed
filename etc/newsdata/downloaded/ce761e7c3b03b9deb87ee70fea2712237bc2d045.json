Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) \u2015 are particularly noteworthy because of the deputy secretary\u2019s own role in the Ukraine affair, in which President Donald Trump sought to pressure the Ukrainian president into investigating his Democratic rival Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election.\n\n\"Soliciting investigations into a domestic political opponent\u2014I don't think that would be in accord with our values,\" U.S. Ambassador to Russia nominee John Sullivan says at confirmation hearing in response to question from Sen.

Yovanovitch said that Sullivan made this observation to note the unusual circumstances and that he added the decision to recall her was not \u201cfor cause,\u201d as is typically the case when ambassadors are brought home early.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his associates sought to smear Yovanovitch, who was pushing broader anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine, as an anti-Trump operative. In a White House summary of Trump\u2019s call pressuring the president of Ukraine, Trump suggested that Yovanovitch was \u201cgoing to go through some things\u201d after being recalled from her post.\n\nSullivan\u2019s remarks come ahead of a planned vote in the House on Thursday to outline the rules and processes of the impeachment investigation before it heads into a phase of public hearings.", "description": "Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan was also the one who told Marie Yovanovitch there had been a campaign to oust her.", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db9b935210000bb3634b7d4.jpeg?cache=hh7ylfnyqy&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
