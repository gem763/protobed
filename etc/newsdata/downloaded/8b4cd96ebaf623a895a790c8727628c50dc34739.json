This is certainly true for traditional radio, which is being challenged by digital disruptors. Ntombizodwa Makhoba investigates how radio in SA is dealing with digital disruption.\n\nGareth Cliff, the founder of CliffCentral, says online radio is a sustainable and lucrative business, only if you have an exceptional business model and a great team behind the brand.\n\nBut some radio experts disagree with him. Radiomonitor managing director, Jarrod Aston-Assenheim, says an online radio station\u2019s sustainability is not guaranteed, while traditional radio is still winning.\n\nRadio activist and former Metro FM and Touch HD station manager, Martin Vilakazi agrees with Aston-Assenheim: \u201cOnline radio is a new model and a niche industry. It\u2019s sustainability is not guaranteed and commercially viable.\u201d\n\nVilakazi tells #Trending that if you want to run a successful online radio station, you need to have fully branded shows partnering with big brands to get advertising revenue.\n\n\u201cIf one wants a sustainable business, your radio platform has to offer content that is unique. People must tune in, because you are offering something that traditional radio doesn\u2019t offer,\u201d Vilakazi says.\n\nEXPENSIVE DATA IS THE REASON ONLINE RADIO IS DYING\n\nAston-Assenheim says it\u2019s sad that online radio stations are phasing out because of lack of advertising revenue. He says most online radio stations have failed because data is expensive in South Africa and these platforms have been struggling to get the right formula.\n\nAston-Assenheim says that it\u2019s about time the general public speaks in one voice and lobbies service providers to bring down data prices.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not generating advertising revenue, it\u2019s impossible for you to make profit,\u201d Aston-Assenheim says.\n\nNewly appointed Soweto TV CEO Thabo \u201cTbo Touch\u201d Molefe, who launched Touch HD two years ago, shares the same sentiments with Aston-Assenheim. He says the fight to bring down data costs has yielded results with more opportunities for online platforms to mushroom over the past few months.\n\n\u201cLook at Marawa TV [sportscaster Robert Marawa\u2019s platform], and other similar platforms. Online radio\u2019s success in South Africa is inevitable. We need more allocation of spectrum to enable more players in the data network space,\u201d says Tbo Touch, adding that fibre [internet] is rolling out in townships which makes it the right time to invest in online media.\n\nVilakazi feels that the other reason online radio fails is because many online radio stations treat their platforms as an alternative to traditional radio. \u201cPeople must bear in mind that not everyone will leave radio for online radio. Just because you are a famous DJ and you are running online radio doesn\u2019t mean people will replace traditional radio with online,\u201d he says, adding that people\u2019s first choice will definitely be listening to traditional radio because it is free to access.\n\nWHY CLIFFCENTRAL IS STILL STANDING\n\nCliff, who has been running CliffCentral for five years, says the station is more than online radio, but actually a hybrid of content creation, online distribution and a live streaming platform as well as strategic consultancy for content and social media marketing for clients.\n\n\u201cIf we were only an online radio station we\u2019d have been much more limited and probably not as sustainable. We still have a long way to go, but we have pioneered this field and continue to innovate to stay ahead,\u201d Cliff says.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s still unclear how long it took CliffCentral to break even as a business, Cliff says because of his business partner Rina Broomberg\u2019s and his own experience in radio, they have managed to develop a lot of relationships in business.\n\nThat meant they could go into this venture with a \u201cdegree of confidence and some appreciation of the risks\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to have support from day one \u2013 from sponsors and my own loyal listener base \u2013 who followed me to CliffCentral,\u201d he says.\n\nFive years on, the CliffCentral online platform has more than 60 000 app downloads and 38 000 newsletter subscribers. For several weeks we tried to access online radio data, only to be reliably informed that the online radio report would be released early next month.\n\n\u201cI can guarantee you online radio stations that are in existence actually don\u2019t have more than a listenership of 10 000,\u201d Aston-Assenheim says.\n\nCliff says they are sitting on an average of 100 000 live connections a month and 250 000 podcast downloads.\n\n\u201cSome topics attract more downloads than others. But overall, more and more people are finding podcasts [useful] and it\u2019s steadily growing,\u201d Cliff says.\n\nCliff says when they started CliffCentral it wasn\u2019t a walk in the park. He describes it as roller coaster ride and challenging at times.\n\n\u201cThe basics of any business \u2013 cash flow, hiring the right people, unlocking the doors in the morning, creating a quality product and doing deals \u2013 but in an environment where when we started, there was no blueprint, we had to do some heavy lifting,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people thought we would fail but we\u2019re here to stay and [we are] growing.\u201d\n\nBut he admits that as an online digital platform, they still have a long way to go, although they have pioneered this field and continue to innovate to stay ahead.\n\n\u201cThe real value is only being realised now as every business is a broadcaster and helping everyone to create their own podcast content to grow their own audiences,\u201d Cliff says.\n\nAston-Assenheim tells #Trending that podcasts are popular and most online platforms generate advertising revenue through podcast subscribers.\n\nHowever, he warns that commercial radio should not be threatened by online radio, which he says has at least five to 10 years to get the right formula.\n\nTbo Touch, who launched an audio visual content platform \u2013 THD24 \u2013 a few months ago, says the new platform will compete with rival services such as Naspers\u2019 Showmax, currently run by MultiChoice, Netflix and other subscription-based streaming services.\n\nHe adds that the reason he moved Touch HD to THD24, is because audiences are interested in seeing visuals more. \u201cRadio is the theatre of the mind. It\u2019s always important that you give your clients more value, otherwise you will lose your audience,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the past few years, a number of radio personalities have quit their day jobs on commercial radios to start online platforms.\n\nThey include the likes of Sbu Leope, who owns Massiv Metro, and former Ukhozi FM\u2019s personality Ngizwe Mchunu, who launched Ngizwe Mchunu FM. The Durban-based radio personality says Ngizwe Mchunu FM plays mostly traditional music.\n\n\u201cI am excited about the feedback from my followers. I am not going to commercial radio anytime soon. I am living my dream,\u201d Mchunu says.\n\nCliff\u2019s advice to anyone hoping to start an online radio station is: \u201cAnyone can start an online platform, the barriers to entry are low. But like with any business, you need to be sure of your purpose and have a solid business plan and content that attracts an audience.\u201d\n\nHOW TO RUN A SUCCESSFUL ONLINE RADIO STATION: Use Facebook to create and promote your online radio station because almost everyone can access Facebook.\n\nCreate content that is unique, something that traditional radio cannot offer.\n\nCreate podcasts that can be shared with others.\n\nCreate a fan base and engage with your clients across all media platforms.\n\nPlan content that attracts an audience.\n\nHave a solid business plan and know your purpose because not everyone who starts an online radio station is going to succeed.\n\nManage your costs, and making smart financial and business decisions is key.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Every traditional medium is facing its own unique struggles to adjust to digital competition for audiences and advertising revenue.
