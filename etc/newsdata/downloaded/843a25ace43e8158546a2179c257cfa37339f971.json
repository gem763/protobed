It looks unlikely that either will be significantly different this time around - only time and the scales will tell.", "description": "Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz have both been putting in the extra work ahead of their multi-title rematch", "authors": ["Joe Cooper", "Image", "Anthonyjoshua Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20546900.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Joshua-Ruiz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
