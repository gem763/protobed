Out next week, kids. Think of it as a Tory conference chaser. For now, it\u2019s great to see everyone\u2019s favourite political incel break cover, as Dominic Cummings makes a series of appearances among the chaos to announce: \u201cWe are enjoying this.\u201d Such a self-styled antihero. He used to think what happened to his Brexit was a tragedy, but now he knows it\u2019s a comedy.\n\nThe latest clip ends with Cummings blowing a kiss to the news cameras, a reminder that politics allows some people to play out a wishful version of themselves that would be laughed out of town anywhere normal. In any sane arena, Dominic is the answer to the inquiry: \u201cWhat would happen if you shaved Quentin Tarantino\u2019s head but kept everything else much the same?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard this line \u201cthe revolution devours its children\u201d? That\u2019s you, babe.\n\nHe is a political geek. As one of his friends told Tim Shipman for his book All Out War: \u201cDom watched [Bill Clinton campaign documentary] The War Room, I would guess, 40 to 50 times. He would sing the theme music. The missing Dom years were basically spent in a bunker under the Pennines watching The War Room on repeat.\u201d Yet here he is blowing kisses, giving us his hot movie villain. You can stand down, Hollywood \u2013 the spad in the gilet\u2019s got this covered.\n\nIt is thanks to Cummings that the Palace of Westminster this week resembled a sort of meth-addled Hogwarts, and yet Conservative MPs cling to him even though they know he hates them. More on these imbecile henchmen later. Only a political incel could rage in entitlement against \u201cProject Fear\u201d, yet orchestrate \u201csenior allies of Boris Johnson\u201d \u2013 including a cabinet minister \u2013 to inform Friday\u2019s Times that there would be a \u201cviolent, popular uprising\u201d if they don\u2019t do what he wants. Thank you, Anonymous Secretary of State, for treating public life like an angry online forum. Save it for your 10-page manifesto you mail to the newsrooms.\n\nOf course, the thing about incels (metaphorical and otherwise) is that while a huge part of their self-mythology is claiming they represent the unheard, the reality is that people really listen to their shit. Consider the case of the man accused of driving a van into pedestrians in Toronto last year, killing 10 people, who warned in a police video (released on Friday) that he\u2019d start an incel uprising with it all. Nine days \u2013 nine days! \u2013 after that mass murder, I read an extremely serious column in the New York Times that used the event to discuss the \u201credistribution of sex\u201d. As its author put it: \u201cSometimes the extremists and radicals and weirdos see the world more clearly than the respectable and moderate and sane.\u201d\n\nWell, it was an admiring \u201cwow\u201d from me. Men\u2019s rights is wild. These guys really get stuff done. Women have been fannying about for decades asking peacefully for their rights, and we still can\u2019t be in charge of our own bodies. Ten people get killed, and before the fortnight\u2019s out there\u2019s a chinstroker in the world\u2019s leading liberal newspaper wondering how we can address the needs and concerns of the suspect.\n\nLike Cummings, the \u201cbig thinkers\u201d who pander to these instincts are never going to be the ones getting hurt. Just as the guy who wrote that New York Times op-ed truly has my blessing to go and wank off whatever inadequates he likes as a public service to stop male terrorism or something, I suspect he thinks it\u2019s a job for ladies. Not his problem. He\u2019s thunked the thinkpiece, and it\u2019s up to the patsies to enact it.\n\nThere is so much of this to Cummings\u2019 \u201cpeople vs parliament\u201d brand of politics, but the patsies \u2013 the Tory MPs \u2013 are yet to catch on. While most women could read that New York Times column and work out what it basically meant for them, a lot of Conservative MPs are dutifully spouting Cummings\u2019 lines, but don\u2019t yet seem to have worked out where they leave them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boris Johnson speaking in parliament. Photograph: Reuters Tv/Reuters\n\nBut listen, Tory mooks \u2013 I\u2019m here to help. While you\u2019re getting a tiki torch and standing a post, let me tell you what a \u201cpeople vs parliament\u201d election ultimately means for you. First, if you whip up an angry mob, why do you assume they won\u2019t end up angry with you? Do you think the mob is going to come upon an MP and go, \u201cWait, wait \u2013 this is so-and-so. He voted for Meaningful Votes 2 and 3, so we should, you know, definitely not put our pitchforks up his arse\u201d? Eventually, you\u2019re going to get a pitchfork up your arse either way.\n\nTo adapt that phrase of the alt-right to whom you tack closer every day: mobs don\u2019t care about your feelings. If I had to come up with an adjective to help you understand mobs, it would probably be mob-like. Very mobby. Mobtastic. If you go to the country in a people v parliament election, you may indeed get elected and be part of a triumphant Tory majority. But when you have been elected, and when you\u2019ve \u201cgot Brexit done\u201d \u2013 which is to say, when you\u2019ve either taken the UK off the no-deal cliff, or opened up the next however many painful years of trade negotiations fuckery-pokery, which is never going to solve the problems it is magically supposed to \u2013 you, then, are \u201cparliament\u201d.\n\nThe even angrier people are then versus YOU. That\u2019s when they come for you, because you asked them to. You invited them in. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard this line \u201cthe revolution devours its children\u201d? That\u2019s you, babe. Second, I know you\u2019ve already only read about one war, but bad news: it\u2019s the wrong war. You need the first world war, not the second. By way of a crash course of what Dom\u2019s got planned for you, take the line in Blackadder, where the general brays to the guys he\u2019s sending over the top: \u201cWe\u2019ll be right behind you!\u201d and Blackadder mutters: \u201cAbout 35 miles behind you.\u201d You\u2019re the cannon fodder, you\u2019re the Twenty Minuters. But, hey \u2013 enjoy it out there.\n\nDominic Cummings: delivering Brexit only way to solve abuse of MPs Read more\n\nThird, as is blindingly obvious to everyone else, Cummings is one of those masterminds who hates his henchmen. He hates the Conservative party. He believes he\u2019s surrounded by idiots. Again: that\u2019s you, babe.\n\nWhat\u2019s amazing, given he\u2019s written all of this stuff down, and at length, is the selective deafness of the Tories going along with it. They hear the stuff Dom is saying about things being swept away. But they don\u2019t hear the bits that will eventually mean them.\n\nConsider the irony of the European Research Group currently obeying a man who described them as a \u201cnarcissist-delusional subset\u201d, adding: \u201cYou should be treated like a metastasising tumour and excised from the UK body politic.\u201d It\u2019s not a hugely opaque statement.\n\nMore moderate Conservatives should realise where they\u2019re travelling with this stuff. Some people just want to watch your bit of the world burn. You bow to them at your peril \u2013 and ours.\n\n\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Dominic Cummings wants a \u2018people v parliament\u2019 election.
