The latter term is Maryland\u2019s version of an insanity defense.\n\nEmployees of the newspaper who attended the hearing held hands as the attorney addressed the court.\n\nRamos\u2018 plea is the latest turn in his long history with the newspaper. Before the shooting, he had been accused of harassing the Capital Gazette\u2019s staff in connection with a defamation suit he filed against the newspaper in 2012, authorities have said. The suit was thrown out.\n\nAuthorities say Ramos stormed the newspaper office in June 2018 with a shotgun and killed John McNamara, Wendi Winters, Rebecca Smith, Gerald Fischman and Rob Hiaasen. It was one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in U.S. history.\n\nRamos\u2018 mental health had been a point of contention between defense attorneys and prosecutors as they prepared for his trial.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An attorney for the man accused of killing five Maryland newspaper employees last year told a court Monday that he will plead guilty but not criminally responsible by reason of insanity to the murders.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/28/newspaper_shooting_15722_c0-84-3120-1904_s1200x700.jpg?b2327a1430f3b0dfbe9850f0c27f9ee453f65fda", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
