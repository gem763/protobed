These types of ads are risky when combined with the influence of social networks, and letting them run rampant without any oversight is dangerous.\n\nInternet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale. \u2014 jack (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nFacebook, on the other hand, has steadfastly stood by its controversial policy to allow political ads without fact-checking \u2014 in other words, to take money in exchange for boosting the reach of potential lies. (Facebook is far and away the largest internet platform for internet advertising, far outweighing Twitter.) The topic came up repeatedly at a hearing last week in which CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress, ostensibly to answer questions about its struggling Libra blockchain and cryptocurrency project.\n\nThe controversy is already overshadowing Facebook\u2019s rather stellar past three months. It yet again posted better-than-expected earnings, with ad revenue and net income surpassing Wall Street expectation with $6 billion in profit on $17.7 billion in sales. More importantly for Facebook\u2019s long-term growth, the social network keeps getting bigger.\n\nThis past quarter, Facebook\u2019s daily active user count grew 9 percent to 1.62 billion. Its monthly active user account grew 8 percent to 2.45 billion. Facebook says the number of people who use a product in its \u201cfamily of services,\u201d which includes WhatsApp and Instagram, every day is now 2.2 billion. Every month, that figure jumps to 2.8 billion. Facebook says the growth comes mostly from areas like India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.\n\nFacebook keeps adding new users even as its controversies pile up\n\nBut pressure from politicians and the public is mounting on Facebook, specifically with regard to its stance on lies in political ads and with its inclusion of Breitbart News as a trusted source in its recently announced news section. The company continues to see itself as a neutral arbiter for all viewpoints, even those viewpoints that may be misleading or outright false. And it continues to take money from politicians who wish to use its ad network to boost those messages, false or not, to millions of Facebook users.\n\nThe company\u2019s position, that it does not get to decide who gets to speak on its platform, is rooted in the murky politics of free speech. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians,\u201d Zuckerberg has said in defense of the policy. But that position, combined with the recent Breitbart controversy, has ignited another powder keg within the social network, and it\u2019s now receiving considerable pushback both externally and internally.\n\nEmployees wrote an open letter to Zuckerberg, obtained by The New York Times earlier this week, condemning the policy in ways very similar to Dorsey\u2019s stance on the issue. \u201cFree speech and paid speech are not the same thing,\u201d the letter reads. And Democratic politicians, activists, and liberal political action committee (PACs), are all now putting money toward stress-testing Facebook\u2019s hands-off approach to see how far you can go in paying to promote falsehoods on the platform.\n\nOn a call with investors and the media after its earnings report, Zuckerberg recited a pre-written speech defending the company\u2019s policies. In light of Twitter\u2019s announcement, he also said Facebook would be sticking to its stance on paid speech and political ads.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can say we\u2019re not doing what we believe or that we haven\u2019t thought hard about these issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for private companies to censor politicians or news,\u201d he said. \u201cAds can be an important part of voice \u2014 especially for candidates and advocacy groups the media might not otherwise cover so they can get their message into debates. And it\u2019s hard to define where to draw the line.\u201d Zuckerberg also said the policy is not motivated by money; he estimates Facebook will make only 0.5 percent of revenue next year from political ads.\n\n\u201cFrankly, if our goal were trying to make either side happy, then we\u2019re not doing a very good job because I\u2019m pretty sure everyone is frustrated with us. Our values on voice and free expression are not partisan,\u201d Zuckerberg added. He also said he suspects this will be a \u201cvery tough year\u201d for Facebook going into the 2020 US election.\n\n\u201cThis is complex stuff and anyone who says the answers are simple hasn\u2019t thought long enough about all the nuances and downstream challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cI get that some people will disagree with our decisions. I get that some people will think our decisions may have a negative impact on things they really care about. But I don\u2019t think anyone can say we\u2019re not doing what we believe, or that we haven\u2019t thought hard about these issues.\u201d\n\nUpdate October 30th, 5:22PM ET: Added statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg form the company\u2019s earnings call this afternoon.", "description": "Facebook has steadfastly stood by its controversial policy to allow political ads without fact-checking, but Twitter\u2019s sudden political ad ban may complicate that position.
