REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nUsing the U.S. military to stop the Turkish offensive on U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters was never an option, defence officials have said, and Trump asked the Pentagon on Sunday to begin a \u201cdeliberate\u201d withdrawal of all U.S. troops from northern Syria.\n\nAfter Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday that Trump had authorized \u201cvery powerful\u201d new sanctions targeting Turkey, the administration appeared ready to start making good on Trump\u2019s threat to obliterate Turkey\u2019s economy.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump said he was listening to Congress, where Republicans and Democrats are pushing aggressively for sanctions action.\n\n\u201cDealing with @LindseyGrahamSC and many members of Congress, including Democrats, about imposing powerful Sanctions on Turkey,\u201d Trump said on Twitter, referring to the loyal Trump ally and U.S. senator who lambasted the president last week.\n\n\u201cTreasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought. There is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done. Stay tuned!\u201d he added.\n\nA U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that sanctions were \u201cbeing worked out at all levels of the government for rollout.\u201d\n\nTrump is struggling to quell harsh criticism, including from some of his staunchest Republican backers, that he gave Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan a green light to attack the Kurds last Sunday when he decided to pull a small number of U.S. troops out of the border area.\n\nTurkey\u2019s offensive aims to neutralize the Kurdish YPG militia, the main component of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and seen by Ankara as a terrorist group aligned with Kurdish insurgents in Turkey. But the SDF has also been Washington\u2019s key ally in fighting that has dismantled Islamic State\u2019s jihadist \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision, rooted in his long-stated aim to get the United States out of \u201cendless wars,\u201d has prompted bipartisan concerns that it opens the door to the revival of Islamic State.\n\nWhile sanctions appear to be the strongest tool of deterrence, the United States and its European allies could also ponder arms sales bans and the threat of war crimes prosecutions.\n\n\u201cGood decision by President @realDonaldTrump to work with Congress to impose crippling sanctions against Turkeys outrageous aggression/war crimes in Syria,\u201d Graham tweeted.\n\n\u2018MONUMENTAL FAILURE\u2019\n\nIt is unclear what sanctions are in the order drafted last week, which Mnuchin said was ready for activation at any moment, and whether they would be as severe as what lawmakers are proposing.\n\nRepresentatives Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, and Mike McCaul, the committee\u2019s senior Republican, introduced a bill last Friday that would sanction Turkish officials involved in the Syria operation and banks involved with Turkey\u2019s defence sector until Turkey ends military operations in Syria.\n\nIt also would stop arms from going to Turkish forces in Syria, and require the administration to impose existing sanctions on Turkey for its purchase of a Russian S-400 missile-defence system.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Foreign Ministry said late on Friday that Turkey would retaliate against any steps aimed at countering its efforts to fight terrorism, in response to the announcement of possible U.S. sanctions against Turkey.\n\nThe United States has successfully gone after Turkey with sanctions and tariffs before, hitting Ankara last year to pressure authorities to return an American pastor on trial for terrorism charges.\n\nThe United States could look at targeting arm sales to Turkey, something a number of European countries have already done. France said on Saturday that it had suspended all weapon sales to Turkey and warned Ankara that its offensive in northern Syria threatened European security.\n\nThe White House could also look at increasing pressure on Turkey over reports of human rights abuses during the offensive, with a threat of war crimes prosecutions.\n\nThe United States is looking into reports that a Kurdish politician and captured Kurdish fighters were killed in northeastern Syria amid Turkey\u2019s offensive, a State Department spokesman told Reuters, adding that Washington found the reports disturbing.\n\nIn response to the reports, the U.S. official said: \u201cThis is awful. All these are among the issues that is addressed\n\nby our executive order,\u201d referring to the sanctions.\n\nExperts doubted that any of the U.S. punishments would make Erdogan change his mind, given his long-held belief that the Kurdish fighters in Syria threaten national security and whom Ankara sees as a branch of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).\n\n\u201cThis is a monumental failure on behalf of the United States,\u201d said Aaron Stein, director of the Middle East program at the Foreign Policy Research Institute think tank.\n\nStein said it would be the Syrian government or Russia, not American sanctions, that could stop the Turkish operation.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that will stop them is if the regime or the Russians move in significant numbers to where they stop,\u201d Stein said.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe Syrian army will deploy along the length of the border with Turkey in an agreement with the Kurdish-led administration in northern Syria to help repel a Turkish offensive, the Kurdish-led administration said on Sunday.\n\nThe United States does have one person that Erdogan has long wanted extradited: the U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Turkey of orchestrating a failed 2016 military coup against Erdogan.\n\nU.S. officials have said the courts would require sufficient evidence to extradite the elderly Gulen, who has denied any involvement in the coup and has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999.", "description": "President Donald Trump's administration is set to impose economic sanctions on Ankara, potentially as early as this week, for its incursion into northern Syria, one of the few levers the United States still has over NATO-ally Turkey.", "authors": ["Idrees Ali", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440509048&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0Q9", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
