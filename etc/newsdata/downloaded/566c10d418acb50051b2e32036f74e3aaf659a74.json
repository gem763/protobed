We don\u2019t recognize them or even think of them because remarkably, in spite of their numbers, we never hear of one of them causing trouble with a gun, though they often put a stop to robberies and killings, usually without firing a shot.\n\nFor years we\u2019ve been seeking that one gun control law which would save lives. It\u2019s been right under our noses all along. It\u2019s the law that would abolish \u2018gun-free zones\u2019 while leaving private citizens to determine whether weapons are welcome on their property.\n\nThose same legally armed citizens would be sitting with us in church and synagogue and standing in line with us at the bank. Suddenly, schools, parks, government-office buildings, sporting events, etc., would be much safer \u2014 because those who would invade our peace with their weapons would now fear those good guys with guns whom we\u2019ve all heard about. Those who manage to overcome that fear would indeed meet those guys, and the body count would surely be much lower.\n\nThe time has come for such a law.\n\nC.D.
