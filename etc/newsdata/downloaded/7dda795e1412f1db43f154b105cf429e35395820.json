This area has also been a flash point for another hotly disputed policy enacted by the administration. The policy forcing migrants seeking asylum to remain in Mexico for the duration of their case began at the San Ysidro port of entry this year, forcing hundreds of migrant families to wait in shelters in Tijuana.\n\nThe policy has since been extended farther east to more dangerous Mexican cities like Nuevo Laredo, where migrants have been subjected to kidnappings and violence. More than 40,000 migrants have been returned to Mexico under the policy, which the administration says is needed to weed out fraudulent asylum claims and ease the burden on a detention system that experienced extensive overcrowding this year.\n\nThe president was joined by Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, and other top officials who are also still serving in an acting capacity, underscoring the extensive turnover at the department as the president has repeatedly fired officials who disappointed him in cracking down on immigration, including its general counsel, who was dismissed just this week. \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with the job they were doing,\u201d Mr. Trump said, but added that he would announce permanent appointments soon.\n\nMr. Trump said he still expected to get nearly all of the 500 miles completed by the time he stands for re-election next year and said more was not needed because of natural barriers along stretches of the border. While Mexico is not paying for the wall, he noted that it is paying for its soldiers to stop migrants in a more aggressive campaign begun in recent months under pressure from Mr. Trump.\n\nThe characteristically money-conscious president repeatedly noted that this was the most expensive possible variant, saying he had originally wanted a simple and less costly concrete barrier but was convinced by Border Patrol professionals that it would be better to have a slatted barrier that they could see through to observe any potential threat on the other side. \u201cThat\u2019s the Rolls-Royce version,\u201d he said in a chagrined tone.\n\nMr. Trump said the steel slats would be wired \u2014 the Army general accompanying him declined to elaborate \u2014 and added that they would absorb heat so that they would be too scalding for potential migrants to even touch, much less scale. \u201cYou can fry an egg on that wall,\u201d he said.\n\nMark Morgan, the president\u2019s acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, called the new barriers \u201ca game changer\u201d that has reduced illegal crossings.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s photo op at the border was his only public appearance during two days in California, a state that has been a hotbed of opposition to his presidency and policies.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/us/politics/18dc-trump/18dc-trump-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
