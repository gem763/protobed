It was lifted out of the water and passed to ZSL who will carry out a post mortem over the weekend.\"\n\n(Image: The Liquid Highway/Triangle News)\n\nMr Garside added he \u201ccould not believe it\u201d that two dead whales have been found in a short space of time.\n\nAn image of the sea limp animal floating next to docks was posted to Facebook with the caption: \"A photo sent to me that I am told was taken this morning at Gravesend, showing an unconfirmed whale that has died.\n\n\"Unsure if it has been recovered by the PLA, but the relevant authorities have been made aware.\"\n\n(Image: The Liquid Highway/Triangle News)\n\nIt comes after the humpback died after swimming into the Thames last week.\n\nIt was spotted surfacing in the river but was then found dead near Greenhithe, Kent, soon after.\n\nThe ZSL said the young female - nicknamed Hessy - was struck by a ship.\n\n(Image: The Liquid Highway/Triangle News)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHumpback whales are rarely stranded around the UK coast with just one or two incidents recorded on average each year.\n\nBut Hessy was the fifth humpback to be recorded stranded in the UK so far this year.\n\nTwo others recorded in the Thames and wider Thames estuary region in 2009 and 2013 both died.", "description": "A post mortem on the mammal will be performed by scientists from the Zoological Society of London over the weekend", "authors": ["Nadeem Badshah", "Image", "The Liquid Highway Triangle News", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20649704.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Second_Whale_Thames_2_TRIANGLENEWS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
