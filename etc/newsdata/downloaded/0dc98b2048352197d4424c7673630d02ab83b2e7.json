(Joshua Lott/Reuters)\n\nThe political contradictions of progressivism\n\n\u2018The fact is there is no more money. Period,\u201d says Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot.\n\nShe\u2019s talking about the teachers\u2019 strike that has paralyzed her city\u2019s public schools \u2014 enrollment 360,000 \u2014 for the past week. The public employee union is demanding more: more money for salaries (only eight states pay teachers more than Illinois), more support staff (Illinois ranks first in spending on administrators), more teachers per student. Their cause has attracted national attention. Elizabeth Warren joined the picket line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich is ironic. Lightfoot is not some stingy Republican. Nor is she a centrist Democrat like her predecessor Rahm Emanuel. She\u2019s as progressive as you can get. But she now finds herself in the same position as many of her political brethren: facing criticism for failing to reconcile the contradictions in the left\u2019s agenda.\n\nLightfoot has discovered that there is no limit to the appetite of the constituencies generated by government spending. She has learned that the special interests bargaining for higher benefits also desire policies that make such benefits unattainable. I hope she\u2019s taking notes.\n\nChicago Public Schools has run a deficit for the past seven years. Why? Pensions granted to earlier generations of teachers are expensive. And the cost is growing. A quarter of the school budget is devoted to benefits \u2014 money that can\u2019t be spent on classrooms, facilities, and instruction. Expect that number to rise as America goes gray and the bill comes due for the promises we made to ourselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe federal government can put Social Security and Medicare on the credit card for as long as demand for U.S. Treasuries is high. States and municipalities don\u2019t have that luxury. There is an upper bound to what even the most progressive mayors and governors can grant the lobbies that mobilize voters for their campaigns. But it\u2019s a glass ceiling. Public sector unions are eager to break it.\n\nNor does being woke protect you. It\u2019s impossible to appease fully the groups fighting to claim resources and honor. They often won\u2019t take yes for an answer. GM might tout to investors the fact that it is \u201cleading in gender equality.\u201d That didn\u2019t stop the UAW from striking.\n\nPublic policy inspired by the ethic of social justice inflames the tension between progressive leaders and the voting public. Andrew Cuomo might sympathize with Mayor Lightfoot. His fealty to environmental groups has backed him into a corner. Banning fracking and canceling pipelines hasn\u2019t just denied New York revenues, jobs, and lower energy bills. It also led energy supplier National Grid to cancel gas hookups in Long Island. Cuomo had to retaliate before the company restored service. Want to be a progressive? Claim credit for resolving a crisis of your own making after threatening to unleash state power on private actors responding to price signals. Cuomo makes it look easy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGavin Newsom also has been struggling to reduce the conflict between the imperatives of the new progressivism and the quality of life of everyday people. He has his hands full. Rising numbers of homeless have led to a breakdown of public order in areas of Los Angeles and San Francisco. Land-use regulations have restricted the supply of housing, leading to high prices and shortages, and Newsom\u2019s answer is statewide rent control that will make things worse. California\u2019s budget depends so heavily on revenues from the wealthy that it might not recover from another out-migration like the one the state experienced after a 2012 tax hike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPacific Gas & Electric is a case study in the progressive self-own. The state-regulated utility spent years deferring maintenance while it invested in renewable energy and promoted the ideology of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Among the consequences of its neglect were terrible wildfires that devastated communities. The ensuing legal bills drove PG&E into bankruptcy. It says it\u2019s been forced to engage in \u201cde-energization\u201d: purposeful mass blackouts to prevent further damage and legal action. In early October more than two million people were left in the dark. No house, no power, no prospects \u2014 welcome to the California Republic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe contradictions of progressivism generate crises of affordability and governance. But the political class suffers few consequences. Chicago, New York, and California remain Democratic strongholds. What scattered opposition exists is internal to the political machine. On rare occasions parts of the coalition splinter from the whole and are able to defeat radical measures. Think of Bill de Blasio\u2019s stalled plans to cancel entrance exams for New York City\u2019s magnet schools. For the most part, though, the Democrats\u2019 hold on power continues. It\u2019s one monopoly progressives don\u2019t seem to mind.\n\nAre the voters in these communities merely complacent? Are they so content with the patchwork of benefits and status the jerry-rigged welfare state provides that they tolerate dysfunction? Or is the partisan alternative so appalling they won\u2019t even consider it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuestions worth pondering as progressives prepare to scale up their model nationwide. Who knows? One day, President Warren might be on the other side of that picket line.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Washington Free Beacon.", "description": "The contradictions of progressivism generate crises of affordability and governance.
