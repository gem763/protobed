Sign on for this special delivery\n\nThis special delivery is one you won't mind waiting for. (Photo: California Costumes)\n\nFor the pup that barks whenever the doorbell rings, this UPS getup is just the thing. UPS box stayed velcroed to the \u201chands\u201d and the rest doesn\u2019t drag on the ground or droop when the dog is on the move. As the costume attaches around the neck and chest (and over the front legs, for which no measurement is given), you should choose your dog\u2019s size by those two measurements. The hat, which is really more of a headband that fastens under the chin, can be finicky to adjust and keep in place\u2026 and will probably only last for a quick photo before it shifts or the pup shakes it off.\n\nGet California Costumes UPS Delivery Driver Dog Costume on Chewy for $12.50\n\n66.

The glasses and hat aren\u2019t likely to stay put for long, but really all you want them for is a photo op. The t-shirt is on the sheerer side, which is good for pets who have a lot of fur and might overheat in a thicker material. And, while the quality could be better for the price (no doubt inflated because of the licensing), the cuteness factor alone makes it worth it.\n\nGet Rubie's Where's Waldo Pet Costume on HalloweenCostumes.com for $24.99\n\n67. Let a four-legged jack o\u2019 lantern lead the way\n\nWhat neighbors wouldn't welcome this Jack (or Jill) o' Lantern to their stoop? (Photo: Frisco)\n\nThis classic Halloween disguise is well sewn from a soft velvety material, with an appliqued (not screen-printed) jack-o-lantern face. It also couldn\u2019t be simpler to put on, with just two velcro straps, one around the neck, and one around the chest behind the front legs. As with any costume with a hat, the pumpkin top probably won\u2019t last long on an active pup, but the hat doesn\u2019t make or break the costume in terms of the look, so if you just left it at home, no one would be the wiser.\n\nGet the Frisco Pumpkin Dog & Cat Costume on Chewy.com for $16.99 to $18.99\n\n68. Make \u201cwho rescued who\u201d jokes all night long\n\nIn this getup, your mutt can rescue you right back. (Photo: Rubie's Costume Company)\n\nThe reasons this pet getup is super: The costume is designed in three parts\u2014the chest plate, the belt, and the cape\u2014all of which you tie into place around the dog. Even though the tie-on style makes choosing the size less fussy than costumes that fit like a shirt, you still should eyeball the size chart.\n\nGet Rubie's Costume Company Classic Superman Dog & Cat Costume on Amazon for $8.50 to $11.59\n\n69.

The pirate body fits over the dog's front legs like pants, and fastens via velcro strap around the neck.

Pop on this sweet treat\n\nSuit a bubbly personality. (Photo: Rubie's Costume Company)\n\nGumballs from an old-school machine like one this costume is modeled after may only cost five cents, but the look is priceless. The dress runs snug based on the measurements provided, so size up for pups between sizes. On the other hand, the hat is enormous and has only a flimsy elastic strap to cinch it. Another costume hat bites the dust.\n\nGet Rubie's Costume Company Red Gumball Dog Costume at Party City for $16.99\n\n71. Give everyone the munchies\n\nA cute dog dressed as your fave fast food? Resistance is futile. (Photo: Bootique)\n\nDressing your pet as a hot dog? So cliche. A taco costume is mas caliente\u2014and makes it far less weird when other people gush about wanting to just eat your dog up. This costume is simple to put on, fitting like an oversized saddle over the dog\u2019s back and attaching with a velcro strap beneath the belly. The taco comes in a wide range of sizes, from XXS to XXXL, and is pretty good quality.\n\nGet the Bootique Taco 'Bout It Dog Costume at Petco for $21.99\n\n72.

(Photo: Pet Krewe)\n\nThis costume draws raves for its simplicity\u2014and it\u2019s sure to make trick-or-treaters roar with laughter when your dog greets them at the door. No sleeves, no back, just a wide collar-like headdress that wraps around the neck and ears and fastens securely with velcro at the back. The mane, er, main issue: the small size is tiny, even for small dogs. Pet Krewe makes a larger and more elaborate mane for bigger dogs, which goes around the head and down the chest, so if its dimensions\u2014it claims to fit a 13 to 32-inch neck\u2014look promising, your dog may wear it with pride.\n\nGet the Pet Krewe Lion Mane for small dogs on Amazon for $14.95\n\nGet the Pet Krewe Lion Mane for large dog on Amazon for $14.95\n\n73.

It comes in sizes XS to XL, so if your dog\u2019s measurements fits the size chart\u2014and he or she is tolerant of both heat and clothing\u2014this onesie will bring whimsy to your Halloween festivities.\n\nGet the Pets First LaurDIY Unicorn Onesie on Amazon for $19.95\n\n75.

It comes in two sizes\u2014small/medium and medium/large\u2014but there\u2019s more leeway with sizing, since it\u2019s not wrapping around the dog\u2019s body. Prepare to quack up when you see your dog styling Donald\u2019s fluffy hair and big bowtie! Just know you may need to get creative with some thread on the foot straps to keep them in place if your dog has small feet and ankles.\n\nGet the Rubie's Costume Company Donald Duck Pet Accessory Kit on Amazon for $11.49\n\n76.
