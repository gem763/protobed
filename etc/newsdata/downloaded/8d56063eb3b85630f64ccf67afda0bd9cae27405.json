He led the Vikings on four straight TD drives starting in the first quarter and ending in the third, going ahead for the first time on a 5-yard pass to C.J. Ham to make it 28-21.\n\nIt certainly helped to have the option, or the threat, of handing the ball off to Dalvin Cook.\n\n\u201cThey did a great job of running the ball,\u201d Detroit coach Matt Patricia said. \u201cThey knocked us off the line of scrimmage.\u201d\n\nCook had 25 carries for 142 yards rushing and scored his second TD after Cousins connected with Diggs late in the game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running the ball, which sets up the play-action pass and gives us a lot more options on offense,\u201d Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said. \u201cThat\u2019s really working for us right now.\u201d\n\nMinnesota has won three consecutive games in part because Cousins is making plays to complement one of the NFL\u2019s top defenses.\n\nCousins is the first QB in league history to throw for at least 300 yards with a 130-plus passer rating in three straight games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always known we had a ton of talent of offense,\u201d said tight end Kyle Rudolph, who caught Cousins\u2019 fourth TD pass. \u201cIt was just a matter of using it and getting everybody involved.\u201d\n\nMatthew Stafford also threw four TD passes, all to Marvin Jones, and became the fastest to reach 40,000 yards passing in NFL history.\n\nJones became the first Lions player in the Super Bowl era with four receiving TDs in a game and joined Jerry Rice and Sterling Sharpe as the only players in the league since 1950 to catch four TD passes in two games.\n\n\u201cMarv\u2019s a true pro,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cDoes everything we ask him.\u201d\n\nThe Lions (2-3-1) dropped their third straight game after a 2-0-1 start and they probably can\u2019t complain too much about officiating in their latest setback. The Lions had some critical penalty calls go against them in a 23-22 loss to Green Bay on Monday night.\n\nDetroit\u2019s defense simply couldn\u2019t get Cousins off the field.\n\nAfter Stafford threw a season-high fourth TD with 3:10 remaining, the Vikings ended any comeback hopes.\n\nVikings offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski called for Cousins to loft a long pass to Diggs on a second-and-5 from his 30 and the speedy receiver took a 66-yard reception to the Lions 4 to set up Cook\u2019s TD run.\n\n\u201cIt just shows the trust that Kevin has in Kirk and Diggsy to make a huge play,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cIt also takes trust in eight other guys that we\u2019re going to protect.\u201d\n\nDiggs finished with seven receptions for 142 yards.\n\nAdam Thielen caught the first of four TD passes from Cousins in the first quarter and the receiver didn\u2019t return because of a hamstring injury.\n\nStafford was 30 of 45 for 364 yards with four TD passes and an interception on his last possession. Jones had 10 receptions for four TDs, matching his best total from 2013 when he played for Cincinnati. Danny Amendola had eight receptions for 105 yards.\n\nINJURIES\n\nVikings: Thielen had a game-ending hamstring injury in the first quarter after he was hurt while scoring his seventh TD of the season. Zimmer didn\u2019t have an update on Thielen\u2019s condition after the game.\n\nLions: RB Kerryon Johnson (knee) and CB Darius Slay (hamstring) were injured during the game and did not return.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nVikings: Host Washington on Thursday night.\n\nLions: Host the New York Giants on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Minnesota Vikings were so confident in Kirk Cousins they called for a deep pass, instead of a more conservative run, to seal a victory against the Detroit Lions.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Lage"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/vikings_lions_football_31858_c0-216-5184-3240_s1200x700.jpg?48c42b2789ee0d08ce9a91ab8317603cc81a12f8", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
