And Then Donald Trump Laughed.", "language": "en", "text": "Oscar nominee Gary Busey allegedly sexually assaulted a female Apprentice employee during his time on the show, five Apprentice employees tell The Daily Beast. Donald Trump knew about the incident, laughed it off, and kept Busey on his TV series, these staffers said.\n\nMultiple Apprentice employees, including the alleged victim herself, told The Daily Beast that the Academy Award-nominated actor \u201cgrabbed\u201d one of their colleagues \u201cfirmly between [the] legs\u201d during the 2011 season of Celebrity Apprentice. Busey also forcibly put the female staffer\u2019s hand on the crotch of his pants. The alleged incident, which they say took place during a location shoot in SoHo in New York City, prompted a firestorm among members of the Apprentice crew.\n\nTen women have accused Trump of inappropriately touching them ever since the release of a 2005 video in which he boasted of grabbing women \u201cby the pussy.\u201d This alleged Apprentice incident shows that Trump was more than an accused groper\u2014he allegedly condoned such ugly behavior in others, as well.\n\nThe Trump campaign and publicists for Apprentice executive producer Mark Burnett did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this story.\n\nAs described by five sources, the alleged incident occurred when celebrity contestants were tasked by Trump to sell art at a gallery. The cast and crew were taking a break outside the gallery before shooting began that day, the female employee allegedly assaulted by Busey said. And that\u2019s when Busey grabbed her.\n\nShe, along with her Apprentice colleagues, spoke on the condition of anonymity due to restrictive non-disclosure agreements signed by those involved with the NBC series\u2019s production. The alleged victim, who hadn\u2019t before gone public with her claims, agreed with The Daily Beast to be quoted for this story.\n\n\u201cThey had booze for the [gallery party], I think Lil Jon ordered it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so, a few of the celebrities wanted to do a shot together after we finished [setting up] for the show. We all took a shot together, and then went to stand together for B-roll time.\n\n\u201cWe were smoking cigarettes outside, and Busey was standing next to me. And then at one point, he grabbed me firmly between my legs, and ran his hand up my stomach, and grabbed my breasts,\u201d she continued. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. So I made this joke that, \u2019Oh, I\u2019ve never been sexually harassed by a celebrity before!\u2019 Then he grabbed my hand and put it [over] his penis, and said, like, \u2018I\u2019m just getting started, baby.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThen my friend jumped in between [me and Busey] and put his hand on Busey\u2019s chest.\u201d\n\nShe was disturbed by the alleged incident, and her friends and colleagues on the series were furious. Some staffers asked for Busey to be kicked off the show, and the internal dissent grew loud enough that producers and management were all briefed on the incident. The news made it all the way up the chain of command, multiple sources told The Daily Beast, and made its way to Trump\u2019s ear. The real-estate mogul ultimately gave Busey little more than a chuckle and a soft slap on the wrist. (Busey was allowed to remain on the show for the duration of the season\u2014until he was \u201cfired\u201d and came in sixth place.)\n\nThe alleged victim said that she didn\u2019t push the matter further because she feared for her livelihood.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get hired again by the company if I said something like that [and pursued further action],\u201d she said.\n\nShe also said that Trump would say \u201cgross things all the time\u201d during The Apprentice, and that the atmosphere of Trump Tower was \u201ca disgusting place to work\u201d due to the high frequency of sexual harassment. When asked if the recent rash of sexual-assault and harassment allegations against the Republican presidential nominee surprised her, she simply said: \u201cNo. No they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Trump] is and always has been a joke\u2014I can\u2019t believe anyone now is taking him seriously,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe\u2019s a monster.\u201d\n\nHer colleagues at the time confirmed her account of the alleged Busey incident.\n\n\u201cThere was a moment where [Busey] basically grabbed her tits, and grabbed her hand [and] put it on his package there,\u201d a staffer who witnessed the incident told The Daily Beast. \u201cAnd a second friend, who was with her, had to push him away. And they were both like, \u2018What the heck?\u2019\u201d\n\nStaffers contend that neither Trump nor the senior Apprentice staff took anything resembling serious action in response to the alleged groping and unwanted advances.\n\n\u201c[Trump] didn\u2019t want to pursue it too much,\u201d the staffer said. \u201cThe production team knew. This was a big thing for a while [on the show]\u2026 My part of the crew wanted [Busey] kicked off the show.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said something lewd to her and then started grabbing at her,\u201d another staffer who was told of the incident at the time said. \u201cEveryone was talking about it outside for a while. There was a lot of talk about it\u2026 The producers never made anything of it. I believe they should have.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a particularly galling turn of events, considering that Trump in 2010 axed female contestant Maria Kanellis from the show for what he called her inappropriate \u201clocker-room talk.\u201d (She described another contestant leaving a \u201cstench\u201d after using the restroom.) In the following season, when his pal Busey was accused of sexual assault, he refused to boot him off the show.\n\nFour colleagues of Busey\u2019s alleged assault victim said that producers informed Trump of the \u201cgallery incident,\u201d and that Trump asked Busey about it in The Apprentice boardroom as they were preparing to shoot that part of an episode.\n\n\u201cThis was brought to Trump\u2019s attention later, and there was something when he questioned Busey in the boardroom about it, and the resolution was Trump saying, \u2018Keep your hands to yourself,\u2019\u201d a former staffer, who heard their conversation as it took place, said.\n\n\u201cGary, did you do a bad thing\u2026 [and] got your hands where they\u2019re not supposed to be,\u201d the Apprentice staff member recalls Trump as saying, noting that the two of them were \u201cyukking\u201d it up as Trump was supposedly disciplining him. Another staffer recalled Trump calling Busey a \u201cbad boy, a very bad boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump knew, he definitely knew,\u201d another Apprentice staffer said. \u201cI was in the control room when that happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn that show, everything gets run up the chain of command\u2026 it all goes to Trump,\u201d another said. \u201cThe producers prep him on what\u2019s coming up\u2026 [whether it\u2019s] fights among the contestants, or different things. He knew everything going on. I do remember [Trump] discussing it with Gary Busey in the boardroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did something pretty consistent with what Mr. Trump\u2019s been doing,\u201d one former Apprentice employee asserted of Busey\u2019s actions. \u201cThe way management dealt with that was not at all.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile the expectation was that anybody behind the camera was to maintain a strict decorum.\n\n\u201cWe were always taught to never really interact with the celebrities,\u201d the staffer said. \u201cWe\u2019re really encouraged not to interact with them, so him coming over to the female [employees]\u2014it is crossing a line.\u201d\n\nAccording to longtime members and veterans of the Apprentice staff\u2014The Daily Beast has contacted more than 50 over the course of our investigation\u2014the climate on-set was such that women were often subjected to misogynistic and in some cases harassing remarks.\n\n\u201cThere was definitely a lot of pervasive sexism,\u201d one staffer claimed. \u201cThere were some real celebrities [who] were openly sexist and it was tolerated. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for these young ladies in the talent department [who] would burst into tears because so and so told them to \u2018sit on it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis was documented in an Associated Press story in which many former staffers claimed that Trump made crude and misogynistic comments during the taping of his reality-TV series. Additionally, the 2011 season of The Apprentice was particularly marred with scandal.\n\nAs The Daily Beast previously reported, that was the season Trump repeatedly mocked deaf Oscar-winning actress Marlee Matlin as being mentally \u201cretarded.\u201d (A campaign spokesperson later said that was \u201cuntrue.\u201d) Regarding that same year, Richard Hatch, another contestant on the show, claimed Trump made sexist remarks to Matlin and another contestant, Lisa Rinna. In a subsequent season, Trump also repeatedly called rapper and contestant Lil Jon an \u201cUncle Tom.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Busey seems to have had some previous issues with women, including an incident in 1999 when he was investigated for domestic violence after his wife claimed that he \u201cgrabbed her shoulders and wrestled her to the ground.\u201d He was freed after posting bail. Two years prior, a United Airlines flight attendant claimed that Busey hit her after she bumped into him. There were no subsequent criminal charges filed.\n\nBusey struggled with substance abuse in the 1990s and appeared on a few reality-television shows prior to Celebrity Apprentice. In 2012, he endorsed Trump for president when the real-estate mogul first considered running.\n\nBusey\u2019s manager, Ron Sampson, denied the charge in a statement to The Daily Beast. \u201cIn response to your ludicrous inquiry, we will not bother and/or disrupt the life of a wonderful 72-year-old man who has enjoyed a flawless career for over 45 years, to entertain such ridiculous and false accusations,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMr. Busey has better things to do with the rest of his life, like help raise his 6-year-old son, and enjoy his family on his free time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is our belief this is clearly an attempt to gain five minutes of fame for some wannabe, or perhaps a political attempt to drag Mr. Busey in the mud because he has been labeled a supporter of Donald Trump, which is false,\u201d he continued. \u201cMr. Busey has never officially endorsed Donald Trump, has no interest in politics, and is extremely fed up with being associated as a Donald Trump supporter when he is not.\u201d\n\n\"We are putting you on alert that if you print ANYTHING of the sort regarding an alleged anything, you are clearly opening yourself for a lawsuit,\" he concluded.\n\nAfter the alleged sexual-assault incident, Busey would return for another season two years later. His alleged victim was still working on The Apprentice when he made his return.\n\n\u2014with additional reporting by M.L.
