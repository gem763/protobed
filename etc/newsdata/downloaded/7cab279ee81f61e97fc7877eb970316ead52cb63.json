(AP) - Microsoft on Wednesday reported its latest solid quarterly report card to Wall Street, buoyed by another round of business customers signing up for its cloud computing services.\n\nThe company reported fiscal first-quarter profit of $10.7 billion, up 21% from the same period last year.\n\nThe net income of $1.38 per share beat Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.25 per share.\n\nThe software maker posted revenue of $33.1 billion in the July-September period, up 14% from last year and also beating forecasts. Ten analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $32.2 billion.\n\nMicrosoft shares have risen 35% since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index has risen 20%. In the final minutes of trading on Wednesday, shares hit $137.11, an increase of 27% in the last 12 months. It\u2019s been dueling with Apple this season as the most valuable company in the S&P; 500.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella has been rewarded for his efforts in steadily lifting the company\u2019s earnings since taking over in 2014. His compensation was $42.9 million in the fiscal year that ended in June, a 66% raise over the previous year, according to a statement filed last week ahead of the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in December.\n\nThat included a $1 million base salary increase, which the board said it awarded because of \u201chis significant contributions to Microsoft\u2019s success during his tenure as CEO\u201d and a desire to encourage his \u201ccontinued strong leadership.\u201d\n\nThe strongest sales growth has come from adding new corporate and government clients to Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing platform. Azure\u2019s quarterly revenue grew 59 percent from the same time last year, much of that powered by contracts worth at least $10 million each, the company said.\n\nA less profitable part of Microsoft\u2019s business has been its consumer products, such as Xbox, which saw no revenue growth in the quarter, and Surface laptops, which declined 4%. The Surface team, though a small part of Microsoft\u2019s business, launched a new line of devices this fall and expects demand to pick up during the holiday season.\n\n_____\n\nParts of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Microsoft on Wednesday reported its latest solid quarterly report card to Wall Street, buoyed by another round of business customers signing up for its cloud computing services.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/earns_microsoft__29018_c0-280-6720-4200_s1200x700.jpg?549b535615f604a464414eea45420bce1df5565c", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
