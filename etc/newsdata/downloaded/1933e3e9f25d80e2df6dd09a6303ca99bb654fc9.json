There have been campaigns for more to be added\n\nWhile annual road death stats have remained almost unchanged for seven years, they are down by almost a third compared with a decade ago\n\nThese have come in for heavy criticism since they were first introduced in 2006, and it has only intensified in recent weeks following a growing number of cases where motorists have been killed.\n\nFour people have died on the same 16-mile stretch of M1 in just 10 months after being hit by traffic in a live lane that used to be the hard shoulder, according to reports.\n\nALR smart motorways use the hard shoulder as an active lane to reduce congestion, while dynamic hard shoulder (DHS) routes can also be operated in the same way during peak driving times.\n\nA recent poll found that more than one in five drivers have ignored a red x sign on smart motorway in the last 12 months as concerns for their safety have escalated\n\nMotorway fatalities rose by 8% last year, which was the greatest proportional increase of the three road types\n\nHowever, the bid to improve traffic flow means drivers who break down or crash only have access to 'emergency refuge areas', which are safe lay-bys off the motorway that only appear every 1.5 miles.\n\nThe 3 types of smart motorway 1. Controlled Motorway Multiple lanes, variable speed limits and a hard shoulder for emergencies only. 2. Dynamic Hard Shoulder Variable speed limits and a hard shoulder that can be turned into a fourth lane when needed. Drivers are told via electric overhead signs to use the hard shoulder during peak hours. 3. All-Lanes Running Variable speed limits and a permanent fourth lane instead of a hard shoulder. Emergency refuge areas can be found every 2.5km (1.55 miles).\n\nIf drivers are unable to make it to these emergency refuge areas they are left stricken on the motorway, and could be there for up to an hour before help arrives, according to leaked Highways England report.\n\nBut despite growing concerns for their safety, Highways England said in response to the DfT's casualty stats on Thursday: 'Separate analysis of smart motorway all-lane running schemes continues to indicate that they are as safe as our wider motorway network.'\n\nRichard Leonard, Highways England\u2019s head of road safety, added: 'Our aim is to provide a network where no one is killed or injured while travelling on our roads \u2013 today\u2019s report indicates there is still much more that needs to be done.\n\n'The numbers are very concerning and while over the last 15 years safety has improved and our roads are amongst the safest in the world, each incident is a tragedy for the individuals and the families involved.'\n\nHighways England said analysis of smart motorway all-lane running schemes continued to indicate that they 'are as safe as our wider motorway network'\n\nConcerning rise in deaths for the oldest age group\n\nLyes said another big concern highlighted in the latest report was the rise in fatalities among the oldest age groups - those 60 years and older.\n\nThere were some 588 road deaths in this age bracket last year, which was up by five per cent.\n\nThe DfT explained: 'This increase was due to more older fatalities as car drivers in 2018 (165 fatalities in 2017 and 180 in 2018) and drivers of motorcycles over 50cc (44 in 2017 and 50 in 2018).'\n\nThe Government's transport division said the increase was down to there being more older motorists on the road.\n\n'The population in this age group has increased by two per cent compared with 2017 and by 17 per cent compared with 2008,' the report said.\n\n'This relatively rapid growing population may partly explain the upturn in fatalities and killed or serious injured casualties seen for this age group in the last few years.'\n\nAnalysis of road deaths by age groups has revealed that the only significant rise has been for motorists over 60, up 5% year-on-year\n\nConcerns regarding the safety of older drivers at the wheel were heightened earlier this year following the Duke of Edinburgh's high-profile accident\n\nThe safety of older drivers at the wheel was brought into question earlier this year following Prince Philip's high-profile crash near the Royal's Sandringham residence in Norfolk in January.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh, who was 97 at the time of the incident, decided to give up his driving licence just weeks after the collision.\n\nExclusive data revealed by This is Money earlier this year showed that there were more than 113,000 Britons over the age of 90 who still retained a driving licence.\n\nAnd according to DVLA stats, at the end of May 2019 there were a total of 5.4 million motorists on the road in Britain who are over the age of 70.\n\nNine-decade-old licence holders: These are the 10 postcodes with the most drivers over the age of 90 (data based on figures for end of May 2019)\n\nTOP 10 POSTCODES WITH THE MOST DRIVERS OVER THE AGE OF 90 YEARS Postcode Area Name Postcode Area Total number of drivers in 90-99 age bracket Total number of drivers in 100+ age bracket Total number of drivers over 90 Number of licence holders in postcode % of licence holders in postcode Birmingham B 2,861 8 2,869 1,410,300 0.2 Brighton BN 2,346 11 2,357 641,279 0.4 Bournemouth BH 2,315 4 2,319 458,217 0.5 Norwich NR 2,213 7 2,220 577,514 0.4 Peterborough PE 2,210 7 2,217 727,937 0.3 Portsmouth PO 2,184 9 2,193 653,579 0.3 Guildford GU 2,059 7 2,066 632,856 0.3 Bristol BS 2,001 7 2,008 760,909 0.3 Tunbridge Wells TN 1,999 5 2,004 573,930 0.3 Exeter EX 1,907 5 1,912 454,456 0.4 Source: Hippo Leasing/DVLA, data accurate for end of May 2019\n\nWhile there's currently no age limit for driving in the UK, by law you must renew your driving licence when you turn 70 and every three years thereafter by filling out a free self-assessment from.\n\nThere is no requirement for drivers over 70 to sit a practical driving test to have their licence renewed.\n\nOn the form submitted motorists must also notify the DVLA if you have any medical conditions which could affect their driving, else face fines of up to \u00a31,000.\n\nHowever, new proposals put forward by the DfT will require all motorists over 70 to have an eye test every three years.\n\nThis is being suggested to \u2018identify drivers who pose a collision risk\u2019, with drivers who fail having their licences revoked.\n\nDfT stats show the rise in the number of over-60 fatalities and injuries in road accidents in 2018, along with the growing population in this age bracket\n\nSafety groups have previously said that there need to be much tighter restrictions on elderly drivers.\n\nA spokesperson for road safety charity Brake said that regulation around drivers' fitness to drive should be 'more rigorously enforced'.\n\nAA president Edmund King echoed calls for tougher measures, calling for evidence of regular eye tests for elderly drivers and stricter guidance from GPs.\n\nHowever, Caroline Abrahams, the charity director for Age UK, argued that elderly drivers are less likely to be involved in accidents than younger motorists and the threat of taking their licences away could hamper their quality of life.\n\n'For many older people, driving is crucial to maintaining independence so it's important that they should not be prevented from getting behind the wheel by their age alone,' she said.\n\nRoad deaths in Britain are still lower than most of EU\n\nBritain's roads are still among the safest in the world.\n\nIn fact, across Europe, only Switzerland and Norway has fewer road casualties per million inhabitants, the DfT pointed out.\n\nHowever, Lyes said this was no excuse for the lack of road safety improvement in recent years, adding: 'Historically, Great Britain has been proud of its road safety record, but these figures clearly show that is no room for complacency.'", "description": "The latest report on 2018 road casualties confirmed there were 1,784 deaths on UK roads -
