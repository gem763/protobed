This isn\u2019t a cable news channel anymore, it\u2019s a Democrat public relations firm.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the Ukrainian prosecutor in question, Viktor Shokin, was viewed by multiple international bodies and the Obama administration as deeply ineffective in fighting corruption. The U.S. embassy in 2016 suggested $1 billion in loan guarantees as a way to push the Ukrainian government to enforce stricter anti-corruption policies, including the removal of officials like Shokin.\n\nBiden publicly took credit for the idea\u2014as seen in the clips the Trump campaign now weaponizes in the ad\u2014but international organizations like the G7, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) all reportedly wanted Shokin ousted.\n\nThis is not the first time CNN has rejected a Trump ad from airing during its broadcasts. Several months into the Trump presidency, in May 2017, the network refused to air a spot titled \u201c100 Days,\u201d which targeted alleged \u201cfake news\u201d networks, including CNN, for not properly giving the president credit for \u201cmaking America great again.\u201d\n\n\u201cCNN requested that the advertiser remove the false graphic that says the mainstream media is \u2018fake news.\u2019 The mainstream media is not fake news, and therefore the ad is false,\u201d the network said at the time. \u201cPer our policy, it will be accepted only if that graphic is deleted.\u201d", "description": "The 30-second spot paints the president as a victim of Democrats and alleged \u201cmedia lapdogs\u201d like CNN.", "authors": ["Andrew Kirell", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1013,w_1800,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570114891/biden-ad-trump_k9ecmf"}
