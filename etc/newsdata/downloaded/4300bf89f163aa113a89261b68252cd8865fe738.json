Supporters on both sides charged the other with racism.\n\nLegal experts have said SFFA is likely to appeal, and the case is expected to eventually make its way up to the US supreme court, which would give its five-member conservative majority a chance to bar or more strictly limit the use of affirmative action to help minority applicants get into college.\n\nBurroughs ruled nearly a year after holding a non-jury trial.\n\nThe SFFA group that brought the case accused Harvard of going too far by engaging in \u201cracial balancing\u201d that limited Asian-Americans to no more than 20% of its incoming classes.\n\nThe group founded by a longtime affirmative action opponent, Edward Blum, argued that while Asian-Americans outperformed other groups on academic measures, stereotyping caused them to receive low scores on subjective \u201cpersonal\u201d ratings.\n\nHarvard denied that charge, saying that its use of race in admissions was legal, and was not a factor in the \u201cpersonal\u201d ratings.\n\nThe US Department of Justice sided with SFFA, saying Harvard had not seriously considered race-neutral approaches to admissions. It has also investigated whether another Ivy League school, Yale University, also discriminates against Asian Americans.", "description": "Judge rejects challenge accusing undergraduate admissions program of discrimination against Asian American applicants", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/128ea6f22e9d9c3a35e5128a4340d668e94fb853/102_0_4929_2957/master/4929.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a8391eb545dd04710d89491d146f2182", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
