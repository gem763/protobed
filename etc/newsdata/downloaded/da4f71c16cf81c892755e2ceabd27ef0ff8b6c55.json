And while we're at it - what exactly is a cyclone?\n\nAll tropical storms\n\nThey are all the same thing: tropical storms. But they are known by different names in different locations.\n\nIn the North Atlantic Ocean and Northeast Pacific, they are called hurricanes. But if the same type of disturbance takes place in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, it is known as a typhoon.\n\nAnd in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean, cyclone is the correct term.\n\nHow bad do storms have to be?\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Soldiers and emergency workers have been holding drills in readiness for Typhoon Mangkhut in the Philippines\n\nA tropical cyclone is a generic term used by meteorologists.\n\nIt means a rotating, organised system of clouds and thunderstorms that originates over tropical or subtropical waters, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the US.\n\n\"Once a tropical cyclone reaches maximum sustained winds of 74mph (119km/h) or higher, it is then classified as a hurricane, typhoon, or tropical cyclone, depending upon where the storm originates in the world.\"\n\nHurricanes are categorised between 1 to 5 based on their wind speed.\n\nWhen do they occur?\n\nIn the Atlantic, it is hurricane season between 1 June and 30 November. More than 95% of tropical cyclone activity occurs during this period in this region.\n\nTyphoons in the Northwest Pacific Ocean are most common from May to October, although they can form year-round.\n\nAnd in the South Pacific, it's cyclone season between November and April.\n\nHow are they named?\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization, a UN body, maintains a list to name tropical cyclones around the world.\n\nThe names of the deadliest ones like Typhoon Haiyan or Hurricane Katrina are retired and replaced.\n\nCountries in the regions of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones send suggestions for the list to the global met authority.\n\n\"Eight countries in our region, which covers the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, sent the list to the WMO during the early 2000s,\" a senior scientist with the Indian Meteorological Department told the BBC.\n\n\"Nearly 50% of those names for cyclones have been exhausted.\n\n\"The agreement between the countries in our region then was to make sure that the names do not hurt religious sentiment in our countries.\"\n\nThe science: How storms form\n\nAir rises quickly when it is heated by warm sea water.\n\nAs the air cools down again it is pushed aside by more warm air rising below it.\n\nThis cycle causes strong winds. Over the sea, a tropical storm can whip up huge waves.\n\nWhen these waves reach land they can flood large areas, including towns and cities.\n\nOver land the strong winds can cause a lot of damage - they can flatten homes, knock over trees and even tip over cars.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Mangkhut is forecast to strike northern part of Philippines on 14 September.\n\nScientists say the temperature of ocean water is going up and that can lead to hurricanes increasing in intensity in the future.\n\nThey add that a hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas.\n\nThere are many factors which make the relationship between climate change and hurricanes a complex one.", "description": "Why is Florence called a hurricane, while the storm approaching the Philippines is a super typhoon?", "authors": ["Navin Singh Khadka", "Environment Correspondent", "Bbc World Service"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CF3B/production/_103415035_florencefromspace.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-14"}
