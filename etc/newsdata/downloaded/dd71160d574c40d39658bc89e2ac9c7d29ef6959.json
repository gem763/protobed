And now several major space missions are being planned over the next decade to search for hints of life there.\n\nUnlike our neighbouring planets, some of the moons have plenty of liquid water. Jupiter\u2019s moon, Europa, for example, is thought to contain more liquid water than all of Earth's oceans combined. This water \u2013 and any life in it \u2013 is protected from space radiation and asteroid impacts by a thick layer of kilometers-deep surface ice.\n\nThe discovery of plumes of water shooting up from Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus and Europa have suggested they could have warm interiors that can support liquid oceans, heated not by the Sun, but by an internal dynamo powered by radioactive decay in their cores or by tidal heating generated by the gravitational attraction of the planets that they orbit.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nThere is now evidence for water oceans on several moons, including Europa, Enceladus, Callisto and Ganymede. One study published this June estimates that the Enceladus ocean is around one billion years old. Others have suggested it may be billions of years old \u2013 plenty of time for life to evolve.\n\nThese oceans are thought to be salty, containing sodium chloride, like Earth\u2019s oceans, which is another boost for the prospects of Earth-like life.\n\nAlso, there is likely to be an interface between the liquid water and the rocky mantle below the oceans \u2013 key ingredients for interesting chemistry that scientists think led to the origins of life on Earth. Nasa\u2019s Cassini mission, for example, detected molecules in Enceladus\u2019 water plumes that hint at the existence of hydrothermal vents on the moon\u2019s ocean floor.\n\nSimilar vents exist in the deep oceans of the Earth, where magma meets salt water and provides heat, chemicals and a substrate helpful for the complex chemistry some scientists think was needed for life to first evolve on our planet. Deep below the surface of Earth\u2019s ocean, there is practically no sunlight, as would be the case for oceans of Jupiter and Saturn\u2019s moons. But that doesn\u2019t mean there is no life. Indeed, on Earth, such vents are teeming with life.\n\nSome 20 years ago Natural History of an Alien, a BBC documentary, suggested that entire ecosystems could also be based around deep-sea thermal vents on Europa. A team of scientists suggested that bacteria would form the base of the food chain, using chemosynthesis to extract energy from the vents, and building tall tubes of deposits rising many miles above the ocean floor.\n\nEven on Earth, for some 90% of our planet\u2019s history the only life that existed here was microbial\n\nOther creatures, such as fish-like grazers would pierce those tubes to suck in large amounts of bacteria to feed on. They would be territorial, defending their grazing patches against rivals. And, in turn, they would be preyed upon by shark-like animals, streamlined for speed, using echolocation to detect their prey.\n\nThis is much more advanced than what most scientists expect to find there.\n\nEven on Earth, for some 90% of our planet\u2019s history, the only life that existed here was microbial, says Andrew Knoll, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at Harvard University. So, if there is life in space, chances are it\u2019s going to be microbial, Knoll says, and in places like Europa or Enceladus it would have to rely entirely on chemosynthesis for energy, so could probably only support a small biomass.\n\nBut such an ecosystem might still be possible, says Dimitar Sasselov, an astronomy professor and director of the Harvard Origins of Life Initiative, a centre supporting multi-disciplinary research to discover whether life is abundant in the universe. Just because Europa\u2019s ocean is cold and lacking in energy, doesn\u2019t necessarily rule out complex ecosystems of a smaller size evolving there.\n\n\u201cSpeculating is fun,\u201d Sasselov says. \u201cMy gut feeling is that there is a lot of evolutionary innovation space possible there where you can have something which is small and yet predatory and is a multicellular organism rather than just a single cell.\u201d\n\nAnother moon we\u2019re planning to visit presents a whole different puzzle.\n\nIf there is life, it would rely on methane, not water, and would be exotic \u2013 life as we don\u2019t know it\n\nSaturn\u2019s moon, Titan, is the only world beyond Earth known to have stable bodies of liquid on its surface. When the Huygens probe from the Cassini mission landed there in 2005, it sent back pictures of an Earth-like landscape: river beds and seas.\n\nBut rather than water, the clouds, rain and seas of Titan are made up of liquid methane and ethane, components of natural gas on Earth. Any water that does exist there is solidified into rocks and mountains because its surface temperature is around -180C (-292F).\n\nThis means that, while its landscape might look familiar, the actual conditions are totally alien. If there is life, it would rely on methane, not water, and would be exotic \u2013 life as we don\u2019t know it. True aliens.\n\nIt is possible and plausible that life exists on Titan, but with a \u201ccompletely different, independent biochemistry\u201d, says Sasselov, whose long-term goal is to figure out if there is an alternative biochemistry and how to create it in the lab.\n\nLife on Earth depends on cell membranes made of phospholipids: molecular chains with phosphorus-oxygen heads and carbon-chain tails that bind to each other to form a flexible membrane in water.\n\nMethane-based life would need an alternative way to form cells.\n\nA Cornell University team led by chemical engineer Paulette Clancy showed in 2015 that small molecules made from nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen could build cells fit to survive in Titan\u2019s conditions.\n\nSince then, Nasa researchers have confirmed the presence of vinyl cyanide in Titan\u2019s atmosphere, an organic compound that could provide such cellular membranes. So, at least in theory, cells that could form a very different life in Titan\u2019s vast methane oceans could physically exist there.\n\nWe really don\u2019t know what are the limits of life - David Charbonneau\n\n\u201cIn some respects, what we see here on Earth is a matter of chance,\u201d says Theresa Fisher, astrobiologist at Arizona State University, US. There\u2019s an \u201cenormous amount of potential variety\u201d that we could see in life on other worlds, she says.\n\n\"There might emerge a fluorescence of new and very diverse organisms occupying a range of new niches,\u201d adds Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, a professor emerita in anthropology at the University of California, Davis. \"Assuming any of these creatures evolve to be as social, intelligent and communicative as say cetaceans or elephants, and as manipulative, dexterous and clever as chimpanzees or orangutans, I see no reason why they could not eventually evolve more sophisticated technological and cultural capacities.\u201d\n\nLauren Sallan, a palaeontologist at the University of Pennsylvania, thinks alien life will be microbial \u2013 and there\u2019re only so many ways to be a microbe.\n\nAs far as multicellular aliens are concerned, she says, things may get more complicated. \u201cWe would recognise that they\u2019re doing the same kind of jobs because everything is focused on either taking in energy or consuming things to get energy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the way that they go about it would be pretty unpredictable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t know what are the limits of life,\u201d says David Charbonneau, professor of astronomy at Harvard University, who adds that this is why we need to send more probes to examine the moons.\n\nSo, it\u2019s good news that there are plans to do just that.\n\nNasa announced this summer that its Dragonfly mission will launch in 2026 and arrive on Titan in 2034. It will land a drone-like craft to explore dozens of promising locations and look for signs of life.\n\nNasa is also exploring the possibility of sending an autonomous submarine to study Titan\u2019s largest northern sea, Kraken Mare, which is some 1,000 km (621 miles) wide, with depths estimated at 300m (1,000ft), similar in size to North America\u2019s Great Lakes. This would be the first opportunity to explore a sea on another world, and it could inform the design of future submarines to explore the subsurface waters of Europa and other moons. The mission is still in its conceptual stage, some 20 years away, with scientists and engineers starting to investigate how to even build such a submarine.\n\nBut to really figure out what life might exist in these alien oceans, we will need to send a submersible\n\nIntriguingly, Titan is also thought to have a liquid ocean of water deep beneath its icy outer layer, which would mean that in addition to its exotic surface life based on liquid methane, there could exist more Earth-like life under its surface.\n\nAnother possibility for layers of different types of life on a single world is Ganymede, Jupiter\u2019s moon. Some scientists think this moon has several different layers of ocean, separated by different types of ice that form at different depths and pressures. If this is the case, each layer could, in theory, host different lifeforms adapted to local conditions at that depth.\n\nGanymede is set for a visit by the European Space Agency\u2019s 2022 Juice mission, which will also visit two of Jupiter\u2019s other moons \u2013 Callisto and Europa \u2013 to study their habitability and look for signatures of life.\n\nMeanwhile, Nasa\u2019s Europa Clipper is planning to orbit Jupiter and fly past Europa multiple times to investigate whether it could harbour conditions suitable for life, with a take-off date of 2023. Nasa is also discussing sending a lander to Europa, as early as 2025.\n\nAnd, there is a private, Nasa-backed plan for a mission to Enceladus to look for life there that could take off in 2025 if it gets the green light later this year.\n\nBut to really figure out what life might exist in these alien oceans, we will need to send a submersible, which will be tricky as such a vehicle would have to drill through several kilometres of ice to even reach the ocean. Nasa is funding some conceptual studies on how to do that.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible there simply isn\u2019t any life there yet\n\nOne concept, for a nuclear-powered \u201ctunnelbot\u201d to search for life on Europa, was presented at a 2018 meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Washington DC, by scientists at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Nasa. Their bot would sample ice and water as it descended, sending information back to the surface through a fibre optic cable.\n\nBut, if lifeforms there turn out to be truly alien, we might struggle to detect them. It\u2019s also possible there simply isn\u2019t any life there yet.\n\nIn the distant future, though, some five billion years from now, when our Sun runs out of hydrogen fuel and starts expanding into a red giant phase before it eventually dies, it will melt the ice on these moons and turn them into much more Earth-like places. There should be liquid water on their surface and more temperate climates, perhaps opening up the possibility of life evolving there then \u2013 or at least harbouring refugees from the scorched Earth.\n\nIn the distant future, if we are to survive, we will all have to become migrants and hope these newly habitable worlds welcome us as our own world gets too hot for life.\n\n--\n\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cThe Essential List\u201d.
