In contrast with Panama, Argentina eventually mounted thorough, though troubled, investigations of the AIMA attack and a 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. These exposed for the first time the extent of Iranian-Hezbollah projection of power into the Western Hemisphere and its operating methods via clandestine support cells, local expatriate sympathizers, and Iranian embassies used for diplomatic cover.\n\nBut months of requests by the authors of this report for an update on the Panamanian investigation\u2019s progress ran into an apparent determination to not speak of it, either on or off the record, with or without attribution. After a January 2019 report by Todd Bensman from Panama casting initial doubt that the promised investigation got underway, the Middle East Forum funded additional reporting efforts by the Spanish-speaking Uruguayan-Israeli journalist Jana Beris, who continued to seek confirmation in Israel and in Panama through the summer of 2019.\n\nBut neither journalist could obtain any such confirmation from any quarter during continuing 2019 reporting efforts, to include government channels in both countries in addition to Panama\u2019s Jewish community, local journalists, and elected political party leaders.\n\nWhat is all but confirmed instead is that the promised investigation was never launched.\n\n\u201cI think silence, both from the Israeli and Panamanian side, is the message,\u201d Beris observed after her effort.\n\nThe questions now become, does it matter? And if so, why?\n\nPresident Varela left office in July due to constitutional term limitations, his administration rebuffing repeated requests for confirmation that an investigation was ever started and, if it did, how it was progressing.\n\nPanama\u2019s small Jewish community of 15,000, which has long nursed its wound from Flight 901 in private, has messaged newly seated Panamanian president, Laurentino \u201cNito\u201d Cortizo, that it remains interested in having the investigation. While Panamanian officials of the outgoing Varela government did not provide answers to numerous inquiries from September 2018 through the time they left office July 1, it appeared too early for the incoming new government to do so. Varela's ambassador to Israel noted in late August, for instance, that a new Attorney General had not yet been appointed, who once seated, could eventually respond to questions about Flight 901.\n\nFor now, the only small recompense with which Jewish leaders are left is to work with a national committee to build a Flight 901 memorial. It also now feels it has the top cover, finally, to speak publicly of the loss in terms rarely used before Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s 2018 intelligence gift.\n\n\u201cOur fallen did not die,\u201d declared David Djemal, president of the Anti-Defamation Commission of B\u2019nai B\u2019rith Panama, at a public remembrance ceremony of the bombing\u2019s 25th anniversary on July 18.\n\n\u201cThey were killed.\u201d\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Flight 901 and a Promise\n\nTwelve of 19 passengers on board Alas Chiricanas Airlines Flight 901 were leading Jewish business leaders. All aboard, including three crew members, died when the aircraft exploded shortly after takeoff from Enrique Jimenez airport in the Caribbean port of Colon on the short commuter shuttle to Panama City. No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, or for the AMIA bombing the day before in Argentina. For a time, the FBI investigated but soon ran so short of leads that it turned to the public for help.\n\nAccording to a July 1994 FBI call for public leads, all of the deceased passengers and crew were claimed except for one body \u201cpossibly\u201d identified as Ali Hawa Jamal, who was suspected of carrying a bomb aboard the aircraft.\n\nAt the time, the FBI believed Jamal was with a support team of \u201cunknown Middle Eastern males\u201d from Lebanon linked to South American weapons traffickers and who, with a stolen American credit card some six weeks before the bombing, financed vehicle rentals and the purchase of a Motorola two-way radio communications device that Jamal had on the flight. The vehicles were later found abandoned near Tocumen Airport in Panama City.\n\nThe FBI thought the attack was linked to \u201ca terrorist group or terrorist groups\u201d following the extremist ideology of Ansar Allah, a violent Shia extremist movement rooted in Sidon, Lebanon and Houthi tribes in Yemen, which still hold financial, operational and ideological links to Hezbollah and Iran. But that\u2019s as far as any investigation went. A competing theory held that drug cartels in neighboring Colombia, which had used similar tactics to eliminate rivals or debtors, might have contracted the job out to eliminate perceived enemies aboard the flight.\n\nThe mystery of Flight 901 was left in that stasis until the Israeli prime minister sent a private November 2017 letter to President Varela outlining Israeli intelligence information ahead of a planned state visit by Varela to Israel scheduled for May 2018. After the state visit, both leaders publicly revealed that Israel\u2019s new information had all but solved the bombing. It was a Hezbollah terror attack just like the Argentina attacks, they both indicated at a joint press briefing during that visit.\n\n\u201cThank you for that information, which I shared with the families,\u201d the Panamanian president told Netanyahu. \u201cAnd I will keep following that case, to make sure that justice is done.\u201d\n\nLater in Panama, Varela told local reporters he would ask local and international authorities to reopen the investigation \u201cgiven intelligence reports that clearly show it was a terrorist attack.\u201d\n\nWhy Panama Might Have Changed Course\n\nClues as to why Panama has so mysteriously chosen a path other than the one promised lay in the Argentine experience following its 1992 and 1994 terrorist bombing attacks. Both attacks are thought to have been ordered to avenge the February 1992 Israeli assassination by Apache attack helicopters of Sheik Abbas Musawi, Hezbollah\u2019s internally beloved secretary-general, who had orchestrated a sharp increase in deadly cross-border attacks on Israel, according to the book \u201cLightning Out of Lebanon\u201d by journalists Tom Diaz and Barbara Newman.\n\nFor years after the 1992 and 1994 attacks, early and later investigations were tormented by diplomatic influence campaigns carried out by Iran and its allies from outside Argentina, and also from inside by powerful political Middle East diaspora communities. The pressure was relentless on those first early investigations, leading to abusive political interferences to steer outcomes away from Iran or its local sympathizers. These government disruption efforts came amid suddenly soaring new trade deals with Iran worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Argentina.\n\nBy 2009, government corruption investigations related to the Iranian trade deals and political interference led to charges against former President Carlos Menem, who was of Syrian descent, and 13 senior government officials that they had systematically interfered with those early investigations to protect local Arab community members thought to have participated in the bombings. The initial investigations in Argentina produced widely ridiculed and patently improbable conclusions that had to be thrown out.\n\nNew investigations were started \u2013 and those, too, were followed by political interference from new Argentinian political leaders.\n\nIn 2007, special prosecutor Alberto Nisman finally brought a 900-page indictment to Interpol, the global law enforcement organization, which granted red notice warrants for some of Iran\u2019s highest-ranking officials.\n\nGovernment obstructionism, fueled by Iranian and European pressures, led to new corruption investigations. In 2015, Nisman was murdered hours before he was to publicly present evidence that President Christina de Kirchner and Iran had conspired to shut down his investigations to cinch a new Iranian grain-for-oil deal. In 2017, on the strength of the murdered Nisman\u2019s corruption probe, she was indicted for treason related to her alleged participation in the conspiracy with Iran, which has long denied involvement in corrupting Argentine government officials or in participating in the bombings.\n\nSo why not Panama?\n\nLucrative Iranian trade deals. Diplomatic pressure campaigning by Iran. Internal pressure from powerful Arab diaspora communities whose members helped with the attacks. Massive payoffs to government officials. Two indicted former presidents. A murdered special prosecutor.\n\nBack in Panama, of course, there is no hint that any such oppositional activities occurred after President Varela issued a promise that made international headlines. However, it would not be hard to imagine that Iran, influential allies such as Russia, and Panama\u2019s Lebanese business community also might have applied the same tactics to persuade Panamanian leaders to kill an embryonic investigation into who ordered and carried out the destruction of Flight 901, and why. Panama\u2019s expatriate population of some 9,000 or 10,000 citizens of Lebanese descent are said to be successful in business and influential in government. It may not want to know more about the \u201cunknown Middle Eastern\u201d men the FBI said had rented trucks and bought a Motorola radio for the Flight 901 bomber.\n\nBut even absent an Argentina-style influence campaign for the Panamanian government to ice the promised investigation, it\u2019s also quite possible the government merely looked at Argentina\u2019s 20-year-long train wreck and decided, quite on its own, not to expose the small country to a similarly traumatic experience.\n\nAs for Israel\u2019s uncharacteristic silence about a chance to damage the Hezbollah brand, the restraint can be reasonably explained as an exercise is diplomatic deference to a sensitive situation for an allied nation.\n\n\u2018We are close to you; how close you wouldn\u2019t know\u2019: Why a Panama investigation matters\n\nThe evident failure to seize an investigative opportunity offered by Flight 901 matters in ways that are material to current United States foreign security policy and to a global effort among nations to counter nefarious activities by Hezbollah and Iran. Consider the largely unacknowledged ways that Argentina\u2019s investigation has been used to expand knowledge of Hezbollah-Iran operations in South America and informed the U.S. ability to disrupt them there.\n\nJoseph Humire, Executive Director of the Center for a Secure and Free Society and an expert on Latin American security affairs, said Nisman\u2019s final report on the Buenos Aires bombings has withstood the test of time and retained a high value to the rest of the world, even though no one has yet to be brought to justice.\n\n\u201cFor anyone who wants to understand how Hezbollah and Iran operate in Latin America, that\u2019s the blueprint,\u201d Humire said of the Nisman investigation in a telephone interview from the tri-border region of Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil, where he was attending a security conference partly about Hezbollah\u2019s footprint in the region.\n\nWhile none of those indicted have been arrested or brought to justice, these investigations into long-ago 1990s terrorist acts matter today. Just last month, on the anniversary of the 1994 AIMA bombing, the Nisman report was cited as justification for Argentina to formally designate Hezbollah a terrorist organization. The designation enables Argentina to lawfully attack Hezbollah\u2019s South American operations alongside the United States.\n\nAnd that was just the most recent action to grow from Argentina\u2019s Hezbollah investigations. The U.S. State Department in 2017 issued a report explicitly crediting Argentina\u2019s Iran-Hezbollah investigations with prompting counterterrorism penal system reforms, new approaches to combating terrorism financing and a modernization of security and intelligence capabilities. These are being applied in Argentina\u2019s lawless hinterlands and ungoverned parts of neighboring countries where Hezbollah\u2019s criminal enterprises are concentrated. U.S. State Department reporting say the group derives significant strength from the drugs and weapons trade in many South American countries such as Venezuela, Peru, and Bolivia.\n\nBut what of Central America, much closer to the United States? The shuttering of a Panama investigation means the loss of a rare opportunity to expand knowledge about Iran and Hezbollah even closer to America\u2019s southern gate, where it may well involve different groups of supporters, means and methods, and criminal activity preferences.\n\nThis is not a stale matter of 1990s circumstances; in about 2007, Iran established itself firmly in Nicaragua, with almost no media interest or public reporting as to its regional activities in the years since. As well, current New York and Michigan prosecutions of Hezbollah\u2019s intelligence wing in the United States recently revealed that an intelligence operative was tracked as recently as 2011 and 2012 to Panama, where he collected information on targets such as Panama Canal shipping and successfully delivered it back to handlers in Lebanon, where it still obviously resides.\n\nBy contrast with Argentina\u2019s Nisman-inspired new counterterror laws and efforts, Panama failed even to pass an anti-terrorism statute as proposed in 2015.\n\nAt a time when U.S.-demanded global economic sanctions against Iran have led to saber-rattling, seized oil tankers, and shot down drones, the opportunity costs of shuttering the Flight 901 investigation should not be allowed to pass in silence, without notice or discussion.\n\nA case in point for the need to know more about Hezbollah-Iran in Central America came last summer when Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps General Ghasem Soleimani warned President Trump after a testy exchange: \u201cMr. Gambler, Trump! I\u2019m telling you that we are close to you, exactly where, you wouldn\u2019t think that we are.\u201d\n\nJournalist Jana Beris in Israel contributed to this report.\n\nTodd Bensman reported from Panama in December 2018.", "description": "In May 2018, Panamanian President Juan Varela issued a public .09/03/2019 19:41:13PM EST.", "authors": ["Todd Bensman", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/310/6a691b1e-f157-436f-acea-a65e8456a3e6.jpg"}
