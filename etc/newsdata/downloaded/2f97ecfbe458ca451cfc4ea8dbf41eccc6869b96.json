But the four-time All-Pro immediately was ruled out with a foot ailment that turned out to be frostbite from a cryochamber. Even once his feet healed, Brown rarely saw the field as he sat out because of multiple grievances with the NFL over the league's new helmet policy requiring him to wear a helmet that actually would protect his brain from the trauma inflicted on it while on the field.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter Brown missed walk-throughs and practices over the helmet issue, Raiders general manager Mike Mayock issued several fines to the receiver, causing him to confront Mayock at practice in a heated altercation in which Brown reportedly called Mayock a \"cracker\" and threatened to punch him.\n\nDays later, Brown took to Instagram after another fine that voided the guaranteed money in his contract.\n\n[RELATED: Rumors: AB wants to return after NFL investigation]\n\nThe Raiders capitulated, and Brown signed on with the Patriots and played one game for them before being released amidst sexual assault allegations.
