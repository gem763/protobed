They carried banners with slogans including \u201cClimate change denies our children a future unless we act now\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here because the government is not doing enough on the climate emergency,\u201d protester Lizzy Mansfield said. \u201cWe only get one planet and so we\u2019re here to try and defend it.\u201d\n\nPolice chiefs said last week they would mobilize thousands of officers to handle the protests in London and that anyone who broke the law, even as part of non-violent civil disobedience, would be arrested.\n\nOn Saturday, officers used a battering ram to enter a building in south London where activists had been storing materials to use during the protests. Eight people were arrested during the raid.\n\n\u201cOUT OF TIME\u201d\n\nDefying almost freezing temperatures in Berlin, activists singing \u201cSolid as a rock, rooted as a tree\u201d gathered at dawn at the Victory Column roundabout near Tiergarten park.\n\nAt sunrise, some were sleeping in insulated bags in the middle of the roundabout as police on motorbikes drove by. No arrests were made and the protest remained peaceful.\n\nPolice blocked the five avenues that converge on the roundabout to stop cars and buses reaching the demonstration, as this would have resulted in traffic chaos during rush hour.\n\nClimate change activists protest at the Wall Street Bull in Lower Manhattan during Extinction Rebellion protests in New York City, New York, U.S., October 7, 2019. REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nBy midday, the protest had swelled to 4,000 people, a policeman said, and a second main roundabout was also blocked by activists sitting in the middle of the road.\n\nPolice began removing chanting protesters from Berlin\u2019s Potsdamer Platz later in the day after they had occupied the central artery for much of the day, singing, making speeches and fashioning a makeshift camp out of salvaged armchairs and tents.\n\nThe rallies came as German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended climate protection measures her government is due to approve on Wednesday but which critics have condemned as unambitious.\n\nIn Amsterdam, police were lining up empty city buses to take the arrested demonstrators away as they tried to clear a major thoroughfare in the afternoon.\n\n\u201cThe climate crisis is not being taken seriously enough by politics, and also not by the companies. That\u2019s why I joined,\u201d said one demonstrator, who gave his name as Christiaan.\n\nMeanwhile activists in London, some wearing yellow safety helmets with \u201cRebel at Work\u201d painted on the side, glued or chained themselves to cars parked in the middle of roads or to street lamps, making it hard for police officers to detain them.\n\n\u201cWe are out of time, there is none left, we have to act now,\u201d said a protester called Benjamin.\n\nIn central Paris, dozens of Extinction Rebellion activists blocked a street and bridge in the Chatelet district. They also built temporary shelters or held impromptu concerts and workshops in a good-natured atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly non-violent, it is human, we are not here with guns, we are here as human beings,\u201d protester Francoise Loiseau said.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nWith events like extreme weather, thawing permafrost and a sea-level rise unfolding much faster than expected, scientists say the urgency of the climate crisis has intensified since the signing in 2015 of the Paris accord on curbing global warming.\n\nNearly 70 countries announced plans at a U.N. climate action summit last month to beef up their Paris pledges, but most major economies including the United States and China failed to announce stronger new measures.", "description": "Thousands of climate-change protesters took to the streets in cities around the world on Monday, launching two weeks of peaceful civil disobedience to demand immediate action to cut carbon emissions and avert an ecological disaster.", "authors": ["Peter Nicholls", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438118673&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9617H", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
