What do you think you\u2019re doing?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother hurdle is the risk of violence.\n\nPreventing teachers (of both sexes) from using violence against children requires careful and effective vetting, training and monitoring.\n\nGood practice includes a clear code of conduct, having more than one adult present with children at all times and encouraging a culture in which children feel safe to talk about their experiences, with adults taking children\u2019s reports seriously.\n\nChanging norms\n\nEncouraging more men to become active in ECD requires a systematically implemented and monitored approach.\n\nBalungile appreciated the fact that SmartStart did not recruit for \u201cday mothers\u201d, but for carers.\n\nSome of the parents were not apprehensive in leaving their children with a male carer.\n\nIn fact, when they arrived with their children, none of them seemed apprehensive; they came, paid and dropped off the children.\n\nThey feel they are leaving the child with the \u201cday father\u201d.\n\nToy libraries are a good place to get men started, as Bonga mentioned: \u201cMainly for men, it\u2019s the best way to start. You get to engage with children in a playful manner. Men typically gravitate to playing with children. Working with toys presents an opportunity that may be more appealing to men than starting in a more formal educational role.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to acknowledge that an adult\u2019s engagement with children can be gender biased.\n\nA structured gender socialisation programme will allow teachers to better understand gender and socialisation, and acquire a more progressive stance.\n\nBalungile recalls: \u201cMy child\u2019s mother had to return to work. It was tough \u2026 I would ask women in the neighbourhood to help me change nappies, but, as time went on, I decided this was something I could do myself.\u201d\n\nSome men also help to normalise men\u2019s care work in the surrounding community, as indicated by Bonga: \u201cWe can break this barrier of men not being trusted, especially with the young guys who are the fathers of tomorrow. Whenever we have an event or a parents\u2019 meeting, it saddens me when I see that maybe only one or two men are there, but it\u2019s a start. It teaches other men ... they want to know what we are doing; how are we doing it.\u201d\n\nWe can break this barrier of men not being trusted, especially with the young guys who are the fathers of tomorrow.\n\n\u2018I love the feeling of keeping them safe\u2019\n\nThe work of investing in ways to get men more engaged in the care of children extends beyond the household, and can be achieved in institutional settings by deliberately focusing on recruiting men as ECD practitioners.\n\nIn the context of grotesque violence perpetrated by men against women and children, these men strike a powerful contrast in their earnestness to protect children.\n\nPhilani says: \u201cI love the feeling of keeping them safe. They are safe in front of me. I am responsible for shaping these children so that they can live good lives.\u201d\n\nGlobal evidence shows that short-term interventions to shift cultures of patriarchy have little effect because gender norms are already fixed by early adolescence.\n\nEmbedding gender-transformative norms requires a prolonged inter-generational project aimed at shaping new identities for young children and teenagers.\n\nThe presence of male ECD practitioners, therefore, not only has the power to shape the lives of the children in their care, it has the potential to reshape subsequent generations \u2013 and their attitudes towards the roles and traits that men can possess.\n\nAs more men enter the ECD space, we have a greater chance of making it normal for men to be carers, protectors and promoters of gender equality.\n\nVan den Berg is a father.
