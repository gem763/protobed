Commentators on television warn of \u201criots\u201d. Inflammatory language is increasingly the norm in public life. Yet one word remains muffled under a curious omerta. BBC presenter Naga Munchetty was only the latest to discover that describing something as \u201cracist\u201d, even in a measured way, can get you into a lot of trouble.\n\nFor many people of colour in largely white institutions, this is a familiar prohibition that works to shut down much-needed discussion and create a repressive and demoralising silence.\n\nRacism is that strange phenomenon, apparent everywhere and apparently nowhere. People believe that not \u201cseeing\u201d race or being \u201ccolour-blind\u201d is progressive when it is merely evasive. What might happen if we took as given that, after six centuries of global European imperial rule, it would be astounding if most of us \u2013 including people of colour \u2013 were not shaped by the racial hierarchies put in place? The term \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d may invoke images of hooded Klansmen burning crosses but it actually refers to an entrenched system of racial domination which once justified colonisation and slavery, the legacies of which still shape economic, political and social orders, particularly in the west.\n\nFar right swooping on towns to exploit tensions, report says Read more\n\nRacism is emphatically not a matter of subjective \u201cexperience\u201d. It has objective structural force that can be identified not just in discriminatory practices but differing entitlements and unequal access to resources, representation and opportunities. \u201cGo back to where you came from\u201d is not just a wounding phrase that almost all people of colour and migrants have heard. Its material consequences include actual expulsions such as those of the \u201cWindrush children\u201d and, of course, discriminatory travel, migration and citizenship policies.\n\nAnother way of deflecting engagement with race is to personalise matters. As the sociologist Robin DiAngelo notes, insisting that there was no \u201cintent\u201d to be racist or asking, \u201chow can you say I\u2019m racist, you don\u2019t know me\u201d, are manifestations of \u201cwhite fragility\u201d. In this scheme, only exceptionally \u201cbad\u201d people can be racist and therefore the mere suggestion of racism is often treated as more serious and hurtful than racism itself. DiAngelo makes the important point that discussions about race are bound to be uncomfortable for members of dominant communities who have to come to terms with their own entanglement in an unfair system.\n\nTo avoid such discomfort and difficulty is to refuse change. I know this from personal experience as an upper-caste woman from India who has also benefited from a deeply iniquitous caste system. I too have felt defensive, but there\u2019s no way to change things without admitting to the existence of caste or race supremacy \u2013 and dealing with the fact of inevitable complicity and the inherited privilege that disadvantages others.\n\nPlay Video 2:18 Toni Morrison's powerful words on racism - video\n\nAt the same time, \u201cwhataboutery\u201d leads nowhere. Whenever I speak of race and empire in the British media, I receive emails asking \u201cwhat about caste\u201d and inviting me to \u201cgo back\u201d to India to address the caste system instead. People not normally known for a deep interest in class matters will suddenly ask \u201cwhat about the working classes?\u201d A now retired female manager once told me that, although sexism was still an issue at Cambridge University, racism was not. There\u2019s no need to pit race, class, caste, gender, ability or sexuality against each other: there are no free passes in an inequitable world where each brutality shapes the others.\n\nThere are also no \u201crace cards\u201d. People who raise issues of racial exclusion or abuse are not demanding special treatment; on the contrary, they are arguing against the special privileges bestowed on the majority or dominant group. Most of us who raise issues of racism do so with hesitation, feeling vulnerable as we do so, and fearing inevitable social and institutional reprisals. Meet a race whistleblower and you meet a deemed \u201ctroublemaker\u201d, a position with unpleasant institutional consequences.\n\nDiscussion of race is often derailed by bogeys such as \u201creverse racism\u201d. Of course it\u2019s possible for people of colour to display hostile or denigrating attitudes towards other races, Asian anti-blackness being one example. \u201cRacism towards white people\u201d is not, however, systemic and does not have policy consequences. Certificates from \u201cbest friends\u201d of colour declaring a person to be \u201cnot racist\u201d are also void. Just as a having a mother does not make men free of sexism in a patriarchal world, having a black best friend, spouse or even child cannot absolve individuals from complicity in racist language and actions. Indeed, ethnic minority politicians may themselves be used to justify such things as blackface or xenophobia.\n\nNo one is claiming that victims of racism are pure or noble. People are never purely victims and everyone has to ask tough questions of themselves. It is perfectly possible, for example, to be at once homophobic yourself and a victim of racism. Both must be tackled.\n\nFar from \u201cwallowing in victimhood\u201d, people who challenge racism are acting as responsible agents of change. At a time when the forces of violent racism are globally in the ascendant once again, we can help them along by refusing to name it as such.\n\nAlternatively, we can do the right thing: actively acknowledge racism\u2019s existence and try to rein in its power. If we don\u2019t choose to have difficult and urgent discussions openly, then \u201cdiversity\u201d will remain a meaningless buzzword where people\u2019s bodies are included in institutions but their voices silenced.\n\n\u2022 Priyamvada Gopal is the author of Insurgent Empire: Anticolonial Resistance and British Dissent", "description": "As Naga Munchetty\u2019s experience shows, challenging inflammatory language can be hazardous, says author Priyamvada Gopal", "authors": ["Priyamvada Gopal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/553f670cb3c3036a8c9c320d7953fac418d46e1f/0_332_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ffa01e2908787fb97ab2682261a9d456", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
