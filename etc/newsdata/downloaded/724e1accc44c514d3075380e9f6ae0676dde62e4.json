Here's how auto-brewery syndrome works", "language": "en", "text": "Free beer: Great. Beer that ferments inside your stomach without you knowing why you're getting drunk: Not so great.\n\nIn a case study published in the peer-reviewed British Medical Journal Open Gastroenterology, doctors describe a patient who repeatedly had elevated blood alcohol levels but denied ever drinking a drop.\n\nThe cause: a rare condition known as \"auto-brewery syndrome,\" or ABS, which causes the carbohydrates one ingests to turn into alcohol, fermented by fungi or bacteria in the gastrointestinal system.\n\n\"ABS is probably an underdiagnosed condition,\" the study authors wrote, adding that no diagnostic criteria exists to confirm the syndrome or treat it. However, the researchers do propose treatment that could be tested in future studies.\n\nHere's what to know about the unusual condition.\n\nCase study: How a man got drunk without taking a drink\n\nThe unnamed 46-year-old man in the BMJ case study, published in August, was otherwise healthy and had no other major medical condition before January 2011, when he began experiencing memory loss, mental changes and episodes of depression.\n\nThe changes occurred after he began taking antibiotics for a traumatic thumb injury, and after he completed the 3-week antibiotic course, he reported an uncharacteristic depression, \"brain fog\" and aggression.\n\nYears later, he was arrested one morning on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. The man was hospitalized, and had a blood alcohol level of 0.2 g/dL, well above the legal limit of 0.08. Despite police and hospital staff not believing him, the man maintained he never had a drink that day, the case study says.\n\n\"He was unable to function and (symptoms appeared) mainly after meals,\" Dr. Fahad Malik, study author, told TODAY.com. \"No one believed him.\"\n\nThe man had heard of similar cases and went to a doctor in Ohio, who confirmed that in his stool were two similar yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or \"brewer\u2019s yeast,\" and S. boulardii.\n\nDoctors diagnosed him with ABS by giving him a carbohydrate meal then measuring his blood alcohol levels, which reached .05 g/dL within eight hours.\n\nHe was prescribed an anti-fungal treatment for a few weeks and was told to steer clear of carbs in his diet. But soon, the symptoms returned, and more doctors were stumped.\n\nThe problem got so bad that he fell and suffered a brain bleed that required he be admitted to the hospital. There, his blood alcohol levels ranged from .05 to .4 g/dL, and again, medical staff didn't believe he wasn't drinking.\n\nThe man then sought out the doctors who wrote the case study. The doctors found other yeasts in his system, including Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis, and prescribed further anti-fungal treatment, but the man had a meal of pizza with soda that caused a severe relapse.\n\nThe doctors then gave him an IV micafungin treatment for six weeks that eventually cleared out all the fungus. He then began taking a probiotic to stifle fungal growth. Soon, doctors were able to slowly introduce carbs back into his diet, and a year-and-a-half later while continually taking the probiotic, symptoms have not returned.\n\nWhat causes auto-brewery syndrome?\n\nThe study authors believe the initial antibiotic treatment sparked the patient's ABS. When the man took the medication after his thumb injury, it changed his \"gastrointestinal microbiome allowing fungal overgrowth,\" the say.\n\nAccording to NPR, other cases of antibiotics clearing out gut bacteria and allowing for yeast to grow have been documented.\n\nOther cases had been documented in people who had weakened immune systems or complications from surgery or Crohn\u2019s disease, the study says.\n\nYeasts from the Candida and Saccharomyces families are able to produce endogenous ethanol within a patients' gut, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information.\n\nBut how do people function with such high levels of alcohol?\n\nThat's part of what makes ABS so hard to understand. While the cases have shown patients suffering from the intoxication, other instances show them functioning normally.\n\n\"I'm in touch with about 30 people who believe they have this same syndrome, about 10 of them are diagnosed with it,\" Panola College Dean of Nursing Barbara Cordell told CNN in 2016.", "description": "In a case study published in the British Medical Journal, doctors say a patient had elevated blood alcohol levels but denied ever drinking a drop.", "authors": ["Ryan W.
