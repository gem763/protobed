The church has a congregation of 15,000.\n\n\u201cHe was vibrant, positive, and was always serving and helping others,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe wanted to especially help those who were dealing with suicidal thoughts.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes people may think that as pastors or spiritual leaders we are somehow above the pain and struggles of everyday people,\u201d the church\u2019s senior pastor Greg Laurie wrote in a blog post mourning Harris\u2019s death on Tuesday. \u201cWe are the ones who are supposed to have all the answers. But we do not.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

You are made complete and you are finally free. Suicide and depression fed you the worst lies, but you knew the truth of Jesus and I know you\u2019re by his side right this very second,\u201d her post read.\n\nWilson and his wife were the founders of an outreach program called \u201cAnthem of Hope,\u201d which set out to help people dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nIn a 2017 podcast interview with ChurchLeaders.com, Wilson cited the Bible\u2019s Book of Job, arging that \u201cSome of God\u2019s brightest saints dealt with the darkest of depression. What we have to understand is that just because you\u2019re dealing with depression or suicidal thoughts does not mean you\u2019re any less of a believer or a Christian than anybody else.\u201d And in a column written a year later for the site, he wrestled further with scriptural precedent and the stigma many place upon suicide and suicidal thoughts or ideation. Such judgments, Harris wrote, \u201cill-thought and without proper biblical understanding\u2026 [they] obviously don\u2019t understand the totality of mental health issues in today\u2019s world, let alone understand the basic theology behind compassion and God\u2019s all-consuming grace.\u201d He continued:\n\nDoes God approve of suicide? Nope!\n\nDoes God view suicide as a bad thing? Yup!\n\nIs God\u2019s grace sufficient even for those who have committed suicide? Yup!\n\nThe day before his death, Wilson tweeted that faith couldn\u2019t always be seen as a \u201ccure\u201d but added that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean Jesus doesn\u2019t offer us companionship and comfort. He ALWAYS does that.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know may be contemplating suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or text HOME to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line.
