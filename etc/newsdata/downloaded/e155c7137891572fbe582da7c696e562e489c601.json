But to Stephen James, visibly moved as Elton\u2019s words are read to him, it means the world \u2013 an apology of sorts over the star\u2019s very public fall-out with his late father.\n\nStephen is the son of music publishing mogul Dick James, who first signed Elton when he was an \u201cawkward, shy, shaking\u201d kid aged just 20.\n\nHe was also a father figure to the young Reg Dwight, who had a strained relationship with his own distant dad \u2013 the confidant he turned to as he struggled to come to terms with his sexuality.\n\nYet in 1985, Elton took him to court in a dispute over rights and royalties.\n\nIn the book Elton says he \u201chated every minute\u201d of the case, but felt he had to go ahead because \u201cthe industry had to change the way it treated artists\u201d.\n\nDespite Dick\u2019s attempts to reach out, Stephen says Elton would not personally discuss his gripes, and once, he claims, cancelled a meeting just a few minutes before it was due to start.\n\nThe result of the case was mixed, and the financial hit to the Dick James Music label was not as heavy as he feared.\n\nBut Dick, already in poor health after a heart bypass, was left distraught by what he saw as a betrayal from the man he\u2019d \u201cseen as a son\u201d.\n\nLess than three months later he suffered a sudden heart attack and died, Stephen believes due to the stress.\n\nYet today he claims Elton only coldly sent his sympathies via his lawyer, never following with a card or flowers.\n\nAnd he adds the star has never apologised for the strain caused by the case \u2013 until the hint of recognition in his passage from Me: Elton John.\n\n\u201cI loved Dick\u201d, writes Elton, conceding: \u201cIt was really ugly, really sad.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t how the story of Dick and I was supposed to end at all.\u201d\n\nFor Stephen, the words are incredibly poignant \u2013 he just wishes now to hear them directly from the singer.\n\n\u201cMy father couldn\u2019t live with the fact Elton had turned on him,\u201d he explains, sitting in his office surrounded by the singer\u2019s gold and platinum discs.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind he would have lived longer if it wasn\u2019t for the stress of the court case.\n\n\u201cMy mother told me afterwards he just couldn\u2019t come to terms with how Elton had attacked him.\n\n\u201cHe keeled over and died and I got a message sent to me via Elton\u2019s lawyer, to say how sorry Elton was for our loss. But he made no personal contact.\n\n\u201cHe was a coward, he didn\u2019t have the guts to personally contact me.\n\n\u201cHe could have written and said how sorry he was, \u2018Sorry for your loss\u2019. To get it via his lawyers was\n\nvery hurtful.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s kind and apologetic in the book that means a lot to me. But to hear from him would help me move on.\u201d\n\nSince the case, Stephen, who still works as a music publisher, has only seen Elton once, in a restaurant in the French Riviera city of Nice, four years ago.\n\n\u201cI said hello, he said hello, and then as he left he put his hand on my shoulder,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cA psychologist friend told me that might be a form of apology, but he couldn\u2019t actually verbally say sorry.\n\n\u201cI always felt he had trouble expressing his innermost feelings.\n\n\u201cMaybe he had a hard time after my father\u2019s death feeling guilty.\n\n\u201cA letter or phone call would be nice, it would help me put it to rest.\u201d\n\nDick and Stephen, who at 72 is just two months older than Elton, played instrumental roles in the creation of Elton John, yet feature little in Me.\n\nDick was also portrayed in Elton\u2019s recent biopic Rocketman, produced by his husband, David Furnish.\n\nHe was played by Line of Duty actor Stephen Graham as a bad-tempered figure, much to Stephen\u2019s horror.\n\nThe truth, he says, couldn\u2019t have been more different.\n\nElton was 20 when he first came to the attention of DJM in 1967, after practising one evening in their recording studio without permission.\n\nThe bespectacled lad from Pinner, Middlesex, let in by a pal, was dragged in to see Stephen.\n\n\u201cHe comes in shaking like a leaf, very shy. Quite nervous, almost like being like he was being called to the teacher\u2019s study,\u201d Stephen recalls.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThankfully, young Reg\u2019s recordings had caught Stephen\u2019s ear. The lyrics were bad, but the compositions \u201cinteresting\u201d, he said.\n\nHe took them to his dad and Dick told him to develop the unlikely star.\n\nAn advert was placed in the NME for a lyricist, and a teenage Bernie Taupin sent in some poems.\n\nHe and Elton hit it off and have remained songwriting partners.\n\nBut as Stephen and Dick started working with the talented pair, they struggled to make a performer of the painfully shy Elton.\n\nStephen recalls how his stage fright got so bad that some days he would not even get out of bed.\n\n\u201cHe was shy, awkward, podgy, introvert,\u201d he remembers.\n\n\u201cOne occasion, when he was supposed to do a gig at Southampton University, he phoned at 10am screaming down the phone at me \u2018I\u2019m not going... stuff your f***ing gig\u2019.\n\n\u201cI would say, \u2018You will ruin your career before you get one if you get known as someone who cancels gigs\u2019.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt happened a few times, fear of going on stage and not going down well. I would send a girl in the office round to get him out of bed.\u201d\n\nBut Elton was happier after accepting his sexuality, and beginning a relationship with his manager, John Reid. Again, Stephen\u2019s dad played a key role.\n\nStephen recalls: \u201cElton would come to the office and ask to see my father on his own, and he would discuss with him, a bit like a father, his sexual problems. He was struggling with his sexuality, not sure which direction he was going in.\u201d\n\nIn those days, the drink and drug problems which dogged Elton after he left DJM in 1976 to set up his own label, weren\u2019t overt. But Stephen suspected the star had begun to use.\n\n\u201cHis behaviour was erratic, one moment being nice the next extremely aggressive and abusive,\u201d he recalls.\n\nHe says he is glad Elton appears to have finally found contentment with David, and their two young sons.\n\n\u201cHe needed the stability of a settled relationship, giving him the love he was craving,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI think he would be an extremely good dad,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cHe wants to give them a life he doesn\u2019t feel he was given as a child, with more affection and loving.\u201d\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
