That would be, I think, revolutionary from an Australian perspective -- we can be the pathfinder for that,\" he added.\n\nAccording to Marceddo, when it comes to the digital challenges of the future, leadership is required from right across the board: Industry, government, and the research base.\n\n\"Technology impacts everybody ... what is that doing at a social perspective, what is that doing at a technology perspective, at a security perspective, and that's why I think what the institute and what this research is about is not only looking at the verticals, but looking at the horizontals, and how we can understand better and develop better research or better outcomes -- or position ourselves to get better outcomes. We'll then take that research and blend it in with government programs and industry solutions,\" he continued.\n\n\"It's very important that everybody takes leadership, but certainly from a research perspective. Universities have a very strong hand, and ECU ... it's an amazing capability that we've got here. I think if we can grow that and show a lot of leadership, from a national perspective, we can only benefit society as we move forward.\"\n\nThe Institute for Securing Digital Futures is the first of four new university-wide research centres that will be launched by ECU as part of its enhanced focus research. The other institutes are expected to focus on ecosystems and global change, as well as optimising health, society, and culture, Marceddo said.\n\n\"[We're] working with the ecosystem that's not only in WA but across Australia and regionally to make this a real success,\" he added.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "Edith Cowan University's new institute takes the lead to protect Australia's online security.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/25/e016d370-e69b-4995-b2e2-d4c46794fdc6/thumbnail/770x578/517e1e046d719e40ff3ad7e486be2447/data-protection-and-cyber-security.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
