They\u2019re readily available, easy to cook, affordable and packed with protein.\n\n\u201cThe egg is meant to be something that has all the right ingredients to grow an organism, so obviously it\u2019s very nutrient dense,\u201d says Christopher Blesso, associate professor of nutritional science at the University of Connecticut in the US.\n\nEating eggs alongside other food can help our bodies absorb more vitamins, too. For example, one study found that adding an egg to salad can increase how much vitamin E we get from the salad.\n\nBut for decades, eating eggs has also been controversial due to their high cholesterol content \u2013 which some studies have linked to an increased risk of heart disease. One egg yolk contains around 185 milligrams of cholesterol, which is more than half of the 300mg daily amount of cholesterol that the US dietary guidelines recommended until recently.\n\nDoes that mean eggs, rather than an ideal food, might actually be doing us harm?\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 Can chicken soup cure the common cold?\n\n\u2022 Are you eating enough salt?\n\n\u2022 How much water should you drink a day?\n\nCholesterol, a yellowish fat produced in our liver and intestines, can be found in every one of our body\u2019s cells. We normally think of it as \u201cbad\u201d. But cholesterol is a crucial building block in our cell membranes. It also is needed for the body to make vitamin D, and the hormones testosterone and oestrogen.\n\nWe produce all the cholesterol we need on our own, but it\u2019s also found in animal produce we consume, including beef, prawns and eggs, as well as cheese and butter.\n\nCholesterol is transported around our body by lipoprotein molecules in the blood. Every person has a different combination of various types of lipoproteins, and our individual make-up plays a role in determining our risk of developing heart disease.\n\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol \u2013 referred to as \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol \u2013 is transported from the liver to arteries and body tissues. Researchers say that this can result in a build-up of cholesterol in the blood vessels and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nBut researchers haven\u2019t definitively linked consumption of cholesterol to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. As a result, US dietary guidelines no longer have a cholesterol restriction; nor does the UK. Instead, emphasis is placed on limiting how much saturated fat we consume, which can increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Foods containing trans fats, in particular, increase our LDL levels. Although some trans fats occur naturally in animal products, most are made artificially and are found in highest levels in margarines, snacks, and some deep-fried and baked foods, such as pastry, doughnuts and cake.\n\nMeanwhile, along with prawns, eggs are the only food high in cholesterol that are low in saturated fat.\n\n\u201cWhile the cholesterol in eggs is much higher than in meat and other animal products, saturated fat increases blood cholesterol. This has been demonstrated by lots of studies for many years,\u201d says Maria Luz Fernandez, professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Connecticut in the US, whose latest research found no relationship between eating eggs and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe discussion on the health effects of eggs has shifted partly because our bodies can compensate for the cholesterol we consume.\n\n\u201cThere are systems in place so that, for most people, dietary cholesterol isn\u2019t a problem,\u201d says Elizabeth Johnson, research associate professor of nutritional sciences at Tufts University in Boston, US.\n\nIn a 2015 review of 40 studies, Johnson and a team of researchers couldn\u2019t find any conclusive evidence on the relationship between dietary cholesterol and heart disease.\n\n\u201cHumans have good regulation when consuming dietary cholesterol, and will make less cholesterol themselves,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd when it comes to eggs, cholesterol may pose even less of a health risk. Cholesterol is more harmful when oxidised in our arteries, but oxidisation doesn\u2019t happen to the cholesterol in eggs, says Blesso.\n\n\u201cWhen cholesterol is oxidised, it may be more inflammatory, and there are all kinds of antioxidants in eggs that protect it from being oxidised,\u201d he says.\n\nAlso, some cholesterol may actually be good for us. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol travels to the liver, where it\u2019s broken down and removed from the body. HDL is thought to have a protective effect against cardiovascular disease by preventing cholesterol from building up in the blood.\n\n\u201cPeople should be concerned about cholesterol that circulates in their blood, which is the one that leads to heart disease,\u201d says Fernandez.\n\nWhat matters is the ratio of HDL to LDL in our bodies, as elevated HDL counteracts the effects of LDL.\n\nHowever, while most of us are able to buffer the cholesterol we consume with the cholesterol we synthesise in our livers, Blesso says around a third of us will experience an increase in blood cholesterol by 10% to 15% after consuming it.\n\nTrials have found that lean and healthy people are more likely to see an increase in LDL after eating eggs. Those who are overweight, obese or diabetic will see a smaller increase in LDL and more HDL molecules, Blesso says. So, if you\u2019re healthier to begin with, eggs potentially could have a more negative effect than if you\u2019re overweight \u2013 but if you\u2019re healthier, you\u2019re also more likely to have good HDL levels, so an increase in LDL probably isn\u2019t very harmful.\n\nResearch published earlier this year, though, challenged the recent consensus that eggs pose no harm to our health. Researchers looked at data from 30,000 adults followed for an average of 17 years and found that each additional half an egg per day was significantly linked to a higher risk of heart disease and death. (They controlled for the subjects\u2019 diet patterns, overall health and physical activity to try to isolate the effects of eggs.)\n\n\u201cWe found that, for every additional 300mg cholesterol person consumed, regardless of the food it came from, they had a 17% increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and 18% increased risk of all-cause mortality,\u201d says Norrina Allen, one of the study\u2019s authors and associate professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University in Illinois, US.\n\n\u201cWe also found that each half egg per day led to a 6% increased risk of heart disease and 8% increased risk of mortality.\u201d\n\nDespite the study being one of the largest of its kind to address this specific relationship between eggs and heart disease, it was observational, giving no indication of cause and effect. It also relied upon a single set of self-reported data \u2013 participants were asked what they ate over the previous month or year, then followed up their health outcomes for up to 31 years. This means the researchers only got a single snapshot of what the participants were eating, even though our diets can change over time.\n\nAnd the study conflicts with past results. Numerous studies suggest eggs are good for heart health. One previous analysis of half a million adults in China, published in 2018, even found the exact opposite: egg consumption was associated with lower risk of heart disease. Those who ate eggs every day had an 18% lower risk of death from heart disease and 28% lower risk of stroke death compared to those who didn\u2019t eat eggs.\n\nLike the previous study, it too was observational \u2013 meaning it\u2019s impossible to tease out cause and effect. (Do healthier adults in China simply eat more eggs, or do the eggs make them healthier?). That, of course, may be a big part of the confusion.\n\nGood egg\n\nWhile these studies have reignited the debate on the impact of cholesterol in eggs on our health, we do know some ways in which eggs could affect our risk of disease.\n\nOne way is through a compound in eggs called choline, which may help protect us against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It also protects the liver.\n\nBut it may have negative effects, too. Choline is metabolised by gut microbiota into a molecule called TMO, which is then absorbed into people\u2019s livers and converted to TMAO, a molecule associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Blasso has wondered if eating a lot of choline from eggs could lead to elevations of TMAO: he found studies where people were observed to have elevated TMAO levels up to 12 hours after eating eggs.\n\nResearch measuring egg consumption and TMAO has so far only found transient increases in TMAO. However, TMAO is measured as a marker for heart disease only at a baseline level, which can be detected when people are fasting. Blasso likens this to how our blood sugar levels increase temporarily after eating carbohydrates, but elevated blood sugar levels are only associated with diabetes when these levels are continuous.\n\nThis may be because when we eat eggs, we might only get choline\u2019s beneficial effects, he says.\n\n\u201cThe problem is when, instead of being absorbed into the blood, choline continues to the large intestine, where it can become TMA and then TMAO,\u201d says Fernandez.\n\n\u201cBut in eggs, choline is absorbed and doesn\u2019t go to the large intestine, so it doesn\u2019t increase the risk of heart disease.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, scientists are beginning to understand other health benefits of eggs. Egg yolks are one of the best sources of lutein, a pigment that has been linked to better eyesight and lower risk of eye disease, for example.\n\n\u201cThere are two types of lutein found the retina of the eye, where it can protect the retina from light damage by working as a blue light filter, as exposure to light makes the eye deteriorate,\u201d says Johnson.\n\nWhile researchers are a long way from understanding why eggs affect us differently, the vast majority of recent research suggests they pose no risk to our health, and are much more likely to provide health benefits.\n\nEven so, having eggs for breakfast every day probably isn\u2019t healthiest option, either \u2013 at least as it\u2019s recommended we have a varied diet\u2026 rather than put all our eggs in one basket.\n\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cThe Essential List\u201d.
