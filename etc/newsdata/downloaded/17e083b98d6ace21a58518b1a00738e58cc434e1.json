I have to be honest here: I was not a huge fan of Agatha Christie or her works at that time.\n\nBut I had just accepted the role of Iago at the Royal Shakespeare Company, and I was being paid more to do this film that I would be paid at the RSC, and I thought, \u201cWell, yes, I\u2019ll have a go\u201d.\n\nThe way I played Inspector Japp has to be one of the worst performances of my whole career, but the film gave me the opportunity to work with the wonderful Peter Ustinov, who was starring as Poirot.\n\nI became friendly with him, and I remember saying to Peter one day as we chatted in his trailer, \u201cI\u2019d love to play Poirot one day\u201d. He looked at me, and said, \u201cYou\u2019d be very good, I think\u201d.\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nCut to 1987. The producer Brian Eastman took me out to an Indian restaurant when we lived in Acton, and he said, \u201cWe\u2019d like to do this series: ten one-hour short stories of Poirot. Would you be interested in playing Hercule Poirot?\u201d\n\nI hadn\u2019t read the books at all. When the scripts came in, I read them and felt that Poirot could be a wonderful character to play, but I still wasn\u2019t sure whether I should do it. So I rang up my brother confident he would give me good advice.\n\n\u201cYou want my advice?\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t touch it with a bargepole\u201d.\n\nThe message of this story, of course, is never listen to any elder sibling! The wonderful success of Poirot obviously changed my life beyond recognition.\n\n(Image: David Suchet)\n\nOnce chosen, I read every book and made a dossier of all Poirot\u2019s characteristics: his clothes; his move from a pocket watch to a wristwatch, and how he couldn\u2019t deal with that; the stripe of his trousers; his likes and dislikes; putting lavender water on his hands; how he refused to eat two boiled eggs not the same size; how his pictures had to be straight; how he would be immaculately turned out. Especially how he spoke.\n\nIt was all those little details that were so important to me.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to play a character in a film, an eight-part television series, for the run of a play. But for 25 years?\n\nTo keep the character fresh and believable, before every series I would watch about 10 hours of my performance from the previous series, and would make sure, as much as possible, that he was the same person.\n\n(Image: David Suchet)\n\nObviously, he aged. His energy levels changed too, but the actual man, I hope, stayed the same.\n\nTo help me get into character as Poirot again at the beginning of each series, I developed techniques.\n\nI would get out my cane, in my house, walk around the garden like him, speak out loud like him, attempt to look at the world through his eyes, reflecting his conviction that God had put him on earth to rid it of crime.\n\nI got the reputation for always being in character. On set and off set, I tried to speak like Poirot, walk like him. I even used to speak to my wife like him, and to my agent, when he rang.\n\nIt would still be Poirot, because he was such an extreme character. It\u2019s very difficult just to switch from being yourself to the character you\u2019re playing on set.\n\nDuring filming you must be in costume for hours at a time, which is sometimes very uncomfortable!\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nThe armadillo padding I had to wear was extremely hot, especially because we were filming in Morocco - I actually passed out on the set. We had air-conditioning units because, of course, Poirot was not allowed to perspire. Unthinkable.\n\nAfter I\u2019d shot my final scenes in 2013, the company kindly gave me some mementos, which I will always treasure.\n\nThey include a beautiful green-baize cloth, on which, in the series, I used to lay all my toiletries; my wing collar, with a rounded tip; my bow-ties; my tisane glasses, from which I drank my tisane.\n\nThen there\u2019s a personalised handkerchief, a coffin plate, two inkpots, a little egg timer, a moustache comb, moustache wax, black colouring I put on the moustache, a tiny moustache trimmer as well as a small silver serviette holder.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nA prayer book with a rosary on it, a little leather crucifix, always by my bed in the series. And a tiny toast rack; not an ordinary toast rack - it wouldn\u2019t be, would it, for Poirot?\n\nA shell ashtray, a small mustard pot with a minute spoon, cufflinks, dress-shirt studs, the famous silver lapel flower vase with dried flowers, my razors, and a three-pronged fork for eating oysters.\n\nI never regretted my decision to play Poirot, or wanted to stop. What are my thoughts on Poirot now, you may wonder?\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the last day of shooting, knowing it was the end of Poirot for me. In certain stills of my last episode - not the one when I died, but the last episode I filmed - you can see the sadness in Poirot\u2019s eyes: well, my eyes really. When I look back, I can\u2019t believe it actually happened.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nI ask, \u201chow is that possible? What was it about that little man that prompted the public to watch stories about him for a quarter of a century?\u201dJust possibly, Poirot, or at least my Poirot, may never date.\n\nPoirot has gone for me; not banished from my memory, but I\u2019m moving on in life, yet I still get these fan letters from people who are watching the series now, and saying the same things that people did when writing to me nearly 30 years ago.\n\nI think it\u2019s that people feel safe when they watch him. Poirot offers, perhaps, the greatest moral compass.\n\nBecause I played Poirot for such a long time, I think there\u2019s inevitably a degree of overlap between his values and mine.\n\nTo an extent, that was always going to happen. After I finished filming the last episode, there was a sort of grieving process. I\u2019m still grieving now. Because Poirot was my best friend; my alter ego, in many ways. I knew him better than anybody I know.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nI knew what he\u2019d like to look at. I knew what he\u2019d choose for breakfast. I knew everything about him. I grieve for him in a different way than I grieve for other characters I\u2019ve finished playing, because he was so much a part of my life, and affected it in so many deep and personal ways.\n\nLooking back, it was a gloriously happy time. Not without its fraught moments, of course.\n\nI had to fight sometimes for the character, and there were always some directors who wanted to do things differently, or got fed up with the way Poirot was so prissy, such as the time when I wanted to wipe a park bench with my handkerchief and then sit down on the handkerchief, which was a description drawn directly from Agatha Christie\u2019s book.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to do that,\u201d said the director. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what Poirot does\u201d, I responded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s what he does,\u201d and there was a huge argument.\n\n(Image: David Suchet)\n\nSo, I became the defender of Agatha Christie\u2019s Poirot; what she said he would do, I would fight for. In the end I got my way about the handkerchief but it was cut in the final edit!\n\nEven today, six years after I finished as Poirot, people still identify me with him. They see me as Poirot, yet they don\u2019t see him.\n\nI don\u2019t have his 46-inch waist, or speak with a funny accent, or have his moustache. I\u2019m not this odd, strange-looking little man. And yet they recognise me as Poirot.\n\nThey always say, \u201cIt\u2019s your eyes\u201d. Or, occasionally, my voice.\"\n\nBehind the Lens: My Life by David Suchet is published by Constable on October 3 in hardback, \u00a325.\n\nDavid is raising awareness for the UK charity Tuberous Sclerosis Association which funds important research into Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, a rare genetic condition that affects around one million people worldwide.\n\nFor more information please visit www.tuberous-sclerosis.org", "description": "David Suchet, 73, finished filming the last episode in 2013 and admits \"there was a sort of grieving process... because Poirot was my best friend\"", "authors": ["David Suchet", "Sara Wallis", "Image", "Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Itv", "Wireimage", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20422987.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Poirot-The-Theft-of-the-Royal-Ruby-TV-Programme-1991dc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
