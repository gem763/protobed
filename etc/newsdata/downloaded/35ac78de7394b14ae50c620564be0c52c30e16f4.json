Photo: ABC\n\nAmerica\u2019s favorite members of Bachelor Nation weren\u2019t the only ones frolicking on the beach this summer during Bachelor in Paradise. There were also animals. A lot of them. And those B-roll critters often serve as agents of foreshadowing, acting as the Mexican chorus in this Greek tragedy. They may fly and crawl under our subconscious radar, but they\u2019re telling a story of their own \u2014 if we only pay attention. Each species had its own crucial role to play this season: every feather full of symbolism, no sandy skuttle too small to ignore. So get out your scrunchies, call dibs on the boom-boom room, and buckle up for nature\u2019s most dramatic deep dive ever.\n\nA Journey Into the Exoskeleton\n\nPhotos: ABC. Photos: ABC.\n\nIf BIP footage is any indication, the beaches of Sayulita are completely overrun by various species of crabs. But these crustaceans are not simply random; they symbolize the weakness hiding under the surface, the shortcomings protected by a hard shell, just waiting to be revealed with the slightest crack. Throughout this season, footage of a single crab in some sort of solitary trial consistently precedes moments that highlight our contestants\u2019 fatal flaws.\n\nTake, for example, Annalise\u2019s overconfidence despite her questionable character judgement and utter lack of self-awareness. In episode two, we see various clips of a crab struggling in the sand before Annalise stirs up the Clay and Angela drama, as well as immediately before she gives Chris \u201ckiss prescriptions,\u201d noting her conviction that he will give her a rose. We even catch a blink-and-you-miss-it clip of a crab engaged in violent activity with its own claw \u2014 an ouroboros moment as Annalise shoots herself in the foot, failing to secure both her sanity and a rose to stay another week. These crab moments continue all season: Dylan\u2019s clinginess, Caelynn\u2019s idealism, Cam\u2019s intensity, Blake\u2019s well-intentioned brooding, and Tahzjuan\u2019s brutal honesty all receive the crustacean punctuation. No fatal flaw is immune to getting the crab treatment, with John Paul Jones\u2019s sad excuse for a gag reflex and proclivity for vomit securing four separate instances of crab spotlight.\n\nThe Man, the Mustache, the Metamorphosis\n\nPhoto: ABC\n\nDean, who destroyed everyone\u2019s life last summer in Paradise, makes his grand return alongside the appearance of a black bird, a peacock, and a caterpillar. These mere seconds of footage hint at his entire narrative arc this season, illustrating how he\u2019s perceived by the audience as ostentatious, then sly, then (hopefully) metamorphosed.\n\nFirst, we have the peacock \u2014 in the words of Dean himself, \u201cWhen everyone starts to look like each other, you do what you can to stand out.\u201d And stand out like a flashy bird he does, with tattoo choices that rival Pete Davidson, a firm dedication to #vanlife, and the use of a mustache as a personality trait. But Dean is not merely here to innocently peacock around the beach: The black bird \u2014 specifically, the Common Grackle \u2014 is a sign of looming darkness, that Mr. Steal Your Girl is back in business. Dean immediately woos Caitlyn away from both Cam and Mike, leaving them both blindsided. The journey does not end there, though, for the caterpillar hints that there is a long road ahead. We know that Dean isn\u2019t looking for a relationship, and neither is Caelynn, who responds \u201cthat\u2019s cool\u201d when her adorable fuzzy caterpillar man says that he \u201clacks foresight\u201d and that his priorities are van adventures. To no one\u2019s surprise, Dean self-sabotages shortly thereafter, dumping Caelynn on her birthday. But the metamorphosis is just beginning as he flees Mexico for a journey of cocoonlike introspection, only to return to the beach \u201ca changed man,\u201d begging Caelynn to take him back. In this moment, Dean has shed both his mustache and his chrysalis; he is a self-aware butterfly back for his butterfly queen. A new question arises: Will these crazy insect kids survive once they are released from captivity, let loose back into the LA habitat? As with any prodigal son, only time will tell.\n\nThe Pigeon versus the Seagull\n\nPhoto: ABC\n\nEpisode seven brings us the gift of Haley and Tahzjuan\u2019s arrival. These two newcomers take to the beach and proceed to fight over John Paul Jones, wielding their date cards and sweeping him away on back-to-back dates. The animals really come out to play when Tahzjuan calls Haley a \u201cpigeon\u201d and describes herself and JPJ as \u201cseagulls.\u201d This rare moment of creature symbolism plays out not visually, but aloud, with Tahzjuan as the master of her own metaphor. However, pigeon Haley usurps the thought-to-be-superior seagull Tahzjuan. She receives JPJ\u2019s rose, reminding us that the animal kingdom doesn\u2019t always play by the rules. Or, as she puts it, \u201cA seagull is just as bad as a pigeon. Seagulls are like the scum of the ocean and pigeons are like the scum of the earth. There\u2019s more water on the earth than there is just, earth, you know?\u201d Philosophy at its finest, and a victory for pigeons everywhere.\n\nWhat\u2019s Good for the Goose Is a Nightmare for the Gander\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotos: ABC. Photos: ABC.\n\nIn Episode 8, Goose (a.k.a. Chris) and Krystal return to Mexico for their ABC-sponsored wedding, with the paradise gang joining a bunch of outsiders and former cast members at the ceremony. In an unprecedented animal B-Roll move, Goose himself is the only critter that appears for nearly an hour. What follows is pure chaos caused by the disruption of Paradise norms. First, there is discussion of the outside world as Tia tells Blake that Twitter is blowing up about him, and Ashley I. jokes that he\u2019s going to have to move to Europe. Then, new competition is thrown into the herd, with the long-foreshadowed appearance of Clay\u2019s ex, Angela. Previously confident in her relationship, Nicole mentions that Angela is \u201cinvading the world I\u2019ve created with Clay \u2014 she\u2019s an intruder on my happiness, my relationship.\u201d Try as he might to \u201cinstill faith and hope in this process,\u201d Chris Harrison cannot prevent the nuptials from turning into a total free-for-all, as the outside world bleeds in, disrupting the delicate narrative that producers have carefully crafted. In fact, the brawls and tribulations from Goose\u2019s wedding plague the entire remainder of the season \u2014 highlighting the epic destruction that occurs when invasive species are introduced into America\u2019s favorite dystopian bubble.\n\nThe Agent of Death\n\nPhoto: ABC\n\nA nefarious, gangly bird repeatedly appears onscreen, usually at night, always alone, and oftentimes eating something mysterious and disgusting. He is the grim reaper of Paradise, signaling the end of a journey. From Bibiana and Wills to Derek and Tahzjaun, this spooky creature materializes to foreshadow departure. If you see him, hold your breath, get out the tissues, and immediately tune in to the Twitter feed of his next, ill-fated victim.\n\nThe Complete and Utter Trolling\n\nClockwise from top left: Photo: ABC Photo: ABC Photo: ABC Photo: ABC Clockwise from top left: Photo: ABC Photo: ABC Photo: ABC Photo: ABC\n\nA late addition, Matt Donald enters paradise in episode ten, armed with a date card and a bucket of anxiety. He asks Sydney, who is inexplicably no longer with Mike, to join him on a day of eating spicy things and learning sign language. In what could have been a perfect rom-com moment, he teaches her how to sign \u201ckiss me,\u201d which she then does repeatedly. But he does not kiss her. After getting smooching advice from every bozo on the beach, Matt finally goes for it, only after Sydney consents to the point of exasperation. What follows is the most absurd display of B-roll footage this franchise has ever seen. There are crabs. There are turtles. There are baby horses and grown horses. There are stadiums and crowds, butterflies and dolphins. There is NASA footage. There is a guy catching a football and a lion roaring. An entire dissertation could be written about the symbolism in these moments of B-roll. But the thesis is clear: We are all a bunch of suckers, tuning in four hours a week with the hope of feeling something more than pure escapism. As much as we joke about Bachelor in Paradise between commercial breaks, we long to bask in the joy of its absurdity \u2014 for the creature-filled version of this reality, preposterous and idiotic as it may often be, is far preferable to our own.", "description": "The B-roll on ABC\u2019s Bachelor in Paradise is teeming with crabs, birds, and wild animals.
