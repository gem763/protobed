And when you look at that, under Duke of York it shows Buckingham Palace London.'\n\n'He has thirteen phone number to contact the Duke. And (these numbers went everywhere), Wood Farm, Sunninghill Wood Farm, Sunninghill numbers, the Palace, his home number, his home email. He even had a phone number to his modem, I guess to call into his modem.'\n\nPrivate investigator Mr Fisten was one of the first to interview Virginia Roberts, who has made claims that Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was 17.\n\nPrince Andrew has previously denied being aware of any of Epstein's illegal activities. He is pictured above in 2010 answering the door of Epstein's New York mansion\n\nDuring an interview with the Channel 4 programme, Mr Fitsen makes clear that vulnerable girls were targeted and that there had been no way you could have been around Epstein and not have been around such people.\n\nHe added: 'When people tell me, I didn't know what Jeffrey was about, I don't want to say BS. I'll just say hogwash. Because if you were around Jeffrey you were around underage girls. He has no children. He has no nieces\u2026 Come on. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that something was going on there.'\n\nVirginia Roberts (centre) claimed she had sex with Prince Andrew (left) several times and that it had once involved other girls. Ghislaine Maxwell is pictured, right\n\nThe new Channel 4 investigation looks into 1,200 pages of documents made public to a Manhattan court.\n\nThese documents reveal that Ms Roberts claimed that the third time Prince Andrew had sex with her, it had also been with several other young girls.\n\nThe programme cites a court deposition made in January 2015 as part of a defamation case brought by Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, where she states that the 'third time' she had 'sex with Andy' was 'in an orgy on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands'. She said she was 18 at the time and that 'approximately eight other young girls, and I had sex together'.\n\nShe said Epstein had joked that the girls couldn't communicate well due to a language barrier and that he said they were the 'easiest' girls to get along with.\n\nMs Roberts' evidence was thrown out in May 2015.\n\nIt has also previously been claimed that Epstein's house keeper in Palm Beach had seen Prince Andrew visiting the mansion three or four times, and claimed that he would receive massages from girls who were staying there.\n\nOn the Dispatches programme tonight, Mr Fisten says he was shocked by what he found during his enquiries.\n\nHe said that some girls confessed to him that they would wear the same outfit to school every single day and that they barely had enough food to eat. This he says, was exactly the type of girl Epstein had been looking for.\n\nEarlier this year Buckingham Palace said: 'Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.' and 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.'\n\nThis is while Prince Andrew said: 'At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.'", "description": "Discovered at Jeffrey Epstein's mansion in Florida, the address book was found to have contact details for several of the Duke of York's residences, including Buckingham Palace.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/08/19949294-0-image-a-2_1571556087890.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
