(Photo: Matteo Mobilio)\n\nOur series \u201cHow I became a \u2026\u201d digs into the stories of accomplished and influential people, finding out how they got to where they are in their careers.\n\nAmy Astley is no stranger to the twinkling lights and vibrant pulse of the magazine world. As the editor-in-chief of Architectural Digest, Astley has translated her years of editorial experience at the likes of Vogue, Teen Vogue and House & Garden to take the helm of the 100-year-old Architectural Digest brand, molding it into a massive digital and print platform for the ages. Astley\u2019s position at Architectural Digest \u2013 which just released \u201cArchitectural Digest at 100: A Century of Style,\u201d a book that takes readers into the homes of everyone from Barack Obama to David Bowie \u2013 cements her spot as a magazine industry icon.\n\nUSA TODAY caught up with the magazine editor-in-chief and author to talk about everything from lapsang souchong tea and Frank Ocean to taking the reins as founding editor of Teen Vogue and the importance of leaning into technology.\n\nQuestion: How did you get your start in the industry?\n\nAmy Astley: When I was 11, I fell in love with New York City and I fell in love with ballet, and those two things really propelled what happened to me next. I graduated from Michigan State University and came straight to New York. I wasn\u2019t a strong enough dancer to be professional after college, and my second passion is reading, writing and storytelling. Magazines really deeply appealed to me; I liked the idea of putting visuals and words together and telling a story with that.\n\nThat\u2019s how I started. I started at House & Garden Magazine, worked there for five years, and worked my way up from being the editor-in-chief\u2019s assistant to being everybody else\u2019s assistant. I learned a lot, and the women there were amazing \u2013 there were lots of mentors there \u2013 like Wendy Goodman was a huge mentor to me \u2013 and then Mr. (S.I) Newhouse closed it. A mutual friend recommended me to Anna Wintour, and I went to Vogue. I ended up loving it and staying just shy of a decade, and at the end of the decade she asked me to work on Teen Vogue, this idea she had of a spinoff of Vogue for young people. I founded Teen Vogue and ran it for 13 years. Teen Vogue was editor-in-chief bootcamp: I learned how to run a team, how to hire people and manage them, make a digital product and how to be a mentor to other people and let them shine. It really prepared me for the next step, which was Architectural Digest. I hate to use a clich\u00e9 like dream job, but I think all the currents of my life were pointing me towards AD. I\u2019m fortunate that that\u2019s what happened. I got to come full-circle back to where I started, back to shelter, after a long career in fashion, beauty and the teen world. These decades of working were honing my eye and helping me develop really deep networks and trust among people in the art world, the fashion world, the social world and the entertainment world. Now, I\u2019m able to call on all the networks of people and bring it all back to AD. The decades of doing that work brought me to this place, and I relish it. It\u2019s the perfect job, which is such a gift.\n\n100 years: Architectural Digest celebrates\n\nQ: What does a typical workday look like for you?\n\nAstley: There\u2019s a lot of variety which is great, yet there\u2019s a rhythm to it. I\u2019m an early riser, and I\u2019m up at 6 a.m. I\u2019m a newshound, so I devour The New York Times, read to the New York Post and read a ton online. The morning for me is calm with my tea: I really relish my mornings, and I try to have an hour alone before my kid is up for school. I just take in as much news as I can; there\u2019s just so much to take in, and I\u2019m curious about it and drawing on all of it for ideas. Everything happening in the world is relevant for AD because it\u2019s all about people and how they live and how they\u2019ll live into the future. Child\u2019s up at 7:00 a.m. and at school by 8:00 a.m., and sometimes I walk my dog or go to the gym. I have a lot of breakfasts in the morning with people from the industry or sometimes I\u2019ll go scout an apartment or house in the morning.\n\nI\u2019m often at work at 9, and I don\u2019t like to go out for lunch, so I stay in the office all day. I have an open-door policy, and anybody who wants to see me I try to see them that same day. It\u2019s staff meetings, corporate meetings \u2013 there\u2019s plenty to talk about as far as budgets and corporate business \u2013 and my favorite meetings are looking at art, seeing the issues and looking at the houses. That\u2019s the most inspiring and fun part of the job.\n\nMy day is sort of 9 to 6, and in the evening I go out for work pretty much every night. New York is so social, and I have friends in so many fields here and they\u2019re all doing events all the time. It\u2019s pretty endless, and I love it. I don\u2019t really sit at home much or watch TV much, (then) I do more email in the evening, and it\u2019s intense. I try to exercise every day, somewhere in there. I try to work in about five workouts a week.\n\nThere is no delineation between my work and my personal life; they actually flow into each other, which is why I\u2019m able to thrive in my job. I don\u2019t find it too grueling; I just enjoy it. It\u2019s all one piece.\n\nQ: What\u2019s your favorite part about your job?\n\nAstley: I love seeing the visuals. The most satisfying thing is the houses and seeing them through, from hearing about (them) to scouting to the shoot to the pictures realized and having them come in. I felt this way at Teen Vogue, too: that is the most exciting thing, is seeing the art that we are going to use to make the product. I\u2019m really proud of AD; we put a lot of labor and love and effort and sweat and tears into what we select and how we photograph it and the flow of the spreads, and I feel that we make a collector\u2019s item out of each issue. That\u2019s gratifying. I also love the staff and the team. I really enjoy talking to them and seeing what they do. It\u2019s a pleasure.\n\nQ: To what do you credit your success?\n\nAstley: Ballet, a Midwestern mom, perseverance, working hard and no sense of entitlement. I don\u2019t think I deserve anything. I think you work for it, and you earn it, and the only thing I think we all deserve is respect.\n\nQ: How do you balance work, life and such a busy schedule?\n\nAstley: I tend to work all the time, but I know my limits and I know the things that make me feel taken care of. Exercise is a key thing, and I definitely take care of my body and my health that way. I\u2019ll go every day if I can squeeze it in. That gives me a lot of balance and clarity. My kids are older now, so they\u2019re not as intense to raise as when they were little, but they were always my first priority and continue to be. You don\u2019t do it all; it\u2019s a balance. Everything\u2019s a give-and-take, and I don\u2019t have perfect balance, but I think my friends and family see the struggle. Also, my husband\u2019s amazing. I can\u2019t not give a shoutout to my husband; everything would fall apart without him.\n\nQ: What have been some of your career highlights?\n\nAstley: Launching Teen Vogue was a huge career highlight for me. It was so exciting being told by Cond\u00e9 Nast and Mr. Newhouse himself that they believed in it and that they wanted me to run it. I had carte blanche, and, I mean, how often can that happen to you in your career? Probably never, in a creative career like mine. I had the resources of Cond\u00e9 Nast and my own creativity to make it into what I wanted, which was to make it very female-centric. It was totally unique to the market, and it was very satisfying. I will say, doing AD has possibly even topped that \u2013 all of that has been meteoric and super satisfying. For me, it\u2019s a culmination of my career.\n\nQ: What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?\n\nAstley: Embrace technology; be completely receptive and open to everything new that comes along; just say yes to everything, every experience and every person; try to take in as much as you can and not close down into your own little small world. If someone\u2019s interested in my career, my career is unique and it\u2019s not going to repeat. The magazine industry and the book industry, these things are all changing [but] there\u2019s always going to be storytelling. Always. I think being a good storyteller will always be a great talent, but you\u2019re going to be telling it through different technologies and different platforms. It\u2019s just staying on top of it and being at the forefront of all those developments. If you\u2019re a storyteller, you can always find ways to tell your story.\n\nQuick hits\n\n\u2022 What\u2019s your coffee order? I\u2019ve never had a cup of coffee in my whole life. I drink a lot of tea \u2013 lapsang souchong is my favorite.\n\n\u2022 What is your favorite book? There are some classics I\u2019ve rediscovered with my teenage daughter that I\u2019ve reread that I loved as a kid, and I really love Edith Wharton and Henry James.\n\n\u2022 What is your favorite song at the moment? I love Billie Eilish \u201cBad Guy,\u201d and my daughter\u2019s a Swiftie so I\u2019ve been listening to \u201cLover\u201d and it\u2019s good (I think she\u2019s so talented). My favorite musician is Frank Ocean \u2013 I like everything from Frank Ocean \u2013 and I love Childish Gambino and Chance the Rapper.\n\n\u2022 Who have been your biggest mentors? It really does start with my mother. As a child, I remember listening to her typing as I went to bed. She went back to school to get her master's degree and I could hear her typewriter going, and that was hard. She raised three little kids, there were no nannies or housekeepers or any kind of that stuff, and she did it all. Her discipline, her love of education and her sense of bettering yourself and pushing yourself are all very clearly part of my personality. I was a serious ballet dancer, and I have so many teachers who mentored me, especially one in Michigan named Diane Newman. Professionally, Anna Wintour, definitely. A long time with that one. Anna\u2019s always been a key supporter in my career.\n\n\u2022 What is the coolest thing you\u2019ve ever done? My kids. It\u2019s such a clich\u00e9, but the older you get the more you realize it\u2019s all about your family. My career? I\u2019m proud of it. But, my kids and my long marriage with my husband? That\u2019s the coolest thing I ever did, was make a family.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/careers/2019/10/15/amy-astley-architectural-digest-talks-her-career-and-gives-advice/3945196002/", "description": "Amy Astley, editor-in-chief of Architectural Digest talks about her career highlights and her day-to-day routine", "authors": ["Susannah Hutcheson", "Special To Usa Today", "Published A.M.
