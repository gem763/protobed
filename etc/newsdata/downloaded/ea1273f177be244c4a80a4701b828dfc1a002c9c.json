I think I was stuck on the grass and lost a bit of momentum there and that took a little bit longer. I couldn\u2019t see anything.\n\n\u201cObviously on my side I\u2019m not happy. I can\u2019t be happy with my day today.\u201d\n\nVettel has not won a race for more than a year, his last being at the Belgian Grand Prix in August 2018.\n\nHe also spun at Monza last year after starting on the front row and then colliding with Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton on the opening lap. He fought back from 18th to fourth on that occasion.\n\nHis temperament has been increasingly questioned, however, over the past year with some pundits accusing him of cracking under pressure and making mistakes unworthy of a multiple champion.\n\nAsked by Sky Sports television whether he was falling out of love with the sport, the 32-year-old replied: \u201cNo, not really, I haven\u2019t.\n\n\u201cOf course I still love what I do, but surely when you\u2019re not doing well what you know you can do well, you can\u2019t be happy.\u201d", "description": "Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel has entered the danger zone for a race ban after falling foul of Formula One stewards on a nightmare Italian Grand Prix Sunday for the German.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427678766&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870X6-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
