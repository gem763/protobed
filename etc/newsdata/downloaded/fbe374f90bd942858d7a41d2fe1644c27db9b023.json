The Bureau of Labor Statistics has long been counting work stoppages, which include strikes and lock outs. In 1969, there were 412 work stoppages involving at least 1,000 workers, the agency said. In 2018, there were just 20 \u2014 and that was a jump from 7 stoppages the year before.\n\nIn fact, this is the United Auto Workers\u2019 first national strike since a two-day walk out in 2007. There were 21 work stoppages that year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted.\n\nThe new UAW strike wasn\u2019t a light decision, according to the union\u2019s vice president, Terry Dittes. \u201cWe clearly understand the hardship that it may cause,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are standing up for fair wages, we are standing up for affordable quality health care, we are standing up for our share of the profits,\u201d he told the Associated Press.\n\nGM said on its website it was disappointed with the strike. \u201cWe presented a fair offer to the UAW leadership that addresses wages, benefits, investments and job security in substantive ways and builds toward our future.\u201d More talks were slated for Monday.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the fall in stoppages and strikes?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a lot more dangerous to strike in the last 30 years,\u201d said Lawrence Mishel, a labor-market economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. The decline in labor-union membership has also been a \u201cmajor factor,\u201d he said. In 2018, 10.5% of workers were in unions, down from 20.1% in 1983, the first year for which comparable data was available.\n\nUnion membership rates could be dropping further. Among U.S. adults employed either full or part-time, 10% were union members as of August 2019, according to Gallup.\n\n\u201cStrikes as protest, rather than the long-term shutting down of an employer will become much more prominent,\u201d Mishel said, citing Google GOOG, -0.67% workers walking off the job for a couple hours in November 2018 to challenge the tech giant\u2019s handling of sexual harassment allegations. Other countries have more clout: Over 90% of workers in Ireland are members of a labor union.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss: Want to stage a protest like Google workers?

A union spokesman told the newspaper that 2018 monthly membership averaged 405,000. The union had more than 701,000 members in 2002, the News reported.\n\nU.S. companies have outsourced their manufacturing overseas, so there are fewer factory workers to go on strike. As the 2016 presidential election showed, many of these workers are either underemployed or jobless. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 forbid unions from contributing to political campaigns and forbids \u201cunion shops\u201d unless a majority of employees have voted in favor of them.\n\nMishel said a closely-watched 1981 air-traffic controller strike set a new tone for companies. That year, 11,345 unionized air-traffic controllers walked off their government jobs and President Ronald Reagan ended up firing most of them. \u201cThat was sort of a signal to management this was now acceptable practice,\u201d said Mishel. \u201cIt was not considered acceptable before.\u201d\n\nDissatisfaction about wage growth and working conditions have increasingly turned many workplaces into \u201ctinderboxes,\u201d Mishel said. \u201cIf a fire can be lit, it\u2019s going to take off around the country,\u201d he said. Real average hourly earnings increased 1.3% on a seasonally adjusted basis from between March 2018 and March 2019, and fell by 0.1% on the month in March.\n\nFor example, thousands of Uber UBER, +3.55% and Lyft LYFT, +3.67% drivers walked off the jobs in May for several hours to protest pay and working conditions. Los Angeles, Calif. drivers turned off their apps for 24 hours.\n\nSee also: Here\u2019s how much more Lyft and Uber rides could cost under California\u2019s gig-worker law\n\nThe two biggest work stoppages of 2019 so far have been teacher strikes in Arizona and Oklahoma, according to the BLS. Both ended with worker raises.\n\nGM GM, -4.25% shares sank 3% in premarket trading Monday on the strike news, but the stock is up almost 13% since the start of the year. That compares to a nearly 20% gain for the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.31% and a 16% increase for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.52% over the same period.\n\nThis story was updated on Sept. 16, 2019.", "description": "Nearly 50,000 United Auto Worker members walked off the job.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR367_UAW_st_ZG_20190916110040.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-08"}
