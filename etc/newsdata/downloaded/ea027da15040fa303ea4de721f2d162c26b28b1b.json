I think he is very important for us. We are sharing and changing some matches with the midfielders like [Matteo] Guendouzi,\u2019 Emery said ahead of Arsenal\u2019s clash with Crystal Palace in the Premier League.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I am very happy with him and we need him. Then we use different structures in different matches and he has confidence. I was speaking with him about his best position to help us in our shape.\n\n\u2018It depends on the shape. Last season his best position was playing as a deep midfield two alongside [Granit] Xhaka or Matteo.\n\n\u2018This year we are playing also sometimes with just one and he can achieve with his quality to get to the box and get closer to score. He is very intelligent about getting space around the box and taking chances.\n\n\u2018Then also, when we prepare the team to do high pressing, for us he is very important because he is very intelligent tactically, but he can play in the two positions. [Either as] one of the two midfielders [or] he can play higher for the pressing and to get into the box.\n\n\u2018Sometimes we also use him as a one-man in midfield doing the covering for the two other players ahead.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nEmery has heavily criticised following Arsenal\u2019s 1-0 defeat at Sheffield United last weekend, but Hector Bellerin has defended his manager and insists the entire squad \u2018trusts\u2019 the Spaniard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think this team has evolved a lot since the beginning of last season,\u2019 Bellerin said.\n\n\u2018When the board sign a manager like Unai, they know it\u2019s all going to be part of a process. \u2018He has his ideas and he\u2019s done so well at Sevilla and Valencia and Paris \u2013 so everyone trusts in the manager.\n\n\u2018Sometimes things don\u2019t go your way but then it\u2019s about turning it around. \u2018I think if you take out from last season those three games which we lost \u2013 it would have been a very positive season and turned out another way.\n\n\u2018It is part of a process and I think we are improving as players and the manager is getting to know us every single day and for us it is to just to keep going forward with the head up.\u2019\n\nMORE: Harry Kane reminds Virgil van Dijk he is \u2018not invincible\u2019 ahead of Tottenham\u2019s trip to Liverpool", "description": "Arsenal boss Unai Emery insists Lucas Torreira is more than capable of playing as an advanced midfielder in Mesut Ozil's absence.
