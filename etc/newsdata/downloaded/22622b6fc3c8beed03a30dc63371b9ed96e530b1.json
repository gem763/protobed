Waller leads all TEs with 26 catches. \u2026 WR Tyrell Williams is first Raiders player since Mervyn Fernandez in 1989 with TD catches in first three games. \u2026 Oakland allowed eight TD drives of 90 or more yards past two seasons, including three in last two weeks. Colts had two scoring drives of 90-plus yards in last week\u2019s victory over Falcons. \u2026 Indy has won seven straight home games and scored at least 23 points in nine straight home games. \u2026 Colts have second-fewest penalties (15) and fewest penalty yards (114) in league. \u2026 Indy\u2019s defense has not allowed 100-yard runner in 21 straight games, second-longest active streak. \u2026 QB Jacoby Brissett has won back-to-back starts for first time in career. \u2026 RB Marlon Mack ranks third in league in yards rushing, averaging 99.7 per game, and needs one 100-yard game to tie Lenny Moore, Randy McMillan and Curtis Dickey for seventh in franchise history (six). \u2026 WR T.Y.
