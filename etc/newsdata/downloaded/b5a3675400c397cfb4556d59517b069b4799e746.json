Thank Tyler Perry. (Seriously.)", "language": "en", "text": "Listen to This Article Audio recording by Audm.\n\nGetting your hair done, cut or installed is a routine event. It can entail some waiting and, perhaps, a few old Ebony magazines or some televised ambience: sports news, one of those Saturday-afternoon cooking shows or, maybe most entertaining, a bootleg DVD of a stage play in which a broad-shouldered, square-jawed 6-foot-6 linebacker of a woman counsels, threatens, mocks and manhandles strangers, neighbors and kin. Her name is Mabel Simmons, although most people know her as Madea, the elderly vulgarian synonymous with Tyler Perry, who since 1999 has been wearing her gray wig and flowery housedresses. Depending on how often your hair needs tending and who\u2019s tending it, Madea could be a regular, involuntary part of your life, like secondhand smoke or traffic.\n\nOver 15 years, Perry has written, directed, acted in and produced more than 20 films of his own and has appeared in other people\u2019s, too1 (that\u2019s him as Colin Powell in \u201cVice\u201d). But before he was one of America\u2019s most successful entertainers, Perry was a star in black America. His clamored-for stage tours built an empire off Madea\u2019s back \u2014 \u201cDiary of a Mad Black Woman,\u201d \u201cMadea\u2019s Class Reunion,\u201d \u201cMadea Goes to Jail,\u201d \u201cMadea Gets a Job.\u201d2 Lots of people saw them live. Even more saw them somewhere else, like in a barber\u2019s chair. There are black people for whom a Tyler Perry show would be a night out and maybe their annual (or very first) trip to the theater. So he gave them their money\u2019s worth. These are loud, long, hysterical shows in which a bunch of characters, not infrequently on a set resembling a sitcom diorama, love and leave one another, imparting morals the way a shot gets put. They aren\u2019t quite farces, dramas or melodramas. They\u2019re not exactly parables, musicals or church, either. They\u2019re usually all of those things. Somebody\u2019s mad, somebody\u2019s cheating, somebody\u2019s dying, somebody\u2019s scheming. Here\u2019s some dirt. Here\u2019s some slapstick. Here\u2019s a gospel song. Here\u2019s the truth. Oh, Lord.\n\nThis cacophony of flat acting and exuberance, as well as the fact of his popularity, have started fights among both critics and civilians about Perry\u2019s merits. Is he good for black people? Is he good at all? (A displeased review I wrote of the film version of \u201cDiary of a Mad Black Woman\u201d garnered ticked-off mail for years, from people certain that my not liking it meant I had to be white.) Do his plays, movies and cable sitcoms \u2014 with their bawdy cartoon carnality, billboard-size lessons, one-dimensional religiosity, rickety domestic partnerships, vituperative socioeconomic clashes, scams and vociferous, flamboyant blackness \u2014 qualify as art? (For the record, they do.)\n\nIf these disputes are musty (I, at least, can smell mold), they\u2019re also moot, because right now a circle of young black playwrights is doing some of the most imaginative, confrontational work in the American theater, and Perry is right there at its center. Didn\u2019t see that coming? Maybe it\u2019s not immediately obvious. But it makes sense. He\u2019s the biggest black playwright in America. If you were a kid, teenager or barely an adult in the 2000s, living in a black city and attracted to the stage, it would be hard for Perry not to become someone to revere, reckon with or resist.\n\nOne of these playwrights is Michael R. Jackson, who built a musical around black people\u2019s love of Perry and his own contempt for Perry\u2019s work. The show is \u201cA Strange Loop,\u201d a ferocious, pungent Off Broadway hit from the summer. It\u2019s about an aspiring playwright who\u2019s miserably gay, unhappily black and stuck in a dull job (as a theater usher) that\u2019s keeping him from a life of creating musicals. His mother, played by a goateed man, disapproves of his art, his sexuality and his taste. Her favorite thing about his talent is that maybe he\u2019ll use it to write a Tyler Perry show. \u201cGod sent Tyler on Earth to be our voice, along with Barack,\u201d she intones.\n\n\u201cA Strange Loop\u201d by Michael R. Jackson, performed off Broadway at Playwrights Horizons in May. Sara Krulwich/The New York Times\n\nJackson has refreshed the argument over whether Perry is good for art and good for black America by asking whether Perry is good for him. The arena for that debate is a gospel number, \u201cAIDS Is God\u2019s Punishment,\u201d in which the crowd-pleasing pieties of a Perry play are steered into deadly-serious satire. The set is suddenly transformed into a smaller version of the split-level houses you\u2019d typically see in a Perry show. But upstairs, where in Perry\u2019s world the characters would talk about or simulate sex, there\u2019s a coffin and, framed in hellfire lighting and big as a fridge, the letters \u201cH.I.V.\u201d It exposes the homophobic subtext lurking in Perry\u2019s work and calls out the moralistic finger-wagging3 the shows \u2014 and by extension the people who love them \u2014 do.\n\nWhere does Perry\u2019s triumph leave a black person who\u2019s skeptical of and alienated by his empire, who feels oppressed by the standard it sets and the bar it lowers? And where does that leave a person who knows all this and finds him fun anyway? These questions are currently fueling a bunch of strong, anxious shows. Perry\u2019s name isn\u2019t always checked, but the spirit of him is there, bouncing off the walls. He\u2019s there in the salaciously dysfunctional couplings of Jeremy O. Harris (\u201cSlave Play,\u201d \u201cDaddy\u201d), in the rambunctious episodic sketches of Jordan E. Cooper (\u201cAin\u2019t No Mo\u2019 \u201d), in the time warps and fraying family ties of Jackie Sibblies Drury (\u201cFairview,\u201d \u201cMarys Seacole\u201d) \u2014 as an idea, as an energy, to be channeled, harnessed and critiqued. The Tyler Perry problem is really an ancient, larger worry about blackness and how to present it. How loud is too loud? How black is too black?\n\nDrama students are steered toward the titans of a serious American theater (O\u2019Neill, Williams, Albee, men). A black drama student very likely arrives having been told long ago that the shoes worthiest of filling belonged to Lorraine Hansberry and August Wilson. These are honorable, admirable, important, comfortable shoes. But the trouble for a young black playwright in the 21st century is that even though it\u2019s apparent that the legends are speaking for you, they might not be speaking to you. Hansberry\u2019s \u201cA Raisin in the Sun\u201d was first performed 60 years ago and so concisely dramatizes a fundamental conundrum of racism and upward black mobility that it retains a sobering philosophical timelessness. And yet, for the play to achieve maximal devastation, it has to stay in 1959.4\n\nWilson has been dead for more than a decade but was sacrosanct even when he was very much among us. His 10 plays took as their project the black experience \u2014 excuse me, The. Black. Experience \u2014 dramatizing it for each decade of the 20th century. In 1911 (\u201cJoe Turner\u2019s Come and Gone\u201d), in the 1920s (\u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d), during the Depression (\u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d), in the late 1950s (\u201cFences\u201d), in the Clinton-era 1990s (\u201cRadio Golf\u201d). The grain, grind and wonder of African-American life \u2014 of estrangement and reunion, assimilation and isolation, flesh and blood and ghosts \u2014 was envisioned as high literature and American tragedy. A character could arrive light as silk and leave rough as burlap, because the past is never quite done with anybody in a Wilson show.\n\nBut what does Wilson have to say about the present? What if a writer in 2019 wants to make a connection to right now? To write what she knows, likes and has been thinking about in addition to what she has been taught? The appeal of Perry is that he works in a kind of permanent present, cramming it full of nonliterary problems like nosy neighbors, nasty kids, marriage counseling and horny old ladies. Philandering husbands, long-suffering wives and foster-care predators come in for a tsking. He conflates soap opera and choir practice. In some shows, somebody offstage will start playing a keyboard in the middle of a scene as if it\u2019s the most natural thing in the world.\n\nHis mix of gratuitousness and blatancy shoots right out of the Chitlin Circuit,5 a century-old touring route through black theaters (or just black spaces) in black communities that emerged in the 1920s, at an apex of racial segregation, when the labor of black art (securing that space, traveling to it, being paid) could put your life at risk. Theater made on the circuit, yesterday and today, tends to be so present-minded that it can be ephemeral \u2014 as close to news as to art. But the bulletins these shows provide, along with the singing and dancing and talent, acknowledge to black audiences that they exist, that some aspect of their lives is worthy of reflection. Occasionally something comes along and sharply aligns spiritual pathos with earthly desire and becomes a runaway-train phenomenon, the way \u201cMama, I Want to Sing!\u201d Vy Higginsen and Ken Wydro\u2019s musical about the church mouse who becomes a pop star, did in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nOn the Chitlin Circuit, black life isn\u2019t aspirational \u2014 it\u2019s deluxed: criminality, venality, lust, vengeance, Jesus, eye rolls, neck rolls, dinner rolls, murder, gossip, mispronunciations and hope. A lot of regional touring black plays from the 1980s and 1990s were crisis-oriented, about drugs and sex and poverty. (\u201cPathologizing\u201d is a worried descriptor that\u2019s been used.) Perry\u2019s plays reupholstered most of the rawness of catastrophe with bougie padding and the pathology with types. His work is full of arrivistes and the nouveau upper middle class, people who seem to have sprung as much from \u201cDynasty\u201d as from \u201cGood Times\u201d and the pages of Black Enterprise magazine, people brought low (and back home) by pride or vanity or greed, by an abusive spouse. These are worlds empty of politics, not just racial politics but intraracial strife. A white man tends to be the least of a black woman\u2019s problems \u2014 usually, it\u2019s the black person she married. Class and comportment are what might send characters to the wrestling ring.\n\nThese are worlds also empty of white people, as black as the worlds of the people who\u2019ve come to see them. A night of watching a sliver of our daily difficulty boxed up as drama, of laughing at our most ludicrous, obstreperous, reduced selves, selves that among black people are recognizable at worst as hyperbolically human, could be a comfort. There is art in that, too.\n\nBut Perry\u2019s descendants are asking what changes when hyperbole is presented in front of white visitors who might receive it as fact. How soon would these visitors despoil all this unspooled, undressed blackness? How soon could your black Eden be transformed into a carnival of stereotypes? How soon would so much casual self-expression curdle into the sort of shame that leaves you reaching for a fig leaf? That shame, that discomfort, these visitors are part of a vital project for this generation of playwrights. They\u2019re interrogating a new pathology: What if white people are the disease?\n\nIn 1996, two years before Perry successfully staged his first play, August Wilson delivered a grand, polarizing address to a group of theater professionals that he called \u201cThe Ground on Which I Stand,\u201d6 in which he argued that in order to preserve artistic freedom, it was in the best interest of the black playwright to work apart from white people. The American theater was the dominion of white experience and a corruptive purveyor of whiteness. His conclusions were spiritual and cultural as well as economic. Black venues wouldn\u2019t survive without black work. But really, he believed that black artists owe it to history to stay in the neighborhood and create among themselves.\n\nThe time has come for black playwrights to confer with one another, to come together to meet each other face to face, to address questions of aesthetics and ways to defend ourselves from the naysayers who would trumpet our talents as insufficient to warrant the same manner of investigation and exploration as the majority. We need to develop guidelines for the protection of our cultural property, our contributions and the influence they accrue. It is time we took the responsibility for our talents in our own hands.\n\nHis audience that day would have been the well-meaning white people who helped make his reputation, who published his plays. He was biting hands. In an article for The New Yorker early the following year, Henry Louis Gates Jr. surveyed the aftershocks, implications and ironies of the speech.7 For one thing, this black theater Wilson was calling for already existed. It\u2019s the Chitlin Circuit, and despite the poor esteem in which it\u2019s held, it\u2019s what black audiences wanted to see. Wilson was demanding a loftier black theater, a Foie Gras Circuit.\n\nIn the meantime, while the other black artists would be heading back to their communities and saving the arts, Wilson would stay behind, filling the void he\u2019d be creating. With no detectable sense of burden, Wilson informs Gates that his connection to white people was born of educational necessity. Basically, he excels at explaining his people to theirs. \u201cThe rush is now on to do anything that\u2019s black,\u201d he says. \u201cLargely through my plays, what the theaters have found out is that they had this white audience that was starving to get a little understanding of what was happening with the black population, because they very seldom come into contact with them, so they\u2019re curious.\u201d\n\nMore than 20 years later, the rush is back on. Producers aren\u2019t as scared of intense, eccentric plays about black life, and audiences are eager to hear from original new voices. There\u2019s also a separate rush among black playwrights who want white people at their shows, in order to shake the ground on which we stand. Their work is being put on in American theater\u2019s capital, where a mostly black audience is no guarantee, even for a black show. Rather than strike out into some new territory or retreat back into the Urban Theater Circuit (which is what we\u2019re supposed to call the Chitlin Circuit now), these playwrights are taking Wilson\u2019s idea of radical separatism in the opposite direction and yet a step further. They\u2019re addressing the relatively few black people in their audience, either pretending the white people aren\u2019t there or yanking comfort away from everybody.\n\nA white audience is a foil for the work and factors into the achievement. At a Tyler Perry play or movie, a black audience has been welcomed, serenaded, flattered and understood. What happens when the chaos of Perry\u2019s realness is presented antagonistically on a New York stage?\n\nJeremy O. Harris\u2019s \u201cSlave Play\u201d starts off as a sex comedy among three interracial couples exploring erotic fantasies on a plantation. The power dynamics in these relationships are slavery\u2019s, and they are on the rocks just as Perry\u2019s \u201cThe Marriage Counselor\u201d and \u201cWhy Did I Get Married?\u201d are about love going bad.8 But Harris is playing games right out of the gate. \u201cSlave Play\u201d opens with one of its characters bent over, twerking, in her antebellum rags, to Rihanna\u2019s \u201cWork.\u201d It\u2019s not unlike the way the cast of a Perry show is introduced singing or, in the middle of a scene, could start doing the Bankhead Bounce or Milly Rock. In \u201cSlave Play,\u201d it\u2019s a way to shatter the mannerism in theater from a bygone period, to connect those clothes and the dire straits of its era to our moment. But having her twerk to \u201cWork\u201d sends a wink to the black people in the audience: It\u2019s about to go down.\n\nJackie Sibblies Drury\u2019s \u201cFairview\u201d opens with a scene of sitcom-like black domesticity whose look and language could be from one of Perry\u2019s plays. A woman is stressfully setting the table while her husband and sister kind of assist. But something with her isn\u2019t right. Her well-to-do polish feels like a worried parody of bougieness. In the second act, the lights dim on the simple comedy we were watching, and unseen white characters begin talking over it, talking about it and then try to talk like it, speaking the way they think these characters would speak: \u201cFine, Mama! Fine! I will run off with Antoine.\u201d And: \u201cHe play the sax and he love me.\u201d It\u2019s a blackness these white spectators presume just by looking at black people on stage. They\u2019re not seeing Huxtable-adjacent characters, the way I am. They look at these polished black people and see \u201cTyler Perry\u2019s Meet the Browns.\u201d It\u2019s that junkie itch for the thrill of minstrel blackness: white people impersonating black people for their own amusement.\n\nThe possession culminates in a showdown between the watched and the watchers. When it\u2019s all over, identities have been turned inside out, the set has been demolished and the daughter of the black family is inviting \u201cthe folks who identify as white\u201d to leave their seats in the audience and \u201ccome up here to where my family has always been,\u201d to \u201clet me and my family go out to where you\u2019ve always been.\u201d And some white folks in the audience actually do go up and stand in the black people\u2019s place, in a house that a race war has trashed, so that whoever else has remained seated (ideally nonwhite people) can gaze upon them. The riot we\u2019ve been watching isn\u2019t funny anymore. For the smattering of black people left behind \u2014 O.K., for me \u2014 the coup of spectatorship and the consequent intimacy was painfully awkward. Our blackness wasn\u2019t unburdened the way it would be at a Perry show. It was powerfully unbearable. It made me wish I were up there with the white people.\n\nAmerica needs a black theater. But black theater needs to be all over America, challenging, questioning, provoking, freaking people out, because these actually aren\u2019t only black plays. They\u2019re plays about race, and the experience of one race watching another, watching it not only suffer and struggle but also inspect itself. The rush Wilson was talking about is also simply a rush of nerve and style, avant-gardism on Tyler Perry drugs. These younger authors prioritize structure, pacing, moral suspense and authentic weirdness that Perry\u2019s plays don\u2019t have; they believe in rigor. But they seem to have at least considered what might happen when you take Perry\u2019s blackness-for-black-people and make it yours. His bawdiness, flamboyance and excess, his ruthless sense of entertainment and spontaneity: It\u2019s alive in this new work, sloshing around with all its other allusions, pungent on the tongue. Maybe Perry\u2019s not a great artist. But there is great art in him. There must be, because right now some visionary playwrights are using it to make their own.", "description": "A circle of young black playwrights is doing some of the most vital work in American theater.
