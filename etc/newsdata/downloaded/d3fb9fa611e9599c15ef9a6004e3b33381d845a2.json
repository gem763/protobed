We want to find out what happened with 2016,' he said. 'I don\u2019t care about Biden\u2019s campaign. But I do care about corruption. His campaign, that's up to him.'\n\nRepeating himself near another group of reporters further down the line, he asserted: 'I don\u2019t care about politics, I don\u2019t care about anything. I care about corruption.'\n\nDonald Trump maintained Friday that he was right to request assistance from foreign governments to investigate alleged corruption\n\nHe insisted that the former vice president was never his pick to be the Democratic nominee in next year's contest, so he had no motivation to take him out of the competition early.\n\nTrump contended that every call he'd ever had with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky or any other foreign leader was entirely appropriate and aimed squarely at reducing political corruption.\n\nHe repeated his new mantra - 'no quid pro quo - in response to nearly every query.\n\n'It was quid pro quo? Well, there was none,' he said. 'That's the whole ballgame. But now, the Democrats don't bring that up anymore because they lost.'\n\nHe said his trade negotiations with China would not be predicated on a probe into the Bidens and would only be agreed to when representatives of Xi Jinping's government come to Washington next week if the deal benefits American workers and companies.\n\n'One thing has nothing to do with the other,' he stated.\n\nHe predicted that he'd ultimately be vindicated at the ballot box. 'I really do believe that they're going to pay a tremendous price in the polls,' he said of Democrats.\n\nThe president said Republicans also have the benefit of being more united than Democrats on the subject of impeachment.\n\nHe immediately sidestepped a question, however, about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's assertion he would have no choice but to hold a floor vote, if the House passes articles of impeachment.\n\n'Well I don't know about Mitch. I have a lot of respect for Mitch McConnell. I saw his statements, and he thinks this is ridiculous. He thinks it's unfair. I saw his statement yesterday he put out where he read my phone conversation, and he thought it was a wonderful conversation. And it was.\n\n'But, see the Democrats don't talk about anymore. They try and go to other things. these people are looking for anything they can get, because they know they're going to lose the election. and we're in election season now. For them to be doing this now, it's never been done,' he said.\n\nHe'd said earlier in the morning that he believed he had an 'obligation' to root out corruption that was not in away tied to his politics.\n\n'As President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!' he tweeted.\n\nA chain of texts between the State Department officials the House Intelligence Committee released late Thursday evening painted an unflattering portrait of the ask.\n\nTrump administration officials appeared leveraging White House meeting with Ukraine's president in exchange for a public commitment to investigate a company tired to Hunter Biden.\n\nUkraine's Volodymyr Zelensky said in September, with Trump at his side, that he never felt pressured to launch a probe, and the U.S. president pointed to the admission in a Friday tweet proclaiming his innocence.\n\n'The Washington Times, \u201cUkraine envoy blows \u2018massive hole\u2019 into Democrat accusations. Republicans at hearing find no Trump Pressure.\u201d The Ukrainian President also strongly stated that NO pressure was put on him. Case Closed!' he said.\n\nTrump said earlier in the morning that he believed he had an 'obligation' to root out corruption that was not in away tied to his politics\n\nIn an attempt to undermine the Democrat who released the embarrassing texts, the president pointed out that House Intel Chair Adam Schiff withheld information about the whistle-blower who put the relationship with Ukraine under a microscope.\n\n'The Whistleblower, who had the facts wrong about the phone call, reached out, and more, to the Democrat controlled House Intelligence Committee. Schiff never told us about this!' he said.\n\nAlso on Friday, Ukraine\u00b4s Prosecutor General said that his office would review the case of an energy company linked to Hunter Biden \u2013 just a day after President Donald Trump called for the country to investigate the Bidens.\n\nThe prosecutor said he is reviewing all the cases that were closed by his predecessors \u2013 including several related to the owner of gas company Burisma Holdings where former Vice President Joe Biden\u00b4s son sat on the board of directors and was reportedly compensated $50,000 a month.\n\nThe newly-announced action in Ukraine also comes amid additional revelations about Trump administration efforts to push an investigation \u2013 including by leveraging a presidential visit.\n\nTrump's former envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker departs following his closed-door testimony yesterday during which he handed over a tranche of texts which were released last\n\nKurt Volker sent this text, released by House Democrats in a 23-page tranche last night, just hours before the phone call between Trump and Zelensky which is at the center of the impeachment probe\n\nTrump 's aides told the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden and the 2016 election if he wanted a visit to Washington, 23 pages of texts released by Adam Schiff and House Democrats revealed.\n\nKurt Volker, Trump's former envoy to Ukraine, told an aide to Zelensky that the U.S. would only 'nail down' a date once the Ukrainian president promised to 'get to the bottom of what happened' - reference to an unproven theory Joe Biden, as vice president, interfered in a Ukrainian investigation into a gas company that had Hunter Biden on its board.\n\nVolker sent the text, released late Thursday night, just hours before the phone call between Trump and Zelensky that sparked the impeachment probe.\n\nThe tranche of texts - handed over by Volker as part of his testimony to lawmakers in their impeachment inquiry of Trump - revealed the pressure the president's aides put on the Ukraine to give credence to an unsubstantiated theory of corruption on the part of Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nTrump's tweets were the newest chapter in the episode that began Thursday when the president said China should open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.\n\nHis seeking the aid of a foreign power with whom he is locked in a trade war, days after congratulating its leaders on 70 years of Communist rule, had Democrats like Schiff in an uproar.\n\nHe also answered the burning question he dodged three times the day before, confirming to DailyMail.com that he hoped his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky would result in 'a major investigation' of the Bidens.\n\nHe also called Adam Schiff, the Democrat chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a 'stone cold liar,' stepping up his attacks on one of his main enemies, after it emerged his committee knew about the whistle-blower complaint before it was made.\n\nThe intention behind Trump's momentary mention of Biden and his son Hunter during the call has become a sticking point among congressional investigators and journalists.\n\nAn impatient, nail-spitting president refused to address the topic during a joint press conference Wednesday with the president of Finland, berating a reporter for repeating the question and trying his patience.\n\nBut on the White House South Lawn Thursday he said that if Ukraine 'were honest about it,' it 'would start a major investigation against the Bidens. It's a very simple answer.'\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that both Ukraine and China should probe possible corruption by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden\n\nThe president spoke to reporters as he left for Florida, standing on the driveway adjacent to the South Lawn of the White House\n\nJoe Biden says he's 'not going away' and insists he can beat Trump in 2020, even as the president pummels him with accusations of international graft\n\n'Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens,' Trump insisted, 'because what happened with the Bidens in China is just about as bad.\n\n'President Zelensky \u2013 if it were me I would recommend they start an investigation into the Bidens because nobody has any doubt that they aren't crooked,' he added, as he prepared to leave for a trip to The Villages in Florida.\n\n'So if I were the president I would certainly recommend that of Ukraine.'\n\nAsked if he had requested Chin's president Xi Jinping to launch a corruption investigation focusing on the Bidens, Trump replied: 'I haven't, but it's certainly something we can start thinking about.'\n\nTrump controversially congratulated China on the 70th anniversary of the declaration of its modern Communist state earlier this week and talks on a trade deal between the U.S. and Beijing are to resume next week.\n\nHe said he suspects Xi 'does not like being under that kind of scrutiny where billions of dollars is taken out of his country by a guy that just got kicked out of the Navy.'\n\nThat was a reference to Hunter Biden, who was discharged from his officer's commission in the Navy Reserve early in 2014 after testing positive for cocaine.\n\n'He got kicked out of the navy. All of a sudden he's getting billions of dollars. You know what they call that? They call that a payoff.'\n\n\n\nJoe Biden boasted last year about threatening to scuttle $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine's government didn't fire the lead prosecutor investigating the energy company where his son Hunter held a lucrative Board of Directors seat.\n\n'I looked at them and said: \"I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money\",' the former VP recalled in a January 2018 speech. 'Well, son of a b***h. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.'\n\nTrump said he hasn't directly asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to investigate the Bidens, but that it may be a future consideration. He congratulated China's leadership on the 70th anniversary of the formation of their Communist state this week and his trade negotiators resume trade talks with them next week\n\nThe president dodged a Reuters reporter's question on Wednesday about his intentions in the call with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump got progressively angrier on Wednesday as the reporter pressed him three times; he answered the question on Thursday\n\nTrump has also lambasted the former vice president for taking Hunter Biden to China aboard Air Force Two in 2013, while he was in office, and claimed that he helpe to facilitate a meeting with Chinese bankers that allegedly resulted in a $1.5 billion investment in the younger Biden's venture capital fund.\n\nThat allegation has had less publicity but has been repeatedly mentioned by Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, in a string of media appearances.\n\nIt centers on what happened when the vice-president went to China for two days as part of a East Asian swing in December 2013, taking with him Hunter and Hunter's daughter Finnegan.\n\nBiden frequently took family members, particularly his grandchildren, on foreign trips.\n\nBut at the time Hunter was setting up a Chinese private equity fund, called BHR Partners, along with Devon Archer, the business partner who was also to join the board of Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company at the center of Trump's claims of corruption in that country.\n\nBHR's first company documents were filed the month before the Bidens flew to China. Hunter was not a partner in the fund - meaning he had no financial stake, but was on an advisory board.\n\nOne of the partners in the fund was Jonathan Li, a Chinese banker, who Hunter acknowledges he met on the trip with his father to China.\n\nHunter denied to the New Yorker in July that he transacted any business with Li on the trip and said: 'How do I go to Beijing, halfway around the world, and not see them for a cup of coffee?'\n\nTrump and Giuliani have both touted a claim that Hunter took '$1.5 billion' from China for the fund.\n\nIt was first made by conservative investigative author Peter Schweizer - the author of Clinton Cash - in his 2018 book Secret Empires.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that 'affiliates' of the fund said it was planned to raise $1.5 billion, but Hunter's spokesman, George Mesires, said that it raised just $4.2 million. After his father left office, Biden bought a 10 per cent stake in the fund for $420,000, Mesires said.\n\nNew claim: Trump has also lambasted the former vice president for taking Hunter Biden to China aboard Air Force Two in 2013. While there he met Vice Premier Li Yuanchao - while Hunter met a business partner\n\nUkraine links: Joe Biden made multiple trips there and demanded action on corruption; Hunter was on the board of a natural gas firm which faced money-laundering accusations\n\n'To date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors,' Mesires told the Washington Post.\n\nIn Ukraine, current officials have not accused either Biden of wrongdoing in connection with the company, Burisma Holdings. Former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko told The Washington Post last week that 'from the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, [Hunter Biden] did not violate anything.'\n\nThe president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, however, tells a different story.\n\nHe wrote in notes from a January 2019 phone call with the fired prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, that Shokin claimed he was forced to back off his investigation into Burisma.\n\nShokin, who was himself accused of rampant corruption during his time in office, told Giuliani he stopped his probe 'out of fear of the United States' after America's top diplomat told him to use 'white gloves.'\n\n'According to Mr. Shokin, that implied do nothing,' Giuliani's notes say.\n\nShokin, he wrote, recalled being told that Joe Biden was holding up aid payments to Ukraine because of the investigation.\n\nAs he fumed on Wednesday in the East Room, Trump lashed out at a Reuters reporter and called his question \u2013 the same one he answered Thursday \u2013 an example of 'corrupt news.'\n\n'It's a whole hoax, and you know who's playing into the hoax? People like you,' he said.\n\nThe president badgered the reporter, Jeff Mason of Reuters, to stop being 'rude' and question Finnish president Sauli Niinist\u00f6 instead.\n\n'Are you talking to me? Listen, are you ready? We have the president of Finland. Ask him a question!' he boomed.\n\n'Did you hear me? Did you hear me? Ask him a question!'\n\nAfter Mason pressed his query to Trump a third time, the president ended the press conference and walked out.", "description": "Donald Trump maintained Friday that he had an 'obligation' to request assistance from foreign governments to investigate alleged corruption and his conduct was not politically motivated.", "authors": ["Francesca Chambers", "Senior White House Correspondent For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/20/19309772-0-image-a-46_1570216958882.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
