So after being grounded for two consecutive games, Reich went back to the basics.\n\nHe challenged his players to clean up mistakes, clear out running lanes and re-establish their edge. The response: a head-turning win Sunday night in Kansas City.\n\n\u201cThe best teams I\u2019ve been on have always been able to run the football and run it effectively,\u201d Reich said Monday on a conference call with local reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy. You get excited about what we just did and then the next week you play somebody - you really have got to go out and prove it every week.\u201d\n\nThe Colts (3-2) appeared headed in that direction after opening the season with 370 yards rushing in road games against the Los Angeles Chargers and Tennessee Titans. Over the next two weeks, home games against Atlanta and Oakland, Indy ran for just 160 yards.\n\nBut instead of changing the game plan, Reich stuck with it - and the results were even better than the Colts expected.\n\nThird-year running back Marlon Mack logged 29 carries for 132 yards. The traditionally pass-happy Colts ran 45 times for 180 yards and Indy controlled the ball for all but 7\u00bd minutes in the second half, steamrolling the Chiefs\u2019 injury-battered defensive line.\n\nMeanwhile, reigning MVP Patrick Mahomes spent most of the second half watching harmlessly from the sideline as Mack attacked holes like a speeding truck.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best way (to win),\u201d quarterback Jacoby Brissett said. \u201cThat\u2019s when you know you take a team\u2019s will, when they know you\u2019re running the ball and we know we\u2019re running the ball. But we believe our guys were better and (Sunday night) that was the case.\u201d\n\nReich believes the Colts can now win consistently by grinding out yards and wearing down defenses.\n\nWhy not?\n\nWhen general manager Chris Ballard plugged All-Pro Quenton Nelson in between two first-round draft picks, left tackle Anthony Castonzo and center Ryan Kelly, the offensive line started establishing itself. And when Ballard struck gold with right guard Mark Glowinski, a waiver wire pickup, and second-round pick Braden Smith at right tackle, the Colts suddenly had one of the league\u2019s strongest units.\n\nThe combination convinced Reich that the Colts had the perfect ingredients to be a top-five rushing offense - long before Andrew Luck suddenly retired in August.\n\nNow, everybody appears to be on board.\n\nBrissett didn\u2019t mind throwing 29 passes for 151 yards Sunday, given the outcome. And Reich explained Pro Bowl receiver T.Y. Hilton and Pro Bowl tight end Eric Ebron were as excited to throw blocks in Kansas City as they were catching passes.\n\nIt could be the Colts\u2018 new blueprint for success.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a reasonable \u2018perfect\u2019 game? It\u2019s 150 yards rushing, 250 passing and mixing it up like that,\u201d Reich said. \u201cWhen you get in the game and you factor in how good their offense is and the idea of controlling the ball, controlling the line of scrimmage, playing in that environment to take the crowd out of it, all of those factors, then that\u2019s when you have to move that dial the other way. The perfect game in Arrowhead (Stadium) is probably something more like what we saw last night.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThrowback football. In a league where wide-open, high-octane offenses have become all the rage, the Colts are winning with an old playbook: running the ball and stopping the run.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nStretching the field. While Brissett has kept the turnovers down and put points on the scoreboard, he\u2019s averaging 6.4 yards per throw and ranks near the bottom of the league in yards passing (212.4 per game).\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nJustin Houston. The longtime Kansas City pass rusher had quite a homecoming, recording four tackles including a first-half sack of Patrick Mahomes and a fourth-down stop to set up the field goal that gave Indy an insurmountable 19-10 lead late in the fourth quarter.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nColts receivers. Hilton caught four passes for 37 yards Sunday night but the receiving corps as a whole had six receptions for 52 yards.\n\nINJURED\n\nDE Kemoko Turay will miss the rest of the season with a broken and dislocated left ankle. He will finish his second NFL season on injured reserve after becoming an emerging threat in the Colts\u2018 pass rush.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n36 - The Chiefs\u2019 rushing total was the fewest yards allowed by an Indy defense since the Minnesota Vikings rushed for 34 yards in December 2016.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe bye week comes at a perfect time for players like Hilton (quad) and All-Pro linebacker Darius Leonard (concussion) to get healthy. But the Colts also need to take advantage of the next four games on the schedule: hosting AFC South co-leader Houston and the Denver Broncos before heading to Pittsburgh and returning home to face Miami.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Coach Frank Reich expects the Indianapolis Colts to run efficiently each week.
