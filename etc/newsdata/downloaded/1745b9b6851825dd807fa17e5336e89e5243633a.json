The doctor hasn't been here for ten days,\" he said in exasperation.\n\nThe Bihac region hosts between \"between 6,000 and 7,000 migrants\" in all, said interior ministry official Nermin Kljajic.\n\nAround half live in four camps run by the International Organization for Migration, he said.\n\nWhile groups periodically depart in bids to cross the Croatian border, their spots are taken by around 150 new migrants arriving each night by train from Sarajevo.\n\nThis week, an AFP journalist saw police halt new arrivals at a station 50 kilometres (31 miles) from Bihac in a fruitless attempt to keep them away.\n\nAfter being forced off the train, the wearied travellers continued their journey by foot.\n\n- Winter is coming -\n\nBosnian authorities say they want to move the camp before winter hits but have been unable to agree on a new location.\n\nThe European Union has given Bosnia 34 million euros ($37.8 million) since 2018 to help manage the migrant crisis and the Red Cross distributes clothes and two meals a day in Vucjak.\n\nThe only electricity comes from a generator that charges mobile phones, crucial devices for migrants to chart their journeys west.\n\nThe Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatovic, criticised the camp's \"deplorable\" conditions, and warned that \"with winter coming, the situation cannot but worsen.\"\n\nAs cold temperatures draw near, makeshift sites like Vucjak risk becoming a humanitarian crisis.\n\n\"It is good to bring water, to collect garbage. But who will take care of the large number of migrants with scabies, tuberculosis and hepatitis?\" local manager Selam Midzic asked.", "description": "No running water, putrid portable toilets and surrounding woods littered with land mines -- these are the bleak conditions of a camp where hundreds of migrants brace for winter in Bosnia.  \"It's the jungle,\" says Mohammad Nawaz, a 30-year-old Pakistani living in the tent-city built on a", "authors": ["Rusmir Smajilhodzic"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MQMgofRU8qGrFL6AvWj3mw--~B/aD00NzE7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_sg/News/AFP/d391b5a2c89ffe0e5c58505cc615d8e78d459522.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
