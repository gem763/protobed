The Dolphins have fielded those calls but in Tunsil's case, haven't acted on them to this point.\"\n\nBeasley also spoke with a source on Aug. 29 who said \"guys would legit revolt\" if the team traded Tunsil.\n\nHowever, the trade winds kept blowing, and Armando Salguero of the Miami Herald wrote on Aug. 29 that the Houston Texans wanted Tunsil in a potential deal that would send outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney to Miami.\n\nEventually, Tunsil found himself in Houston following the surprising move, ending the 25-year-old's three-season Fins tenure.\n\nAfter starting as a left guard in 2016, the former Ole Miss star moved to left tackle, where he's protected the blind side ever since. He's played and started 44 career games in total.\n\nThe Pro Football Writers Association named Tunsil to its All-Rookie Team in 2016, and Pro Football Focus named him the league's top rookie guard.\n\nThe arrow is trending up with Tunsil, as PFF also credited him with having his best overall, run-block and pass-block grades in 2018.\n\nTunsil's pro career got off to an inauspicious start when video of him smoking through a gas mask surfaced on the night of the 2016 NFL draft. That was in addition to allegations Tunsil took money while still at Ole Miss (he later admitted doing so).\n\nThe former top prospect fell down the draft boards, but the Dolphins scooped him up at No. 13.\n\nHowever, Miami will need a new blindside protector for the foreseeable future with Tunsil now a Texan.\n\nHouston now adds a much-needed left tackle to protect franchise quarterback Deshaun Watson while also adding a reliable wideout in Stills. The 27-year-old receiver has played all but two games in his six-year NFL career with an average of 689.7 receiving yards per season.\n\nIt could take some pressure off DeAndre Hopkins and make the passing attack even more dangerous in Houston.", "description": "The Miami Dolphins announced on Sunday that they've dealt offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil and wide receiver  Kenny Stills  to the Houston Texans in a major trade involving several draft picks...", "authors": ["Paul Kasabian"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/825/433/hi-res-ac91074624d12e8aa61dced468757835_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75"}
