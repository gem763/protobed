Antalya and Dalaman in Turkey were Thomas Cook Airlines' most popular destinations for UK travellers, according to data from airline database Cirium.\n\nA company spokeswoman said that the route announcement had been a long time coming and was unconnected to Thomas Cook's failure. BA already operates a summer flight to Dalaman.\n\nThomas Cook's bankruptcy, which triggered a major repatriation effort aided by BA, easyJet and Virgin Atlantic, has prompted airlines to consider ways to replace its capacity to holiday destinations or bid for its airport slots.\n\nBesides BA, operators that were already flying to the two Turkish destinations from London or Manchester before Thomas Cook's collapse include easyJet, Dart Group's Jet2, tour group TUI, Turkish Airlines and its SunExpress joint venture with Lufthansa.\n\nUnless Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal, HSBC analyst Andrew Lobbenberg predicted on Wednesday, \"easyJet should benefit this winter from the failure of Thomas Cook\".\n\nWithin days of its demise, easyJet began offering 15% discounts to Thomas Cook customers who had not yet left for their vacations and wanted to rebook.\n\nTurkey expects an increase in flights by easyJet and Jet2 as well as BA, the country's tourism minister has said. SunExpress laid on additional lower-fare flights from London Luton airport and has been targeting Thomas Cook customers left in the lurch, a spokesman said.\n\nEasyJet is also looking at Thomas Cook assets, Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said recently - while ruling out a bid for its German Condor business, being kept airborne by a government bridging loan.\n\nLeading European budget operator Ryanair may lease Airbus aircraft returned by Thomas Cook and deploy them at its Austrian carrier Lauda, group CEO Michael O'Leary said last week. He too denied any interest in Condor.\n\nA spokesman for the UK court-appointed official overseeing Thomas Cook's liquidation declined to comment on the status of bidding for its airport slots.
