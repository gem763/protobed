The one-time acting head of the country\u2019s most powerful investigative agency allegedly misled internal watchdogs about his role in releasing information to a journalist. Mr. McCabe protests his innocence, but one does not have to accept his side to conclude that his case does not warrant prosecution. As Lawfare\u2019s Benjamin Wittes pointed out, other FBI officials who have committed similar alleged misdeeds were punished in other ways, such as by firing. Mr. McCabe already has been fired.\n\nSo what makes Mr. McCabe\u2019s case different? Perhaps it is that President Trump has routinely and publicly excoriated him \u2014 more than 50 times, according to Mr. McCabe\u2019s lawyers, and with his usual subtlety and restraint: \u201cHe knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\u201d; \u201cHe LIED! LIED! LIED!\u201d; \u201cTreason!\u201d; \u201cAndy McCabe is a major sleazebag\u201d; \u201cWhy isn\u2019t disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated?\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department inspector general released last April a report that gave ammunition to those accusing Mr. McCabe of lying about his role in authorizing two FBI officials to speak on background to a reporter, providing material about his handling of an investigation into the Clinton Foundation \u2014 material suggesting he resisted shutting down the probe as the 2016 election approached. Perhaps one could argue that, as one of the FBI\u2019s most senior bosses, Mr. McCabe bore more responsibility than the average agent to be honest with internal investigators who later inquired about the resulting news report. Yet he has already paid a stiff price. Not only was he fired, he was terminated in a particularly nasty fashion \u2014 just hours before he would have qualified for his pension.\n\nThe plot thickened further this month when Mr. McCabe appeared to be on the verge of being indicted, as prosecutors recalled a grand jury after a long absence from the federal courthouse. Yet Mr. McCabe remains uncharged, fueling speculation that the grand jury refused to indict him, which would be a highly unusual expression of no-confidence in the prosecution case. Mr. McCabe\u2019s lawyers demanded an explanation from the Justice Department but have obtained none. There are a few possible explanations for the lack of action. But if the grand jury refused to indict, it would be a remarkable turn, as the standards for grand jury indictment are minimal.\n\nMr. McCabe has been punished proportionately for his alleged wrongs. More and more, the case against him looks like an act of political vengeance, draining the already-depleted credibility of the Trump Justice Department. If the case against Mr. McCabe is still active, it should end.", "description": "One of President Trump\u2019s favorite punching bags does not need to be prosecuted.", "authors": ["Editorial Board", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jfCajUwg3Tiw1FT_7UvdOeBLsaw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RZWDWSRVIEI6TL23WUNX74ZC5E.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
