Regardless, the GOP shouldn't dismiss this inquiry as a conspiracy to take down Trump.\n\nLike most of my fellow Republicans, I\u2019m convinced that impeaching the president amounts to an irresponsible, destructive strategy \u2014 poisonous to political progress and damaging to the very Democrats who embrace the idea.\n\nBut at the same time, I\u2019m outraged by the ignorant, dishonest line of attack with which the president and his apologists push back against the advocates of impeachment. We\u2019ve heard it again and again: President Donald Trump\u2019s defenders insist that by promoting the president\u2019s removal from office, the diabolical Dems seek to overturn his glorious victory of 2016. According to this illogic, the impeachment inquiry amounts to a \"coup\" by the nefarious forces of the Deep State and the Washington swamp to rid themselves of a disruptive outsider and to discard the votes of 63 million patriotic Americans who put him in power to shake things up.\n\nRepublicans would still control the White House if Trump were impeached\n\nThese arguments collapse in the face of one powerfully pertinent question: What would happen in the (extremely) unlikely event that the Pelosi platoons miraculously persuaded 20 Republican Senators to join unified Democrats in voting for Trump\u2019s removal?\n\nThe result wouldn\u2019t be instant takeover by the president\u2019s implacable opponents; instead, the expulsion of the incumbent would mean installation of Vice President Mike Pence, with the prospect that a big surge in sympathy could carry him to victory for a term of his own.\n\nDivert the attention: President Trump should debate his 2020 Republican challengers to distract from impeachment\n\nBut regardless of the outcome of that election, a Pence ascension to the presidency before November, 2020 would mean that the votes of Trump enthusiasts were being validated, not discarded. After all, every one of those 63 million who cast ballots for Trump voted for Pence at the same time. The results of a successful impeachment and removal wouldn\u2019t be replacement of the current incumbent by some alien, hostile force but the elevation of the very individual he chose as his replacement \u2014 a choice enthusiastically endorsed by his supporters.\n\nSometimes, impeachment is necessary\n\nFurthermore, the argument that an impeachment drive amounts to the circumvention of the will of the people suggests that it\u2019s never right to use the appropriate constitutional provisions to oust a sitting president. Consider the situation of the unfortunate Richard Nixon: He had just won an epic landslide in 1972, carrying 49 of the 50 states and drawing 61% of the popular vote to secure his re-election. Yet, when Democrats ramped up the impeachment process less than a year after the balloting, it was hardly persuasive to suggest that they were attempting to overturn the results to thwart the popular will.\n\nRally in Lake Charles, Louisiana, on Oct. 11, 2019.

Smith/epa-EFE)\n\nLike the Democrats who confront Trump today, and like the Republicans who impeached Bill Clinton in 1998, Nixon\u2019s critics didn\u2019t attempt a coup, but they did insist that the president\u2019s dubious deeds required meaningful consequences or else future leaders might repeat those abuses.\n\nThe goal was drawing lines to stop presidential overreach \u2014 not stealing power. In Nixon\u2019s case, leaders of the president\u2019s own party came to accept that logic and pleaded for his resignation. In the case of Bill Clinton, public and president rejected the impeachment drive, on the basis that his sex-scandal prevarications never constituted a serious threat to constitutional order.\n\nUSA TODAY Editorial Board: Nancy Pelosi doesn't have to hold House impeachment inquiry vote. But the speaker should.\n\nWhatever the final reckoning on Trump\u2019s excesses, the best argument against impeachment is that there\u2019s a much better way to rebuke his conduct in office: Within a matter of months, the people themselves will get the chance to express their judgment at the ballot box. In the midst of their second terms, Clinton and Nixon couldn\u2019t be voted out \u2014 they were already term-limited \u2014 and in 1868, Andrew Johnson wasn\u2019t a candidate for re-election when the House impeached him.\n\nWith Trump, the electoral alternative represents the right means to terminate his presidency, with far less divisive consequences than the dire expedient of impeachment. A \u201cno\u201d vote to Trump\u2019s leadership by tens of millions of ordinary citizens would send a stronger, more conclusive message than the far-fetched fantasy of corralling 67 Senators for a premature ejection just months before the scheduled election.\n\nThat popular verdict of disapproval remains a distinct possibility for November of next year, but it becomes less likely with each passing week the Democrats waste their time and our attention with their inexplicable push for a Pence presidency.\n\nMichael Medved, a member of USA TODAYs Board of Contributors, hosts a daily radio broadcast heard from coast to coast.
