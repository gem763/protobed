What can I do? I can just accept the decision of the jury but for sure I don\u2019t agree with them because I think I didn\u2019t do something wrong in the sprint.\u201d\n\nCavendish broke his shoulder blade in the crash and has withdrawn from the Tour. The Manxman said there were no hard feelings.\n\n\u201cYes, he [Sagan] called me last night. I didn\u2019t get home from the hospital until gone 11 O\u2019 clock. I had a message from him \u201care you still up\u201d and he gave me a call and we spoke about everything.\n\n\u201cWe have a good relationship, we are friends and colleagues and we have massive respect for each other. I think there are no personal feelings .\n\n\u201cThe commissars are there for a reason, to make the calls. It takes big balls to throw a World Champion out of the Tour of France.\u201d\n\nSagan was initially given a 30-second penalty and docked 80 points in the green jersey competition. But after video analysis the judges convened a press conference to announce that the five-time green jersey winner would be sent home.", "description": "Peter Sagan, the world road race champion, says he has come to terms with his disqualification from the Tour de France but he does not agree with the decision.", "authors": ["Everton Gayle"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/376718/1000x563_376718.jpg", "published_at": "2017-07-05"}
