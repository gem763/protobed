It's human nature to associate ourselves with like-minded people with whom we feel the most comfortable. The ultra wealthy and successful, however, are a lot more selective when it comes to who they allow into their inner circle. Nearly all of the self-made millionaires I interviewed said one of their top priorities was cultivating \"rich relationships\" and avoiding the \"toxic\" ones.\n\n'Rich relationships' are about mindset, not money\n\nIt's important to note that a \"rich relationship\" is defined by mindset, rather than wealth. In other words, individuals who contribute to rich relationships don't necessarily have big bank accounts (though they do know how to save money and don't spend recklessly), but they all have lofty goals and aspirations \u2014 and they spend much of their time trying to achieve them. \"I limit my exposure to toxic, negative people,\" one individual in the wealthy group of my study told me. \"Some of them may bring you down and infect you with their negativity, which can undermine your ability to creatively find solutions to problems and overcome obstacles.\" And it makes sense, doesn't it? Those with a positive attitude are better able to stay focused on seeking and finding solutions to their problems. Positivity can make you a problem-solver, whereas negativity can make you a problem-finder. Based on my research, individuals who contribute to rich relationships have at least one or several of the following traits: Positive mental outlook: They're the entire opposite of downers; they bring an upbeat and optimistic type of energy to the table.\n\nThey're the entire opposite of downers; they bring an upbeat and optimistic type of energy to the table.

As for the people who often contribute to \"toxic relationships,\" they usually have a very pessimistic view on everything and a \"poor, poor me\" attitude. They rarely take any sort of responsibility for the circumstances in life.\n\nNurturing 'rich relationships'", "description": "Those with a positive attitude are better able to stay focused on seeking and finding solutions to their problems.
