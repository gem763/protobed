They are not alone in their adoration for their home, with its two large bedrooms, sunny back garden and high ceilings.\n\nGoldsmith Street, a development of 105 brick properties on the outskirts of the city centre, on Tuesday became the first social housing project to be awarded the Stirling architecture prize. The judges hailed the development, owned wholly by the city council, as a \u201cmodest masterpiece\u201d, saying it represented \u201chigh-quality architecture in its purest, most environmentally and socially conscious form\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe ceilings are really high and there\u2019s loads of storage,\u201d said Jenkins, 22, who works as a beautician. \u201cThe boys share a bedroom but it\u2019s so big it could be two bedrooms. There\u2019s so much space that honestly you don\u2019t know what to do with it.\u201d\n\nThe estate, which was designed by a London firm, Mikhail Riches, is built to German Passivhaus standards, a rigorous system that reduces a building\u2019s ecological footprint. The houses are designed to be as airtight as possible, with a mechanical heat and ventilation system that circulates air through the rooms. Heating bills should theoretically be about \u00a3150 a year.\n\nTenants \u2013 who started moving in last November \u2013 reported lower heating costs, but many had been put on an initial standard rate by energy providers until they could prove their consumption was lower, so they had not yet seen the promised savings. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that you live in a Passivhaus house,\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Some have front and back gardens.

They rejected the modern standard of having streets 21 metres wide and instead put the rows of houses 14 metres away from one another. This enabled them to fit in more self-contained houses with gardens, rather than blocks of flats, and had the added benefit of slowing traffic.\n\n\u201cA house with a back garden is a preferable form of housing for a family,\u201d said the architect Annalie Riches. \u201cHere, everybody has a front door on to the street and a garden \u2013 some have front gardens and back gardens. And a lot of them get access to shared communal play spaces as well.\u201d\n\nHaving a back garden has been transformational for Jenkins. \u201cThe way that my boys play now and experiment and see the world is very different from when we were living in our last council flat,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTommy is talking much more and he understands things better. All of a sudden his world has opened up. He hadn\u2019t really seen bugs before. We\u2019d go to the park, but it\u2019s not the same as walking out into your back garden and seeing spiders.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nEmma Westgate, 23, loved her new house as soon as she moved in with her two children. \u201cThe place I used to live was horrible and there was black mould in the bathroom, so getting this place was a nice fresh start.\u201d\n\nShe said the move had had a huge positive impact on her mental health. \u201cWhere I used to live put me in a really bad place,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel so much better living here. I\u2019ve got two lovely neighbours and I feel like I want to have people round.\u201d\n\nNot all the feedback from tenants is good, however. Many complained that the houses\u2019 fittings were breaking and they had struggled to keep their homes cool during the record-breaking temperatures this summer. Westgate said her toilet leaked and her taps had broken. \u201cThe longer we live here, the more I notice little things that are wrong, but it\u2019s stuff that we can improve on,\u201d she said.\n\nLaura, 23, a personal assistant and carer with two children, has her issues with the Passivhaus system. \u201cThey\u2019ve given us a ringbinder of instructions to understand it, but I\u2019m not very good at understanding paperwork. You kind of need someone to talk you through it,\u201d she said.\n\nShe resents the fact that she can\u2019t install floating shelves or mount her TV to the wall because using long screws could pierce the insulating membrane. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know what you\u2019re doing or you\u2019ll break the house,\u201d she said.\n\nUnder the Right to Buy scheme, tenants will be able to purchase their homes after they have lived there for three years \u2013 although because of the cost to the council of building the estate, any discount will be capped at \u00a312,000. For Jenkins, it is a no-brainer. \u201cI love this place,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d definitely like to buy it if I can.\u201d", "description": "For residents of eco-friendly Goldsmith Street, heating bills could be as little as \u00a3150 a year", "authors": ["Frances Perraudin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/105d94131330c80a7e2a4704ba409dfd992944e7/0_144_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=008c343eb6e145720d7c3cab02b8ec35", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
