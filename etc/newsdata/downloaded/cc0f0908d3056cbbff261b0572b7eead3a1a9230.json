In a brief phone interview, Mr. Reid said Mr. Sanders \u201clooked really good.\u201d\n\nHe said Mr. Sanders had been sitting in a big chair but \u201cjumped right up\u201d when he arrived and that the two spoke for about a half-hour, on topics including health care and his grandson, who works for Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign as a videographer. With Mr. Sanders were his wife; Faiz Shakir, his campaign manager; and Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager, he said.\n\n\u201cBernie is not a backslapping joke teller; he\u2019s a very serious man always,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cHe feels good, he smiled.\u201d\n\nInternally, the campaign is trying to keep its staff motivated. Two advisers, Nina Turner and Jeff Weaver, led an all-staff conference call on Thursday, a campaign aide said, that appeared aimed at energizing the staff. \u201cWe are not taking our foot off the gas,\u201d Ms. Turner said.\n\nStill, the incident is likely to intensify the focus on Mr. Sanders\u2019s age, but also on age generally in the Democratic race, where the three top candidates \u2014 Mr. Sanders, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren \u2014 are all in their 70s.\n\nBut if allies are projecting optimism about his ability to return to the race in full form, the medical episode has also cast a shadow over his candidacy just as he was trying to reinvigorate his campaign. In recent weeks, he has tried to improve his standing in the race by overtly stressing his electability \u2014 an attempt to draw a contrast to Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, who has continued to surge. On Tuesday, the Sanders campaign trumpeted its $25.3 million third-quarter fund-raising haul as it looked to put its summer woes behind it.\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019s heart trouble, however, could complicate his argument that he is the best positioned to defeat President Trump in the general election. On Wednesday, his campaign said he was postponing a highly-touted $1.3 million television ad buy in Iowa.", "description": "The Vermont senator\u2019s wife said he is in good spirits and should be able to return home by the end of this coming weekend.", "authors": ["Sydney Ember"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/us/politics/03sanders-health/03sanders-health-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
