As it doubled down on Brexit lunacy, actual news robbed it of a vote-winning triumph", "language": "en", "text": "All polling ever done on the subject indicates that the vast majority of the public have no idea what the Labour Party\u2019s position on Brexit is, and frankly it\u2019s time the people started to take some responsibility for themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s easy, this stuff. All you need is to be free at 10am on a Wednesday morning, and settle yourself down in front of a TV and a laptop or a phone, so you can simultaneously watch two speeches from two of Labour\u2019s most senior politicians, setting out entirely different policies, then choose which one you want to believe.\n\nWell, it would have been easy, if both of them hadn\u2019t been simultaneously interrupted by other, actual news.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFor almost at the very moment Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer took to the stage in Brighton and said that Labour wants a general election on which it will commit to a second referendum in which Labour MPs can choose whichever side they like, and at the very moment deputy leader Tom Watson got on stage in London to say that Labour should have a referendum before an election and it should campaign \u201cunequivocally\u201d to Remain, suddenly neither your TV nor your phone nor your laptop were any use to you.\n\nAnd that\u2019s because, while Labour argued in public about what it would hypothetically do about Brexit in various hypothetical situations, there was some actual news to worry about.\n\nThere, standing outside a courthouse in Edinburgh were the SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry and Tommy Sheppard, who had just taken the government to court, and the court had declared that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament had been \u201cunlawful\u201d.\n\nWallop! What happens now? No one knows. One of the lawyers who brought the case reckons that parliament is no longer prorogued, the government reckons it will appeal the decision in the supreme court next week.\n\nWhat, frankly, are the Scottish Nationalists playing at? This is not how you take on a minority government that is lying at will and, quite possibly, breaking the law. If you want to get Boris Johnson on the back foot, the way to do it was made clear on Monday night, when Labour MPs wrote \u201cSILENCED\u201d on bits of paper and waved them about in the House of Commons.\n\nWhy take the government to court when you can fire out \u201cOccupy parliament\u201d memes on your social media channels?\n\nIn the meantime, No 10 has rushed out a statement saying it is \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the ruling.\n\n\u201cThe UK government needs to bring forward a strong domestic legislative agenda. Proroguing parliament is the legal and necessary way of delivering this,\u201d it said.\n\nWhich is unfortunate, because two days ago it had given up on this completely, making clear in written statements that prorogation is \u201cessential if the UK is to leave the European Union by October 31st.\u201d\n\nAnd now it has had to go back to it.\n\nWhich is all very well, but really, it\u2019s the public that suffers. There they all were, desperate to find out what Labour\u2019s Brexit policy really is, via two simultaneous and entirely contradictory speeches on the matter, and then this happens.\n\nIndeed, there was Starmer, live on stage, doing his best to tell the public his version of what Labour\u2019s Brexit policy is.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.
