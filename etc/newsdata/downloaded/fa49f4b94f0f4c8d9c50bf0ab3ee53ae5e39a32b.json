Realmuto is trying to prove he's the best catcher in MLB", "language": "en", "text": "NEW YORK -- Phillies manager Gabe Kapler describes any attempts to tell catcher J.T. Realmuto that he won\u2019t be in the lineup as a \u201cfistfight.\u201d\n\nRealmuto loathes off days. He wants to be back behind the plate every day. Once or twice this year, he\u2019s even won an argument with Kapler, forcing his way into the lineup.\n\n\u201cI want to play, I enjoy playing,\u201d Realmuto said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for your teammates to see you back there every day and not taking days off all the time.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat drive to play every day has Realmuto, 28, set to accomplish a career goal by leading all catchers in games played and innings caught.\n\nHe leads all catchers with 125 games behind the plate, and his 1070.1 innings are 89.2 more than closest competitor Yasmani Grandal.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough, Realmuto leads all catchers by throwing out 48 percent of runners, and he\u2019s also slugged a career-best 24 homers.\n\nRealmuto is showcasing to the world why he\u2019s considered the best catcher in the game all while enjoying his first true playoff push after leaving the Marlins.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the best catcher in the game. It\u2019s kind of not close,\u201d Phillies outfielder Jay Bruce said. \u201cThe way he approaches the game is something I really appreciate because this is my 12th year so I\u2019ve seen a lot of people and a lot of different approaches to the game. (His) way is one of the best I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nMay 1, 2019; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Phillies relief pitcher Edubray Ramos (61) and catcher J.T.

Playing night games after day games can be brutal.\n\nThat\u2019s why Realmuto\u2019s season stands out.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s not as common anymore to see catchers playing 145-150 games as they used to, or, in Randy Hundley\u2019s case, playing in 160 games for the Cubs in 1968. Teams are much more active in trying to get their catchers rest these days.\n\nWillson Contreras led MLB with 1109.2 innings last year, but that marked the fewest innings caught by the league-leading catcher in the 2000s. The hardest-worked backstops used to land in the 1200s, and Jason Kendall even caught 1328.1 innings in the 2008 season.\n\nRealmuto said that he\u2019s always drawn inspiration from Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina, who three times has led all catchers in appearances. The Phillies catcher needs four more starts and five games to set new career-highs.\n\n\u201c(Molina) was a guy out there every day playing day games after night games, it didn\u2019t matter, he was playing 130 games if he could, 140 games if he could, and I always looked up to him in that manner,\u201d Realmuto told Yahoo Sports recently at Citi Field. \u201cI definitely taking pride in being able to do that.\u201d\n\nSep 1, 2019; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia Phillies catcher J.T.

Mandatory Credit: John Geliebter-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSeptember games that matter\n\nFor as much as Realmuto would like to play every day, he can only push himself as much as his body \u2014 specifically his lower half \u2014 will allow.\n\nIn past years, Realmuto said he would feel pain in his hips and legs in these final weeks of the season. He would feel sluggish while catching.\n\nThis year, it\u2019s different.\n\nWhen he takes the field, it doesn\u2019t seem like the season\u2019s about to end.\n\n\u201cI feel great,\u201d Realmuto said.\n\nRealmuto doesn\u2019t have any concrete reason for why he\u2019s felt better than in years past, but credited the Phillies\u2019 training staff.\n\nHe receives several massages per week, and noted that all the mobility work the staff has him do has allowed his right shoulder to feel better than ever.\n\nThere\u2019s also a mental side to it all that perhaps negates any aches he may feel.\n\nIn Realmuto\u2019s five seasons in Miami, the Marlins never won more than 79 games, and finished at least eight games out in each wild-card race.\n\nThis is his first true taste of a playoff push.\n\nAnd Realmuto loves it.\n\n\u201cThat we\u2019re playing for a spot in the playoffs makes you forget you\u2019re tired at the end of the year. I\u2019ve caught more than I ever have but this is the best I\u2019ve ever felt in September body-wise,\u201d Realmuto said. \u201cYou get on the field, your body starts going, adrenaline, you forget you're tired. Especially when you\u2019re trying to win, every game is important. That\u2019s helped me stay fresh.\u201d\n\nRealmuto is set to be the first Phillie since Mike Lieberthal in 1999 to lead catchers in games and innings. Lieberthal caught 1191.1 innings in 143 games that year.\n\n\u201c(Realmuto) prepares like nobody else, keeps his body in shape, does the things necessary treatment wise, whatever it might be to make sure he\u2019s ready to go every day,\u201d Phillies first baseman Rhys Hoskins said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where (Kapler) has to fight him to give him a day off, and as a leader of the team and someone who is catching, that\u2019s the kind of guy you want.\u201d\n\nAs Realmuto\u2019s peers talk him up, one opposing NL coach also sang his praises, noting how Realmuto is \u201cvery creative\u201d with how he receives pitches.\n\nRealmuto has thrown out 42 of 87 runners this season, which he credited to his infielders being the best in the league at making tags.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy you can count on every day. When we play them, I feel like he\u2019s going to be in the lineup. Day game, night game, he\u2019s going to be in the lineup,\u201d the NL coach said. \u201cCertainly, he\u2019s someone you have to deal with offensively and defensively. Offensively, a different story. Defensively, I think he\u2019s the best.\u201d\n\nJul 20, 2019; Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Philadelphia Phillies catcher J.T.

Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\u2018I want to lead the league in everything.\u2019\n\nRealmuto\u2019s standout season could land him a massive payday as soon as this offseason, but he said that\u2019s not on his mind right now.\n\nHe dreams of suiting up in October for the first time and chasing a ring with the Phillies \u2014 who are two back in the wild card race entering Thursday.\n\nOnly 17 games remain in their season, and you better believe that Realmuto wants to be in the lineup for all of them.\n\nAnd if Realmuto does so \u2014 perhaps by winning a fistfight or two \u2014he\u2019ll enter the 2020 season as the defending ironman among catchers.\n\n\u201cI want to lead the league in everything,\u201d Realmuto said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. But I take pride in all aspects. The biggest pride factor I have in baseball is I want to be a complete catcher. I don\u2019t want to be just good at hitting or good at catching or just good at throwing or not good at blocking. This year, I worked really hard on my receiving because that was the weakest part of my catching game.\n\n\u201cWhatever I\u2019m not as good at, I\u2019m going to work to better at because I want to be a complete player.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "J.T.
