Don\u2019t. Want. To. Do. This.\u2019 And then the next thing I know, I was eating it and \u2026 \u201d Here, McCarthy, a Saturday Night Live regular and veteran of several blockbuster comedies, pauses before the punchline lands: \u201c \u2026 it was awful!\u201d\n\nHaddish shakes her head sadly: \u201cI tried to share with y\u2019all poor people food, but you \u2026 it\u2019s all good.\n\n\u201cI was poor! We didn\u2019t eat that!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t grow up in the hood, though.\u201d\n\nMercifully, perhaps, neither this culinary experiment nor any others are featured in The Kitchen. Instead, the title of their new film is taken from the DC comic-book series on which it\u2019s based. It refers both to Hell\u2019s Kitchen, the traditionally Irish neighbourhood of Manhattan where their characters run a protection racket after their gangster husbands are sent to prison, and also to the 1970s domestic servitude that all the men seem to wish they would scuttle back to. No chance, pal.\n\n\u201cI think that this specific story was my story to tell,\u201d said director Andrea Berloff firmly when we spoke earlier that day. Berloff has been working steadily as a screenwriter since 2006\u2019s World Trade Center, picking up an Oscar nomination for the 2015 NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton, and was originally hired to adapt The Kitchen for the screen. This time, though, she put herself forward to direct as well.\n\nNow Berloff says she is determined to direct her next script, too, but will she get the chance? A few days after we meet, The Kitchen goes on general release in the US and \u2013 fairly predictably, for anyone familiar with the ways of Hollywood \u2013 it is poorly reviewed. Subsequently, industry paper Variety publishes a piece analysing the film\u2019s disappointing box office, in which a Warner Bros exec is quoted saying: \u201cIn the case of this story, we took bold choices that didn\u2019t pan out for us.\u201d It is hard not to read this as a signal that it\u2019s back to male-dominated business as usual.\n\nMoss, 37, Haddish, 39, and McCarthy, 49, are three actors all at the peak of their powers, and all very different. Moss is a sunny-natured, self-described \u201cValley girl\u201d who\u2019s been in the biz since childhood and has the Scientology levels to prove it. Fame is much fresher for Haddish, who spent much of her childhood on the other side of LA, in South Central foster homes, before parlaying a social worker\u2019s suggestion into a superstar standup career. She\u2019s now busily shooting \u201cabout 19\u201d movies back to back, like someone who well understands how short-lived the good times can be. McCarthy is a little older, a little calmer; an Illinois farm girl-turned-savvy film-maker who co-produces many of her own blockbuster comedies with her husband of 14 years, Ben Falcone, and regularly appears in Top 10 lists of Hollywood\u2019s best-paid actresses. Last year, she added a best actress Oscar nomination to her achievements.\n\nWhat the three share is a popular appeal that is rooted in talent and not weighted towards looks. That would be an impressive feat for any screen actor, but it is particularly so for women in Hollywood. As McCarthy\u2019s character Kathy tells her children in one memorable scene from The Kitchen: \u201cPretty doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019s just a tool women can use.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love that line,\u201d says McCarthy now, although she is not sure she entirely agrees with it. \u201cI don\u2019t apply that to my life. Not meaning I am or I am not [pretty], it\u2019s just like, I hope my words mean more than my hairdo.\u201d\n\nThis take-it-or-leave-it attitude to the male gaze seems to make them all particularly beloved by female audiences. McCarthy and Haddish began their current winning streaks with Bridesmaids (2011) and Girls Trip (2017), respectively, two female-fronted comedies that were said to usher in a new era by proving the box-office bankability of women. Moss\u2019s feminist credentials, meanwhile, rest on her lead role in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and, before that, playing career gal Peggy Olson in Mad Men. Despite that, a high proportion of those were created and directed by men.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant,\u201d says Haddish. \u201cYou just want somebody good,\u201d says McCarthy. \u201c[Andrea] always made us feel, I think, that it was our film that we were doing,\u201d says Moss. \u201cShe was with us and we were with her, and we were making it together; we were the four kind of constants. That\u2019s very rare in any director \u2013 man or woman \u2013 so that was, I think, a quality that I really valued.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of collaboration, do they reckon they\u2019ve got what it takes to run a protection racket? Haddish answers without hesitation: \u201cHell, yeah!\u201d And you believe her too; no one could survive the ordeals outlined in her 2017 memoir, The Last Black Unicorn, without learning how to take control of a situation. Moss mulls it over more earnestly: \u201cAh \u2026 noooo. Probably not. I think I\u2019d \u2026 nah \u2026 Well? Definitely not with the killing.\u201d While McCarthy offers up the most \u201cmidwestern mom\u201d take imaginable: \u201cLike I\u2019ve said before with my kids, I think embarrassment goes a long way. I don\u2019t want to kill anybody but if it\u2019s like, you show up and just embarrass the bejesus out of someone? I tell you what, they\u2019re only gonna have that happen a coupla times \u2026 \u201d\n\nThe Kitchen makes space for such differing perspectives. In the DC original, all three women are white Irish-Americans, but that didn\u2019t feel right to Berloff. The film also engages with what it might have been like for Haddish\u2019s character to be a black woman living within a white community in the 70s, in a way that becomes intrinsic to the plot. That\u2019s to Berloff\u2019s credit, says Haddish: \u201cI was like: \u2018Maybe, let\u2019s just play it, let\u2019s not even acknowledge [race].\u2019 And Andrea was like: \u2018Oh no, we\u2019re gonna acknowledge it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere are also some great male character actors involved, including Domhnall Gleeson, Common and Bill Camp, and Berloff insists that it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely\u201d a story made for men, too. \u201cWell, listen, I genuinely believe that women have been going to see male-driven movies for a hundred years and that there\u2019s no reason men can\u2019t sit in a theatre and watch amazing actresses do their work.\u201d\n\nThere is no reason, of course, and yet those same hundred years have socialised women to empathise with men\u2019s stories, while male audiences have very rarely been required to make an equivalent imaginative leap. The evidence is at the box office, where poor reviews don\u2019t always dent a male-fronted film\u2019s opening weekend. Wasn\u2019t Bridesmaids supposed to have changed all this? \u201cI just wasn\u2019t that shocked by it,\u201d says McCarthy, in reference to that film\u2019s commercial success. \u201cI do think there are a lot of people that are verbally \u2013 and, I think, in their hearts \u2013 supporting this equality movement, but you\u2019ve got to put your money where your mouth is. You have to show up and make it count at the box office or it will go away. And that\u2019s a very, very scary thing. Not just because we\u2019re in the business, but to say you\u2019re going to stop representing women, 50% of the population, because they\u2019re not worth telling stories about? That hurts my heart as a mother of two girls.\u201d\n\nLike the proverbial Kool-Aid-coated pickle, then, The Kitchen clearly is not going to be to everyone\u2019s taste, but that\u2019s exactly why it\u2019s important to give it a try when offered. What does it say about us if we\u2019re not even willing to do that?\n\nThe Kitchen is in cinemas from Friday 20 September", "description": "Tiffany Haddish, Melissa McCarthy and Elisabeth Moss talk all-female casts, box-office hopes and Kool-Aid pickles", "authors": ["Ellen E Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac8b86bc55db565273752053b8497ed714fc05e8/518_146_2393_1435/master/2393.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d1e819205a87d5f99dc7bd40f6eb9883", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
