Instead, he dug in. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard such humbug in all my life,\u201d he said after a Labour lawmaker, Paula Sherriff, spoke of getting death threats from people who quoted words Mr. Johnson had used to describe his opponents: \u2018\u2018surrender act,\u2019\u2019 \u201cbetrayal\u201d and \u2018\u2018traitor.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut what elicited the greatest outrage \u2014 and no small measure of disbelief \u2014 was Mr. Johnson\u2019s response to a plea for moderation from Tracy Babin, the Labour lawmaker who was elected to the seat formerly occupied by Ms. Cox, who was stabbed and shot by a man shouting \u201cBritain first\u201d and \u201cdeath to traitors.\u201d\n\nFar from calming things down, Mr. Johnson repeated his harsh words, accusing lawmakers of an act of \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201ccapitulation\u201d for trying to stop him from pulling Britain out of the European Union without a deal governing future relations.", "description": "Speaking in Parliament, the prime minister suggested that recalcitrant lawmakers had only themselves to blame for the climate of hostility that has enveloped British politics.", "authors": ["Benjamin Mueller"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/world/26johnson/26johnson-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
