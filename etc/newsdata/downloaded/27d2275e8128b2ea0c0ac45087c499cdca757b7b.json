He then visited a tavern, before spending the night at Kams Lodge in Phoenix with a female companion.\n\nNaidu focused on Pillay's claim that he had spent an entire night with the woman, saying that he was actually just \"hiding out\".\n\n\"I will put to you that you were not there with anyone. You were hiding from police who eventually found you there.\"\n\nNaidu also said that Pillay's initial statement, which claimed he was at an illegal gambling spot for a few hours in the evening, contained discrepancies.\n\nDiscussing the claim that he spent a few hours with several individuals gambling at the Plaza Park, Naidu said that, even though he claimed to have been in the company of many people, no one had confirmed this.\n\n\"You were charged for three murders, which is very serious. Did you not think to find these people to help exonerate you?\"\n\n'It was a fishing knife'\n\nPushing on, Naidu said: \"The reason you never told your lawyers to find these people, and the reason they have never appeared, is because they do not exist. You were never gambling.\"\n\nPillay was also flustered when speaking about video footage that shows him throwing a knife into a bush, just a short distance from the murder scene.\n\n\n\nNervously, Pillay claimed to have found the knife on the road.\n\n\"When I came on the main road, I saw a knife on the road. It was someone's fishing knife. I think it fell off someone's motor vehicle as they were going past. As I picked the knife up, it was messed with bait. It was smelling of fish, so I threw it away.\"\n\nJane Govindsamy, 44, and her daughter Rackelle, 16, were found dead by her husband at about 07:30 on September 21, 2018.\n\nThe body of their elder daughter, 22-year-old Denisha, was later found in a cupboard. It emerged in court that Pillay and Jane had been involved in an extramarital affair for nine years.\n\nProceedings continued.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
