We\u2019ve had a good run of games, including our pre-season, and I think we\u2019re in exactly the right spot.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe way that we train is with a huge amount of intensity, so I don't believe it will be a factor. And we haven\u2019t had to show a huge amount yet \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nGrayson\u2019s concern is that having played against 14 men for the last hour against Argentina and then lost the France game to Typhoon Hagibis, England face a \u201cgiant leap\u201d in intensity against the Wallabies.\n\n\u201cThe intensity in World Cup knockout games goes through the roof,\u201d he reasons. \u201cAnd in this England squad only four players have ever experienced it.\u201d\n\nYoungs is one of those but feels the experience gained, in particular, by the players of Saracens, equips them for the \u2018Ashes\u2019 battle to come.\n\n\u201cThose Sarries boys have played some huge fixtures in Europe and are used to big games,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of work on an off the field to make sure we won\u2019t tighten up.\n\n\u201cI think those guys, in the positions that they play, will allow the team to feel relaxed and go out there to play how we play and not feel that tight about it - or let the occasion get to us.\u201d\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nYoungs refers to Owen Farrell, Jamie George, Maro Itoje, George Kruis and the Vunipola brothers - though Billy Vunipola remains a doubt due to an ankle injury.\n\nEngland have not played a \u2018sudden death\u2019 match for eight years, since they were bundled out of the 2011 World Cup quarter-finals by an unfancied France team.\n\n\u201cThey were deemed to be in turmoil,\u201d Youngs recalled. \u201cIt was a lesson that you can't read anything into what has happened in the past. It is all about that 80 minutes.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cDon't believe your own hype as a side. Just take every day as it comes. It\u2019s not about what happened when you played each other before. It is just about there and then.\u201d\n\nGiven that England have beaten Australia in all six matches since Jones took charge, that is valuable advice. They again go into the last-eight as heavy favourites.\n\n\u2018We have to just make sure that we keep level-headed about it and don\u2019t rely on what has happened before, thinking that will be enough,\" Youngs added. \"Because it won\u2019t be.\"", "description": "Scrum-half responds to Mirror columnist Paul Grayson's fear that England are worryingly short of game time heading into World Cup quarter-final against Australia", "authors": ["Alex Spink", "Image", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20376990.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-Media-Access.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
