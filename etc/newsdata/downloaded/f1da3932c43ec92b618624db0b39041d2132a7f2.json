It faced media reports about a cutthroat work culture and questions from Britain's financial watchdog earlier this year about its sanctions-checking systems.\n\nRevolut said at the time it has never failed to meet its legal or regulatory sanctions requirements.\n\nReuters reported in September that customers who had been victims of fraud were frustrated by the digital bank's customer service, which was slow to respond and offered only in-App chat rather than a telephone helpline.\n\n\"We are a different company than we were two to three years ago, we've learned lessons,\" Storonsky said of those problems.", "description": "British-based digital banking app Revolut is hiring as it expands into 24 new markets thanks to a new global deal with payments giant Visa.", "authors": ["Lawrence White"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d91b49e2e22af18d558acc3-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
