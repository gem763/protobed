Officials with both groups have Twitter accounts with tens of thousands of followers.\n\nAt a press conference on Tuesday, Rose, Reed and Gottheimer said they\u2019re pushing the company to take down the Hezbollah and Hamas content by November 1.\n\n\u201cBring your policy in line with U.S. law,\u201d Gottheimer said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re bringing it to the attention of the State Department and the Treasury [Department].\u201d Hamas and Hezbollah are two of the more than 60 groups currently on the State Department\u2019s list of FTOs.\n\nIn the letter, the lawmakers pointed to Google and Facebook\u2019s responses as a level of commitment larger than that of Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhile other social media companies, including Facebook and Google, have taken proactive measures to address the presence of FTO and affiliated accounts and content on their platforms, Twitter is refusing to take adequate action to stop the spread of terror,\u201d the four lawmakers wrote.\n\nSocial media platforms like Twitter are largely allowed to craft their own policies around how to handle groups designated as \"terrorist\" by the U.S. government.\n\nIn a letter responding to the congressional inquiry last month, Twitter\u2019s director of public policy Carlos Monje, Jr. explained that Twitter makes \u201cexceptions\u201d to its policies on terrorist and extremist content for groups that are involved in \u201cpeaceful\u201d resolution processes or that \u201chave been elected to public office, as is the case with parts of Hamas and Hezbollah,\u201d according to a letter made public on Tuesday.\n\nThe Hamas administration was elected to serve as the governing body of the Gaza Strip over a decade ago, and Hezbollah has been a legitimate part of the government in Lebanon since 2005. Though the U.S. and other Western countries have designated both Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations, both groups have political arms that are responsible for representing large swaths of people and providing social services in Palestinian territory and Lebanon respectively. Hamas has been involved in continual negotiations with the Israeli government and the Palestinian Liberation Organization for years.\n\nAccording to Monje, Twitter allows the groups\u2019 political arms to maintain accounts, though it does not allow accounts affiliated with their military wings.\n\nWhile Twitter and most of the other top social media companies in the world are headquartered in the U.S., they all have presences worldwide and must navigate the complex web of foreign relations and differing definitions of \u201cterrorism\u201d across a variety of conflict-torn nations.\n\nThe push against Twitter comes amid a larger political backlash against companies over how they handle extremist and terrorist content, an issue that gained new attention in light of a string of mass shootings this year by mass shooters with radical online footprints.\n\n\u201cSocial media companies need to be doing ... everything they can to stop this constant threat of violent extremism, disinformation, terror and hate online that\u2019s attacking our democracy,\u201d Gottheimer said at the press conference.", "description": "A team of bipartisan lawmakers are digging into Twitter over its policy of allowing Hamas and Hezbollah to maintain presences on the powerful social media platform.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gottheimerjosh_092719gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
