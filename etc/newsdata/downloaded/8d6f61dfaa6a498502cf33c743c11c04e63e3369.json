Schwartz, now a Super Bowl champion defensive coordinator for the Eagles, will see all his guys when the Lions (1-0-1) visit Philadelphia (1-1) on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, I don\u2019t recognize anybody on that team,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cStafford, the long snapper, the punter and then I think Darius Slay might be the only guys that were there. That shows you how much turnover there is in this league because it really doesn\u2019t seem that long ago. Maybe it has been.\u201d\n\nSchwartz was a first-year head coach when Detroit drafted Stafford No. 1 overall in 2009. He was fired after going 7-9 in 2013, two years after helping the Lions reach the playoffs for the first time in 11 years. He was 29-51 over five seasons.\n\n\u201cHe was part of that process, so I appreciate him a lot for giving me the chance,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cWe went to playoffs for the first time in a long time in this franchise\u2019s history and did a lot of good things in kind of getting us to where we are now, which I\u2019m proud of, and I know he is, too.\u201d\n\nSchwartz has faced Stafford twice already. He was the defensive coordinator under Doug Marrone in Buffalo when the Bills beat the Lions in Detroit. Schwartz was carried off the field by Bills players. Stafford led the Lions to a home win over Schwartz and the Eagles in 2016.\n\n\u201cMatt\u2019s always been a guy that is a very accurate passer,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to put a ball in any window. He\u2019s got a strong arm. He can make all the throws. He\u2019s a really good game manager. That\u2019s gone maybe a little bit under the radar with him, and you can see that in the way they are playing. They are playing a little different scheme. They have a defensive head coach. They have an offensive coordinator that came from a run-first, Seattle-type scheme. So they have maybe a little bit different flavor, but he\u2019s still a very dangerous guy. Goes to the right spot with the ball. Makes accurate throws and moves the ball around to a lot of different people.\u201d\n\nSome things to watch for when the Eagles host the Lions:\n\nBANGED-UP BIRDS\n\nThe Eagles will likely be without their two top receivers. Alshon Jeffery has a calf strain and DeSean Jackson has an abdominal injury. Rookie J.J. Arcega-Whiteside and third-year pro Mack Hollins would start in their place with Nelson Agholor in the slot. Agholor had eight catches for 107 yards and one touchdown in a 24-20 loss to Atlanta. He also dropped what would\u2019ve been a go-ahead 60-yard TD catch. Hollins had five catches for 50 yards and Arcega-Whiteside only caught one ball for 4 yards.\n\nLIMPING LIONS\n\nDetroit hopes linebacker Jarrad Davis can play for the first time since injuring his right ankle nearly a month ago in a preseason game. Lions offensive tackle Taylor Decker has been playing through a back ailment, which he said feels good some days and not so good on others.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has had a back (injury), you know how they can be finicky,\u201d Decker said.\n\nBAD MEMORIES\n\nThe last time Lions coach Matt Patricia faced the Eagles was in the Super Bowl on Feb. 4, 2018. The former New England defensive coordinator saw Nick Foles carve his unit for 41 points in a loss to the Eagles.\n\n\u201cI personally try to not look back at that Super Bowl,\u201d Patricia said.\n\nWHERE\u2019S THE RUSH\n\nThe Eagles have only two sacks in two games and already have lost two defensive tackles to injury. Malik Jackson, who started opposite All-Pro Fletcher Cox inside, sustained a season-ending foot injury in Week 1. Tim Jernigan took his place but broke his foot last week. Hassan Ridgeway takes over for Jernigan. While there\u2019s been a lot of shuffling at the tackle spots, edge rushers Brandon Graham, Derek Barnett and Josh Sweat haven\u2019t been able to get to the quarterback, and that\u2019s problematic.\n\nSLOW STARTS\n\nCarson Wentz and Philadelphia\u2019s offense continue to start slow. The team has scored an NFL-low 41 points in the opening quarter since the start of last season.\n\n\u201cI just have to find the magical plays,\u201d coach Doug Pederson said.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Larry Lage in Detroit contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jim Schwartz struggled to remember any of his former players still on the Detroit Lions other than Matthew Stafford.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Maaddi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/eagles_falcons_football_51718_c0-1068-2329-2425_s1770x1032.jpg?5180a2302cc7eec07076bdcc2c9c027eb35c3034", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
