This week, Shell\u2019s alleged role in the killings is finally being examined by a court in The Hague.\n\nThe Guardian reporter Kate Hodal talks to Rachel Humphreys about the original trial, which was widely discredited as a sham, and the alleged collusion between Shell and the Nigerian government. Humphreys also talks to Esther Kiobel, whose husband, Dr Barinem Kiobel, was among the nine executed, and who has been fighting for justice ever since. Channa Samkalden, the lead lawyer on the case, explains the implications it might have for Shell.\n\nAnd: Guardian defence editor Dan Sabbagh on the ramifications of Trump\u2019s shock decision to withdraw from the Turkish-Syrian border.", "description": "In 1995, the Nigerian government executed nine anti-pollution activists.
