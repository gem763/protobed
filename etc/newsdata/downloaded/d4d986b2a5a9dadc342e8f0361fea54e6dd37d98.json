It was a merger of Andy Bichlbaum\u2019s agitprop street theater group \u201cThe Yes Men,\u201d meets Mike Wallace meets Borat.\n\nAfter combining ideas from Tom Wolfe\u2019s \u201cMau Mauing the Flak Catchers,\u201d Saul Alinsky\u2019s Rules for Radicals, and studying Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s work, I was inspired to change the world. This strange brew of inputs ultimately lead me to undercover investigative journalism. Rush Limbaugh would later describe what we do as \u201cgetting them on video tape being who they are. Therefore, no explanation is required.\u201d This new frontier of journalism became my life\u2019s work.\n\nIt started in college with a Gonzo campaign to ban the breakfast cereal Lucky Charms from Rutgers dining halls because it was an \u201caffront\u201d to Irish-Americans everywhere. Later, my gang of merry pranksters headed to Boston to ask citizens if they would \u201cAdopt A Loving Gitmo Detainee.\u201d\n\nNext came a shocking phone call to a Planned Parenthood office. Posing as a donor I suggested, \u201cThe less black kids out there the better.\u201d The Planned Parenthood worker said, \u201cWe\u2019ll accept the money.\u201d\n\nBut what ultimately created the movement that would become Project Veritas was a Facebook message from an inspired young woman I had never met. After a string of messages, she stated almost as an afterthought, \u201cP.S. have you ever done undercover stuff with ACORN housing?\u201d\n\nTo be honest, I didn\u2019t even know what ACORN was.\n\nThere\u2019s an unwritten rule in journalism you are not supposed to investigate organizations that \u201chelp people.\u201d But after reading about ACORN corruption cloaked with good intentions, we decided to investigate how far their willingness to break the law would go.\n\nThe job fell to 20 year-old scantily clad Hannah Giles and I, then 24. She would play the part of the prostitute and I the pimp. Together we would bring down ACORN and expose the corrupt mainstream media.\n\nIt lead John Stewart of the Daily show to declare: \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that two kids from the cast of High School Musical 3 can break this story with a video camera and their grandmother\u2019s chinchilla coat, and you\u2019ve got nothing?! Investigative media \u2013 where the hell were you?\u201d\n\nFor two months, Hannah and I visited nearly a dozen offices around the United States playing the role of a pimp and prostitute, eliciting statements from various ACORN workers about an outlandish situation involving 13 underage El Salvadoran prostitutes.\n\nTime after time, ACORN employees gave Hannah and I advice on how to evade tax law, avoid the police, bury the illicit money it the ground and declare the underage sex workers as \u201cdependents\u201d on our tax returns.\n\nI was so broke we bought our props from a dollar store. I didn\u2019t have a car, so I borrowed my sister\u2019s beat up 2001 Grand Marquis. I took the Chesapeake Bay Bridge route to Washington D.C. simply because the tolls were a few dollars less than the shorter drive on I-95.\n\nAfter Baltimore, we knew we had something . . .\n\nTanja Thompson, Baltimore ACORN Worker: \u201cIndependent artists, you could be that. Your business is a performing artist, so stop staying prostitute.\u201d\n\nWe were shaking with excitement when we watched the footage in my sister\u2019s old car. But we didn\u2019t quite know where to go with the story. Instinctively, I knew the mainstream media would not cover it\u2026but who would?\n\nI didn\u2019t have many connections, but one lead to a man who would change my life, Andrew Breitbart. He had a penchant for publicity and knowledge on how to \u2018hack the media.\u2019\n\nWhen I showed Andrew the clips on my barely functioning ACER laptop , his immediate response was, \u201cThis story will embarrass The New York Times.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistory,\u201d (i.e. Google and Wikipedia) does not do justice to our elaborate video release strategy. We had anticipated the response of the first release, \u201cone rogue employee.\u201d Predictably, the talking heads on television played right into our hands. A CNN pundit stated on September 10th, with no evidence,\u201c[t]his film crew tried to pull this sham at other offices and failed.\u201d What they didn\u2019t know was that there were half a dozen more bombshells to come.\n\nFrom September 10th, 2009 through September 16th, we fought with people that buy ink by the barrel, using a Chinese water torture\u201d video release strategy. At first glance the story seemed to be about corruption in a quasi-government group. But in the end, what the story really exposed was how the mainstream media had abdicated their responsibility to be a free and independent press. They were now in the news suppression business.\n\nWith their tail between their legs, the New York Times did apologize on September 26th in a piece entitled, \u201cTuning In Too late.\u201d The managing editor admitted having been \u201cslow off the mark.\u201d The Times ombudsman criticized one of his own reporters for leaving out important facts. Brooklyn was the third office we visited, where an ACORN employee told us to bury our ill-gotten gains in a tin can in the ground and \u201cput grass over it.\u201d The Times ombudsman chided the reporter, \u201cI think he should have included New York.\u201d\n\nThe day the Brooklyn tape dropped, the Senate voted 83-7 to defund ACORN. The righteous indignation brought by the tapes created a sphere of political consensus unheard of in Washington.\n\nOne Beltway reporter described \u201cThe stunning, total defeat of ACORN\u201d as \u201ctruly an extraordinary series of events.\u201d It was \u201can important moment in the development of alternative media sources, and official Washington responded before most of the establishment press did.\u201d President Obama, signed the bill stripping ACORN of federal funds passed by a Democratically controlled House and Senate. I\u2019m not even sure the Republicans have the will do that either then, or now.\n\nThere was no education or preparation that could have prepared me for the tsunami that followed. I lost 10 pounds on my already gaunt frame in the first week. I barely slept.\n\nIn the ensuing days, government organizations like the IRS and the Census Bureau cut ties with the organization prompting an avalanche of headlines. The cultural significance of the story was memorialized in episodes of South Park, The Jay Leno Show and the Daily Show.\n\nMy fight wasn\u2019t over. There were the 75 phone calls from CNN that came all at once and did not allow me to make an outgoing call. \u201cDon\u2019t pick up the phone,\u201d Andrew implored. He warned they were just trying to personalize the story, attack the messenger and avoid the substance.\n\nA Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter was forced to print a retraction when she suggested that our motivation to expose ACORN was race related. She wrote that we went after ACORN because they help drive voter registration in black communities. The Post had to print a retraction which read: \u201cAlthough ACORN registers people mostly from those groups, the maker of the videos, James E O\u2019Keefe, did not specially mention them.\u201d\n\nAnother retraction from the Post would come 10 years later, when they inaccurately reported the ACORN videos were proven \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nThere would be a blizzard of attacks against our methods and against our editing, trying to impugn our character. The networks that played the ACORN tapes, first Fox, vetted the raw evidence. And if you\u2019re no fan of Fox\u2019s editorial guidelines, how about The New York Times, Their Pulitzer Prize winner, Clark Hoyt, went through all of the raw evidence and issued a devastating response to the critics:\n\nAcorn\u2019s supporters appear to hope that the whole story will fall apart over the issue of what O\u2019Keefe wore: if that was wrong, everything else must be wrong. The record does not support them. If O\u2019Keefe did not dress as a pimp, he clearly presented himself as one: a fellow trying to set up a woman \u2014 sometimes along with under-age girls \u2014 in a house where they would work as prostitutes. In Washington, he said the prostitution was to finance his future in politics. A worker for Acorn Housing, an allied group, warned him to stay away from the brothel lest someone \u201cget wind that you got a house and that your girlfriend is over there running a house of women of the night. You will not have a career.\u201d The videos were heavily edited. The sequence of some conversations was changed. Some workers seemed concerned for Giles, one advising her to get legal help. In two cities, Acorn workers called the police. But the most damning words match the transcripts and the audio, and do not seem out of context. Harshbarger\u2019s report to Acorn found no \u201cpattern of illegal conduct\u201d by its employees. But, he told me: \u201cThey said what they said. There\u2019s no way to make this look good.\u201d\n\nThere was one defeat. In 2013, I settled a lawsuit with one ACORN employee, who filed a claim that I had violated his privacy rights.\n\nProject Veritas would achieve some justice six years later when we overturned a similar privacy law in Massachusetts, where a Federal judge argued \u201csecret recording is a fundamental right.\u201d\n\nThen in 2019, a Federal Judge in North Carolina delivered a historic directed verdict in a defamation case. The judge wrote, \u201cif citizens and the media are handcuffed by a fear of liability, that\u2019s detrimental to political discourse, it is detrimental to society as a whole, and it is detrimental, really, to our fundamental freedom\u2026.If I\u2019ve gotten this wrong, and the Fourth Circuit says that this is not what the law is, I hesitate to think where the First Amendment is going in this country.\u201d\n\nDoing undercover investigative journalism gets you flak when you effectively and devastatingly expose something. When you do investigative reporting, somebody gets hurt. But what must never be forgotten is that the results will ultimately benefit society. In a democracy, the people\u2019s right to know is necessary if they are to make informed decisions. Legendary reporter Jack Anderson once wrote, \u201cI seem to do my best work when everybody hates me.\u201d\n\nThe new sacred cows are media and big tech. The plan, to investigate them. Because sacred cows like every other institution, need to be held accountable. Now is the time to act. 10 years ago, the ACORN story was a couple kids with a video camera and an idea that changed the course of history.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why, at Project Veritas, 10 years later, the best is yet to come.", "description": "", "authors": ["Project Veritas"], "top_image": "https://www.projectveritas.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Untitled-design-42.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
