It is expected to recover to zero in December.\n\nThe service-sector index improved to 19 from 13 in August, led by wholesalers/retailers and transportation/utility firms.\n\nCompared with three months earlier, the service-sector index was down three points in September. The index is seen worsening to 10 in the next three months.\n\nThe BOJ\u2019s last tankan out in July showed big manufacturers\u2019 business confidence fell to a nearly three-year low in the quarter to June.\n\nThe Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.", "description": "Business confidence among Japanese manufacturers has soured to hit the weakest level in 6-1/2 years, the Reuters Tankan poll for September showed, underscoring fears that the U.S.-China trade war is undermining Japan's export-led economy.", "authors": ["Tetsushi Kajimoto", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428855971&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1Y9", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
