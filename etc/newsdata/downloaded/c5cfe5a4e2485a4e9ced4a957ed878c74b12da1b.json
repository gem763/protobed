REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\n\nThe restructuring plan, known as \u2018Project Hercule\u2019 and requested by President Emmanuel Macron, could split EDF Group in two, according to a draft of the proposal presented to unions in June. EDF did not say whether it would involve job cuts.\n\nFour unions covering a majority of France\u2019s energy sector workers - hardliners FNME-CGT and FNEM-FO, and moderates FC-CFDT and CFE-CGC - have called the strike, which could prove the largest and most disruptive to hit the company this year.\n\nUnion officials have urged staff to gather outside the energy ministry in Paris or local administrations. They gave no concrete forecasts of the planned turnout or impact on EDF.\n\nEDF declined to comment on the strike. A spokesman for the company said the planned restructuring would be presented to the government at the end of the year as requested.\n\n\u201cWe expect reduced power output at the nuclear, hydro, gas and even coal power plants,\u201d Sebastien Menesplier, secretary-general of the energy and mines branch of CGT, told journalists in Paris.\n\nHe said CGT will call for another strike on Sept. 24 and will discuss this with the other unions. \u201cWe hope to stop the calendar and push back EDF management and the government on this project,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder the terms of the plan, EDF would be divided into \u2018EDF Blue\u2019, which would hold its nuclear power generation, hydro power and transmission businesses, and \u2018EDF Green\u2019, which would house its commercial and distribution activities, including grid operator Enedis.\n\nThe state would maintain its 83% holding of EDF Blue. EDF Blue would in turn keep 65% of EDF Green, while 35% would be sold to private shareholders.\n\n\u201cThe restructuring will not resolve EDF\u2019s issues. Workers and customers will pay the price,\u201d said CGT union representative Philippe Page Le Merour. \u201cThis will only allow the financial world to play Monopoly with the company.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is urgency to give EDF the means to invest and provide electricity to all at an affordable prices,\u201d Le Merour said, adding that the proposed plan would instead weaken the company and increase power prices.\n\n\u201cWe hope to stop the project. For us we are looking beyond EDF, we are also calling workers in the gas sector also who are threatened by this deregulation that the government is pushing in various sectors,\u201d Menesplier said.", "description": "EDF unions have called a strike for Sept. 19 to protest plans to restructure the heavily indebted state-controlled utility, a walkout they say could cut power generation.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430825346&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0VW", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
