It\u2019s similar to Netflix\u2019s monthly videos on YouTube that tell subscribers what\u2019s being added to the service \u2014 just longer. Much longer. About three hours and 28 minutes longer, to be precise. It\u2019s necessary, though. Each title is accompanied by a 15-second clip or montage of the movie in question. It\u2019s the best way to get an idea of what a lesser-known Disney movie is.\n\nNot every Disney movie can be Miracle on 34th Street, The Lion King, or Iron Man. Most Disney movies prior to 1989 aren\u2019t household names at all. They include titles like Sammy, the Way-Out Seal, The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin, The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, and The Barefoot Executive. The last movie is about a chimpanzee named Raffles who has the uncanny ability to predict the popularity of TV shows. If ever there was a movie deserving of a remake, Disney, it\u2019s this one.\n\nThe response to Disney\u2019s thread spawned Buzzfeed listicles, and launched a number of memes. String together a few of these titles and it sounds like a bit from The Simpsons.\n\nThe Disney era that most millennials remember didn\u2019t kick off until 1989, when The Little Mermaid helped reestablish Disney Animation. The \u201890s were dominated by Disney Animation and Pixar titles, including The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Toy Story. Even Disney\u2019s more turbulent period in the early \u201800s \u2014 Treasure Planet, Atlantis, Home on the Range, and Brother Bear \u2014 were redeemed by a series of acquisitions under current CEO Bob Iger that morphed Disney\u2019s film slate into the dominant force it is today.\n\nThis video isn\u2019t here to help establish who Lizzie McGuire, Nemo, or Iron Man are; it\u2019s designed to help explain why you should set aside 90 minutes to watch a movie about a chimpanzee who can predict future TV hits. Seriously, The Barefoot Executive demands a reboot.\n\nDisney+ launches on November 12th for $6.99 a month.", "description": "Disney\u2019s massive 600-plus tweet thread announcing which titles would be available to stream on Disney+ in the US come launch day was mostly met with a rousing chorus of, \"that\u2019s not a real movie.\" In an attempt to illuminate each title even more, Disney published a 3.5-hour video on YouTube listing each title that will appear on the service.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UNwCDDyNGwQAeUhyZpyrem-mAUU=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13412121/disneyplus.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
