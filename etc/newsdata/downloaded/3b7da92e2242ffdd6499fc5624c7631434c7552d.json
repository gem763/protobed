These platforms need to wake up and make the safety of their customers the top priority, with a much more rigorous approach to keeping these products out of people\u2019s homes.\n\n\u201cUnsafe products are now flooding online marketplaces. The OPSS must act to ensure these sites are more effectively policed to stem the toxic tide of dodgy goods.\u201d\n\n(Image: ebay)\n\nEbay said customer safety was paramount and it had removed all the listings highlighted by the Which? investigation.\n\nIt said sellers have also been ordered to contact those who bought the alarms to issue refunds.\n\nAliExpress also said customer safety was paramount and it expected sellers to comply with regulations of each nation where it operates.\n\nAnd Wish said it was working on removing the products from its platform.\n\nToday Electrical Safety First warned households to only buy CO and smoke alarms from reputable retailers.\n\nIts technical director Martyn Allen said: \u201cWe continue to call for better regulation of products sold on these sites.\n\n\u201cConsumers should take into account that when purchasing a smoke alarm and any other electric product from an online marketplace they are generally purchasing from a third party seller leaving them vulnerable to being exposed to substandard products.\u201d", "description": "Consumer champion and watchdog Which? has blasted the online auction website for allowing the dangerous devices to continue to be sold", "authors": ["Ruki Sayid", "Image", "Ebay"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743939.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-171137421.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
