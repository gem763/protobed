We proved we\u2019d be out the country, but the judge wasn\u2019t even interested in adjourning it.\n\n\u2018Why? Because I believe they have it in for me. I just want to clarify something. Where I live, there is five houses all around me and we all have the same postcode but we all have a different name on our house.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKatie, 41, added: \u2018So this is what happens to me, some people write to me but I don\u2019t always get it on time. It\u2019s got my name and my postcode \u2013 but the wrong house.\n\n\u2018It happens a lot, parking tickets, court stuff, police stuff, anything, bills. Now when I go to court and say I don\u2019t always get my post the court don\u2019t want to hear that.\n\nKatie claims police pull her over due to her unmistakable pink car (Picture: Instagram)\n\n\u2018Not only that, but I need to drive and I am going to appeal. I live in the middle of nowhere, I have a son with disabilities that might need to be rushed to hospital at certain times.\n\n\u2018My mum is terminally ill and I need to visit my mum. If they\u2019re banning me for two years, how do I know my mum is going to be here in two years\u2019 time? I need to be able to get to my mum.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s obscene that the courts won\u2019t listen just because they banned me before three times, which was also unfair.\u2019\n\nKatie gave her opinion on the driving ban on YouTube, branding it \u2018b*****ks\u2019 (Picture: Katie Price/YouTube)\n\nShe added that she thinks her ban is \u2018b*****ks\u2019 and overly harsh, explaining: \u2018I have builders inside my house, my post gets moved here, there and everywhere, so at the moment I don\u2019t get all my post so I am going to appeal my driving ban.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s obscene, being banned for two years. Two years is a long time and I don\u2019t deserve it at all, it\u2019s a load of b*****ks. Everyone says my pink Range Rover is gone but I still have it, I just don\u2019t drive it.\n\n\u2018Well, I can\u2019t now because people like the police do pull me over and I\u2019m like \u201cwhat have I done\u201d, and their attitude is \u2018\u2019what\u2019s with the attitude\u2019\u2019 and I\u2019m like \u201cwhy have you pulled me over?\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just \u2018cos they want to be nosey, what other person has a pink car in my area? They know it\u2019s me.\u2019\n\nThe mother of five was banned from the road for two years after she failed to attend a court hearing and was charged with withholding the name of the driver of her car after it was involved in a collision last November.\n\nHer lawyers wrote to the court to postpone the hearing on 10 October as she was due to fly back to the UK on that date, but the judge refused to delay it further.\n\nDistrict Judge Robert Hunter told Bexley Magistrates\u2019 Court: \u2018This hearing has already been adjourned once. This date was agreed by both sides. I am not inclined to further adjourn this matter.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs well as being banned from driving with 12 points on her license, Katie was also given a \u00a3440 fine, a \u00a344 surcharge and ordered to pay \u00a3100 in costs.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
