Mueller III\u2019s final report, noting an April decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that struck down judges\u2019 \u201cinherent authority\u201d to release such materials when the public interest outweighs the need for secrecy.\n\nChief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of the District of Columbia said she was bound by the ruling, McKeever v. Barr, and that the petitioning party, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, did not qualify for other exceptions to grand jury secrecy rules.\n\n[House panel asks court to enforce Mueller-related subpoenas, a step toward possible impeachment]\n\nThe ruling does not affect a separate pending lawsuit by the House Judiciary Committee seeking grand jury materials in Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, which was brought under an exception to secrecy rules for requests \u201cpreliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding,\u201d namely impeachment.\n\nIn an eight-page opinion, Howell wrote that the Reporters Committee\u2019s efforts to further journalists\u2019 newsgathering and ensure government transparency \u201chave significant value\u201d but \u201cfall outside the scope of this exception.\u201d\n\nReporters Committee legal director Katie Townsend expressed disappointment in a ruling that keeps cloaked \u201cinformation that the public could not have a stronger interest in seeing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe district court\u2019s decision makes clear that the public has few avenues in this Circuit to seek the release of grand jury material, even in cases where the public\u2019s interest in access to that material is at its height,\u201d Townsend said.\n\nRead more:\n\nAppeals court in D.C. rules judges may not create exceptions to grand-jury secrecy rules\n\nWatergate report released from archives could be a \u2018road map\u2019 for Mueller\n\nHouse panel asks court to enforce Mueller-related subpoenas, a step toward possible impeachment\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The chief district judge in Washington said the D.C.
