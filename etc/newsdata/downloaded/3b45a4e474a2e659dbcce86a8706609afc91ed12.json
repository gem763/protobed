Fire officials determined in May that PG&E equipment caused the Camp Fire last November, which became the most destructive forest fire in the state\u2019s history and killed 85 people. It also burned nearly 14,000 homes and razed more than 150,000 acres of land.\n\nSumeet Singh, vice president of PG&E\u2019s Community Wildlife Safety Program, said during a media conference in San Francisco upwards of 800,000 people throughout portions of 34 northern, central and coastal counties would lose power during the shutoff Wednesday.\n\nSingh added that peak winds are expected to start early Wednesday and continue into Thursday.\n\nSonoma County issued a Red Flag Warning that advised residents PG&E would conduct an \u201cimminent power shutoff.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may lose power starting at midnight tonight,\u201d the statement said. \u201cA prolonged outage may reduce our ability to warn you in the event of an emergency. Remain aware of your surroundings and be prepared to evacuate if you feel in danger.\u201d\n\nSonoma County\u2019s Superintendent told the Los Angeles Times the planned outages are a \u201cblunt\u201d approach, but \u201cthere\u2019s an understanding of why it\u2019s being undertaken.\u201d\n\nPG&E said communities not forecast to receive extreme weather may also have their power cut, as the vast electric system relies on power lines that work together.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our customers and the communities we serve is our most important responsibility, which is why PG&E has decided to turn power off to customers during this widespread, severe wind event,\u201d PG&E Sr. Vice President of Electric Operations Michael Lewis said in a statement. \u201cWe understand the effects this event will have on our customers and appreciate the public\u2019s patience as we do what is necessary to keep our communities safe and reduce the risk of wildfire.\u201d\n\nWhile the company has received much criticism from the public over its third power shut off in the last two months, Gov. Gavin Newsom defended the company and said the shutoff was in the public interest.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we want to protect people,\u201d he said in Oakland Tuesday at a bill signing event. \u201cWe want to make sure people are safe. This is what PG&E thinks is in the best interest of their customers and ultimately for this region and the state.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 9 (UPI) \u2014 Pacific Gas & Electric, California\u2019s largest utility, said Wednesday it will begin to shut off electricity to portions of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
