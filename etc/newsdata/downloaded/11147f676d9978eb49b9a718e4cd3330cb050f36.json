This comes amid the start of two days discussions in Washington between the world\u2019s biggest economies.\n\nHow are the benchmarks performing?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.92% rose 9 points, or less than 0.1% , to 26,355. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.96% was up 2 points, or less than 0.1%, to 2,921. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.98% picked up 14 points, or 0.2%, to 7,918.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Dow rose 181.97 points, or 0.7%, to end at 26,346.01. The S&P 500 index gained 26.34 points to finish at 2,919.40, up 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 79.96 points, or 1%, to close at 7,903.74.\n\nWhat drove the stock market?\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted that he would meet Chinese Vice Premier Liu He to advance a trade deal, bolstering hopes that the U.S. was looking to strike a resolution soon.\n\nLiu He is meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington, with the hope that the parties can resolve, at least partially, tensions over trade that have stoked anxieties on Wall Street, though it is unclear if a substantive agreement can be achieved.\n\nMarkets were whipsawed overnight Thursday by reports from the South China Morning Post suggesting that the China delegation would leave Washington on Thursday, a day earlier than had been planned. However, a White House spokesperson later told CNBC that there were no changes to plans of the Beijing representatives.\n\nBloomberg News reported that the White House may implement a previously agreed upon currency deal with China ahead of schedule, and suspend tariff hikes to 30% from 25% scheduled to take effect Oct. 15 on some $250 billion in China products. Those moves would be part of a first-phase agreement with China, the report said, with negotiations on critical issues such as intellectual-property rights and forced technology transfers coming at a later time.\n\nSeparately, the New York Times reported Wednesday night that President Donald Trump had approved issuing licenses to some U.S. companies to conduct business with Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies. The U.S. blacklisted Huawei earlier this year, and allowing sales of non-sensitive products could help defuse trade tensions.\n\n\u201cThe last round of trade talks ended in July without an agreement. Expectations for a breakthrough this time are low, but there is good reason to expect that talks will continue,\u201d wrote strategists at UniCredit in a Thursday research note.\n\n\u201cThere appears to be some willingness on both sides to reach a deal,\u201d the strategists said.\n\nIn economic data, U.S. consumer price inflation was little changed in September, giving the Federal Reserve room to cut interest rates in late October. Weekly jobless claims fell in early October.\n\nInvestors also saw some commentary from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan who said he\u2019s open-minded on the outlook for further rate cuts. The central bank has already cut its benchmark interest rate by a half percentage point this year.\n\nWhich stocks are moving?\n\nPG&E\u2019s stock PCG, -30.10% plunged after a judge ruled to allow for a competitive bankruptcy plan, opening up the path for Elliott Management Group and other bondholders to push for their own chapter 11 plan. Their proposal would involve raising new money and using most of PG&E\u2019s equity to pay off the utility firm\u2019s debts.\n\nShares for Ra Pharmaceuticals Inc. RARX, +100.48% surged after Belgian biopharma company UCB agreed to acquire the Mass-based biopharma company for $2.5 billion.\n\nKroger Co.\u2019s stock KR, -2.06% tumbled after a Jefferies analyst called the grocer\u2019s tech investment into Ocado a \u201cmisstep,\u201d downgrading the company to hold from buy.\n\nHow are other assets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +4.07% was up 4.7 basis points to 1.632%, from 1.585% late Wednesday.\n\nGold futures fell after posting small gains on Wednesday. Gold for December delivery GCZ19, -0.98% was down 0.9% at $1,499.00 an ounce after rising 0.6% on Wednesday.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery CLX19, +1.20% rose 68 cents, or 1.3%, at $53.27 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nIn Asia overnight Thursday, trade was mixed, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index HSI, +0.10% added 0.1% to 25,707.93, the China CSI 300 000300, +0.82% rose 0.8% to reach 3,874.64, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 NIK, +0.45% gained 0.5% to 21,551.98. The Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.62%, meanwhile, edged 0.1% lower to 380.00.", "description": "Stocks climb in early Thursday trading after President Donald Trump says he would meet China\u2019s chief trade negotiator at the White House on Friday.", "authors": ["Mark Decambre", "Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS875_uschin_ZG_20191008121602.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
