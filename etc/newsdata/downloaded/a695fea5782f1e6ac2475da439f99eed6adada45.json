Two dozen more were wounded in the rampage outside Odessa, Texas \u2014 the second mass shooting in the state in a month. The alleged gunman was killed by police, bringing the total death toll from the incident to eight. The deceased ranged in age from 15 to 57.\n\nThe terrifying chain of events began with a traffic stop Saturday on an interstate in the heart of Texas' oil country. State troopers say the man, a white male, pulled over for the traffic stop but then opened fire and took off.\n\nGunshots hit one trooper in the car that made the traffic stop. The gunman then ditched his car and hijacked a postal service truck, unleashing more rounds as he drove away. Authorities later said the postal worker, 29-year-old Mary Granados, was killed.\n\nHer teary-eyed identical twin sister, Rosie, told CBS News correspondent David Begnaud, \"He could have taken the car without having to kill her. ... He didn't have to take my sister.\"\n\nThe gunman was eventually killed in a shootout with police outside a movie theater, but two more officers were among those left wounded. All three officers shot were said to be in stable condition as of Saturday night.\n\nThe suspect died in a hospital in Midland and has been identified as Seth Ator, 36, according to his criminal record obtained by CBS News.\n\nSeth Ator, 36-year-old suspected gunman in August 31, 2019 mass shooting in Odessa and Midland, Texas CBS News\n\nAt least 10 victims remained in critical condition at two local hospitals.\n\nOdessa police said in a statement that the suspect fired \"at innocent civilians all over\" the city. The youngest victim confirmed as of Sunday was a 17-month-old girl who was struck by shrapnel.\n\nOfficials said during a news conference Sunday afternoon that they did not believe there was any connection to foreign or domestic terrorism in the shooting. They said it appeared he acted alone but they were trying to determine his motive.\n\nPolice confirmed Sunday that the Texas shooter used an AR-15 \"type weapon,\" but they did not give any information on how it was obtained.\n\nA law enforcement source told CBS News he was pulled over by police because he apparently had been driving erratically. A number of calls came into the Texas Department of public safety from people reporting his erratic driving, leading to the dispatch of officers.\n\n\"This was a joint effort by a multitude of departments to find this animal and to bring him to justice,\" Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke said. He refused to utter the gunman's name.\n\nBegnaud noted that the shooting came just a month after a gunman in El Paso killed 22 people when he opened fire in a Walmart store.

He repeated that mental health was in his view a \"big problem\" driving the country's spate of mass shootings.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott told reporters Sunday that \"I have been to too many of these events\" and added \"Too many Texans are in mourning. Too many Texans have lost their lives. The status quo in Texas is unacceptable, and action is needed.\"", "description": "Alleged gunman killed in shootout with police, three of whom were also injured, after traffic stop led to a chaotic car chase near Odessa", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/01/f315ca9b-7958-4ae5-9ee8-2645d6c40048/thumbnail/1200x630/d3c61ef7db9d60189cb30a8545697810/odessa-texas-shooting1165309394.jpg"}
