Federal law bans sales to those under 18. The FDA has been investigating Juul for months but had not previously taken action against the company.\n\nA Juul spokesman said the company is reviewing the FDA comments and \u201cwill fully cooperate.\u201d\n\nIn a sternly worded warning letter, the FDA flagged various claims made by Juul representatives, including that its products are \u201cmuch safer than cigarettes.\u201d Currently no vaping product has been federally reviewed to be less harmful than traditional tobacco products, and that won\u2019t happen for a while.\n\nIn the past year, Juul has tried to position its e-cigarettes as a tool to help adult smokers stop smoking, using the tagline \u201cMake the Switch.\u201d In a separate letter to the company, the FDA said it is \u201cconcerned\u201d that its campaign suggests \u201cthat using Juul products poses less risk or is less harmful than cigarettes.\n\n\u201cJUUL has ignored the law, and very concerningly, has made some of these statements in school to our nation\u2019s youth,\u201d said FDA acting commissioner Ned Sharpless, in a statement.\n\nThe agency\u2019s warning letter highlights an incident recounted by two New York high school students during a congressional hearing in July. The students said a representative of Juul was invited to address the school as part of an assembly on mental health and addiction issues. During the presentation, the students said the representative told them the company\u2019s product was \u201ctotally safe.\u201d The representative also showed students a Juul device and claimed the FDA \u201cwas about to come out and it was 99 percent safer than cigarettes.\u201d\n\nJuul says it discontinued its school programs - which were intended to discourage underage use - last September.\n\nFDA warning letters are not legally binding, but regulators can take companies to court if they don\u2019t comply with the government\u2019s requests.\n\nE-cigarettes have been on the U.S. market for more than a decade, but the FDA didn\u2019t gain the authority to regulate them until 2016. E-cigarette makers have until next May to submit their products to the FDA for health reviews.\n\nMost experts, though, agree the aerosol from e-cigarettes is less harmful than cigarette smoke since it doesn\u2019t contain most of the cancer-causing byproducts of burning tobacco. But there is virtually no research on the long-term effects of vaping. E-cigarettes generally heat liquid containing nicotine.\n\nIn a letter to Juul CEO Kevin Burns, FDA regulators said they were \u201ctroubled\u201d by a number of other points raised at the congressional hearing. The letter cites congressional testimony that Juul\u2019s advertising \u201csaturated social media channels frequented by underage teens,\u201d and \u201cused influencers and discount coupons to attract new customers.\u201d\n\nLast year, Juul closed down its social media sites. And under pressure, it voluntarily removed its fruit and dessert flavors from retail stores.\n\n___\n\nAP Writer Richard Lardner contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
