It\u2019s a good performance but we\u2019ve got to play better next week.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mind-set, it\u2019s the attitude of the players, the messaging the staff gives the players and the messaging the leadership gives the players. It\u2019s about making sure no one gets too far ahead of themselves and this team has got no reason to, because we haven\u2019t achieved what we want to achieve. All it\u2019s done is give us another week in the competition.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be normal because you have this (gestures to all media) and you\u2019ll have people on the street patting you on the back and telling you how you\u2019re good you\u2019ve been. I\u2019m sure the newspapers will be full of praise so you\u2019ve got to work hard to keep yourself focused.\u201d\n\nEngland are almost certain to go into the final as favourites following their victory over the three-time world champions, with bookmakers already giving them a strong chance of reclaiming the Webb Ellis Cup for the first time in 16 years.\n\nBut South Africa are riding a wave of rejuvenation following the arrival of Rassie Erasmus last year, which preceded a series victory over England in the summer of 2018 that will help to fuel the Springboks squad this week in the most important of weeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve beaten them before, they\u2019ve beaten us before,\u201d said South Africa lock Lood de Jager. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tight. We have a foot in the door and that\u2019s the most important thing. These are the biggest games of your life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very physical. The only way we know is fighting fire with fire. We base our game on physicality and they\u2019re a very physical side at the moment. Its going to be the team that dominates the gain line that wins the game.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa\u2019s a tough place to grow up. You need to bring that out. We don\u2019t psyche each other up and bang our heads against the wall. It\u2019s tough growing up in South Africa and you have to bring that out when you\u2019re on the pitch. There\u2019s a lot of stuff. It\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s a lovely country and I love it but it\u2019s a tough place to grow up. Our captain grew up in a township. Go there and see for yourself. A lot of people grew up in tough places and rural places and they need to bring that out.\u201d\n\nEngland will enjoy a second day off on Monday before returning to training and building up to the biggest game in the country\u2019s rugby history in 16 years, though they already have a slight advantage with an extra day to prepare when compared to South Africa.\n\nBut despite the obvious success that they enjoyed at the weekend, Jones could yet make changes to his side. The Australian has already called Saracens scrum-half Ben Spencer up to replace the injured Willi Heinz, who has dropped out of the 31-man squad with a hamstring injury but will remain with the squad for the rest of the week, while England are monitoring how Owen Farrell, Jonny May, Anthony Watson and Kyle Sinckler recover from knocks. Yet Jones could look to make further changes regardless of how Saturday\u2019s starting XV come through the start of the week, with the prospect of dropping George Ford back to the bench a genuine possibility given the physical pressure that South Africa will bring particularly through centre Damian de Allende, even though Farrell made 15 tackles \u2013 the second most of any England player \u2013 with Ford chipping in with 13.\n\n\u201cThey defended well but next week is another situation,\u201d Jones added. \u201cWe\u2019ll look at how we need to play and what the opposition are going to bring to the party and then we\u2019ll decide on selection.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones brought his England\u00a0squad crashing back to earth in the wake of their historic victory over New Zealand\u00a0by stressing they haven\u2019t achieved anything yet.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/27/15/eddie-jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
