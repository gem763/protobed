When Lincoln served his one term in the House of Representatives from 1847 to 1849, he lived in a boardinghouse facing the Capitol on the current site of the Library of Congress. It was known as \u201cAbolition House\u201d for being a center of antislavery activists in Washington. (Among Lincoln\u2019s mess mates were Rep. Joshua Giddings of Ohio, the leading abolitionist in the House, who helped Lincoln write a bill for emancipation in the District of Columbia, along with a variety of Whig members and federal employees.)\n\nEdmund F. French, a clerk at the Treasury Department, daily dined and lived in the house with Lincoln. In 1859, while still working at Treasury, he wrote the \u201cConstitution and bylaws of the National Baseball Club of Washington, D.C.\u201d It was the founding document of the Washington Nationals; French was the club\u2019s James Madison. The Nationals\u2019 constitution laid down the rules for sportsmanlike conduct as well as the charge for monthly dues.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFrench was also a player on the team composed of other government clerks who suited up in uniform in the late afternoons. In 1862, he became the Nationals\u2019 first president. And President Lincoln invited President French to various White House social occasions. (His brother Benjamin Brown French, appointed the superintendent of public buildings by Lincoln, planned Lincoln\u2019s inaugurations and later his trip to dedicate the cemetery at Gettysburg.)\n\nLincoln loved baseball. He had played a primitive and popular version called \u201ctownball\u201d as a young man and lawyer in Illinois. There are several accounts of him playing in Springfield and in towns throughout the Eighth Judicial Circuit of Illinois that he traveled as a lawyer during the 1850s. \u201cHere Abraham Lincoln and his friends played townball,\u201d reads a marker placed before the Postville Park, Ill., courthouse by the Illinois Historical Society.\n\nDuring the 1860 presidential campaign, a widely circulated political cartoon depicted Lincoln as a baseball player triumphing over his opponents. \u201cYou must have a good bat and strike a fair ball to make a clean score and homerun,\u201d the Lincoln figure says. On the long bat in his hands are inscribed the words \u201cEqual rights and free territory.\u201d\n\nLincoln liked playing townball even as president, especially with boys. He took long rides out to the Maryland home of Francis P. Blair, called Silver Spring, to consult with the venerable political savant \u2014 who had been a member of Andrew Jackson\u2019s Kitchen Cabinet and helped found the Republican Party \u2014 and to cavort in games of townball.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of the Blair grandchildren, Frank B. Blair, recalled how a group of the children eagerly awaited his visit: \u201cWe boys, for hours at a time, played \u2018town ball\u2019 on the vast lawn, and Mr. Lincoln would join ardently in the sport. I remember vividly how he ran with the children; how long were his strides, and how far his coat-tails stuck out behind, and how we tried to hit him with the ball, as he ran the bases. He entered into the spirit of the play as completely as any of us, and we invariably hailed his coming with delight.\u201d\n\nDuring the Civil War, Union soldiers in their camps played the newly regularized game of baseball. In Washington, organized teams like the Nationals played in the White Lot. But less formal teams of federal employees also played. According to one firsthand account by Winfield Scott Larner, a journalist, Lincoln watched a game between the quartermaster\u2019s department and the commissary department near Sixth and K streets NW on an old circus ground.\n\n\u201cThe well-known black carriage drawn by two black horses came along,\u201d stated Larner. \u201cI saw the president get out \u2026 and taking his little son, Tad, by the hand, walk over to see the game.\u201d There were no seats. \u201cMr. Lincoln sat down in the sawdust left by the circus back of first base, crossed his feet, and sat his little son up on them, between his knees.\u201d He stayed to finish. At the game\u2019s end, both teams gave \u201cthree cheers for each other.\u201d Lincoln \u201cjoined in the cheering.\u201d Then the players gave \u201cThree cheers for Old Abe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLincoln was surrounded by men who followed baseball. The journalist to whom he was closest, Noah Brooks, whom he planned to appoint as his private secretary in his second term, went on to write the first novel about baseball, \u201cOur Base Ball Club and How It Won the Championship.\u201d\n\n\u201cBaseball is the hurrah game of the republic!\u201d declared Walt Whitman, who spent many mornings waiting outside the White House to see Lincoln coming and going. Many apocryphal statements have been attributed to Lincoln. And of course, baseball clubs in Washington have come and gone since those first Nats that Lincoln watched.\n\nBut it seems likely that Lincoln, the first president to be a Nationals fan, might once have uttered something like the hurrah: \u201cGo Nationals!\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The long history of baseball in D.C.", "authors": ["Sidney Blumenthal", "Sidney Blumenthal Is The Author Of"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4LkU3hFLVtZoYdI0hZeZl9ZyHyQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y25BK6SROEI6TPNXIT4URTAGAU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
