It took weeks to identify him. A key step came when a label on his underwear led to broadcasting of a photo of the victim in the Netherlands.\n\nAccording to a police account from 1999, another big step came when a son recognized the victim as possibly his father, who he said had flown to Atlanta on Sept. 17, 1999, \u201cbecause he felt like just going to see the United States, and he just picked up and went.\u201d\n\nThe son said his father had traveled with a lot of cash.\n\nPolice said that De Hart had died of blunt-force injury and that evidence indicated he had been killed elsewhere before his body was brought to the creek. Police asked anyone with information to contact their cold-case unit.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The man was found in a creek in Manassas.", "authors": ["Martin Weil", "Local Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
