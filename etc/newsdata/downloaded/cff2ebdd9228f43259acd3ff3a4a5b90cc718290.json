In 1994, for example, the prize was awarded to Israel\u2019s Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin, as well as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.\n\nBut the decision to award the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize only to Ethiopia\u2019s Abiy was hardly surprising. Eritrea\u2019s Isaias leads one of the most repressive military dictatorships in the world; his government has been compared to North Korea and accused of possible crimes against humanity.\n\nAnd even though he reached an agreement with Abiy in Eritrea\u2019s capital last year to end the conflict between the two nations, in practice the agreement remains largely unimplemented, and there have been little visible benefits for Eritreans.\n\n\u201cI think there was a lot of hope in Eritrea,\u201d said Laetitia Bader, a researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cBut very quickly, Eritreans saw that things were not changing on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say it has brought no positive developments for the Eritrean people, because the lived reality is the same more than a year after the peace deal,\u201d said Vanessa Tsehaye, an Eritrean activist based in London.\n\nThe conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia stretches back decades. After European powers left occupied Eritrea in 1951, landlocked Ethiopia claimed the land of its coastal neighbor, eventually resulting in a civil war that started in 1961 and lasted three decades.\n\nIn 1991, Eritrean forces helped overthrow the communist-led government in Ethiopia, and two years later, Eritreans voted for independence.\n\nHowever, the two nations did not reach an agreement on the border between them, and in 1998, small-scale border incidents around the town of Badme grew into a full-fledged conflict. It\u2019s estimated that almost 100,000 people died, and after it ended, Ethiopian troops had control of Badme and other disputed areas.\n\nAs part of a peace agreement brokered in Algiers, in 2000, a commission cited colonial-era documents to rule that the land around Badme was part of Eritrea. But Ethiopia did not agree to the arbitrated border, and the two sides remained in a standoff.\n\nTheir relationship was dubbed \u201cno war, no peace,\u201d which meant that diplomatic, trade and transport ties were severed, and the countries remained on a war footing, clashing repeatedly and supporting rival rebel groups.\n\nAbiy, a former intelligence officer who had taken part in the operations to drive Eritreans out of Badme, took office as Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister in April 2018 and almost immediately began changes in the country, which had long been ruled by authoritarian governments.\n\nOn June 5, 2018, Abiy made a key pledge to accept the peace agreement with Eritrea and withdraw Ethiopian troops from occupied territory. Within weeks, Isaias responded by saying that both nations yearned for peace.\n\nJust a month after Abiy\u2019s announcement on July 8, the Ethiopian leader touched down at the airport in Eritrea\u2019s capital Asmara, where he was greeted by Isaias. The leaders embraced and later announced they would reopen embassies, allow direct communications and restore transport links.\n\n\u201cLove is greater than modern weapons like tanks and missiles,\u201d Abiy said. \u201cLove can win hearts, and we have seen a great deal of it today here in Asmara.\u201d\n\nDespite the signs of goodwill, critics say not much has actually changed between the two nations. Among the Eritrean diaspora, many voiced disapproval for the Nobel Peace Prize focusing on the agreement with Eritrea when so little had changed in practice.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know one could win a peace award without achieving peace!\u201d Selam Kidane, a London-based activist wrote on Twitter.\n\nBorder crossings between Ethiopia and Eritrea were opened last year, but Eritrea soon closed the border again. Analysts suspect that Eritrea, which has virtually complete control over its citizens, is dragging its feet because of fears about wider reform.\n\nIsaias, a former freedom fighter, has led the country since 1993, and his government has left no room for opposition. In 2015, the United Nations released the results of a year-long investigation into human rights in the country, finding \u201csystematic, widespread and gross human rights violations,\u201d including extrajudicial killing, torture and forced labor.\n\nBader said that there was little evidence that there had been any positive change to some of the most restrictive elements, such as the arbitrary arrest of people for perceived political crimes, or the indefinite national service that sees many Eritreans permanently conscripted to the military.\n\n\u201cThe government has often argued that it was the \u2018no war, no peace\u2019 situation with Ethiopia was what forced it to conscript its whole population,\u201d Bader said.\n\nJeffrey Smith, the director of Vanguard Africa, said that he viewed the Nobel Prize as \u201cencouraging Prime Minister Ahmed and the new regime in Ethiopia as much if not more than it is about the progress already made.\u201d\n\nBut for activists such as Tsehaye, the peace deal had helped legitimize Isaias, the leader of an isolated and repressive nation of just 5 million people on the world stage. The Eritrean leader had traveled with Abiy to foreign nations, and the United Nations lifted sanctions on Eritrea.\n\n\u201cPeace is always a good thing, it\u2019s never something that we should be against,\u201d Tsehaye said, \u201cbut we need to understand peace beyond its literal meaning of no war.\u201d", "description": "Activists say Eritrea's government, one of the most restrictive in the world, is as bad as ever.", "authors": ["Adam Taylor", "Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FK-eLyKwTGoRbJvIDtGgro98HrU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ICSLBVXMBQI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
