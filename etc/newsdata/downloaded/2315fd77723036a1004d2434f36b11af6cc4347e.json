You can record and playback a virtually unlimited number of audio and MIDI tracks. The program supports simultaneous recording from multiple 16 and 24 bit soundcards, and real-time audio effects can be applied non-destructively to each track. Built-in effects include Reverb, Multiband Compression, Chorus, Delay, Pitch Shift, Graphic and Parametric EQ & spectrum analyzer. The program can use third party VST plug-ins to process in real-time audio signals. Effect can also be used to process the recorded signal in real-time so that the computer can act as a multi-effects device. MIDI tracks can be imported end exported to regular MIDI files, and edited using the built in piano-roll based MIDI editing window. The program supports VSTi instruments plug-ins for sample accurate software MIDI playback. All the audio tracks are saved as standard wave files and mixed \"on the fly\" during playback. Volume and pan evolution can be programmed by drawing on the timeline window. When all the tracks have been recorded and all the settings are correct you can mix-down the final song to CD or create, using the built-in mp3 encoder, an mp3 version to distribute through the Internet. A native 64 bit version is available which exploits the full power of 64 bit processing (10.6.x Snow Leopard or later required for the 64 bit version).", "description": "n-Track Studio is an audio & MIDI multitrack recorder that turns your computer into a full-fledged recording studio.
