REUTERS/Adriano Machado\n\nBolsonaro, a far-right former army captain, reacted furiously to comments by Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who was tortured under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet and was the first female Chilean president.\n\nBachelet told reporters she was concerned by a jump in killings by Rio de Janeiro police, backtracking on democratic norms and attacks on indigenous communities amid a rise in Amazon forest fires that have been a point of contention between Bolsonaro and leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\u201cBachelet ... (is) following Macron\u2019s line in meddling in domestic affairs and Brazilian sovereignty,\u201d Bolsonaro wrote on Facebook. \u201cShe attacks Brazil with the agenda of the human rights (of criminals), attacking our valiant ... police.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro also personally attacked Bachelet, whose father, an air force general, remained loyal to socialist President Salvador Allende after a 1973 coup in Chile and died in jail.\n\n\u201c(Bachelet) forgets that the only reason (her) country isn\u2019t like Cuba is thanks to those who had the courage to put a stop to the left in 1973,\u201d Bolsonaro wrote. \u201cAmong those communists was her ... father.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s comments irked Chile\u2019s opposition parties and were even criticized by some leaders of President Sebastian Pinera\u2019s centre-right ruling coalition.\n\nPinera said Bachelet, his former presidential election rival, had made accusations against Brazil without evidence, but said that did not justify Bolsonaro\u2019s personal attack.\n\n\u201cThere are differing views on the governments we had in the 70s and 80s but these views should be expressed with respect for the people involved,\u201d Pinera told reporters.\n\n\u201cAs a consequence, I do not in any way share the allusion made by President Bolsonaro with respect to an ex-president of Chile, especially on a subject as painful as the death of her father.\u201d\n\nBetween January and July, Rio police killed 1,075 people, more than five people per day, 20% more than the same period last year and on track to be the highest tally since records began in 2003.\n\nBolsonaro was elected on a pledge to show no mercy to criminals after a dizzying rise in violence in Brazil. He has long praised the work of the police, a pillar of his support.\n\nThe Brazilian Foreign Ministry, in response to Bachelet\u2019s criticism, said in a statement that Bolsonaro was elected by a majority of Brazilian voters with a mandate to improve public security and protect private property.\n\nStepped up police activity was an important component of that mandate and is beginning to show results, the statement said, citing a 21.2 percent drop in the number of murders in Brazil in the first four months of this year.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nBachelet on Wednesday expressed concern over the rise in police violence \u201camidst a public discourse legitimising summary executions.\u201d That discourse, she said, could \u201creinforce the message that state agents are ... able to kill without being held to account.\u201d\n\nShe also criticized \u201ca shrinking of civic and democratic space\u201d in Brazil.\n\nThe foreign ministry statement suggested Bachelet should focus her attention on Venezuela\u2019s \u201cunprecedented humanitarian crisis\u201d instead of making \u201cfalse\u201d comments about Brazil, a democracy where the rule of law prevails, the statement said.", "description": "Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro caused friction with regional ally Chile on Wednesday when he accused its former leader Michelle Bachelet of meddling in Brazil's affairs by criticizing rising police violence and erosions of democracy.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426204793&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF831JB"}
