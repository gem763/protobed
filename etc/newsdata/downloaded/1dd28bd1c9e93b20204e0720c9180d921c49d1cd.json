It\u2019s not.", "language": "en", "text": "Sports columnist\n\nWhen the game was in the balance, when the fans who filed into FedEx Field wearing burgundy hadn\u2019t yet been shamed out of their own building, the Washington Redskins needed a stop from their defense. This is the defense around which this roster has been built. This is the defense that regularly makes statements that resemble this, from cornerback Josh Norman late Sunday afternoon: \u201cWe\u2019re much better than what we\u2019re doing right now.\u201d\n\nAre they?\n\nHow they\u2019re doing right now is lousy, and for every time you hear a player or coach say, \u201cIt\u2019s early,\u201d think about how the defense responded when handed a 7-0 lead in the second quarter of the home opener against Dallas. The Cowboys\u2019 remaining six drives of the game went something like this: touchdown, touchdown, touchdown, field goal, touchdown, ballgame.\n\nNot a single stop, from the middle of the second quarter until the clock ticked to zero on a 31-21 loss that left Washington 0-2. The offense, with a journeyman keeping the seat warm for a rookie at quarterback and unproven players at so many skill positions, has been an acceptable version of itself. The defense? The group\u2019s preseason self-assessments and in-season results are a Lamborghini and a jalopy. They have nothing in common.\n\n\u201cReally, we should be better than this,\u201d Coach Jay Gruden said.\n\n[Too many near-misses doom the Redskins in a frustrating loss to the Cowboys]\n\nHere\u2019s the scary part: What if they\u2019re not? What if the Washington unit that allowed the Cowboys a staggering 474 yards \u2014 including 213 on the ground \u2014 is exactly what we have seen the first two weeks in divisional losses to Philadelphia and Dallas? This, right now, is a bend-and-then-break squad, with its defense shattered all over the kitchen floor in tiny little pieces. Don\u2019t walk through here barefoot. You\u2019ll get cut.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit surprised,\u201d said Norman, the big-money cover guy who was seen most prominently Sunday trying and failing to prevent the 51-yard bomb to Devin Smith that pulled the Cowboys even. \u201cI\u2019d lie to you if I say I wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s shocking, I think not just for myself but everybody else.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s so many ways to peel back this onion, but start with this one: When the Cowboys took over the ball with 4\u00bd minutes remaining in the first half of what was then a tie game, quarterback Dak Prescott missed receiver Michael Gallup on second down. That was \u2014 get this \u2014 the last incompletion Prescott threw for the remainder of the game. Prescott hit on his last 18 passes. Couple that through-the-air accuracy with 23 carries for 111 yards from back Ezekiel Elliott \u2014 whose preseason holdout now seems as ancient as Tony Dorsett \u2014 and this is a difficult offense to stop.\n\n(An aside: If Washington is going to be looking for a new coach at the end of this season, which is a real possibility, owner Daniel Snyder and team president Bruce Allen might have done well to introduce themselves to Kellen Moore before he boarded the Cowboys\u2019 team bus. The 30-year-old first-year offensive coordinator fits the mold of the modern NFL head coach, and the variety of plays he called Sunday \u2014 enabled by some excellent personnel, of course \u2014 was occasionally brilliant.)\n\nStill, good pitching is supposed to beat good hitting. And Washington looks as if it needs more arms.\n\nIn the interest of fairness, it\u2019s worth pointing out that not only was top defensive tackle Jonathan Allen out with a leg injury, but cornerbacks Quinton Dunbar and Fabian Moreau were also inactive. That pressed into action all manner of rookies and pieces off the street.\n\nBut 474 yards?\n\n\u201cThe defensive line and linebackers,\u201d Gruden said, \u201cwe can\u2019t give up 200 yards rushing to anybody \u2014 anytime, anyplace, anywhere.\u201d\n\n[Think the Redskins\u2019 start to the season has been bad? It may be about to get worse.]\n\nAnd on a sunny September Sunday in beautiful Landover, that\u2019s just what they did. The reason the Cowboys scored on those five straight possessions to embolden their own fans at FedEx: They found a way to stay on the field, converting 7 of 11 third downs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get off the field on third downs,\u201d Redskins defensive back Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie said. \u201cWe got to learn how to put a whole game together.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of lament we hear so frequently from this crew as the results appear worse and worse. Want another layer off this onion? Through two games, Washington has allowed 910 yards. In the past 35 years, according to pro-football-reference.com, exactly one Washington team has opened a season by allowing more yards in its first two games. That team: the 2013 squad that was Mike Shanahan\u2019s last here, a season that ended in a 3-13 death spiral.\n\nCan this defense prevent that kind of result over the remaining 14 games? In discussing that possibility, Gruden and others made sure to say there were \u201cno excuses\u201d before listing the injured players as excuses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re the most experienced group,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re very talented, yes. But experienced, we\u2019re still fighting through some things. A very young defense, so there\u2019s a lot to look forward to, without a doubt. But we do have to play better.\u201d\n\nMaybe \u2014 maybe \u2014 there\u2019s the talent here to do it. The defense does have a first-round pick from each of the past three drafts in Allen, fellow tackle Daron Payne and rookie end Montez Sweat. It imported safety Landon Collins from the Giants this offseason. Norman believes he is elite, even as results show otherwise. Ageless Ryan Kerrigan had the only sack of Prescott on Sunday.\n\nBut what evidence is there that those pieces actually make a good unit?\n\n\u201cWe can say we have a great defense,\u201d rookie cornerback Jimmy Moreland said, speaking a dose of the truth. \u201cBut we have to go out there and play like that.\u201d\n\nThis is Gruden\u2019s sixth season here. His previous five defenses have ranked, in points allowed, 29th, 17th, 19th, 28th and 15th. In yards allowed, the ranks were 20th, 28th, 28th, 27th and 17th. The best unit \u2014 last year\u2019s \u2014 barely cracked the top half of the league in either category. That\u2019s not just injuries. It\u2019s not just facing good offenses. It\u2019s mediocre-to-terrible defenses year after year after year.\n\nSo could it be coaching? Coordinator Greg Manusky is in his third season at the helm. Gruden, an offensive coach by trade, said he is spending a significant amount of time game-planning with him during the week.\n\n\u201cWe have a very talented group on defense, and we\u2019re not reaching them,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe have to play better, and we will play better.\u201d\n\nIf not, then hope Snyder and Allen got Moore\u2019s number \u2014 or have any sort of plan for what\u2019s going to happen beyond this season.\n\nFor more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.", "description": "Washington wasn\u2019t able to stop the Cowboys on Sunday, a week after folding against the Eagles.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist", "September At Pm", "Barry Svrluga Became A Sports Columnist For The Washington Post In December He Arrived At The Post In To Cover Football", "Basketball At The University Of Maryland"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/k96m6iXOn3GQfz2avC-7E8otVL0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DSFK2AGX7QI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
