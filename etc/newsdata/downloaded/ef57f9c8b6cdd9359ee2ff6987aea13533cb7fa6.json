Leading Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have opposed most efforts to restrain political donations.\n\nThe proposal comes as Sanders, 78, is recovering from a health scare that forced him to cancel campaign events last week.\n\nOn Friday, his campaign said Sanders had suffered a heart attack but that he would be back on the campaign trail soon.\n\nSanders trails former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren for the Democratic nomination in most national opinion polls.\n\nBut his campaign said last week it raised $25.3 million in mostly small donations in the third quarter of this year, outstripping all other Democrats in the 2020 race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Simon Lewis; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "description": "Sanders, one of 19 Democrats competing to take on Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election, would replace the Federal Election Commission with \"a true law enforcement agency\" and rid party conventions and presidential inauguration ceremonies of corporate sponsorship,", "authors": ["Simon Lewis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/02CIk2oguWzKk4PyW_atWg--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/e7aac8444b615fdfcbfcbbfd2a3f206a", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
