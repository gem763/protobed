But the Tory peer did reveal one person inspired him to write about the shady character: Margaret Thatcher (left)\n\nBut the Tory peer did reveal one person inspired him to write about the shady character: Margaret Thatcher.\n\nAfter Thatcher cast him out from her inner circle in 1987, Dobbs fled to the island of Gozo to recover. There, he decided to try his hand at writing \u2014 but at the end of the first day had scrawled only the initials of a unprintable expletive aimed at the woman who ousted him: 'F.U.'\n\nThose letters later became Francis Urquhart (and Frank Underwood in the U.S. adaptation).\n\n'House Of Cards has millions of fans,' said Dobbs. 'And it's all down to Mrs Thatcher.'\n\nYet another reason to admire our first woman PM.\n\nThe wrong pass? Off you go, sir . . .\n\nDespite it being briefed to every media outlet, not everyone at conference got the memo that yesterday's policy focus was on law and order.\n\nJust after lunchtime, part of the venue went into lockdown after one of Boris's most senior MPs, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, was involved in a verbal dust-up with police and staff after it transpired the Cotswolds MP's wife had the wrong pass to gain entry to the International Lounge.\n\nHours later, Home Secretary Priti Patel pledged a crackdown against criminals. Clifton-Brown, meanwhile, had been sent home.\n\nBrutal reality of the day . . .\n\nIn his speech yesterday, Tory London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey said: 'Since I last stood in front of you last year, more than 100 people have been murdered in our capital city; 4,000 people have been stabbed; 20,000 have been sexually assaulted; 70,000 homes have been burgled.\n\nBut the Mayor Sadiq Khan spends his time building 'Brand Khan' \u2014 hosting beach parties, bidding for Labour leadership and plastering his own face all over our city.'\n\nThe Rees-Mogg political dynasty is about to get another member\n\nThe Rees-Mogg political dynasty is about to get another member.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg's niece, Theodora Clarke, has been selected as the Tory candidate for the safe seat of Stafford.\n\n'Theo' certainly has the Rees\u2013Mogg flourish when it comes to rhetoric.\n\nShe once described her uncle as 'a well-spoken mortician, come to collect the corpse of compassion'.\n\nAt a fringe event, Sajid Javid was asked if he had read the David Cameron book. 'No,' he said.\n\nWhen the audience was asked the same question, there was silence. 'It's popular then,' quipped Javid.\n\nCONFESSION OF THE DAY: Boris was asked by Nick Ferrari on LBC what he thought of the saga sparked by BBC presenter Naga Munchetty's comments about Trump and racism.\n\nHe looked puzzled and replied: 'Naga who? I've never heard of her. Have my team heard of her?'\n\nYes, Boris, they have.\n\nOne of the biggest sellers at the conference bookshop is the first volume of Parliament: The Biography \u2014 even though the author, Chris Bryant, is a Labour MP.\n\nAs for David Cameron's new memoir For The Record, it's on Amazon for \u00a314.12 \u2014 a discount of more than \u00a310.", "description": "ANDREW PIERCE: Tory peer Michael Dobbs revealed one person inspired him to write about the shady character: Margaret Thatcher (pictured).", "authors": ["Andrew Pierce For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/01/19181626-0-image-a-43_1569975506634.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
