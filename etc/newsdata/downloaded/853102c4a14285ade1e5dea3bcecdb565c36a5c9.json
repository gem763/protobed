Quietly but just as resolutely, lawmakers expanded their inquiry, promising a broad new subpoena for documents and witnesses.\n\nDemocratic leaders put the White House on notice that the wide-ranging subpoena would be coming for information about Trump\u2019s actions in the Ukraine controversy, the latest move in an impeachment probe that\u2019s testing the Constitution\u2019s system of checks and balances. They said they\u2019d be going to court if necessary.\n\nAmid the legal skirmishing, it was a day of verbal fireworks.\n\nThe president complained that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was handing out subpoenas \u201clike cookies,\u201d railed against a government whistleblower as \u201cvicious\u201d and assailed the news media as corrupt and the \u201cenemy.\u201d All that alongside a presidential tweetstorm punctuated with an accusation that congressional Democrats waste time and money on \u201cBULL----.\u201d\n\nPelosi said Democrats had no choice but to take on the most \u201csolemn\u201d of constitutional responsibilities to put a check on executive power after the national security whistleblower\u2019s complaint that recently came to light . The administration and Congress are on a collision course unseen in a generation after the whistleblower exposed a July phone call the president had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which Trump pressed for an investigation of Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his family.\n\n\u201cWe take this to be a very sad time\u201d for the American people and the country, Pelosi said. \u201cImpeaching the president isn\u2019t anything to be joyful about.\u201d\n\nStanding beside her, intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff accused Trump of \u201can incitement to violence\u201d with his attacks on the unnamed whistleblower, who is provided anonymity and other protections under federal law. He said the investigation is proceeding \u201cdeliberately\u201d but also with a sense of \u201curgency.\u201d\n\nUnlike Trump, Schiff never raised his voice but said firmly: \u201cWe\u2019re not fooling around here.\u201d\n\nPelosi, in a \u201cGood Morning America\u201d interview that will air Thursday, said Trump is \u201cscared\u201d of the impeachment inquiry and the arguments that can be made against him.\n\nDemocrats are now talking of basing an impeachment charge of obstruction on the White House\u2019s slow-walking of documents and testimony -- administration actions that echo the months of resisting Congress in its other investigations into special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report and Trump\u2019s business dealings.\n\nAhead of the new subpoena, the chairmen of three House committees accused the administration of \u201cflagrant disregard\u201d of previous requests for documents and witnesses and said that refusal could be considered an impeachable offense.\n\nThe standoff took on a defiant tone this week when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he would not stand for Democrats \u201cbullying\u201d his employees into appearing before the congressional committees, even as he acknowledged that he, too, had been among those U.S. officials listening on the line during the Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukraine leader.\n\nPompeo\u2019s admission is complicating his situation, and House leaders now consider him a \u201cwitness\u201d to Trump\u2019s interaction with Ukraine.\n\nOne former State Department official, Kurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, will appear Thursday for a closed-door interview with House investigators. He is said to be eager to tell his side of the story. That\u2019s ahead of next week\u2019s deposition of ousted U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Maria \u201cMasha\u201d Yovanovitch.\n\nThe circumstances of Yovanovitch\u2019s sudden recall from Ukraine are the subject of conspiracy speculation, and the State Department\u2019s Inspector General Michael Steve Linick sought an \u201curgent\u201d meeting Wednesday to brief staff of several committees.\n\nDuring that private session, Linick told them he received a packet of materials from the State Department\u2019s Counsel T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, according to one person granted anonymity to discuss the closed-door session.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said the package contained information from debunked conspiracy theories about Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 election. Trump has long pursued those theories, a topic he discussed with Zelenskiy in the phone call that sparked the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIt was unclear where the package originated, but it was in a White House envelope and included folders from Trump hotels, according to another person familiar with the briefing, a Democrat. That person said the White House sent the envelope to Pompeo and it contained notes from interviews that took place in the New York City office of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, with various Ukrainians about the debunked conspiracies.\n\n\u201cIt raises more questions than it answers,\u201d said Raskin. Brechbuhl has also been called to give a deposition to the House.\n\nTrump, in appearances in the Oval Office and a joint press conference with the president of Finland, displayed an unusual show of anger as he defended what he has called his \u201cperfect\u201d phone call with Zelenskiy and decried the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAt one point, he demanded that a reporter pressing him on his dealings with Ukraine move on, labeling the journalist \u201ccorrupt.\u201d Earlier in the day he said even though he popularized the phrase \u201cfake news,\u201d he now preferred to say \u201ccorrupt\u201d news. \u201cThis is a hoax,\u201d Trump said.\n\nLater he called himself, as he has before, a \u201cvery stable genius\u201d who always watches what he says in conversations.\n\nTrump has tweeted in recent days that he wants to \u201cfind out about\u201d the whistleblower and question him or her, though the person\u2019s identity is protected by the Whistleblower Protection Act.\n\nSchiff\u2019s spokesman acknowledged that the whistleblower had come to the intelligence committee before filing the formal complaint but said the staff advised the person to contact an inspector general and seek counsel, and at no point did the committee review or receive the complaint in advance.\n\nTrump suggested, without any evidence, that Schiff \u201cprobably helped write\u201d the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. The whistleblower\u2019s lawyers said the person had never met or spoken with Schiff about the matter.\n\nThe new subpoena coming Friday from House Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings will be directed toward acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and request 13 separate batches of documents concerning the July call and related matters. The call came against the backdrop of a $250 million foreign aid package for Ukraine that was being readied by Congress but stalled by Trump.\n\nThe whistleblower alleged in August that the White House tried to \u201clock down\u201d Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with the new Ukrainian president because it was worried about the contents being leaked to the public. The acting director of national intelligence eventually made the complaint public.\n\nIn recent days, it has been disclosed that the administration similarly tried to restrict information about Trump\u2019s calls with other foreign leaders, including Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman, by moving memos onto a highly classified computer system.\n\nIn Russia, Putin said scrutiny over the phone call showed that Trump\u2019s adversaries are using \u201cevery excuse\u201d to attack him.", "description": "Agitated and angry, President Donald Trump squared off against House Democrats on Wednesday, packing his increasingly aggressive impeachment defense with...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS534_19trum_ZG_20191002210940.jpg"}
