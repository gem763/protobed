Meanwhile, \u201csuccessful companies tend to have very individual paths,\u201d says Bergson, 54.\n\nBergson uses a factor-based approach to give investors exposure to the broader small-cap universe\u2014minus the worst of the worst. The goal is to capture the outsize return characteristics of small companies, while keeping stock-specific risks and trading costs in check. Over the past decade, the fund (ticker: NSGRX) has returned an average of more than 12% a year, putting it ahead of 87% of its small-blend peers and the Russell 2000 index.\n\nBefore Bergson set out to design the perfect small-cap portfolio, he studied architecture at Carnegie Mellon University and worked in the field for six years. He eventually realized that his strengths were more technical than artistic. \u201cMy designs worked well, but from an aesthetic point of view, they left something to be desired,\u201d says Bergson. He left architecture to get a master\u2019s degree in real-estate development and finance from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; he specialized in real-estate research before starting his investment career at Northern Trust Asset Management in 1997.\n\nBergson initially put his quantitative skills to work managing index funds and tax-efficient portfolios, but soon turned his attention to small companies, which are his sole focus today. \u201cI wanted to understand where you get rewarded for the risk you take and how to avoid the sorts of risks you don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting rewarded for,\u201d says Bergson. He developed his small-cap strategy in 1999 and brought it along when he took over the Northern Small Cap Core fund in 2010. The solution, he concluded, is to divide the small-cap universe into three parts: microcap stocks, value stocks, and growth stocks.\n\nBefore Bergson runs screens on the benchmark, he carves out space for some of the smallest publicly traded companies, which have market values of less than $750 million and account for about 30% of the fund\u2019s assets and 70% of its roughly 1,600 holdings.\n\n\u201cSome of the biggest outsize returns in the space come from the smallest segments of the small-cap universe,\u201d he says, noting that stocks added to the Russell 2000 returned, on average, more than double the index in the year prior. Admittedly, these results are positively skewed\u2014the stocks make it into the index because they outperformed\u2014\u201cbut if you don\u2019t have exposure to them, you miss out on a big portion of that upside,\u201d he says. As an added benefit, microcap stocks have a slightly lower correlation to the broader market, he says. In a big selloff, he says, \u201cWhat do investors sell first? It\u2019s not the microcaps. It\u2019s larger, more liquid securities.\u201d\n\nNorthern Small Cap Core Note: Holdings as of 6/30. Returns through 9/3; 5- and ten-year returns are annualized.

Instead, they aim to own a large sample that reflects sector weightings of the Russell 2000, and keep trading to a minimum. \u201cYou let the market, in a sense, reward that exposure,\u201d says Bergson, whose portfolio turnover was recently just 21%.\n\nA large number of these tiny stocks eventually graduate out of the fund because of size\u2014as was the case with cloud-based tech company Wix.com (WIX), whose market value was $275 million when the fund bought it in 2015 and $6 billion when the fund sold it this year. Others, including Straight Path Communications and Loxo Oncology, leave via acquisition.\n\nThe rest of the fund focuses on owning equal parts value and growth in the Russell 2000 index, except for likely laggards. Bergson uses slightly different models for scoring value and growth companies. \u201cOn the value side, we\u2019re looking at quality of earnings, sources of financing, and efficiency,\u201d he says, noting that these factors all speak to a company\u2019s ability to generate free cash flow.\n\nFor growth stocks, the models focus on earnings stability, growth rates, and investments in future growth. Companies that rank at the bottom of these screens land on the do-not-buy list.\n\n\u201cEven if a company has a successful product, but is not well managed, the likelihood of success is much reduced,\u201d he says. \u201cWe see that sort of repeated through history.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s far easier to identify companies that are least likely to succeed, he says. That emphasis on what not to buy helps minimize turnover and saves on trading costs. Eight of the fund\u2019s recent top 10 holdings have been in the portfolio since Bergson took over in 2010, with Woodward (WWD) in the lead spot. The company has a $6.6 billion market value and is the world\u2019s largest independent designer, manufacturer, and service provider of control systems and components for aircraft engines, industrial engines, and power generators. Also on the list are Exponen t (EXPO), a $3.7 billion engineering and scientific consulting firm, and Haemonetics (HAE), a $6.6 billion global provider of blood and plasma supplies and services.\n\nMany of these names have grown large enough to graduate from the Russell 2000 to the large-cap benchmark, the Russell 1000, but size isn\u2019t an immediate trigger to sell. Here, too, Bergson says, some of the biggest gains happen when companies are on the cusp. Indeed, while the foundation of the strategy is factor-based, Bergson and his team have enough leeway to optimize returns: \u201cThat\u2019s part of what we do as humans, as portfolio managers.\u201d\n\nEmail: editors@barrons.com", "description": "Bob Bergson, manager of the Northern Small Cap Core fund, uses a factor-based approach to give investors exposure to the broader small-cap universe\u2014minus the worst of the worst.", "authors": ["Sarah Max"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-103482/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
