The singer has no qualms about getting evicted from the reality show at an early stage.\n\n\"I think it was one of the most memorable times of my life. I have no complaints of any kind regarding anything that happened there,\" Abu told IANS,\n\n\"I think what they expected me to do was to find a connection, I didn't agree to it,\" the singer said when asked about the reason he got evicted. Will he do thing differently if he goes back as a wild card entry?\n\n\"Yes, I will try to do things differently but I am not sure of what kind of things,\" said the brother of singer Anu Malik. Talking about the show, Abu said,\n\n\"The show has been one of the most exciting and unpredictable experiences of my life. From meeting different people to dealing with conflicting egos and temperaments, the house has definitely taught me a lot about life and myself. I have discovered a different side to myself and I am leaving the house with a lot of positivity.\"\n\nDon't Miss 1.3 K SHARES 5.2 K SHARES 2.7 K SHARES 276 SHARES\n\nAt this stage, Abu says Shahnaz Gill, Siddharth Shukla and Rashmi Desai are playing well. Echoing similar thoughts as earlier evicted contestants Dalljeet and Koena, Abu spoke to Indian express and said,\n\n\"Yes, absolutely because she has realised that the girls are not going to support her at all. She is playing to the gallery and totally to the hilt. She has the support and favour of Salman Khan and she has a good wit. She knows how to use it. She is also very clever in manipulating the voters and the people who are watching her by hitting out to them or playing to the gallery throughout the day. She thought the best way to survive in the game is by getting friendly with the boys.\"\n\nAbu was evicted on Monday. He is the third contestant to be ousted from the house, with Daljiet Kaur being the first contestant to be evicted from the 13th season of the controversial reality show, which is aired on Colors channel.", "description": "Abu was evicted on Monday.
