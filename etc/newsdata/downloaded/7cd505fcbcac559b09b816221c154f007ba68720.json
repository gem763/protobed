He tweets on politics and world affairs @NeilClark66\n\nIdentity politics is shamelessly exploited by pro-war western Establishments to promote certain candidates, but only those who promote the \u2018right\u2019 elite-friendly policy stances.\n\nShe\u2019s the first from her ethnic background to make it to Congress, and the first of her religion too. And of course, she\u2019s a woman as well. Now you might have thought that those PC hipsters and Inside the Tent self-proclaimed \u2018feminists\u2019 who championed \u2018Hillary for President\u2019 not so long ago, and were telling us what a huge advance it would be for women around the globe for the US to have its first female president, would be falling over themselves to endorse Tulsi Gabbard, who not only has the right sex, but ticks other diversity boxes too.\n\nBut guess what? They\u2019re not. Far from it. A lot of these people have been at the forefront of those attacking Tulsi. They not only don\u2019t want her as President, they don\u2019t want her in debates either. All of a sudden ticking gender, race and religious boxes isn\u2019t so important. Gabbard once met Assad, and that puts her out of it.\n\nAlso on rt.com Gabbard campaign joins voices raising concerns over Democrat debate-qualifying criteria\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that Wall Street Democratic donors, the people who lined up with their check-books behind Hillary in 2016, have threatened to sit things out \u2013 or even back Trump \u2013 if the surging Elizabeth Warren gets the party nomination over Joe Biden. Don\u2019t we want a female President after all, you \u2018enlightened\u2019 capitalists?\n\nWhat this all shows us is that ID politics is used selectively, to maintain the elite-friendly status quo, by giving it a \u2018progressive\u2019 veneer.\n\nWomen to lead the country \u2013 great! But it\u2019s not so great if the women in question rail against regime-change wars, as Gabbard does, or are outspoken critics of the big banks and giant corporations, like Warren.\n\nTrans women in politics \u2013 great! But again, it\u2019s not so great if she\u2019s Chelsea Manning, a brave whistleblower who helps us see behind the curtain and exposes imperial crimes.\n\nAlso on rt.com Chelsea Manning jailed for a YEAR for refusing to testify against Assange\n\nMuslim women in politics \u2013 great! But not so great if they overstep the mark and criticise entrenched foreign policy lobby groups, like Ilhan Omar has.\n\nIt\u2019s not just in the US where ID politics is used in this way. It happens in Britain too. Consider how the Murdoch press has been promoting the Labour MP Jess Phillips as a feminist icon and potential future leader of her party, most recently putting the \u2019fearless\u2019 politician on the front cover of last week\u2019s Sunday Times magazine. Now, Phillips has many admirable qualities and I\u2019m not going to denigrate her, but does anyone seriously think that a female Labour MP who was a strong supporter of Jeremy Corbyn would be promoted in such a way by News Corp?\n\nConsider too the treatment of Ed Miliband, who preceded Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party. He might have become Britain\u2019s first Jewish Prime Minister since the 19th century. Surely a cause for celebration, if you believe in fighting anti-Semitism and promoting religious diversity? But Miliband was lambasted for helping to prevent David Cameron\u2019s drive for war against Syria in 2013, and all of a sudden it wasn\u2019t so cool to have a Jewish prime minister. Support for Miliband within the Establishment disappeared the moment it was clear we were not going to bomb Damascus because of his actions.\n\nAlso on rt.com Liberal media puzzled: Openly gay Brnabic & Weidel prefer hard work to aggressive PC campaigning\n\nPoliticians who you\u2019d think might be promoted because of their gender, sexuality and/or ethnic background, but who don\u2019t \u2018convince\u2019 on foreign policy don\u2019t get the big Establishment media PR push. Have you heard of Sahra Wagenknecht? She\u2019s the leader of the Left Party (Die Linke), in the German Bundestag. She\u2019s bright and has ethnic heritage (her father is Iranian). She\u2019s very photogenic too. And she\u2019s a brilliant public speaker. But how many can place her name outside of Germany? I\u2019m sure if her politics were different, she\u2019d be known across the western world by now.\n\nBy applying ID politics selectively, the pro-war neoliberal Establishment is actually putting the cause of genuine anti-sexism, anti-racism and anti-homophobia backwards. Because we know that if there was a candidate who ticked every single diversity box \u2013 but who opposed foreign military interventions and who represented the prospect of real, meaningful change, they would be ruthlessly attacked. ID politics is great, and so cool, ok ya, \u2013 so long as it doesn\u2019t rock the boat.\n\nFollow Neil Clark @NeilClark66\n\nLike this story?
