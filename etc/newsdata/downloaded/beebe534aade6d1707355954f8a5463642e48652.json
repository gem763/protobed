And for the tween characters whose growing pains are the subject of this beloved adult cartoon, which returned for a third season on Friday, that means emotions\u2014and hormones\u2014are running high. Budding feminist Jessi (Jessi Klein) finds outrage fuel everywhere she looks. After humiliating himself in a desperate attempt to win back his ex-girlfriend Missy (Jenny Slate), in February\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day special, dweeby Andrew (John Mulaney) remains a pariah at Bridgeton Middle. Jay (Jason Mantzoukas), a voracious horndog who\u2019s starting to realize he\u2019s bisexual, can\u2019t stop staring at so much newly exposed flesh.\n\nWithin the first few minutes of the season 3 premiere, Jay\u2019s chaotic libido causes a shop-class crisis: distracted by two attractive classmates in tank tops (who he pictures as juicy cooked turkeys), he saws off the tip of Andrew\u2019s finger. Especially if you\u2019re not familiar with the show, this probably doesn\u2019t sound like the setup for one of the year\u2019s best TV episodes. Yet there\u2019s no better example of the genius of Big Mouth\u2014a comedy that nails the sophomoric physical humor of preadolescence but whose hilarious portrait of puberty is really a mirror held up to adult sexuality\u2014more than what follows. In the space of a half hour, writers Hayley Adams, Joellen Redlingshafer and Kelsey Cressman demonstrate in remarkably nuanced detail how cultural ideas about women\u2019s sexuality can make people of all genders miserable. And they keep you laughing the whole time.\n\nWhen it comes out that Jay was salivating over shoulders when the accident happened, Bridgeton\u2019s Dean of Students decides that instead of punishing the boy, he\u2019s going to instate a dress code. \u201cThe male students can\u2019t control themselves. They\u2019re animals. That\u2019s not their fault,\u201d the performatively woke administrator explains at an assembly on \u201ctoxic masculinity.\u201d A ban on revealing clothing for female students, he says, will \u201cprotect our strong, empowered women from the white-hot male gaze.\u201d What\u2019s absurd isn\u2019t just that Jay was actually ogling a girl and a boy when he hurt Andrew; it\u2019s that the dean simultaneously calls female students \u201cempowered,\u201d frames them as victims and punishes them for a boy\u2019s actions. To further compound the ironies, the girls keep raising good questions (\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just teach the boys some impulse control?\u201d) and getting ignored.\n\nIf you\u2019ve watched much TV in the past decade, you can probably see the writers winding up to a statement against slut-shaming; in this case, it comes complete with the Bridgeton girls\u2019 very own musical \u201cAmber Rose SlutWalk\u201d protest. But where many other shows would be satisfied with that tidy moral, Big Mouth keeps zooming out to examine how the adults\u2019 mixed messages about female sexuality\u2014and the kids\u2019 own miscommunications\u2014affect each of the characters. Jessi reluctantly dons a crop top, but feels uncomfortable in her own skin. Missy battles her self-hating alter ego, \u201cMirror Missy,\u201d and ultimately comes to the protest in the same gender-neutral clothing she always wears, only to be branded a traitor by the other girls.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

And what are they actually supposed to do about sexual urges they\u2019ve been taught are impossible to control? Insecure, under-developed Nick (co-creator Nick Kroll) knows sexism when he sees it, but, as he explains to his family, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the guy who calls other guys misogynists.\u201d When he finally musters the courage to be a \u201cgood ally,\u201d the wrong words come out of his mouth, and he offends the girls anyway. Already smarting from Missy\u2019s very public rejection, Andrew turns mean. In a subplot that skis the slippery slope of white male anger, he airs his grievances\u2014\u201dIt\u2019s just hard to be a boy these days!\u201d\u2014on the internet and ends up at a \u201cmen\u2019s rights\u201d meeting that soon devolves into a veritable neo-Nazi rally.\n\nThere is traditionally a lot of hugging and learning in shows set at middle school, which are mostly aimed at even younger kids. Yet this episode, titled \u201cGirls Are Angry Too,\u201d leans into messiness. An argument that pits well-meaning but clueless Nick against an increasingly irate Jessi acknowledges that, because we can\u2019t physically inhabit each other\u2019s bodies, communication between men and women will always be fraught. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like being a girl!\u201d she cries, before reaching the sudden epiphany that the only way of bridging the gender divide \u201cmight just be this long conversation that we have to keep having!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad!\u201d Nick yells back. If only more adults could have such productive fights.\n\nDespite the animation, the masturbation jokes and the presence of furry \u201chormone monsters\u201d who guide the characters through puberty, something like maturity grounds the show\u2019s best episodes. Kroll and his co-creators, Andrew Goldberg, Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett, understand that preadolescence is more than just a series of awkwardly funny rites of passage; they set the tone for our lifelong relationships with gender, sexuality, ourselves and other people. (In a telling scene from \u201cGirls Are Angry Too,\u201d a parents\u2019 meeting about the dress code quickly devolves into a screaming match.) In revisiting middle school, Big Mouth sorts through some of the heaviest cultural baggage we all acquire during those years without even realizing it.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "In the space of a half-hour, the Netflix show demonstrates how cultural ideas about women's sexuality can make people of all genders miserable.", "authors": ["Judy Berman"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/big_mouth_s03e02_7m46s11194f.png?w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
