Whether that leaves a gap or not, it's a job to know.\"\n\nAlso The National Pig Association said that meat process were \u201cconcerned about not fulfilling orders\u201d.\n\nThousands of tonnes of home grown fruit and veg is currently being left to rot in fields as migrant farm workers have deserted the UK.\n\nWith the number of pickers \u2013 mainly from Eastern Europe \u2013 plummeting the food waste is likely to push up prices in supermarkets with apples and berries the hardest hit.\n\nMany farms and factories in the meat industry were already suffering shortfalls over the summer before the additional migrant workers they rely on in the weeks before Christmas.\n\nNational Pig Association senior policy advisor Ed Barker said a number of processors were \"concerned about not fulfilling orders\" and that labour shortages were now also biting in abattoirs and on pig farms.\n\nFresh food producers had previously reported similar shortages for crop pickers and processing plant workers in recent weeks leading to fears of price rises and shortages for fruit and veg as much of it was left to rot in fields as there were not enough workers to pick it all.", "description": "Bacon, ham and pork could be in short supply as seasonal migrant workers leave the UK, warn industry bosses", "authors": ["Ruki Sayid", "Mark Solomons", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13691040.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Christmas-turkey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
