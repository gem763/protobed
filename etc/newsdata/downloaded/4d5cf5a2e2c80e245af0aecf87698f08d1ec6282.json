Very limited, according to ophthalmologist Dr. Denize Atan, the lead author reporting the boy\u2019s case in the latest issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\n\u201cHis diet was essentially a portion of chips from the local fish and chip shop every day,\u201d Atan told the BBC. \u201cHe also used to snack on [chips] \u2015 Pringles \u2015 and sometimes slices of white bread and occasional slices of ham, and not really any fruit and vegetables.\u201d\n\nAtan said the patient told her that he had an aversion to certain textures and that \u201cchips and crisps were really the only types of food that he wanted and felt that he could eat.\u201d\n\nThe teen was eventually diagnosed with nutritional optic neuropathy \u2015 damage to the optic nerve that results from nutritional deficiencies. The condition can be caused by drugs, malabsorption of food, poor diet or alcohol abuse, but \u201cpurely dietary causes are rare in developed countries,\u201d LiveScience reported.\n\nVision loss from nutritional optic neuropathy can be reversed if the condition is found early enough, but the teen\u2019s vision loss is permanent, doctors said. They added that nutritional supplements may prevent his vision loss from getting any worse.\n\nThe patient was referred to mental health services for his eating disorder.", "description": "The patient told doctors that he had an aversion to\u00a0certain textures and that chips and fries \"were really the only types of food he felt that he could e...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d792e81800006c32bd105e.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
