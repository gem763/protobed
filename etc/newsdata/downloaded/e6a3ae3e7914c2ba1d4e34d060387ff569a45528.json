The Nasdaq Composite index retreated 7 points, or 0.1%, to reach 7,992.\n\nOn Monday, the Dow rose 96.58 points, or 0.4%, to end at 26,916.83, while the S&P 500 index advanced 14.95 points, or 0.5%, to finish at 2,976.74. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,999.34, a gain of 6.91 points, or 0.1%.\n\nFor the month of September, the Dow gained 2%, the S&P advanced 1.7% and the Nasdaq added 0.5%. For the quarter, the Dow and the S&P 500 both rose 1.2%, but the Nasdaq fell 0.1%.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nThe ISM's September survey on manufacturing firms registered at 47.8%, down from 49.1% in July, below the 50.2% predicted by economists polled by MarketWatch, and the worst reading since June 2009. (link)Any reading below 50% indicates contraction.\n\nThe data showed that new orders for manufactured goods fell for the second month in a row, though at a slightly slower pace, while the export orders subcomponent of the survey came in at 41%, the lowest level since March 2009. Some survey respondents blamed higher U.S. and Chinese tariffs for weakness in their businesses.\n\n\"Global trade remains the most significant issue, as demonstrated by the contraction in new export orders that began in July 2019,\" said Timothy R. Fiore, Chair of the Institute for Supply Management, in a press release. \"Overall, sentiment this month remains cautious regarding near-term growth,\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank's most recent interest rate cuts have helped to maintain the economic expansion now in its record-setting 11th year, despite headwinds from a year-long Sino-American trade dispute.\n\nEvans estimated that annual economic growth should be around 2.25% in 2019, which he described as a \"a solid number, as it exceeds my view of the economy's long-run potential growth rate,\" in the text of a speech to be delivered in Frankfurt.\n\n\"The mood is optimistic as we begin the final trading quarter of this year. Despite deep threats of impeachment over in the US, the S&P 500 index is still up over 18%, the Dow Jones 15.3% and the Nasdaq 20.56%,\" wrote Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets U.K., in a Tuesday research note.\n\nHowever, the World Trade Organization on Tuesday said (link) trade flows this year are set to increase at the weakest pace since the 2008 financial crisis brought the global economy to its knees.\n\n\"Job creation may be hampered as firms employ fewer workers to produce goods and services for export,\" said Roberto Azev\u00eado, the WTO's director general, in the most recent global forecast by the Geneva-based organization.\n\nThe U.S. and China are due to hold talks in mid-October in an effort to make progress on resolving the nearly two year old trade dispute. Meanwhile, China is reported to have bought about another one million tons of U.S. soybeans (link) but US farm exports are down about 7% from 2018 (link). Farmers in the U.S. Midwest are facing the most difficult conditions since the 1980s as a result, the Wall Street Journal reported. (link)\n\nMeanwhile, President Xi Jinping presided over a military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. During protests planned to coincide with the celebration, a Hong Kong protester was reportedly shot (link) in the chest with a live round, representing a possible major escalation in the conflict between China and the semiautonomous nation on Tuesday.\n\nSeparately, markets continue to pay attention developments related to President Donald Trump's impeachment inquiry after the Wall Street Journal reported (link) that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo listened in on the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a disclosure that ties the State Department more closely to the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nCharles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) shares tumbled early Tuesday after the company announced it \"stocks, ETFs and options listed on U.S. or Canadian exchanges, across all mobile and web trading channels.' Rivals TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC) were also trading sharply lower.\n\nMcCormick & Co. (MKC) reported fiscal third-quarter profit (link) that beat expectations, and raised its full-year 2019 outlook Tuesday morning, sending shares higher Tuesday morning. The company came up short of revenue expectations, however.\n\nShares of Bausch Health Cos. Inc. (BHC.T) were under pressure Tuesday after the pharmaceutical firm said it is filing a lawsuit (link) against Novartis AG (NOVN.EB) subsidiary Sandoz for patent infringement.\n\nFord Motor Co. (F) said Tuesday that it will book an impairment charge (link) of between $800 million and $900 million related to a sale of its assets based to Indian auto maker Mahindra & Mahindra.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell about 3 basis points to 1.652% after the U.S. ISM manufacturing sector purchasing managers index fell further into contraction. (link)\n\nIn commodities markets, West Texas Intermediate crude-oil for November delivery gained 15 cents to about $54 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a day after a 3.3% drop for the commodity.\n\nGold for December delivery rose about $7 to reach $1,480 an ounce after finishing Monday's session at a two-month low.\n\nIn Asia, Chinese benchmarks were closed in observance of its 70th anniversary. Japan's Nikkei 225 , meanwhile, gained 0.6%, wiping out a similar loss from Monday. European stocks were mostly lower, with the Stoxx Europe 600 , down 1.1%.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 01, 2019 10:39 ET (14:39 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
