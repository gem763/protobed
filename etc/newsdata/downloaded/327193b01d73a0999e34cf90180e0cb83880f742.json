If that happens, the efforts of the current prime minister to achieve Brexit on 31 October could be seriously frustrated.\"\n\nLegal challenge\n\nJohnson's rivals in Parliament are now forging new alliances and trying to attach amendments that could either force Johnson to accept closer trade ties - or abandon the deal and accept a third delay this year.\n\nThe option of extending the three-and-a-half year crisis past the October 31 deadline is now in the hands of the 27 remaining EU member states.\n\nJohnson, who took office promising to deliver Brexit on schedule, was mandated in legislation known as the Benn Act passed by UK legislators - including a \"rebel alliance\" of 21 Conservative MPs who were subsequently kicked out of the party - to send a letter to Brussels asking for more time.\n\nThe British leader ended up sending three letters on Saturday night. The only one he actually signed said an \"extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners\" and that he was firmly against it.\n\nThe manoeuvre was designed to minimise the political damage of Johnson going back on his word and seeking an extension ahead of an early general election most expect in the coming months.\n\nThe top civil court in Scotland on Monday considered whether Johnson's request broke the law, and an undertaking his administration made to the court not to frustrate the Benn Act.\n\nThe Court of Sessions in Edinburgh ruled against the government's request to throw out the case, and while the court said the signed letter did not undermine the request for a delay - essentially carrying no legal weight at all - it would continue to monitor the situation to ensure the prime minister abided by the law.\n\nSaturday sitting\n\nJohnson's first effort to get parliamentary backing for the deal he sealed against heavy odds last Thursday in Brussels was scuttled at a very rare Saturday sitting of MPs.\n\nLegislators pushed through an amendment obliging Johnson to ask for an extension until the British legislation governing the withdrawal is drafted and passed.\n\nThe step was designed to cut off the possibility of Johnson following through on his repeated threat to take Britain out at any cost at the end of the month.\n\nAnalysts said the process - even when fast-tracked - would normally take several weeks.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow might tell Johnson on Monday that he cannot bring what is effectively the same legislation back for a second vote.\n\nThis would switch the focus on the government's attempt on Tuesday to get legislators to support domestic legislation in the accompanying Withdrawal Agreement Bill.\n\nSuccess or failure then would set the course for the coming week and largely determine whether Johnson will get his October 31 divorce.\n\nDealmaking\n\nThe deck seems stacked against Johnson.\n\nThe main opposition Labour Party is trying to create a cross-party alliance that would back Johnson's deal on the condition that it is fixed to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU.\n\nJohnson and his supporters say this would kill the point of Brexit by keeping Britain tied to Europe and unable to strike its own trade deals with powers such as China and the United States.\n\nLabour is trying to create a quick marriage of convenience with Johnson's nominal allies in Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\n\nThe DUP broke ranks and voted against Johnson's agreement on Saturday because it created new trade regulations for goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nA customs union would avoid that.\n\nThe Brexit-supporting DUP appeared open to the suggestion after rejecting another amendment backed by Labour that would put up any eventual deal for a confirmatory referendum.\n\nHundreds of thousands rallied in London on Saturday demanding a second national vote on Brexit that could overturn the 2016 EU referendum's results.", "description": "British legislators have refused to back PM's revised divorce deal until legislation needed to ratify it has passed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/21/0d1938deda6b4a5180c68c8b795159ae_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
