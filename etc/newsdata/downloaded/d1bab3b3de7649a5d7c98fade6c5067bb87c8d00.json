Anthony is the politics editor for Insider and Business Insider and a producer/co-conspirator for (what has apparently now become Political Beats\u2019 informal sister podcast) The Fifth Column. You can find him on Twitter at @ anthonyLfisher.\n\nAnthony\u2019s Music Pick: Elvis Costello\n\nThis week the gang covers the early adventures of Declan Patrick (Aloysius) MacManus, known to the world as Elvis Costello. All three of them are massive EC fans of long-standing, but they each have rather nuanced takes on this early period where he garnered his greatest critical (though not commercial, ironically enough) success. Behold, as Jeff claims the blowback from the Ray Charles Incident was justified \u201cinstant karma\u201d! Behold, as Scot perversely argues that Imperial Bedroom is overrated! Behold, as Anthony dismisses \u201cPump It Up\u201d! Behold, as all three of the gang wish the Attractions had played on My Aim Is True!\n\nIf you\u2019re already a fan of Elvis Costello, then not only do these references make sense to you, hey: you\u2019re already listening. If for some reason you\u2019re not, let us take the time to explain to you why Britain\u2019s most literate and craftsmanlike songwriter of the past 45 years combined with one of its most explosive backing bands to produce an album catalogue that no music-lover can afford to be ignorant of.
