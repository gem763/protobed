Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, a lifelong social democrat whose early political career was forged during his native Portugal's democratic revolution in 1974, opened the annual leaders' gathering with a fervent plea for greater international solidarity and cooperation \u2014 to fight climate change and economic inequality, to resist rising authoritarianism and halt rollbacks in democratic freedoms, to protect those who face discrimination and persecution, and above all to prevent war.\n\nGuterres concluded his speech by calling for a reaffirmation of the principles of multilateralism and international cooperation upon which the U.N. was founded in 1945.\n\n\"We are here to advance the common good while upholding our shared humanity and values,\" he said. \"That vision united the founders of our organization. At a time of division today, we must reconnect with that spirit. Let us restore trust, rebuild hope and move ahead, together.\"\n\nIn sharp contrast, U.S. President Donald Trump \u2014 a Republican by affiliation but often out of step with the party's historic ideological pillars, whose political career began only with his campaign for president following a career in real estate and reality TV \u2014 delivered a forceful defense of nationalism and individual state sovereignty, which also served as a denunciation of globalization and a warning against pluralist compromise that included blustery boasting about U.S. military supremacy.\n\n\"The future does not belong to globalists\" \u2014 Donald Trump, U.S. president\n\n\"The free world must embrace its national foundations,\" Trump said. \"It must not attempt to erase them or replace them. Looking around in all of this large magnificent planet, the truth is plain to see: If you want freedom, take pride in your country. If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty, and if you want peace, love your nation. Wise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country first.\n\n\"The future does not belong to globalists,\" Trump added, delivering perhaps the most memorable line of the day in the General Assembly, which is comprised of 193 member states. \"The future belongs to patriots. The future belongs to sovereign and independent nations, who protect their citizens, respect their neighbors and honor the differences which make each country special and unique.\"\n\nOpposing views\n\nGuterres and Trump have been circling each other, trading barbed (albeit indirect) attacks on each other's world view for months, if not years.\n\nWhile it's not clear that the American president gives the understated Portuguese secretary-general much thought, his actions \u2014 abandoning the Paris climate accords and the Iran nuclear deal, quitting the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and provoking a series of trade wars \u2014 have demonstrated Trump's scorn for the type of global cooperation that Guterres considers essential to the future of humankind.\n\nMeanwhile, it was more than obvious whom Guterres had in mind when he traveled to the summit of G7 economic powers in Biarritz, France last month and complained that the world's wealthiest nations are not doing enough to fight climate change.\n\nAnd it was more than clear whom Guterres was thinking of when he spoke on Tuesday of a dangerous new risk of great-power conflict.\n\n\"At this time of transition and dysfunction in global power relations, there is a new risk looming on the horizon that may not yet be large, but it is real,\" Guterres said. \"I fear the possibility of a great fracture: the world splitting in two, with the two largest economies on earth creating two separate and competing worlds, each with their own dominant currency, trade and financial rules, their own internet and artificial intelligence capacities, and their own zero sum geopolitical and military strategies.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We must do everything possible to avert the great fracture and maintain a universal system \u2014 a universal economy with universal respect for international law; a multipolar world with strong multilateral institutions.\"\n\nIn many ways, the secretary-general's remarks echoed comments by another American president, Harry Truman, speaking in San Francisco on the day in 1945 when global delegates completed work on the U.N. charter. In that speech, Truman made a fierce case for internationalism as the key to ending wars.\n\n\"Experience has shown how deeply the seeds of war are planted by economic rivalry and social injustice,\" Truman said. \"The charter recognizes this fact because it has provided for economic and social cooperation as well. It has provided for this cooperation as a part of the very heart of the entire compact. It has set up machinery of international cooperation which men and nations of goodwill can use to help correct economic and social causes for conflict.\"\n\nLike Truman, who was then weeks away from giving the order to drop atomic bombs on Japan, Trump addressed delegates of the U.N. with the possibility of a military strike very much on his mind \u2014 a potential attack on Iran that he has threatened on and off throughout his presidency. Trump opened his remarks on Tuesday with a declaration that the U.S. has never been stronger.\n\n\"The United States, after having spent over two and a half trillion dollars since my election to completely rebuild our great military, is also by far the world's most powerful nation,\" he said. \"Hopefully it will never have to use this power.\"\n\nOn the one hand, the number seemed unnecessarily exaggerated. The entire U.S. annual defense budget is a bit less than $700 billion. On the other hand, his professed reluctance to using force likely came as a surprise to leaders of Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Serbia, Panama and other nations in the General Assembly that have directly felt the impact of the U.S. military's long reach.\n\n\"I have the immense privilege of addressing you today as the elected leader of a nation that prizes liberty, independence and self-government above all,\" Trump said. \"That is why the United States rigorously defends the traditions and customs that have made us who we are.\"\n\nFor many leaders in the audience, however, serious doubts about the fundamental principles underpinning U.S. policy have only arisen since Trump took office. And much of their actions, especially among Washington's traditional European allies, now often seem aimed at appeasing Trump and coaxing him back into the Western fold.\n\nWhen U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday issued two separate statements, one reiterating Britain's commitment to the Iran nuclear deal and another declaring the deal deeply flawed and urging that Trump help negotiate a new one, officials quickly explained the discrepancy by saying it was partly intended to bring Trump back to the negotiating table with Tehran.\n\nWhen French President Emmanuel Macron decided to skip the custom of issuing leaders' conclusions at the G7 summit in Biarritz, it was a strategy designed specifically with the combustible American president in mind.\n\nDisrupters all around\n\nBut there was no mistaking just how disruptive and destructive Guterres believes Trump has been to the international order, delivering remarks in which actions by the U.S. president could easily be lumped together with those of authoritarian dictators. Are journalists the \"enemy of the people\" in Russia and China, or in America? Are environmentalists viewed as antagonists in Brasilia or Washington?\n\n\"We see wide-ranging impunity, including for violations of international humanitarian law,\" Guterres said in his speech. \"New forms of authoritarianism are flourishing. Civic space is narrowing. Environmental activists, human rights defenders, journalists and others are being targeted.\n\n\"At a time when record numbers of refugees and internally displaced people are on the move, solidarity is on the run,\" Guterres said at another point in his address. \"We see not only borders, but hearts, closing \u2014 as refugee families are torn apart and the right to seek asylum torn asunder.\"\n\nBy contrast, Trump, in his own speech, denounced \"open-border activists who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of social justice.\u201d\n\n\"We are here to advance the common good while upholding our shared humanity and values\" \u2014 Antonio Guterres, U.N. secretary-general\n\nBut it was not just Trump who embodied the disruption that Guterres decried in his speech. As the secretary-general fretted about new forms of authoritarianism, it was Johnson who made arrangements to leave New York early after the U.K. Supreme Court ruled that he had illegally suspended parliament.\n\nGuterres was applauded heartily. Trump's remarks did not draw laughter as he did last year when he asserted his presidency in two years had accomplished more than any other, nor did his speech draw much applause. Leaders were mostly silent. The U.S. commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, appeared to fall asleep.\n\nEven in their positivity, Guterres and Trump showed their differences.\n\n\"We are here to serve,\" Guterres said. \"We are here to advance the common good while upholding our shared humanity and values.\"\n\nTrump took another tack. \"Love of our own nations,\" he said, \"makes the world better for all nations.\"", "description": "The leaders of the United Nations and the United States offered opposing world views at the General Assembly on Tuesday.", "authors": ["David M.
