Bacow wrote to the university: \u201cThe consideration of race, alongside many other factors, helps us achieve our goal of creating a diverse student body that enriches the education of every student. Everyone admitted to Harvard College has something unique to offer our community, and today we reaffirm the importance of diversity \u2014 and everything it represents to the world.\u201d\n\nThe ruling was highly anticipated because the case was seen as a challenge not only to Harvard, but to all colleges and universities that take race into account when they build a class. The issue has roused passions among many Asian Americans who fear they are subject to hidden quotas at elite schools, similar to the roadblocks Jewish students often faced early in the 20th century. But others defend affirmative action as a matter of social justice, with profound educational benefits.\n\nAD\n\nThe ruling from the judge in Boston also comes at a time of national debate over race, class and access to higher education as a scandal over a cheating and bribery scam to help the children of rich parents get into prominent universities has shaken public confidence this year in the admission system.\n\nAD\n\nAround the world, Harvard is renowned for exclusivity. Of 43,330 who applied to enter as freshmen this fall, Harvard offered admission to 1,950, or 4.5 percent. That means roughly 19 of every 20 applicants were denied. The expected size of the class is about 1,660.\n\nOf those admitted, Harvard said, 25.4 percent identified as Asian American, 14.8 percent as African American and 12.4 percent as Latino. The Asian American share of admits has risen in recent years \u2014 a telltale sign, the plaintiff said, that Harvard had adjusted its practices under pressure from the lawsuit.\n\nAD\n\nThe university did not specify the white share of admissions for the Class of 2023, but federal data show a plurality of its undergraduates are white students from the United States. (About 12 percent of admitted students are international.)\n\nAD\n\nAt its heart, the case centered on whether Harvard discriminated against Asian American applicants, imposing a racial penalty on them in the review of their files and limiting their share in the admitted class to make room for other groups. Harvard denied all of those claims.\n\nThe ruling from Burroughs landed months after the trial\u2019s closing arguments and nearly five years after the case began.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions filed the lawsuit against Harvard in November 2014. Blum, a critic of race-based affirmative action who is white, helped organize legal challenges to the Voting Rights Act and the admissions process at the University of Texas at Austin. Among the group\u2019s members are Asian Americans who applied to Harvard and were denied admission. Their names and details about their applications have not been disclosed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Harvard admissions trial, alleged victims of racial bias remain anonymous\n\nThe suit alleged that Harvard intentionally discriminates against Asian American applicants \u201cbased on prejudicial and stereotypical assumptions about their qualifications.\u201d It also alleged that the university seeks to engineer the demographics of incoming classes to meet predetermined goals through \u201cracial balancing;\u201d that it gives too much weight to race in making admission decisions; and that it has failed to give adequate consideration to \u201crace-neutral\u201d alternatives for achieving diversity.\n\nThe judge rejected all four of those claims.\n\nIn denying the allegations, Harvard said it has followed decades of Supreme Court precedent that allow colleges to consider race and ethnicity, within limits, to reap the educational benefits of a racially diverse campus.\n\nAD\n\nIn June 2016, the high court narrowly upheld the constitutionality of race-conscious admissions at UT-Austin. Unlike the Harvard case, that suit identified a plaintiff who had been denied admission, a white woman named Abigail Fisher.\n\nAD\n\nThe 4-to-3 decision in Fisher v. University of Texas, authored by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, was a defeat for Blum and his allies. It preserved the status quo for affirmative action: Universities are allowed to consider race as one factor among many in a \u201cholistic\u201d review of an applicant\u2019s background and credentials. But they are not allowed to set racial targets or quotas, and they must review whether alternatives, such as geographic or socioeconomic preferences, would be workable and could accomplish the same goals.\n\nKennedy has since retired, and conservatives hope his replacement, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, will push the court in a new direction on affirmative action.\n\nAD\n\nThe Harvard case unearthed a trove of data on admissions to one of the world\u2019s most selective colleges. Burroughs ordered Harvard to provide the plaintiff with internal electronic records on more than 166,000 domestic applicants spanning six admission cycles through 2014-2015, as well as admission officer comments from hundreds of files. Analyses of that data and other documents, such as a guidebook for alumni interviewers, provided a rare public look inside the gate-keeping shop of a school where tens of thousands apply every year.\n\nAD\n\nNormally Harvard does not disclose how many children of alumni apply and what share are accepted. But court documents revealed that 4,644 \u201clegacy\u201d applicants from the United States applied during those six cycles, and 34 percent were admitted. Documents also showed that 1,374 applicants were identified as recruited athletes in that time, and 86 percent of them were admitted.\n\nDockets, ratings and \u2018tips\u2019: How Harvard admissions selects a student\n\nThe data the plaintiff obtained, stripped of names and other identifying information, included numeric ratings Harvard assigned to each applicant, from 1 (high) to 4 (low), on four dimensions: academic, extracurricular, personal and athletic. Also noted were gender, race and ethnicity, among other characteristics, and the decisions Harvard made.\n\nAD\n\nThe plaintiff hired a Duke University economist, Peter S. Arcidiacono, to analyze the data. He concluded in a report made public last year that Harvard imposes a \u201csignificant penalty\u201d on Asian American applicants relative to white students when it rates their personal qualities \u2014 such as leadership, grit, courage and kindness \u2014 and when it makes admission decisions. He also found that Asian Americans are less likely to be accepted in certain situations than white, African American and Hispanic applicants with similar profiles.\n\nAD\n\nBut Harvard hired its own expert, David Card, an economist from the University of California at Berkeley, who disputed Arcidiacono\u2019s findings. Card concluded that the \u201cpurported \u2018penalty against Asian Americans\u2019 \u201d does not exist. He contended that Arcidiacono had cherry-picked data to skew his results and focused too narrowly on academic achievement in an applicant pool brimming with candidates who boast perfect or near-perfect test scores and grades.\n\nWhat gives you an edge in Harvard admissions? Check the trial evidence\n\nThe dueling experts took the stand last fall in a three-week trial that dissected their statistical argument in numbing detail. Also testifying were Harvard\u2019s longtime dean of admissions, William R. Fitzsimmons, and several university officials, students, alumni and admission officers.\n\nHarvard acknowledged that some highly qualified applicants receive a plus, or \u201ctip,\u201d based on race or ethnicity that can lead to an offer of admission. It defended that practice as essential for campus diversity. If the university were forced to ignore race in admissions, Harvard said, the number of black and Latino students could drop substantially.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions pressed Harvard on whether it had ignored questions about potential bias against Asian Americans that surfaced through a 2013 internal university report. It also zeroed in on why admission officers tended to give Asian Americans lower marks for personal ratings than for academic and extracurricular achievement.\n\nInternal Harvard study suggested Asian Americans would benefit from \u2018academics-only\u2019 admissions\n\nAdam K. Mortara, an attorney for the plaintiff, charged that the discrepancies arose because the university failed to give the admission officers explicit instruction on how to consider race. Without such guidance, Mortara said during the trial, \u201cyou have let the wolf of racial bias in through the front door.\u201d\n\nWilliam F. Lee, an attorney for Harvard, countered that the real discrimination threat \u2014 \u201cthat wolf,\u201d as he called it \u2014 came from the plaintiff and others who would \u201cturn back the clock\u201d to undo progress on diversity.\n\nLee questioned why the plaintiff chose not to put any of its members on the witness stand or put their applications into the record of evidence. \u201cIf there was an application file after all of this that showed discrimination, wouldn\u2019t we have seen it?\u201d he asked during the trial.\n\nThere was no jury. Burroughs, a nominee of President Barack Obama, joined the federal bench in 2014 soon after the lawsuit was filed. During a pretrial hearing in January 2016, the judge revealed that she had once applied to Harvard and been rejected.\n\nAs an attorney discussed the large amount of information Harvard tracks on each applicant, Burroughs joked: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should be starting to feel better or worse about the fact that I didn\u2019t get into Harvard.\u201d Neither side in the case sought her recusal. Burroughs graduated from Middlebury College in 1983.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The decision hands the university a victory in a lawsuit that marked one of the latest chapters in the affirmative-action debate.", "authors": ["Nick Anderson", "Reporter Covering Higher Education", "National Education Policy", "The Global Education Market"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eaUwmP3JQOMlyUco544hq3G0Cgc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G4LEOFUSCQI6TKW3OTTLFNDPNI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
