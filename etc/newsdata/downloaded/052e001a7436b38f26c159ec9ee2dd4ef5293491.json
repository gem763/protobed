You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOne of those assistants, attack coach Scott Wisemantel, confirmed the decision on Friday. \u201cWe will watch that on telly. I think Eddie may head out, I am not sure.\n\n\u201cWe will go and watch Australia vs Wales on Sunday,\u201d he added. \u201cThe rest of the time we are working so we get to watch the games on television or a live feed. \u201c\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I\u2019ll watch other games,\u201d Jones said. I\u2019ll go and watch Australia vs Wales on Sunday.\u201d\n\nAddressing what he hopes to learn from watching Sundays Pool D match at the Tokyo Stadium, Wisemantel explained: \u201cYou look at the way teams attack and defend. I am looking for space. That is what I generally look for. I work in patterns. I try to identify where there is space and come up with ideas of how I might manipulate that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much of where the space is, but there is a trend in the tournament. We alluded to it before with defence and the other one is the accuracy of the kicking games. There is no surprise there. The better teams have better kick games and kick strategies.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that England are taking Argentina lightly, but with four consecutive wins over the Pumas in Jones\u2019s four years in charge at an average of 10 points more per game, England will start the match as favourites.\n\nArgentina will have a point to prove, not just because of that losing record to England but after their opening defeat against France, their hopes of reaching the quarter-finals will effectively be over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge challenge and they carry a lot of threats, and that reflects what they have done with their systems with the Jaguares in Super Rugby and also their Argentina B team which plays regularly as well,\u201d said Wisemantel. \u201cThey have a good system and play a lot of rugby. They have threats all across the park.\n\n\u201cYou have your spiritual leaders like Agustin Creevy, but you also have guys who can really open a game up like Emiliano Boffelli at full-back, a very good player. There is a lot of experience, Nicolas Sanchez knows who to move his team around the field, also Tomas Cubelli at half-back \u2013 they are a really good team.\u201d\n\nThat resonated within full-back Elliot Daly, who three years ago suffered the anguish of being sent off four minutes into England\u2019s autumn international against the Pumas.\n\n\"They are going to come out very passionate, they always are,\u201d said Daly. \u201cThey've got a good record in the World Cup as well so we'll be definitely wary of that.\n\n\"They've obviously got a very good forward pack but some good backs as well. We've played against them a couple of times in the last couple of years so we'll see if they are doing anything differently at the World Cup, but we'll be focusing on ourselves mostly just to try to get our game up to where we want it to be.\"", "description": "Eddie Jones and his coaching team snubbed\u00a0Saturday\u2019s match involving\u00a0England\u2019s next opponents, Argentina, in order to watch Sunday\u2019s clash between Wales\u00a0and Australia,\u00a0to fully scout\u00a0their potential quarter-final rivals.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/27/11/eddie-jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
