REUTERS/Jorge Cabrera\n\n\u201cNobody is above the law,\u201d Hernandez told a news conference in the Honduran capital. \u201cI\u2019ve never intervened, nor will I, to protect anybody - not friends, nor fellow party members, nor family members - absolutely nobody.\u201d\n\nThe trial of Hernandez\u2019s brother, Juan Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Hernandez, began on Wednesday in federal court in New York. The politician, arrested in Miami last year, faces charges of drug conspiracy and possessing illegal weapons.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyer has denied the charges.\n\nOn Thursday, jurors in the trial heard testimony from former drug trafficker Victor Hugo Diaz Morales, who said he gave $40,000 to Juan Orlando Hernandez\u2019s congressional campaign in 2005 at Tony Hernandez\u2019s request.\n\nDiaz, who is now in U.S. custody and cooperating with prosecutors, testified that he worked together with Tony Hernandez to traffic about 140,000 kilograms of cocaine to the United States from about 2004 to 2016. Some of that cocaine, Diaz said, came from a Colombian factory partly owned by Tony Hernandez, and was stamped with a \u201cTH\u201d logo.\n\nPresident Hernandez, who began his second term in January 2018 amid allegations of electoral fraud, has not been charged with a crime.\n\nHe said drug traffickers and former police and officials who had been targeted by his government are using his brother\u2019s trial to retaliate.\n\n\u201cThe trial against Juan Antonio will undoubtedly become a platform for these criminals to seek revenge,\u201d he said, adding he expected witnesses to provide unfounded statements that \u201cborder on the absurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll we need is for them to say at some point that they saw Pablo Escobar come back to life, and that he contributed to my campaign,\u201d Hernandez said, referring to the infamous Colombian drug lord who was killed in 1993.\n\nThe trial for his brother is unfolding as the Hernandez administration faces intense pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb migration to the United States.\n\nLast week, Trump stood side-by-side with President Hernandez in New York, giving a thumbs up, as the countries struck a deal under which Honduras would take in more asylum seekers.", "description": "Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said on Thursday he had never intervened to protect anybody, after his brother was accused of smuggling tons of cocaine into the United States for years under Hernandez's protection.", "authors": ["Gustavo Palencia", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436771229&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921P0"}
