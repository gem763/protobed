It\u2019s hard for me to even address this because I just wanna laugh and cry about it at the same time,\u2019 she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There is no \u2018old Jaclyn\u2019 and there is no \u2018new Jaclyn,\u2019 this is who I am. I know that you guys want that thin girl who was super peppy and loved life and was silly and joking all the time, and just did tutorials because she just loved it so much.\n\n\u2018But you guys, I am seriously that same girl inside. That\u2019s still who I am and I need that to be said.\u2019\n\nShe later proudly showed off her stretch marks on camera, revealing that she wants her fans to accept her for who she is.\n\n\u2018Honestly I\u2019m just over it. This is my body, this is where I\u2019m at, you guys need to accept it,\u2019 she added.\n\n\u2018You guys need to accept that I\u2019ve gained weight, and no I\u2019m not pregnant, no I\u2019m not trying to hide it from you.\u2019\n\nThe 29-year-old also said that right now, she is committed to her passion, which is makeup.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted, just to do makeup, to teach makeup, to create makeup.\n\n\u2018And I have failed at many of my attempts and it has been beyond humiliating, it\u2019s been awful, you have no idea how hard it\u2019s been for me personally. But that is my passion, that is my love.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
