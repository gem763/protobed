Myer shares are trading at 55.5\u00a2 but have recovered from lows of 36\u00a2 in February.\n\nMr Lew's representatives have dominated Myer's annual meetings for the last two years, questioning the chairman on performance and the strength of the balance sheet, but did not ask a single question at the meeting on Wednesday.\n\nMr Hounsell and Mr King said Myer had made good progress on its turnaround plan but there was much more to do to transform the business and deliver returns for shareholders.\n\n\"John and the team continue to be focused on delivery and execution, not promises; and we are getting on with the job of executing against the plan to improve the performance of the business and deliver shareholder value,\" Mr Hounsell said.\n\n\"This includes making progress on reducing excess space, improving merchandise range and service, and continuing to execute efficiencies leading to substantial cost savings.\"\n\n\"We have made good progress in executing the customer first plan, but we recognise there is much more to be done,\" he said.", "description": "Myer has avoided a third strike against its remuneration report after tweaking executive pay.\n.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8617%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_281%2C$y_2/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/174247e9e9f42cf75e69b9f8aa0011fc8bcd2481", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
