Of course! But only if you are liberal.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI reached out to the NCHSAA to find out why the cheerleaders were put on probation. I wanted them to show me the rule they allegedly violated. Their media relations team refused my request.\n\nSo why do I have a sneaking suspicion that had the kids been waving an anti-Trump banner the school district would\u2019ve turned a blind eye?\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY TODD STARNES", "description": "High school cheerleaders in North Carolina who posted a photo of themselves holding a pro-Trump banner were placed on probation.", "authors": ["Todd Starnes", "Todd Starnes Is Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/06/694940094001_6084170429001_6084169031001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
