Flooding left 48,000 homes without power for two days in Gloucestershire, 10,000 drivers were stranded on the M5 overnight and the RAF and Army were drafted in to help in Tewkesbury. Tewkesbury Abbey is surrounded by floodwater in July 2007 Also that year, thousands of people were rescued across Yorkshire and the Midlands, with other towns cut off and families forced to flee their homes. The town of Tewkesbury has also flooded more recently in November 2012 and December 2013. In 2012 Prime Minister David Cameron promised to take a 'tough approach' on negotiations with insurers over homes in flood danger as he insisted the Government was spending \u00a32billion on new defences in four years. Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire floods again in December 2013 Prince Charles visited Tewkesbury in 2007, saying: 'I've seen some obviously disastrous horrors that have affected so many people. What I have found so wonderful is the spirit the people have displayed.'\n\nDave Throup, Environment Agency manager for Herefordshire and Worcestershire yesterday said: 'It's very unusual for the River Severn to be at such high levels for its entire length, in England.\n\n'We've got flood warnings in place from the Welsh border to Gloucester. Most of our flood defences now deployed or being deployed, protecting hundreds of homes and businesses.'\n\nHe said the River Severn was at its highest level since February 2014. The Environment Agency also warned Tewkesbury residents to avoid low-lying footpaths near water courses and low-lying roads near rivers.\n\nThe Environment Agency said about 485 tonnes of water per second was passing through the river gauge at Buildwas, near Ironbridge, yesterday, with the river level up to 5.5m (18ft).\n\nRob Allen, who has been on holiday in the Gloucestershire village of Lydbrook since the weekend, said that water from the River Wye had affected his family holiday.\n\nOn Monday he said: 'We are on holiday down in the area and we knew that the river was rising overnight.\n\n'It has affected our access to the holiday home we are in. The family car has been flooded and all three cars are going to be written off. From where we are staying, it is a good 400 to 500ft from the river.\n\n'The local flood warden knocked on the door at tea-time yesterday and said there was a chance it would rise but I don't think he expected it to affect the vehicles in the way it did.'\n\nMr Allen said his family were forced to fetch some personal belongings from the cars using a canoe provided by the flood warden. He added: 'The house is fine but there is no access out of the house.\n\n'We needed to fetch some personal belongings from the car so the flood warden helped us and provided us with a boat. It has shocked the community around here. It has been worse or as bad as it has been for a number of years.'\n\nThis is while general manager Richard Wilson found himself knee-deep in water and said the situation has never been so bad.\n\nHe said: 'A water sports centre gets shut down because of too much water? It is so frustrating.'\n\nThe Environment Agency has issued 171 flood warnings (in red) or alerts (in orange), with the Midlands most affected\n\nA Land Rover is submerged in Lower Lydbrook in Gloucestershire on Monday after the village was flooded by rain and high tides\n\nFirefighters check vehicles as they wade through flood water from the River Wye at Lower Lydbrook on Monday afternoon\n\nSwans swim on the floodwater next to a rugby pitch in Worcester on Monday after rivers burst their banks in the area\n\nThe nearby Cuckmere Valley Canoe Club, which offers kayaking and canoeing, has also been affected as staff cannot access their equipment.\n\nYorkshire was also an area predicted to be affected by flooding.\n\nEmily Hood, 21, a student at York St John University, yesterday said: 'York is renowned for flooding but I've studied at York St John University for the last three years and I have never witnessed it risen this high before.\n\n'People have said it's been higher but I have never captured it on camera. In our area, many fields and roads were flooded due to the rainfall. It rained all of last week and then pretty much for 24 hours Friday and Saturday.\n\n'Luckily, it hasn't rained since Saturday so fingers crossed the river level starts to get lower.'\n\nNew Road Cricket Ground is left under several feet of water in Worcester after the UK was hit by widespread flooding today\n\nWorcester city is surrounded by flood water from the River Severn on Monday after rivers burst their banks following the heavy rain\n\nMembers of Gloucestershire Fire & Rescue Service use an inflatable raft as they wade through water in Lower Lydbrook on Monday\n\nA council 4x4 vehicle turns off onto higher ground through floodwater in Lower Lydbrook in Gloucestershire on Monday afternoon\n\nFlooded streets and the B4234 main road in Lower Lydbrook are pictured on Monday after major flooding in the area\n\nMet Office forecaster Craig Snell said the next couple of days are due to be mostly fine and dry, with sunny days but chilly nights.\n\nHe added: 'Thankfully the weather should give areas which have seen large amounts of rain the chance for it to drain away.\n\n'Going into Wednesday it is likely a further weather system will attempt to move in which could bring more heavy rain, particularly across South West England and Wales.'\n\nTorrential rain on Friday and Saturday caused mayhem across the country, with towns and villages deluged with floodwater.\n\nThe downpour saw the entire front of a house in Swansea's Ffynone area collapse, with all the rooms at the front of the property left visible and open to the elements, with rubble littering the area in front.\n\nThe flood forecast issued by the Environment Agency over the weekend said: ''Local ongoing flooding from the River Severn in the West Midlands is possible through to Tuesday. Land, roads and some individual properties will flood and there will be local travel disruption.'\n\nA police road closure sign is pictured in Lower Lydbrook today after rain from the Welsh hills and high tides flooded the village\n\nA postbox in a wall is submerged in water today in Lower Lydbrook, a village which sits next to the banks of the River Wye\n\nA dog runs through a frost covered field near Bracknell in Berkshire today after temperatures plunged overnight\n\nA man and his dog enjoy an early morning walk on Monday on Cothelstone Hill in the Quantock Hills in Somerset\n\nSunrise from the Malvern Hills in Worcestershire, where temperatures dipped on Monday and produced frost in parts of the UK", "description": "This morning commuters will be waking up to frost in the early hours, which is set to clear later on bringing some sunny spells, especially in south western parts of the country.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/01/20306862-0-image-a-8_1572311697900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
