But federal officials stressed they are still probing multiple possible causes of the mystery illness that sickened 200 people and claimed two lives.\n\nThe New York State Department of Health said it had received 34 reports of individuals between ages 15 and 34 who developed pulmonary illnesses after using at least one unregulated cannabis-containing vape product.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nState laboratory tests found high levels of vitamin E acetate \u2014 a common form of the vitamin \u2014 in nearly all of the samples, and at least one vitamin E-containing vape product was linked to each patient who submitted products for testing, the officials said.\n\nBut CDC Director Robert Redfield said it was \"probably important for us to keep an open mind that it may be a cause or may be causes,\" of the vaping illness outbreak. \"People need to realize that it is very probable that there are multiple causes.\"\n\nThe FDA also stressed this point. \"No one substance, including Vitamin E acetate, has been identified in all of the samples tested,\" the agency said in a news release. \"Importantly, identifying any compounds that are present in the samples will be one piece of the puzzle but will not necessarily answer questions about causality.\"\n\nNew York officials said the common nutritional supplement \u2014 which is not designed to be inhaled \u2014 is now the main focus of their investigation into vaping-associated pulmonary illnesses.\n\nPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Some had lipoid pneumonia, which is not caused by the vitamin, he said. Cannabis and other vegetable oils contain vitamin E.\n\nOther scientists have cautioned that many different components of vapes could cause serious lung disease.\n\nAn FDA spokesperson said the agency was analyzing 100 samples submitted by the states and was looking for the presence of a broad range of chemicals, including nicotine, THC and other cannabinoids, solvents, diluents, pesticides, opioids, poisons and toxins.\n\nIn a USA Today column, Redfield, Sharpless and HHS Secretary Alex Azar touted the agency's hard work on the outbreak and promised to fight youth nicotine addiction. \"Any opportunity for electronic cigarettes to serve as an off-ramp\" for addicted smokers \"must not come at the expense of children,\" they wrote.\n\nBut critics continued to accuse the federal government of failing to send a clear message to the public on what products to avoid. \"We know that it\u2019s important with health communication to deliver very clear messaging, unambiguous meaning,\" said the American Lung Association's Paul Billings. His group's advice, Billings said, is \"don\u2019t use these products.\"\n\nRedfield, who noted that CDC last week urged vapers to avoid street products, said officials were discussing a broader communication strategy. \"Clearly ... if you\u2019re a non-smoker don't start using these products. If you\u2019re pregnant don't use these products. These products have no role in adolescence.\" Current users who are \"concerned about your health\" should also stop \"until we get a better handle\" on the cause or causes.\n\nMichigan temporarily banned flavored vaping products on Wednesday, and several other states are considering action against the products, said Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\n\nStates have started to move against vaping products because of the \"real lack of progress from the federal government,\" said Billings.\n\nBrianna Ehley and Arthur Allen contributed to this report.\n\nThis article tagged under: E-Cigarette\n\nHealth Care", "description": "Federal officials including the head of the CDC cautioned against jumping to conclusions on the cause \u2014 or causes \u2014 of the outbreak.", "authors": ["Shannon Young", "Sarah Owermohle"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8b/a4/d397c2b64337bd5ed53f88546777/1995-vaping-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
