It's an extraordinary feeling,\" Zahra Pashaei, a 29-year-old nurse who has only known soccer games from television, told the Associated Press news agency. \"At least for me, 22 or 23 years of longing and regret lies behind this.\"\n\nFor nearly 40 years, Iran has barred female spectators from entering football and other sports stadiums, with clerics arguing women must be shielded from the masculine atmosphere and sight of semi-clad men.\n\nLast month, world football's governing body FIFA pressured Iran to allow women access to stadiums without restriction and in numbers determined by demand for tickets.\n\nThat came after the death of Sahar Khodayari, dubbed \"Blue Girl\" because of the colours of the football club she supported, who set herself ablaze last month outside a court after she found out that she could face a two-year jail sentence for attempting to enter a stadium dressed as a boy.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, FIFA feted the match as \"a very positive step forward\".\n\nFIFA has demanded that the authorities allow an unrestricted number of women to attend all games. But Tehran has yet to announce that they will be granted unrestricted access to all matches.\n\nIran won their World Cup qualifying match against Cambodia 14-0 but the one-sided game will be remembered much more for the scenes in the stands.", "description": "For nearly 40 years, female spectators have been banned from entering football and other sports stadiums in Iran.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/10/376ea349622f467789f4402b393c9be0_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
