Rodriguez via Getty Images Writer Adele Lim remains in demand -- she's the co-writer of \"Raya and the Last Dragon\" for Walt Disney Studios.\n\nCrazy Rich Asians\u201d co-writer Adele Lim has left the franchise.\n\nLim reportedly will not be involved in future projects stemming from the 2018 blockbuster due to a huge disparity in pay offered to the Malaysian-born screenwriter and white co-writer Peter Chiarelli, according to an exclusive report from the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe outlet reported that sources said industry veteran Chiarelli received starting offers from Warner Bros. ranging from $800,000 to $1 million while Lim was offered $110,000-plus.\n\n\u201cIf I couldn\u2019t get pay equity after CRA, I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like for anyone else, given that the standard for how much you\u2019re worth is having established quotes from previous movies, which women of color would never have been [hired for],\u201d Lim, who departed from the project last year, told the outlet. \u201cThere\u2019s no realistic way to achieve true equity that way.\u201d\n\nAccording to the article, Warner Bros.\u2032 rationalized the disparity, given that the industry has traditionally set ranges based on experience. Lim\u2019s first screenwriting credit was the 2018 rom-com hit. Chiarelli\u2019s credits include 2009\u2032s \u201cThe Proposal\u201d and 2016\u2032s \u201cNow You See Me 2.\u201d\n\nThe studio refused to deviate from the standard, and the decision was backed by chairman Toby Emmerich. Although Chiarelli offered to split his fee, prompting the studio to approach Lim with a more equal bid, Lim stood firm on her decision.\n\n\u201cPete has been nothing but incredibly gracious, but what I make shouldn\u2019t be dependent on the generosity of the white-guy writer,\u201d she told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nWhen it comes to pay equity in Hollywood, progress is slow and gaps persist. A Google document was circulated last year among TV assistants, writers and executives who were asked to provide their race, gender, and salary. The document revealed that though a woman of color producer earned $10,000 an episode for a show on The CW network, a white woman with the identical job made $14,000.\n\nThose in front of the camera have also pointed to significant discrepancies in pay between genders, as well as between actors of color and those who are white.\n\n\u201cNo one will say that a woman is getting paid less because she\u2019s a woman of color, but the numbers mostly end up reflecting that,\u201d Priyanka Chopra said in an InStyle interview last year.\n\nA Forbes magazine list of 2018\u2032s highest-paid actresses lacked any women of color makes the list. Taraji P. Henson revealed in her book \u201cAround the Way Girl: A Memoir\u201d that she was paid less than 2% of what Brad Pitt made for \u201cThe Curious Case Of Benjamin Button.\u201d Moreover, Henson had to pay for three months of hotel expenses out of her own pocket.", "description": "Lim was offered far less than co-writer Peter Chiarelli by Warner Bros.", "authors": ["Asian-American Affairs Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ffd5b2500005500035d29.jpeg?cache=mlechb1bwj&ops=1778_1000"}
