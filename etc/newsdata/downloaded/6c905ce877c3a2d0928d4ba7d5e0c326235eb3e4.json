Using technology provided by partner Aira, called \u201cFreePower,\u201d the new Nomad Base Station Pro will be able to charge up to three devices at once placed in any orientation on its surface \u2014 cool both because of the three-device simultaneous support and the fact that you don\u2019t have to make sure the gadget you\u2019re charging is lined up exactly right on the charger, as is typically the case.\n\nThis is pretty similar to what Apple\u2019s AirPower promised, before its unfortunate demise. The hardware similarly makes use of a matrix of multiple charging coils, which interlink to offer charging capabilities across the surface of the Base Station Pro. Perhaps intentionally, Aira\u2019s website URL is \u201cairapower.com,\u201d one letter off from Apple\u2019s shelved first-party accessory.\n\nNomad\u2019s charger inherits the same aesthetics of the company\u2019s existing chargers, which means you get a black soft leather surface for putting your devices on top of, and the surrounding frame is made of slate-gray aluminum. The charger should look and feel very premium, if Nomad\u2019s other Base Stations are any indication.\n\nThe Base Station Pro supports charging speeds of up to 5W each, which is not the max supported by the iPhone or other devices \u2014 but according to Aira co-founder Jake Slatnick, that\u2019s not actually much of a limitation at all.\n\n\u201cAn interesting detail that we\u2019ve learned through benchmarking is that our 5W output charge time is comparable to other 10W advertised chargers,\u201d Slatnick explained via email. \u201cIt turns out, as soon as the phone starts to heat up, the charge speed slows down significantly, usually below 5W. The 7.5W+ chargers seem to only last at those speeds for a few minutes. We think the performance right now is on par with everything else and that it shouldn\u2019t be noticeable to most users.\u201d\n\nThe Nomad Base Station Pro supports up to three devices, all at 5W; you could use it to charge say, two iPhones and AirPods with Apple\u2019s wireless charging case all at once.\n\nNomad also includes a 27W USB-C charger with Power Delivery in the box with the Base Station Pro, and a USB-C cable to connect to the charger. This probably will be a fairly premium-priced piece of hardware, but we\u2019ll find out for sure when pre-orders begin in November.\n\nThe one significant way this differs from what Apple was building, at least for Apple fans, is that it doesn\u2019t provide charging for the Apple Watch. Nomad has a Base Station model that offers an integrated Apple Watch charger, but of course with that you\u2019re not getting the \u201cplace anywhere\u201d overlapping coil design built for this new model.", "description": "Accessory maker Nomad already offers a couple of excellent wireless chargers that work great with Apple and other Qi-compatible devices, but they\u2019re introducing a new one that could be their most versatile yet.
