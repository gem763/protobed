He said he \u201cregretted\u201d the departure of Marie Yovanovitch, whom Mr. Trump this spring ousted as ambassador to Ukraine after Mr. Giuliani raised concerns about her. Mr. Sondland described her as an \u201cexcellent diplomat\u201d and a \u201cdelight to work with.\u201d\n\n\u201cInviting a foreign government to undertake investigations for the purpose of influencing an upcoming U.S. election would be wrong. Withholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong,\u201d Mr. Sondland said in his prepared testimony. \u201cI did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings. In my opinion, security aid to Ukraine was in our vital national interest and should not have been delayed for any reason.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
