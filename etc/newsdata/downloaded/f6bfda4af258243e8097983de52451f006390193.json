REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo\n\nA centre-right politician who grew up in Bulgaria under Communism, Georgieva built a reputation during her time at the World Bank and the European Commission as a tenacious straight shooter, champion of gender equality and leader in the global fight against climate change.\n\nGeorgieva, on a leave of absence from her post as chief executive officer of the World Bank during the IMF nomination process, told reporters she was in high gear with her \u201csleeves rolled, ready to work\u201d when she starts the job on Tuesday.\n\nShe will face a host of challenges as the head of the IMF, including a global economic slowdown triggered by escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, and historically high debt levels.\n\n\u201cWarning signs are flashing, and we must be ready to be tested,\u201d Georgieva, 66, told reporters at the bank\u2019s Washington headquarters after her confirmation.\n\nThe United States, which represents the largest voting bloc on the IMF board, has withdrawn from multilateral accords, and risks are growing in emerging markets like Argentina, which last year received a $57 billion bailout, the IMF\u2019s largest ever.\n\nGeorgieva said her priority would be to help the bank\u2019s 189 member countries minimize risks. The bank would aim to be attentive to all members, big or small, she added.\n\nGeorgieva, backed by French President Emmanuel Macron, won support last month from the rest of the European Union, as well as tacit backing from the United States.\n\nIn her new role, she will need to \u201cwork on rebuilding the institution\u2019s legitimacy among emerging market economies,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor who is the former head of the bank\u2019s China department.\n\nThe world\u2019s \u201cmajor advanced economies continue to view the key international financial institutions as their fiefdoms,\u201d he said.\n\nAn IMF board source told Reuters before Wednesday\u2019s confirmation that Georgieva was ready for the job. \u201cShe has convinced the board that she is the leader that the institution needs and will be a strong advocate for the multilateral system,\u201d the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the board\u2019s deliberations are not public.\n\n\u2018HUGE ACHIEVEMENT FOR BULGARIA\u2019\n\nGeorgieva\u2019s nomination has sparked great pride in her home country, which had an IMF rescue programme just two decades ago.\n\nBulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov congratulated Georgieva in a posting on Facebook: \u201cThis is a huge achievement for Bulgaria. I am convinced she will deal wonderfully with the management of one of the world\u2019s largest institutions.\u201d\n\nGeorgieva replaces Christine Lagarde, who became the first woman to head the IMF when she took the helm in 2011. Lagarde, 63, guided the lender through the European sovereign debt crisis, which began about a month after she took office. She is departing to head the European Central Bank.\n\nBefore her appointment at the World Bank, Georgieva held numerous senior European Commission posts, including budget commissioner. On Wednesday, she underscored the fund\u2019s role in building stronger economies and dealing with challenges such as inequality, climate risks and rapid technological change.\n\nScott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said Georgieva quickly made an impact after assuming the No. 2 role at the World Bank in early 2017. She pushed for consensus on a $13 billion capital increase and reform package agreed to last year. Under the reforms, lending to China and other wealthier developing countries will decrease, with more resources going to needier countries.\n\n\u201cShe was able to bring together a diverse group of shareholders. That\u2019s her strength,\u201d said Morris, a former U.S. Treasury official. \u201cWhat\u2019s less clear is how she will handle the day-to-day business of the fund, that business being the crisis moments. It\u2019s harder to see how she will respond in a crisis.\u201d\n\nMorris said Lagarde was successful in that she was not viewed as representing European interests, which helped her navigate the Greek debt crisis. Georgieva will have to take a similar multilateral approach, keeping her focus on the interests of the institution and individual countries.\n\n\u201cNo one thought of Lagarde as a European chief executive,\u201d Morris said. \u201cShe rose above that.\u201d", "description": "Bulgarian economist Kristalina Georgieva was confirmed on Wednesday as managing director of the International Monetary Fund, the first person from an emerging-market economy to head the world's crisis lender with its $1 trillion in resources.", "authors": ["Andrea Shalal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433607619&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O06T", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
