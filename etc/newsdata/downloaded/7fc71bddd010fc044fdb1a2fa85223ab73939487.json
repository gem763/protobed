It needs to analyse data from an estimated 2 400 counting sessions by teams of volunteers from 14 Dec to 5 Jan. The countings took place in North, Central and South America, the Caribbean and some South Pacific islands.\n\nAs of Wednesday, with just a fifth of the counting sessions totalled, there were 303 of the enormous white birds sighted, Geoff LeBaron, the project leader, said on Wednesday.\n\nLast year's final tally was 1 117 snowy owls, or nearly double the previous high of 563 from the 2011 count, he said.\n\n\"This is a big flight,\" LeBaron said, noting the birds' epicentre seems to be southern Ontario, the Great Lakes and the US Northeast.\n\nIt may be the fourth year in a row with a high number of snowy owls, he said. \"It probably won't quite reach the level of the one last season or in 2011. But you never know.\"\n\nSnowy owls breed in the Arctic, where they eat lemmings along with the occasional rabbit, rodent, fish and even fellow birds. Because they typically travel only in search of food, they are rarely seen outside the Arctic, LeBaron said.\n\n\"They don't usually come down this far. When they do, it's a real treat,\" LeBaron said.\n\nBird experts are not certain why the sightings are more numerous or if they are connected to climate change, LeBaron said.\n\n\"People just adore them,\" he said, adding their popularity among amateur photographers sometimes poses a threat to the animals.\n\n\"When people harass them, it's to the detriment of the birds. It can cause them to spend more energy and push them over the edge. If they are starving already, it can cause them to starve to death,\" LeBaron said.\n\nThe birds' natural habitats also can take a beating from crazed fans intent on getting a close-up - especially when they trample fragile dunes like those in New Jersey's Island Beach State Park, where snowy owls have been sighted.\n\nWildlife officials issued a Facebook plea for bird lovers to stay off the Jersey Shore dunes, located about 129km southeast of New York City.\n\n\"There were no arrests but we just had to ward off some people. Everyone with a cell phone camera wanted to come down to see the snowy owls,\" said Larry Ragonese, spokesperson for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.", "description": "The elusive snowy owl, rarely seen outside the Arctic, is turning up more frequently in the skies of North America than it does in the pages of a Harry Potter book.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2952/4dc47de194ed4dd6955fda4b26ceaf6a.jpg", "published_at": "2015-01-08"}
