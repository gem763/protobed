Many may not vote at all.\n\nIn 2015, when Mr. Trudeau was first elected, there was plenty of enthusiasm for his party, said Jon H. Pammett, a professor of political science at Carleton University. \u201cThis time there is not a lot of enthusiasm for any of the parties or any of the leaders,\u201d he said.\n\nThe likely effect, Professor Pammett said, is that many people simply may not vote.\n\nIf voter turnout is low, that could hurt Mr. Trudeau. And if neither his Liberals nor the Conservatives can win a majority of seats in the House of Commons, the smaller parties may end up in a powerful position even if they do not gain many seats themselves.", "description": "As Canada\u2019s election campaign heads into its final week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is locked in a tie with his Conservative challengers.
