Johnson indicated he would try again, saying an election was the only way forward for the country, and accusing opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn of being afraid of the public\u2019s judgment.\n\n\u201cThe obvious conclusion, I\u2019m afraid, is that he does not think he will win,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nScarcely six weeks after taking office with a vow to break Britain\u2019s Brexit deadlock \u2014 which entrapped and finally defeated his predecessor, Theresa May \u2014 Johnson\u2019s own plans to lead the U.K. out of the EU are in crisis.\n\nJohnson insists Britain must leave the bloc on the scheduled date of Oct. 31, with or without a divorce deal, but many lawmakers \u2014 including several from Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party \u2014 are determined to thwart him. On Wednesday the House of Commons approved an opposition bill designed to halt a no-deal Brexit.\n\nJohnson accused the opposition of trying to \u201coverturn the biggest democratic vote in our history,\u201d referring to the outcome of the 2016 referendum to leave the EU.\n\nHis solution, a risky one, is an election that could shake up Parliament and produce a less obstructive crop of lawmakers. But opinion polls do not point to a certain majority for Johnson\u2019s Conservatives, and on Wednesday Johnson did not get the general election he craves \u2014 at least not yet. Opposition parties, deeply mistrustful of the prime minister, refused to back a new election until the anti-no deal bill becomes law.\n\n\u201cLet the bill pass and have Royal Assent and then we can have a general election,\u201d Corbyn said.\n\nJohnson needed the support of two-thirds of the 650 lawmakers in the House of Commons to trigger an election \u2014 a total of 434 \u2014 but got just 298, with 56 voting no and the rest abstaining.\n\nJohnson signaled that he would try again to trigger a snap election, urging opposition lawmakers to \u201creflect overnight and in the course of the next few days.\u201d\n\nThe maneuvers are part of a head-on showdown between Johnson\u2019s Brexit-at-all-costs administration and a Parliament worried about the economic and social damage that could be wrought by a messy divorce.\n\nOpposition lawmakers, supported by rebels in Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party, warn that crashing out of the bloc without a divorce agreement would cause irreparable economic harm.\n\nIn a second straight day of parliamentary turmoil, the House of Commons voted by 327-299 in favor of an opposition bill to block a no-deal Brexit, sending it to Parliament\u2019s upper chamber, the House of Lords. Even so, the bill\u2019s fate is unsure. With Johnson set to suspend Parliament for several weeks starting next week, pro-Brexit peers in the Lords are threatening to try to stop it by filibustering until time runs out.\n\n\u201cThere is very little time left,\u201d said Labour Party lawmaker Hilary Benn as he introduced the opposition bill. \u201cThe purpose of the bill is very simple: to ensure that the United Kingdom does not leave the European Union on the 31st of October without an agreement.\u201d\n\nThe bill would require the government to ask the EU to delay Brexit until Jan. 31, 2020, if it can\u2019t secure a deal with the bloc by late October.\n\nThe lawmakers hope to pass the bill into law \u2014 a process that can take months \u2014 by the end of the week, because Johnson plans to suspend Parliament at some point next week until Oct. 14.\n\nJohnson became prime minister in July by promising to lead Britain out of the EU, breaking the impasse that has paralyzed the country\u2019s politics since voters decided in June 2016 to leave the bloc. But he is caught between the EU, which refuses to renegotiate the deal it stuck with May, and a majority of British lawmakers opposed to leaving without an agreement. Most economists say a no-deal Brexit would cause severe economic disruption and plunge the U.K. into recession.\n\nJohnson insisted Wednesday that talks with the EU on a revised deal were \u201cmaking substantial progress.\u201d\n\nBut the bloc says the U.K. has not submitted any substantial new proposals. European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said \u201cthere is nothing new\u201d from London.\n\nJohnson, who was a leader of the 2016 campaign to leave the EU, has long said that his enthusiasm and energy for Brexit will allow him to succeed in leaving the EU where May had failed, leading to her resignation.\n\nBut events have spiraled out of his control. He leads a government with no majority in Parliament and may not be able to secure an election that could change that fact.\n\nHe was humiliated Tuesday \u2014 the first day of Parliament\u2019s autumn term \u2014 by losing his first Commons vote as prime minister when lawmakers passed a motion 328-301 that enabled their push for a law stopping a no-deal Brexit. His government lost its working majority as one Conservative lawmaker defected to the opposition, and more than 20 Tory legislators sided with the opposition on the vote.\n\n\u201cNot a good start, Boris!\u201d one unidentified lawmaker shouted after the vote.\n\nJohnson responded with swift vengeance, expelling the rebels from the Conservatives in Parliament, leaving them as independent lawmakers. Among those bounced out were former International Development Secretary Rory Stewart; Kenneth Clarke, a former treasury chief and the longest-serving member of the House of Commons; and Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Johnson hero Winston Churchill.\n\nSoames came close to tears as he told the House of Commons that he had been proud to serve as a Conservative lawmaker for 37 years.\n\n\u201cI am truly very sad that it should end in this way,\u201d he said.\n\nThe beleaguered U.K. leader got a boost Wednesday when a Scottish court refused to intervene in his decision to suspend Parliament, ruling it was a matter for lawmakers to decide, not the courts.\n\nThe case was only the first of several challenges to Johnson\u2019s maneuver, however.\n\nTransparency campaigner Gina Miller, who won a ruling in the Supreme Court in 2017 that stopped the government from triggering the countdown to Brexit without a vote in Parliament, has another legal challenge in the works \u2014 set to be heard Thursday. A human rights campaigner has sued in Northern Ireland, arguing that the historic Good Friday peace accord is in jeopardy because of Johnson\u2019s actions.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson called Wednesday for a national election on Oct. 15, saying it was the only way out of Britain\u2019s Brexit impasse after lawmakers...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ715_boris0_ZG_20190904192944.jpg"}
