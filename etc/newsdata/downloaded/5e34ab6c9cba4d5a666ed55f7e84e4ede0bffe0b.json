It is \u201cthe end of the \u2018central bank put\u2019.\u201d\n\nMares\u2019s perspective is of a senior ECB insider now on the outside. The Frenchman spent five years as a special advisor to president Mario Draghi before joining Citi in 2017.\n\nIf rates below zero are making monetary policy counterproductive, why cut further below zero?\n\nNo surprise that Mares says September's decision was \"entirely FX driven\". The ECB knew the US Federal Reserve was about to cut and that this could push the euro higher at an awful time for the union. The ECB needed to show they could and would push rates lower in order to remain competitive in the global currency wars.\n\nIn other words, the 0.1 percentage point cut was designed to send a message to currency traders that rates could go lower.\n\nDraghi knows interest rate policy is no longer effective in stimulating demand and has, in fact, become counterproductive. So what does he do? He also announces he will reinstate a \u20ac20 billion a month asset purchase program, with no specified end date.\n\nMares argues that the purpose of restarting QE - a controversial decision which Mares says he fully supports - is not to make financing costs as cheap as possible for businesses, which are reticent to invest in an era of negligible demand and high uncertainty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, in the United Kingdom the uncertainty created by Brexit \u201cwill remain so large that effectively there is nothing the Bank of England can do to stimulate investment,\u201d Mares says.\n\nInstead, the restart of QE in Europe should be seen as paving the way for the next wave of stimulus: fiscal policy.\n\nCentral banks \"need to take control of the cost of funding for governments and that is exactly what the ECB can do,\" Mares explains. By committing to relatively small but open-ended purchases of government paper, the ECB suppresses volatility in rates markets and creates the space for fiscal policy.\n\nEffectively Draghi is saying to politicians, \"Your funding will be virtually zero for the foreseeable future and whatever the circumstances - over to you\".\n\nThat is why Mares believes this is \u201cthe end of the era of the almighty central banker\u201d. They have largely done their dash and now the best they can do is provide the conditions for governments to borrow and spend.\n\n\"I think ECB will do nothing at all\" from here, Mares says. Rates and asset purchases will remain where they are now for years to come.", "description": "A former special advisor to ECB boss Mario Draghi explains why monetary policy has lost traction and yet central bankers keep easing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1751%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_36/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e1a819c4b0233dd0086498c79144f515c37bbabb", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
