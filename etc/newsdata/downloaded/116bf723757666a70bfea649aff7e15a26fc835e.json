Would love to know what it's been feeding on!\"\n\n\"This is the biggest python I've rescued,\" he said, accompanying the post with a big smiling emoji.\n\nEvans, the owner of KZN Amphibian and Reptile Conservation, made the catch in Waterfall, Durban, on Sunday.\n\nA couple had called Evans after noticing the huge reptile next to a busy road on someone's property. The couple also told Evans that the snake had tried to slither into their driveway.\n\n\"The snake is not venomous. As I struggled with it, trying to carry it out of the bushes [on the property] it wrapped its head around my neck, so by the time I carried it out, I was a bit light-headed,\" Evans said with a chuckle.\n\nHe added it was one of the healthiest pythons he had seen.\n\nLast week, Evans was called by a KwaZulu-Natal family who had spent two weeks trying to drive two black mambas out of hiding in the back room of their Inanda home.\n\nFootage recorded on his GoPro showed small animals running along the walls as he caught the first snake.\n\nEvans said the harmless scorpions were not a threat and he was eventually able to capture a 2.3m female and 1.9m male.", "description": "This is the biggest python I have rescued, said the owner of KwaZulu-Natal Amphibian and Reptile Conservation, Nick Evans", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9201/241475b2c0674e17b4f28b0ae1b421f4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-07"}
