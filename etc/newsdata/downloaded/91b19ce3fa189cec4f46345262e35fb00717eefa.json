The larger 777-9, due to enter service first with a shorter range, has faced engine-related delays.\n\n\"Our timetable on the 777-8 obviously is still under consideration for when it actually enters service,\" Darren Hulst, a senior marketing executive at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told reporters in a telephone briefing from Sydney on Wednesday.\n\n\"But it is really more of when (we have) the combination of the demand from our customers and how it aligns with the design and production for the 777X as a program.\"\n\nHe declined to comment on whether an order from Qantas would accelerate Boeing's plans for the 777-8. To date, Emirates and Qatar Airways are Boeing's only customers for the plane, having ordered 35 and 10 respectively.\n\nEmirates President Tim Clark has said some 777X orders could be switched to 787s. Emirates and Qatar Airways did not respond to previous requests for comment on their 777-8 orders.\n\nBoeing has put forward a \"compelling offer\" to deal with any delays to the 777-8 in its contest against Airbus for planes for Sydney-London flights, Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said in August, without providing further details.\n\nThe Australian and International Pilots Association, which represents Qantas pilots, said on Wednesday it would help gather data on fatigue on three planned research flights, starting with the New York-Sydney journey on Friday. A London-Sydney flight is planned next month.\n\nThe union cautioned the flights would not replicate real-world conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jamie Freed; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Stephen Coates)", "description": "The date of entry into service of Boeing Co's ultra-long-range 777-8 wide-body airliner will depend partly on customer demand, an executive said, with the planemaker hoping to win an order from Qantas Airways Ltd to supply the plane for Sydney-London flights.
