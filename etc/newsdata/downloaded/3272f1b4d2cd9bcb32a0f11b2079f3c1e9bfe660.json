We'll Hold You In Contempt Of Congress", "language": "en", "text": "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) threatened to hold former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in contempt of Congress because of his \"refusal to answer questions\" relating to the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.\n\n\"Mr. Lewandowski, your behavior in this hearing room has been completely unacceptable. It is part of a pattern of a White House desperate for the American people not to hear the truth,\" Nadler said. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked several times today whether the Committee will hold you in contempt. It is certainly under consideration.\"\n\n\"There is a far more troubling level of contempt on display here today and that is President Trump's role in your refusal to answer questions. The pattern of obstruction laid out in the Mueller report has not stopped,\" Nadler explained. \"You showed the American people in real time that the Trump administration will do anything and everything in its power to obstruct the work of the Congress. The president's lawyers are sitting behind you right now to make sure that you do not answer us.\"\n\nAccording to Nadler, Congress is focused on exposing \"corruption, obstruction and abuse of power.\"\n\n\"Make no mistake, we will hold President Trump accountable,\" Nadler concluded.\n\nLewandowski refused to answer questions relating to previous conversations with President Trump. He cited executive privilege as his reason for not providing insight.\n\nFrom The Hill:\n\nThe remarks came after Democrats tussled for more than five hours with Lewandowski over his involvement in a possible obstruction episode as laid out in special counsel Robert Mueller's report. In particular, they sought to have the longtime Trump ally answer questions about Trump asking Lewandowski to pass along a message to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions in 2017 that urged him to reverse his recusal and set limits on the Russia probe. Lewandowski ultimately turned to then-White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver the letter. Dearborn did not ultimately follow through, telling investigators that the request made him uncomfortable.", "description": "Here we go..09/17/2019 19:21:34PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/141/53311838-b6e0-42ed-8754-c2b6ee7f6122.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
