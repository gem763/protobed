REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWhile Trump has questioned the value of the United Nations and scorned the importance of multilateralism as he focuses on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, he will return for a third time to push religious freedom on Monday, address the General Assembly on Tuesday and discuss Venezuela on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cObviously our overarching concern with Iran\u2019s escalatory violence is going to be a theme,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cWe welcome opportunities to discuss collective response.\u201d\n\nThe United States and its ally Saudi Arabia blame Iran for an attack last Saturday on the world\u2019s biggest crude oil processing facility and have said they will present evidence to back that up. Iran denies involvement in the attack. Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group, which has been fighting a Saudi-led military coalition since 2015, has claimed responsibility.\n\nTrump has said he is considering how to respond and that military action is an option. The United States on Friday imposed another round of sanctions on Tehran.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani is due to address the United Nations on Wednesday.\n\nLast week Trump flirted with meeting Rouhani, but has since backed away from the idea. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Iran would never hold such one-on-one talks but could engage in multilateral discussions if Washington returns to a 2015 nuclear pact.\n\nTrump will meet at least a dozen leaders during his three days in New York.\n\nXINJIANG\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has made climate action his priority with a summit dedicated to tackling the crisis on Monday. But Trump is skeptical of global warming and he and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will host an event at the same time on religious freedom.\n\nWhile it is not clear if Trump or Pence will make reference to any specific situations, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan will host a separate event on Tuesday on the \u201chuman rights crisis in Xinjiang\u201d in China, diplomats said.\n\nThe United Nations says at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained in Xinjiang. Beijing describes complexes in Xinjiang as \u201cvocational training centers\u201d helping to stamp out extremism and give people new skills.\n\n\u201cWe know that some country is trying to make a fuss on issues relating to China, including the situation in Xinjiang,\u201d China\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said on Friday.\n\n\u201cIf they simply want to make the issue a political issue, definitely we have every right to defend ourselves and we are completely opposed to any such interference in China\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d Zhang said.\n\n\u2018TRUST DEFICIT\u2019\n\nTrump drew gasps during his first speech to the 193-member United Nations in 2017 with a threat to wipe out North Korea and then laughter last year with a boast about the achievements of his administration.\n\nThough not specifically addressing Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday, the administration official said he would \u201caffirm America\u2019s leadership role in the rules-based international system, and the need to work collectively within the global community to address global challenges.\u201d\n\nTrump would also assert \u201cAmerica\u2019s determination to uphold the sovereignty and independence of member states especially on issues of national security,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe message is being delivered at a time when some diplomats say U.S. leadership in global institutions is waning and China\u2019s influence is growing. Since Trump took office, he has quit the U.N. Human Rights Council, the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, a global accord to tackle climate change, the Iran nuclear deal and opposed a U.N. migration pact.\n\n\u201cWe do think the United States will \u2013 in one way or another \u2013 come back to the right track because they will realize ... going back to multilateralism, going back to international cooperation does serve the fundamental interest of the United States,\u201d China\u2019s U.N. envoy Zhang said on Friday.\n\nHe told reporters the United Nations was at a crossroads and that the \u201cbiggest challenge facing the world is a deficit of trust, especially a deficit among major players.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese government\u2019s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, is due to address the United Nations next week, when more than 135 presidents and prime ministers and dozens of ministers were expected to attend the 74th U.N. General Assembly.\n\nA senior U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Friday: \u201cEven though everyone says that multilateralism is dead, multilateralism isn\u2019t very popular these days, countries are becoming more and more isolationist \u2013 everybody comes.\u201d", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump will tout U.S. leadership and a collective approach to challenges while at the United Nations next week, said a senior administration official on Friday, as Washington seeks to use the gathering of world leaders to build support to take on Iran and call out China over rights abuses.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432150662&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J2BX", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
