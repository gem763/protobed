The British currency is shown against the dollar over the past half-year in this graphic, and is currently around the $1.28 mark\n\nBut analysts say the fraught nature of the talks could bring further wild swings to as low as $1.10 or as high as $1.40, depending on whether an agreement can be found.\n\nHopes of a breakthrough lifted markets yesterday, but investors turned more cautious today after looking for a deal during the night that never came.\n\nBerenberg economist Kallum Pickering said: 'Most of the good news that could have been anticipated has been priced in, and now there's caution it seems on whether we get a deal today or not.'\n\nInvestors are now trading volatility levels not seen since the Brexit referendum in July 2016, with the pound having risen by 5 per cent over the past week.\n\nFiona Cincotta, an analyst at City Index, added: 'Traders will remain glued to headlines, which are the exclusive driver of the pound right now.'\n\nToday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's hopes of honouring his 'do or die' vow to deliver Brexit by Halloween looked to be fading as talks stalled in Brussels.\n\nThis graph shows how the pound has been rising against the dollar over the past week\n\nUK and EU negotiators reconvened this morning after working late into the night - getting tantalisingly close to the legal text of a settlement.\n\nBut Irish PM Leo Varadkar warned there are still 'many issues' still to be solved, hinting that an emergency summit might be needed in around a fortnight's time.\n\nDowning Street is also frantically dampening down expectations, saying the mood is 'downbeat' and there are 'still hurdles to overcome'.\n\nA deadlock would mean Mr Johnson will be caught by a Remainer law ordering him to beg for an extension beyond October 31.\n\nBoris Johnson's hopes of honouring his 'do or die' vow to deliver Brexit by Halloween look to be fading as talks stall in Brussels. The Prime Minister is pictured at 10 Downing Street yesterday\n\nMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: 'How many times have we been down this road in the last three years, as talks have faltered over the Gordian knot of Northern Ireland?\n\n'Not only does any deal have to pass muster with the EU, it also has to get past Northern Ireland's (Democratic Unionist Party), as well as MPs in the House of Commons.'\n\nEarlier, Brexit hopes provided some support to equity markets in Asia today, with Tokyo and Sydney more than 1 per cent higher while Singapore added 0.9 per cent.\n\nThere were strong gains in Seoul, Mumbai, Taipei and Wellington. A rally on Wall Street helped buying sentiment following a strong start to the US earnings season.", "description": "Signs of a breakthrough yesterday saw sterling rally to $1.28 in London as it climbed to its highest level in five months ahead of the looming deadline on October 31`, but the gains have halted today.", "authors": ["Mark Duell", "James Tapsfield For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/11/19782020-0-image-a-152_1571220649217.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
