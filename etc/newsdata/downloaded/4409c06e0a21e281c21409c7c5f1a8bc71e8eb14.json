I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be much tougher handling it this week than it was last week.\n\n\u201cBut as a flyhalf, you just let the boys go, you just keep going forward. It\u2019s my responsibility to keep our big boys going forward for the majority of the game.\u201d\n\nThe rain teeming down throughout South Africa\u2019s training session at the stadium on Friday only added to the likelihood of a tight, forward-dominated contest, but Pollard said it would have little impact on their game plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big set-piece battle, gainline battle, whether it\u2019s dry or wet, so we\u2019re prepared for that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhatever comes our way we\u2019ll deal with that, but our game works well if it\u2019s dry or wet.\u201d\n\nPollard said he is convinced the match will come down to a single kick at goal, which means the withdrawal of Wales fullback Liam Williams is not necessarily good news for South Africa.\n\nThe injury to Williams means Leigh Halfpenny will wear the red number 15 jersey on Sunday, bringing with him the feet that have kicked 188 penalties and 73 conversions in 88 tests, complementing the equally reliable kicking of Wales flyhalf Dan Biggar.\n\nPollard, who has had a success rate of 75% with his kicks for points at the tournament so far, said it does not make a huge difference to him who is kicking for Wales.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a world class goalkicker, we all know that much,\u201d Pollard said of Halfpenny.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on the day, we all know it\u2019s going to come down to a kick or a drop goal. It\u2019s semi-final rugby, you\u2019ve got to try to be on target every time you kick.\u201d", "description": "The Springboks came in for some flak back home for the limited ambition of their game against Japan last weekend but flyhalf Handre Pollard suggested on Friday that there would be little change for the World Cup semi-final against Wales.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444782054&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0GB-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
