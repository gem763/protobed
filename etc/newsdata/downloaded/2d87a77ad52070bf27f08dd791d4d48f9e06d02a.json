Even PayPal, quit the group last week.\n\nReuters\n\nThis might seem alarming that major players exited the enterprise one after another, but the timing couldn't have been more perfect as today, on October 14th, all the founding partners were supposed to meet in Geneva for the first-ever Libra Council meeting.\n\nIt was at this meeting where they'd finalise different roles and that were to be executed by different parties and try to figure out all the governance questions that weren't revealed in the initial white paper.\n\nBasically this would have been the final formal charter with each of the aforementioned members signing in their name to the new agreement.\n\nDon't Miss 311 SHARES 305 SHARES 152 SHARES\n\nThis agreement would have involved stringent commitments from specific parties, as jotted down in the agreement. So it was best for someone who wasn't sure about joining in to step out before things got ironed out.\n\nAnd it isn't surprising for these companies to step out like this. Excluding eBay, all the other companies a part of Libra were actually payment processors. This basically means that these institutions have specific regulatory requirements when dealing with fraud, money laundering and sanctions enforcement situations.\n\nReuters\n\nGovernments across the globe were already doubtful of Libra and how it was planning on executing this. They were worried that Libra could be used for laundering money for criminal activities. If something were to have gone wrong, the payment processors would end up being held responsible too.\n\nPresence of these financial institutions would have otherwise helped Facebook create a secure and user-friendly system while also securing approval from regulators. Their exit now means Facebook will have to figure out the crucial nitty-gritty on its own.", "description": "Facebook's cryptocurrency project Libra faced a big blow as four payment processors-Stripe, Visa, Mastercard, and Mercado Pago pull back from participation in the Libra Association.
