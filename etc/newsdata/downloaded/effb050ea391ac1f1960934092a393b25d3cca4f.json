The NSC aide told Taylor that Sondland had communicated the quid pro quo to Andriy Yermak, a Ukrainian official. And as if that were not enough, Sondland told Taylor directly \u201cPresident Trump wanted President Zelenskyy \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement\u201d and that \u201ceverything\u201d (i.e. aid) was dependent on such an announcement. (Zelenskyy is how Taylor spelled the name in his remarks; in Ukraine, it\u2019s the preferred spelling of the president\u2019s name.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony also means trouble for outgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whom Taylor tags as a witness to this quid pro quo that Sondland intended to lay down. It\u2019s also trouble for the Justice Department, which couldn\u2019t manage to find anything wrong with this set of facts when a criminal referral was made, and which advised the acting director of national intelligence that he could not turn over the whistleblower complaint to Congress, as required by law.\n\nFor Republican toadies such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who have come up with one preposterous excuse after another to discount evidence of impeachable conduct, Taylor\u2019s testimony and the other witnesses he identifies pose a real problem. (Graham just this past weekend insisted, \u201cIf you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing.\u201d Is this enough, senator?)\n\nGoodness knows what excuses Republicans will come up with next, but we know now there is substantial evidence of the worst-case scenario: An American president tried to extort a foreign government into injecting itself into our election by finding dirt on a political opponent, using as leverage essential aid to an ally fighting against Russian aggression. That is what Republicans are being asked to defend.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony is significant for several reasons.\n\nFirst, Taylor identified even more witnesses \u2014 e.g. Perry, NSC aide Tim Morrison \u2014 who can substantiate eye-popping and entirely credible evidence that Trump abused his power.\n\nSecond, the misconduct is unlike any other offenses in the Trump administration or in any other administration. This is far worse than Watergate, since the president acted in ways contrary to the national interest to help his political ambitions. Trump extorted an ally that we are supposed to be defending from Russian aggression in order to obtain illegal help in getting him reelected. Trump put his own interests (dirt on Biden) above American democracy and above our national security needs, which entail resisting Russian aggression in Europe. No other president has ever betrayed our democracy and our interests so brazenly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThird, in recognizing the extraordinary nature of the misconduct and the evidence presented, Democrats remove the whistleblower from the equation (that person is irrelevant now that we have Taylor and others), strengthen House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s determination to keep the impeachment investigation tightly focused on Ukraine (nothing else Trump has done is as remotely serious) and do damage to the \u201cinappropriate but not impeachable\u201d defense that Republicans have bandied about.\n\nIf we have not reached a tipping point for Senate Republicans to stop defending Trump\u2019s high crimes and misdemeanors, we surely have reached the point at which we know whether there is any high crime and misdemeanor that would compel a significant number of Republicans to uphold their constitutional obligation. There won\u2019t be many, but I would hope that a few would finally step forward.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "What do Republicans do now?", "authors": ["Jennifer Rubin", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Policy", "Foreign", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4pO-rKDopXDvdQZJRHE_RQHlBSk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QCP45PHVB4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
