Then Coutinho comes and now the word is, \"How can they not start Muller?\" But it was obvious that if [Coutinho] comes things would be difficult for Muller,' said Hoeness.\n\nChairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge insists Muller still has a role to play at Bayern and remains highly valued but the forward may take some convincing.\n\nUnited have long fancied Muller having tried to sign him previously for Louis van Gaal but their lack of Champions League football could prove decisive.\n\nMuller has struggled for game time this season and is looking at a potential departure\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer is looking at bringing in attacking reinforcements to United\n\nInter Milan have also registered an interest in the World Cup winner as they look to replace the injured Alexis Sanchez, on loan from United.\n\nMuller is under contract until 2021 and doesn't turn 31 until next September so will still command a substantial fee should he push to go, particularly in January.\n\nUnited have also been considering the merits of 33-year old Mario Mandzukic from Juventus and Lyon's Moussa Dembele, 23.", "description": "Manchester United have made initial enquiries about the availability of Bayern Munich forward Thomas Muller.
