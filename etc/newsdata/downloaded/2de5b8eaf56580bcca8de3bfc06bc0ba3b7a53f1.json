The practice absences eventually led to his release from the organization.\n\nAfter going public about his displeasure for fines related to the missed practices, Brown reportedly got involved in a verbal confrontation with Raiders general manager Mike Mayock. The Raiders cut Brown last week, and he quickly signed a one-year deal with the Patriots that includes a team option for 2020.\n\nBrown's former trainer, Britney Taylor, filed a civil lawsuit against the receiver Tuesday alleging he sexually assaulted her three times in 2017 and 2018.\n\nMark Maske of the Washington Post reported this week that the NFL was considering placing Brown on paid leave via the commissioner's exempt list in order to investigate any potential wrongdoing.\n\nOn Friday, Schefter reported that the NFL will not place him on the exempt list as of now, meaning he is eligible to play against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.", "description": "Helmet manufacturer Xenith announced Friday it has ended its working relationship with  New England Patriots  wide receiver  Antonio Brown ...", "authors": ["Mike"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/828/036/hi-res-c9f0db7a1baf031631226631bfbdce11_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
