(Photo: Reviewed)\n\n\u2014 Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need. If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nWeekends are made for shopping, lazily from the couch in our PJs while our coffee gets cold and we ignore the TV. Amazon's got so many deals all the time that we want to help you avoid splurging on a sale that's not really a sale or getting something crappy that has a too-good-to-be-true price. So we comb through all the offers to find only the best, whether they're things we've tested ourselves and know you'll love or they're so adored by other shoppers that you really can't go wrong.\n\nMore: The 10 best sales and deals for Columbus Day weekend\n\n1. Save up to $30: Instant Pots in three colors\n\nThis is the best Instant Pot deal we've seen in at least a month. (Photo: Instant Pot)\n\nThe Instant Pot is probably the most coveted cooking device out there, and right now you can get the most popular model for a solid discount. The classic black option is $20 off, but you can get the more recently released teal and white models for nearly $30 less than usual. These aren't the lowest prices we've ever seen, but Instant Pots always start to sell out as we get closer to the holiday season. So you can maybe save another $10-$20 if you wait, but you might not be able to get one at all.\n\nIf you don't know much about the Instant Pot, the long and short is this pressure cooker makes cooking everything from soups and stews to eggs, yogurt, and cake easy, effortless, and so fast. We've got a handy Instant Pot guide that will walk you through all the basics of getting started if you'd like to learn more before you buy.\n\nGet the Instant Pot DUO60 7-in-1 Pressure Cooker for $71.99-$79.99 (Save $20-$30)\n\n2. Under $30: Faux sheepskin throw rugs\n\nFaux fur rugs add a touch of elegance, and these come at the perfect price. (Photo: Ashler)\n\nYou've seen them in catalogues, on TV, and maybe in your friends' homes. But this style of accept rug can be really expensive of an investment, even if you're steering well clear of those made from animals. But right now, Amazon has a Lightning Deal on these highly rated rugs for $11-$30, for up to 30% off. They come in four sizes and a bunch of fun colors (not ever color is on sale, sadly, but most are). You can choose round, rectangular of sheepskin style in two sizes, and the colors range from natural beiges and blacks to funky purples and teals. But this Lightning Deal won't last forever on these throw rugs with over 900 glowing reviews.\n\nGet an Ashler Soft Faux Sheepskin Fur Area Rug for $10.99+ (Save up to 30%)\n\n3. Save $50: A super in-depth DNA test kit\n\nThis weekend is the perfect time to get a DNA test kit for less. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf you want to learn what your genetic code has to say about you, a 23andMe DNA test kit might be the answer. Right now, you can get the typically $199 Health + Ancestry kit for $149. This test costs more than others because, in addition to showing you where your roots are, it also looks at your DNA for things like health predispostions for things like Celiac disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's. You can even see if you might be a carrier of any illnesses or conditions, providing an easy way to see if you should visit a doctor and discuss your health further.\n\nGet the 23andMe Health + Ancestry DNA Test Kit for $149 (Save $50)\n\n4. Save $25: The newest Echo with a screen\n\nThis compact Echo Show performs similarly as the big guy at a fraction of the price. (Photo: Amazon)\n\nThe Echo Show was Amazon's first foray into smart speakers with screens, and it was a hit. I still have mine and love the visual display of notifications and trending news and timers. They recently released the Show 5, a much smaller and sleeker version. It's also much cheaper, as the original (now in its second iteration) retails for $230 and the Show 5 typically costs just $90. Right now, it's $25 off, marking one of the lowest price we've seen outside of a Prime Day low of $50.\n\nGet the Echo Show 5 for $64.99 (Save $25)\n\n5. Under $25: The egg-stra large egg cooker everyone loves\n\nThis handy gadget makes eggs even easier. (Photo: Dash)\n\nWhether you meal prep or have a lot of mouths to feed, anything to make cooking a little easier is always welcome. The Dash Rapid Egg Cookers offer an amazingly simple way to make a big batch of hard-boiled eggs perfectly every time. This one holds a full dozen, and right now it's $5 off, marking the best price it's been since Prime Day. You can also soft-boil and poach eggs with this handy and adorable countertop gadget, and it makes omelets!\n\nGet the Dash Deluxe Rapid Egg Cooker in Black for $24.53 (Save $5)\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
