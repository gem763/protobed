Elizabeth Warren at the Democrats\u2019 latest debate, Joe Biden repeatedly criticized the progressive senator from Massachusetts, whose status has risen in recent months, making her a presidential primary front-runner alongside the former vice president.\n\nIn Columbus, Ohio, Biden questioned Warren\u2019s honesty and pushed back against the media\u2019s labeling of Warren as a \"co-front-runner.\"\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a front-runner,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou guys keep talking about that.\u201d\n\nJOE BIDEN'S POTENTIALLY TROUBLING CAMPAIGN CASH REPORT\n\nBiden did acknowledge, in referencing the latest polls, that \u201cWarren has done very well. She\u2019s moved.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president was the unrivaled leader of the pack in the 2020 nomination race even before he declared his candidacy in late April. But Warren, gaining stature in a field that once had some two dozen presidential hopefuls, has surged; in many of the most recent national, early-primary-state and caucus-state surveys, she\u2019s virtually tied Biden for the top spot.\n\nWarren\u2019s new status was clearly on display at Tuesday night\u2019s fourth-round nomination debate, when she came under attack from many of her rivals on the stage. Biden, who was the recipient of most of the incoming fire during the first three rounds of debates, was at times absent from the action.\n\nRIVALS TAKE ON WARREN OVER MEDICARE-FOR-ALL, MORE, AT DEBATE\n\nStill, Biden downplayed suggestions that he\u2019s been eclipsed by Warren, saying on the day after the debate that \u201cit's kind of about time other people get questioned.\u201d\n\nBut Warren's chief campaign strategist, Joe Rospars, pointing to the attention Warren received at the debate and to new fundraising reports that potentially hint at some trouble for Biden \u2013 tweeted on Wednesday that \u201cit\u2019s rare that we get as much real information in one day to clarify the state of the Democratic primary as we did yesterday.\u201d\n\nNear the top of Tuesday\u2019s debate, two primary rivals -- South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- forcefully took aim at Warren for not directly answering if she\u2019d raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for her push to implement a government-run \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d health care system.\n\nOn that score, Biden had this to say on Wednesday: \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential thing in this election in the minds of the American people, across the board. And you know, credibility matters. It matters.\u201d\n\n\"She\u2019s going to have to tell the truth, or a question will be raised about whether she\u2019s going to be candid and honest with the American people,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pick on Elizabeth Warren, but this is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.\u201d\n\nBiden, who opposes the Medicare-for-all plan long championed by more progressive rivals like Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont instead supports strengthening the Affordable Care Act with a public option.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION\n\n\u201cThe last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing (President) Trump\u2019s game and trying to con the American people to think this is easy,\"Biden said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing easy about it. If you\u2019re going to do it, tell us how you\u2019re going to do it. It\u2019s called truth in speaking.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign told Fox News that the senator is \u201creviewing the revenue options suggested by the 2016 Bernie [Sanders] campaign along with other revenue options.\u201d\n\nWarren further emphasized at the debate that \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not cut costs for middle-class families.\u201d\n\nBeyond health care, Biden criticized Warren for saying during the debate that \u201cI think that we [the United States] ought to get out of the Middle East.\u201d\n\nWarren \u2013 who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee \u2013 appeared to suggest an end to the decades-old U.S. military presence in the volatile Mideast. Her comments came during a discussion of President Trump\u2019s heavily criticized move to pull U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria.\n\nWhile Warren has long called for reducing America\u2019s military presence overseas, her campaign said after the debate that the candidate was talking only about combat troops.\n\n\u201cSenator Warren was referencing combat troops, not those stationed in the Middle East in non-combat roles. She believes we need to end the endless wars. That means working to responsibly remove U.S. troops from combat in the Middle East, and using diplomacy to work with allies and partners to end conflicts and suffering in the region,\u201d the campaign said in a statement.\n\nBiden, on Wednesday, said he \u201cfrankly was surprised\u201d by Warren\u2019s comments.\n\nThe former vice president \u2013 who repeatedly touts his foreign policy chops \u2013 added that \u201cI had never heard any say, with any serious background on foreign policy, that we pull all troops out of the Middle East. \u2026 I\u2019m not sure exactly what she meant by it.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIf she meant pulling our fleet out of the eastern Mediterranean or the Persian Gulf, I think it would be an absolute disaster for American security and American foreign policy.\u201d\n\nBiden repeated his criticism \u2013 without naming Warren \u2013 later Wednesday when he delivered a foreign policy address in Iowa.\n\nFox News' Tara Prindiville and Allie Raffa contributed to this report.", "description": "One day after being overshadowed by Sen.
