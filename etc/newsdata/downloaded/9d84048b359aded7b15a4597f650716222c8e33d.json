At times, Robertson has appeared to address these supporters, too, even attempting to explain away Trump\u2019s \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape scandal when, just a month before Election Day, audio emerged of Trump bragging about groping women.\n\nInstead of unequivocally condemning the remarks, Robertson praised Trump as being \u201clike the phoenix\u201d who would rise from the blow dealt to his campaign.\n\nBut for Robertson, who is known for spreading hateful views including homophobia and Islamophobia on-air, Trump\u2019s stance on Syria crossed a line.\n\nThe televangelist\u2019s remarks add to the outcry from a growing list of conservatives and foreign policy experts who have expressed shock at the White House\u2019s announcement, warning it spells danger for both the U.S. and the Kurds.", "description": "The right-wing televangelist tore into Trump's decision to leave Kurdish fighters in Syria to fend for themselves as Turkey prepares to invade.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9ba084210000b103ab9cc4.jpeg?cache=hnr9prnls0&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
