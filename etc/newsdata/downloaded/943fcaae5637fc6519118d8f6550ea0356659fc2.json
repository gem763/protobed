The state was in the process of removing her from its voter rolls.\n\n\u201cI voted three times last year,\u201d said Ms. Miller. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have any idea how many other individuals this has happened to.\u201d\n\nOhio, where the Democratic presidential candidates are set to debate Tuesday, is both a battleground state and the site of some of the country\u2019s strictest voting laws, from voter ID requirements to a \u201cuse-it-or-lose-it\u201d provision that lets officials drop voters seen as inactive.\n\nThe combination has led voting rights advocates to contend that parts of the state are regularly disenfranchised, largely in purges aimed at those who have died or moved away, but which also hit real voters who don\u2019t learn they can\u2019t vote until Election Day. Election officials in other battlegrounds such as Florida, North Carolina, Georgia and Texas regularly purge their voter lists as well.\n\nThis year, a group of elected officials in the state, mostly all moderate Republicans, tried to answer the concerns with an experiment of their own: Rather than purge the voter rolls behind closed doors as had been done in the past, the government released the full list of those to be removed this summer, and gave the list to advocacy groups. The groups said they found the list was riddled with errors.", "description": "When Ohio released a list of people it planned to strike from its voting rolls, around 40,000 people shouldn\u2019t have been on it.
