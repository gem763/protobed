Annual growth climbed from 0.2 per cent in 2014 to 2.1 per cent in 2018, and unemployment dropped by around half, to 6 per cent, over that period.\n\nThe budget deficit \u2013 long a torment for Portugal as governments routinely overspent \u2013 is now close to zero under the financial stewardship of finance minister Mario Centeno, who also chairs the meetings of finance ministers from the 19 European nations that use the Euro.\n\nMr Centeno is expected to continue in the post.\n\nThe Social Democrats are still associated in the public mind with deep cutbacks and a three-year recession that ended in 2014, when they were in government. Also, party leader Rui Rio has struggled to contain disagreements between factions of his party.\n\nPortugal has not witnessed the rise of populist or far-right parties which have come to prominence elsewhere in the EU. Protests in Portugal are traditionally channelled into a low turnout \u2013 only about half the country\u2019s eligible voters cast their ballot.\n\nThe next government faces plenty of challenges, including the United Kingdom\u2019s impending departure from the EU. The UK is one of Portugal\u2019s main export markets.\n\nWhile government spending is now more in line with revenues, Portugal\u2019s government debt is equivalent to more than 120 per cent of gross domestic product \u2013 the third-highest in the EU. And the combined government, private and corporate debt is more than three times the country\u2019s GDP, the Bank of Portugal says. If European interest rates rise, the Portuguese could find themselves in big trouble.\n\nOther challenges include climate change, as rainfall in the southern half of the country dwindles, and an ageing population that threatens the financing of the welfare system. The EU has said that at current fertility rates the number of Portuguese will decline from 10.3 million this year to 6.6 million in 2100.\n\nAP", "description": "The centre-left Socialist Party won the most votes in Portugal\u2018s general election on Sunday, leaving it poised to continue leading the government for another four years.
