David will narrate \"F**** \u2013 Now There Are Two of You,\" the newest installment in the \"Go the F*** to Sleep\" bedtime story series by Adam Mansbach.\n\nEntertainment Weekly confirmed David, the creator of \"Seinfeld\" who plays a fictionalized version of himself on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" has been tapped to narrate the book.\n\nIn \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" David is known to express his annoyances \u2013 even if voicing his opinion gets him in more trouble than it's worth. So, who better than to narrate the tongue-in-cheek book about a parent begrudgingly taking care of not one, but two kids.\n\nMansbach's first children's book \"Go the F*** to Sleep,\" which was about an annoyed parent desperately trying to get their kid to go to bed, was narrated by Samuel L. Jackson.\n\n\"I'm sure my parents experienced feelings similar to those of the narrator in this book,\" David said in a statement to EW. \"Is it any wonder I'm so f\u2011\u2011\u2011ed up?\" Mansbach/Brozman & Getty\n\nThe sarcastic book was more for parents than kids \u2013 and it sold more than 100,000 copies on Amazon. Jackson, known to play potty-mouthed characters, was a perfect narrator for the f-bomb-laced tale. Video of Jackson's dramatic reading of the book went viral in 2011.\n\nMansbach and illustrator Owen Brozman, who also created \"You Have to F\u2011\u2011\u2011ing Eat,\" are back for the new book, which will be out on October 1 and is available for preorder. It is unclear when David's audiobook version will be available.\n\nAs a father of two, David knows what it's like to be outnumbered by children. He's also a second-born child himself. \"I'm sure my parents experienced feelings similar to those of the narrator in this book,\" David said in a statement to EW. \"Is it any wonder I'm so f\u2011\u2011\u2011ed up?\"", "description": "What better narrator than David, who is known to voice his annoyance, no matter who the perpetrator", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/02/4653717d-4478-4663-ada4-4eb8448764f1/thumbnail/1200x630/4a93f0c78121945324b3f645ad8be144/untitled-collage-12.jpg"}
