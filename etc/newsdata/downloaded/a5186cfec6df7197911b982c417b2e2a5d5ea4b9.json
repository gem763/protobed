A year later, it recognized Bitcoin as a commodity, but continued to prohibit use.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Dr. Arminsyah commented.\n\n\u2026The development of technology and cryptocurrency crime that follows it will always grow without slowing down, let alone waiting for us to catch up, it will instead continue to go so fast, leaving behind anyone who\u2019s too late to anticipate and adopt it,\n\nHe continued,\n\nCross-country cryptocurrency crime must be seen as a common enemy, therefore it cannot be addressed or faced partially by each country but must be prevented, fought, and eradicated holistically and together.\n\nThe event saw attendance from Singapore, Malaysia, Turkey, Thailand, Australia, Russia and Hong Kong.\n\nAmong those, Singapore is notable in adopting a polar opposite stance on crypto to Indonesia. For years, its government has proactively encouraged development of legal frameworks for the phenomenon, as well as Blockchain technology.\n\nThe Myth Of Bitcoin Crime\n\nJakarta meanwhile has only doubled down on its zero-tolerance policy. Earlier this year, regulators confirmed they would not lift the ban.\n\nGoing forward, Arminsyah said he hoped the legal training would lead to more concerted efforts to fight crypto-based crime.\n\nHe summarized:\n\nI hope that the coordination established by the trainees is not merely formal\u2026 but also through informal cooperation, prosecutors to prosecutors, police to prosecutors, and customs to prosecutors, helping each other in the form of information delivery, data, advice, and the provision of facilities when they need each other.\n\nThe notion the Bitcoin in particular plays a significant role in criminal activity has seen frequent challenges.\n\nAs Bitcoinist noted, a report in July suggested Bitcoin darknet spending alone was 800 times lower than fiat spending.\n\nOther controversies still abound. Last month, North Korea denied using heists to amass crypto funds worth an alleged $2 billion.\n\nWhat do you think about Indonesia\u2019s stance on Bitcoin?
