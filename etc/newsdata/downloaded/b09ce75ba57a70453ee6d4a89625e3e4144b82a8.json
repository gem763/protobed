We only have one little container for 155 people per day.\"\n\nThe daycare looks after children from six months to pre-schoolers and according to Kelly, the kids produce about 120 dirty diapers a day,\n\nThe daycare occupies two different addresses side-by-side but gets only one property assessment, so it's trying to argue that it at least deserves two bins and 10 bags per pickup.\n\n\"The reality is that we don't only have four people in our house,\" she said.\n\nA 120 L garbage container was already overflowing Tuesday after just two days worth of diapers. (Hallie Cotnam/CBC)\n\nIn a statement, the city said all units get the same service and it will not provide an exemption to daycares at this time.\n\nKelly said hiring a private company to take its extra waste isn't an option because the daycare is subsidized and it can't make the parents pay for something that isn't actually the function of the daycare.\n\nNeither are cloth diapers because she said she can't force parents to use them.\n\nEven though it's not a real solution, she did threaten \u2014 as a pressure tactic \u2014 to send parents home with bags of their children's dirty diapers at the end of each day.\n\nBut she says even if she wanted to, it wouldn't work.\n\n\"Every time we give the diapers back we would put them in a plastic bag, so that's 40 plastic bags every day. It's not something we can do for the environment,\" she said.\n\nRight now she is hoping for a political solution.\n\n\"[We want] to sit with the city \u2026 so they can see what our problem is.\"\n\nIn the meantime she says they'll be putting out all the garbage in the hopes it gets picked up.", "description": "A busy daycare in Gatineau says new garbage rules that came into effect on Monday are unfair.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5287132.1568802351!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/line-kelly-executive-director-le-pays-de-cornemuse.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
