It instructs employees to prepare to take an exam on the \u201cstudy Xi\u201d propaganda app, launched earlier this year, in order to have their press credential renewed.\n\nMost believe the regulation will soon apply to Chinese reporters across the country. Journalists from three media organisations, two of which were outside Beijing, told the Guardian their publications had also received informal notices to register on the app.\n\n\u201cFrom the top down to the bottom, I don\u2019t think anyone will be able to escape it,\u201d said one reporter from a broadcaster in the eastern Shandong province who said he was not authorised to speak on the topic.\n\nThe on-site, closed-book exam, to be administered by news organisations in early October, will be divided into five parts, including two on Xi Jinping\u2019s teachings on socialism for the new era and Xi\u2019s \u201cimportant thoughts on propaganda\u201d, according to Media Reform, a self-published news account on WeChat.\n\nNews of the test, first reported by the South China Morning Post, comes as Chinese media face increasing restrictions. China is considered one of the least free countries to operate as a journalist, ranked 177 out of 180 in 2019 by Reporters Without Borders, above Eritrea and North Korea.\n\nWhile Chinese journalists face jail time and self-censorship is common, journalists especially from independent publications often push the envelope, investigating cases of local or corporate corruption. To get a press credential, journalists have previously been tested on their understanding of \u201cMarxist journalistic ideals.\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, it doesn\u2019t mean that much,\u201d the journalist from Shandong said. \u201cStill, it\u2019s a move to restrict public debate.\u201d\n\nAuthorities have stepped up their regulation of Chinese media and the internet, which already limits access to foreign websites, including news sites. In July, a draft regulation under China\u2019s social credit system proposed punishing citizens for publishing information that \u201cviolates social morality\u201d or causes \u201cadverse social impacts\u201d.\n\nXi has demanded loyalty from Chinese journalists before. In 2016, he told staff at three state-run news outlets in Beijing that they were \u201cthe propaganda fronts and must have the party as their family name\u201d.\n\nAccording to Media Reform, the exam for journalists is not expected to be difficult. The notice sent to reporters from their editors said news organisations should establish study groups and begin preparing for the test. Sample questions will soon be uploaded to the app, according to the news website Sohu.com.\n\nThe test will only be able to be retaken once. Journalists said they were not sure whether they would need to take it every time they renewed their press cards, done every five or six years.\n\nWhile some journalists said they resented the new rule, others were less critical. \u201cChinese society needs to strengthen political study and correctly lead public opinion,\u201d said a reporter with a paper in the south-western province of Guizhou, who asked not to be named.\n\n\u201cWestern media may be able to report on anything they want, but they also still pay attention to the ideology of their countries,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Lillian Yang", "description": "Exam will test journalists on president\u2019s teachings on socialism and propaganda", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad8036192dc371b4aef63bc4c4f956090967d691/0_54_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fc488422d1cc8b60010fc5b843528ece", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
