(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nRunning back Derrius Guice tweeted throughout the Washington Redskins\u2019 31-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday, as he recovers from knee surgery. Tight end Jordan Reed missed the game while spending his third week in the concussion protocol. Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams was last seen in an Instagram post Thursday standing in front of private plane, as he continues to hold out.\n\nThe Redskins are once again dealing with significant personnel losses, this time just two weeks into their season, and Sunday\u2019s result provided another reminder: Washington\u2019s roster simply is not deep enough to overcome the absence of so many of its upper-echelon players.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d running back Adrian Peterson said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for these practice-squad guys not to get lackadaisical because just like that you can be in there. ... You think about [Quinton] Dunbar, you think about [Jonathan] Allen, those are key parts of our defense. We\u2019re just going to need guys to step up. That\u2019s all we can do.\u201d\n\n[Key moments from Washington's Week 2 loss to Dallas]\n\nWashington is used to having to have players step into bigger roles, as the team has dealt with large numbers of injuries each of the last two seasons. But the proverbial \u201cnext man up\u201d approach is easier said than done. The Redskins were down two starters on defense in Dunbar and Allen, plus slot cornerback Fabian Moreau, requiring defensive lineman Tim Settle to make his first career start and cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie to make his first as member of the Redskins. Rookie Jimmy Moreland had a full workload in place of Moreau.\n\nWhile it\u2019s certainly unfair to put the loss on those three players, the defense as a whole was not up to the task against Dallas, allowing 111 rushing yards to running back Ezekiel Elliott and 26 of 30 passing from quarterback Dak Prescott. It wasn\u2019t much better on offense, where third-string tight end Jeremy Sprinkle and rookie receiver Kelvin Harmon both started on Sunday, combining for one catch and 11 yards.\n\nCoach Jay Gruden has repeatedly stated that Washington\u2019s winning formula is to play great defense, and run the ball and avoid turnovers on offense. While the Redskins have largely taken care of the ball, the running game and defense have been a problem. On Sunday, they managed just 47 rushing yards while giving up 474 yards and 31 points. The Cowboys scored touchdowns on four of five possessions starting in the second quarter, with the other possession resulting in a field goal.\n\nThere simply isn\u2019t enough firepower on this team to overcome deficits, and Sunday\u2019s loss was a reminder that there isn\u2019t enough depth to overcome the amount of missing players it had against Dallas. The Redskins\u2019 best hope is to get several of those key contributors back as soon as possible, ideally for next Monday night\u2019s game against the Chicago Bears.\n\nPeterson sets a milestone, but running game is in rough shape\n\nWith his one-yard touchdown plunge in the second quarter, Peterson surpassed the legendary Jim Brown to rank fifth on the NFL\u2019s career rushing touchdowns list with 107.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a blessing,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThis one means a lot more than the other ones will when I pass them, because Jim Brown\u2019s a guy that I looked up to. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to talk to him on several occasions. Just the look in his eyes when I\u2019m talking to him, that alone is just motivating to me. It feels good to have passed him today, but it\u2019s ... bittersweet because we didn\u2019t get this divisional win.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s running game had a rough go of things for the second consecutive week. After recording just 28 yards in the season opener against Philadelphia with Guice starting, Washington\u2019s rushing attack was similarly nonexistent against the Cowboys behind Peterson, who had 25 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how things will get easier next week, given that the Bears have one of the most formidable defenses in the NFL. The Redskins tried to augment Peterson\u2019s power running with three carries for speedy rookie wide receiver Steven Sims Jr., but he totaled just 16 yards.\n\nPenalties continue to derail Redskins\n\nA common sight on Sunday were yellow flags flying in from the officials, putting Washington\u2019s offense behind the chains or extending Dallas drives. The Redskins were guilty of six penalties against the Cowboys, bringing them to 18 for 140 yards over two games.\n\n\u201cEvery coach in the NFL teaches fundamental football,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cEventually we are going to have to execute a little bit better and make sure we understand that we\u2019re being watched very closely.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTwo games in, the Cowboys look every bit like a top NFC contender\n\nToo many near-misses doom the Redskins in a frustrating loss to the Cowboys", "description": "Washington was shorthanded versus Dallas, and the team proved once again it doesn't have the depth or firepower to overcome such substantial personnel losses.", "authors": ["Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins", "September At Pm", "Kareem Copeland Is The Post'S Washington Redskins Beat Writer.
