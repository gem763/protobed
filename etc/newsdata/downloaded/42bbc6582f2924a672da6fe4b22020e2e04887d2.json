The meeting comes after Iran bombed Saudi oil fields over the weekend with a drone, which Pompeo confirmed today was an act of war.\n\nHe made the comments onboard to reporters while in route to the Middle East.\n\nOn Iran: Pompeo called the attacks on Saudi Arabia an \u201cact of war\u201d \u2014 \"We were blessed there were no Americans killed in this attack, but anytime you have an act of war of this nature, there\u2019s always a risk that could happen.\u201d He told this to reporters on his flight to Jeddah. \u2014 Edward Wong (@ewong) September 18, 2019\n\nMore details from ABC News:\n\nA team of U.S. military forensics specialists is already on the ground to gather evidence from the sites of the attacks, Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters traveling with him in London.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. is gathering \u201ccompelling forensic evidence\u201d from the debris of the cruise missiles and drones at the two oil facilities attacked this weekend, said a U.S. official. That evidence \u201cwill provide a compelling case of where they came from,\u201d the official said.\n\n\n\nAnother U.S. official said there was enough information to show that the cruise missiles and drones were launched from southwestern Iran.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham also called the Iranian attack an act of war earlier today and urged President Trump to make that case at the United Nations General Assembly next week.\n\nSen.
