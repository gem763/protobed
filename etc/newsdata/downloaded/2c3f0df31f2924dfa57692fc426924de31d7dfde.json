Al Sharpton and Rep. Matt Gaetz sparred over the MSNBC commentator\u2019s past statements about Jews, whites and African-Americans.\n\nMr. Gaetz, Florida Republican, began his questioning by discussing a resolution introduced in 2000 by former Florida Rep. Joe Scarborough, who now hosts a show on MSNBC, condemning Mr. Sharpton for \u201cracist and antisemitic views.\u201d\n\nMr. Gaetz bombarded Mr. Sharpton with questions about whether quotes included in the resolution were true. Among the quotes included, Mr. Sharpton is alleged to have called Jews \u201cbloodsucking Jews and Jew bastards,\u201d \u201cdiamond merchants\u201d and \u201cwhite interlopers.\u201d\n\nMr. Sharpton said the quotes were \u201cpatently untrue.\u201d He did concede he referred to one individual in Harlem as an \u201cinterloper,\u201d but did not know he was Jewish.\n\nDemocrats immediately jumped to defend Mr. Sharpton, accusing the lawmaker of harassing the witness and asking questions that had nothing to do with the hearing\u2019s topic.\n\nRep. Shelia Jackson-Lee, Texas Democrat, called Mr. Gaetz\u2019s conduct \u201can outrage.\u201d And Rep. Cedric Richmond, Louisiana Democrat, asked his colleague if \u201cthe Fox News audition is over.\u201d\n\nCommittee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, New York Democrat, repeatedly pounded the gavel to restore order and accused his fellow committee member of \u201ccasting aspersions\u201d on the witness.\n\nAlthough Mr. Nadler called the questioning \u201cobnoxious,\u201d there was little he could do because members of Congress have \u201ca wide latitude\u201d to question witnesses\u2019 character and motives.\n\nMr. Gaetz insisted the comments were \u201chighly relevant\u201d to the police brutality hearing.\n\n\u201cRev. Sharpton has come before the House Judiciary Committee as a purported expert on policing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet his bigoted statements undermine the bipartisan work we should be doing to ensure that all citizens are able to come together and have safe communities.\u201d\n\nMr. Nadler struggled to keep control of the hearing as Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Sharpton shouted over each other. Mr. Sharpton told the lawmaker to \u201ccalm down\u201d and accused him of shouting.\n\nRep. Hank Johnson, Georgia Democrat, interrupted to ask if committee rules permitted Mr. Gaetz to engage in \u201ca constant tirade of attacking the witness.\u201d\n\nMr. Gaetz pressed on, asking Mr. Sharpton if he ever referred to African-Americans who disagreed with him as \u201ccocktail sip Negros,\u201d and \u201cyellow and the N-word.\u201d\n\nMr. Sharpton admitted he used the phrase \u201ccocktail sip Negros,\u201d but said he didn\u2019t know about the other comments.\n\n\u201cI have said things about blacks and whites,\u201d he responded. \u201cI\u2019m glad you made it clear that I don\u2019t only attack whites. Thank you for that.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
