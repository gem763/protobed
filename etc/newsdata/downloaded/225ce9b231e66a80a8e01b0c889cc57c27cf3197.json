(Getty Images)\n\nDustin Poirier isn\u2019t known as a knockout puncher in the way that, say, top heavyweight contender Francis Ngannou is. But Poirier has 12 knockouts in 22 UFC fights, including six in the first round.\n\nHis ability to make Khabib Nurmagomedov respect his potential to knock him out in their lightweight title unification bout in the main event of UFC 242 Saturday in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, will be the key to Poirier\u2019s chances of pulling off the historic upset.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nA Poirier win wouldn\u2019t nearly be the biggest upset in UFC history by the odds. At the MGM Grand, Nurmagomedov is minus-500 and Poirier is plus-350. At Station Casinos, Nurmagomedov is minus-450 and Poirier is plus-325.\n\nRonda Rousey was as much as a minus-1650 favorite over Holly Holm at UFC 193 on Nov. 15, 2015, in Melbourne, Australia, and as low as minus-750 by close. Georges St-Pierre was a minus-1300 favorite to defeat Matt Serra at UFC 69 in 2007, while Serra was a plus-850 underdog.\n\nBy those standards, Poirier over Nurmagomedov wouldn\u2019t be much of an upset at all.\n\nBut Nurmagomedov is 27-0 and arguably the greatest grappler in UFC history. He mauls his opponents and seemingly has no weakness once the fight gets to the ground.\n\nPoirier is a very good all-around fighter, but he\u2019s nowhere near Nurmagomedov\u2019s match when it comes to grappling.\n\nThe key for Poirier will be to avoid a grappling contest, and the best way to do that is for him to control distance and disrupt Nurmagomedov\u2019s timing. Poirier likes to pressure his opponents and get in their faces and strike at close range.\n\nBut that will make him more susceptible to a takedown and would put him into Nurmagomedov\u2019s world.\n\nStory continues\n\nNurmagomedov held a bigger advantage on the ground over Conor McGregor, whom he defeated with a fourth-round submission by neck crank at UFC 229 on Oct. 6, than he will against Poirier.\n\nBut McGregor has a more versatile and better stand-up attack than Poirier does.\n\nThe problem Poirier faces was shown in the first round and early in the second against McGregor. In the first, Nurmagomedov took McGregor down seconds into the round and kept him there. He tied McGregor\u2019s legs up and kept him on his back for most of the round. Though he didn\u2019t do much damage, he did make an impression on McGregor, who knew he couldn\u2019t let that happen again.\n\nAnd that set up a picture-perfect right hand by Nurmagomedov that landed on McGregor\u2019s chin. McGregor stumbled backward and stuck his hands out behind him, barely preventing an official knockdown. But the point was made: As soon as McGregor was preoccupied with Nurmagomedov\u2019s grappling, Nurmagomedov\u2019s striking became a factor.\n\nNurmagomedov is deadly with ground strikes and at one point in the second round, he\u2019d had a 59-3 edge in significant strikes on McGregor.\n\nPoirier can\u2019t afford to put himself in that spot. He needs to disrupt Nurmagomedov\u2019s rhythm and timing. He needs to throw, but he can\u2019t throw long combinations because that makes him susceptible to the takedown.\n\nBut if he uses his calf kick, throws a shot or two and then moves in a different direction, he can frustrate Nurmagomedov. The goal for Poirier should be to force Nurmagomedov to try to make a mistake at range on his feet. If he gets him reaching and off-balance, Poirier could catch him with something that hurts him.\n\nThe problem for Poirier is that Nurmagomedov is so physically strong, even if he gets knocked down, if he\u2019s not really badly hurt, he\u2019ll grab an arm or a leg and won\u2019t let go and he\u2019ll eventually turn it back into a grappling contest.\n\nPoirier looks to be in incredible shape, and has the confidence that comes from one of the best four-fight runs in recent years, with victories over Anthony Pettis, Justin Gaethje, Eddie Alvarez and Max Holloway.\n\nHe can win if he fights a mistake-free fight and capitalizes whenever Nurmagomedov makes a mistake.\n\nIt\u2019s a tall order, and unlikely as I see it. Look for Nurmagomedov to win a decision going away and to prove, with all due respect to Tony Ferguson, that he\u2019s the best lightweight in the world.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Poirier's ability to make Nurmagomedov respect his potential to knock him out in their lightweight title unification bout Saturday will be the key to his chances of pulling off the historic upset.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dXNrH6t8ZJJlM6YFcdXNEg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DFeOtaTaou8jRaK0ly5w0A--~B/aD0zMTI3O3c9NDY5MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/490a6720-d0b4-11e9-bfef-4180ed7add48", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
