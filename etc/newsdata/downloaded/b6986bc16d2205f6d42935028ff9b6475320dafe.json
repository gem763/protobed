(Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nAmy Cortes grew up amid farmland in the Shenandoah Valley, in a small town 15 miles from the stately campus of James Madison University. For much of her childhood, Cortes couldn\u2019t picture herself as a student there, walking among the academic buildings made of bluestone or lounging on the manicured quad, mountain ranges in the distance.\n\nShe visited Harrisonburg often \u2014 her church was there \u2014 and she found kinship in the city\u2019s Hispanic community. But all of the adults in her life worked in manual labor or the service industry, in poultry plants or cleaning hotels. She figured her life would follow a similar trajectory \u2014 graduate from high school, work in a factory.\n\n[\u2018They all kind of live through me\u2019: What it means to be first in your family to go to college]\n\nThen, a seventh-grade teacher told her about something new, something called the Valley Scholars. Apply, the teacher told the student. \u201cThis could turn into something great,\u201d the teacher said.\n\n\u201cShe was doing her job as a teacher,\u201d Cortes said, \u201cdefinitely looking after her students.\u201d\n\nSo Cortes applied, hoping to join an initiative to steer students from low-income households to become the first in their families to attend college. Cortes would have to make a five-year commitment, which pushed her toward the most demanding high school classes, required monthly meetings and sent her on weekend field trips.\n\nIf she maintained at least a 3.25 grade-point average, followed a rigorous curriculum and got accepted to James Madison, she would earn a scholarship covering tuition.\n\nNear the end of seventh grade, after Cortes finished the intimidating application process for the Valley Scholars, she received an email.\n\n\u201cWhy are you happy?\u201d Cortes recalled her mother asking.\n\nThe middle school student shared that she had been accepted.\n\nMother pulled daughter into a hug and said, \u201cNow, you have to make more of this.\u201d\n\nBut could she do it?\n\nJames Madison sits in a region steeped in troubles faced by rural communities across the country and is home to a significant population of working-class immigrants and refugees.\n\n\u201cWe needed to make more proactive efforts in our own backyard,\u201d said Jonathan R. Alger, president of the university. \u201cThere were a lot of students in our area who simply thought that college was not an option for them.\u201d\n\nThat desire gave rise to the Valley Scholars. Students were plucked from across the Shenandoah Valley, from schools with large populations of children who receive free or reduced-price school meals \u2014 a proxy for need.\n\nThere are 188 Valley Scholars from nearly two dozen middle and high schools in seven school systems across the region. Principals, teachers and guidance counselors identify promising middle school students. Each year, the university receives more than 100 applications for 44 slots.\n\nStudents are assessed on grades, test scores, a short essay and interviews. Families fill out a lengthy application, answering questions about income and Medicaid eligibility, another indicator of familial need. The university pays for the program with money from donors, including local corporations and the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation.\n\nShaun Mooney, director of Valley Scholars, said he fears that students in rural Virginia \u2014 including towns near the James Madison campus \u2014 are falling behind peers who attend school in suburban and urban neighborhoods. Advanced classes are sparse on some rural campuses, and some of the highest-performing students are drawn away to competitive magnet schools.\n\n\u201cRural communities are not seeing the same levels of economic investment. They\u2019re not seeing the same levels of economic attainment,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially in the South and Mid-Atlantic, there\u2019s a widening gap . . . of opportunity.\u201d\n\nThirty-five middle school students, including Cortes, were accepted into the program\u2019s inaugural class. Thirty-two completed the program, and all are attending college in Virginia, including the 26 students at James Madison.\n\nCortes is among them. She made it.\n\n\n\nYesenia Tenorio tearfully hugs her son, Oscar Moreno-Tenorio, on move-in day at James Madison. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nOscar Moreno-Tenorio, from Waynesboro, was another member of that inaugural class. The second oldest of five, Moreno wants to set an example for his younger siblings. Neither of his parents attended college \u2014 his father works in a lumber yard; his mother cares for the children.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them to end up working at a job where they\u2019re unhappy,\u201d Moreno-Tenorio said of his siblings.\n\nThe Fort Defiance High School band was between songs, and Cortes, a clarinetist, was preparing for the next number when a teacher pulled her aside. She was brought to family members who, between tears, told Cortes her father \u2014 a roofer \u2014 had fallen 30 feet onto concrete while on a job.\n\nThe family rushed to a hospital in Charlottesville, where they learned he had a fractured face, broken hands and minor spinal fractures. The accident unfolded as Cortes was about to take final exams her sophomore year.\n\nShe made hour-long trips to the Charlottesville hospital each day, finding it difficult to concentrate on school work as she worried about her father.\n\n\u201cIt was something so shocking and just hard to deal with,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to study. I was too sad.\u201d\n\nShe found comfort from other Valley Scholars, buoyed by their supportive messages and motivating words. Mooney reminded Cortes that the program was there for more than academic support \u2014 that he, the other program organizers and her fellow scholars were family, too.\n\n\n\nPierre Mbala immigrated to the United States from Congo. He is among the Valley Scholars . (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nPierre Mbala, an affable 18-year-old, relied on two of his classmates at Harrisonburg High School for rides to Valley Scholars meetings. They have texted in a group chat since eighth grade, trading reminders about deadlines and meetings.\n\nMbala and his family arrived in the United States from Congo in 2004, after they were granted asylum, eventually settling in Harrisonburg. Immigrants made up nearly 10 percent of the population in the Harrisonburg metro area in 2016, according to research from New American Economy, an organization that advocates for immigration policies that lead to economic growth. About 8 percent of those immigrants were thought to be refugees.\n\nThe 18-year-old abides by a mantra his parents imparted, a phrase in Swahili that translates to: \u201cDon\u2019t forget where you come from.\u201d\n\nMore than a year ago, Mbala\u2019s father shared a photo of a young girl in Congo hauling a bucket of rocks from a mine, presumably so cobalt could be extracted. Moved by the image, the teenager used $40 he earned from his job at a hotel to purchase bracelets and necklaces made in Congo. He resold the jewelry to classmates at Harrisonburg High School and to anyone who was interested.\n\nHe uses the money to support people in Congo who are in need. Eventually, Mbala wants to provide more for young people in his homeland who \u201cdon\u2019t have the same educational outcomes as me, who live in poverty, who don\u2019t receive adequate nutrition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat picture just struck me in the heart,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething lit in me that said, \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter a night of restless sleep, Mbala and his mother packed their car for the short drive to campus. They stopped for services at their church, where congregants sent him and other college-bound teens off with prayer.\n\nMbala was familiar with the James Madison campus, having frequented it for Valley Scholars meetings. But moving into his dorm felt like arriving anew.\n\nHe has gained a reputation among peers as a \u201csocial butterfly\u201d and cherishes meeting new people and learning from different perspectives.\n\nBut he has also yearned for a community on campus he can relate to on a different level and plans to join the Black Student Alliance. He hadn\u2019t seen any other black male students who are freshmen in his honors program at James Madison and noticed that, on campus, he sticks out \u201cas a sore thumb.\u201d\n\n\n\nFirst-year James Madison students reflect and share thoughts after a tour of Montpelier on Aug. 20. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nDays before the start of the school year, the 18-year-old found himself on a trip with other honors students to the sprawling grounds of Montpelier, the home of the nation\u2019s fourth president. Mbala was grouped with students whose first stop was an exhibit examining slavery and its enduring consequences.\n\nThe morning was heavy with reflection.\n\nStudents toured the reconstructed South Yard, a part of the property where enslaved people lived and labored. Enslaved people made up 39 percent of Virginia\u2019s population at one point in the 1790s, one feature in the exhibit showed. A tour guide pressed the young adults to consider that Madison\u2019s legacy is inextricable from the more than 300 people his family held in bondage.\n\nFor Mbala, stories of families separated by slavery conjured comparisons to the family separations unfolding in recent months at the U.S.-Mexico border. Mbala later said he was reminded of the way families in Congo have been torn apart by militias that recruit children to work in mines \u2014 a fate Mbala said his parents sought to spare him and his brothers from by emigrating.\n\n\u201cGod blessed us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want me and my five brothers to be put in a situation where we could miss an opportunity in education.\u201d\n\nMoments of levity broke through the hard conversations at Montpelier. At one point, students began comparing the sizes of their dorm rooms, and before long, the conversation landed on Mbala\u2019s nascent jewelry business.\n\nMbala plucked bracelets from a bag that rested on his hip, pulling out a beaded black bracelet with charms.\n\n\u201cThe symbols all mean different things,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe angel wing is protection. The tree is virtue. The flower is transformation. The hand is wisdom, and the horseshoe is luck.\u201d\n\nA week into school, Cortes, a kinesiology major, senses life will be much different. She lives on a residence hall floor with other honors students, traveling as a group to the dining hall or studying together in the lounge.\n\nShe said she\u2019s looking forward to honing her public-speaking skills in a communications class. She\u2019s most worried about passing her first couple of exams \u2014 that they will prove more challenging than the tests she encountered in high school.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t spent much face-to-face time with other Valley Scholars. But they regularly check in with each other in the group chat. And there\u2019s an understanding, Cortes said, that \u201cwe\u2019re here for each other.\u201d\n\nOne night shortly after moving on campus, Cortes and two of her best friends from the program sat in a dorm room, chatting.\n\n\u201cOur dream is actually coming true,\u201d one of Cortes\u2019s friends said.\n\nTogether, they marveled over having, finally, arrived.\n\n\n\nDaMillion Williams takes a break during move-in day at James Madison.
