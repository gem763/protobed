As three minutes of stoppage time was announced, one positioned himself to the right of Mauricio Pochettino, the other to his left.\n\nThere was no escaping the prying eyes of those at home \u2014 the majority of whom were left wondering whether Pochettino, manager of Tottenham Hotspur since 2014, is nearing the end.\n\nPrecisely 150 days ago, it was the same and yet so different. The cameras were fixated on the Spurs boss as he dissolved in tears, on his knees and tie askew in Amsterdam.\n\nMauricio Pochettino's Spurs side lost 3-0 against Brighton on Saturday afternoon\n\nTottenham had just secured their spot in the Champions League final. He was delirious.\n\nThey all were, with Harry Kane defying his injured ankle to charge onto the pitch to celebrate.\n\nFive months on, this is no longer a happy club. Those same players who performed so heroically in Europe have now been embarrassed twice in a week \u2014 7-2 by Bayern Munich, 3-0 by Brighton.\n\nOn Saturday, they came for a stroll by the seaside rather than to compete.\n\nHis side seemed to come for a stroll by the seaside on Saturday rather than to compete\n\nErik Lamela looked lazy, Eric Dier and Tanguy Ndombele showed no understanding in midfield, Christian Eriksen was daydreaming (perhaps about life in Madrid), Kane was a ghost, and Pochettino had no answers.\n\nAt 2-0, the home supporters could be heard singing: \u2018You\u2019re getting sacked in the morning.\u2019\n\nAt 3-0, they were louder, more discernible. How often have we heard that chanted at the Argentine? BT Sport pundit Joe Cole highlighted in his post-match analysis how he seemed \u2018uninterested on the touchline\u2019 and, according to insiders, that is coming across on the training pitch too, when he is there.\n\nAs revealed by Sportsmail, he has taken to watching some training via the club\u2019s CCTV system.\n\nThere were chants of 'You're getting sacked in the morning' directed at Pochettino\n\nFor so long, Pochettino has been untouchable. He had an air of immunity \u2014 he was above those stories of bookmakers slashing odds on the next boss to get the sack. The worry was he would walk out on Spurs \u2014 for Madrid or Manchester United \u2014 not that they might pull the trigger.\n\nThat is no longer the case. After two humbling defeats and 10 goals conceded in five days, the 47-year-old\u2019s future is as fragile as his defensive set-up. If Claudio Ranieri can get sacked after leading Leicester to the title, if Roberto Di Matteo can be binned by Chelsea after securing the Champions League, then Pochettino is not beyond the boot.\n\nThe big stumbling block of course is that it could cost the notoriously frugal chairman Daniel Levy up to \u00a332 million to sack Poch having given him an \u00a38m per annum five-year deal just over 12 months ago. But how long can he let it slide?\n\nThe working relationship between Pochettino and Levy became strained by disagreements over the summer.\n\nJurgen Klinsmann is one manager who would love to take on the Tottenham job\n\nOne is a coach, the other a businessman. What they do have in common, however, is both are tacticians. Levy will now be considering his next move.\n\nIf it comes to Poch getting the push who would come in?\n\nJurgen Klinsmann would love the job and has a great CV but has been out of management for some time.\n\nJose Mourinho is available but it is hard to imagine him working within Spurs\u2019 financial structure.\n\nThat would not be a problem for the much-admired Eddie Howe.\n\nEddie Howe would not have a problem with working under Tottenham's financial structure\n\nPochettino said the sight of his captain being carried off on a stretcher and receiving oxygen had a psychological effect on his players. Perhaps, but that cannot excuse their poor positioning and lack of energy in pressing.\n\nGraham Potter\u2019s brilliant Brighton had Tottenham\u2019s number from start to finish.\n\nAaron Connolly, the 19-year-old making his full Premier League debut, scored twice, while Neal Maupay capitalised on Hugo Lloris fumbling a routine catch for their opener.\n\nTo add to their woes, Lloris suffered a horrific dislocated elbow as he landed awkwardly. Moussa Sissoko, the midfielder used at right back, was given a rough ride, too, as all of Brighton\u2019s goals originated from his side.\n\nMoussa Sissoko backed Pochettino and the rest of the club's staff in a post on social media\n\nIn a bid to explain the team\u2019s troubles, Sissoko wrote on social media: \u2018It\u2019s not a lack of desire on our part, neither of the staff nor of the club, quite the contrary.\n\n\u2018We will only succeed in reversing the trend if we all do it together. It is all together that we will succeed in changing the situation. Let us remain united.\u2019\n\nA hint for the chairman, perhaps?", "description": "The BT Sport cameramen were not subtle.
