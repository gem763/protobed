Her sibling and mother are both teachers.\n\nVuyo was raised in a family where no one had a formal job, but his uncle ran a funeral parlour that had been established by his grandmother in 1967.\n\nInitially, he took no interest.\n\n\u201cI wanted to study analytical chemistry and got accepted at the University of the Witwatersrand, but I did not have money because my mother was a domestic worker,\u201d says Vuyo. \u201cSo, I went to QwaQwa in the Free State to study for a teaching diploma as it was free to do so there.\u201d\n\nAfter qualifying, he taught for a short time at Dr Vilakazi High School in Zola, Soweto.\n\nHe then worked at a casino. It proved to be his last salaried job.\n\n\u201cAfter working at Gold Reef City Casino for about two years, I absconded because I knew I was not meant to work a 9-to-5 job. At the time, the family\u2019s funeral business was closed and the building was unused. I approached a few of my cousins and asked them to help me resurrect the business,\u201d he says of the decision he took back in 2007.\n\nWith limited resources, Vuyo had to make a number of personal sacrifices. These included selling his furniture to buy coffins for display.\n\nHowever, the venture took a while to get up and running.\n\nThese days, Vuyo\u2019s Funeral Services caters for funeral as well as financial services, offering funeral cover.\n\n\u201cIt was bad,\u201d recalls Vuyo. \u201cI would do five funerals in eight months. I would open here and the whole week no one would come in.\u201d\n\nThe business started improving slowly, but the growth rate remained slow.\n\nThese days, Vuyo\u2019s Funeral Services caters for funeral as well as financial services, offering funeral cover.\n\nWhen Nkateko joined, the company had only five staff and a handful of signed-up funeral policies.\n\nIt is the latter aspect that saved the business, Vuyo says.\n\n\u201cI am a visionary; I come with ideas. But I am not good at administration. The business was doing okay, but the administration was terrible, so when Nkateko joined me in 2014, she came with the skills that the business needed.\u201d\n\nWhen Nkateko joined, the company had only five staff and a handful of signed-up funeral policies.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived, there were less than 300 sign-ons,\u201d Nkateko says.\n\n\u201cEven the underwriter was reluctant because the book was too small.\u201d\n\nThe effect of having too few clients was that even when the company found a willing underwriter, the premiums would be higher, recalls Ntaketo.\n\n\u201cOne of the underwriters told us to increase the book to 500 sign-ons at least, and he would take it on. Two years later, we had about 5 000 policyholders on our book,\u201d she says.\n\nAmong the changes the couple had to implement were: opening more branches that dealt specifically with sales; introducing a seamless administration regime that required less paperwork and relied more on software; and no longer accepting cash deposits \u2013 this being a stumbling block for the elderly, who have traditionally always paid their premiums in cash.\n\n\u201cWe lost some clients during that transition because most of the elderly clients did not adapt well. They were used to bringing money to our offices and getting cash receipts. With the introduction of sales consultants, we needed to avoid them having cash in hand so that they focused on their sales targets.\u201d\n\nVuyo continues: \u201cWe have five branches these days: three in Soweto, one in Orange Farm and another in Devland. To unlock the potential of the business, we had to focus on getting more policies instead of actual funerals, because the policies are secured business and could sustain us. When it comes to funerals, you cannot project how many you will get.\u201d\n\nVuyo says that because the policies usually comprise multiple covers for each client, recruiting the right people is key, as is offering excellent customer service.\n\nThe results speak for themselves: Vuyo\u2019s Funeral Services now has more than 40 000 clients, employs 111 staff and handles more than 25 funerals a week.\n\nThe biggest stumbling block thus far, Vuyo says, has been human resources.\n\nREAD: Until death do us part suddenly: How a widow picked up the financial pieces\n\n\u201cWe employ people in the communities in which we operate. As a result, we do not get skilled people, so we have to develop them. One of the bigger corporates once poached a lot of our staff all at once; these were people we spent money upskilling. At the time, we could not afford to hire skilled people, but we can now.\u201d\n\nSince the business has been able to recruit \u2013 and retain \u2013 skilled staff, the next step has been to professionalise its processes. This has led to the outsourcing of some human resources capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe do not compromise when giving funeral services because that good work becomes our advertising,\u201d says Vuyo.\n\n\u201cWe can afford to perform these services at a loss because we make more money on the financial services side. Most of our funerals come from referrals, so that model is working. Our focus is on the policies we offer.\u201d\n\nThe biggest misconception about the industry, the Mabindisas say, is that they are happy when people die.\n\n\u201cThat is untrue. When people die I lose premiums, whereas when they are alive we get business through premiums. We are not a death business because, in fact, when people die, sometimes we have to top up to offer a great funeral service,\u201d Vuyo says.\n\nThe Mabindisas plan to expand their business to neighbouring provinces.\n\nThey say that by continually innovating their business model, the expansion should happen sooner rather than later.", "description": "Vuyo and Nkateko Mabindisa have breathed life into a third-generation funeral parlour business in Soweto and transformed it into a thriving powerhouse.", "authors": ["Lesetja Malope"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9493/fa80e143a63a42888fb81628657ae292.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
