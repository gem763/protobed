Oh, but it\u2019s complicated, says a new University of Southern California, Los Angeles Times survey. Amazingly enough, 54% of all voters now say President Trump is going to win the White House race once again \u2014 that includes 40% of Democrats, 47% of independents and 74% of Republicans.\n\nWell all right, then. Now comes either jubilation or the gnashing of teeth, depending on the political party.\n\n\u201cWhen asked how they would feel if Trump was elected to a second term, 18% of all eligible voters say they would be completely happy and 42% say they would be completely unhappy. Seventy-six percent of Republicans and 37% of GOP leaners said they would be completely or mostly happy, compared with 15% of unaffiliated and other party voters and only 2% of affiliated Democrats. An overwhelming 9 out of 10 affiliated Democrats said they would be completely or mostly unhappy if Trump wins again,\u201d the survey analysis said.\n\n\u201cThis poll says \u2018buy Valium stock,\u2019\u201d advises Mike Murphy, co-director of the Dornsife Center for the Political Future on the California campus.\n\n\u201cOne huge chunk of the country is going to be really unhappy if Trump wins and another huge chunk will be unhappy if the Democratic nominee wins. We are so polarized now that it\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m right and you\u2019re evil,\u2019\u201d he observes.\n\nThe poll of 5,390 registered U.S. voters was conducted July 12-Aug. 11 and released Aug. 22.\n\nSO CONFIRM THEM, ALREADY\n\nThe Senate comes back into session Monday \u2014 and some say one item should top the to-do list: Confirm close to 150 pending Trump administration nominees.\n\n\u201cSenate Democrats are doing their best to ensure that the executive branch lacks the staff necessary to advance President Trump and the GOP\u2019s bold, conservative agenda. It\u2019s time for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the president\u2019s Republican allies to pick up the pace and chip away at the nominees awaiting confirmation,\u201d says Adam Brandon, president of FreedomWorks, a grassroots group embracing smaller government and lower taxes.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has nominated these great candidates, and it\u2019s the Senate\u2019s job to confirm them. There are currently 146 nominees awaiting Senate confirmation, compared to the 91 at this point during Obama\u2019s presidency. The Republican Senate showed potential, having recently confirmed more than 60 judges and other executive branch nominees, but there\u2019s still more that can and must be done. FreedomWorks calls upon the Senate to keep up the good work and focus on confirming President Trump\u2019s nominees,\u201d Mr. Brandon observes.\n\nThe organization launches a national campaign Wednesday to bring this idea home; stay tuned.\n\nTHE FOX NEWS FOLKS HAVE A SAY\n\nYes, there has been chatter of a skirmish between President Trump and Fox News. The possibility has been covered in the news media, particularly by Politico media analyst Jack Shafer, who recently suggested this is a \u201cfake feud\u201d fostered by Mr. Trump to keep excitement brewing, and that Fox News benefited by appearing to \u201cstand up\u201d to the president and thus bolster its credibility.\n\nFox News folks responded to such ideas immediately, so much so that The New York Times provided a play-by-play. Here is the Times account, verbatim:\n\nNeil Cavuto, an anchor for Fox News and Fox Business Network who has been critical of Mr. Trump in the past, said on the air: \u201cMr. President, we don\u2019t work for you. I don\u2019t work for you. My job is to cover you, not fawn over you or rip you. Just report on you \u2014 to call balls and strikes on you. My job, Mr. President \u2014 our job here \u2014 is to keep score, not settle scores.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re entitled to your point of view, Mr. President,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut you\u2019re not entitled to your own set of facts.\u201d\n\nBrit Hume, a senior political analyst for Fox News, echoed Mr. Cavuto\u2019s comments and tweeted, \u201cFox News isn\u2019t supposed to work for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have tried to be fair to him in our news coverage,\u201d Mr. Hume said in another tweet responding to someone who had asked why Mr. Trump thought Fox worked for him. \u201cBest example: we didn\u2019t fall for the Russia conspiracy theory that ended in such a fiasco for other outlets. Plus, some of our opinion hosts support Trump. (Others don\u2019t.)\u201d\n\nBoth Fox News and the White House declined to comment on the Times report.\n\nREADING, WRITING AND $459\n\nSomething to ponder as the nation\u2019s school year gets underway. For some of the principal players, it is not an easy time. Teachers are tapping into their own wallets to buy classroom supplies, and 9 out of 10 will not be reimbursed according to survey data from the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\n\u201cThe nation\u2019s kindergarten through 12th-grade public school teachers shell out, on average, $459 on school supplies for which they are not reimbursed. This figure does not include the dollars teachers spend but are reimbursed for by their school districts. The $459-per-teacher average is for all teachers, including the small (4.9%) share who do not spend any of their own money on school supplies,\u201d the Economic Policy Institute says in its analysis of the data.\n\nTeachers in California spend the most at $664 each, followed by Hawaii ($561), Arizona ($552), New Mexico ($545), Rhode Island ($538), Washington, D.C. ($527), Delaware ($507), Alaska ($496), Maryland ($492) and New York ($480) to round out the top 10.\n\nMEANWHILE IN THE LONE STAR STATE\n\nTexas has become the first state to reclassify its 911 telecommunicators and include them as first responders alongside peace officers, firefighters, and emergency medical personnel. It is cause for celebration.\n\nThe North Central Texas Emergency Communications District will host a 911 First Responder commencement ceremony on Thursday to mark the new designation spelled out in Texas House Bill 1090, which became law Sunday and ensures the reclassification. Prior to the legislation, the 911 folks had been classified as secretaries.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 66% of Americans give the restaurant industry a positive review; 61% say the same of the computer industry and 58% of the grocery industry.\n\n\u2022 53% give the automotive industry a positive review; 50% say the same about banking and 46% about the sports industry.\n\n\u2022 42% give airlines a positive review; 43% say the same of the internet industry and 41% for the movie industry.\n\n\u2022 40% give the TV and radio industry a positive review, 38% say the same of the healthcare industry and 35% for the legal field.\n\n\u2022 33% give advertising and PR a positive review; 27% say the same of the pharmaceutical industry, 25% for the federal government.\n\nSource: A Gallup poll of 1,525 U.S. adults conducted Aug. 1-14 and released Tuesday.\n\n\u2022 Helpful information to [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
