Two years after holding an independence referendum and unilaterally declaring independence in defiance of the Spanish state \u2014 then failing to gain recognition for la rep\u00fablica and being forced to watch political leaders jailed or exiled \u2014 Catalonia\u2019s secessionist movement has resurfaced with a major splash.\n\nOne of the first protest actions programmed by a new online activist group, calling itself Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic, saw thousands of protestors coalescing on Barcelona airport Monday, in an attempt to shut it down. The protest didn\u2019t quite do that but it did lead to major disruption, with roads blocked by human traffic as protestors walked down the highway and the cancelation of more than 100 flights, plus hours of delays for travellers arriving into El Prat.\n\nFor months leading up to a major Supreme Court verdict on the fate of imprisoned Catalan political leaders a \u2018technical elite\u2018 \u2014 as one local political science academic described them this week \u2014 has been preparing to reboot Catalonia\u2019s independence movement by developing bespoke, decentralized high-tech protest tools.\n\nA source with knowledge of Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic, speaking to TechCrunch on condition of anonymity, told us that \u201chigh level developers\u201d located all around the world are involved in the effort, divvying up coding tasks as per any large scale IT project and leveraging open source resources (such as the RetroShare node-based networking platform) to channel grassroots support for independence into a resilient campaign network that can\u2019t be stopped by the arrest of a few leaders.\n\nDemonstrators at the airport on Monday were responding directly to a call to blockade the main terminal posted to the group\u2019s Telegram channel.\n\nAdditional waves of protest are being planned and programmed via a bespoke Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic app that was also released this week for Android smartphones \u2014 as a sideload, not yet a Google Play download.\n\nThe app is intended to supplement mainstream social network platform broadcasts by mobilizing smaller, localized groups of supporters to carry out peaceful acts of civil disobedience all over Catalonia.\n\nOur source walked us through the app, which requires location permission to function in order that administrators can map available human resources to co-ordinate protests. We\u2019re told a user\u2019s precise location is not shared but rather that an obfuscated, more fuzzy location marker gets sent. However the app\u2019s source code has not yet been open sourced so users have to take such claims on trust (open sourcing is said to be the plan \u2014 but only once the app has been scrubbed of any identifying traces, per the source).\n\nThe app requires a QR code to be activated. This is a security measure intended to manage activation in stages, via trusted circles of acquaintances, to limit the risk of infiltration by state authorities. Though it feels a bit like a viral gamification tactic to encourage people to spread the word and generate publicity organically by asking their friends if they have a code or not.\n\nWhatever it\u2019s really for the chatter seems to be working. During our meeting over coffee we overheard a group of people sitting at another table talking about the app. And at the time of writing Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic has announced 15,000 successful QR code activations so far. Though it\u2019s not clear how successful the intended flashmob civil disobedience game-plan will be at this nascent stage.\n\nOnce activated, app users are asked to specify their availability (i.e. days and times of day) for carrying out civil disobedience actions. And to specify if they own certain mobility resources which could be utilized as part of a protest (e.g. car, scooter, bike, tractor).\n\nExamples of potential actions described to us by our source were go-slows to bring traffic grinding to a halt and faux shopping sprees targeting supermarkets where activists could spend a few hours piling carts high with goods before leaving them abandoned in the store for someone else to clean up.\n\nOne actual early action carried out by activists from the group last month targeted a branch of the local CaixaBank with a masked protestor sit-in.\n\nOur source said the intention is to include a pop-up in the app as a sort of contract of conscience which asks users to confirm participation in the organized chaos will be entirely peaceful. Here\u2019s an example of what the comprometo looks like:\n\nUsers are also asked to confirm both their intention to participate in a forthcoming action (meaning the app will capture attendance numbers for protests ahead of time) and to check in when they get there so its administrators can track actual participation in real-time.\n\nThe app doesn\u2019t ask for any personal data during onboarding \u2014 there\u2019s no account creation etc \u2014 although users are agreeing to their location being pervasively tracked.\n\nAnd it\u2019s at least possible that other personal data could be passed via, for example, a comment submission field that lets people send feedback on actions. Or if the app ends up recording other data via access to smartphone sensors.\n\nThe other key point is that users only see actions related to their stated availability and tracked location. So, from a protestor\u2019s point of view, they see only a tiny piece of the Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic protest program. The user view is decentralized and information is distributed strictly piecemeal, on a need to know basis.\n\nBehind the scenes \u2014 where unknown administrators are accessing its data and devising and managing protest actions to distribute via the app \u2014 there may be an entirely centralized view of available human protest resources. But it\u2019s not clear what the other side of the platform looks like. Our source was unable to show it to us or articulate what it looks like.\n\nCertainly, administrators are in a position to cancel planned actions if, for example, there\u2019s not enough participation \u2014 meaning they can invisibly manage external optics around engagement with the cause. Not enough foot soldiers for a planned protest? Just call it off quietly via the app.\n\nAlso not at all clear: Who the driving forces are behind the Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic protest mask?\n\n\u201cThere is no thinking brain, there are many brains,\u201d a spokesman for the movement told the El Diario newspaper this week. But that does raise pretty major questions about democratic legitimacy. Because, well, if you\u2019re claiming to be fighting for democracy by mobilizing popular support, and you\u2019re doing it from inside a Western democracy, can you really claim that while your organization remains in the shadows?\n\nEven if your aim is non-violent political protest, and your hierarchy is genuinely decentralized, which is the suggestive claim here, unless you\u2019re offering transparency of structure so as to make your movement\u2019s composition and administration visible to outside scrutiny (so that your claims of democratic legitimacy can be independently verified) then individual protestors (the app\u2019s end users) just have to take your word for it.\n\nEnd users who are being crowdsourced and coopted to act out via app instruction as if they\u2019re pawns on a high tech chess board. They are also being asked (implicitly) to shoulder direct personal risk in order that a faceless movement generates bottom up political pressure.\n\nSo there\u2019s a troubling contradiction here for a movement that has chosen to include the word \u2018democractic\u2019 in its name. (The brand is a reference to a phase used by jailed Catalan cultural leader, Jordi Cuixart.) Who or what is powering this wave?\n\nWe also now know all too well how the double-sided nature of platforms means these fast-flowing technosocial channels can easily be misappropriated by motivated interest groups to gamify and manipulate opinion (and even action) en masse. This has been made amply clear in recent years with political disinformation campaigns mushrooming into view all over the online place.\n\nSo while emoji-strewn political protest messages calling for people to mobilize at a particular street corner might seem a bit of harmless \u2018Pokemon Go\u2019-style urban fun, the upshot can \u2014 and this week has \u2014 been far less predictable and riskier than its gamified packaging might suggest.\n\nPlenty of protests have gone off peacefully, certainly. Others \u2014 often those going on after dusk and late into the night \u2014 have devolved into ugly scenes and destructive clashes.\n\nThere is clearly a huge challenge for decentralized movements (and indeed technologies) when it comes to creating legitimate governance structures that don\u2019t simply repeat the hierarchies of the existing (centralized) authorities and systems they\u2019re seeking to challenge.\n\nThe anarchy-loving crypto community\u2019s inability to coalesce around a way to progress with blockchain technology looks like its own self-defeating irony. A faceless movement fighting for \u2018democracy\u2019 from behind an app mask that allows its elite string-pullers and data crunchers to remain out of sight risks looking like another.\n\nNone of the protestors we\u2019ve spoken to could say for sure who\u2019s behind Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic. One suggested it\u2019s just \u201ccitizens\u201d or else the same people who helped organize the 2017 Catalan independence referendum \u2014 managing the movement of ballot papers into and out of an unofficial network of polling stations so that votes could be collected and counted despite Spanish authorities\u2019 best efforts to seize and destroy them.\n\nThere was also a sophisticated technology support effort at the time to support the vote and ensure information about polling stations remained available in the face of website takedowns by the Spanish state.\n\nOur source was equally vague when asked who is behind the Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic app. Which, if the decentralizing philosophy does indeed run right through the network \u2014 as a resilience strategy to protect its members from being ratted out to the police \u2014 is what you\u2019d expected.\n\nAny single node wouldn\u2019t know or want to know much of other nodes. But that just leaves a vacuum at the core of the thing which looks alien to democratic enquiry.\n\nOne thing Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic has been at pains to make plain in all (visible) communications to its supporters is that protests must be peaceful. But, again, while technology tools are great enablers it\u2019s not always clear exactly what fire you\u2019re lighting once momentum is pooled and channeled. And protests which started peacefully this week have devolved into running battles with police with missiles being thrown, fires lit and rubber bullets fired.\n\nSome reports have suggested overly aggressive police response to crowds gathering has triggered and flipped otherwise calm protestors. What\u2019s certain is there are injuries on both sides. Today almost 100 people were reported to have been hurt across three nights of protest action. A general strike and the biggest manifestation yet is planned for Friday in Barcelona. So the city is braced for more trouble as smartphone screens blink with fresh protest instructions.\n\nSocial media is of course a conduit for very many things. At its most corporate and anodyne its stated mission can be expressed flavorlessly \u2014 as with Facebook\u2019s claimed purpose of \u2018connecting people\u2019. (Though distracting and/or outraging is often closer to the mark.)\n\nIn practice, thanks to human nature \u2014 so that means political agendas, financial interests and all the rest of our various and frequently conflicting desires \u2014 all sorts of sparks can fly. None more visibly than during mass mobilizations where groups with a shared agenda rapidly come together to amplify a cause and agitate for change.\n\nEven movements that start with the best intentions \u2014 and put their organizers and administration right out in the open for all to see and query \u2014 can lose control of outcomes.\n\nNot least because malicious outsiders often seize the opportunity to blend in and act out, using the cover of an organized protest to create a violent disturbance. (And there have been some reports filtering across Catalan social media claiming right wing thugs have been causing trouble and that secret police are intentionally stirring things up to smear the movement.)\n\nSo if a highly charged political campaign is being masterminded and micromanaged remotely, by unknown entities shielded behind screens, there are many more questions we need to be asking about where the balance of risk and power lies, as well as whether a badge of \u2018pro-democracy\u2019 can really be justified.\n\nFor Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic and Catalonia\u2019s independence movement generally this week\u2019s protests look to be just the start of a dug-in, tech-fuelled guerrilla campaign of civil disobedience \u2014 to try to force a change of political weather. Spain also has yet another general election looming so the timing offers the whiff of opportunity.\n\nThe El Prat blockade that kicked off the latest round of Catalan unrest seemed intended to be a flashy opening drama. To mirror and reference the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong \u2014 which made the international airport there a focal point for its own protests, occupying the terminal building and disrupting flights in an attempt to draw the world\u2019s attention to their plight.\n\nIn a further parallel with protests in Hong Kong a crowdsourced map similar to HKmaps.live \u2014 the app that dynamically maps street closures and police presence by overlaying emoji onto a city view \u2014 is also being prepared for Catalonia by those involved in the pro-independence movement.\n\nAt the time of writing a handful of emoji helicopters, road blocks and vans are visible on a map of Barcelona. Tapping on an emoji brings up dated details such as what a police van was doing and whether it had a camera. A verified status suggests multiple reports will be required before an icon is displayed. We understand people will be able to report street activity for live-mapping via a Telegram bot.\n\nOur source suggested police presence on the map might be depicted by chick emojis. Aka Piol\u00edn: The Spanish name for the Loony Tunes cartoon character Tweety Pie \u2014 a reference to a colorfully decorated cruise ship used to house scores of Spanish national police in Barcelona harbor during the 2017 referendum, providing instant meme material. Though the test version we\u2019ve seen seems to be using a mixture of dogs and chicks.\n\nAlong with the Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic app the live map means there will soon be two bespoke tools supporting a campaign of civil disobedience whose unknown organizers clearly hope will go the distance.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said, the identities of the people coordinating the rebooted movement remain unclear. It\u2019s also unclear who if anyone is financing it.\n\nOur source suggested technical resources to run and maintain the apps are being crowdsourced by volunteers. But some commentators argue that a source of funding would be needed to support everything that\u2019s being delivered, technically and logistically. The app certainly seems far more sophisticated than a weekend project job.\n\nThere has been some high level public expressions of support for Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic \u2014 such as from former Barcelona football club trainer, Pep Guardiola, who this week put out a video badged with the Tsunami D logo in which he defends the democratic right to assembly and protest, warning that free speech is being threatened and claiming \u201cSpain is experiencing a drift towards authoritarianism\u201d. So wealthy backers of Catalan independence aren\u2019t exactly hard to find.\n\nA message to the world from Pep Guardiola \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/WdUKEyLyjO \u2014 Jordi Pu1gnerO (@jordiPuignero) October 14, 2019\n\nWhoever is involved behind the scenes \u2014 whether with financing or just technical and organization support \u2014 it\u2019s clear that \u2018free\u2019 protest energy is being liberally donated to the cause by a highly engaged population of pro-independence supporters.\n\nGrassroots support for Catalan independence is both plentiful, highly engaged, geographically dispersed and cuts across generations \u2014 sometimes in surprising ways. One mother we spoke to who said she was too ill to go to Monday\u2019s airport protest recounted her disappointment when her teenage kids told her they weren\u2019t going because they wanted to finish their homework.\n\nVery many protestors did go though, answering calls to action in their messaging apps or via the printable posters made available online by Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic which some street protestors have been pictured holding.\n\nThousands of demonstrators occupied the main Barcelona airport terminal building, sat and sang protest songs, daubed quasi apologetic messages on the windows in English (saying a lack of democracy is worse than missing a flight), and faced off to lines of police in riot gear \u2014 including units of Spanish national police discharging rubber bullets. One protestor was later reported by local press to have lost an eye.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s time to make our voice heard in the world,\u2019 runs Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic\u2019s message on Telegram calling for a blockade of the airport. It then sets out the objective (an airport shut down) and instructs supporters that all forms of transport are \u201cvalid\u201d to further the mission of disrupting business as usual. \u2018Share and see you all at T1!\u2019 it ends. Around 240,000 people saw the instruction, per Telegram\u2019s ephemeral view counts.\n\nLater the same evening the channel sent another message instructing protestors to call it a night. \u2018Today we have been a tsunami,\u2019 it reads in Catalan. \u2018We will make every victory a mobilization. We have started a cycle of non-violent, civil disobedience.\u2019 At the time of writing that follow-on missive has registered 300k+ views.\n\nWhile Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic is just one of multiple pro-independence groups arranging and mobilizing regional protests \u2014 such as the CDRs, aka Comites de Defensa de la Republica, which have been blocking highways in Catalonia for the past two years \u2014 it\u2019s quickly garnered majority momentum since quietly uncloaking this summer.\n\nIts Telegram channel \u2014 which was only created in August \u2014 has piled on followers in recent weeks. Other pro-independence groups are also sharing news and distributing plans over Telegram\u2019s platform and, more widely, on social media outlets such as twitter. Though none has amassed such a big following, nor indeed with such viral speed.\n\nEven Anonymous Catalonia\u2019s Telegram channel, which has been putting out a steady stream of unfiltered crowdsourced protest content this week \u2014 replete with videos of burning bins, siren blaring police vans and scattering crowds, interspersed with photos of empty roads (successful blockades) and the odd rubber bullet wound \u2014 only has a \u2018mere\u2019 100k+ subscribers.\n\nAnd while Facebook-owned WhatsApp was a major first source of protest messaging around the 2017 Catalan referendum, with Telegram just coming on stream as an alternative for trying to communicate out of sight of the Spanish state, the protest mobilization baton appears to have been passed more fully to Telegram now.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s partly due to an element of mistrust around mainstream platforms controlled by tech giants who might be leant on by states to block content (Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic has said it doesn\u2019t yet have an iOS version of its app, despite many requests for one, because the \u2018politics of the App Store is very restrictive\u2019 \u2014 making a direct reference to Apple pulling the HKmaps app from its store). Whereas Telegram\u2019s founder, Pavel Durov, is famously resistant to authoritarian state power.\n\nThough, most likely, it\u2019s a result of some powerful tools Telegram provides for managing and moderating channels.\n\nThe upshot is Telegram\u2019s messaging platform has enjoyed a surge in downloads in Spain during this month\u2019s regional unrest \u2014 as WhatsApp-loving locals flirt with a rival platform also in response to calls from their political channels to get on Telegram for detailed instructions of the next demo.\n\nPer App Annie, Telegram has leapt up the top free downloads charts for Google Play in Spain \u2014 rising from eleventh place into the third spot this month. While, for iOS, it\u2019s holding steady in the top free downloads slot.\n\nAlso growing in parallel: Unrest on Catalonia\u2019s streets.\n\nSince Monday\u2019s airport protest tensions have certainly escalated. Roads across the region have been blockaded. Street furniture and vehicles torched. DIY missiles thrown at charging police.\n\nBy Thursday morning there were reports of police firing teargas and police vehicles being driven at high speed around protesting crowds of youths. Two people were reported run over.\n\nHelicopters have become a routine sound ripping up the urban night sky. While the tally of injury counts continues rising on both sides. And all the while there are countless videos circulating on social media to be sifted through to reinforce your own point of view \u2014 screening looping clashes between protestors and baton wielding police. One video doing the rounds last night appeared to show protestors targeting a police helicopter with fireworks. Russian propaganda outlets have of course been quick to seize on and amplify divisive visuals.\n\nThe trigger for a return to waves of technology-fuelled civil disobedience \u2014 as were also seen across Catalonia around the time of the 2017 referendum \u2014 are lengthy prison terms handed down by Spain\u2019s Supreme Court on Monday. Twelve political and civic society leaders involved in the referendum were convicted, nine on charges of sedition and misuse of public funds. None were found guilty of the more serious charge of rebellion \u2014 but the sentences were still harsh, ranging from 13 years to nine.\n\nThe jailed leaders \u2014 dubbed presos pol\u00edtics (aka political prisoners) by Catalan society, which liberally deploys yellow looped-ribbons as a solidarity symbol in support of the presos \u2014 had already spent almost two years in prison without bail.\n\nA report this week in El Diario, citing a source in Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic, suggests the activist movement was established in response to a growing feeling across the region\u2019s independence movement that a new way of mobilizing and carrying out protests was needed in the wake of the failed 2017 independence bid.\n\nThe expected draconian Supreme Court verdict marked a natural start-date for the reboot.\n\nA reboot has been necessary because, with so many of its figureheads in prison \u2014 and former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont in exile in Brussels \u2014 there has been something of a leadership vacuum for the secessionist cause.\n\nThat coupled with a sense of persecution at the hands of a centralized state which suspended Catalonia\u2019s regional autonomy in the wake of the illegal referendum, invoking a \u2018nuclear option\u2019 constitutional provision to dismiss the government and call fresh elections, likely explains why the revived independence movement has been taking inspiration from blockchain-style decentralization.\n\nOur source also told us blockchain thinking has informed the design and structure of the app.\n\nDiscussing the developers who have pulled the app together they said it\u2019s not only a passionately engaged Catalan techie diaspora, donating their time and expertise to help civic society respond to what\u2019s seen as long-standing political persecution, but \u2014 more generally \u2014 coders and technologists with an interest in participating in what they hope will be the largest experiment in participatory democracy and peaceful civil disobedience.\n\nThe source pointed to research conducted by Erica Chenoweth, a political scientist at Harvard University, who found non-violent, civil disobedience campaigns to be a far more powerful way of shaping world politics than violence. She also found such campaigns need engage only 3.5% of the population to succeed. And at 300k+ subscribers Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic\u2019s Telegram channel may have already passed that threshold, given the population of Catalonia is only around 7.6M.\n\nIt sounds like some of the developers helping the movement are being enticed by the prospect of applying powerful mobile platform technologies to a strong political cause as a way to stress testing democratic structures \u2014 and perhaps play at reconfiguring them. If the tools are successful at capturing intention and sustaining action and so engaging and activating citizens in a long term political campaign.\n\nWe\u2019re told the stated intention to open source the app is also a goal in order to make it available for other causes to pick up and use to press for change. Which does start to sound a little bit like regime change as a service\u2026\n\nStepping back, there is also a question of whether micromanaged civic disobedience is philosophically different to more organic expressions of discontent.\n\nThere is an element of non-violent protest being weaponized against an opponent when you\u2019re running it via an app. Because the participants are being remotely controlled and coordinated at a distance, at the same time as ubiquitous location-sensitive mobile technologies mean the way in which the controlling entity speaks to them can be precisely targeted to push their buttons and nudge action.\n\nYes, it\u2019s true that the right to peaceful assembly and protest is a cornerstone of democracy. Nor is it exactly a new phenomenon that mobile technology has facilitated this democratic expression. In journalist Giles Tremlett\u2019s travelogue book about his adopted country, Ghosts of Spain, he recounts how in the days following the 2004 Madrid train bombings anonymous text messages started to spread via mobile phone \u2014 leading to mass, spontaneous street demonstrations.\n\nAt the time there were conflicting reports of who was responsible for the bombings, as the government sought to blame the Basque terrorist group ETA for what would turn out to be the work of Islamic terrorists. Right on the eve of an election voters in Spain were faced with a crucial political decision \u2014 having just learnt that the police had in fact arrested three Moroccans for the bomb attacks, suggesting the government had been lying.\n\n\u201cA new political phenomenon was born that day \u2014 the instant text message demonstration,\u201d Tremlett writes. \u201cAnonymous text messages began to fly from mobile phone to mobile phone. They became known as the p\u00e1salo messages, because each ended with an exhortation to \u2018Pass it on\u2019. It was like chain mail, but instant.\u201d\n\nMore than fifteen years on from those early days of consumer mobile technology and SMS text messaging, instant now means so much more than it did \u2014 with almost everyone in a wealthy Western region like Catalonia carrying a powerful, Internet-connected computer and streaming videocamera in their pocket.\n\nModern mobile technology turns humans into high tech data nodes, capable of receiving and transmitting information. So a protestor now can not only opt in to instructions for a targeted action but respond and receive feedback in a way that makes them feel personally empowered.\n\nFrom one perspective, what\u2019s emerging from high tech \u2018push button\u2019 smartphone-enabled protest movements, like we\u2019re now seeing in Catalonia and Hong Kong, might seem to represent the start of a new model for democratic participation \u2014 as the old order of representative democracy fails to keep pace with changing political tastes and desires, just as governments can\u2019t keep up technologically.\n\nBut the risk is it\u2019s just a technological elite in the regime-change driving seat. Which sums to governance not by established democratic processes but via the interests of a privileged elite with the wealth and expertise to hack the system and create new ones that can mobilize citizens to act like pawns.\n\nEstablished democratic processes may indeed be flawed and in need of a degree of reform but they have also been developed and stress-tested over generations. Which means they have layers of accountability checks and balances baked in to try to balance out competing interests.\n\nThrowing all that out in favor of a \u2018democracy app\u2019 sounds like the sort of disruption Facebook has turned into an infamous dark art.\n\nFor individual protestors, then, who are participating as willing pawns in this platform-enabled protest, you might call it selfie-style self-determination; they get to feel active and present; they experience the spectacle of political action which can be instantly and conveniently snapped for channel sharing with other mobilized friends who then reflect social validation back. But by doing all that they\u2019re also giving up their agency.\n\nBecause all this \u2018protest\u2019 action is flowing across the surface of an asymmetric platform. The infrastructure natively cloaks any centralized interests and at very least allows opaque forces to push a cause at cheap scale.\n\n\u201cI felt so small,\u201d one young female protestor told us, recounting via WhatsApp audio message, what had gone down during a protest action in Barcelona yesterday evening. Things started out fun and peaceful, with participants encouraged to toss toilet rolls up in the air \u2014 because, per the organizer\u2019s messaging, \u2018there\u2019s a lot of shit to clean up\u2019 \u2014 but events took a different turn later, as protestors moved to another location and some began trying to break into a police building.\n\nA truck arrived from a side street being driven by protestors who used it to blockade the entrance to the building to try to stop police getting out. Police warning shots were fired into the air. Then the Spanish national police turned up, driving towards the crowd at high speed and coming armed with rubber not foam bullets.\n\nFaced with a more aggressive police presence the crowd tried to disperse \u2014 creating a frightening crush in which she was caught up. \u201cI was getting crushed all the time. It wasn\u2019t fun,\u201d she told us. \u201cWe moved away but there was a huge mass of people being crushed the whole time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was truly scary weren\u2019t the crowds or the bullets, it was not knowing what was going on,\u201d she added.\n\nYet, despite the fear and uncertainty, she was back out on the streets to protest again the next night \u2014 armed with a smartphone.\n\nEnric Luj\u00e1n, a PhD student and adjunct professor in political science at the University of Barcelona \u2014 and also the guy whose incisive Twitter thread fingers the forces behind the Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic app as a \u201ctechnological elite\u201d \u2014 argues that the movement has essentially created a \u201chuman botnet\u201d. This feels like a questionable capability for a pro-democracy movement when combined with its own paradoxically closed structure.\n\nDivendres, dia de vaga general, una petita elit pol\u00edtica i tecnol\u00f2gica ja haur\u00e0 adquirit la capacitat operativa per paralitzar tot el pa\u00eds llan\u00e7ant convocat\u00f2ries descentralitzades i en temps real des de la m\u00e9s extrema opacitat. Han aconseguit crear una botnet humana. \u2014 Enric Luj\u00e1n (@imGeheimen) October 15, 2019\n\n\u201cThe intention appears to be to group a mass movement under a label which, paradoxically, is opaque, which carries the real risk of a lack of internal democracy,\u201d Luj\u00e1n tells TechCrunch. \u201cThere is a basic paradox in Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic. That it\u2019s a pro-democracy movement where: 1) the \u2018core\u2019 that decides actions is not accessible to other supporters; 2) it has the word \u2018Democr\u00e0tic\u2019 in its name but its protocols as an organization are extremely vertical and are in the hands of an elite that decides the objectives and defines the timing of mobilization; 3) it\u2019s \u2018deterritorialized\u2019 with respect to the local reality (unlike the CDRs): opacity and verticality would allow them to lead the entire effort from outside the country.\u201d\n\nLuj\u00e1n believes the movement is essentially a continuation of the same organizing forces which drove support for pro-independence political parties around the 2017 referendum \u2014 such as the Catalan cultural organization \u00d2mnium \u2014 now coming back together after a period of \u201cstrategic readjustment\u201d.\n\n\u201cShortly after the conclusion of the referendum, through the arrest of its political leaders, the independence movement was \u2018decapitated\u2019 and there were months of political paralysis,\u201d he says, arguing that this explains the focus on applying mobile technology in a way that allows for completely anonymous orchestration of protests, as a strategy to protect itself from further arrests.\n\n\u201cThis strategic option, of course, entails lack of public scrutiny of the debates and decisions, which is a problem and involves treating people as \u2018pawns\u2019 or \u2018human botnets\u2019 acting under your direction,\u201d he adds.\n\nHe is also critical of the group not having opened the app\u2019s code which has made it difficult to understand exactly how user data is being handled by the app and whether or not there are any security flaws. Essentially, there is no simple way for outsiders to validate trustworthiness.\n\nHis analysis of the app\u2019s APK raises further questions. Luj\u00e1n says he believes it also requests microphone permissions in addition to location and camera access (the latter for reading the QR code).\n\nOur source told us that as far as they are aware the app does not access the microphone by default. Though screenshots of requested permissions which have circulated on social media show a toggle where microphone access seems as if it can be enabled.\n\nQualsevol empresa ho pot fer amb apps q passen el filtre Google Play.\n\nI d moment, sense haver denegat cap perm\u00eds, de forma predeterminada nom\u00e9s estan activats la ubicaci\u00f3 (amb un motiu q ja has explicat) i la c\u00e0mera (per escanejar el QR, amb la qual cosa ja podr\u00eda descativar-lo). pic.twitter.com/TMgQcN402q \u2014 Albert (@Albertet1981) October 16, 2019\n\nAnd, as Luj\u00e1n points out, the prospect of a powerful and opaque entity with access to the real-time location of thousands of people plus the ability to remotely activate smartphone cameras and microphones to surveil people\u2019s surroundings does sound pretty close to the plot of a Black Mirror episode\u2026\n\nLes similituds amb un cap\u00edtol de Black Mirror s\u00f3n, evidentment, esfere\u00efdores: Una entitat de la que no sabem res (excepte el seu alt nivell de sofisticaci\u00f3 tecnol\u00f2gica) \u00e9s a punt de guanyar el control efectiu de tot un territori, operant des de la m\u00e9s absoluta foscor. \u2014 Enric Luj\u00e1n (@imGeheimen) October 15, 2019\n\nAsked whether he believes we\u2019re seeing an emergent model for a more participatory, grassroots form of democracy enabled by modern mobile technologies or a powerful techie elite playing at reconfiguring existing power structures by building and distributing systems that keep them shielded from democratic view where they can nudge others to spread their message, he says he leans towards the latter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a movement with an elite leadership that seems to have had a clear timetable for months. It remains to be seen what they\u2019ll be able to do. But it is clearly not spontaneous (the domain of the website was registered in July) and the application needed months to develop,\u201d he notes. \u201cI am not clear that it can be or was \u2018crowdsourced\u2019 \u2014 as far as I know, there was no campaign to finance Tsunami or their technological solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cRelease the code,\u201d he adds. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they haven\u2019t released it. Promising it is easy and is what you expect if you want to present yourself with a minimum of transparency, but there is no defined deadline to do so. For now we have to work with the APK, which is more cumbersome to understand how the app works and how it uses and moves user data.\u201d\n\n\u201cI imagine it is so the police cannot investigate thoroughly, but it also means others lose the possibility of better understanding how a product that\u2019s been designed by people who rely on anonymity works, and have to rely that the elite technologists in charge of developing the app have not committed any security breach.\u201d\n\nSo, here too, more questions and more uncertainty.", "description": "Is our age of ubiquitous smartphones and social media turning into an era of mass civil unrest?
