Our policy remains that we should not delay [and] that we should leave the EU on 31 October.\"\n\nIrish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he welcomed the backing of MPs for the deal, adding: \"We will now await further developments from London and Brussels about next steps, including [the] timetable for the legislation and the need for an extension.\"\n\nBut Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was now \"very hard to see how it is possible\" to get a deal through Parliament by the end of the month.\n\nIf an election were to be triggered this week, the earliest it could take place would be Thursday 28 November, as the law requires 25 days between an election being called in Parliament and polling day.\n\nBut Mr Johnson cannot force an election himself and would need the backing of Parliament.\n\nMPs had been due to debate the bill over Wednesday and Thursday, but will now return to discussing the contents of the Queen's Speech - which put forward the government's domestic agenda for the new session of Parliament.\n\nConfused about what just happened?
