The best part is Harris\u2019s puzzled \u201cAll right.\u201d\n\nKAMALA HARRIS: My pronouns are she, her and hers. CHRIS CUOMO: Mine, too. HARRIS: Alright. pic.twitter.com/09gJ2pygjd \u2014 Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) October 11, 2019\n\nCuomo\u2019s apologizing today for what he claims was a poor joke, although the first time I watched it I thought maybe he had gotten distracted and said something agreeable in the moment. Think of someone who\u2019s on a call with a business associate that\u2019s winding down and, by force of habit from conversation with his wife, signs off absentmindedly with, \u201cBye, love you.\u201d Maybe producers were chattering to him in his earpiece, he missed part of what Harris said, and chimed in unthinkingly with \u201cMine too\u201d to try to fill the momentary silence.\n\nI mean, he could have gone with that explanation. Instead his preferred explanation is that no, he\u2019s just a tin-eared dope.\n\nKamala Harris declared her pronouns on such a major stage and she should be applauded but instead it was so disappointing for Chris Cuomo to mock it in that moment. #EqualityTownHall #PowerOfOurPride \u2014 GLAAD (@glaad) October 11, 2019\n\nPLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall. \u2014 Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) October 11, 2019\n\nWe don\u2019t call him \u201cFredo\u201d for nothing.\n\nYou know what the difference is between Chris Cuomo and Andrew Cuomo? Chris at least had the good sense to retreat. Andrew is so eager to identify himself with \u201cvulnerable\u201d groups that he\u2019d own the mistake and start running around today insisting that, no, really, he\u2019s using feminine pronouns now.\n\nAnd then we\u2019d tell that story to our grandchildren as how New York State came to have its first woman governor.\n\nHere\u2019s a bonus clip for you of Grandpa Joe doing his best to engage with the subject matter and not succeeding. Question for anyone who watched last night: Did Cuomo or one of the other hosts ever ask the candidates how many genders they believe there are? Someone has to pose that at a debate before the primaries are over.", "description": "Okay then.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cc-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
