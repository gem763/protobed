Thomas and his team of four Buffalo cops and an FBI agent were making home visits, a form of intervention that Buffalo police had recently begun relying on more heavily to head off imminent violence. These meetings alert likely victims or shooters that they are at risk of death or arrest unless they choose a different path. If successful, the police get invited back with social workers offering an array of services\u2014GED classes, job training, counseling, rehab\u2014in a bid to prevent recurring cycles of violence. One stop had been added at the last minute. Earlier that day, a drive-by shooter had fired multiple rounds at a 21-year-old from a rival gang, who scrambled unhurt into his aunt\u2019s house. Police investigating the incident had come and gone. As Thomas approached the encounter with the would-be victim, Darnell Clark, he brimmed with optimism. \u201cThis guy could be dead right now,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe after this shooting, he\u2019s like, \u2018Man, I need to change my life.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwenty minutes later, Thomas returned to his patrol car proclaiming the meeting a qualified success. He told me later that Clark had been nonchalant at first but eventually opened up a bit, and that Clark\u2019s mother, who\u2019d also been there, had listened to Thomas\u2019s spiel about connecting the family to social services that might keep her son out of danger or criminal trouble, and then gave Thomas her name and number to be contacted again. (Clark\u2019s name has been changed at the police department\u2019s request, for his and his family\u2019s protection.) That, Thomas concluded, constituted progress. \u201cThey get to see the police in a different light,\u201d he said, \u201cthat we\u2019re there because we\u2019re concerned and we want to help.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s their hope, at least. The reality can be messier, as I found out when I spoke with Clark\u2019s mother. (Clark, who ended up in jail 10 weeks later on unrelated charges, didn\u2019t respond to a letter requesting comment.) She told me that she distrusts the Buffalo police so much that the whole interaction had struck her as \u201cfake,\u201d and was impossible to see as the start of something good for her family. \u201cThat\u2019s not how our Buffalo police work,\u201d she said. \u201cThey really do not do that. They don\u2019t come out; they don\u2019t speak to people. That never happened in Buffalo, and I\u2019ve been here 46 years.\u201d\n\nThis disconnect underscores one of the central challenges of reducing urban violence in the neighborhoods most in need of help, where alienation from police runs high. The overall U.S. homicide rate has plunged by half since a peak in 1991, and yet it remains one of the highest in the world\u2019s wealthy nations, with many cities struggling with alarming spasms of violence. While mass shootings in random public places grab attention in the press, homicides are much more often the result of personal squabbles among small groups of young men. Just last year, three of the U.S. cities suffering chronic neighborhood violence\u2014Chicago, Baltimore, and Philadelphia\u2014lost more lives on their streets than the number killed nationwide in the past half century in the most feared types of shooting rampages. Read: The gun violence that\u2019s a bigger threat to kids than school shootings Because street violence is so much more common, it has yielded a solid body of empirical evidence of what works to prevent it. Those Buffalo police found themselves on Clark\u2019s doorstep owing to a grant program in New York that encourages cities to use the best evidence-based strategies for reducing urban gun violence by paying for the necessary resources. Buffalo could use the help. Until this year, five years into the program, its street-shooting numbers hadn\u2019t budged. Thomas\u2019s boss, Carmen Menza, admits that the police don\u2019t yet know if the new approaches work. But, he says, \u201cat least we\u2019re trying to do something, rather than just wait for the violence to happen.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that kind of resolve that inspired one of the architects of the New York grant program, Thomas Abt, to want to teach more cities how to start using\u2014and how to stick with\u2014the best violence-reduction strategies. His thinking breaks from political orthodoxy on both the left and the right: The main reason violence is so persistent in the United States, he believes, isn\u2019t that gun laws are too weak (a common argument among liberals) or that police critics have hamstrung tough street-clearing tactics (an often-stated conservative belief). It\u2019s that not enough cities, whatever their political leanings, are properly using basic strategies that are known to persuade would-be shooters not to acquire guns, and not to use them on one another, in the first place.\n\nAbt turned what he learned in the past two decades in law-enforcement jobs, and now as a Harvard crime researcher, into a how-to manual published in late June called Bleeding Out: The Devastating Consequences of Urban Violence\u2014And a Bold New Plan for Peace in the Streets. Written for a mainstream audience, the book translates complex violence-reduction science into paint-by-numbers simplicity, even to the point of predicting, unusually, how many lives would be saved by following his formula. He told me, \u201cI wanted people to put the book down and be like, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s go do this.\u2019\u201d\n\nAbt, a 47-year-old with tousled, professorial hair, a neat graying beard, and chunky glasses, is a self-described \u201ccrime nerd.\u201d He had a sheltered upbringing in the affluent college town of Cambridge, Massachusetts, as the son of an MIT-educated father who founded the social-science research firm Abt Associates and a Harvard-educated mother who is a banking and economic-development consultant. But turning 18 in 1990, when U.S. handgun homicides had nearly doubled since five years earlier, meant reaching adulthood, Abt said, \u201cprecisely during the time when America was most violent and when we never knew whether it would ever get any less violent.\u201d Even though violence began to drop in the 1990s, Abt saw its tenacious hold on cities up close in an experience during law school at Georgetown University, when he taught a civics class in a Northwest Washington, D.C., neighborhood and lost a favorite student to murder, and again in his first job out of law school, as a prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, where he spent four years. After Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, Abt was working on the administration\u2019s transition team when he was introduced to Laurie Robinson, the assistant attorney general overseeing the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Justice Programs, which conducts and finances criminal-justice research. Before long, Robinson installed Abt as a key aide. Intent on steering the office\u2019s programs toward a reform agenda rooted in the science of crime reduction, Robinson entrusted Abt with a start-up project spreading expertise to cities struggling with youth violence.\n\nThe partnership with Robinson exposed Abt to the growing confidence among crime scientists about the proven effectiveness of a handful of law-enforcement and crime-prevention strategies focused on targeting concentrated violence\u2014among a tiny number of people, in a tiny number of places. But the more he learned, the more frustrated he grew with the lack of a clear road map showing cities what to do. Cities with many resources and sophistication, such as New York and Los Angeles, had mastered data analysis and the latest interventions against gangs and guns, and had seen violent crime drop. But too many other cities needed help catching up. \u201cI felt like everything we needed to know was out there, but no one had put it together,\u201d he said. In June 2013, Abt left Washington for Albany to oversee New York State\u2019s criminal-justice agencies. There, he helped revamp a moribund 10-year-old grant program that had an annual budget of $13 million to underwrite local anti-violence enforcement efforts. The program was renamed Gun Involved Violence Elimination (GIVE), and its mission was to help the state\u2019s smaller cities replicate New York City\u2019s dramatic success at reducing violence using evidence-based strategies.\n\nA Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence study from 2017 singled out New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut for extending such aid to their cities, though it called New York\u2019s program \u201cunique\u201d for its focus on gun violence. California recently tripled a similar program\u2019s budget to $27 million, and Illinois officials hope to plow legal-marijuana tax revenues into anti-violence programs. The Council of State Governments Justice Center, a crime-policy think tank, has helped Oklahoma, Missouri, and Ohio devise plans to reinvest savings from shrinking prisons into violence reduction. But for all the talk of evidence-based violence prevention, Abt said, \u201cthat\u2019s really more a matter of appearances than reality.\u201d He feels cities too often improvise changes to the strategies that undercut their effectiveness, and drop programs without giving them a fair chance to work. Rene\u00e9 Mitchell, a co-founder of the four-year-old American Society of Evidence-Based Policing, agrees that too few police departments use the best strategies effectively or extensively enough. The result, she says, is that the movement her organization seeks to spark has barely begun. \u201cBy not using evidence-based policing, I think we waste taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think we harm our communities.\u201d Read: The normalization of gun violence in poor communities To launch GIVE in 2014, Abt and Mike Green, the executive deputy commissioner of New York\u2019s Division of Criminal Justice Services, visited nearly all of the 17 upstate and Long Island cities in the program. What they saw in Buffalo, New York\u2019s second-largest city, made a strong impression\u2014though not in a good way. It has levels of concentrated poverty and segregation that almost invariably equate to higher crime.\n\nBut some of the city\u2019s problems were self-inflicted. The police had a legacy of misconduct and heavy-handed tactics\u2014multiple beatings and excessive arrests for low-level offenses\u2014that had bred resentment in the hardest-hit neighborhoods, and they had not completely shed their bad reputation. A \u201cstrike force\u201d unit that conducted widespread stop-and-frisks and warrantless home raids epitomized the department\u2019s brutish enforcement tactics. GIVE\u2019s strategies sounded to some like a radical departure. On top of that, Green and Abt observed bureaucratic backstabbing in lieu of cross-agency collaboration. Abt said of the new approach, \u201cThey weren\u2019t necessarily opposed to it, but they just weren\u2019t aware\u201d of how well these strategies had worked elsewhere. To enlist local support, Abt and Green sold their idea as a supportive, not dictatorial, endeavor. They were prescriptive, though, when it came to forming an anti-violence strategy. In return for annual grants for each county, ranging from less than $200,000 for the smallest counties to nearly $1.7 million for the largest in the program (Erie County, which includes Buffalo), New York police departments and other agencies had to pick at least two strategies from a list of four, and had to use the strategies exactly as described by Green\u2019s agency. Those four strategies, which had consistently earned top ratings for effectiveness, were: hot-spots policing, in which officers saturate areas prone to gun violence; focused deterrence, in which law-enforcement officials warn high-risk people of the consequences of continued violence, while social workers swoop in with services such as mental-health counseling; crime prevention through environmental design, involving improvements such as adding streetlights and cleaning up vacant lots so they won\u2019t serve as crime magnets; and street outreach, in which \u201cviolence interrupters\u201d\u2014not officers but civilians, often former gang members themselves\u2014mediate disputes and counsel high-risk people. The strategies were infused with principles of procedural justice, which hold that police and other justice officials must use fairness and transparency to win community support in order to reduce crime.\n\nBeyond reimbursing cities for their hard costs and footing the bill for a network of sophisticated crime-data centers, Green\u2019s agency created the Criminal Justice Knowledge Bank, which shares innovative practices and news about research while connecting police with researchers. After receiving a GIVE grant in July 2014, Buffalo police began using all of the endorsed strategies, but leaned most heavily on deploying saturation police patrols to the department\u2019s two most violent districts, both in the city\u2019s East Side neighborhood. The patrols had one overriding focus, says Joseph Gramaglia, the deputy police commissioner overseeing the GIVE project: \u201cGuns. Everything is guns.\u201d But after all of Abt and Green\u2019s work to persuade Buffalo to adopt GIVE, something upsetting happened: Having hit a recent low point in 2013\u2014the year before GIVE\u2014shootings bounced back to a disturbingly high number of more than 200 a year. (In 2018, New York City, with a population more than 32 times greater than Buffalo\u2019s, had fewer than four times as many shootings.) And even though GIVE grants come with a mandate for police departments to balance tough enforcement with measures aimed at winning back citizens\u2019 trust, one police-reform advocate, the State University of New York at Buffalo law professor Anjana Malhotra, says the department\u2019s continued strained relationships in the most violent neighborhoods show that the police still favor hard-nosed tactics over fence-mending. \u201cThere\u2019s a community consensus that they want to reduce violence, but there\u2019s a serious distrust issue with the police,\u201d says Malhotra, who co-authored a 2017 study documenting claims of racially biased policing in Buffalo.\n\nBy 2018, four years after GIVE began, the shooting numbers still hadn\u2019t declined. The mayor\u2019s choice to replace his retiring police commissioner was a Buffalo Police Department veteran who had been on the job for more than 30 years, Byron Lockwood, a decision easily interpreted as a vote for the status quo. But Lockwood promptly abolished the strike-force unit, launched an ambitious community-policing program, and promoted Gramaglia, a strong GIVE supporter, to deputy commissioner.\n\nThat June, however, Malhotra and others sued the city over the use of highway checkpoints and traffic enforcement that fell disproportionately on minorities. The lawsuit is ongoing. The department, Malhotra says, still has further to go to repair relations in heavily policed nonwhite neighborhoods. \u201cThere\u2019s a distinction between the formal approach and the reality of what\u2019s going on,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the ground, we haven\u2019t seen much change in police practices.\u201d By the end of 2018, homicides totaled 57, marking the city\u2019s worst year since 2014.\n\nIn response to Malhotra\u2019s criticisms, Gramaglia notes the emphasis that Lockwood has placed on his new community-policing program. Still, he concedes, \u201cit\u2019s a day-by-day process, and building bridges takes time.\u201d As for the violence-reduction strategies, Gramaglia\u2019s immersion in GIVE training\u2014which was informed by Abt\u2019s thinking\u2014made him feel confident about staying the course. \u201cWe\u2019re not foolish enough to think that we\u2019re not going to have spikes again,\u201d he says. Rather than abandoning the strategies the department had been using, Gramaglia decided instead to adjust them. Read: My family\u2019s gun wounds: A tale in three acts Alarmed by 2018\u2019s homicide surge, he knew one plausible solution was trying a heavier use of call-ins, a form of focused deterrence in which likely shooters and victims get summoned to a group sit-down with cops and social workers. Those interventions target parolees and probationers, using readily available lists of men likely to comply with orders to show up. But targeting those who have already been convicted of crimes misses those who have no criminal record. At a GIVE-sponsored seminar in October, Gramaglia was struck by an idea while hearing talk of making home visits\u2014essentially the same intervention as a group call-in, but with a single high-risk person. Targeting Facebook gun flashers and men suspected of having gang affiliations could reach the young men and teens who lacked criminal records and who were driving much of the violence. Gramaglia\u2019s officers had tried this tactic sporadically already and saw it as promising. \u201cThey fully expect to be shot,\u201d he says of the youths they visit. So the mission is \u201cto go there and try to help you and show you a better way.\u201d\n\nStarting in November, Gramaglia streamlined the process into initial police-only visits, which open the door, if possible, to a more formal group visit with social workers on hand. \u201cThe end game is no violence,\u201d he says. \u201cA real win is we get you to be a productive member of society. We get you a job, we get you back in school, we get you on the right path.\u201d But Gramaglia will settle for those youths falling off the police radar. \u201cWhich means you\u2019re not out shooting anybody. You\u2019re not out carrying a gun.\u201d Green, who oversees the GIVE program statewide, makes the case that cities such as Buffalo with chronic violence problems need patience. \u201cWe try not to put too much emphasis on one year\u2019s numbers,\u201d he explains. In Buffalo, he says, \u201cI see very promising things that are moving in a direction steadily over time that I think bodes very well.\u201d Using a new program for six months or a year is one thing, he says. \u201cIt gets harder to sustain and incorporate into your way of doing business over a period of time. I think Buffalo\u2019s done a nice job with that.\u201d\n\nAbt believes that one reason so many cities fail at violence prevention is that they lurch from crisis to crisis, pulling solutions from the air and then trying something else after the next inevitable surge in violence. In Chicago, the birthplace of the Cure Violence street-outreach program, a series of public-funding lapses from 2004 to 2015 interrupted the program, capped by a complete loss of state funding from 2015 to 2017. The organization closed all but one of its offices during what turned out to be a nationwide spike in gun violence, led by Chicago.\n\nWhile Abt generally eschews the political debate about gun control, he does see evidence for limiting the supply of guns through laws requiring permits to purchase handguns. In 2007, though, legislators abolished Missouri\u2019s 86-year-old permit law, a move that has been blamed for helping lead to a 27 percent increase in firearm homicide rates in St. Louis, the state\u2019s most violent city. In Los Angeles, complaints about racially biased enforcement tactics forced the city this year to scrap a data program it had used since 2011 to target its hot-spots-policing work. Read: Do algorithms have a place in policing? The crime-control theorist who devised the focused-deterrence strategy, David Kennedy, filled his memoir with tales of frustration when cities prematurely pulled the plug on the strategy due to political or bureaucratic squabbles. Even in the strategy\u2019s birthplace, Boston, where it was credited with reversing horrific youth-violence rates, Kennedy\u2019s Operation Ceasefire lasted only four years, a victim of a turf battle among Boston police leaders. In other cases, cities improvised changes to the strategy that undercut its effectiveness, or simply panicked when street violence flared. \u201cI know we can control the bad guys,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cThe bad guys are not the problem. I don\u2019t know how to control the good guys.\u201d There are numerous other barriers to achieving widespread, consistent use of the best strategies. Much research remains locked inside scholarly papers that defy easy translation into an action plan by officers on the ground\u2014many of whom see policing as an art, not a science. In surveys in the police departments of Sacramento and Richmond, Virginia, only a quarter of officers said they\u2019d heard of evidence-based policing. \u201cA lot of cops think research is Google,\u201d says Mitchell, of the American Society of Evidence-Based Policing.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s spending priorities have leaned more on George W. Bush\u2013era tough-on-crime programs, while axing a number of Obama-era prevention-focused programs, including Abt\u2019s youth-violence initiative. Abt faults all of these barriers for the slow progress of evidence-based practices in violence prevention. But he sees an underlying cause as well: a lack of political will to help those threatened the most in the remaining pockets of gun violence. \u201cViolence concentrates among the least politically powerful among us\u2014poor communities of color.\u201d GIVE had barely begun in 2014 when Abt left the running of it to Green\u2019s staff and moved to his current job, as a senior research fellow at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School. The GIVE experience had shown him that it was possible to steer troubled cities toward evidence-based strategies and teach them to use the strategies effectively. But after a decade of work aimed at spreading this science, Abt still wasn\u2019t seeing widespread adoption. Abt had been fond of reciting a criminology truism, \u201cWe know what works.\u201d Then it hit him: \u201cWho is this \u2018we\u2019?\u201d he said he wondered. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a very small number of people \u2026 I realized that we had sort of been talking to ourselves.\u201d This nagging concern, and research he did at Harvard documenting how evidence of effective violence prevention had grown to more than 1,400 studies, led Abt to start work three years ago on what would become Bleeding Out. This book, he decided, should take a starkly different tone than the piles of research papers that had largely gone ignored. With a blunt title focused on everyday urban violence\u2014\u201cFirst you stop the bleeding, because unless you stop the bleeding, nothing else matters,\u201d he writes\u2014Abt prescribes specific strategies, complete with forecasts of what they will cost and how many lives can be saved.\n\nAbt suggests a dozen different evidence-based approaches, including the popular ones used by New York\u2019s GIVE program. He also recommends a concerted effort to solve more homicides, and various family and substance-abuse therapies. The interventions are geared toward the particulars of a potentially violent situation. For example, teenagers at potential but not imminent risk of harming others can be reached through a preventive measure such as cognitive behavioral therapy. As someone\u2019s risk level goes up, he might be in need of the violence interrupters who work in street outreach, a focused deterrence intervention, or even incarceration. Read: What\u2019s the solution to gun violence in America? Abt does the math for the 40 U.S. cities that together have the worst homicide rates and numbers of killings. If these cities adopted his plan, at a combined cost of $900 million over eight years, he claims, more than 12,000 lives would be saved. Chicago, which has consistently had more murders than any other U.S. city in recent years, would save 1,500 lives using programs costing $112 million over eight years. (A Chicago police spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, bristles at the suggestion that the city ignores evidence-based strategies, saying it has done \u201csome of the most advanced work\u201d in the nation and has lower homicide numbers since 2017 to show for it.) Nationwide, Abt estimates that the investment would pay off not just in lives but in costs avoided: $120 billion in medical expenses, criminal-justice costs, lost wages, and reduced quality of life.\n\nAbt advocates for progressive ideas such as limiting or excluding the involvement of police when using street-outreach counselors. But he also bucks the dogma of the left that crime\u2019s principal root cause\u2014poverty\u2014must be made the priority, and that policing needs curtailment instead of reform. \u201cViolence is not simply a manifestation of poverty; it is a force that perpetuates poverty as well,\u201d he writes. \u201cPoverty might precede violence, but reducing poverty requires working backward, beginning with violence itself.\u201d Such notions, says Jeffrey Butts, the director of the Research and Evaluation Center at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, may skew the violence-intervention focus too far into short-term preventive tactics driven by law enforcement. \u201cHe claims the moral high ground by dismissing people who talk about fundamental causes and long-term solutions,\u201d says Butts. He adds that Abt\u2019s use of numbers shows an \u201caggressively overconfident\u201d precision that can give people a false impression of how likely these outcomes are. Butts also questions Abt\u2019s theory that a book can bridge the gap between researchers and practitioners where other tools haven\u2019t worked. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to change someone\u2019s behavior just by telling them stuff,\u201d he says. Abt said he\u2019s all for addressing social and economic root causes of violence, so long as they don\u2019t substitute for \u201clife-saving policies that can be implemented today.\u201d He also said he was careful to label his numbers on projected lives saved and costs as estimates, and called them conservative estimates at that.\n\nBecause the book is aimed not just at policy makers and police but also at the general public, its accessibility gives it an advantage, says the Harvard sociologist Christopher Winship, who has worked closely with Abt and on violence-reduction research of his own. Once citizens read it, he says, \u201care they calling up the local police department, the chief, and saying, \u2018How come you\u2019re not doing this?\u2019 That seems to me to be where the book potentially has some real leverage.\u201d After Gramaglia\u2019s epiphany in the fall, Buffalo police greatly expanded their use of home visits. In the first half of 2019, they attempted the tactic 241 times, compared with 10 and 15 times in the same period of 2017 and 2018, respectively. Any social scientist would caution against drawing a causal inference about whether it has worked, especially with so many other overlapping efforts in play. But a notable drop in shootings in 2019 signals that something crucial has changed. Citywide, the number of shooting victims fell by nearly one-third from the same six months in 2018: to 78 from 115. In the two patrol districts that see the majority of Buffalo\u2019s shootings and where GIVE concentrates its work, the drop in shooting victims has been about 40 percent.\n\nIn the case of Clark, the young man whom Lieutenant Thomas\u2019s GIVE team visited hours after he was almost shot, the outcome in the weeks after the meeting turned into an encapsulation of the potential, and frustrations, of trying to police in a different way in a place where community trust is frayed.", "description": "Why aren\u2019t more cities using it?", "authors": ["Mark Obbie", "Photography Tony Luong"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/buffalo_lead_comp/facebook.jpg?1567542415", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
