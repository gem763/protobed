The Apple Watch is the best smartwatch available today and the latest band offering comes to us from the fine folks at Pad & Quill.\n\nThe Pad & Quill Lowry Cuff Edition band is available now for just $84.96, which is a pretty great deal considering all the American full-grain leather that is incorporated into the three-piece band. While I tested out the Chestnut color with polished nickel hardware, you can also choose Galloper Black and Whisky color leather with Matte Black hardware as an option.\n\nThe band arrived in an attractive box that slid open to reveal the band.", "description": "There are some extremely expensive cuff style bands for the Apple Watch, but thankfully the folks at Pad & Quill offer an affordable, exquisitely constructed handmade leather option for less than $100. This new Edition one improves upon its previous Lowry Cuff model too.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/30/6a81a1ba-4f58-4857-8980-fb5a6781b92b/thumbnail/770x578/6f8bb84ef198d5b5315282c3420e64cd/padquill-lowry-cuff-aw-6.jpg"}
