If you think nothing is wrong with your misbehavior so in this area then announce it to your wife and family.\"\n\nIn his first extensive comments since the story broke, Bob told Kantor and Twohey that he \"surrendered\" in his attempts to intervene in his brother's abuse. Due to his own struggle with substance abuse, he concluded that Harvey had a sex addiction, but \"got worn out\" of trying to stop him.\n\nProducer Harvey Weinstein and actress Jennifer Lawrence speak onstage during the 24th Annual GLAAD Media Awards at JW Marriott Los Angeles at L.A.

Chiu told Kantor and Twohey that she struggled with depression and attempted to commit suicide in the 20 years where she stayed silent, not even telling her husband about the abuse, due to a restrictive non-disclosure agreement.\n\nThe book also explains the process of working with sources like actress Gwyneth Paltrow, how lawyers like prominent victims' rights attorney Gloria Allred profited from negotiating settlements for Harvey's accusers, and how campaigns to silence high-profile accusers like Rose McGowan were orchestrated.\n\nKantor and Twohey's reporting is credited with sparking the #MeToo movement, and the book includes interviews with the movement's prominent figures, including Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who testified that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her.\n\nThe book is set for release on September 10.", "description": "A book from the New York Times journalists who broke the Harvey Weinstein story contains a letter from his brother about his 'misbehavior.'", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d75334721214c798402efac-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
