However this led some to accuse her of being drunk.\n\nSpeaking on Loose Women today, she said: \"It's a little bit sad, to be honest, because I got to many messages saying, 'Oh she's drunk, BBC should fire her'.\"\n\nShe also addressed rumours of a rift between her and Neil and said that \"dancing brought them together\".\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\"People want me to slip up,\" she told the panelists and revealed that when she literally slipped on the dance floor she was accused of being \"drunk\".\n\nAsked how she felt about Neil finally having a partner, she said: \"Oh my god, so excited - finally!\n\n\"He's got all the credentials, he's the world champion and he's just brilliant. I'm so happy for him. I think him and Alex are really good partners.\"\n\n*Loose Women airs weekdays at 12.30pm on ITV", "description": "The professional dancer, 30, said that viewers had called for the BBC to 'sack' her after claiming she was 'drunk' by falling over", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584802.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Loose-Women-TV-show-London-UK-15-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
