But Solomon said the landscape has become more challenging given privacy regulations and especially updated browsers that place new limits on the types of cookies that can be used to track users.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been an explosion of first-party cookies,\u201d Solomon said, referring to cookies that are stored on the domain you\u2019re actually visiting (as opposed to third-party cookies, which are increasingly blocked).\n\nHe argued that these \u201cshort-lived\u201d cookies then create problems for publishers: \u201cIf you\u2019re in Safari visiting the same site every day, a new ID could be generated\u201d each day. So Cartographer deals with this by using data science and machine learning to attempt to \u201ccluster\u201d different IDs together that likely belong to the same user.\n\n\u201cEvery day when we see an ID, we\u2019ll capture it,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cWe\u2019re graphing those cookies together, these dozens or hundreds of cookies that we believe, based on our technology, that these cookies belong to the same individual.\u201d\n\nHe also said that connecting IDs in this way is crucial to the whole \u201cRussian nesting doll\u201d of how a publisher or advertiser understands identity on the internet: \u201cCookies ladder up to devices, devices ladder up to people, people ladder up to households.\u201d So by connecting cookies to people, Lotame can also offer better household-level data.\n\nAnd far from being an attempt to circumvent privacy restrictions, Solomon argued that Cartographer actually makes it easier for publishers to stay compliant with Europe\u2019s GDPR and California\u2019s CCPA rules, because they can do a better job of storing a customer\u2019s privacy preferences.\n\nGrant Whitmore, chief digital officer at Lotame customer Tribune Publications, made a similar point: \u201cOne of the things that I think all publishers are wrestling with right now is really the disconnect that is occurring in the adtech landscape and the legislative landscape and really managing the persistence of that consent.\u201d\n\nWhitmore continued, \u201cOne of the unintended consequences of that legislation and some of what is happening in the browser space is that we could be forced into a position where we are having to ask you every single time you visit a site whether it\u2019s okay to sell your data, whether it\u2019s okay to track.\u201d\n\nAnd he said that\u2019s one of the big reasons Tribune is deploying Cartographer across all its properties, including its nine core newspaper sites. Though he acknowledged that it\u2019s more broadly useful too.\n\n\u201cFrom the standpoint of our core business, getting a more complete picture of who a user is across these device types \u2026 That is of ongoing importance to us,\u201d Whitmore said. \u201cAs we fight in this very competitive landscape, our ability to bring our understanding of who a user is, what their interests are \u2026 and providing good solutions \u2014 whether on the advertising front or whether that\u2019s handling digital subscription offers \u2014 is just table stakes at this point.\u201d\n\nSolomon, meanwhile, said that Cartographer\u2019s benefits go beyond \u201cjust figuring which IDs cluster together to represent an individual,\u201d because it\u2019s also ensuring that there\u2019s proper ID synchronization with other data and ad-buying platforms.\n\n\u201cWe make sure there\u2019s maximum connectivity, maximum dial tone, with all the ecosystem participants,\u201d he said.", "description": "Lotame, a company offering data management tools for publishers and marketers, today unveiled a new product called Cartographer\u00a0\u2014 described by CMO Adam Solomon as \u201cour new people-based ID solution.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s Lotame\u2019s offering to help businesses connect their visitor and customer data across platforms and devices.
