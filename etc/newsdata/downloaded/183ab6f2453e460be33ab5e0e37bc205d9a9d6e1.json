Anyone with military personnel in his or her family knows that their loved one has solemnly sworn to \u201csupport and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic,\u201d to \u201cbear true faith and allegiance to the same,\u201d and to \u201cobey the orders of the president of the United States\u201d and the officers appointed over him or her, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\nThis is a sacred oath, dating to the Revolutionary War and the founding of our nation. That\u2019s why last week\u2019s news that the Trump administration was changing the way children of military personnel could become U.S. citizens set off a firestorm, not just among the military community but across the nation.\n\nIn addition to his policy of no longer accepting transgender people in the U.S. military, due to the \"burden\" it puts upon our armed forces, and kicking out highly skilled and greatly needed foreign recruits, President Donald Trump recently took aim at the children of the thousands of immigrants currently serving in the U.S. military.\n\nEach year, approximately 5,000 green-card holders who are legal immigrants but not yet citizens join the U.S. military. But in a policy change released on Aug. 28, the U.S. Citizens and Immigration Services announced that it was \"updating its policy regarding children of U.S. government employees and U.S. armed forces members employed or stationed outside the United States to explain that they are not considered to be 'residing in the United States' for purposes of acquiring citizenship.\"\n\nThe announcement goes on to explain that \"USCIS no longer considers children of U.S. government employees and U.S. armed forces members residing outside the United States as 'residing in the United States' for purposes of acquiring citizenship.\"\n\nGiven Trump\u2019s full-throated assault on birthright citizenship in the U.S., not just for unauthorized immigrants but authorized as well, it\u2019s no wonder the military community saw this as restricting their children\u2019s path to citizenship.\n\nAs we wrote in an editorial last year, Trump has called birthright citizenship, which is provided for in the post-Civil War 14th Amendment and can be repealed only through a constitutional amendment or act of Congress, a \"crazy, lunatic policy\" that encourages illegal immigration and has \"created an entire industry of birth tourism.\" Not surprisingly, last week's announcement was seen by reasonable people on the left and the right as a needless and alarming affront to those who have taken the oath to serve in our armed forces and defend our way our life. The conservative Heritage Foundation, for example, labeled the Trump administration's announcement a \"fiasco\" and a perfect example of \"how not to roll out a policy.\"\n\nAlmost immediately, the U.S. Citizens and Immigration Services began to \"clarify\" and walk back the policy change, claiming it was a \"mundane\" change. Indeed, USCIS acting director Ken Cuccinelli released a statement the same day, saying: \"This policy update does not affect who is born a U.S. citizen, period. This only affects children who were born outside the United States and were not U.S. citizens. This does NOT impact birthright citizenship. This policy update does not deny citizenship to the children of U.S. government employees or members of the military born abroad.\"\n\nForgive us if we\u2019re not buying Cuccinelli\u2019s line. There is nothing mundane about denying the children of military green-card holders a clear and straightforward path to U.S. citizenship, regardless of whether they were born in Japan, Germany, Qatar, Fort Hood, Texas, or any other military posting. The U.S. military has, since the inception of this great nation, been an honorable path for foreign-born individuals to attain U.S. citizenship. By definition these noncitizen military personnel, many of whom are stationed overseas on foreign soil for long periods of time, have \u201cchildren who were born outside the United States.\u201d\n\nIn short, it wasn't just the rollout of the new policy that was a fiasco. The problem rests with the policy itself. Many have rightly seen it as clamping down not only on \u201cillegal\u201d immigration, but also restricting long-established, legal pathways to U.S. citizenship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a man or woman is willing to put his life on the line for this nation they \u2014 and their children, regardless of where they happen to be stationed \u2014 we should be honored to call them fellow citizens. When someone gives the government a blank check on their lives to \u201csupport and defend the Constitution of the United States,\u201d we should extend the courtesy and allow them and their children to live under that Constitution.\n\nGot an opinion about this issue?
