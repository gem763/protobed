Photo: Courtesy of Netflix/Courtesy of Netflix\n\nCriminal profiler John Douglas isn\u2019t exactly a household name, but his work has influenced a vast amount of pop culture from Silence of the Lambs to Netflix\u2019s Mindhunter. As the real-life inspiration behind Mindhunter\u2019s main character, Holden Ford (played by Jonathan Groff), Douglas was a founder of the FBI\u2019s Behavioral Science Unit and one of the first agents to interview serial killers in an attempt to better understand future predators.\n\nThough retired from the FBI since 1996, Douglas continues to work on cases and has written several books about criminal profiling \u2014 his latest, co-written by Mark Olshaker, is The Killer Across the Table \u2014 and he lends a knowledgeable hand to TV shows and movies that aren\u2019t, as he puts it, solely about \u201cblood and gore.\u201d (He\u2019s even developing a podcast based on his original Mindhunter book.) Now, the Netflix drama inspired by one of those books has revisited one of the more controversial chapters of his career: the Atlanta child murders. Though a man named Wayne Williams was convicted in 1982 for two murders tied to the case, Douglas doubts that Williams is responsible for many of the other 26 killings \u2014 despite matching a profile that Douglas himself made when he began investigating the case in the \u201980s \u2014 and Atlanta police officially reopened the case last March.\n\nVulture sat down with Douglas to chat about the fact and fiction of Mindhunter, the Atlanta child killings, the most notable interviews of his career, and why he wants Netflix to keep renewing the show until Ford finally catches the BTK killer.\n\nThis season, I felt like I saw more of you in Bill Tench than Holden Ford. What did you think?\n\nYou\u2019re right! You know when Holden is getting chewed out at the retirement party? If it\u2019s just me, this person that\u2019s superior to me in rank, and no one\u2019s around, I\u2019m not going to take it. You\u2019re going to call me a twerp? No, you\u2019re not going to get away with that. I never challenged a person I was interviewing, either. I would never call Manson \u201cyou little shit\u201d or whatever the hell term was used. No, I stroked his ego. I let him feel like he was in control of the interview.\n\nWhat was it like to speak to Charles Manson?\n\nWe actually went back a couple of times to interview Manson. He did take the sunglasses. He wanted to show everyone that he ripped us off because everyone would know that he was talking to the FBI. [Mimicking back and forth with Manson] \u201cI want those glasses.\u201d \u201cThese are Ray-Ban glasses. These are expensive!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got to take them back, man. I\u2019ve got to show everybody I ripped you off.\u201d So he took the glasses and he never gave them back! Unlike in the show.\n\nThe real John Douglas.

What did you think about the story line with Tench\u2019s son? Should we be worried about him?\n\nWell, it did not happen to the real guy Tench was representing, [Robert] Ressler, but that case does exist. It was up in San Francisco. A woman in a park with a 20-month-old toddler. Two brothers, 10 years old and 7 years old, snatch the child. They kill the child in the basement with a brick and then they attach a cross to the child, believing that the child\u2019s going to be resurrected. So that did happen.\n\nThe Atlanta child-murder case was one of the Behavior Science Unit\u2019s first huge investigations, and it plays a big role in Mindhunter. What can you tell me about the real case?\n\nThroughout the whole trial, all the months leading up to the apprehension, I would come and go because I had other work. By 1981, not only did I have the Atlanta child killings, but I had the Tylenol murders. We had the Unabomber case up in Chicago. Then we had other cases, Buffalo\u2019s .22-caliber killer.\n\nI did the written analysis of the case and people didn\u2019t like it. The FBI had me sit down and do an interview with People magazine. In the interview, I say the suspect is going to be black. I\u2019m back on the case down there, I walk into a task force and pretty much the entire force was African-American. Even the agent in charge of the FBI office, John Glover, was the first African-American agent in charge of an FBI office. He wasn\u2019t introduced at all in the show. And so, I wasn\u2019t warmly welcomed.\n\nThey were afraid that I was going to create a race war. I remember walking down to one of the crime scenes and a detective says, \u201cYou\u2019re Douglas?\u201d And I say, \u201cYeah.\u201d And he said, \u201cI saw your profile. It\u2019s a bunch of shit, man.\u201d I said, \u201cFuck you, man. I didn\u2019t ask to be here. I just want to go back to Quantico. I got a lot of cases waiting for me back there.\u201d\n\nTo me, the turning point in the case came when a guy called up the police saying that he was the killer. He\u2019s using the N-word, giving directions on where we can find another body. I hear the tape and I said, \u201cThat\u2019s not the killer. But we got to catch him because if we don\u2019t, he\u2019s going to be bothering the hell out of this investigation.\u201d What do we do? We\u2019re gonna show how stupid we really are. Lo and behold, the guy calls in, \u201cYou dumb-asses, I told you to search this side of the street. You searched the other!\u201d We traced the call and caught him. What\u2019s the significance? Well, that ended up in the newspapers in Atlanta. And who read it? The killer. Within a day or so, we end up with a body on Sigman Road. Now, for certain, we know they follow the press.\n\nThe crosses they used for the memorial were a real suggestion I had, too. It was true that the Bureau was arguing among themselves who\u2019s going to make the crosses. They went back and forth. It was never done. That\u2019s why, after a while, I would do things without asking for permission. Just asking for forgiveness if I screwed up.\n\nThe scene where they build the crosses never happened?\n\nNo, never got to them! I have several things that I wanted to do. The big Sammy Davis Jr. and Frank Sinatra concert, I knew the unknown subject was going to be in that audience. So I said, \u201cLet\u2019s look for somebody who has some type of security background who has a vehicle. We can screen them right away. We can get rid of all the females. We\u2019ll get rid of people who don\u2019t have cars. We can eliminate through race.\u201d Again, it was a great idea. It wasn\u2019t used. We know later on that Williams was at that concert.\n\nOh my God.\n\nYeah, they wonder why I drink. [Laughs.]\n\nDo you think the right man was caught? The Atlanta police reopened the case earlier this year.\n\nI never thought that Wayne Williams did all of those cases. There are other cases that should not be on the list. Two of the girls, Angela Lanier and Latonya Wilson, and some other ones that did not fit. Roy Hazelwood [another FBI profiler] and I had about ten of them that we thought were behaviorally linked. Now they are looking at it again. It\u2019s not that [Williams] didn\u2019t do any [of the murders]. But it\u2019s the question, did he do all 28 of them?\n\nIf investigators contacted you, would you help out on the reopened case?\n\nI definitely would go back.\n\nMindhunter is also slowly unraveling the BTK case. How frustrating was the actual investigation? You started getting information on him in the \u201980s, right? He wasn\u2019t caught until 2005.\n\nDennis Rader, he wasn\u2019t any genius. He was just very lucky. In 1984, we said he was a police-buff type, attending college and probably in criminal justice. He was. He was a pseudo\u2013enforcement officer. You see that and you think, Gee, had they just maybe gone over there \u2026 It was really the stupidity of Rader that got him caught, unfortunately. It wasn\u2019t because of super-duper police work. He wasn\u2019t smart like Ed Kemper. He was more on the lines of David Berkowitz, the same kind of average IQ.\n\nI hope the show sticks with the BTK case because I want to see Ford and Tench catch him.\n\nThey\u2019ll have to speed up on it because he gets caught after I retired. But they got some other great cases. From Ted Bundy, John Gacy, Robert Hansen, the Alaskan serial killer who hunted women down like wild animals after setting them loose up in the mountains. The Green River murder case that nearly did me in. Also, I interviewed assassins. Besides Squeaky Fromme and Arthur Bremer, we did Sirhan Sirhan, Sarah Jane Moore who shot at Ford along with Squeaky Fromme. So you can even get into some of the assassination types. It\u2019s just how long they want to take it. It can go a long, long time, really.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked to so many infamous criminals over the years. Was there ever a killer you were excited \u2014 for lack of a better word \u2014 to interview?\n\nI don\u2019t know if \u201cexcited\u201d is the right word, but I was fascinated by the worst ones. Gary Heidnik in Philadelphia, who inspired Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs \u2014 I did an analysis because I assisted the prosecution. We knew he was going to claim that he was insane. He did do some insane acts \u2014 like imprison and torture half a dozen women by keeping them in a pit with water in it, by putting an electric current on the shackles around their wrists \u2014 but he was not insane. When you look at the crime scene, the victims were kept in the cellar, with various concrete blocks around the window so no one could hear any screaming. His crimes were certainly insane, but he knew right from wrong.\n\nAnother one was Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris out in California. My God, these guys raped and killed a half-dozen women, young teenagers, playing audiotape as they tortured them. I have the tapes of these victims who are begging for their lives. I made Scott Glenn of Silence of the Lambs, who portrayed me, listen to them when he came to my office. He got all emotional and said, \u201cJohn, I was against the death penalty, but I didn\u2019t know there are people like that.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s end on a lighter question. In Mindhunter this season, Holden says that he likes New Wave music. Are you actually a New Wave fan?\n\nNo, I like soul music. Right now in my car, Sirius, I got the soul channel. But not the spiritual soul. I used to watch Soul Train after school. I\u2019d be down in the basement with a black-and-white TV, learning the latest moves.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "description": "Criminal profiling pioneer and former FBI agent John Douglas inspired Netflix\u2019s Mindhunter.
