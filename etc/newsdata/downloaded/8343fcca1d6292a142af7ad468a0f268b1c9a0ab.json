(Jonas Gustavsson/MCV Photo for The Washington Post)\n\nPARIS \u2014 The dissonance is striking. The constant stream of political news telling us that we, the people, have failed because we cannot govern ourselves without cleaving in two, without crumbling into bits, without erupting in a firestorm. And here, on the runway, we are told of beginnings and renewal, of transformation and the simple pleasure of doing one\u2019s best.\n\nHere is designer Junya Watanabe wanting only to apply his skill to making beautiful, relevant clothes. He began with a trench coat, and he deconstructed it in seemingly a thousand different ways. It became skirts and cargo pants, dresses and corsets and coats. He layered these pieces over leggings printed with the original artwork from Brazilian duo Bicicleta Sem Freio and a Spanish graffiti artist who goes by Demsky J.\n\nAnd that was that. A delightful collection of interesting ideas expertly executed.\n\n\n\nJunya Watanabe spring-summer 2020 collection.

(Jonas Gustavsson/MCV Photo for The Washington Post)\n\nBut where Watanabe offered pure fashion, Kei Ninomiya made an emotional appeal. It\u2019s impossible not to consider the environment and climate change when looking at Ninomiya\u2019s spring 2020 Noir collection. He called the collection he put on the runway Saturday afternoon \u201cBeginning,\u201d and it focused on the energy that comes from starting something new. So there were ferns and succulents sprouting from the magnificent plant crowns and headpieces created for the occasion by Azuma Makoto, a Japanese flower artist. The models walked down the runway like human topiaries, the sounds of leaves brushing against their legs and rustling from their strides.\n\n\n\nNoir by Kei Ninomiya spring-summer 2020 collection.

(Jonas Gustavsson/MCV Photo for The Washington Post)\n\nSometimes the plants appeared to be covering black blazers and trousers, as if some business hack was overgrown by nature, the same way the ruins of a lost civilization are reclaimed by the environment. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.\n\nHe sometimes covers the face with mossy masks, and it can be jarring. It\u2019s easy to understand why some might take offense at the notion of covering a woman\u2019s face and making her anonymous. Of silencing her. In the context of his presentation, his decision comes as a suggestion: Perhaps we should refrain from focusing so much on us, on our individual needs and desires, and consider ourselves as part of an interconnected environment. We are part of the biodiversity, and we are not immune to extinction.\n\nNinomiya reminds his audience of the precariousness of nature in the jolting appearance of a woman in slick, lacquered black detritus. She is a shimmering junk heap out of which a few sprigs of life grow. She is our haunting future. Is that bit of green a sign of life springing forth? Or the last gasp of joy?\n\n\n\nNoir by Kei Ninomiya spring-summer 2020 collection. (Jonas Gustavsson/MCV Photo for The Washington Post)\n\nThere is a choice, of course. We can choose to stand in the darkness or to move into the light. We can see our world as something beyond a suburban cul-de-sac or an urban mews. Or we can be small and petty. A single blade of grass doesn\u2019t last long. Ninomiya suggests that we can start over \u2014 or at least start the day with fresh thoughts, new ideas \u2026 hope.\n\nCan fashion designers teach us something about growth? They are, after all, masters of the art of change. They understand that we are forever tweaking our identity, searching for new ways to express our personality. Designer Rei Kawakubo has taken on the grand topic of human identity in creating costumes for a new opera, \u201cOrlando,\u201d by composer Olga Neuwirth, which is expected to debut in Vienna in December. The opera focuses on the idea of gender stereotypes and transformation.\n\n\n\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons spring-summer 2020 collection.

(Jonas Gustavsson/MCV Photo for The Washington Post)\n\nKawakubo began to explore these ideas in June during her Comme des Gar\u00e7ons menswear presentation that featured male models in pin-curls wearing ornamented blazers and trousers and dresses and skirts that were not particularly masculine nor especially feminine. Act II had her musing on femininity, romance and the self. On the runway Saturday evening, her ideas about gender were not relegated to one time or ethos. She speaks through brocades and ruffles, tapestries and what appears to be plain muslin.\n\nHer shapes are grand and imposing, and her ideas play out in a cacophony of color and textures. There are skirts that degrade into slim trousers, leggings stuffed with distorting padding and bloomers sized for a giant. The garments hearken to past centuries when the lines between gender were not so fixed, when men wore ruffles and silk stockings and everyone wore wigs and powdered their hair.\n\nThe final act is the opera itself. One suspects that will also be the moment when the beauty of these fascinating creations will come alive with emotion. That was the missing element Saturday evening, that mysterious, poetic something that tugs at your heart and gives Kawakubo\u2019s work its magic. Despite Stravinsky roaring on the soundtrack and the models gliding meditatively down the elevated runway, the show was a constrained, intellectual experience \u2014 the shapes are mesmerizing, the fabrication dynamic, the complexity inspiring \u2014 rather than an emotional one.\n\n\n\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons spring-summer 2020 collection.

(Jonas Gustavsson/MCV Photo for The Washington Post)\n\nBut perhaps Kawakubo knows our needs better than we ourselves know them. Perhaps emotion is the problem. People are making decisions with their gut, shooting from the hip and too often leading with their outrage. Perhaps now is, quite simply, the time to stop and think.\n\nMore from Paris Fashion Week:\n\nOlivier Rousteing said his Balmain collection was inspired by his millennial childhood. That\u2019s not fair to millennials.\n\nDesigner Rick Owens took on immigration, border walls and his own history. And it looked spectacular.\n\nWhy would anyone want Dior coveralls? Never mind, just enjoy its garden-themed Paris runway show.\n\nTwo legendary fashion designers came together and created something magical", "description": "Designers usually focus on how we want to look and feel.
