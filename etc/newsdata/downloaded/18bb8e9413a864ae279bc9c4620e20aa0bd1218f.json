of which 140,000 are almost entirely reliant on aid for survival.\n\nIn the event of an invasion of northern Syria by Turkey, Aleppo is where the majority of the initial fighting would take place.\n\nTurkey has announced plans to create a 'peace corridor' along its border with Syria by wiping out 'terrorists' - by which it means the SDF.\n\nAnkara says this will allow for the return of Syrian refugees in Turkey, and create greater regional stability.\n\nKurdish forces led the fight against ISIS with support from an international coalition headed by the US, but are now facing the prospect of having that support suddenly withdrawn\n\nFighters and veterans from the Kurdish women's protection units (YPJ) and the people's protection units (YPG) march in Qamishli, which is one of the targets for the Turkish assault\n\nThe Syrian government - which the US has attempted to topple - has called on the Kurds (pictured) to switch allegiance to their side if America withdraws its support\n\nThere are almost 600,000 displaced people in northern Syria currently receiving aid, with the majority of those around Aleppo where early fighting would take place\n\nHowever, observers warn fresh conflict along the border will destabilise the region and likely lead to an ISIS resurgence as the SDF diverts forces to fight the Turks.\n\nOvernight the SDF reported three suicide bomb attacks in Raqqa, the defacto capital of ISIS's self-declared Caliphate by sleeper cells which had activated in the city.\n\nEarly on Wednesday the group tweeted: 'Daesh takes advantage of Imminent Turkish invasion.\n\n'Three ISIS suicide bombings on our military positions in Raqqa, clashes still ongoing.'\n\nDaesh is a derogatory Arabic term for ISIS.\n\nTrump has faced a fierce political backlash after he agreed to withdraw US troops from Syria during a routine phone call with President Erdogan on Sunday.\n\nEfforts are now underway in Congress to block the troop withdrawal including from Senate Republicans led by Lindsay Graham.\n\nTweeting at Turkey's leadership on Tuesday night, he said: 'You do NOT have a green light to enter into northern Syria.\n\n'There is massive bipartisan opposition in Congress, which you should see as a red line you should not cross.'\n\nDonald Trump has denied abandoning the Kurds and has threatened to crash Turkey's economy in the event of 'unforced or unnecessary fighting'\n\nTurkish artillery batteries near the border with Syria are seen as the country prepares for an assault against Kurdish forces\n\nTurkish Army's armored military vehicles and heavy duty machines are being dispatched to the Syrian border ahead of Turkey's planned operation\n\nA truck carrying two armoured vehicles makes its way past a border crossing between Turkey and Syria overnight on Tuesday\n\nPresident Erdogan has outlined plans to create a 'peace corridor' in northern Syria in order to resettle some 2million refugees currently in Turkey\n\nOf particular concern are prison camps holding some 15,000 ISIS fighters that would fall into Turkey's hands if it seizes border areas that the SDF currently controls, including the notorious Al-Hawl camp.\n\nWithin these camps are 2,500 foreign ISIS jihadis, largely from Europe, which Turkey would then become responsible for detaining.\n\nThere are fears that this would give Ankara leverage over European leaders and security on the continent, since Turkey is one of the primary routes for ISIS fighters returning to Europe.\n\nTrump has attempted to defend his position by saying that he will crash the Turkish economy in the event of any 'unforced or unnecessary fighting'.\n\nHe also denied abandoning the Kurds, pointing out that the country has a large Kurdish population - including a separatist which the government has been fighting against for decades.\n\nTurkey wants to create what it calls a 'safe zone' in a stretch of territory along its southern border with Syria that is currently controlled by Syrian Kurdish fighters, known as the People's Protection Units, or YPG.\n\nTurkey considers the YPG as terrorists affiliated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has waged a 35-year-long battle against the Turkish state. Ankara also views the YPG-controlled zone as an 'existential threat.'\n\nErdogan has demanded a 'safe zone' that is 20 miles deep and stretches more than 300 miles toward the Iraqi border.\n\nSyrian National Army forces - a rebel group allied with Turkey - assembles its forces near Aleppo on Tuesday in preparation for an attack\n\nSyrian National Army forces are dispatched to Manbij front line ahead of Turkey's planned operation in the east of the Euphrates River\n\nThe SDF says all indication are that Turkey and its allies (including the Syrian National Army, pictured) are preparing for an attack against them\n\nThe Syrian National Army, component of Syrian opposition forces, held the military exercise in Afrin, Syria, near the border with Turkey, to support Turkish Armed Forces\n\nHe initially had hoped to do it in collaboration with the United States but grew frustrated with what he considered to be delaying tactics by the U.S.\n\nOnce secured, Turkey wants to resettle the area with 2 million Syrian refugees who fled to Turkey due to the conflict in their home country.\n\nHow such a massive resettlement would be carried out is unclear. Human rights groups have warned that any escalation of fighting in the area could displace hundreds of thousands more people.\n\nErdogan has spoken of plans to build towns, villages, hospitals and schools but also says Turkey, which has already spent some $40 billion on the refugees, cannot afford to do it alone.\n\nHe has said he will convene a donors conference to help meet the cost and has called on European nations to share the burden, warning that Turkey could be forced to open the 'gates' for an influx of migrants to Western nations.\n\nTurkey has carried out two previous incursions into northern Syria in recent years with the help of Syrian rebels.\n\nIn the first offensive in 2016, Turkey pushed back Islamic State group militants west of the Euphrates River.\n\nIn the second operation last year, Turkey captured the Syrian-Kurdish controlled enclave of Afrin.\n\nThose regions are currently administered by Turkish-backed opposition groups who run them as virtual Turkish-administered towns.\n\nAnalysts say this operation would likely be more complicated.\n\nThe SDF says ISIS has already launched three suicide attacks in Raqqa, the group's former capital, in expectation of a Turkish assault\n\nUnwilling to let go of an area they wrested from the Islamic State group, the battle-hardened Kurdish fighters - trained and equipped by the U.S. - have vowed to fight the Turks until the end.\n\n'It's a huge area for the Turkish military to go into and clearly there will be resistance on the part of the (Syrian Kurdish forces),' said Bulent Aliriza, of the director of the Turkey Project at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nAliriza suggested the operation may be a limited one that does not stretch all the way to the Iraqi border.\n\n'That's what we are going to look at first. How deep and how broad is it, whether it's all the way across from the Iraqi border to the Euphrates, or just limited to two or three penetration points,' he said.\n\nCritics of Trump's decision fear a Turkish operation could have destabilizing consequences for the region, while both Democrats and Republicans have warned that a Turkish attack could lead to a massacre of the Kurds, who are holding thousands of captured IS fighters and their families.\n\nOne of the big question marks surrounding Turkey's plans is whether fighting the Syrian Kurdish forces would allow IS to make a comeback.\n\nTurkey insists that the global battle against the militants won't suffer, and points to its 2016 incursion, which drove away IS from another border region.\n\nBut Kurdish officials have warned that they would have to divert their forces away from guarding IS prisoners in case of a Turkish assault.\n\nThe White House has said Turkey will take over responsibility for the imprisoned fighters, but it is unclear how that would happen, if it all.\n\nErdogan says Turkey and the United States are working separately on plans to repatriate foreign fighters held in Kurdish prisons.", "description": "Commanders of the Kudish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said 'thousands of innocent civilians' will die if Turkey attacks its forces in northern Syria, amid signs the assault will start today.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/08/19479192-0-image-a-23_1570605222195.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
