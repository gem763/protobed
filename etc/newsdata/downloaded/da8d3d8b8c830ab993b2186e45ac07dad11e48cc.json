Give it to us straight. Death for treasonous Trump; really?\n\nGo big or go home, as they say.\n\nThe good news is maybe the snore-fest called Impeachment has ended, and we\u2019ve moved on a bit to something different.\n\nThe bad news? Well, the bad news is that the thing we\u2019ve moved on to is calling for this president\u2019s death.\n\nRemember the days when political differences didn\u2019t have to end in death? Ahh, good times. Golden times.\n\nAnyhow, Weld said this, on MSNBC, while talking about the Ukraine thing \u2014 you know, the Ukraine Collusion Call involving Hunter Biden: \u201cTalk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election, it couldn\u2019t be clearer. And that\u2019s not just undermining democratic institutions, that is treason. It\u2019s treason, pure and simple,\u201d Weld said, Mediaite reported.\n\nPure. And. Simple.\n\nIndeed.\n\n\u201cAnd the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death,\u201d Weld went on. \u201cThat\u2019s the only penalty.\u201d\n\nYep. Death. Do not pass go. Death. And like a good puppet obeying the string-puller, MSNBC\u2019s Elise Jordan pressed for details: \u201cYou said that Donald Trump has committed treason and the penalty for treason under American law is death. \u2026 Have you looked into this? What \u2014 how do you see this proceeding?\u201d\n\nCan it be done today? Tomorrow? Shall I call Texas and see if there\u2019s an electric chair available this week?\n\nWeld: \u201cWell, the legal framework is under the U.S. criminal code. The only penalty for treason is death. \u2026 He\u2019s such a lawless man.\u201d\n\nThank goodness Weld is a Massachusetts Republican, which means, as any good Bay Stater knows, he\u2019s really a Democrat \u2014 and that means he really doesn\u2019t stand a chance to seize Trump\u2019s GOP thunder. Or Trump\u2019s GOP ticket. Or gain any political steam at all, outside his own cranberry-eating RINO select circle of a few, that is.\n\nOr else Trump\u2019s head on a platter, as envisioned by not-so-funny comedian Kathy Griffin back in 2017, might become a real thing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got treason,\u201d Weld said, Mediaite reported. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have to dribble around the court. We can go right for the hoop. It\u2019s well past time for this guy, in my opinion, to be carted off to save us all. He\u2019s daring us all to let him be totally lawless.\u201d\n\nYep. \u2018Cause basketball makes a great analogy for talking about putting to death a president.\n\nWay to go, Weld.\n\nHe may not be the Republican pick for president. He may not ever make it above 5 percent in the polls for challengers against Trump. But he will hold the historical record for something very, very significant \u2014 for something that just a few days ago, would\u2019ve been considered undoable, unthinkable, unattainable.\n\nWeld will be remembered in political books as the guy who made Rep. Maxine Waters appear sane.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
