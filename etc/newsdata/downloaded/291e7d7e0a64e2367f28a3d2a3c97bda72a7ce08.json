A U.N. report has called for Prince Mohammed and other senior Saudi officials to be investigated.\n\nThe CIA and some Western governments have said they believe the prince ordered the operation, an assertion Saudi officials have repeatedly denied.\n\nKhashoggi, a Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist, had become a prominent critic of the crown prince's policies.\n\nHe was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, where he was to receive papers ahead of his wedding. His body was dismembered and removed from the building, according to Turkish officials, and his remains have not been found.\n\nIn an article for the Post, Erdogan said the fact that the killers traveled on diplomatic passports and \"turned a diplomatic building into a crime scene\" set a dangerous precedent.\n\n\"Perhaps more dangerous is the impunity that some of the killers seem to enjoy back in the kingdom,\" he wrote, adding that there was a near-complete lack of transparency on the court proceedings.\n\nErdogan said Turkey continued to see Saudi Arabia as a friend and ally, but that did not mean Ankara would remain silent.\n\n\"The 15-member assassination squad that murdered Khashoggi inside Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul and chopped his body into pieces served the interests of a shadow state within the kingdom's government,\" Erdogan said, without elaborating.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Dominic Evans, Editing by William Maclean)", "description": "President Tayyip Erdogan insisted on Monday that Turkey will keep pushing for the truth behind the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year, saying some of his killers appeared to be evading justice.
