They can\u2019t help it,\u201d Trump told reporters when asked about those officials staying or hosting events at his properties, thus funneling money directly into his personal coffers.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments come a day after Pence came under intense public scrutiny for spending taxpayer money to stay at the Trump resort in Doonbeg, Ireland, this week despite the property being three hours away from his official meetings in Dublin.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that he wasn\u2019t involved in Pence\u2019s decision contradicts a Tuesday statement from Pence\u2019s chief of staff that Trump made the lodging suggestion. But the vice president\u2019s team offered a different explanation later that night, saying it was \u201csolely\u201d a decision by Pence\u2019s office so that he could enjoy a visit to his ancestral hometown.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments Wednesday also mark the first time he distanced himself from Barr\u2019s use of a Trump Organization property. Last week, The Washington Post reported that Barr had booked a $30,000 family holiday party at Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington. A Justice Department spokesperson said Barr was paying for the event out of his own pocket and only chose the venue because others were booked. However, the news reignited concern that the attorney general\u2019s allegiances lie with the president, not the country.\n\nQuestions about ways Trump is financially benefiting from the presidency have been a constant throughout his time in office. Currently, the Justice Department is defending his Washington hotel against a lawsuit filed by nearly 200 members of Congress accusing Trump of violating the Constitution\u2019s anti-corruption emoluments clause by profiting from his businesses while in office.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nWilliam Barr Books $30,000 Party At Trump Hotel: Report\n\nDemocrats To Investigate Trump's Plan To Host Next G-7 Summit At His Miami Golf Course\n\nMike Pence Goes 3 Hours Out Of His Way To Stay At Trump's Irish Golf Resort\n\nLove HuffPost?
