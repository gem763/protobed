REUTERS/Raysa Campos Leite/File Photo\n\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Vice President Hamilton Mour\u00e3o will be Brazil\u2019s acting president through Thursday while President Jair Bolsonaro recovers from abdominal surgery resulting from his stabbing at a political rally last year, his spokesman said on Sunday.\n\nBolsonaro was stable after a successful five-hour surgery, the presidential palace said in a statement.\n\nSunday\u2019s surgery was to correct an incisional hernia due to a weakening of certain tissues from three previous surgeries in the president\u2019s abdomen after he was stabbed in September 2018.\n\nPresidential Spokesman General Ot\u00e1vio Barros told a news conference Mour\u00e3o, a former army general, would act as president for five days starting on Sunday.\n\nChief Surgeon Ant\u00f4nio Macedo told reporters he expects Bolsonaro to be able to travel from S\u00e3o Paulo to the capital Bras\u00edlia in a week to 10 days. An incisional hernia is a protrusion of tissue that forms at the site of a healing surgical scar.\n\nBolsonaro, 64, wrote on Twitter on Saturday night before the surgery: \u201cI remain confident for the next surgery. May God bless us. Good night.\u201d He tweeted after taking part in festivities to mark Brazil\u2019s 197th Independence Day in Bras\u00edlia.\n\nAd\u00e9lio Bispo de Oliveira, the man accused of attacking Bolsonaro, was acquitted after a judge in Minas Gerais ruled he was mentally ill. In a decision handed down in June, the court ordered his detention in a mental illness facility for an undetermined period of time.", "description": "Vice President Hamilton Mour\u00e3o will be Brazil's acting president through Thursday while President Jair Bolsonaro recovers from abdominal surgery resulting from his stabbing at a political rally last year, his spokesman said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427613375&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870MC", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
