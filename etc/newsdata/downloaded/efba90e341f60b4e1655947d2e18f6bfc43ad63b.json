We've had legal opinion -- from a leading QC (senior lawyer) - that challenges World Rugby's interpretation.\n\n- 'Play 24 hours later' -\n\n\"We don't know that (it's too late) -- we have to challenge it. This is about the game and rugby supporters across the world are absolutely astounded at this rigidity from World Rugby.\"\n\n\"The common-sense approach to this is to play the game 24 hours later in perfect safety where we can make sure that the pool stages are completed,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Scotland coach Gregor Townsend dropped captain Stuart McInally to the bench and installed experienced scrum-half Greig Laidlaw as skipper when he named his team on Friday.\n\nFraser Brown starts at hooker instead of McInally, yet to find his best form in Japan.\n\nBrown, who started at flanker in Wednesday's 61-0 hammering of Russia, is one of three Dark Blues players who will be kicking off for the second time in four days together with wings Tommy Seymour and Darcy Graham.\n\nScotland, who started this World Cup with a woeful 27-3 loss to Ireland, are up against a Japan side who've won all three of their group games so far.\n\n\"The opportunity to face the hosts in such a decisive pool match will be a unique occasion and should be a great spectacle,\" said Townsend.\n\n\"Games of this magnitude don't come around very often in a playing career so we will be giving it everything to make sure it is a memorable match,\" he added.", "description": "Scotland's rugby chief insisted he won't allow his side to become \"collateral damage\" at the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9459/90f1cf8cb48846cb9bb34445c1a27ade.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
