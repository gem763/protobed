The two intertwined drafts have seen heavy lobbying from various interest groups, and remain unsigned on the desk of President Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nA great deal of the debate on the draft laws is centred on the idea of \"fair use\", which could effectively exempt some intellectual property from copyright payments \u2013 including the likes of expensive textbooks.\n\nThat is one of the central complaints of the International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA), an umbrella organisation of American organisations, which lodged the complaint that led to the review.\n\nThe IIPA represents five trade bodies: the Association of American Publishers, the Entertainment Software Association, the Independent Film & Television Alliance, the Recording Industry Association of America, and the American Motion Picture Association.\n\nMembers of each of those organisations, some 3,200 American companies in total, stand to lose money if South Africa loosens its copyright regime. The IIPA also consider South Africa to important in sub-Saharan Africa, with the chance that others may follow its lead.\n\nTo remain part of the GSP \u2013 and benefit from around 3,500 items that can be imported into the US duty free under it \u2013 countries must meet standards around labour rights, provide fair access to their markets in turn, and have effective intellectual property right protections.\n\nThe IIPA has now complained that South Africa is not meeting its obligations in protecting intellectual property, and so must be kicked out of the scheme.\n\nThe US government did not provide detail of the IIPA's complaint, but the organisation has made plain its concerns with SA's moves towards a different copyright regime for years. In a public 2018 report it called for South Africa to be placed on an intellectual property watchlist \u2013 a warning shot of sorts \u2013 and in February this year it called for SA to be promoted to a \"priority watchlist\".\n\nThe way South Africa was going about rewriting copyright law \"will, in particular, imperil the legitimate markets for educational texts, locally distributed works, and online works in general\", the IIPA said.\n\nIt was particularly worried about plans to limit some types of copyright to a maximum 25 year duration \u2013 but more broadly believed South Africa was getting many fundamental things wrong.\n\nThe new laws \"suggest a mistaken assumption that there is a fixed market for works and that the government\u2019s role is to regulate the internal relationships of the creative community, and their authorized distributors, rather than to incentivize new creative output,\" the IIPA said in its review.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The Office of the United States Trade Representative plans hearings on whether South Africa should be kicked out of the US system of Generalized System of Preferences (GPS).", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9524/8c44f919ba074904960309bfd47e325c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
