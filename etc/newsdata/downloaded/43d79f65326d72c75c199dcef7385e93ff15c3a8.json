Mr. Zuckerberg has predicted that such systems will grow increasingly popular as the internet evolves.\n\n\u201cThe future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won\u2019t stick around forever,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in a statement this year announcing the changes. \u201cThis is the future I hope we will help bring about.\u201d\n\nIn their letter, Mr. Barr and the British and Australian officials said law enforcement must be able to unlock encryption systems to retrieve information to \u201csafeguard the public, investigate crimes and prevent future criminal activity.\u201d\n\nThe officials acknowledged that \u201claw-abiding citizens have a legitimate expectation that their privacy will be protected.\u201d But they argued that privacy needs to be balanced with law enforcement agencies\u2019 \u201cability to to stop criminals and abusers in their tracks\u201d that Facebook should be able to provide access if a judge has issued a warrant.\n\nFacebook\u2019s current encryption system, and its plans to expand those protections, impedes law enforcement\u2019s ability to investigate, they wrote. The encryption on WhatsApp blocks Facebook from gaining access to the information its users send on the platform, similar to the system used by the Signal messaging service, considered to be one of the most thorough at protecting users\u2019 privacy.\n\n\u201cThis puts our citizens and societies at risk by severely eroding a company\u2019s ability to detect and respond to illegal content and activity, such as child sexual exploitation and abuse, terrorism, and foreign adversaries\u2019 attempts to undermine democratic values and institutions, preventing the prosecution of offenders and safeguarding of victims,\u201d Mr. Barr and the other officials wrote.", "description": "The Justice Department has long sought access to encrypted messages, alarming privacy  experts.", "authors": ["Julian E.
