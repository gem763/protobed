We conceded goals far too quickly in the first half.\n\n\"We need to do much, much better. I think we had a few players out of position after the sending off and we tried to deal with it as best we could.\n\n\"There are the things we need to look at tomorrow but it was an embarrassing performance.\"\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl added: \"It would be easy to say the red card after 10 minutes was to blame but I think it\u2019s not normal to discuss every goal and every high of the result.\n\n\"I take 100 percent responsibility for this result today and it was no performance from my team this cannot happen in this way.\n\n\"The best thing in the stadium - beside the opposition - were the crowd who stayed in the stadium. How they act is more than we deserve and I apologise for this no performance today.\n\n\"I haven't seen the red card. The first goal started with a pass back, but I don\u2019t know if it was a red.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"We made two changes in the second half and tried to last the half without conceding any more goals.\n\n\"We were not committed enough and with how strong Leicester were we just couldn\u2019t defend against it.\n\n\"If you ask me if I'm shocked tonight, with every goal we conceded, what do you think?\"", "description": "The Foxes ran out 9-0 winners over the Saints at St Mary's on Friday night", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Reuters David Klein", "Getty Images", "Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20727192.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Southampton-v-Leicester-City.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
