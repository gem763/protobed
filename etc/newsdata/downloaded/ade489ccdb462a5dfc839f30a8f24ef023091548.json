RPT-Asia Rice-Firm rupee lifts Indian rates; Vietnam prices hold near 12-year low\n\n(Repeats SEPT 19 story. No change to text.)\n\n* Thai prices unchanged, but still near June 2018 high\n\n* Vietnamese rice rates slump 13% from the beginning of 2019\n\n\n\nBy K. Sathya Narayanan\n\nBENGALURU, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Indian rice export prices\n\nrose this week on a resurgent rupee, while sluggish demand kept\n\nVietnamese rates near a 12-year low even as the country looks to\n\nencourage private investment to make its rice more competitive.\n\nTop exporter India's 5% broken parboiled variety\n\nRI-INBKN5-P1 rose to around $373-$379 per tonne from $370-$376\n\na week ago, despite faltering demand from African countries.\n\nThe rupee INR=D4 on Thursday moved further away from a\n\nnear two-week low touched earlier in the week.\n\nBuying from west African countries, especially from key\n\nbuyer Benin, has been faltering, said Nitin Gupta, vice\n\npresident for Olam India's rice business.\n\nMeanwhile, Vietnam's 5% broken rice RI-VNBKN5-P1 rates\n\nwere unchanged at $325 per tonne, their lowest since November\n\n2007, as \"trading activity remains subdued on weaker demand,\" a\n\nHo Chi Minh City based trader said.\n\nA lack of fresh deals has squeezed the Vietnamese market,\n\nwith prices now about 13% lower than at the beginning of the\n\nyear.\n\nThe country is seeking to encourage private investment in\n\nmodernising local rice processing and storage facilities in\n\norder to raise competitiveness, state media reported on\n\nThursday, citing an official with the Ministry of Agriculture\n\nand Rural Development.\n\nPrices for second-biggest exporter Thailand's benchmark 5%\n\nbroken rice RI-THBKN5-P1 were also unchanged at $400-$418 a\n\ntonne on lack of demand and little fluctuation in the exchange\n\nrate between the baht and U.S. dollar.\n\nAt an average of $409, Thai rice was still near its highest\n\nsince June 2018.\n\nDemand remains flat as higher prices have deterred buyers,\n\ntraders said. A strong baht has kept rates elevated compared\n\nwith competitors since the start of the year.\n\nHowever, concerns over supply persist due to ongoing floods\n\nin northeastern Thailand, along with estimated damage to more\n\nthan 240,000 hectares of agricultural land from floods caused by\n\ntropical storm Podul. \"At the moment there are no immediate concerns over supply\n\nbut we will have to see how much the flood will impact rice\n\nsupply towards the end of the year,\" a Bangkok-based trader\n\nsaid.\n\nBangladesh, also recovering from a devastating flood, is\n\ncontemplating whether to introduce newer rice varieties and\n\ntechnology to try to reduce production costs and boost domestic\n\noutput, Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque said.\n\nDhaka has been unable to clinch overseas deals since a\n\nlong-standing export ban was lifted in May, with its rice more\n\nexpensive than India's or Thailand's, despite a recent fall in\n\nlocal prices.\n\n\n\n", "description": "RPT-Asia Rice-Firm rupee lifts Indian rates; Vietnam prices hold near 12-year low", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA5N005_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
