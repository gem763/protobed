(John Bazemore/AP)\n\nWhat better way to kick off the baseball playoffs than by bringing up the sport\u2019s ongoing identity crisis?\n\nAhead of Tuesday night\u2019s National League wild-card game, Major League Baseball unveiled its annual postseason ad. And for the second year in a row, the spot takes aim at the delicate dynamic between baseball\u2019s past and its future.\n\nTitled \u201cWe play loud,\u201d the 45-second commercial features clips of young stars such as Aaron Judge and Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. slapping fives and flipping bats superimposed into black-and-white footage of the sport\u2019s long-gone era.\n\n[Nationals wild-card roster analysis: So you want to match up]\n\n\u201cThey say baseball isn\u2019t like it used to be. They\u2019re right,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cIt\u2019s faster. Younger. Harder.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the type of \u201cedgy\u201d advertisement that could ruffle some feathers among baseball traditionalists, which seems to be the point.\n\nAnd it wouldn\u2019t be the first time. For those who don\u2019t keep up with the online anger of baseball fans, last year\u2019s postseason commercial caused a minor stir.\n\n\u201cLet the kids play\u201d took an even more direct aim at the game\u2019s old-school tendencies. It ran through a list of the game\u2019s \u201cunwritten rules\u201d before ending with a dramatic shot of Ken Griffey Jr.\n\n\u201cNo more talk,\u201d the Hall of Famer says in the spot. \u201cLet the kids play.\u201d\n\nThe language of youthful rebellion remains in this year\u2019s version.\n\n\u201cThe kids are here,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cAnd We. Play. Loud.\u201d\n\nThe ads represent the dilemma faced by those running the league, especially during the postseason. It is in MLB\u2019s best interest to reach as wide of an audience as possible with its biggest games in an attempt to cultivate the next generation of baseball fans. To do that, marketers want to highlight how the sport has progressed. But MLB simultaneously risks annoying or even alienating its traditionalist fans.\n\nThere is ample evidence of this tug of war. Perhaps the most notable 2019 incident came in April, when MLB\u2019s official Twitter account noted its support of outspoken White Sox infielder Tim Anderson after his bat flip led to a benches-clearing scuffle between the Royals and White Sox.\n\n\u201cKeep doing your thing,\u201d read the tweet, which was directed at Anderson and his \u201cno rules\u201d mantra. The account even made a call back to last year\u2019s ad, using #LetTheKidsPlay.\n\nTwo days later, the league suspended Anderson one game for language he used during the incident. Not their thing, it seems.\n\nRead more about the MLB playoffs:\n\nThe 15 most intriguing characters of the 2019 playoffs\n\nHow Dave Martinez should manage the Nationals\u2019 bullpen tonight, and how he shouldn\u2019t\n\nNationals and Brewers enter NL wild-card game with different plans to get 27 outs\n\nMax Scherzer\u2019s catchers have a story to tell\n\nNew York to new life: How a humbling sweep set the Nationals straight\n\nThe 12 best moments from the Nationals\u2019 wild 2019 season\n\nCharting the wildest season in Nationals history\n\nNationals\u2019 Dave Martinez on recent heart procedure: \u2018I was so, so scared\u2019\n\nBoswell: Sharks are chomping at Nationals Park, and I think we\u2019re going to need a bigger bandwagon\n\nSvrluga: With a playoff history full of nightmares, the Nats enter this year eyes wide open\n\nMax Scherzer\u2019s approach to his last 15 pitches explains everything about him", "description": "The spot, titled \"We play loud,\" is sure to ruffle the feathers of traditionalist fans.", "authors": ["Michael Errigo", "Reporter Covering High School Sports.", "October At Pm", "Michael Errigo Is A High School Sports Reporter", "News Aide For The Washington Post.
