More recently, China said it will buy more agricultural products and President Trump said he\u2019s open to an interim deal.\n\n\n\nThe Dow hasn\u2019t closed in the red since this tide has turned, and its winning run continued on Friday. The index rose 0.14% (or about 37 points) to 27,219.52, marking its 8th straight session in the green.\n\n\n\nThe other indices fell a bit behind. The NASDAQ was off 0.22% (or about 18 points) to 8176.71 and the S&P was down 0.07% to 3007.39.\n\n\n\nHowever, all of them closed higher for a third straight week. The Dow climbed 1.6%, while the S&P and NASDAQ each gained just under 1%.\n\n\n\nHopefully, this improved relationship isn\u2019t ruined in the coming days from any headlines or tweets, especially since the Dow and S&P remain less than 1% away from new highs.\n\n\n\nWhile this week was about trade, next week will be about the Fed. The market expects another rate cut and some dovish words when the Committee meets.\n\n\n\nInvestors are feeling a lot better about the economy since the recession fears from a few weeks back. The trade conflict cooled down and economic data has been mostly positive, such as today\u2019s better-than-expected retail sales result for August.\n\n\n\nAs far as investors are concerned, the Fed needs to keep the good times going. If it does what the market expects, then we\u2019ll probably reach new highs in short order. But if we don't get that cut\u2026 oh boy!\n\n\n\nToday's Portfolio Highlights:\n\n\n\nStocks Under $10: Finding your center is great, but making money while you do it is even better! On Friday, Brian added Gaia (GAIA), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) maker and distributor of videos on yoga and self-help that\u2019s on some big platforms like Roku and Amazon (NASDAQ: ). The company has beaten earnings estimates by double-digits in the past two quarters and appears on its way to profitability. But the editor really likes its sustainable business model and momentum. With the shorts covering and business growing, Brian's getting in on the ground floor of a potentially huge winner. Read the full write-up for more on this new buy.\n\n\n\nValue Investor: Has the bottom been reached for Micron (NASDAQ: )? Tracey isn\u2019t certain, but notices that a few \u201cbrave\u201d analysts have raised estimates and helped the stock rise to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). While the estimate picture remains \u201cawful\u201d, the editor reminds us that its often \u201cdarkest before the dawn\u201d when it comes to cyclical stocks. Demand is expected to improve toward the end of the year and analysts will be late to the party until its conclusive that the bottom is in. We\u2019ll know a lot more when MU reports on Sep. 26. Tracey decided to get involved now, but warns that this could be a volatile name. By the way, she also sold Progressive (NYSE: ) for a 16.3% return after the stock hit one of the portfolio\u2019s stops. Read the complete commentary for more on today\u2019s moves.\n\n\n\nCounterstrike: \"Indices failed to break to all-time highs after a morning session that showed some strength. Markets drifted lower most of the day, but managed to close above the 3000 level ahead of a potential volatile week. The market felt like it was still stuck in a summer Friday today as stocks chopped around on low volume.\n\n\n\n\"The big takeaway from the week is that the China risk has gone away and now traders will look to the Fed. The market has rallied significantly over the last few weeks and all it needs is a dovish Fed to continue higher. I think we will get a 25-basis point cut, but Powell will use language that will reiterate a dovish stance. I think the market will like that outcome and we can see all-time highs.\n\n\n\n\"No cut would bring a big sell off, while a 50-basis point cut would bring a massive lift off. Your guess is as good as mine, but I think Powell wants to remain as neutral as possible, which means the sweet spot is the middle with a quarter point cut.\" -- Jeremy Mullin\n\n\n\nHave a Great Weekend!\n\nJim Giaquinto\n\nRecommendations from Zacks' Private Portfolios:Believe it or not, this article is not available on the Zacks.com website.
