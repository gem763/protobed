At a reunion for his class at the Dutch Academy of Physical Education, the 56-year-old, with an arthritic hip, attempted to demonstrate the pole vault to his former peers. He executed the leap well enough. The landing, less so. Van Gaal blamed the the smooth soles of his footwear for the fall which broke his leg in two places.\n\nHe was admitted to hospital, where doctors inserted six pins into his leg. The next day, he was confined to a wheelchair and swallowing a substantial amount of painkillers but also back at work, watching AZ beat NEC Nijmegen. Over the weeks and months that followed he could be seen barking instructions from a sedentary position on the touchline at the AFAS Stadion, with his leg cast in plaster and stretched out in front of him.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nClearly, Van Gaal had lost none of his eccentricity, but his reputation was perhaps in even worse shape than his leg. He had joined Alkmaar in 2005, a decade on from his career-defining Champions League triumph with Ajax. In the time since, he had been bruised by Barcelona, broken by the Dutch national team and endured a tempestuous spell back in Amsterdam as a technical director.\n\nThe move north to a city known only for its cheese markets appeared to signal a career in decline. But what Van Gaal would achieve in Alkmaar instead sparked a second coming. Without his \u201cgreatest little masterpiece\u201d, as he calls it, he would not have gone on to a Champions League final with Bayern Munich, a World Cup semi-final with the Netherlands and he would not have managed Manchester United.\n\nWhy AZ, then? \u201cThe short answer is: he did not have a whole lot of choice,\u201d says his biographer Maarten Mijers. \u201cVan Gaal is too proud to agree with that assessment, but when he was hired at AZ he had something to prove in order to jump-start his career. Of course, Van Gaal never feels down and out, and he certainly relished the opportunity to remake a poorly-performing-side-with-potential in his own image.\u201d\n\nNo team outside of Holland\u2019s big three \u2013 Ajax, PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord \u2013 had won the league title since AZ in 1981. Despite still being much poorer than those, AZ was backed significantly by owner Dirk Scheringa. \u201cIn Alkmaar he could pretty much do what he wanted, and Louis likes it that way,\u201d adds Mijers. Glance at his AZ squads and you recognise a number of names: Mousa Dembele, Graziano Pelle, Ragnar Klavan and Sergio Romero - likely to start against his old club on Thursday night - are all there.\n\nStijn Schaars joined the project in the summer of 2005 and would become Van Gaal\u2019s captain. \u201cThe way he worked, that in my opinion was another level,\u201d he says of his old boss. \u201cThere\u2019s not one day you can give 95, it\u2019s every day 100 per cent. I can understand that for some players, it is not easy to have him as a coach for years. Sometimes you want to loosen up. With him, it\u2019s not possible. Every day, 100 per cent. For me it worked really well.\u201d\n\nAZ manager Van Gaal in a wheelchair in 2007 (Getty Images)\n\nIt did not immediately bear fruit, though. Just a few months before the pole vaulting incident, in Van Gaal\u2019s second season at the club, a first league title in 26 years was within AZ\u2019s grasp. Top of the table on the final day of the 2006-07 campaign, they only needed to beat relegation-threatened Excelsior to be crowned champions. They had their goalkeeper sent off, lost 3-2 and finished third.\n\nDefeat in the KNVB Cup final followed, as did disappointment in a play-off for Champions League qualification. A season which promised everything up until the final few games resulted in nothing. Results worsened further the following year. Van Gaal survived the leg break during the early part of the 2007-08 season, but his position became increasingly precarious.\n\nOnly a players\u2019 revolt saved him. \u201cI was the main person,\u201d says Schaars. \u201cMe and another guy went upstairs to the director and said: \u2018You can sack him, of course, but the problem is not the trainer. It\u2019s the group.\u2019 The captain and the vice-captain [Kew Jaliens], we were both injured for one year and the way it was in the dressing room, the guys who had the biggest mouth were not the guys who should have it.\u201d\n\nSchaars made clear that Van Gaal was still extremely popular with the players, but also reminded AZ\u2019s decision-makers that this was no ordinary coach. \u201cThey should be happy that a trainer like Van Gaal was a trainer with AZ,\u201d he says. \u201cThis kind of thing would not happen every year for AZ. Think about before you do this.\u201d AZ heeded Schaars\u2019s warning. \u201cIn the end, it worked out.\u201d\n\nAt Alkmaar\u2019s local cheese market the following summer, a fortune-teller told Van Gaal that his side would be crowned champions on 19 April. That appeared unlikely when they opened the Eredivisie season with two defeats but a 28-game unbeaten run followed, lasting the best part of eight months. It ended on 18 April, but Ajax\u2019s 6-2 defeat to PSV the following day made AZ\u2019s lead at the top unassailable. The long wait for a new team to win the Dutch top flight was over.;\n\nDespite an unsuccessful tenure, Van Gaal\u2019s influence is still present at United (Getty)\n\nSchaars uses the word \u2018machine\u2019 repeatedly when describing that title-winning AZ team. \u201cEvery game we went on the pitch, we knew we were going to win. We were the best at playing football, the best organised, the best dedication.\u201d The secret, put simply, was Van Gaal. \u201cHis influence was big. Every day, every hour, every minute, he\u2019s on the spot. He\u2019s never out of balance, always in control. That\u2019s why he\u2019s special, different to other trainers.\u201d\n\nOnly one side outside Holland\u2019s big three \u2013 Steve McClaren\u2019s FC Twente \u2013 has matched AZ\u2019s 2009 achievement since. The likelihood of another any time soon is remote. \u201cIt continues to be an amazing accomplishment, something quite similar in stature to Claudio Ranieri winning the Premier League with Leicester City in 2016,\u201d says Meijer. \u201cThe minnows beat the big boys in style and how \u2013 most of \u2013 the people loved it. Hollywood makes billions selling underdog-beats-big-dude stories.\u201d;\n\nVan Gaal, meanwhile, needed to cash in. He was one of the more unlikely victims of Bernie Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme. He traded the power and influence he held at AZ for the greater financial security of Bayern, a job which reestablished his reputation as one of European football\u2019s leading coaches and that, in turn, paved the way to Old Trafford. Van Gaal was unsuccessful at United, but his influence is still there, and it would not be if not for a brilliant yet under-appreciated spell in Alkmaar.\n\nRead more\n\nSolskjaer: Alkmaar plastic pitch is one of \u2018worst ever\u2019\n\nPogba to miss Europa League clash with foot injury\n\nSchmeichel: Pogba is Manchester United\u2019s \u2018problem child\u2019", "description": "In the autumn of 2007, there came a moment that neatly summed up Louis van Gaal\u2019s time at AZ Alkmaar up to that point.
