The Pumas, whose qualification hopes were ended by defeats at the hands of France and England, picked a young team and the newcomers took their chance to play with confidence and ambition that left the Americans clutching at shadows.\n\nThere were two tries each for Joaqu\u00edn Tuculet and man-of-the-match centre Juan Cruz Mallia, while recalled flyhalf Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez, Jer\u00f3nimo de la Fuente and Gonzalo Bertranou also scored to secure their ninth win in nine meetings with the US. They finish third in the pool with 11 points from their wins over Tonga and the US but that represented a considerable step backwards for the 2015 semi-finalists, especially on the back of such an impressive Super Rugby campaign by the Jaguares.\n\nRugby World Cup group-stage deciders threatened by Super Typhoon Hagibis Read more\n\nThe US, who have now managed only three wins in their 26 World Cup games, will hope to end with a fourth from their final game against Tonga but will have to dramatically improve their defence after missing almost 50 tackles on Wednesday.\n\nArgentina were on top from the start and Mallia set up the first try when he cut through a ragged American defensive line to feed S\u00e1nchez on his shoulder after 19 minutes. S\u00e1nchez then set up the second as his short kick took a horrible bounce to wrong-foot Mike Te\u2019o and give Tuculet an unexpected second, followed soon after by his own second and the team\u2019s third.\n\nThe Americans got on the scoreboard at the end of the half when flyhalf AJ MacGinty sent a grubber kick into the corner for captain Blaine Scully to scamper on to and touch down.\n\nBautista Delguy had the crowd on their feet at the start of the second half with an outrageous run from behind his own line and through half a dozen defenders all the way to the halfway line. He was unable to complete but the next score was only minutes away as Mallia, again untouched, got the fourth, and soon after, and identical fifth after a quick lineout caught the Americans napping.\n\nIt was then De La Fuente\u2019s turn to run in unharried. The Americans kept going and were rewarded when Paul Lasike showed great strength to smash his way over for their second try. Bertranou then became the latest to benefit from more great work by Mallia but the US had the final word with Scully\u2019s second.", "description": "Argentina\u2019s backline cut loose for the first time at the Rugby World Cup as the Pumas closed a disappointing campaign with a 47-17 bonus point victory", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27ca24c949959157eb434e2df9d286ce52cbdca2/0_247_3708_2226/master/3708.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=604d159454cd7e436f80607b05465f18", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
