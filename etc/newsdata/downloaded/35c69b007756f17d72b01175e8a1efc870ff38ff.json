This year, the Mikisew Cree First Nation member received the 2018 Indspire Award for business and commerce.\n\n\u201cIt really is validating,\u201d said Bourque-Bouchier. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m paving a path for Indigenous women.\u201d\n\nFinding strength in tragedy\n\nBorn in the Northwest Territories, Bourque-Bouchier was raised in Fort McMurray, Alta., the eldest of four girls.\n\nGrowing up surrounded by the small community of First Nations and M\u00e9tis people of Fort Chipewyan kept her rooted in her Indigenous identity. Among her many mentors was her father, who passed down the rich culture of the Mikisew Cree First Nation to her and her three younger sisters.\n\nAfter the unexpected deaths of her siblings, she found the resilience to push forward, motivated to create a better future for her community.\n\n\u201cI was the last surviving, and instead of wallowing, I decided to keep going and do something better for myself,\u201d said Bourque-Bouchier.\n\nShe decided that entrepreneurship held the key. Her time in Fort McMurray \u2014 the heart of Canada\u2019s oilsands \u2014 inspired her to pave a foundation for women in the construction industry.\n\nAlong with her husband, she founded The Bouchier Group. The company has a construction arm, which does everything from building roads to steel fabrication, and a site services arm, which specializes in camp maintenance and logistics. As the Athabasca oilsands grew, The Bouchier Group did, too, ultimately growing from 35 to 1,000 employees.\n\n\"I was the only female in the room and I\u2019d be addressed as my husband\u2019s assistant.\"\n\nBourque-Bouchier pointed out that this success didn\u2019t happen overnight. It took her 14 years of patience and dedication to earn the respect of her industry, learning hands-on, working from the ground up. A novice in the field, she was also navigating the obstacles as an Indigenous woman in a predominantly white, male-dominated construction industry.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, I was the silent person in the room,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t look at me. I was the only female in the room and I\u2019d be addressed as my husband\u2019s assistant.\u201d\n\nBourque-Bouchier has made serious strides in breaking down gender barriers in the oilsands. But more importantly, she\u2019s been instrumental in making The Bouchier Group a massive success. Under her leadership, the company has become one of Fort McMurray\u2019s largest local contractors, while also maintaining a strong sense of social responsibility.\n\nShe is also helping build the next generation of Indigenous women entrepreneurs. Bourque-Bouchier has helped raise more that $3 million to fund local initiatives to empower Indigenous women in the workforce.\n\n\u201cI think that we have a sense of community and a priority to give back to these communities no matter how small or big we are,\u201d said Bourque-Bouchier.\n\nAbigail Murta is a Toronto-based journalist who writes human interest stories focusing on social change, arts and culture.
