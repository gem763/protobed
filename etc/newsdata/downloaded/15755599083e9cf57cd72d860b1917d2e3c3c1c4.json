Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang declared that it amounted to a form of foreign interference.\n\n\u201cHong Kong affairs are China\u2019s internal affairs that allow no interference from foreign governments, organizations or individuals,\u201d Geng told a press conference on Friday. \u201cWe urge the relevant person to exercise caution in her words and deeds based on a fair and just attitude, and to stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d\n\nThe state propaganda outlet Global Times published a typically brazen editorial attacking the nomination, arguing that the \u201csmall group of rioters\u201d do not reflect the \u201cpeople of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the \u2018people of Hong Kong\u2019 refers to whom: The majority of Hongkongers who oppose violence or a small group of rioters? Melby and many others in the West never make this clear,\u201d the editorial read.\n\n\u201cConfusing these two groups is, in fact, advocating violence. And encouraging a \u201cnonviolent\u201d way is actually an attempt to cover up their motives,\u201d it continued. \u201cWith their encouragement and instigation, the rioters in Hong Kong will only become increasingly rampant.\u201d\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by massive protests since June after the city\u2019s China-controlled legislature proposed a bill that would have given China the power to extradite its citizens to China.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has since pledged to scrap the bill. Protesters listed the bill as one of five core demands to their government and have not stopped taking the streets.\n\nIn a scathing editorial, Global Times writer Sia Tian went on to argue how it was completely \u201cabsurd\u201d to nominate the protesters for a peace award, given the alleged havoc they have wreaked on the city. The writer fails to mention the overwhelming amount of violence perpetrated at protests has been by either police forces or pro-China criminal mobs:\n\nFour months ago, Hong Kong was a stable city with a booming market economy and a good connection with the Chinese mainland. Citizens could walk along the streets with ease. However, what is the city like now? Didn\u2019t the violent protesters throw the city into chaos and place ordinary citizens on tenterhooks? A group, which has turned a stable and peaceful region upside down, was nominated to a peace prize and gained widely support from the Western community. It is completely absurd. If this is how a \u201cpeace\u201d prize works, many anti-government forces and violent demonstrators in the Western world should also be regarded as honored guests at the award ceremony. But why do they receive warrants of arrest instead of invitation letters in the West?\n\nIt is not the first time that Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Last year, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers nominated activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Alex Chow for the award, arguing that they had \u201cdemonstrated civic courage, extraordinary leadership, and an unwavering commitment to a free and prosperous Hong Kong that upholds the rule of law, political freedoms, and human rights.\u201d\n\nThey lost out to Congolese gynecologist Dr. Denis Mukwege and former Yazidi Islamic State captive Nadia Murad for their contributions toward combating wartime sexual violence.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "China called the nomination of the Hong Kong protest movement to the Nobel Peace Prize by a Norwegian lawmaker\u00a0\"foreign interference.\"", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/hong-kong-protests-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
