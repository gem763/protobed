USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Victor Robles delivered big for the Nationals in his return to the lineup after missing the last five games with an injury \u2013 but it was even bigger considering who was in attendance for the first time in his big-league career.\n\nRobles' mother, Marcia Brito, was at Game 3 of the National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals on Monday night. She had never seen her son play in person in the majors.\n\nAfter being shelved for 10 days with a hamstring injury, her son didn't disappoint. The Nationals' 22-year old center fielder sparked a four-run rally in the second inning against Cardinals ace Jack Flaherty and homered in the sixth inning to help lead Washington to an 8-1 victory in front of a rowdy crowd at Nationals Park.\n\n\"It was very special and obviously a lot of love,\" Robles said after the game through team translator. \"I felt excited. I felt my mom\u2019s strength there. I was fortunate enough to hit a home run in her presence. I wanted to make sure I recognized that and showed her some love.\"\n\nNationals center fielder Victor Robles homered and singled in his return to the lineup.

As Robles crossed home plate after his solo homer, he turned to the stands where his mother and friends were sitting and tipped his cap to them.\n\nThere was debate whether Robles would be ready to return to the lineup so soon, especially considering the success Michael A. Taylor \u2013 who hit a homer in Game 2 - was having in his place. But Nationals manager Dave Martinez had been saying all along he wanted to get Robles back in the lineup as quickly as he could.\n\n\u201cHe ran the bases and ran them full tilt,\u201d Martinez said before the game. \u201cHe looked really good. We wanted him to hit on the field. He couldn\u2019t do that, obviously, because it started pouring down rain. But he hit in the cage, took some good swings. He\u2019s raring to go. Excited to be back on the field.\n\nMartinez has been committed to Robles returning to the lineup once 100% healthy, and said he prefers Taylor coming off the bench.\n\n\u201cMichael\u2019s played really, really well,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cBut with Victor, it\u2019s getting him loose and in the game and letting him play, as opposed to keeping him on the bench, trying to get him loose again. I talked to the training staff about that and felt that he should just get loose and get in the game. If something happens, Michael is ready to play.\u201d\n\nMartinez wrote Robles in at the eighth spot in the lineup and he made him look like a genius.\n\nRobles said he worked hard to back into the lineup and knew that day would come sooner than later.\n\n\u201cA lot of times when you have an injury like the one I have, it's a couple months to come back from,\" he said. \"I was able to come back from it in a little more than a week and a half. I had a lot of faith in God and I knew that he was going to heal me as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter the victory, Robles met his mother in the tunnel and received a hug. Asked if she would be in attendance for Game 4 on Tuesday with the Nationals on the brink of a World Series:\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\" he said, \"she\u2019ll be here tomorrow.\u201d", "description": "After missing the last five games with a hamstring injury, young Victor Robles came through for the Nationals in their Game 3 win on Monday.", "authors": ["Scott Boeck", "Published A.M.
