Lesbians and single women who want to have children often travel abroad to fertility clinics for treatment, a situation they say is discriminatory.\n\nThe draft law, which represents Emmanuel Macron\u2019s biggest social reform since he became president in 2017, has drawn the ire of conservatives as well as some in his own party who claim it would make children \u201cfatherless\u201d.\n\nMacron, who acknowledged last week the political risk of the legislation, is mindful of the backlash six years ago against same-sex marriage, legalised under his Socialist predecessor Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\n\nThe bioethics bill must now be approved by the upper house, the senate, before it can become law.", "description": "Controversial bill is Emmanuel Macron\u2019s biggest social reform since he was elected in 2017", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Paris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5505c127b9d5d1b8c8bdd0b13ca3d05010de452f/0_117_2817_1690/master/2817.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8f8e1c6901efdd43f7eec959d0810cf5", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
