A nationwide panel of 66 media members chose the classic over the 1981 NFC title match featuring the Joe Montana pass to Dwight Clark known as \u201cThe Catch,\u201d and the \u201cIce Bowl\u201d in Green Bay for the 1967 league title.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s win on Alan \u201cThe Horse\u201d Ameche\u2019s 1-yard touchdown run served as a catalyst for NFL popularity. The sport generally ranked behind baseball, boxing and college football back then, with even horse racing getting as much attention. But America was entranced by the drama and the stars such as John Unitas, Frank Gifford, Sam Huff, and Gino Marchetti - who broke his leg early in the game. In all, 17 future Hall of Famers participated.\n\n\u201cIt was New York that did it,\u201d said Colts running back Lenny Moore, one of those Hall of Famers. \u201cIf it had been Baltimore against \u2026 maybe Cleveland \u2026 most people wouldn\u2019t have noticed, certainly not Madison Avenue or the media.\u201d\n\nBut Americans did notice, a true turning point for the NFL.\n\n\u201cPete Rozelle always told me that the reason pro football took off was because that happened just at that time, in that season, and it happened in New York,\u201d Giants owner Wellington Mara once said.\n\nThere was even some confusion among fans and, yes, players at Yankee Stadium, plus those watching on TV, what would happen after Steve Myhra\u2019s 20-yard field goal tied it. No postseason game had ever been tied after regulation.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Colts standout receiver Raymond Berry said. \u201cWe\u2019d never played it. Nobody had ever played it. Nobody really knew what came next.\u201d\n\nNew York won the coin toss for overtime, couldn\u2019t move the ball, and Unitas guided the Colts 80 yards on 13 plays to Ameche\u2019s conclusion to the NFL\u2019s greatest game.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t judge for anyone else,\u201d said Ameche, whose nickname emanated from his willing to practice, \u201cbut it\u2019s the greatest game I ever played in.\u201d\n\nThe greatness of the event was not particularly marred by the sloppiness on the field. There were six lost fumbles, and Colts coach Weeb Ewbank - the only man to lead NFL and AFL championship teams - shackled Unitas for most of the OT drive.\n\nBut the status of a game some media called \u201can epic\u201d never has diminished, and in the midst of the league hitting the century mark, it has been deemed No. 1 amongst all.\n\nIt received 18 first-place votes , by far the most in the balloting. Next best for top votes was the Patriots\u2019 rally from 28-3 to beat the Falcons in the 2017 Super Bowl, which got 10 and finished ninth overall. The Ice Bowl got eight first-place selections.\n\nSixty-one years later, though, Colts-Giants reigns.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to point to one game that gave the NFL momentum to accomplish some of the things that the league has been able to do,\u201d said Pete Rozelle, then the GM of the Rams and generally considered the best commissioner in pro sports history, \u201cit would have to be the 1958 championship game.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\" is, well, exactly that.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barry Wilner"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
