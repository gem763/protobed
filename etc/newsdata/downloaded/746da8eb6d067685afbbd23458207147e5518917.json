During the interview, Farrow said NBCUniversal deserved praise for the NDA decision, and that many women he spoke to while writing the book \u201cfelt constrained\u201d and \u201cagonized\u201d by their confidentially agreements.\n\n\u201cI think this will go a long way towards making them feel that they can discuss this openly,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso Read: Harvey Weinstein Rebuked at Invite-Only Actors Event - and Actor Who Confronted Him Got Ejected (Video)\n\nFarrow originally worked on what would become his bombshell Harvey Weinstein expose for NBC News, but the network killed the story in August 2017. Farrow subsequently took it to The New Yorker, which published the report just two months later. NBC said it killed the story because the reporting was incomplete, and that Farrow had no accusers willing to go on the record. However, multiple women went on the record for the New Yorker article; Farrow eventually won a Pulitzer prize.\n\nFarrow and his producer at the time, Rich McHugh, said NBC News executives instructed him to stop reporting on Weinstein\u2019s behavior because of pressure on the network from the disgraced mogul. In his book, Farrow also insinuates that NBC may have killed the story because Weinstein attempted to leverage accusations of sexual misconduct against former \u201cToday\u201d show host Matt Lauer. Both NBC News and Weinstein have denied this claim.\n\nSince the book\u2019s release, there have since been widespread calls for NBC to release employees from their nondisclosure agreements, including from former NBC personality Megyn Kelly, who also called on the network to submit to an outside investigation into how it handled accusations against Lauer. So far, the network says it will not do so.\n\nNBC Universal did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment from TheWrap.\n\nRead original story NBCU Says It Will Void Nondisclosure Agreements for Ex-Employees Who Want to Discuss Sexual Misconduct At TheWrap", "description": "Following criticism inspired by Ronan Farrow\u2019s \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d NBCUniversal said Friday it will release former employees from nondisclosure agreements so that they may publicly discuss sexual harassment or misconduct accusations.In a statement first made public by Rachel Maddow during her MSNBC show", "authors": ["Ross A.
