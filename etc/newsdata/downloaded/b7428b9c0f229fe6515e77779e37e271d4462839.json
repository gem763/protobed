I\u2019ve avoided trips if I didn\u2019t need to do them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe had got rid of some of his collection of luxury cars, which he said he rarely drove anyway, and switched to hybrid or electric models. He said he was also working with the team and Mercedes on a more environmentally-friendly approach.\n\n\u201cI want everything recyclable, down to deodorant, toothbrush, all these kind of things. I\u2019m trying to make as much change as I can in my personal space,\u201d he told reporters ahead of Sunday\u2019s race.\n\n\u201cI feel positive that I am making those changes. I\u2019m encouraging people around me also, my friends are seeing me doing that and also being more conscious.\u201d\n\nHamilton, who is vegan, attracted both criticism and support after a series of posts on social media last week in which he deplored the state of the planet and said he felt like giving up.\n\nHe told reporters on Thursday his comments had been triggered by watching a documentary and he had wanted to raise awareness.\n\nHamilton said he still loved racing, but had \u201cno interest whatsoever\u201d in switching to the all-electric Formula E series, and accepted criticism for calling for change while continuing to race in F1.\n\nHIGHER FOOTPRINT\n\n\u201cIt is not the easiest because yes we are travelling around the world and we are racing Formula One cars. Our carbon footprint for sure is higher than the average homeowner that lives in the same city,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean you should be afraid to speak out about things that can be for a positive change.\n\n\u201cI am looking at things and how I can improve the effect I am having on the world. It takes a while. It\u2019s not a quick fix. It\u2019s just about education and I am trying to highlight areas.\n\n\u201cI feel like I wouldn\u2019t be doing anything positive if I didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d\n\nHamilton\u2019s stance was supported by other Formula One drivers.\n\n\u201cJust because we\u2019re in Formula One, it doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t care about the environment,\u201d said Red Bull\u2019s British-born Thai racer Alexander Albon.\n\nFerrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel, a four times world champion who stays well clear of social media and keeps his personal life off the radar, said the sport must do more.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cYou would be ignorant if you wouldn\u2019t look at it. As Lewis mentioned, it\u2019s very difficult for us to get acceptance from outside because we don\u2019t have the smallest footprint as the races happen around the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn general, Formula One I feel should do more... we should send a much stronger message. Everybody can do something, contribute a little bit.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s inevitable that change is coming and hopefully rather sooner than later.\u201d", "description": "Lewis Hamilton detailed on Thursday how he was trying to reduce his carbon footprint and defended his right to speak out on environmental issues while also racing around the world with Formula One.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444673187&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N25S", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
