It's a true glimpse into the injustice that still happens today.'\n\n'wow i cried!!!': Kim Kardashian shared on Friday how moved she was by the upcoming drama Just Mercy about wrongful conviction\n\nMichael B. Jordan stars as Bryan Stevenson, the attorney who defended Walter McMillian, who is played by Jamie Foxx.\n\nMcMillan, a black Alabama pulpwood worker, spent six years on death row for murder before a court decided he was wrongfully convicted and released him.\n\nKardashian used the example of Just Mercy to segue into a defense of Rodney Reed, who is scheduled to be executed in Texas on November 20.\n\n'After watching the movie I opened up my computer & opened up my email about a case I had recently been investigating, @FreeRodneyReed. I have been hearing about him and his story for the last week. On Nov. 20, Texas will execute Rodney Reed. I believe he is innocent,' she wrote.\n\n'Injustice that still happens today': 'I just saw the movie Just Mercy, the film about Bryan Stevenson's book starring Jamie Foxx & Michael B Jordan,' wrote the 38-year-old\n\nTagging the Governor of Texas, she added: 'PLEASE @GovAbbott How can you execute a man when since his trial, substantial evidence that would exonerate Rodney Reed has come forward and even implicates the other person of interest. I URGE YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING.'\n\nReed, who is black, was convicted of kidnapping, raping and strangling 19-year-old Stacey Stites, who was white, in Texas in 1996.\n\nHe has continuously insisted he is innocent, as has Stites' family, who suspect her former police officer fiance Jimmy Lewis Fennell Jr. of the crime.\n\nWrongfully convicted: Michael B.
