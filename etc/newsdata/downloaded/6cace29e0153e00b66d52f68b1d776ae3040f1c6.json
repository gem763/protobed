REUTERS/Joe White\n\nVolkswagen is readying two Chinese factories to build electric cars next year. The Chinese plants will have a production capacity of 600,000 vehicles, according to Volkswagen\u2019s plans, which have not been previously reported - revealing VW\u2019s ability to industrialise production faster than other pioneers in the electric vehicle market.\n\nTesla is still trying to reach its goal of making more than 500,000 cars a year by building a new factory in Shanghai, China, while VW can rely on an established workforce in two of its plants in Anting and Foshun to build zero-emission cars.\n\nThe scale and speed of VW\u2019s electrification push marks a shift in favour of established manufacturers that can use existing factories and profit from combustion-engined sport utility vehicles (SUVs) to scale up faster than startups.\n\n\u201cThe truth is barriers to entry in autos remain high,\u201d said Max Warburton, an analyst at Bernstein Research. \u201cMaking cars is hard. The move to electric vehicles will be expensive, but will probably be led by traditional manufacturers.\u201d\n\nVW is leveraging its large infrastructure of suppliers, factories and workers, long a handicap to its profitability, more aggressively than rivals BMW, Renault SA, General Motors Co and Tesla, which were all quicker to sell a custom-designed electric car.\n\nRather than adjusting production gradually, and using multi-powertrain platforms, Volkswagen is making a massive bet on a dedicated electric vehicle architecture, known as MEB, in the hope of increasing economies of scale sufficiently to push down the price of electric cars to around 20,000 euros ($22,262).\n\nThe Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker is retooling eight plants across the globe by 2022 to specialise in manufacturing electric cars, and license its electric MEB platform to rivals, senior VW executives told Reuters, putting it on track to become the world\u2019s largest maker of zero-emission vehicles.\n\nTesla has emerged as a serious competitor with a credible car, its Model 3, Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess told Reuters last week. But startups have a hard time entering mass production without sufficient production facilities, he said.\n\n\u201cThe question is, can you expand your production quickly enough? The capital intensity is increasing,\u201d Diess said.\n\nTo fund its own electrification shift, the German carmaker aims to increase sales of VW SUVs, with combustion engines, to 40% of overall sales by 2020 from 23% in 2018.\n\nThe powerstation that supplies energy for VW\u2019s flagship e-vehicle factory in Zwickau, Germany, marked by two tall chimneys, was built to power production of the combustion-engined Volkswagen Golf.\n\nNow Zwickau can piggyback off this infrastructure to ramp up production to 330,000 VW ID electric cars by 2021.\n\nVolkswagen Group will increase economies of scale by rolling out electric vehicle platforms to its Audi, Skoda and Seat and Porsche brands.\n\nVolkswagen Group will be in a position to build 22 million electric cars by 2028, of which 11.6 million could come out of Chinese factories, VW said.\n\nFor a graphic version of story \"Global automakers invest in electric vehicles\", click: tmsnrt.rs/2Hcr3H4\n\nPRODUCTION PAIN\n\nVW\u2019s expansion push comes at a time when investors have started to question businesses delivering growth without real profit, a change in sentiment that is crippling the ability of several electric car pioneers to raise more cash.\n\nBack in 2016, Tesla said it wanted to build more than 500,000 Model 3 cars by 2018, a goal it has failed to meet. This year it expects to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars, a target that includes selling all models.\n\nTesla\u2019s struggles have dampened optimism about how easy it is to enter the car business, making it harder for China\u2019s NIO, backed by internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd, as well as others like Faraday Future and Byton Ltd, to fund the next stage of growth: capital-intensive volume production and sales.\n\n\u201cSo much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you.\u201d\n\nAfter starting trial production runs at its factory in Shanghai, Tesla now hopes to reach its 500,000-vehicle target in the 12-month period ending June 30, 2020. Tesla is also looking for a site to start production in Europe.\n\nVolkswagen is converting two German plants, Hanover and Zwickau, to build electric vehicles and will retool other factories including plants in China: Foshan which VW runs together with its joint-venture partner FAW-Volkswagen, and another in Anting, which VW runs together with SAIC.\n\nIt will retool plants in Emden and Dresden in Germany, Mlada Boleslav in the Czech Republic, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, in United States, as part of a 30 billion-euro ($33.24 billion)investment push into e-mobility by 2023.\n\nAs a result, Volkswagen Group will be the No. 1 electric vehicle producer globally by 2025, while Tesla is likely to remain a niche player, according to UBS autos analyst Patrick Hummel.\n\nTECHNOLOGY INTERLOPERS\n\nThe cutthroat rivalry between automakers and software companies started when Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google presented a prototype autonomous vehicle in 2012, leading analysts and industry executives to fear a so-called Nokia moment. This occurs when a new player from the tech sector unveils a superior design, in the way that Apple Inc presented the iPhone in 2007, ending Nokia\u2019s dominance of the mobile handset business.\n\nToday, Tesla\u2019s cars are generally perceived as cutting-edge and potentially more sophisticated than VW\u2019s. Volkswagen\u2019s ID.3, which starts production this year, has an operating range of between 330 and 550 kilometers (205 to 341 miles), below the 560 km long-range Model 3 version offered by Tesla.\n\nThat is because Tesla has a sophisticated software algorithm to control how much electricity goes to the electric motor, air conditioning, seat heaters, in-car infotainment, and cooling system.\n\nVolkswagen\u2019s edge is more blunt: price and massive economies of scale.\n\nThe ID.3 has a starting price of under 30,000 euros ($33,363) in Germany. By contrast, Tesla\u2019s Model 3 had an average selling price of $50,000 in the second quarter. The long-range version retails for 52,390 euros in Germany.\n\nThe VW vehicle\u2019s lower price comes from the carmaker\u2019s ability to place large orders which, by nature of their size, help drive down the price. Volkswagen is investing 50 billion euros ($55.5 billion) to buy battery cells and will also license its MEB electric car platform to rival carmakers to further increase economies of scale.\n\nThat is, Volkswagen will make that huge investment if suppliers can keep up.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of investment,\u201d Stefan Sommer, Volkswagen Group\u2019s board member responsible for procurement, told Reuters last month. \u201cBut even the big companies like Samsung, CATL, LG Chem, the big guys, SK, they hesitate to take so much money and invest because they are not seeing the market on the other side.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are now seeing the first battery plants, LG in Poland, CATL in Germany, they don\u2019t have the skilled workforce. That will be the bottleneck,\u201d Sommer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a learning curve everybody has to work through. This will cause some lags in supply. We have no other choice.\u201d\n\nVW plans to license its electric MEB vehicle platform to rival Ford Motor Co, which will give VW $10 billion in revenue over the next six years.\n\nThomas Ulbrich, Volkswagen\u2019s member of the board who oversees production of electric vehicles, told Reuters, \u201cFord and Volkswagen\u2019s agreement will be a blueprint for further licensing deals.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nIn the short term, Volkswagen and its Chinese joint venture partners will invest 15 billion euros to produce 15 different electric cars for China alone by 2025.\n\n\u201cThe first MEB-based vehicle is an SUV model,\u201d Volkswagen said about its China push.\n\nFor a graphic version of story \"Global automakers invest in electric vehicles\", click: tmsnrt.rs/2Hcr3H4", "description": "Volkswagen AG is ramping up production of electric cars to around 1 million vehicles by end of 2022, according to manufacturing plans seen by Reuters, enabling the German carmaker to leapfrog Tesla Inc and making China the key battleground.", "authors": ["Edward Taylor", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445989620&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1BG", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
