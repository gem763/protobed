(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nBrionna Jones and Shatori Walker-Kimbrough don\u2019t get to be on the basketball court together much anymore, even when their WNBA teams play each other. So at the end of the Washington Mystics\u2019 43-point regular season win over Jones\u2019s Connecticut Sun in June, Walker-Kimbrough sprinted over to her former Maryland teammate and wrapped her in a bear hug as Jones tried to wriggle away, half laughing and half grimacing.\n\nThe pair led Coach Brenda Frese\u2019s Maryland Terrapins to consecutive Final Four appearances in 2014 and 2015. On Sunday, when Game 1 of the WNBA Finals tips off between the top-seeded Mystics and second-seeded Sun, they again will be competing for a championship. They just will be going against each other this time.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no taking it easy; there\u2019s too much at stake,\u201d Walker-Kimbrough said of playing Jones. \u201cBut there\u2019s always that family tie, that mutual respect as players, as women, respect for what we did back at Maryland, being able to leave the program better than where we found it. That\u2019s my sister for life. \u201d\n\nJones and Walker-Kimbrough, whose jerseys hang in the rafters at Xfinity Center on their college campus, won\u2019t be the only Terps on the court Sunday. The series features five Maryland graduates: Walker-Kimbrough (Class of \u201917), Tianna Hawkins (\u201813) and Kristi Toliver (\u201909) on the Mystics, and Jones (\u201817) and Alyssa Thomas (\u201914) on the Sun.\n\n[\u2018Chill. We\u2019re not doing Champagne right now\u2019: Mystics aren\u2019t satisfied with reaching WNBA Finals]\n\nWashington\u2019s top pick in this spring\u2019s draft, Kiara Leslie, played two seasons at Maryland before playing her final two seasons at North Carolina State, but she has missed the entire season with a knee injury.\n\nAll of those Maryland ties add an extra level of pride to the already high-stakes Finals.\n\nAll of the players reached at least an Elite Eight in the NCAA tournament during their time in College Park, but only Toliver captured the NCAA title that helped define Frese\u2019s program. She hit the last-second three-pointer that forced overtime in the 2006 national championship game against Duke as a freshman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a coach\u2019s dream to be able to have so many of them playing for the championship, for what it\u2019s all worth,\u201d said Frese, who plans to be at Game 1 at Entertainment and Sports Arena. \u201cI think each of them holds a really special place in our hearts, and all of them had a huge piece to the success of our program, so that\u2019s what makes it so exciting. They just continue to validate what kind of winners they are. \u201d\n\nFor Walker-Kimbrough, having two fellow Terps on the active roster provides opportunity for a little levity during the season \u2014 should she, Toliver and Hawkins end up on the same team during a drill in practice, she will start trash talking the other side, flaunting the \u201cTerp Squad\u201d or team \u201cFear the Turtle.\u201d\n\nFor Jones, who overlapped for one year with Thomas, the older Terrapin was the only person she knew on the Connecticut Sun her first year in the league.\n\n\u201cShe was just someone I could always go to, I could ask her questions as a rookie,\u201d said Jones, whose younger sister, Stephanie, is a senior on Frese\u2019s team this year.\n\nWashington Coach-General Manager Mike Thibault swears he doesn\u2019t purposefully draft Maryland grads. It\u2019s just that Frese has staked her reputation on recruiting some of the best players in the nation.\n\n\u201cPeople used to think when I was coaching Connecticut I took U-Conn. players purposefully,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cIt helps if you have a U-Conn. player, but, you know, there\u2019s a reason those teams are top-10 teams all the time in college basketball. As a general rule, you\u2019re going to take the best players from the best teams in the country. That\u2019s just the way it turns out.\u201d\n\nFrese recruits top-level talent, no doubt, but her former players say how she prepares her teams for the future matters as well. Hawkins, Walker-Kimbrough and Jones all spoke of learning to be responsible, accountable adults off the court under Frese\u2019s tutelage \u2014 \u201cYou know, cook for yourself, take care of bills,\u201d Jones said \u2014 while Toliver praised Maryland\u2019s coaching staff for pushing players to improve every year.\n\n\u201cWhenever you have a lot of alumni in the best league in the world, that says something about your foundation,\u201d Toliver said. \u201c \u2026 It started with that four-year foundation of getting back to the fundamentals, building resilience, playing in championship games and atmospheres.\u201d\n\nWalker-Kimbrough remembers Frese pushing her hard in her Maryland days and helping elevate her game from an under-recruited wing to sitting fourth on the program\u2019s all-time career scoring list with 2,156 points. Thomas is first (2,356), Toliver is fifth (2,078) and Jones is sixth (1,928).\n\nWhen asked how Frese prepared her for the pros, Walker-Kimbrough clapped her hands to punctuate the first two words of her response.\n\n\u201cEveryday. Everyday. I was like, \u2018Why is she always yelling at me? Am I the only on the court?\u2019 \u201d Walker-Kimbrough said, looking around in fake surprise. \u201cBut now, looking back, I\u2019m so thankful that she did \u2014 maybe don\u2019t tell her that. I\u2019m just happy with how she pushed me. She was hard on me. She challenged me as a player. She challenged me as a leader.\u201d\n\nHawkins describes Maryland as having an open-door policy for alums; she\u2019s been known to drop in on a winter practice to work on her conditioning with the college team. Frese still sends a text to her players whenever they have a birthday, make the all-star team or celebrate another big milestone in life.\n\nThe former Maryland players who aren\u2019t on the same roster keep in touch mainly through texts nowadays, though most of their talking happens when they meet in games, like they will Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good day to be a Terp,\u201d Toliver said.\n\nRead more:\n\nSun is relishing underdog role vs. Mystics in finals\n\nThe inaugural Mystics hardly ever won.
