The daughter of professional wrestlers Ian Bevis and Julia Hamer-Bevis, the athlete developed a keen interest in the sport as a teenager and began attending wrestling training boot camps run by her father.\n\nDespite her amateur wrestling beginning, Paige went onto sign a contract with the WWE in 2011.\n\nThe wrestler and her family were also the subject of a UK Channel 4 documentary The Wrestlers: Fighting With My Family when Paige was just 13. The programme chronicled the teenager\u2019s home life with her wrestling-obsessed family and burgeoning wrestling career over a year.\n\nIn 2012, the athlete adopted the stage name Paige.\n\nBiggest accolade\n\nIn 2014, she joined the WWE\u2019s main roster of wrestlers and became the youngest ever champion of the women\u2019s professional wrestling tournament, the WWE Divas Championship. In addition, she became the only woman to hold both Divas and NXT Women\u2019s Championships at the same time.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent following her win she said: \u201cI\u2019ve been working my whole career to get to this point, it\u2019s been nearly nine years now, and it was just incredible.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop crying, I haven\u2019t stopped talking to my family about it, it\u2019s overwhelming especially getting so much support from the fans and backstage. It\u2019s been magical.\u201d\n\nInjury and retirement\n\nFollowing a string of fights with fellow female wrestlers including Divas champion Nikki Bella and NXT Women\u2019s Champion Sasha Banks over the years, the wrester was issued an immediate 60-day suspension for a second violation of the WWE\u2019s wrestling company\u2019s anti-drug Talent Wellness Programme in October 2016. Her first suspension came on 17 August.\n\nThe same year, Paige underwent surgery to repair a herniated disc in her neck and returned to in-ring competitions in 2017. However, during her first match since June 2016, the wrestler experienced yet another injury and was forced to announce her retirement from in-ring fighting.\n\nThe two-time WWE Divas Champion announced the news in April 2018 on RAW After Mania in an emotional speech.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately due to neck injuries I can no longer perform as an in-ring competitor,\u201d she told spectators.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the hardest things I\u2019ll ever have to say in my entire career.\u201d\n\nBusiness launches\n\nMonths before her retirement, Paige announced she had launched an clothing line store titled Saraya, which sells a selection of women\u2019s fashion including shirts, hats and hoodies. She opened a store in Anaheim, California a year later.\n\nLess than 12 months passed before the wrestler-turned entrepreneur announced she had partnered with cosmetics brand Beauty Society to launch a cruelty-free, vegan cosmetics line which features lipsticks and eyeshadow palettes.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be absolutely huge,\u201d Paige announced to her 61.16k followers in an Instagram video on her brand\u2019s account.\n\nRumours of a comeback\n\nLast year, there was talk on social media among wrestling fans that former athlete might be considering a return to the sport.\n\nHowever, Paige quashed rumours on Twitter in November 2018, posting: \u201cNope. I\u2019m not. At all. One more knock to my neck could result in paralysis. Don\u2019t read \u201cfacts\u201d on the internet. As much as I want that to be true it\u2019s 100% not.\u201d", "description": "Former WWE professional wrestler Paige\u00a0has opened up about the negative impact a sex tape leak had on her mental health, explaining that she underwent therapy and suffered from \u201cstress-induced anorexia\u201d.
