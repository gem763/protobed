Candidates also need to have a 10 percent lead over their second-place rival to avoid a runoff vote in December. The winner will take office in January.\n\nAnalysts say a runoff could be detrimental to Morales's chances of securing a fourth term.\n\n\"In a second round, everything will be much more difficult for Morales,\" Penaranda said.\n\n\"He could lose as the opposition will de facto unite against him.\"\n\nA wall covered with election posters of Bolivia's President Evo Morales [Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters]\n\nMounting Criticism\n\nThe 59-year-old leader of the Movement for Socialism Party (MAS) has riled Bolivians by insisting on running for another five-year term, despite a 2016 referendum that ruled against his proposal to extend term limits.\n\nHe was able to run after the country's highest court ruled that term limits would violate his human rights.\n\nThe decision set off protests and strikes across the country, with opponents arguing the move was unconstitutional.\n\nSeveral corruption scandals and allegations of overspending have also dogged Morales's 13-year mandate over the landlocked Andean nation.\n\nLast year, he built a new presidential residence: A towering 29-story highrise in the administrative capital La Paz worth $34m.\n\nAnd in September, he built a $7m museum dedicated to himself in his hometown of Orinoca.\n\nMany voters are also outraged over his government's response to the wildfires this year that have consumed large swathes of the country's forests. Critics argue that the wildfires are partly the result of policies that have made it easier for farmers to clear land for cultivation.\n\nHundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding Morales declare the fires a national disaster to help facilitate international aid.\n\nBut his government refused, saying that declaring an emergency would invite foreign meddling in a sovereign issue.\n\nOpposition\n\nAmong the eight candidates challenging Morales, former President Carlos Mesa appears to have the best chance at unseating the leader or forcing a runoff vote.\n\nMesa, 65, is a former journalist and historian. He leads the Citizen Community alliance and is predicted to win about 27 percent of the vote in the first round.\n\nPresidential candidate Carlos Mesa surrounded by supporters in La Paz, Bolivia [David Mercado/Reuters]\n\nJim Shultz, executive director of the Democracy Center, says Mesa is the most serious challenger Morales has ever faced.\n\n\"Mesa is an intelligent and moderate candidate with a lot of middle-class support,\" Shultz said.\n\n\"He also commands the support of people who are disenchanted with Morales,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\nDuring his campaign, he accused Morales of authoritarianism and pledged to restore democracy to the country's institutions.\n\nI think we are left with very few options. We have a president who wants to remain in power unconstitutionally and a very weak opposition. Sara Jauregui, 30, a graphic designer in La Paz\n\nDan Delvy Vargas Beltran, 44, an architect from La Paz, believed Mesa's main objective was to bring back democracy.\n\n\"Because unfortunately, we have a government that controls all powers including electoral power,\" Vargas Beltran said.\n\nPundits, however, point to the fact that the opposition remains deeply divided and that if Mesa wins, he will preside over a weak government.\n\n\"I think we are left with very few options,\" said Sara Jauregui, 30, a graphic designer in La Paz.\n\n\"We have a president who wants to remain in power unconstitutionally and a very weak opposition,\" she said.\n\nBolivia's President Evo Morales surrounded by supporters during a campaign rally in La Paz [Courtesy of Bolivian Presidency/Via Reuters]\n\nStill Popular\n\nStill, despite growing anger over his re-election bid, Morales enjoys considerable support in Bolivia. He is credited with ushering in unprecedented economic prosperity and lowering inequality.\n\nUnlike neighbouring countries, Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, which are suffering from severe economic downturns, Bolivia's economy has grown an average of 4.6 percent since Morales took office, largely as a result of his moves to nationalise the oil and gas sectors and high commodity rates.\n\nLast year, the poverty rate in the country stood at 36.4 percent, compared with 59.9 percent in 2006 when Morales took office, according to the World Bank.\n\nMorales has also empowered Bolivia's more than four million indigenous people, helping alleviate their marginalisation by giving them greater access to education and services.\n\nJohn Crabtree, a researcher at the University of Oxford, said that although Morales has seen his popularity drop among the middle class and young voters, as well as in large cities, he maintains strong support among the indigenous populations and from his base in rural areas.\n\n\"Evo remains a very popular figure,\" Crabtree said.\n\n\"His popularity has waned a bit, but it is not the case that large numbers of people are desperate to get rid of him.\"\n\nWith additional reporting by Monica Garcia in La Paz.\n\n", "description": "As Morales's popularity wanes, Bolivians will head to polls Sunday to vote in what has already been a heated election.", "authors": ["Jihan Abdalla", "About The Author"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/864d606710384b529248bc6d6b85519f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
