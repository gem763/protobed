Katie Hill announced her resignation from Congress on October 27.\n\nThe California lawmaker has become engulfed in controversy since being accused of having an affair with her legislative director and admitting that she had a sexual relationship with a younger campaign staffer.\n\n\"It is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress,\" she wrote in a statement published to Twitter.\n\n\"This is what needs to happen so that the good people who supported me will no longer be subjected to the pain inflicted by my abusive husband and the brutality of hateful political operatives who seem to happily provide a platform to a monster who is driving a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation.\n\n\u2014Rep. Katie Hill (@RepKatieHill) October 27, 2019\n\nOn October 18, the right-wing news site RedState published a story alleging that Hill was involved in a two-year consensual sexual relationship with a campaign staffer and her husband, Kenny Heslep, who filed for divorce in July.\n\nRedState published screenshots of what appeared to be text messages between Heslep and the staffer, as well as a nude photo of Hill brushing the staffer's hair. The website also accused Hill of having a yearlong relationship with her legislative director, Graham Kelly.\n\nOn October 24, The Daily Mail also published nude photos of Hill with the campaign aide.\n\nHill, 32, said in a letter to constituents October 23 that her affair with the staffer was \"inappropriate\" but that she did not have a relationship with Kelly.\n\n\"During the final tumultuous years of my abusive marriage, I became involved in a relationship with someone on my campaign,\" Hill wrote. \"I know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment. For that I apologize. I wish nothing but the best for her and hope everyone respects her privacy in this difficult time.\"\n\nHill said the nude photos were published without her consent and suggested that her husband was behind their publication.\n\n\"I am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me,\" she wrote in the letter.\n\nThe congresswoman, who is openly bisexual, called the publication of the photos a \"coordinated effort to try to destroy me and the people close to me.\"\n\nHill has threatened to sue the Daily Mail, alleging that it published or nonconsensual pornography, known as revenge porn, which is illegal in California. Hill also accused the tabloid of defaming her by falsely reporting that her tattoo \u2014 which appears to be some form of an Iron Cross \u2014 is a \"Nazi-era\" image.\n\nHill's attorneys wrote in a cease-and-desist letter to the Daily Mail on October 24, obtained by Politico: \"You have also exposed your publication to grave legal consequences for California has some of the strongest criminal laws in the United States against the secretive generation and distribution of private, sexual images.\"\n\nThey added that \"the California Penal Code accordingly makes it a criminal offense to 'intentionally distribute the image of the intimate body part or parts of another identifiable person.'\"\n\nHill. Zach Gibson/Getty Images)\n\nThe House Ethics Committee said it opened an investigation into the allegations about Hill and Kelly, her House aide. Hill has denied having any sexual relationship with Kelly, which would be in violation of House rules. Hill's conduct with campaign aides falls outside the committee's jurisdiction.\n\nIn her letter, Hill said she was \"fully and proactively cooperating\" with the investigation.\n\nHill, a former executive at a homeless-advocacy organization, defeated a Republican incumbent in her conservative Los Angeles County district in 2018. She's the vice chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee said in a statement on Wednesday that \"the mere fact that it is investigating these allegations, and publicly disclosing its review, does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred, or reflect any judgment on behalf of the Committee.\"\n\nMany Republicans have condemned Hill's relationship with the campaign staffer \u2014 and some have called on her to resign.\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos, a former adviser to President Donald Trump who served time in federal prison for lying to federal law enforcement, said he was weighing a run against Hill in 2020.\n\n\"I have been reached out to by leaders who are helping other Republicans run in the state, and they think I have a great shot,\" he told Fox News. \"Running for Congress and winning is definitely a goal of mine.\"\n\nAt least one Republican has defended the congresswoman.\n\nIn a tweet, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida called the committee's investigation \"absurd\" and implied that the congresswoman was being investigated because of her sexuality.\n\n\"This is just absurd. The only person who seems to have a gripe is @RepKatieHill's soon-to-be ex,\" Gaetz wrote. \"Who among us would look perfect if every ex leaked every photo/text? Katie isn't being investigated by Ethics or maligned because she hurt anyone - it is because she is different.\"", "description": "Rep.
