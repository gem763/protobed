Trump slams central bank for having \u2018no guts.\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "The Federal Reserve made a modest reduction in interest rates Wednesday in an effort to keep the U.S. economy strong, a measured approach that stopped far short of the dramatic action President Trump has demanded for months.\n\nIn an extremely unusual move, Trump blasted the Fed\u2019s announcement just 25 minutes after it was made public, targeting Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell\u2019s leadership in particular.\n\n\u201cJay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, berating the Fed chair he handpicked. \u201cNo \u2018guts,\u2019 no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator.\u201d\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decision to lower its benchmark interest rate just shy of 2 percent, down from about 2.25 percent, brought into sharp contrast the competing views of the economy that are emanating from the White House and the central bank less than 14 months before the 2020 election.\n\nWhile Trump has insisted that most problems with the economy are squarely the Fed\u2019s fault, Powell on Wednesday said trade uncertainty was a key factor weighing on growth. Powell didn\u2019t single out Trump for causing the trade uncertainty, but many business executives and lawmakers have.\n\n\u201cTrade developments have been up and down and then up, I guess, or back up, perhaps over the course of this intervening period. In any case, they\u2019ve been quite volatile,\u201d Powell said at a news conference following the announcement of the new rate. \u201cWe do see those risks as actually more heightened now.\u201d\n\nStocks initially fell sharply after the Fed news as investors thought the central bank was signaling it would not cut again this year, but stocks rebounded amid speculation that the Fed might change course. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 36 points.\n\n\u201cHistory teaches us it\u2019s better to be proactive in adjusting policy if you can,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThe idea that if you see trouble approaching on the horizon, you steer away from it if you can.\"\n\nThe small, quarter-point reduction was meant to address fears about slowing growth in Europe and parts of Asia, as well as concerns that Trump\u2019s trade war with countries around the world would remain a drag on growth well into the future. The Fed said it would \u201cact as appropriate\u201d to keep the economy growing. But a majority of the Fed\u2019s voting members signaled they don\u2019t expect to lower interest rates again before the end of the year.\n\nThe quarter-point reduction Wednesday was widely expected but stood in sharp contrast to the \u201cbig\u201d cut Trump has recently advocated. Trump has called for lowering the benchmark rate to zero, or even pushing it negative as a way to lure investment to the United States.\n\nPowell on Wednesday largely ruled out supporting negative interest rates and suggested he would lower rates further only if there was evidence the economy was slowing.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decision, which was not unanimous, comes at a pivotal time for the central bank, the economy and the White House. Fed officials are trying to help keep the economy growing without fanning inflation or squelching growth. The economy is sending mixed signals about whether it might slow markedly next year or continue chugging along. And a strong economy is key to Trump\u2019s reelection effort in 2020. He has tried to frame the Fed as a primary culprit if there\u2019s any slowdown.\n\nFor decades, White House officials had largely avoided commenting directly on the Fed\u2019s monetary policy decisions, seeking to preserve the central bank\u2019s independence and credibility. Trump has shattered that norm and even asked aides whether he could replace Powell, a person he picked for the job in late 2017. Powell on Wednesday wouldn\u2019t respond to Trump\u2019s latest criticism, saying instead that the central bank made its decisions \u201cwithout regard to political considerations.\u201d\n\nOnly seven of the 17 Fed leaders penciled in another rate cut this year, according to economic forecasts released Wednesday. The rest predict rates will stay where they are \u2014 or rise.\n\nThe Fed painted a mostly upbeat picture of the economy, saying the job market remains \u201cstrong\u201d and consumer spending is \u201crising at a strong pace.\u201d The Fed predicts the economy will grow 2.2 percent this year, weaker than the roughly 3 percent target that White House officials have cited. The economy grew 2.9 percent in 2018.\n\n\u201cThe Fed wants to stop the economy from slipping into a recession, but Fed leaders aren\u2019t going to do anything to push growth higher,\u201d said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.\n\nFed leaders have characterized these rate cuts as insurance to protect the economy against the global slowdown and worsening trade war. Fed officials traditionally raise interest rates when the economy is growing as a way to combat inflation, and they tend to cut interest rates when they are guarding against a downturn as a way to try to provoke more borrowing and spending in the economy.\n\n\u201cAlthough household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports have weakened,\u201d the Fed wrote in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. economy is in a tricky place, and Fed leaders remain divided over what to do. Consumers keep spending, but the U.S. manufacturing sector is struggling and business investment has collapsed as many companies fear Trump\u2019s trade war won\u2019t be resolved anytime soon. His standoff with China has been a particular concern. The president has repeatedly dialed up and then dialed back threats and penalties against China, one of the world\u2019s largest economies, in the past year in an effort to force the country to make major changes to its economic relationship with the United States. Powell on Wednesday said trade risks are \u201cmore heightened now\u201d following new tariffs against Chinese imports.\n\n\u201cWe do feel trade uncertainty is having an effect,\u201d Powell said. Officials \u201csee it in weak business investment and weak exports.\u201d\n\nTrump has recently said he thinks he will reach a deal with China, but it might not come until after the 2020 elections. He has already imposed tariffs on more than $250 billion in Chinese imports and larger penalties are set to kick in next month and then even more in December.\n\nSome economists have questioned whether the Fed should be reducing rates at all given how healthy the economic fundamentals look. Two out of the 10 members of the Fed\u2019s committee that determines interest rates voted against the cut, preferring to leave rates unchanged. On the flip side, one member dissented against the latest decision because he felt the Fed should have cut rates by half a percentage point.\n\n\u201cPowell has the votes for a quarter-point cut, but he can\u2019t commit to anything else,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. \u201cHe can\u2019t promise additional rate cuts, which will disappoint the market.\u201d\n\nSince the Fed\u2019s last meeting, on July 31, Trump has tweeted or retweeted 43 times criticizing the central bank and calling for deeper rate cuts. He has called Powell a \u201cbonehead\u201d and \u201cenemy\u201d for not lowering rates faster.\n\nOn top of political pressures, the Fed faced an unusual situation this week where the interest rate on overnight loans to banks spiked above 8 percent, well above the Fed\u2019s target and the highest level since the last financial crisis. Powell downplayed concerns about the situation and said the central bank would continue to pump a bit more money into the system to get the rate back down under 2 percent.\n\nRead more:\n\nU.S. economy is \u2018relatively strong\u2019 and doesn\u2019t need lower interest rates, key Fed leader says\n\nThe Trump vs. Obama economy \u2014 in 15 charts\n\nTrump calls the Fed chair an \u2018enemy\u2019 after Powell said trade war is \u2018turbulent\u2019", "description": "The U.S. benchmark interest rate is now just shy of 2 percent, down from about 2.25 percent.
