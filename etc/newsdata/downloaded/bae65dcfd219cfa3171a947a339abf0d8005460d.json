That is an increase of 1.8 percent in sales and 4.3 percent in operating profit from the same period last year.\n\nSales were highest ever for a third quarter, while operating profit was way more than the market expectation of W600-W650 billion. Total sales for the first three quarters also amounted to a record W46.24 trillion.\n\nThe final results will be out at the end of the month.\n\nHome appliances led the boom with an estimated sales of over W5 trillion. Except air conditioners, most home appliances sold more than expected.\n\nNew high-tech products such as clothing-care gadgets and air purifiers continued to be in high demand, and so did its premium brand of products. In the TV business, the decreased cost of raw LCD panels helped boost operating profit along with increased sales. But LG's smartphone business has posted losses for the 18th quarter running after new models once again flopped.\n\nBut the losses were slashed in half compared to the previous quarter as the company moved its smartphone production to Vietnam earlier this year in a bid to reduce costs.\n\n", "description": "LG Posts Bumper Results for Q3", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
