On those first few interviews he did before \u201cJoker\u201d went to Venice and startled everyone by winning the Golden Lion, he was poised to walk out of the room on the wrong question. Now he\u2019s used to the way the R-rated, controversy-magnet \u201cJoker\u201d pushes people\u2019s buttons \u2014 and inspires raves and Oscar talk. Having acted since he was eight (he\u2019s notched three Oscar nominations for \u201cGladiator,\u201d \u201cWalk the Line,\u201d and \u201cThe Master\u201d), Phoenix is poised for his fourth.\n\nOf course, he says he doesn\u2019t read his interviews or reviews. And he\u2019s uncomfortable at \u201ctributes\u201d like the one at the Toronto International Film Festival, where he refused to wait for Willem Dafoe to say nice things about him amid applause. Instead, he rushed the stage to hang out with his friend and thank his family and brother River Phoenix who made him watch \u201cRaging Bull\u201d two days in a row: \u201cYou\u2019re going to start acting again,\u201d River told him. \u201cThis is what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nTravis Bickle and Martin Scorsese references are all over \u201cJoker,\u201d a script written by \u201cHangover\u201d writer-director Todd Phillips and \u201cThe Fighter\u201d co-writer Scott Silver. Scorsese was going to produce it at one point; his producer Emma Tillinger Koskoff continued at the helm when he became overloaded by \u201cThe Irishman.\u201d And Robert De Niro plays a talk show host in \u201cJoker\u201d close to Jerry Lewis\u2019 role in \u201cThe King of Comedy.\u201d\n\nPhoenix had no idea what to make of \u201cJoker\u201d when he first read it. But the more he went over it with Phillips, and shared the possibilities of what he might do with the troubled character of Arthur Fleck \u2014 an undernourished, beaten-down, sad-sack smoking clown with a sick mom, a rich fantasy life, and a dangerous desire for attention \u2014 the more he realized he had to face his fear.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t come up with any answers,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what made me feel I had to do it. I felt overwhelmed and terrified by it. Usually when I\u2019m scared of something, it makes me feel like I have to go towards it. I had so many mixed feelings about the character. And I like that. I don\u2019t think we have enough of that in movies, particularly in a superhero genre movie. I hate the idea of labeling something, just mostly because I don\u2019t really know what the genres are.\u201d\n\nWhat Phoenix does know, whether it\u2019s with Paul Thomas Anderson (\u201cThe Master\u201d) or Gus Van Sant (\u201cDon\u2019t Worry, He Won\u2019t Get Far on Foot\u201d), is how to go someplace different. \u201cI\u2019m looking for whatever seems truthful, to inhabit this world, trying to find some kind of reality,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with this fictional world, fictional characters. Todd managed to weave those two ideas together effortlessly: On the one hand it felt visceral vivid and real, and on the other hand it paid homage to the Batman myth. It was an interesting way to explore the character.\u201d\n\nThe actor pushed and tested Phillips, as he does with all his directors. \u201cAfter reading through the script a few times, I never picked it up again,\u201d he said. \u201cHe sent me two rewrites I never read until I got to New York a month early. I read through the script with Todd and Scott, talked about what their intentions were for a scene, what I wanted to do, and if it matched up with their idea. In hindsight, I realize I\u2019m testing the boundaries to see how far the writer-director is willing to go with it.\u201d\n\nPhoenix was embarrassed to bring up his \u201cstupid\u201d dancing idea until he got to New York. \u201cI wonder if there should be some kind of, like, dancing,\u201d he told Phillips.\n\n\u201cLike what\u2019s in the script?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole dance sequence in the script at the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t read the new script.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Phoenix and Phillips started to get on the same page. Like the pivotal public bathroom scene following the Joker\u2019s first kills on the subway, when shooting three bullies makes him feel better. \u201cAs we went through the rehearsal process, we always struggled with the scene that was there,\u201d said Phoenix. \u201cHe\u2019s out of breath, he hides the gun, and looks in the mirror and says a line. We couldn\u2019t identify what it was, and got to set to shoot it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Phillips, it was day seven. \u201cFuck, we never figured this out,\u201d Phoenix told the director. \u201cWe never talked about it.\u201d", "description": "Phoenix tells IndieWire that he worked telepathically with director Todd Phillips to create his anorexic clown, and it added layers to the script.", "authors": ["Anne Thompson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dqGbnisN_AuRtoXPIG4lNQ--~B/aD02Mzc7dz05MDU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/indiewire_268/01b50ad3b0dd3047ca576694730947c7", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
