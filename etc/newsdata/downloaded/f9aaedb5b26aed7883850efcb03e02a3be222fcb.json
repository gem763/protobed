But that isn\u2019t justice. Justice requires consequences for those who tarnished the man and lied to Senate Judiciary investigators and committee members.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, we\u2019re still waiting. We\u2019re still waiting for that flash of righteous indignation you showcased during the confirmation hearings of now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh to turn into action. You know, when you turned to your Democrat colleagues and seethed that their efforts to \u201cdestroy this guy\u2019s life\u201d were \u201cthe most despicable things that I have seen in politics.\u201d We\u2019re still waiting for that tie-straightening smile in the face of protestors to turn into . . . something.\n\nYes, Kavanaugh was confirmed. But that isn\u2019t justice. Justice requires consequences for those who tarnished the man and lied to Senate Judiciary investigators and committee members. Justice requires consequences for Christine Blasey Ford and her handlers.\n\nYour inaction has so inspired the left that not even a year after Ford professed to senators, while under oath, that she was not \u201cacting out of partisan political motives\u201d in testifying that Kavanaugh had attempted to rape her while they were both high school students, Ford\u2019s attorney Debra Katz felt no qualms about telling an audience that Roe v. Wade was part of Ford\u2019s motivation.\n\n\u201cWe were going to have a conservative\u201d justice, Katz told a University of Baltimore audience, \u201cbut he will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scapel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is. We know his character. And we know what motivates him. And that is important. It is important that we know. And that is part of what motivated Christine.\u201d\n\nRevelations of Katz\u2019s statements prompted Sen. Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to suggest the Justice Department probe Ford\u2019s testimony before the committee. Tillis \u201csaid the newly revealed remarks seem to undermine Ms. Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony, when she insisted she was reluctant to come forward and was only motivated by the assault she said she suffered.\u201d\n\nAnd now thanks to Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino\u2019s tenacious investigative reporting, we know that\n\nwithin days of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court . . . Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s father was approached by Ford\u2019s father at the golf club where they are both members. Ralph Blasey, Ford\u2019s father, went out of his way to offer to Ed Kavanaugh his support of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court, according to multiple people familiar with the conversation that took place at Burning Tree Club in Bethesda, Maryland. \u2018I\u2019m glad Brett was confirmed,\u2019 Ralph Blasey told Ed Kavanaugh, shaking his hand. Blasey added that the ordeal had been tough for both families.\n\nAs Hemingway and Severino\u2014authors of the bestseller about the Kavanaugh confirmation battle, \u201cJustice on Trial\u201d\u2014pointed out, Ford\u2019s father \u201cpresumably wouldn\u2019t have supported the nomination of a man he believed tried to rape his daughter.\u201d\n\nSo, now in addition to the many contradictions and inconsistencies in Ford\u2019s testimony, as well as the evidence that Ford lied about whether she had provided guidance to anyone on taking a polygraph test, there is evidence Ford lied about her apolitical motivation in coming forward\u2014and to top it off, her own family didn\u2019t even believe her.\n\nFord isn\u2019t going away. She just laid low long enough to feel safe, as did Kavanaugh\u2019s other putative accusers and the liberal press. So emboldened are the left now that The New York Times dares to tweet out that \u201chaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn\u2019t belong at Yale in the first place.\u201d\n\nThat tweet teased a Times essay by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, reporters and authors of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.\u201d That essay proves the damage done by Graham and the other pantywaist politicians who refused to punctuate their conclusion that Ford had lied about Kavanaugh with a perjury investigation.\n\nNow we have the Times, a soon-to-be released supposedly investigative book, and Ramirez, all pushing as fact that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her, even though Ramirez herself initially was \u201creluctant to characterize Kavanaugh\u2019s role in the alleged incident with certainty.\u201d It was only \u201cafter six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney\u201d that Ramirez decided, yes, Kavanaugh had been the perpetrator of that alleged assault that had occurred 35 years earlier, when she was intoxicated. That other witnesses unequivocally contradicted Ramirez\u2019s claims and no one verified her account is obscured in the news stories.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Times is now reporting that during Kavanaugh\u2019s freshman year at Yale University, a classmate named Max Stier \u201csaw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\u201d According to the article, Stier contacted the FBI about the purported incident, but it was never investigated. What the article fails to mention, however, is that Stier served as one of President Bill Clinton\u2019s attorneys during the Whitewater investigation, at a time when Kavanaugh worked on Ken Starr\u2019s independent counsel report.\n\nThe left isn\u2019t done. They aren\u2019t nearly done. They will continue to hound Kavanaugh, either to twist him into a virtue-signaling pro-Roe vote, or to caution future conservative nominees to stay clear of the Supreme Court, or they\u2019re coming for you.\n\nIt\u2019s still not too late, however, for Graham to put a stop to this charade. Prior to stepping down from Grassley\u2019s Judiciary Committee position, Sen. Chuck Grassley laid all the groundwork necessary to investigate Ford and McClean, and Graham now has even more lines of inquiry to pursue. Even more fodder will likely lie in \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,\u201d which is scheduled for release later this week.\n\nWhile the authors claim they \u201cfound Dr. Ford\u2019s allegations credible during a 10-month investigation,\u201d what they likely unearthed instead were more inconsistencies and evidence that Ford lied because, as her Senate testimony confirmed, she couldn\u2019t keep her story straight even if Roe depended on it.", "description": "Yes, Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed.
