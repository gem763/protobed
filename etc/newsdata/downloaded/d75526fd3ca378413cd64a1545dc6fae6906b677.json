After telling Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Thursday night that no, he didn\u2019t have his own \u201cshadow Ukraine agenda,\u201d and in fact that it was the State Department that had asked him to meddle in foreign policy affairs, he got up early to stay on message.\n\nWith evidently very little sleep, Giuliani was back at Fox studios on the couch with Fox & Friends hosts Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt, and Brian Kilmeade bragging that the infamous transcript of the July 25 conversation between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president had been read to him. (The text is purportedly being released by the White House sometime today.)\n\n\u201cWhen you read the conversation, there\u2019s no mention of $250 million, there\u2019s no mention of military aid, there\u2019s no quid pro quo,\u201d Giuliani stated as Doocy tried to clarify.\n\n\u201cThis is the transcript?\u201d he asked while Giuliani continued on unabated.\n\nKilmeade then made an attempt, touching the mayor\u2019s arm to get him to pause. \u201cSo can I just back up for a second? Mr. Mayor, can I ask you, did you read the transcript?\u201d\n\nGiuliani then stopped and smiled. \u201cUh, let\u2019s say it was read to me.\u201d\n\nKilmeade asked for further clarification. \u201cIt was read to you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole thing?\u201c\n\nAfter a moment\u2019s pause, Giuliani responded, \u201cUh, I hope so!\u201d\n\nAnd then he was off again, sticking up for his client and accusing the Obama administration of dereliction of duty.\n\n\u201cIf the president hadn\u2019t discussed the things he discussed with the president of the Ukraine, he\u2019d be a president like Obama who closed his eyes to corruption,\u201d he said, pivoting to accusing the 44th president of possibly having a role in alleged and unproven wrongdoing by Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nHe then went on to say that only Trump could have raised the issue of corruption with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cNow who else can raise it with the president of the Ukraine?\u201d Giuliani asked. \u201cThe head of the FBI can\u2019t call the head of the Ukraine and talk to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I needed something done with the Italian government when I was investigating the mafia, Ronald Reagan made the calls to the president of Italy, not me,\u201d he offered by way of precedent on such matters.\n\nThen Kilmeade cut to the chase. \u201cSo the president did bring up Joe Biden on the calls?\u201d\n\nGiuliani then hesitated. \u201cEr, maybe he didn\u2019t bring it up,\u201d he said with a belly laugh. \u201cCould be possible the president of the Ukraine brought it up.\u201d", "description": "The Trump lawyer continued on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d early, asking \u201cwhat did Obama know and when did he know it\u201d and suggesting it was Ukraine\u2019s president who brought up the Bidens.", "authors": ["Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_720,w_1280,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569417466/Giuliani_PIC2_n4zito", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
