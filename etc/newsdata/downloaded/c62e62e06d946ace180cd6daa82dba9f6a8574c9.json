It's not a radical overhaul but a series of incremental improvements.\n\nThe new Audi R8 V10 is the German firm's fastest and most powerful car ever. Ray Massey got behind the wheel of a car that's engaging and fun to drive, but also suave and sophisticated\n\nAudi has reduced the weight, tweaked the suspension, sharpened up the styling and design, including a wider and flatter single-frame grille and increased the power by around 30 horsepower.\n\nAnd in a year which celebrates a decade of its V10 R8, Audi even has a limited edition Decennium model \u2013 of which 10 are earmarked for the UK.\n\nI had the chance last week to get behind the wheel of a very engaging, fun to drive, but also quite suave and sophisticated two-seater R8 Coupe V10 Performance Carbon Black, one in the magnificent seven line-up of new R8 coupes and open-topped Spyders.\n\nAudi has released a magnificent seven line-up of new R8 coupes and open-topped Spyders - and included in that is a limited edition \u00a3171,000 Decennium model to mark the 10th birthday of its super-car. Just 10 will be available in the UK\n\nIts aerodynamic looks are eye-catching and bold without being over the top.\n\nIn fact, the quite fetching new Ascari Blue metallic paintwork matched to a carbon-fibre side blade had the feeling of a smart but casual jacket, shirt and chinos at a relaxed ocean-side party.\n\nIt attracts attention, but not too much. It's a super-car with an understated side.\n\nAnd that's even with the large glass screen behind you which displays the vast hand-built naturally-aspirated 5.2 litre V10 engine linked to a slick 7-speed dual clutch S-tronic automatic gear-box that develops a whopping 620 horsepower \u2013 equivalent to six Ford Fiestas.\n\nEven with the large glass screen behind you displaying its 5.2 litre V10 - which develops a whopping 620 horsepower - the new R8 is a super-car with an understated side\n\nThat blended look of power and panache was matched too by the driving. This very powerful mid-engined car can accelerate with gusto from rest to 62mph in a flash-like 3.1 seconds and continue well past that up to a top speed of 205mph, where permitted.\n\nBut the R8 also demonstrates good manners at slower speeds \u2013 even in 30mph zones - and the speed drops almost as quickly when you take your foot of the accelerator as it increases when you depress the pedal.\n\nThe base price of the car I was driving starts from \u00a3154,100 but, loaded with enough extras to buy a decent small run-around hatchback \u2013 at \u00a315,780 worth - the final price as driven came in at \u00a3169,880.\n\nThis included LED laser light headlamps (\u00a33,150), dynamic steering (\u00a31,350), a full leather package (\u00a32,900), Alcantara diamond headliner (\u00a32,500), and sports seats in black nappa leather with rock-grey stitched diamond design (\u00a3475), and a Bang and Olufsen sound system (\u00a31,750).\n\nPushing the red start button alerts all around I'm fired up and ready to roll with a satisfying roar\n\nOnce settled into the supportive racing-style driving seat, I pressed the red start button on the multi-function steering wheel. The V10 comes alive and a satisfying roar that alerts all around that I'm fired up and ready to roll.\n\nIt's a very cossetting interior with a smart, functional very Audi-esque digital dashboard and trim. The sports seats are very supportive and comfortable, even over long journeys, as I had the chance to do both along country lanes around the Cotswolds and general motorway driving.\n\nThe ride can be a bit hard and firm on Britain's increasingly pot-holed roads. But the R8 cruises beautifully and effortlessly on decently maintained highways with wonderful grip, and feels well balanced whether driving solo or with a passenger on board.\n\n'The ride can be a bit hard and firm on Britain's increasingly pot-holed roads. But the R8 cruises beautifully and effortlessly on decently maintained highways with wonderful grip'\n\nI was riding on the larger 20 inch black anthracite forged aluminium wheels, whereas 19 inch is standard across the range.\n\nIt's when you press the pedal to the metal and feel the controlled but exhilarating rush of speed that you realise the power you have at your command.\n\nOn twisting country lanes, the various stability control and safety features keep you glued to the road. Just as well.\n\nCareful how you pack, mind, if you're contemplating taking more than a credit card and a tooth-brush with you.\n\nPop the bonnet and there's space underneath in a sunken bay for a standard sized airline cabin bag and a little - but not much - more. Maybe a folded bulky coat. But you'll have to take out the puncture repair kit.\n\nHowever - be careful how you pack if you're planning on taking more than a credit card and a tooth-brush with you. There's no room in the R8 for anything bulky, so travel light\n\nInside, behind the driver and tucked directly behind the passenger seats, is a cabin with series of soft pouches into which you can pop small bags and coats, but nothing bulky. So if you're touring, travel light.\n\nThe new revised Audi R8 Coupe is competing in a highly competitive supercar market against the likes of a pair of British challengers in the form of McLaren's 570S Coupe and Aston Martin's DB11, while among others you can add the Ferrari Portofino convertible to the rivals in the cabriolet market.\n\nThe coupe range starts from \u00a3128,295 for the R8 V10 quattro with 570PS, up to \u00a3171,795 for the limited edition 620PS Decennium special edition, of which 222 will be sold globally, including 10 in the UK.\n\nThe convertible Spyders start from \u00a3136,985 for the V10 quattro 570PS, up to \u00a3162,885 for the V10 Performance Carbon Black soft\u2014tops.\n\nThe cars are hand-built by Audi Sport at their Audi Boellinger Hoefen facility, in Heilbron, Germany, which employs 500 people.\n\nThe new R8 V10 convertible Spyder starts at \u00a3136,985, with the price going up to \u00a3162,885 for the Performance Carbon Black soft-top. The cars are hand-built in Heilbron, Germany\n\nBut don't expect to get the applause of eco-warriors. With fuel economy of under 22 miles per gallon and CO2 emissions topping 298g/km, this V10 really is a politically-incorrect gas guzzler and filling that vast 73 litre petrol tank (up to 83 litres on some models) will keep money circulating in the economy.\n\nAnd with insurance in the stratospheric 50E category, I dread to think how high the premiums will be. Meanwhile, first year road tax is \u00a32,070.\n\nBut I imagine this won't be of too much concern to the average brand new R8 buyer. If you can afford the car, you can afford the tax and insurance.\n\nNow where is the marvellous Tony Stark when you need him?", "description": "You don\u2019t have to be Iron Man to drive Audi\u2019s latest iteration of its 200mph-plus R8 supercar.
