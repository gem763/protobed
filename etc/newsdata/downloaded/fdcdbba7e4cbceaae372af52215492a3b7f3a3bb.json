The Nigerian has scored seven in nine Ligue 1 games, as well as assisting twice.\n\nHis form doesn't make good reading for Antoine Kombouare's Toulouse side. They're 18th in the table and only Monaco have conceded more goals.\n\nKoumbouare was last week announced as Toulouse boss when Alain Casanova quit the club after a series of reported death threats made towards him and his family.\n\nKoumbouare, a former PSG defender, kept Dijon in Ligue 1 last season but opted against extending his stay there.\n\nVictor Osimhen (left) has been in sparkling form for Lille, scoring seven Ligue 1 goals so far\n\nMetz v Nantes\n\nSaturday, 7pm\n\nThey're rooted to the bottom of the table and they haven't won at home since August.\n\nTo make things worse for Metz, they welcome the season's surprise package so far in Nantes.\n\nChristian Gourcouff took the Brittany club in August, deploying a 4-4-2 formation to great effect, giving his team the springboard to take up second place in the league having won five games by a single goal.\n\nNantes have enjoyed a brilliant start to the Ligue 1 season and could take top spot this weekend\n\nThey are just two points behind PSG and have already beat the likes of Nice and Lyon, so Metz face an uphill battle.\n\nNicolas Pallois has been a rock in central defence for the Brittany side but will miss the game through suspension, as will former Manchester United man Fabio.\n\nMetz are currently propping up the division having won just twice so far this season\n\nBordeaux v St Etienne\n\nSunday, 2pm - Live on BT Sport Extra 2\n\nClaude Puel enjoyed a dream start in charge of Saint Etienne before the international break as they collected a late win over bitter rivals Lyon in the Rhonalpin Derby.\n\nThe former Leicester City manager will travel to the west coast with his new side having had two weeks with a majority of them over the international break.\n\nThey've won two on the bounce now in the league but are up against a Bordeaux side who are vying for a finish in the European places.\n\nExperienced strikers Jimmy Briand and Nicolas de Preville have both fired home three times this season for a side that knows how to find the net.\n\nFormer Arsenal captain Laurent Koscielny plays for Bordeaux after joining them in the summer from the Gunners.\n\nFormer Leicester City manager Claude Puel is now in charge at Ligue 1 club Saint-Etienne\n\nMonaco v Rennes\n\nSunday, 4pm - Live on BT Sport Extra 2\n\nHe knows his way around Ligue 1 having spent over five years at Toulouse and Wissam Ben-Yedder has hit the ground running since his move from Sevilla this summer, grabbing six goals in seven appearances.\n\nThe new Monaco striker and his side have no trouble finding the net, scoring 15, but early-season indications show that Leonardo Jardim has failed to mend the leaky defence that saw Thierry Henry lose his job in January.\n\nThe principality club have conceded 19 times this season, the worst in the league by a margin of four goals. Their only clean sheet came at Reims when the sides drew 0-0.\n\nWissam Ben-Yedder celebrates scoring for Monaco in their Cote d'Azur derby against Nice\n\nBut Rennes are in uninspiring form, having picked up just six points since their shock defeat of PSG in August.\n\nFormer AC Milan and Watford man M'Baye Niang could look to exploit the Monaco defence, having scored four already in all competitions this season, but what's certain is the three points are well and truly up for grabs.\n\nMarseille v Strasbourg\n\nSunday, 8pm - Live on BT Sport 1\n\nSupporters at the Stade Velodrome seemed to be beginning to warm to former Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas after consecutive wins against Nice, St Etienne and Monaco.\n\nBut there's a strange atmosphere at Marseille now with the side, who are eighth in Ligue 1, struggling to create opportunities in the absence of former West Ham man Dimitri Payet.\n\nHe will be serving the last instalment of a four-game ban after he was sent off against Montpellier.\n\nStrasbourg are hovering dangerously over the relegation zone, only outside it because they've conceded fewer goals than Toulouse in 18th.", "description": "Early pace-setters PSG raise the curtain on the 10th week of Ligue 1 football on Friday evening with a trip to the French Riviera, but it will be no holiday.", "authors": ["Leigh Mcmanus For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/11/19880362-0-image-a-10_1571395652908.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
