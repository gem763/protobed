This could be triggered by a negative growth shock, geopolitical even, major credit event, or a normalisation in term premiums.\u201d\n\nThere is also a risk that prices could tumble if yields on high-quality government bonds were to rise from their extremely low levels, if investors start to worry about emerging inflationary pressures despite tepid economic activity.\n\n\u201cSome asset holders may not be well prepared for such repricing, given a general increase in risk-taking in the low interest rate environment\u201d, the Review warns. \u201cThis raises the prospect of large losses and reactive sales of assets, including by leveraged investors facing margin calls.\u201d\n\nEven if investors remain indifferent to investment risk, asset prices could come under pressure from a global economic slowdown.\n\nThat\u2019s because the rise in asset prices over the past decade has occurred in tandem with an increase in global debt, leaving many households and corporates more vulnerable to adverse shocks.\n\n\u201cA sharp slowdown in growth could undermine global financial stability, including by reducing the capacity of highly leveraged borrowers to service their debts\u201d, the Review warns.\n\nIt also points to the growing vulnerabilities of the massive US corporate debt market, where companies with higher debt levels, and lower interest cover account for more of the bonds issued.\n\nAs the Review notes, there is a risk that fund managers with mandates that require them to own bonds of a certain quality could be forced to sell large quantities of those bonds if companies suffer even a small rating downgrade.\n\nIn addition, certain sections of the US corporate bond market have suffered a deterioration in credit.\n\n\u201cLeveraged loans, which are loans extended to speculative grade or already highly leveraged firms, have also expanded rapidly in recent years\u201d, the Review notes.", "description": "The Reserve Bank has sounded a warning bell about investor complacency at a time when the global economic outlook is deteriorating.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1932%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ad956f2976d8eb52b7f55397c86c472798910f72", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
