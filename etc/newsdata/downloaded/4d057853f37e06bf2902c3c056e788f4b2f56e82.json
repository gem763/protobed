Pictures of the ships in Sydney's famous harbour were splashed on the front pages of China's state-controlled press.\n\nIn the months that have passed, conspiracies have circulated in Sydney's finance and banking sector about whether a substantial trade deal was done behind the scenes between the Morrison Government and Chinese President Xi Jinping, a more assertive Communist Party leader than his predecessors.\n\nForeign policy experts, including China critic Professor Clive Hamilton and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, are concerned Australia's major parties are afraid of offending Beijing.\n\nChina is also Australia's biggest trading partner and a major buyer of iron ore and university education.\n\nFour months on from that unannounced visit, concerns about Chinese influence in Australia have only grown.\n\nChinese students have been monitored at university campuses, especially those advocating for democracy in Hong Kong.\n\nThe timing of the visit - Monday, June 3 - coincided with eve of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing\n\nWhat did Penny Wong ask instead in Senate estimates instead? While China's human rights abuses, Hong Kong pro-democracy protests and the disputed South China Sea were discussed, the issue of the Chinese warships wasn't raised once at Budget estimates. Instead, Labor's foreign affairs frontbencher Penny Wong spent half an hour on Thursday pursuing Foreign Minister Marise Payne and her department secretary Frances Adamson about the 2016 US presidential election. She doggedly wanted to know about whether Australian taxpayers would be funding legal help for former foreign minister and Liberal leader Alexander Downer. As Australia's high commissioner to the United Kingdom in 2016, Mr Downer had drinks in London with George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump when he was the Republican Party's presidential candidate. This led to the revelation the Trump campaign possibly knew about a Russian 'dirt file' on his Democrat opponent Hillary Clinton - sparking a Department of Justice inquiry headed by special counsel Robert Mueller. 'Is the Australian government providing any support to Mr Downer in relation to this investigation,' Senator Wong asked. 'Why is that a secret? It's public money.' Senator Wong also pursued foreign affairs officials about Australia's ambassador to the United States, Joe Hockey, writing a letter in May to the American Attorney-General William Barr offering help to the Trump Administration with regards to the investigation into the 2016 election.\n\nKaila Murnain lost her job as Labor's general secretary in New South Wales, after an Independent Commission Against Corruption hearing in August revealed she knew about her party accepting a $100,000 donation in an Aldi shopping bag linked to Communist Party-connected billionaire Huang Xiangmo.\n\nThe Labor Party has been reluctant to seek answers on why the Chinese frigates sailed into Sydney Harbour.\n\nThe Opposition's foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong, who hails from Labor's left faction, didn't pursue the issue in Senate Budget estimates committees last week.\n\nThe Labor Opposition failed to ask even one question about this on either Wednesday or Thursday, as it grilled senior executive public servants from the Defence and Foreign Affairs departments.\n\nThe Senate committee instead spent its time questioning Defence officials about building cladding and ship building in Adelaide.\n\nDaily Mail Australia understands Senator Wong wanted other issues raised instead of this surprise visit of Chinese frigates.\n\nWhile China's human rights abuses, Hong Kong pro-democracy protests and the disputed South China Sea were discussed, the issue of the Chinese warships wasn't asked about once.\n\nInstead, Senator Wong spent half an hour on Thursday pursuing Foreign Minister Marise Payne and her department secretary Frances Adamson about the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nEven though only senators could ask questions on the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, Senator Wong's spokesman referred Daily Mail Australia to Labor's defence spokesman Richard Marles, who sits in the House of Representatives.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr Marles, Labor's deputy leader, said Opposition senators were unable to ask every question they wanted to, adding there could be another opportunity by the end of the year as Defence officials were grilled again.\n\nThe Labor Opposition failed to ask one question about the Chinese naval visit (Sydney's Garden Island pictured) on either Wednesday or Thursday, as it grilled executive public servants from the defence and foreign affairs departments\n\n'Pending the committee's approval, Labor would welcome the opportunity of a spill over day for Defence estimates,' she told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'Any opportunity for a spill over day would be used by Labor to raise questions on the issues which are keenly in the public's interest.\n\n'Labor will use estimates to hold the government to account.'\n\nLiberal senator Con\u00adcetta Fierravanti-Wells in June slammed her own side of politics for allowing the Chinese warships visit in June.\n\n'Scott Morrison's cabinet of groupthinkers and those responsible for the decision have sought refuge\u00ad in appeasement,' she wrote in a column for The Australian.\n\n'They were totally outmanoeuvred by Beijing.'\n\nNew South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian knew nothing of the visit, but a troupe of flag-waving Chinese citizens (pictured) were on hand to greet the ships as they docked at Garden Island\n\nDespite raising those concerns, Senator Fierravanti-Wells also failed to raise that issue on Wednesday or Thursday, even though she is a member of this parliamentary committee charged with probing Defence and Foreign Affairs officials.\n\nDaily Mail Australia contacted her for a response.\n\nClive Hamilton, a professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University's Canberra campus, said there was 'no doubt' backbench MPs and senators from both sides of politics were pressured into refraining from asking questions about China's defence interests.\n\n'What is illustrates is the Morrison Government have become ultra-sensitive about doing anything that Beijing might take offence to,' he told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nProfessor Hamilton, the author of Silent Invasion: China's Influence In Australia, said the government 'seems to have clamped down on those backbenchers who wanted to express their concern about continuing Chinese Communist Party influence in Australia and in the Pacific'.\n\nInstead, Labor's foreign affairs frontbencher Penny Wong (pictured) spent half an hour on Thursday pursuing Foreign Minister Marise Payne and her department secretary Frances Adamson about the 2016 US presidential election\n\nProfessor Hamilton said there appeared to be an arrangement between the major parties to tone down any criticism of China, adding there were MPs tainted by Chinese donations.\n\n'Both sides of politics are politically compromised by their dealings with wealthy donors and having people in the party who are agents of influence,' he said.\n\n'Generally, there's a kind of truce between the two major parties that \"we won't attack you if don't attack us\" and we've seen that over and over again.\n\n'An understanding: I wouldn't call it a conspiracy.'\n\nThe Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank said China gained a lot more from the surprise visit to Sydney than Australia did.\n\nLiberal senator Con\u00adcetta Fierravanti-Wells in June slammed her own side of politics for allowing the Chinese visit on the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. This week, she failed to raise this matter with Defence chiefs in Senate estimates\n\n'One of the most common arguments in favour of military-to-military relations between the Australian Defence Force and the People's Liberation Army is that such exchanges are supposed to improve the ADF's understanding of the PLA and vice versa,' researcher Charlie Lyons Jones told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'It's worth asking what the ADF got out of the visit because that, to me, seems unclear.'\n\nASPI's director of defence, strategy and national security Michael Shoebridge said Australia needed to fear President Xi and be wary of defence arrangements with China.\n\n'The Australian public is well ahead of both sides of politics in understanding that it is not in Australia's interest to increase the military capability or influence of the PLA either through research in our universities or through our direct defence relationship,' he said.\n\nHe added that China's authoritarian regime was 'using its political, strategic, technological and economic power in the world in ways that are against Australia's national interests, both in our region and inside Australia domestically'.", "description": "The surprise arrival of Chinese warships in Sydney Harbour remains a mystery - after senators from both major parties failed to ask Defence and Foreign Affairs officials about it.", "authors": ["Stephen Johnson For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/07/20118172-0-image-a-13_1571899213865.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
