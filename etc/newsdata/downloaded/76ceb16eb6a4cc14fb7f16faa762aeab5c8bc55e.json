Keith Earls attempts to wiggle his way through the smallest of gaps near the halfway line but the door is closed just in time. The Irish keeping their foot on the pedal here. 26 min: Ireland 21-5 Samoa (Lam try) Samoa beat Ireland at their own game as they deploy the rolling maul to devastating effect. After picking and going for a few phases, the Samoans eventually break the resistence of their opponents' defence. Captain Jack Lam is the man who dots down. TRY! Jack Lam gets Samoa on the scoreboard! 25 min: Ireland 21-0 Samoa Samoa with a penalty after catching Ireland on the break. They've got the throw-in five metres out from their opponents' white line... Advertisement 23 min: Ireland 21-0 Samoa Jordan Larmour looking on form tonight. He's just whizzed past another cluster of blue shirts, taking possession up to the half-way line before one of the Samoans eventually manages to wrap him up into a bundle. 21 min: Ireland 21-0 Samoa (Sexton try and conversion) Jordan Larmour injected the attack down the right with a shot of lightening pace, cutting inward, dancing and shifting his way past the Samoans to make the line break. Rather than going it alone, though, he made the simplest of offloads to Johnny Sexton in support who did the rest from 10 metres out. Superb. The fly-half with the extras too. TRY! Johnny Sexton crashes over for Ireland! 17 min: Ireland 14-0 Samoa Another clean Irish line-out just outside the Samoan 22. Bundee Aki is the first receiver as he crashes into a wall of blue. It's quickly recycled and Ireland move further right with real menace... Advertisement 17 min: Ireland 14-0 Samoa Good news for Samoa as Seilala Lam makes his way back onto the field. The Pacific Islanders back up to full strength. 16 min: Ireland 14-0 Samoa Samoa with the chance to pile on the pressure as they line up for a throw-in on the Irish 5-metre line. But it's more frustration. James Ryan makes the steal, those reaching arms of his plucking possession out of the sky. Ireland hold steady in front of their try line and boot the ball back into Samoa's half to turn the tables on their opponents. 13 min: Ireland 14-0 Samoa It's all one-way traffic as Ireland move into the 10th phase just inside their own half... but interception! Alapati Leiua gets his hand on the ball, having judged his run to perfection. It's not to be, though. He fumbles possession in the process. A close call for the Irish. 9 min: Ireland 14-0 Samoa (Furlong try, Sexton conversion) Ireland had their opponents on the ropes as they pushed them back deep inside their own 22. It was Tadhg Furlong who eventually landed the killer blow, bundling his way past at least three blue shirts with a Herculean display of strength before crashing over to the left of the posts.\n\nAdvertisement TRY! A second score for the Irish! 8 min: Ireland 7-0 Samoa Another Irish penalty finds touch down in the right-hand corner off Johnny Sexton's boot. They go for the rolling maul again following the line-out, making up six or seven metres before Conor Murray sends it left. The Irish with all the forward momentum here. 6 min: Ireland 7-0 Samoa And it's a yellow card. Lam goes to the bin! Stockdale had dropped into the challenge as he made contact, meaning the Samoan hooker's tackle caught the Irishman around the neck. Jack Lam protests, asking what else was his No 2 meant to do, but the referee is having none of it. Samoa down to 14. 6 min: Ireland 7-0 Samoa We've gone to TMO again for a high tackle by Seilala Lam on Jacob Stockdale. Advertisement 4 min: Ireland 7-0 Samoa (Best try, Sexton conversion) The man who started the move ends it as well. Having joined the back of the rolling maul after the throw, Rory Best guides the ship forward and over the white line as Samoa's defence capitulates. The referee briefly consulted with TMO to make sure it was clean, with questions over truck-and-trailing, but he's happy. Johnny Sexton with the extras. TRY! Rory Best dots down for Ireland! 3 min: Ireland 0-0 Samoa Johnny Sexton makes the most of advantage in Ireland's favour and hoists the ball up high. Samoa's back line holds firm under the pressure so back we go for the original penalty. Sexton sends it towards the bottom right-hand corner. Rory Best to make the throw-in. 1 min: Ireland 0-0 Samoa Ireland opt for the slow-ball approach off the restart but, after a couple of pushes forward, think otherwise. Conor Murray picks up from the base of the ruck and boots clear. On we go!
