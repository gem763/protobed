(AP) - If Alexander Johnson is indeed rusty, his Denver Broncos teammates can\u2019t wait to see how he\u2019ll play when he shakes that rust off.\n\nJohnson\u2019s first two NFL starts this month have produced 18 tackles, two pass breakups, two quarterback hits, 1\u00bd sacks, a tackle for loss and an end zone interception in back-to-back wins over the Chargers and Titans.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been killing it since he stepped in and I\u2019m happy for him,\u201d Broncos linebacker Von Miller said. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised, as he does all that stuff in practice. He\u2019s a great guy off the football field. We box in the offseason, we\u2019ve done so much stuff. He\u2019s been talking about it and meditating and waiting for his shot. It\u2019s definitely inspiring.\u201d\n\nStarting for the first time since his senior year at Tennessee in 2014 has allowed Johnson to display his pregame \u201cDinosaur \u201d jaunt through the tunnel.\n\nOn Sunday, he tweeted he was the \u201cfirst Dinosaur to come back from extinction in the football world.!!Thank you God\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of moving pieces in this defense and you can see him plucking away and learning and feeling more and more comfortable,\u201d safety Justin Simmons said. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s definitely an old-school SEC-looking linebacker.\u201d\n\nDenver coach Vic Fangio has tempered his applause for Johnson with admonitions to clean up assignment mistakes.\n\nFollowing Johnson\u2019s starting debut at Los Angeles two weeks ago, his first start since Nov. 15, 2014, for Tennessee against Kentucky, Fangio said the inside linebacker \u201cmade a bushel full of mistakes\u201d that he was lucky to get away with.\n\nHe cleaned most of those up Sunday in a 16-0 win over Tennessee.\n\n\u201cHe did, to a degree,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cStill had one or two. \u2026 But he played good.\u201d\n\nJohnson was a three-time All-SEC selection at Tennessee from 2011-14 and a four-year starter in Knoxville whose college career came to an end when a woman accused him and teammate Michael Williams of rape in November 2014. They were indicted in February 2015.\n\nForty-one months later, on July 27, 2018, both men were acquitted on all counts, and three months later Johnson signed with the Broncos.\n\nHe played just one game as a 26-year-old rookie and spent time on Denver\u2019s practice squad. This season, he played in three of the first four games but only on special teams.\n\nWith Josey Jewell bothered by a sore hamstring, Johnson got his chance to finally fulfill his childhood dream and start in the NFL, one he kept alive through his Christian faith and the inner peace he found in, of all places, mixed martial arts.\n\nA few lockers away from his, newly signed cornerback Coty Sensabaugh was lamenting last week about not being in training camp this summer because \u201cthere\u2019s just no simulating football games.\u201d\n\nSensabaugh had been away less than a year. So, how did Johnson overcome his long layoff from football?\n\n\u201cWell, I stayed in shape. Obviously, I worked a full-time job and I also was a personal trainer. I trained people and I trained myself and then I picked up doing MMA and that right there was probably one of the biggest things I could have done during the time I was off,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nJohnson said he knew very little about cage fighting until Knoxville-based UFC fighter Scott Holtzman invited him to the gym one day.\n\nSo, he went, \u201cand I\u2019m like, \u2018Yep, I think I found my second-favorite sport,\u2019\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a violent sport but you\u2019ve also got to think and be smart and be reactive. Within seven months of me starting, I was ready for my first fight,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough an injury scrubbed his octagon debut, Johnson continued MMA training because it was much more rigorous than anything he\u2019d ever done in football.\n\n\u201cIn football training, I can do a couple reps, rest, do a couple reps, rest. Whereas in fighting, you don\u2019t have any rest,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the cage, there\u2019s no catching your breath between rounds. There\u2019s no whistle every few seconds as there is in football.\n\n\u201cFighting is constant,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo, like in football you can have one bad play right here and correct yourself and you can accumulate another whole bunch of plays on top of that. But in fighting, you get caught wrong or miss a free punch or block the wrong way, you can be done. You can be knocked out.\u201d\n\nWhat he really came to love about the sport, though, was how it brought him such peace.\n\n\u201cAnything that happened that day or anything that\u2019s on your mind bothering you, you can\u2019t carry that into the gym because you\u2019ve got to clear your mind. You\u2019ve got to be focused on your craft while you\u2019re in the gym,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nHe said training has helped him become a better football player because he understands now how to make the most out of his strength and technique and not waste any energy.\n\n\u201cSimple things as when you punch somebody and your feet are off the ground or you\u2019re trying to lean, it\u2019s not going to be a powerful punch. But if I punch somebody and I\u2019m stepping, I\u2019m exerting energy from the ground and it\u2019s going to be more powerful,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nHe\u2019s using what he learned in MMA, he said, to help him minimize his mistakes on the football field and \u201ckeep stacking up some more good games.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "If Alexander Johnson is indeed rusty, his Denver Broncos teammates can't wait to see how he'll play when he shakes that rust off.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
