We suspect that even more people are involved. It is quite possible that the driver did not know what he was transporting.\"\n\nMr Robinson, of Laurel Drive, Craigavon in Northern Ireland, is due to appear via videolink at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering.\n\nThe bodies were discovered in a trailer compartment in the early hours of Wednesday at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, Essex.\n\nDetectives are now working on the largest mass fatality victim identification process in the force's history.\n\nPolice initially said the victims were Chinese, although a number of Vietnamese families have described how they fear their loved ones are among the dead.\n\nSome of the victims are said to have paid thousands of pounds to traffickers to guarantee their safe passage to the UK, from where they would be able to carry out work that would give them money to send home.\n\nDetectives are also investigating a \"wider conspiracy\" after claims surfaced that the lorry could have been part of a convoy of three carrying around 100 people.", "description": "The people smugglers who shipped 39 migrants into Britain only for them to die in the back of a lorry pretended the container was filled with cookies and biscuits, the Belgian federal prosecutor has claimed.", "authors": ["James Crisp", "Gareth Davies", "Brussels Correspondent", "Breaking News Editor", "Telegraph View", "Tim Stanley"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/28/TELEMMGLPICT000213888639-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1jEdJGp1DKo6SYFsq2yafzp8W5WDIrA6_OaM9DJ_huw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
