The latest moves come after dozens of US states launched privacy and antitrust investigations into Facebook and Google.\n\nAssociated Press contributed to this report", "description": "House judiciary committee wants records in antitrust inquiry, with Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook names in requests", "authors": ["Dominic Rushe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa8ce649acfbca3f81f5bdea813d3539e96964d6/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=918629e5b4791429a20cd3e7f58958a1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
