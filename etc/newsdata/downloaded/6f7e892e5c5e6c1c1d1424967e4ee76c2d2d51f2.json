Her release was blocked twice by former Gov. Jerry Brown, while the third was blocked by Gov. Gavin Newsom in June.\n\nTwo of the three appellate judges upheld Brown's decision to block Van Houten's release last year.\n\n\u201cThe Governor\u2019s determination that Van Houten has not taken full responsibility for her role in the crimes, and continues to pose a risk to the public, is supported by some evidence in the record,\u201d the judges ruled. They did not adopt Brown's other conclusion that her crimes alone provided enough reason to keep her in prison at age 70.\n\nCHARLES MANSON EX-LOVER CALLS HIM 'THE CLOSEST THING TO JESUS'\n\nThe third judge said \u201cthere is not a modicum of evidence\u201d to support a conclusion that Van Houten is still a danger.\n\nVan Houten's attorney, Rich Pfeiffer, said he would appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court. He argued his client has been rehabilitated and no longer poses a threat.\n\n\u201cI expected her to go home within a week or two, I really did,\" he said. \"And that\u2019s not happening. Two things you can bank on: She\u2019s gonna get out, and I\u2019m not giving up until she does.\u201d\n\nCHARLES MANSON FOLLOWER LYNETTE 'SQUEAKY' FROMME LIVING LIFE AS A 'VERY FRIENDLY' NEIGHBOR IN RURAL NEW YORK\n\nVan Houten was 19 when she and followers of Charles Manson fatally stabbed Los Angeles grocer Leo LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, in August 1969. The slayings were done at the direction of Manson and came a day after other Manson followers killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four others inside her home.\n\nVan Houten was not involved in the Tate killings.\n\nIn addition to Van Houten, former Manson followers Patricia Krenwinkel, 71; Bobby Beausoleil, 71; Charles \u201cTex\u201d Watson, 73; and Bruce Davis, 76; remain in prison, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPfeiffer has a separate appeal of Newsom's decision to deny Van Houten parole awaiting a lower court's consideration. He also plans to file a third lawsuit arguing corrections officials are required to recommend that Van Houten be resentenced because of her age at the time of the crime and her age now.\n\nManson died from natural causes in 2017 at a California hospital while serving a life sentence.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Charles Manson follower\u00a0Leslie Van Houten's\u00a0latest bid for freedom was denied by a California appeals court Friday.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19263789998194.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
