Ilhan Omar.\n\nAn overflow crowd of more than 20,000 supporters is expected to gather at the Target Center in Minneapolis, while protesters are vowing to descend on the arena in opposition.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be huge!\u201d tweeted Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale.\n\nIt will be the president\u2019s first appearance before a large crowd since House Democrats announced their impeachment inquiry over his alleged pressuring of Ukraine\u2019s president to launch an investigation of Democratic candidate Joseph R. Biden. The president has denied wrongdoing and is refusing to comply with Democrats\u2019 demand for documents and testimony from administration officials.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo has promised a \u201chighly visible and robust police presence\u201d downtown for the rally. The event is going forward after the city\u2019s Democratic mayor, Jacob Frey, demanded the Trump campaign pay more than $500,000 in expenses, and the campaign responded with a threat to sue.\n\nThe president lost Minnesota in 2016 to Democratic Hillary Clinton by 1.5 percentage points, and his campaign is devoting considerably more effort to win the state next year. Thursday\u2019s rally will be Mr. Trump\u2019s fourth visit to the state.\n\nMinneapolis, in addition to being the home district of the Somali-born Ms. Omar, is a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants. The president and Ms. Omar have feuded repeatedly this year, with Mr. Trump branding her and other far-left freshman lawmakers as the new face of the Democratic Party.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
