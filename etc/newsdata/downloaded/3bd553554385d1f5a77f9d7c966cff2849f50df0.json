REUTERS/David W Cerny/Illustration/File Photo\n\nThe Czech crown EURCZK=, Polish zloty EURPLN= and Hungarian forint EURHUF= have struggled to reverse losses suffered in the last two months as they come under pressure from U.S.-China trade tensions and Britain\u2019s uncertain exit from the European Union.\n\nFriday\u2019s poll showed the forint, which hit a record low of 336.28 to the euro last week, should regain some ground before the end of the year and firm the most over the next 12 months.\n\nThe zloty and crown will likely tread water in the last quarter of 2019 before returning to gradual gains in 2020.\n\nRadomir Jac, chief economist for Generali Investments CEE, said local worries, such as relaxed monetary policy in Hungary and uncertainty over past foreign currency loans in Poland, have added to global risks.\n\n\u201cAs some of these factors should be clarified in the coming weeks and months, I would expect regional currencies to recover,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDomestic fundamentals are supportive, certainly in the case of the Czech crown and Polish zloty, and I think that also the Hungarian forint has room to recover a bit from record lows.\u201d\n\nThe median forecast in the poll saw Hungary\u2019s forint climbing to 328.25 to the euro in the next year, up 1.5% from Thursday midday trade. In a September poll, analysts had forecast a rise to 317 in 12 months.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Hungarian forint - here)\n\nThe forint has lost close to 4% so far in 2019, more than double the declines of the zloty or Romanian leu EURRON=.\n\nAmid global worries, Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector - a key trade link for the central European region - is already battling recession. But central Europe has been resilient so far, with second-quarter growth between 2.0% and 4.9% thanks to domestic demand.\n\nInflation remains high and central banks in the region are in wait-and-see mode even while the European Central Bank and U.S. Federal Reserve loosen their policy.\n\nBut currencies have yet to benefit from interest rate differentials.\n\nIn the case of the crown, which the poll forecast to rise by 1.0% to 25.50 to the euro in a year\u2019s time, the Czech central bank (CNB) delivered its eighth rate hike in two years in May and continues to debate tightening.\n\nCommerzbank said despite short-term global worries, it expected the crown \u201cto appreciate moderately against the euro over the forecast horizon, not least due to the solid domestic economy and the more restrictive CNB relative to other central banks.\u201d\n\n(GRAPHIC: Czech crown - here)\n\nThe poll was conducted before a European Court of Justice ruling on Thursday that favored Polish consumers who took out mortgages in Swiss francs, allowing them to ask Polish courts to convert their loans into the local currency.\n\nING\u2019s EMEA FX and IR strategist Petr Krpata said the ruling could have a \u201cslow burning effect on the zloty as the court cases may take years to resolve.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe zloty is forecast to gain 0.9% to 4.30 to the euro over the next 12 months.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Polish zloty - here)", "description": "Central Europe's leading currencies should firm against the euro over the next year, lifted by solid growth once global worries calm, although the expected gains will be less than previously forecast, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.", "authors": ["Jason Hovet", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436952746&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930LK", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
