It is the benchmark set for NATO members but the security situation confronting western Europe is vastly different, giving the main potential adversary, Russia, has a much smaller economy than the rest of Europe combined and NATO operates under the principle of collective defence \u2013 an attack on one nation is an attack on all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lone common element is that the US underpins security arrangements.\n\nTwo per cent gained currency in Australia only as a way for the Coalition to attack the Gillard government for letting defence spending slide when budget revenue got wiped out by the global financial crisis \u2013 remember that it was almost treasonous how Labor had allowed it to fall to the lowest level since 1938, the year before World War II broke out?\n\nBut asked whether the Morrison government would hold defence spending at 2 per cent or set a new, higher target, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds deflected questions to one of her department's army of spin doctors, who issued a suitably vague statement.\n\nThe statement said only spending in the first budget year was formally appropriated but the Defence Department's funding plan (outlined in the 2016 white paper) had been deliberately constructed to provide money to the military when required to meet its capability needs.\n\nIn other words, Defence has a road map for the funding it says it needs until the mid-2020s but it is not baked into legislation.\n\nThat does give the government some flexibility to pare back defence spending if the budget situation deteriorates.\n\nBut it is much more likely the government will go well beyond 2 per cent, because of a range of factors, such as the shiny new toys entering service or those that are on order.\n\nWhile there is a good understanding of the acquisition costs \u2013 such as $50 billion for submarines \u2013 these new assets will also drive structural increases in defence spending.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, a doubling in the submarine fleet will mean doubling crew numbers.\n\nFurthermore, the sophisticated hardware is increasingly expensive to operate. According to ASPI's budget brief, the cost of a flying hour for a new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is $41,800, double that of the classic F/A-18 Hornet, which is being retired.\n\nThe army's Vietnam War-era M113 armoured personnel carriers were like tractors that needed little more than a diesel mechanic to keep them running, one defence industry source told this column. But their eventual replacement will contain a host of computer systems that need to be maintained.\n\nA frequent criticism of the 2016 white paper and its associated integrated investment plan is it leans towards manned platforms at the expense of drone technology, which is cheaper to operate over the long term.\n\nThe strategic underpinnings in the 2016 white paper are also starting to show their age. It failed to anticipate the alliance disruption the election of Donald Trump has caused, while China's resolve has only hardened.\n\nCongested and contested\n\nAs one senior commander put it recently, the waters where Australia operates are becoming \"more congested and more contested\".\n\nThat has necessitated an uptick in operations. While the government boasts about the the Pacific Step-up, which includes a hefty military component, no extra money was allocated for this venture, forcing Defence to juggle its budget and redeploy resources from elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf every time Beijing shows interest in establishing a base somewhere in the Pacific, Australia's response is to swoop in over the top with an offer of greater military assistance, it is going to become an expensive exercise.\n\nReynolds is tight-lipped on whether the government will soon commission a fresh white paper (previous versions have been released between three and seven years apart) but the Defence Department told AFR Weekend it is conducting a \"fundamental review of our planning against changes in the strategic environment, technology and threats over the 2020 to 2040 timeframe\".\n\nBureaucrats plan to present the review to government next year but it is not clear how much, if any of it, will be made public.\n\nOne thing seems obvious: the government has to start conditioning Australians that the military will soak up more taxpayer dollars.\n\nJust don't expect a parade to see what it is being spent on.", "description": "Australia was once an underspender on defence.
