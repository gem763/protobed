The three are reportedly operated by a restaurant company founded by a tycoon whose daughter has denounced the protesters.\n\nThe protesters have been rallying since June for full democracy and police accountability. But the rallies have ended in increasing violence as protesters throwing firebombs are met by police with tear gas, pepper spray and water cannons.\n\nProtesters set fire to Chinese bank branches and Chinese smartphone brand Xiaomi's boutique on Sunday after an unauthorized rally by tens of thousands of people.\n\nA welder put the finishing touches on grey steel panels covering up an Industrial and Commercial Bank of China branch in the city's Wan Chai district.\n\nAcross the street, a state-owned China Travel Service outlet was getting the same treatment.\n\nSigns at a nearby China Construction Bank branch said \"enhancement work was in progress\" but it was business as usual and apologized for the inconvenience.\n\nStaff at the businesses refused to comment.\n\nA passing pro-democracy supporter, restaurant manager Tim Lo, said it wouldn't solve the root cause of the conflict.\n\n\"Barricading is useless,\" he said.", "description": "As Hong Kong's protest movement becomes increasingly violent, some shops are battening the hatches.
