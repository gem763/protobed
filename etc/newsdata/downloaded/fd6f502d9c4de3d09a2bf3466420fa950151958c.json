In the coming week, House investigators are scheduled to hear testimony from five more witnesses, including on Saturday from a Foreign Service officer stationed in Kyiv, who is expected to testify about the efforts to oust the previous U.S. ambassador.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a sign of the growing realization of his potential jeopardy, Trump has brought back Jane and Marty Raskin, criminal defense attorneys who were part of his legal team during the Mueller investigation, to help him navigate the impeachment investigation, along with his attorney Jay Sekulow and White House lawyers. Their return is a late acknowledgment, some White House advisers say, that the facts coming out are bad for the president, and both his White House and personal attorneys need to try to get in front of what else may emerge.\n\nThe president\u2019s reconstituted legal team is racing to master details about the administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, along with the efforts of their longtime co-counsel, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to push Ukraine officials to investigate Trump\u2019s foes.\n\nMeanwhile, White House officials have begun holding regular impeachment strategy meetings, often in the Situation Room. Some advisers are discussing bringing in a veteran lawyer with impeachment experience, and actively seeking a communications strategist, according to advisers and officials.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment. Sekulow and the Raskins declined to comment.\n\nThe belated scramble \u2014 a month after the House formally launched its impeachment inquiry \u2014 serves as a recognition that the White House\u2019s strategy of refusing to cooperate with the probe has failed to stymie it, according to multiple Trump advisers and people involved in responding to House requests.\n\nThat posture was driven by Trump, who dictated much of a defiant letter sent by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone to House leaders earlier this month that claimed the inquiry was constitutionally invalid, according to people familiar with his role.\n\nAD\n\nAlthough Democrats have not yet been able to secure the participation of all the witnesses they have sought, nine key figures have testified so far, including two current ambassadors and a Pentagon official.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s largely because attorneys for officials who have been called for depositions concluded that the White House\u2019s legal arguments are weak compared with a congressional subpoena, according to people familiar with the conversations.\n\nWhile senior White House advisers have a reason to claim they legally can ignore a congressional subpoena because of executive privilege concerns, that is not the case with career employees, legal experts said.\n\nAD\n\nAs a result, civil servants within the bureaucracy that Trump decries as the Deep State are giving Congress a series of damaging accounts about the extent of the effort to pressure Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThese are civil servants who realize their duty is public service and honoring the Constitution . . . and [some] are deeply disturbed by the horrendous abuses they have witnessed,\u201d said Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability, a nonprofit organization that promotes transparency in government and campaigns.\n\nAD\n\nA number of outside advisers are perplexed that the White House hasn\u2019t filed an injunction or taken some other legal step to stop the parade of officials sharing what they saw and heard.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMany Trump allies are concerned and don\u2019t understand the strategy of not filing an injunction,\u201d said Jason Miller, an informal Trump adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s a head-scratcher. President Trump and the administration have clearly said they don\u2019t want folks participating in this sham process and stepping all over presidential privilege.\u201d\n\nThe success the Democrats have had in securing powerful witness testimony is a stark contrast with their efforts earlier in the year, when they sought to interview former White House advisers about Trump\u2019s efforts to block the Russia investigation.\n\nAt the time, the White House invoked the risks to executive privilege \u2014 directing witnesses such as former White House counsel Donald McGahn and former communications director Hope Hicks that they could not share their accounts with Congress without jeopardizing confidential conversations they had with the president.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe assertion wasn\u2019t settled law, but it worked: Despite a subpoena, McGahn declined to testify and Hicks agreed to appear in a closed-door session accompanied by White House lawyers, but then declined to answer any questions about her time in the White House.\n\nIn the impeachment inquiry, the administration has sought to use that same playbook, warning witnesses that they should not participate, according to White House talking points and letters sent by top agency officials to their employees.\n\nCipollone\u2019s main argument: The House impeachment inquiry was not legally \u201cauthorized\u201d by a House vote, and so the administration was not required to participate.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYour inquiry is constitutionally invalid and a violation of due process,\u201d he wrote in his Oct. 8 letter to House leaders. \u201cFor the foregoing reasons, the President cannot allow your constitutionally illegitimate proceedings to distract him and those in the Executive Branch from their work on behalf of the American people.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHowever, the House can make its own rules and can conduct investigations under its own terms, legal experts said. On Friday, Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of Washington dismissed arguments by Republicans that the House must first vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry, calling the notion politically \u201cappealing\u201d but legally \u201cfatally flawed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo governing law requires this test \u2014 not the Constitution, not House Rules, and not [the grand jury secrecy rule], and so imposing this test would be an impermissible intrusion on the House\u2019s constitutional authority,\u201d Howell wrote.\n\nAD\n\nWhite House lawyers also have argued that witnesses should not testify unless an administration lawyer is present \u2014 an argument the White House made in talking points distributed to Republicans when ousted ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was facing requests from the House.\n\nAD\n\nWithout a government lawyer by her side, the White House claimed, \u201cthere is serious danger that she could breach her obligations as a current employee not to reveal such information without authorization.\u201d\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee responded with a subpoena, saying \u201cthe illegitimate order from the Trump Administration not to cooperate has no force.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch complied, and laid out in her testimony details about her abrupt ouster from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cToday, we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from within,\u201d she said in prepared remarks obtained by The Washington Post, warning that U.S. adversaries such as Russia stand to benefit \u201cwhen bad actors in countries beyond Ukraine see how easy it is to use fiction and innuendo to manipulate our system.\u201d\n\nA similar effort to prevent this week\u2019s testimony of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper also failed. In a letter to her attorney, the Pentagon urged her not to participate in the inquiry, according to a copy obtained by The Post.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis letter informs you and Ms. Cooper of the Administration-wide direction that Executive Branch personnel \u2018cannot participate in [the impeachment] inquiry under these circumstances,\u2019 \u201d Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist wrote. \u201cIn the event that the Committees issue a subpoena to compel Ms. Cooper\u2019s appearance, you should be aware that the Supreme Court has held . . . that a person cannot be sanctioned for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena unauthorized by House Rule or Resolution.\u201d\n\nShe nevertheless showed up to give testimony. Her interview was delayed for hours when GOP lawmakers barged into the deposition room, a tactic encouraged by Trump, according to people familiar with his role.\n\nAs the inquiry has plowed forward, Trump has expressed anger at the number of people who are testifying, asking why they can\u2019t be stopped, according to advisers.\n\nWhite House officials are discussing the need to bring in another high-level attorney, someone with the skills of former White House attorney Emmet Flood, who worked on President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment team.\n\nEarlier in the month, White House officials had said that former congressman Trey Gowdy was coming aboard to assist the legal team, but later said he was unable to begin until January because of federal lobbying rules.\n\nMeanwhile, the president has ramped up calls to lawmakers in recent days, trying to make his case individually to every Republican senator, according to a senior administration official.\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who met with Trump at White House on Thursday for lunch, said the president was defiant. \u201cHe just kept saying he did nothing wrong, he did nothing wrong,\u201d Graham said in an interview. \u201cHe said it over and over.\u201d\n\nGraham said he wanted to see a more aggressive legal and communications team: \u201cI was on the receiving end on the Clinton team. They were good. They knew what they were doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope we can get a more coordinated message,\u201d Graham added. \u201cThey are working on it.\u201d", "description": "The president is angry that his efforts to stop people from cooperating with the probe have so far collapsed in the face of congressional subpoenas, according to multiple aides and advisers.", "authors": ["Carol D.
