At his trial, Bracamontes laughed as he told the judge about his desire to kill even more cops, and his promise to kill again in the future. Bracamontes was sentenced to death, but California's last execution was back in 2006. Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive moratorium on the state's death penalty in March of this year.\n\nPresident Trump used footage from the Bracamontes trial in a campaign ad attacking Democrats for their dangerous immigration policies. Following the slaying of the two deputies in 2014, California passed a statewide sanctuary-city policy, shielding criminal aliens from federal immigration authorities.\n\nIt is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country. Vote Republican now! https://t.co/0pWiwCHGbh pic.twitter.com/2crea9HF7G \u2014 Donald J.
