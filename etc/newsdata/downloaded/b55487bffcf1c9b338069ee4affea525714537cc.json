I can\u2019t take much more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m losing the will to live and have no dignity. Lately I\u2019ve been feeling like I just don\u2019t want to be here anymore.\u201d\n\nWidow Betty was Lynn\u2019s full-time carer until her own health deteriorated in 2017 and help was provided.\n\n(Image: Feelance)\n\nBut Lynn says the care commission require her to get ready in her room, which is too cramped for carers to work in and use the equipment needed.\n\nShe asked the council to extend the property and says it was suggested she should instead move to another area, but she doesn\u2019t want to leave the network of family and friends she has nearby.\n\nAfter trying to crowdfund the cash herself, Lynn\u2019s wish for adaptations to the two-bed property was granted in March.\n\nBut seven months on, she is still waiting for work to start on the downstairs bedroom and open-plan living space she desperately needs.\n\nBetty said: \u201cWhen they said they would help we were delighted but not one thing has changed, apart from our health.\n\n(Image: Feelance)\n\n\u201cThere has just been delay after delay and now Lynn has to go into respite for as long as it takes - which takes away her independence. We just can\u2019t live like this any more.\u201d\n\nSouth Lanarkshire Council said: \u201cWe assisted the owner occupier in establishing what physical alterations could technically be made to the property to support the family\u2019s medical needs.\n\nThereafter, Care and Repair, an independent charity that provides assistance in such circumstances, have been working closely with the owner to access grant assistance.\n\n\u201cThe process of securing architects, building warrants and contractors to undertake the agreed works is ongoing and the owner has been kept updated at each stage.\n\n\u201cCare and Repair have confirmed that, as required for grant assistance, three contractors have now tendered for this work.\n\n\u201cThe tenders are due back on November 1, 2019 and thereafter a contractor will be appointed to build the extension.\n\n\u201cWe will ensure the successful contractor is aware of the urgency of this situation and ask that they undertake these works as soon as possible.\u201d", "description": "Lynn Callan, from South Lanarkshire in Scotland, has spina bifida and says she is \"losing the will to live\" after shocking delays to improvements to her home", "authors": ["Sally Hind", "Image", "Hamilton Advertiser", "Daily Record - Tony Nicoletti", "Facebook", "Feelance"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20663347.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_dmp_ham_280119callan_01JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
