A Seattle homeless man named Rene Maya Estrada, who is apparently also an illegal immigrant, has been arrested and charged with raping a teenager at knifepoint. However, in this case, the rape didn\u2019t happen on the street it happened in the girl\u2019s own home. Why was Estrada in the girl\u2019s home? Because her parents had invited him to live there temporarily:\n\nConsidered an extreme flight risk, prosecutors say he has been in Washington for eight months, appears to have been subject to immigration-removal proceedings in 2005, and had his Mexican passport with him at the time of his arrest. It also appears a warrant was issued for his arrest in Colorado on drug charges, according to the records. \u201cThe defendant is essentially a stranger to the victim. He was homeless and her parents allowed him to stay in their apartment in order to help him get on his feet,\u201d Senior Deputy Prosecutor Celia Lee wrote in charging papers\u2026 Two days later, \u201cthe defendant waited for the victim to arrive home from work, grabbed her and forced her into her bedroom at knifepoint, where he removed her clothing and raped her. He told her he would kill her if she did not comply with his demands,\u201d Lee wrote. \u201cWhen she resisted, he punched her. He then moved her, at knifepoint, to the laundry room, where he raped her again.\u201d\n\nThe 17-year-old victim finally escaped because of some quick thinking. A car pulled up outside the laundry room and she claimed the people inside, who were strangers, were her cousins. She raced to the car and got in and Estrada left. Once he was gone she told the real story to a woman in the parking lot who called 911.\n\nPolice responded but were unable to arrest Estrada. Four days later he showed up at the teen\u2019s place of work saying he felt bad. She called 911 and this time the police got him.\n\nICE is reportedly investigating Rene Estrada but, as of today, hasn\u2019t said whether or not he has been deported in the past.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a homeless person has been accused of rape this year in Seattle. Three months ago a 60-year-old homeless man was accused of raping two teens, aged 13 and 14, after providing them with drugs. And last year a 24-year-old homeless man was accused of raping a 40-year-old woman in the bathroom of a car dealership. That woman, identified only as Lindsey, later approached documentary filmmaker Christopher Rufo to tell her story. After they released a video describing her rape, Lindsey said she faced a backlash from progressives in Seattle who didn\u2019t like that her story was making homeless people look bad:\n\nProgressive activists launched a counterattack against Lindsey on social media. Local journalist Erica Barnett claimed that the story drew attention because Lindsey is an \u201cattractive blonde woman\u201d and dismissed the victim\u2019s \u201cmany tears\u201d as theatrics serving a false narrative that the homeless represent a danger to the community. She demanded that the media temper its reporting and be mindful that \u201cgraphic descriptions of violent rape may be triggering for survivors.\u201d Barnett\u2019s message was amplified on left-wing Twitter; Councilwoman Lorena Gonzalez claimed that Lindsey\u2019s story would create fear and cause harm to communities \u201cthat may already be triggered.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s definitely a contingent of Seattle progressives who don\u2019t want to hear any bad news about the homeless, not even from victims of rape.\n\nAs for Estrada, it\u2019s hard to imagine how someone could become such a POS that they would rape the daughter of people who offered him a free place to live just two days after he arrived. Then again, it\u2019s also hard to imagine being a parent dumb enough to let someone like this into your home. If a company had let a homeless man move into its offices and someone was raped, the company would surely be sued. It\u2019s a shame this girl can\u2019t benefit by suing her own parents.", "description": "\"He told her he would kill her if she did not comply...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Seattle.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
