Bnbguard, an agency that helps strata schemes target unapproved holiday lets, has identified 110 operators in NSW who each have more than 30 properties listed on Airbnb. One host alone has listed 420 properties online.\n\nAirbnb has made clear its objections to the holiday let register proposed for NSW.\n\n\u201cA proposed register will flush out a lot of people who have sublet apartments and houses without the owners\u2019 permission, or who are operating in defiance of their strata scheme\u2019s bylaws,\" said BnbGuard founder Reuben Schwarz.\n\nHoliday let seminars have also set alarm bells ringing at the Tenants Union. \u201cThis is the kind of behaviour that we are very concerned about,\u201d says NSW advocacy officer Leo Patterson Ross.\n\n\u201cOne of the seminars [not BnbProfessionals] was promoting the idea that you could get around the proposed 180-day limit on holiday lets in NSW by switching platforms.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NSW legislation, which is awaiting the formulation of the register and code of conduct, will include a 180 night limit for whole-home rentals (when the host is not present), for greater Sydney and rural councils, such as around Byron Bay, that choose to implement it.\n\nRegister opposed by Airbnb\n\nThere is no restriction on the number of nights allowed for whole home lets in any other Australian state.\n\nThis week a parliamentary report issued in WA recommended introducing a register of short-term rentals, new fire safety measures and the ability for strata schemes to pass by-laws to allow or restrict holiday rentals, among other measures.\n\nMeanwhile, ordinary tenants aren\u2019t blameless when it comes to holiday lets. Stories abound of individual renters \u201ccouch surfing\u201d with friends when paying guests sign up, with the property owner having no idea that the flat had been listed online.\n\nMeanwhile, Airbnb has made clear its objections to the holiday let register proposed for NSW. \u201cThere is a genuine risk of compulsory registration being complex, costly and time-consuming which will make it harder than it needs to be for people to share their space or home,\" public affairs manager Julian Crowley said recently.\n\nIts largest rival, Stayz, disagrees. \u201cWhen implemented correctly in other parts of the world, the registration of holiday rentals has proven to be a low-cost and effective way of informing the development of sensible rules for our growing sector,\u201d Stayz corporate affairs director Eacham Curry said.", "description": "The prospect of six-figure earnings is being used to lure some tenants into subletting properties on Airbnb, sometimes without the knowledge of the owner.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3673%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_345%2C$y_127/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6b3d5518202c547d124baca5a4e88c5895c01ec9", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
