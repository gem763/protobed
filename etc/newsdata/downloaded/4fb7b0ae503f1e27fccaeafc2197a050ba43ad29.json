The agreement gives the Kurds some time to give up their weapons and leave the region that Turkey has been trying to capture. It will allow Turkish forces to take over northern Syria.\n\nThe deal worked \u201cwithout spilling a drop of American blood,\u201d Trump told supporters at the rally.\n\nThe withdrawal decision led to Turkey attacking the Kurdish-held region with at least 180 airstrikes as of Thursday morning, killing at least 16 fighters, four civilians (including an infant), and injuring at least 70 more in border towns, according to The New York Times. Hundreds of thousands of Kurds have fled northeastern Syria since Trump\u2019s announcement to withdraw the U.S. troops.\n\nPOTUS: \"Sometimes you have to let them fight, like two kids in a yard.\"\n\n(people died) \u2014 kendis (@kendisgibson) October 18, 2019\n\nThe deal, which Turkey\u2019s foreign minister clarified as a \u201cpause\u201d and not a ceasefire, creates a five-day halt in Turkey\u2019s attack against the Kurds, whom the country considers terrorists. The deal came after Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Turkey to prevent an escalation of the violence that Trump had effectively greenlighted.\n\n\u201cDuring a five-day period, we\u2019re going to see if we can get it all finalized, and I think it will be,\u201d Trump said Thursday evening. \u201cSo Turkey\u2019s going to be happy, the Kurds are going to be happy, ISIS is going to be unhappy.\u201d\n\nTrump sympathized with Turkey at the campaign rally, calling the country\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan a \u201cgentleman\u201d and saying that Turkey \u201cwas having a lot of bad things happen from this region, in all fairness.\u201d\n\nThe president has faced overwhelming backlash by both Democrats and Republicans for his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the Kurdish-held region, basically allowing Turkish forces to invade while leaving the Kurds vulnerable. Many said the decision would likely lead to a resurgence of ISIS, made more likely after hundreds of ISIS supporters escaped detention in northern Syria as a result of Trump\u2019s move.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump made a series of comments undermining the U.S. alliance with the Kurds, saying the fighters were \u201cnot angels\u201d and the Turkish invasion \u201cnot our problem.\u201d\n\nThe Senate on Thursday introduced sanctions on Turkey, a more detailed and punitive measure than the sanctions Trump imposed earlier this week. The House voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to condemn Trump\u2019s recent foreign policy decision in the Middle East.\n\nPres. Trump suffered \u2018a serious meltdown' that forced an abrupt conclusion to a bipartisan Oval Office meeting on Syria, according to top Dems.\n\n\n\nSpeaker Pelosi later described Trump's fit as so extreme that she fears for his health pic.twitter.com/p0FIErvtg1 \u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) October 18, 2019\n\nTrump has continued to defend his decision, saying this week that it was \u201cstrategically brilliant.\u201d On Wednesday, after the House vote, the president berated House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a meeting meant to be about Trump\u2019s plan of action on Syria.\n\nSome supporters at the rally thought Trump made the right move in pulling the U.S. troops from the region, citing the need for the country to stay out of wars.\n\n\u201cWe need to get out of there. We\u2019ve been having wars for no reason for pretty much my entire life,\u201d 40-year-old Josh Warren of Garland, Texas, told HuffPost. \u201c[President George W.] Bush put us in those wars. They were wars to fill his pockets. Bush wasn\u2019t really for this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he needs to bring our American troops home,\u201d said Debbie Bewley. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to be involved in useless wars.\u201d", "description": "At his campaign rally in Dallas, the president brought up Turkey's agreement to temporarily pause its attacks on Kurdish-held northern Syria.", "authors": ["Reporter", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da91a1f2000000912506083.jpeg?cache=8kusuz3t1b&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
