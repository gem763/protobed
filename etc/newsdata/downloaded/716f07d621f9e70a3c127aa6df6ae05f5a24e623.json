Drug companies argue a drug\u2019s list price \u2014 which doesn't reflect the discounts negotiated with insurers or through patient assistance programs \u2014 is often higher than what the patient actually pays.\n\nHowever, the ICER report focused on total U.S. drug spending rather than per-unit costs.\n\nPresident Trump Donald John TrumpTrump campaign slams Minneapolis mayor, Target Center for 'attempting to extort' them with rally security fees Susan Rice calls Trump decision to pull troops from Syria 'batshit crazy' Ex-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report MORE has made lowering drug prices a top priority of his presidency, and there are currently two competing drug pricing plans in Congress: a bipartisan Senate plan and a more sweeping plan from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiEx-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown Former George W.
