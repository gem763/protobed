A private letter offers clues \u01c0 View", "language": "en", "text": "When Prince Harry released a statement Tuesday announcing that he and his wife, Meghan, were suing the Mail on Sunday over the publication of a private letter the Duchess of Sussex had sent to her estranged father, the British press was divided. While some journalistic quarters have accused the prince of being \u201csanctimonious\u201d and \u201cplaying the victim card,\u201d others have defended the right of the Sussexes to protect their privacy.\n\nBut whatever you think of the lawsuit, it\u2019s clear that public opinion has never really been on Meghan\u2019s side. Indeed, ever since Harry and Meghan announced their engagement in November 2017, the American actress-turned-duchess has faced a constant barrage of criticism in the British press and from much of the British public. There have been stories about feuds with Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, reports of diva-like behavior in the run-up to her wedding, accusations of hypocrisy and profligacy. But it is the estrangement from her father, Thomas Markle, which has attracted much press attention, and which has been the cause of substantial criticism toward her.\n\nCulturally in the United Kingdom, the \u201cfamily is family\u201d refrain still has incredible potency. No matter how toxic the relationship, or how damaged the parent, plenty of people still believe that you should stick by your relatives whatever the cost to your personal well-being. In a 2015 survey out of the University of Cambridge, 68 percent of U.K. respondents said there was social stigma around family estrangement, and that they had felt judged for contradicting societal expectations after cutting off contact with a family member.\n\nFor most of us, these painful estrangements at least have the benefit of taking place in private. Not so for Meghan. Hannah Beckerman British author, journalist and broadcaster\n\nMeghan\u2019s acrimonious relationship with her dad \u2014 as well as with other members of her wider family \u2014 is a public rift many British people find distasteful, as the commentary in many newspaper articles attests, not to mention social media. It is an affront to so-called traditional family values, and neglects the Biblical commandment to \u201chonor thy father and thy mother;\u201d indeed, in today\u2019s Daily Mail, Piers Morgan accuses Meghan and Harry of being \u201cheartless\u201d in the way they\u2019ve \u201cbanished\u201d Thomas Markle from their lives. Whatever the private context for the rift between Meghan and her father \u2014 and none of us know what that context is \u2014 it is invariably Meghan who bears the brunt of the blame.\n\nThis specific criticism hits a very personal nerve with me. When I became estranged from my father 25 years ago, I was the recipient of similar judgmental attitudes. You only have one father, people used to tell me, as though perhaps I might have forgotten. It was, in fact, a truth of which I was painfully aware: I only had one father, and mine \u2014 an aggressive alcoholic \u2014 hadn\u2019t lived up to the task.\n\nAs anyone who has ever become estranged from a family member knows \u2014 and there are, statistically, plenty of us out there \u2014 the decision is never taken lightly. To become estranged from a family member is like a slow, gradual death. It rarely happens overnight. It\u2019s very rarely the result of a single incident. More often, it\u2019s a buildup over time \u2014 often years \u2014 of toxic behavior, until self-preservation demands you distance yourself from it.\n\nFor years, I thought I was unusual in having such a significant estrangement in my life. But when I started writing and researching a novel about family estrangement \u2014 in which a mother is desperate to reunite her two adult daughters after three decades of a seemingly inexplicable rift \u2014 I learned I wasn\u2019t alone.Research from a U.K. charity suggested that 19 percent of British adults are in families containing one or more estrangements. Across the pond, one U.S. study found that 40 percent of participants had experienced family estrangement, while another discovered that 10 percent of American mothers are currently estranged from at least one adult child. And when my novel, \u201cIf Only I Could Tell You,\u201d published in the U.K. earlier this year, I received hundreds of messages from readers telling me they\u2019d always felt ashamed and isolated by their own broken families.\n\nFor most of us, these painful estrangements at least have the benefit of taking place in private. Not so for Meghan. For the past two years, she\u2019s had her family conflicts displayed across the front pages of newspapers, discussed on TV shows and debated in magazines, all by people who don\u2019t actually know anything about her situation. For anyone who\u2019s encountered dysfunctional family dynamics, to have remained silent as Meghan has \u2014 to have resisted the temptation to tell her side of the story while others are selling theirs \u2014 displays incredible self-restraint and remarkable dignity.\n\nThere are, of course, other insidious forces at play regarding the criticism Meghan has faced. There\u2019s an undertone of racism to some of the reporting, fueled by right-wing pockets of U.K. society that resent a mixed-raced woman marrying into the royal family. Xenophobia has played a part too: the British do not, after all, have a great track record when it comes to welcoming Americans into our royalty.\n\nAnd there\u2019s undoubtedly a strong element of misogyny as well: The fact that Meghan has strong opinions \u2014 and is not afraid to express them \u2014 is unpalatable for some sections of the British establishment. You only have to look at the treatment of many female members of Parliament \u2014 ranging from gross condescension to threats of violence \u2014 to know that in some areas of British life, strong, opinionated women are still deemed unacceptable. But it is her ongoing familial struggles which have proved click-bait for so many readers, and which of course is now the subject of such a high-profile legal battle.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve learned to be robust in the face of others\u2019 criticisms about my own estrangement, but I haven\u2019t had to watch it dissected by the world\u2019s media. Whether or not Meghan Markle wins her legal battle \u2014 and the right to protect her privacy around such difficult relationships \u2014 remains to be seen. But perhaps, in the meantime, the rest of us could offer a little less judgment and a lot more compassion.\n\nHannah Beckerman is a British author, journalist and broadcaster.
