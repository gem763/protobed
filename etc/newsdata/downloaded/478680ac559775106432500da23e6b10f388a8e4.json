Looking ahead to November, several stocks could extend the positive momentum, if history is any indicator, including travel concern Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK). On the flip side, red-hot real estate investment trust (REIT) stock Duke Realty Corp (NYSE:DRE) could be facing seasonal headwinds ahead of earnings.\n\nALK Stock Flies High in November\n\nBelow are the 25 best SPX stocks to own in November, looking back 10 years. Alaska Air stock easily tops the list, ending the month higher 100% of the time, and averaging a one-month gain of 10%, per data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White.\n\nbest stocks november More\n\nALK shares have been on fire since skimming the $57 in late August, and marked a year-to-date high of $72 last Friday, Oct. 25, following well-received earnings and guidance. What's more, the stock has surged more than 30% since touching a four-year low of $53.39 in late March, breaking out to the upside recently after an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. From the security's current perch of $69.61, another 10% surge next month would put it around $76.57 -- north of its late 2018 highs.\n\nALK stock chart oct 29 More\n\nA continued short squeeze could help keep the wind at ALK's back. Short interest has been dropping recently, but still accounts for nearly a week's worth of pent-up buying demand, at the airline stock's average pace of trading.\n\nPlus, in light of the equity's post-earnings volatility crush, near-term options are attractively priced. The stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 24% sits in just the 11th percentile of its annual range, meaning now is an opportune time to speculate on ALK's short-term trajectory with options.\n\nDuke Realty Stock Could Slip After Earnings\n\nDuke Realty tops the list of the worst stocks to own in November, looking back 10 years at current S&P 500 components. The equity has ended the month higher just 20% of the time -- the worst of the group -- and has averaged a loss of roughly 3.2%.\n\nworst november stocks More\n\nStory continues", "description": "The best and worst stocks, historically, also sport attractively priced options", "authors": ["Andrea Kramer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.6t2YXoMR_pN8JjOgOBqpQ--~B/aD02MTM7dz01NTE7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/schaeffers_investment_research_24/b0bbb8a3400a35180f6bd7d68ee528fc", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
