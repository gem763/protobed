But the other source of resistance was the health of the banking sector itself.\n\n\"The problem is the business of being a bank is getting deposits in, that's normally what most banking businesses are about.\n\n\"When rates go to zero, banks still have to maintain their cost bases and extensive branch networks.\n\n\"You start driving the cost of lending down but their cost of money is not going down, and it is the fear of this that has resulted in the European banks trading at half book value and below,\" he said.\n\nBank of Ireland and Intesa Sanpaolo were terrific banks which dominate their markets, but are experiencing \"appalling\" returns on equity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What I can tell you in the case of Intesa is in the worst possible business conditions they're paying you a dividend of 10 per cent. So all we need there is a little flip, interest rates, a little bit of credit growth [and the stock would re-rate],\" the fund manager said.\n\nMr Douglass rubbished suggestions that the US equity market is expensive, saying: \"It's the biggest load of nonsense I've ever heard.\" Some sectors had uneasy valuations, he agreed.\n\nThe fund managers discussed software as a service (SaaS) stocks, which Mr Clifford thought were \"starting to look like they're in a good bear market\".\n\n\"The most scary ones are in Australia, because there's only a small number to choose from. The US ones are much better quality, prospects,\" Mr Clifford said. \"They're on very high valuations there too, but not as high as some of the ones here.\"\n\nMr Douglass volunteered that Microsoft was \"the best software as a service company in the world\" but it was not trading at comparable multiples.\n\n\"We own it in a big way.\"", "description": "\"Very low interest rates aren't good for savers and it's not good for banks,\" says Hamish Douglass as he and Andrew Clifford ponder a world where interest rates return to positive territory and the equity market is totally unprepared for it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2693%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_356%2C$y_214/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/aa586b3e5970a05f6bfab77fb020f2ed80c014ba", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
