Businesses also find it hard to navigate the system despite the establishment of special \u201cprecincts\u201d and ecosystems to encourage them.\n\nAdd in Australia\u2019s big universities which traditionally compete rather than collaborate. Their main interest is in using the massive fee income from international students numbers to fund individual university research to climb global rankings to attrat more international students.\n\nWhile NSW has been good at building hard infrastructure the state needs to develop more soft infrastructure to connect it all up.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into research useful for the Australian economy or the biggest domestic dilemmas facing governments. And naturally, there\u2019s always a degree of interstate state rivalry with the common view that Victoria takes a more coordinated and focused approach than NSW to attracting investment.\n\nAustralia has fallen to 22nd in the latest Global Innovation Index, which measures a country's inventiveness from research and development investments and international patent and trademark applications, to mobile-phone app creation and high-tech exports.\n\nIt\u2019s that reality behind the NSW government\u2019s move to try to speed up coordination in research and development to tackle some of its major policy challenges, David Gonski is chancellor of the University of NSW as well as chair of ANZ and the council includes a range of other university chancellors and business leaders \u2013 along with the state's chief scientist, Hugh Durrant-Whyte.\n\nGabrielle Upton, parliamentary secretary to the NSW Premier and a former deputy chancellor, says there\u2019s every good reason for NSW to rate better than it does on R &D given its leading universities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat means making it easier for universities, governments and businesses to work together in a strategic way, including when applying for grants or policy changes. While NSW has been good at building hard infrastructure, she says, the state needs to develop more soft infrastructure to connect it all up.\n\n\u201cWe want to use this group to focus on the big public policy challenges we need to grapple with,\u201d she tells The Australian Financial Review. \u201cWe know that R &D is not the whole answer to having an innovation economy but we can road test some of the gaps and learn how we can do better.\u201d\n\nDurrant-Whyte has a favourite quote he recites to state government ministers: \u201cVision without execution is hallucination.\u201d That seems even more valid now than it did when Thomas Edison came up with it.\n\nDurrant-Whyte is also familiar with the intersection of business and academia, having led the R &D behind the automation of Port Botany as well as contributed to the automation of iron ore mines in the Pilbara in his previous role as professor of robotics and automation as the University of Sydney. He still works for Rio Tinto one day a week.\n\nWhat excites him, he says, is to look at challenges but also business and research opportunities in key areas \u2013 like the energy transition or water and drought resilience or efficiency in health \u2013 to see how R &D can be made to work for the economy.\n\nHe wants to accelerate the work of the Waratah Research Network established in the last year to better coordinate departmental needs and research with that of universities to become more of a partnership.\n\n\u201cUniversities are a very important part of the economic system, developing research as well as delivering a supply of skilled people,\u201d he says. \u201cAcademics have become more interested in translational research in the last ten to 15 years with about 30 per cent of the revenue for research now coming from companies rather than government grants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut are we as quick and agile as some other states? Probably not yet.\"\n\nUpton says it has been difficult to measure figures but the best estimate in terms of NSW state government spending on R &D is about $400 million out of total investment of about $11 billion last year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more research than there is development to help communities and to help solve social and economic problems,\u201d she says. \u201cIs there a way that the government can help that translational piece?\u201c\n\nWhat intrigues Gonski is \u201cthe ability to coordinate and extend what NSW is doing in R &D to maximise the availability of funds and true focus.\u201d\n\nExecution, as ever, is the key.", "description": "The economy doesn\u2019t have the number of big technology companies pouring money into R&D while many smaller businesses find it difficult to know where to start.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2305%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fed74374551c40af06f608c3aac43aa2f14676f4", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
