(AP) - The Nutrition Hub at Church Health was designed to be a gathering place, pretty much like the kitchen in any home.\n\nOn Oct. 21, knots of cooks were huddled amid cooktops and countertops, tasting greens and spaghetti sauces, and making value judgments that transcend mere right and wrong.\n\nThese were church people, learning in Church Health\u2019s Feed the Flock program how to cut the fat and up the veggies and spices in the thousands of meals served each week in area church kitchens.\n\n\u201cThis is what we call standard American spaghetti,\u201d said Kimberly Boone, a registered dietitian. \u201cIt has white noodles, and it\u2019s made with 80/20 beef.\n\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s turn over the reveals,\u201d she said, as heads nodded and interest piqued when two healthier spaghetti sauce ingredients came into view.\n\n\u201cThe better sauce on the left has less meat, but we amped up the flavor with seasoning, and we added more vegetables, specifically mushrooms because they have umami,\u201d she said.\n\nThroughout the morning, church cooks tasted versions of Southern comfort staples labeled \u201cgood,\u201d \u201dbetter\u201d and \u201cbest,\u201d and then began making their own ingredient alterations to classics like banana pudding, fried chicken and rich barbecue sauces.\n\nBy 11:30 a.m., they were ready to march into their institutional kitchens and roll out some change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already cut the meat out of the green beans on Wednesday nights,\u201d said Tameka Wilkerson, in charge of vegan offerings and special meals at Brown Missionary Baptist Church, which easily has 12,000 members.\n\n\u201cIf we do fried chicken, we\u2019ll make sure we have baked chicken too,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be using more natural sweets. Instead of sugar, we can use beets. We\u2019ll put labels on the vegan and vegetarian items.\u201d\n\nThe idea, she said, and Church Health concurs, is that once people realize vegetarian options taste good and have health benefits, others will follow.\n\nFor months, Church Health has planned the rollout of Feed the Flock by first surveying church cooks, then gathering focus groups and fine-tuning recipes.\n\n\u201cDr. (Scott) Morris always says that the worst meal you are going to eat all week is probably at church,\u201d Rachel Davis, Church Health\u2019s director of faith and health programs laughed, referencing the nonprofit\u2019s founder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful fellowship opportunity, but unfortunately, we are feeding ourselves things that make the members of our faith community not as healthy as they could be,\u201d she said.\n\nWith diseases like hypertension and diabetes that have such links to diet in Memphis, Davis said, the work has significant health benefits.\n\n\u201cWhile we are known for our clinical services, one of the key reasons we have church in our name is because our mission is caring for bodies and spiritual health,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Church Health also knows that to roll out menus of chickpeas and kale would be a disaster. So it collected cherished church comfort recipes, including macaroni and cheese, and then came up with three takes on the same recipe, with incremental nutritional improvements in each.\n\nIt also conducted the nutrition analysis on each recipe - replacing bacon in greens with a dried smoked pepper, for instance, saves 900 milligrams of sodium - offered ways to sell the improvements to the pastor and suggested novel strategies for staging church kitchen tasting dinners.\n\nEach participant received a packet of materials, including recipes.\n\nThe session began with a panel discussion, then broke into smaller groups for the recipe work and samplings so there was plenty of time for back and forth with the experts and each other.\n\n\u201cI was impressed with how open they were,\u201d said Symone Johnson, culinary medicine specialist at Church Health.\n\n\u201cThey knew exactly how to make the recipes better. And they knew what their congregations would like and that even if they made small changes, they\u2019d be making a difference.\u201d\n\nLate last week, 15 churches or faith projects had registered for the class. When it began, seven more had enrolled for the free session. It generated such positive comments, Church Health is now considering ways to expand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re toying with adding more sessions on specifics,\u201d said Melissa Peterson, operations manager for the Nutrition Hub.\n\nSharon and David Mullins run Team Laeth, a meal program for homeless people, which they cook and manage out of First United Methodist Church.\n\nThe challenge is providing the well-seasoned food Sharon is used to cooking, but with less salt.\n\n\u201cThey say they like our food the best because it\u2019s seasoned, and we also put salt and pepper shakers on the tables,\u201d David Mullins said. \u201cThe other groups that are providing meals don\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nSharon left the class thinking she can contribute to the health of people whose lives are already endangered by homelessness by learning new ways to season food, including using salt substitutes.\n\nThinking of church kitchens and church cooks as change agents was not on anyone\u2019s radar, Davis said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a church setting. I think the biggest issue is keeping the cost of the food as low as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nReplacing some or all of the meat in spaghetti sauce with lentils, for instance, not only knocked the price per serving down significantly but also cut 100 calories, a fact she thinks churches can expand on with holistic ministries.\n\nShe also noted that none of the recipes included bread or breading.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cheap. It\u2019s what people are used to and it\u2019s easy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the challenge is that carbohydrates in the body process as sugar. If you are diabetic, it is just as bad for you as eating something that is all sugar.\u201d\n\nJohnson was doing a little math in her head as the participants were leaving Church Health in the Crosstown Concourse.\n\n\u201cThese people have a lot of power to make changes,\u201d she said. \u201cIf one voice can reach a million people, think what 22 can do.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Nutrition Hub at Church Health was designed to be a gathering place, pretty much like the kitchen in any home.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jane Roberts", "The Daily Memphian"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
