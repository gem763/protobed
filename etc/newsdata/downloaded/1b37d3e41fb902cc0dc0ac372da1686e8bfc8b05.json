And perhaps even more in the countryside, where you can hide completely.\u201d\n\nVan Dijk said she and her husband had seen a man driving in and out of the property for years and doing construction work. He always kept the gates closed and never socialised, she said.\n\nHer husband Sjon said he once asked to see how the renovations were coming along, but the man yelled \u201cno\u201d and sped off.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cWe tried to make contact, my husband just last week, with the man in the car...(But) he drove on.
