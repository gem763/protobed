Lorenzo Reyes delivers this weeks power rankings and biggest risers and fallers. USA TODAY\n\nMaybe this will put all the comeback talk on hold.\n\nFormer New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski has joined FOX Sports to be an analyst for its programming. Gronkowski will make his debut on FOX NFL Thursday, as part of the network\u2019s coverage of the game between the New York Giants and the Patriots.\n\n\"We're thrilled Rob chose FOX Sports for the next phase of his football life,\" executive producer and the executive vice president of production and operations Brad Zager said Tuesday in a statement. \"He is one of the most popular players to ever play the game and also one of the best tight ends in NFL history. His passion for the game and larger-than-life personality make him a perfect fit for FOX Sports.\"\n\nNFL power rankings: New teams enter top 10 following losses by Cowboys, Chargers\n\nMore: 49ers send statement in remaining perfect: 'You want idiots to sound like idiots'\n\nGronkowski played nine seasons for New England and is considered by many to be the greatest tight end of all time. He caught 521 passes for 7,861 yards and 79 touchdowns and helped New England win three Super Bowls during his tenure. A five-time Pro Bowl selection and four-time all-pro, Gronkowski also excelled as a blocker.\n\n\"I'm extremely excited to be joining FOX Sports,\" Gronkowski said Tuesday in a statement. \"For the past 25 years, they've offered viewers top-notch NFL programming from the field to the booth to the studio. Their deep talent roster is unmatched, which was important for me as I embark on this new chapter in my life because I'll be able to learn from the best in the business.\"\n\nGronkowski retired from the NFL in March, though there has been plenty of speculation that he would seek to return. Still only 30 years old, Gronkowski had a career filled with several significant injuries that kept him away from the field for large stretches and likely shortened his playing career.\n\nSince announcing his retirement, Gronkowski has partnered with a company that produces CBD products that aim to relieve pain from sports injuries.\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.", "description": "Former Patriot tight end Rob Gronkowski will return to football as a FOX Sports analyst on broadcasts, starting with Thursday's game at New England.", "authors": ["Lorenzo Reyes", "Published A.M.
