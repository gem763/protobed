Now, futures traders can now choose leveraged positions between 1x and 125x, it said Friday.\n\n\u201cWe have seen an increase in institutional participation in trading \u2026 And they are flocking to Binance Futures,\u201d said Binance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao in a statement. \u201cThe market has been demanding a product with superior stability and performance; now we are providing one.\u201d\n\nMax leverage positions on Binance now exceed crypto exchange BitMEX\u2019s futures leverage positions, which top off at 100x for some contracts.\n\nNoted economist and crypto skeptic Nouriel Roubini has previously argued that, in providing such high leverage, exchanges are exposing traders to too much risk.\n\nBinance said its BTC futures contract provides a built-in hedging tool to help traders manage that risk. Further, the exchange said it\u2019s providing an \u201cinsurance fund\u201d (the firm\u2019s quotation marks) that \u201chelps to limit the chances of auto-deleverage.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes amidst tightening competition in the bitcoin futures space. Intercontinental Exchange\u2019s Bakkt bitcoin futures exchange launched this September. Although the exchange\u2019s initial volume disappointed critics, the exchange has already conducted its first block trade for two institutional investors.\n\nCZ image courtesy of Binance", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CZ-Binance-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
