Alibaba Buys NetEase Online Mall for $2 Billion in Rare Pact\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group ADR (NYSE: ) bought NetEase's (NASDAQ: ) Kaola e-commerce platform for about $2 billion and invested in its music streaming service, forging a rare partnership between two of China\u2019s largest internet giants.\n\nThe deal hands Alibaba the biggest Chinese online marketplace for foreign brands after its own Tmall Import and Export. Kaola will now operate independently but under new Chief Executive Officer Alvin Liu, a Tmall veteran. Separately, Alibaba and billionaire co-founder Jack Ma\u2019s Yunfeng Capital will invest $700 million in NetEase Cloud Music. NetEase remains the controlling shareholder of its music app.\n\nAlibaba and NetEase -- both based in the prosperous eastern city of Hangzhou -- have long fought social media titan Tencent Holdings Ltd. across several fronts but the landscape is shifting. The emergence of Tencent-backed rivals like Pinduoduo Inc. is testing Alibaba\u2019s dominance of retail. NetEase has long been a distant runner-up to Tencent in gaming and now also music streaming, while Alibaba has its own music app Xiami. The sale of the low-margin Kaola platform now allows NetEase to focus on its bread-and-butter gaming business.\n\n\u201cNetEase can further optimize its costs while Alibaba strengthens its leadership in cross-border e-commerce,\u201d Thomas Chong and Ken Chong, analysts at Jefferies, wrote Friday. \u201cOn the other hand, we believe NetEase Cloud Music can benefit from potential synergies with the Alibaba ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe Kaola deal creates a dominant bazaar for consumers seeking foreign labels and goods. Alibaba and Kaola, which is loss-making on an operational level, controlled almost 60% of all transactions on China-based platforms for foreign brands in the second quarter, according to research firm Analysys.\n\nIt also deepens a seeming alliance. NetEase founder William Ding and Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang exchanged good-natured banter during a long TV interview aired in China just last month. Asked about their rivalry, Ding joked: \u201cMany of our employees might be husbands and wives.\u201d\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence says:\n\nAlibaba\u2019s $2 billion acquisition of Kaola, NetEase\u2019s cross-border e-commerce platform, will make it the go-to channel for Chinese consumers seeking high-quality foreign products.\n\nThe investment will prove welcome to NetEase, which like Alibaba has grappled with rising content costs.\n\nNetEase Music most recently raised $600 million in November when Baidu Inc (NASDAQ: )., General Atlantic and Boyu Capital participated in a fundraising round. The latest capital injection comes after China\u2019s antitrust authority launched a probe into its much larger rival, Tencent Music Entertainment Group, over its licensing practices. Under government pressure, Tencent Music and NetEase Music last year agreed to relicense more than 99% of their music catalogs to each other.\n\n\u201cWhat really matters is the 1% exclusive content,\u201d said Shawn Yang, a Shenzhen-based analyst with Blue Lotus. \u201cNow that NetEase has new funding that can be used to buy copyrights, it will definitely be a threat to TME.\u201d", "description": "Alibaba Buys NetEase Online Mall for $2 Billion in Rare Pact", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA5T0Y4_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
