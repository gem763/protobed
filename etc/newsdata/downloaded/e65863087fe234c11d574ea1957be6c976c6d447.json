blackouts the new normal for the state?", "language": "en", "text": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Millions of people lost electricity this week in California as the state\u2019s utility giant PG&E sought to prevent catastrophic wildfires, leading many to question whether such power shutoffs will become the new normal.\n\nThe unprecedented outages plunged large swaths of Northern California in the dark, forcing the closure of schools and businesses and prompting backlash and questions on how this could happen in a state that boasts the world\u2019s fifth largest economy.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be, respectfully, the new normal,\u201d fumed Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday as he spoke with reporters. \u201cAnd it is a false choice to say it\u2019s hardship or safety.\u201d\n\nPG&E, the state\u2019s largest private utility company that services some 5.4 million customers in the northern and central part of the state, has defended the shutoffs that affected about two million people as necessary to prevent wildfires that could be sparked by lines downed in heavy winds.\n\nLast November, PG&E\u2019s faulty power lines were determined to have sparked the deadliest wildfire in the state\u2019s modern history, which killed 86 and destroyed the town of Paradise.\n\nPower lines were also behind devastating fires in 2017 in the Napa wine region.\n\nPG&E, which filed for bankruptcy in January, has argued the outages this week were necessary for safety reasons and said it will take days before power is restored to all customers as employees beforehand must check the grid in person or electronically.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Not adequately prepared\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe beleaguered company also warned that such shutoffs could be ordered annually until its aging power grid and power lines can be updated to handle fire hazards.\n\nExperts believe such an overhaul can take a decade to complete, especially as PG&E is undergoing a massive reorganization linked to the multi-billion dollar settlements it has had to pay victims of last year\u2019s fire.\n\nBill Johnson, the company CEO, apologized at a news conference Thursday evening for the massive power cuts ordered this week and admitted the agency had poorly handled the issue.\n\n\u201cWe were not adequately prepared,\u201d he admitted, while defending the decision. \u201cWe faced a choice here between hardship on everyone and safety, and we chose safety.\u201d\n\nHis argument, however, was dismissed by many, including the governor, who blasted PG&E for failing to invest enough in recent years to upgrade its power lines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s decisions that were not made that have led to this moment in PG&E\u2019s history in the state of California,\u201d Newsom told a news conference.\n\n\u201cThis is not, from my perspective, a climate change story as much as a story about greed and mismanagement over the course of decades,\u201d he added. \u201cNeglect, a desire to advance not public safety but profits.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Lives disrupted\u2019 \u2013\n\nMikhael Chester, a professor of sustainable energy at Arizona State University, said even if billions of dollars were spent to upgrade utility grids, power shutdowns would continue to happen as infrastructure could not be expected to be \u201cone hundred percent reliable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have pushed infrastructure to a point where we are going to have to recognize that reliability is going to become compromised more and more often,\u201d he told Popular Science magazine.\n\nAs to suggestions that California bury its power lines underground to ward off wildfire, experts say such a solution comes down to cost and time.\n\nIt costs approximately $3 million per mile to convert underground electric distribution lines from overhead, while the cost to build new overhead lines is approximately $150 per foot or $800,000 per mile, PG&E says on its website.\n\nSeverin Borenstein, a University of California Berkeley professor of business administration and public policy who specializes in energy, said given the state of affairs, Californians should brace for blackouts becoming regular occurrences.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty lucky in California that we have far fewer weather disruptions than in other parts of the country,\u201d he told National Public Radio.\n\nIn coming years, however, he added that the state must seriously address the threat of wildfires \u201cand do a lot more preparation and have our lives disrupted for a few days a year at least.\u201d", "description":
