This meant many of his victims\u2019 bodies were originally not identified, and causes of death were first thought to have been as a result of an overdose, accident or an undetermined cause.\n\nLittle\u2019s history of crimes began early, in his teenage years, with what, in comparison to his later crimes, were minor crimes of shoplifting, fraud, breaking and entering and drugs.\n\nBut, the FBI said, even then there were \u201cclear signs of a violent streak\u201d.\n\nLittle had dropped out of high-school, leaving his Ohio home, and was living a \u201cnomadic life\u201d when his life began taking him along a path of crime.\n\n\u201cHe would shoplift and steal in a city or town to gather the money to buy alcohol and drugs, but never stayed in one place for long,\u201d described the FBI.\n\n\u201cHe would drive from New Jersey to California in a matter of days, reports Palazzolo, and when he had his many run-ins with police, they often just wanted to shoo him out of town.\u201d\n\nLittle's victims were typically More\n\nIn the early 1980s he was charged with the killing of women in Mississippi and Florida, but with limited ability to analyse DNA evidence, officials were unable to prosecute him.\n\nThen in 2012 Little was arrested, at a Kentucky homeless shelter, and taken to California where he was wanted on a narcotics charge.\n\nWhile in custody law enforcement took a DNA sample which matched him to three victims of the then-unsolved murders committed in Los Angeles between 1987 and 1989.\n\nLittle pleaded not-guilty to the crimes, but in 2014 he was convicted and sentenced to three consecutive life sentences with no possibility of parole for the three deaths.\n\n\u201cIn all three cases, the women had been beaten and then strangled, their bodies dumped in an alley, a dumpster, and a garage,\u201d the FBI said.\n\nFollowing this the criminal investigation agency began looking further into his background and found an \u201calarming pattern\u201d that linked Little to a number of other murders.\n\nThey enlisted Texas Ranger James Holland to interview Little \u2013 who, in exchange for a move to a different prison, began to confess.\n\nIn pain-staking detail, Little, described how his victims looked and the killings \u2013 though the FBI said when it came to exact dates he was a little fuzzy, making it challenging for officials to corroborate.\n\nIn an effort to get the public\u2019s help in matching the remaining unconfirmed confessions Little made the FBI has published a site with a number of key details.\n\nIt includes a timeline and map detailing his confessions, well as a series of artist sketches and videos \u201cin hopes that someone may remember a detail that could further the investigation\u201d.", "description": "An elderly convict who confessed to 93 murders of \u201cmarginalized and vulnerable\u201d women across a period spanning 35 years is the United States\u2019 most prolific serial killer, the FBI said.Samuel Little, 79, made the confessions to a Texas ranger while serving time for the murder of three Los Angeles women", "authors": ["Corazon Miller"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fL5qmlSFUVW_SvGntkaKcg--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/050365193780805deaad7cfc103710f2", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
