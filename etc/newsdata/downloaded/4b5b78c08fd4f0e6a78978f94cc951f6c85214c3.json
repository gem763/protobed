Intermittent clashes continue despite a notional ceasefire and diplomatic peace efforts.\n\nLast week Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of delaying the summit because Moscow says Kiev needs to pull back its troops first.\n\nSpeaking before addressing EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg, Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told Reuters the summit would have to follow a seven-day ceasefire and the withdrawal of light weapons from the east.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still hopeful, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t even be trying,\u201d Prystaiko said. \u201cWe have some dates ... we are aiming for the middle of next month, somewhere around mid-November.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve told everyone openly that we are making maybe the last honest attempt to follow the Minsk path,\u201d he said, referring to the original 2014-2015 peace deal signed in the Belarusian capital.\n\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work, we will have to look to some plan B,\u201d Prystaiko added, although he declined to say what that might be.\n\nHe said there had been no progress on a limited U.N. peacekeeping mission to eastern Ukraine suggested by Russian President Vladimir Putin, although it remained an option.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to create stability if hostilities cease, because we are talking about peacekeeping, not peace-creating,\u201d he said.\n\nPutin, Zelenskiy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron would attend the Paris summit.\n\nSPECIAL STATUS\n\nIn a breakthrough, Ukrainian, Russian and separatist negotiators agreed last month that Kiev would grant the territory controlled by the separatists a special status and hold local elections there.\n\nUnder the agreement, separatist fighters and Ukrainian troops would also pull back from the line of contact.\n\nBut the pullback, originally scheduled for Oct. 7, has not happened yet because Ukraine has accused the separatists of shelling its positions and said it would only withdraw after a straight week of full ceasefire observance.\n\nPrystaiko stressed that the breakthrough with negotiators focused on local polls, not parliamentary elections, and there was no plan to create a federal Ukrainian state. The country of 42 million has borders both with Russia and countries in the European Union and NATO such as Poland and Romania.\n\nMany in Ukraine, whose constitution now commits it to seeking EU and NATO membership, fear Russia could acquire a veto over Ukrainian decision-making if separatist politicians in the east were given a voice in the parliament in Kiev.\n\nMoscow is fiercely opposed to Ukraine joining the Western clubs.\n\n\u201cWe had one autonomous region, and that was Crimea, and it is very well known what happened there,\u201d he said, referring to Moscow\u2019 2014 seizure of the peninsula following the ouster of a pro-Kremlin president in Kiev amid mass street protests.", "description": "The leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany could hold a summit in Paris in mid-November if Kiev and pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine can maintain a ceasefire, Ukraine's foreign minister said on Monday, warning of a \"last chance\" for Moscow.", "authors": ["Robin Emmott", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
