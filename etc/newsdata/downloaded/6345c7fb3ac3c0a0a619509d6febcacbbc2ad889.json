REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun\n\nFighting for political survival after an inconclusive ballot in April, the right-wing Netanyahu has made voter fraud a key issue in his campaign for a fifth term, cautioning that victory could be stolen from him in what polls show to be a close race.\n\nIn the previous election, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party sent monitors equipped with body cameras to a several polling stations with Arab constituents in what Arab politicians described as voter intimidation.\n\nOn election days in Israel, representatives of most parties sit at venues to check the pre-vote identification process. Voters are then handed an envelope and go behind a screen to cast their ballot in private.\n\nAddressing his cabinet on Sunday, Netanyahu said that under the legislation, which will go to parliament for approval before the Sept. 17 election, monitors will be able to use their cellular telephone cameras to record outside of the actual voting booth.\n\n\u201cEveryone films,\u201d Netanyahu said in public remarks at the meeting. \u201cAny shop is filmed by cameras, so the polling stations are the only places where you can\u2019t film?\u201d\n\nIn his comments to the cabinet, which government officials said approved the legislation unanimously, Netanyahu pledged: \u201cThe secrecy of the vote will be strictly preserved.\u201d\n\nAyman Odeh, head of the Arab Joint List party, said on Twitter that Netanyahu\u2019s focus on the issue of voter fraud was aimed at \u201ctriggering a panic vote\u201d by his supporters on the right and \u201csuppressing the Arab vote\u201d.\n\n\u201c(Netanyahu) is preparing the ground for the day he declares, \u2018Arabs have stolen the elections\u2019, and contests the results if he loses,\u201d Odeh said.\n\nYair Lapid, co-leader of the centrist Blue and White Party, which is running neck-and-neck with Likud in polls, alluded to the impact the deployment of cameras might have on Arab voter turnout, describing the bill as \u201cracist\u201d in comments on Twitter.\n\nArabs make up 21 percent of Israel\u2019s population and generally vote not for Likud but for their own Arab parties or centrist or left-wing Jewish parties.\n\nThe proposed bill was opposed by the head of the Central Election Commission that oversees the vote, who said the last-minute introduction of cameras might \u201clead to chaos\u201d.\n\nAttorney-General Avichai Mandelblit, who advises the cabinet on legal issues, also came out against the legislation, saying it could violate laws ensuring voters\u2019 privacy.\n\nFor that reason, most Western democracies have restrictions on the use of cameras at ballot stations.\n\nTwo weeks after the election, Mandelblit will hold a pre-trial hearing in which Netanyahu can argue against his announced intent to indict him in three corruption cases. Netanyahu, in office for the past 10 years, has denied any wrongdoing.", "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet approved draft legislation on Sunday to have cameras monitor polling stations in Israel's election next week, a move opponents said was effectively meant to intimidate Arab voters.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427598677&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870JA", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
