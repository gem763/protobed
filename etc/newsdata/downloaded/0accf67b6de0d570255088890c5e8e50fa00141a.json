Instead, the entrepreneur believes Bitcoin to be much more suited for use as a \u201ccurrency for the internet\u201d than anything else available or in the works to date.\n\nDorsey claims that Bitcoin\u2019s resilience, brand, and dependability all make it stand out from the rest of the crypto asset industry. He also commented that open systems, like Bitcoin, were able to serve people better than more centralised alternatives.\n\nDorsey Continues to Champion Bitcoin\n\nJack Dorsey is not shy about his love of Bitcoin. The Twitter and Circle CEO has long said that he thinks Bitcoin is the ideal candidate for a native currency of the internet, something which he firmly believes is needed.\n\nIn an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald published today, Dorsey reaffirmed his long-standing commitment to the number one digital currency by market capitalisation. He stated that the openness of Bitcoin ultimately stood it in good stead to provide greater utility to users than existing or forthcoming alternatives:\n\n\u201cI think open Internet standards serve every person better than ones controlled or started by companies.\u201d Dorsey\u2019s conviction that Bitcoin will one day be the dominant currency used online has meant that he shuns efforts like those of fellow social media firm Facebook. During the interview held to promote his payments company Square, he firmly stated that he has no plans to use Twitter\u2019s popularity to make moves into the financial industry himself. For the Twitter CEO, Bitcoin not only offers a completely open system of finance but has also proved itself over ten years as reliable and dependable. Dorsey told the publication: \u201cI think [Bitcoin\u2019s] the best bet because it\u2019s been the most resilient, it\u2019s around for 10 years, it has a great brand and it\u2019s been tested a bunch.\u201d He added that he still thought it highly probably that it would one day be the dominant means of exchange online. Evidently, Dorsey has no intention of attracting the kind of regulatory heat that Facebook has since it detailed its plans to launch a digital currency in June of this year. After formerly announcing Libra, the company has been the focus of a lot of scrutiny. Instead, the Circle and Twitter CEO is known to be a financial contributor to a company developing the Bitcoin micropayments layer, Lightning Network. He was also involved in an effort to raise awareness of the scaling technology known as the Lightning Torch earlier this year. The initiative saw high profile figures from technology and beyond sending a small amount of Bitcoin via the network to another individual to demonstrate the network\u2019s efficacy for making very small payments.\n\nRelated Reading: Altcoins May Be Ready to Bounce as Bitcoin Dominance Peaks\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock.", "description": "Jack Dorsey still thinks that Bitcoin will be the dominant currency used online.
