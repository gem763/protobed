To America\u2019s largest house of worship , the 40,000-member Lakewood Church, she is the statuesque blonde who spearheaded the megachurch\u2019s ministry for women and preached weekly sermonettes about the divine good life. To the seven million weekly viewers of the television show she does with Lakewood\u2019s pastor, Joel Osteen, she is a celebrity and life coach, the author of spiritual chick lit like her New York Times best-selling \u201cLove Your Life.\u201d Blogs debate everything from her likability to the height of her heels. When she sat down for an interview with Oprah in the Osteen family\u2019s Texas mansion, there was little doubt that, loved or hated, she was a new kind of pastor\u2019s wife. Tucked into Joel\u2019s arm, she rules as one of evangelicalism\u2019s first ladies. This is the presumed order of Christian megaministry, the Adam and the Eve.\n\nIn almost every spiritual empire, there is a \u201cshe.\u201d Her hair is big. Her smile is bigger. She is standing by her man, and if he is preaching, she is always ready with a confirming nod. Skeptics dismiss her as evangelical arm candy or, worse, more fodder for a Margaret Atwood sequel. Yet despite their influence and wealth, these women are, in the main, denied the most important symbol of spiritual power \u2014 the pulpit.\n\nI expected to write the history of these evangelical celebrity women on my ascent into scholarly glory, securing a place in academic Valhalla (and tenure at Duke Divinity School). Instead, I studied these leading ladies in the infusion center at Duke Hospital, a short walk away from my quiet office, where I had first learned the news that I had Stage 4 cancer. Tumors that bloomed in my colon and liver, in a moment, erased every cheerful ambition and casual plan. And all I could see was my husband and my toddler, Zach, who loves me more than dinosaurs.\n\nIn an effort to manage my fear, I distracted myself by inviting the famous women of televangelism to stop by the hospital for an interview. As I was struggling against my own limitations, I discovered that most of these people were quite willing to admit their own. Together, we spent hundreds of hours discussing the narrow and precarious paths of power that women tread. We were all hanging by a thread.", "description": "She may not run the church.
