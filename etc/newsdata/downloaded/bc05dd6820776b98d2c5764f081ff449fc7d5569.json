They later attempted, but failed, to storm parliament.\n\nCatalonia\u2019s independence is reaching a turning point with a verdict expected in the first half of October in the trial of 12 separatist leaders for their role in the 2017 independence referendum and declaration.\n\nA poll published in July by a public Catalan institute showed support for an independent Catalonia at its lowest level in two years, with 48.3% of people against and 44% in favor.", "description": "Spanish police arrested nine activists on Monday linked to Catalonia's pro-independence movement who may have been preparing violent actions, seizing material authorities believe could be used to make explosives.", "authors": ["Jose El\u00edas Rodr\u00edguez", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
