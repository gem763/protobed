She was best known for her roles in \"Julia\" and \"Dynasty.\" USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Diahann Carroll, the Oscar-nominated actress and singer who won critical acclaim as the first black woman to star in a non-servant role in a TV series as \"Julia,\" has died. She was 84.\n\nCarroll's daughter, Susan Kay, told The Associated Press her mother died Friday in Los Angeles of cancer.\n\nDuring her long career, Carroll earned a Tony Award for the musical \"No Strings\" and an Academy Award nomination for \"Claudine.\"\n\nBut she was perhaps best known for her pioneering work on \"Julia.\" Carroll played Julia Baker, a nurse whose husband had been killed in Vietnam, in the groundbreaking situation comedy that aired from 1968 to 1971.\n\nAlthough she was not the first black woman to star in her own TV show (Ethel Waters played a maid in the 1950s series \"Beulah\"), she was the first to star as someone other than a servant.\n\nNBC executives were wary about putting \"Julia\" on the network during the racial unrest of the 1960s, but it was an immediate hit.\n\nIt had its critics, though, including some who said Carroll's character, who is the mother of a young son, was not a realistic portrayal of a black American woman in the 1960s.\n\n\"They said it was a fantasy,\" Carroll recalled in 1998. \"All of this was untrue. Much about the character of Julia I took from my own life, my family.\"\n\nNot shy when it came to confronting racial barriers, Carroll won her Tony portraying a high-fashion American model in Paris who has a love affair with a white American author in the 1959 Richard Rodgers musical \"No Strings.\" Critic Walter Kerr described her as \"a girl with a sweet smile, brilliant dark eyes and a profile regal enough to belong on a coin.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/04/diahann-carroll-oscar-nominated-actress-dies/3864892002/", "description": "Diahann Carroll's daughter, Susan Kay, told The Associated Press her mother died Friday in Los Angeles of cancer.", "authors": ["The Associated Press", "Published P.M.
