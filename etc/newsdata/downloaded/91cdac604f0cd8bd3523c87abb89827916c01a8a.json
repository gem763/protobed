Analysts polled by FactSet had expected a profit of SEK3.76 billion.\n\nAt 0819 GMT, shares were 6.6 % higher at SEK196.58, a level not seen since December 2017.\n\nAs previously announced, sales rose to SEK62.57 billion from SEK55.82 billion in the quarter, while net sales in September are estimated to have increased by 8% on the year in local currencies.\n\nStockholm-based H&M is in the midst of a major shift toward online sales and improved logistics as fewer shoppers visit its physical stores, while at the same time grappling with overstocking that has previously prompted hefty clearance sales at lower margins.\n\nCosts in the quarter increased by SEK2.67 billion as the company continued to invest in its store and online expansion, AI, technology, logistics and its customer loyalty program. Activity levels for the company's transformation work will remain high, including continued upgrades in the supply chain, it said.\n\nThese efforts are starting to bear fruit however, H&M said. After a strong summer collection, the autumn range has made a promising start with shoppers greeting early collections with a positive reception, while an increasingly broader online offering and continuing improvements in its logistics infrastructure have also helped boost the top line. The retailer saw double-digit percentage sales growth in markets such as the U.S., Russia, Italy and India, but things were a bit tougher in some of its franchise markets due to challenging macro factors, it added.\n\nThe company managed to reduce the amount of stock it holds by 1% in the quarter, leading to a 2 percentage-point fall in markdowns in relation to sales, beating previous guidance for a 1.5 percentage-point drop in the third quarter.\n\n\"The continued development of more full-price sales and reduced markdowns contributed to a 26% increase in operating profit in the third quarter, all while maintaining a high level of activity in our transformation work,\" said Chief Executive Karl-Johan Persson.\n\nAs a result of accelerating its adaptation to customers' changed shopping patterns, H&M said it has revised the number of new stores downward in favor of more digital investments. The net addition of new stores for 2019 will now be around 120, which is 10 fewer than previously guided.\n\nWrite to Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 03, 2019 05:05 ET (09:05 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
