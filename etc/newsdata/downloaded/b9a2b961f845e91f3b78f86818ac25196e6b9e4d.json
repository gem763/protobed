UFC officials announced the winners following the event, which MMA Junkie attended.\n\nAdesanya (18-0 MMA, 7-0 UFC) captured the undisputed middleweight title with a second-round knockout of champion Robert Whittaker (20-5 MMA, 11-3 UFC) in the main event. Adesanya was the interim champ coming in and unified the titles with his victory, making him an undefeated UFC champion. He debuted in the promotion in 2018, making his path to the title about 20 months long. Adesanya\u2019s bonus gives him six post-fight awards in seven fights in the UFC.\n\nGallery Israel Adesanya def.

He picked up a walk-off knockout of Justin Tafa (3-1 MMA, 0-1 UFC) with just one punch in their heavyweight fight. De Castro and Tafa threw at the same time, but De Castro\u2019s punch was the one that landed first, and flush.\n\nGallery Yorgan De Castro def.

The barnburner included a third round that was nothing short of ridiculous and featured both men landing bombs in exhausted fashion. Ultimately, Riddell, a teammate of Israel Adesanya, took home a unanimous decision with a pair of 30-26 scores and a 29-27.\n\nGallery Brad Riddell def.
