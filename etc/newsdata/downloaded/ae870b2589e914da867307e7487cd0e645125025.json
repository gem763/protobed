Photo: Barbara Alper/Getty Images\n\nMuch of the coverage of Walmart\u2019s decision to step back from the guns and ammunition business has focused on how the company is (or is not) aligning itself with its customers\u2019 political and social views. I get why people reach for this frame, since it\u2019s the right one for looking at a lot of the polarizing choices corporations have made lately: Nike\u2019s ad campaign with Colin Kaepernick; Gillette\u2019s choice to urge its customers against toxic masculinity; Equinox\u2019s efforts to distance itself from one of its owners\u2019 political activities, and so on.\n\nBut I think this story is different in an important way, and that focusing on the political frame will lead to a misunderstanding of why Walmart made the choice it did.\n\nI don\u2019t think this policy change was mostly about Walmart wanting to send a signal to some customers that it\u2019s aligned with their values and not part of the problem with gun violence in America, though that was probably part of it. I think it\u2019s more about wanting to send a signal to customers and employees that they\u2019re not going to get shot at Walmart.\n\nIt\u2019s worth considering what this company and its employees have been through in recent weeks. There was a horrific mass shooting at one of its El Paso stores. As CEO Doug McMillan noted in his announcement of the new policies, there was a workplace shooting at a store in Mississippi just days before that, where a former employee killed two current ones. And then in the aftermath of these shootings, the company has been having to deal with antisocial persons who have been open-carrying their rifles around Walmart stores just to show they legally can, scaring the crap out of Walmart employees and shoppers and often leading them to call the police.\n\nAfter the El Paso shooting, the Washington Post quoted Erin Rivkind, a customer-service employee at a location in California, who said employees are scouting hiding places in case of a mass shooting and that \u201cwe\u2019re all afraid we\u2019re going to die.\u201d Managers and executives are surely hearing these concerns internally, and companies tend to want to make sure their employees aren\u2019t afraid to come to work, especially in a tight labor market like this one, where they can relatively easily get a job somewhere else.\n\nI\u2019m sure people\u2019s personal attitudes about members of the public flaunting rifles in their vicinity are strongly correlated to political attitudes about gun control. But they are not the same thing as political attitudes about gun control. A customer who\u2019s scared to go to Walmart because of the risk of gun violence (or an employee who thinks about quitting for this reason) isn\u2019t necessarily the sort of person who tries to punish companies for having the wrong values. They may just want self-protection.\n\nThe most relevant policy change in this regard is Walmart\u2019s announcement that it will discourage customers from open-carrying firearms in its stores, even where that is legal, unless they are qualified law-enforcement personnel. It\u2019s worth noting this is not precisely a prohibition, but a \u201crespectful request.\u201d This makes me suspect the impetus for this change is more about employee perceptions of safety than customer perceptions. Many customers (who don\u2019t wish to open-carry) might prefer to be told open-carrying is prohibited outright, but I understand why Walmart doesn\u2019t want to roll out a policy that would obligate its employees to confront armed customers.\n\nThe company says signage about its new open-carry policy will be coming in the next few weeks, and I\u2019ll be interested to see exactly what it says. The CEO\u2019s letter says they will have \u201ca very non-confrontational approach\u201d in discouraging open-carry. If this move encourages open-carry activists to test Walmart, the company may need to take a more aggressive approach.\n\nEnding its sale of handgun ammunition (and of handguns themselves, in the one state where Walmart was selling them: Alaska) does less to directly address the fear of shootings in Walmart stores. I\u2019m sure this choice was partly driven by a decision that selling firearms-related products not suited to hunting was damaging to the company\u2019s reputation among a public where voters who favor gun control are increasingly politically activated around the issue. But taking a step to reduce the association between Walmart\u2019s brand and nonhunting guns may also reduce the perception that the store is a risky place full of armed people.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, in July, before the El Paso shooting, Walmart announced it would stop selling firearms altogether in its New Mexico stores, in response to a new law in that state requiring gun retailers to allow members of the public to bring firearms to their stores to obtain background checks for private gun sales. That is, Walmart would have had to allow customers to bring assault rifles and handguns to its store for transactions even though it\u2019s made a choice not to sell those kinds of firearms. At the time, Walmart told CBS News it didn\u2019t want to have people bringing these kinds of the stores even for lawful transactions, because it might upset customers.\n\nA lot of the commentary on Walmart\u2019s moves away from the gun business have characterized Walmart as principally a rural retailer. Conservatives have groused and liberals have cheered that even this Red America company is souring on guns. But Walmart is too big to be principally rural, since it\u2019s America\u2019s largest retailer and only 19 percent of Americans live in rural areas. Like every other giant corporate or political institution in America, Walmart is accountable foremost to the suburbs. Its moves reflect an acknowledgement that, in suburban America, guns are becoming more trouble than they\u2019re worth for the company \u2014 if not for their political implications, then for direct perceptions of safety at Walmart.\n\nIn one respect, this reflects a tactical mistake on the part of gun-rights activists. The sharp drop in violent crime since 1990 took the wind out of the sails of a once-strong gun-control movement that passed the Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban. Reduced fear of being shot among the public was the best thing gun-rights activists had going for them. But the movement\u2019s countenance of open-carry activists, who want to show people that a high-powered rifle can be carried anywhere, whether or not it should \u2014 even in a Walmart store days after a mass shooting \u2014 has the effect of increasing the salience of gun violence and increasing support for measures to curtail guns, whether those measures are public policy or corporate policy.", "description": "It\u2019s about perceptions of safety by customers and employees.
