What does it all mean? To Siqueiros, Terra Sapiens is an antidote to the wide variety of dystopian images we see in contemporary culture. What he is presenting is an alternative.\n\nSiqueiros says, \"Positive representation of the future is one of the most relevant topics right now because everywhere you look, everything that you see is dystopian; it's negative. So we need to be informed about these initiatives that are already happening that are based in science, that are a reality, that are helping the environment. We need to see those things to be inspired to activate hope and get there.\"\n\nWatch the video:\n\nDamian Siqueiros introduces his project Terra Sapiens and how it offers optimism and scientific perspectives to a vision of this planet's future. Filmmaker: Louis-Martin Charest 2:17\n\nIn this video made by filmmaker Louis-Martin Charest, you'll go inside Siqueiros's studio as he creates pieces of Terra Sapiens, which is the next step in his career that's been marked by what he calls \"artivism\" \u2014 an activist spirit that drives his work that previously dealt with cultural and gender identity.\n\n(CBC Arts)\n\nThe subjects you'll see participating in Terra Sapiens \u2014 produced in partnership with Lembasworks \u2014 include Claudia Chan Tak, Mariette Raina, Hamilton Nieh, Alisia Pobega, Alice Tran, Sanghun Lee, Sabina Son Soon, Vanesa Garcia Montoya, Jungmin Seo, Kiara Felder, Diana Leon and Paco Ziel.
