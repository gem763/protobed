REUTERS/Luke MacGregor/Files\n\nWhat happens now and why did it collapse?\n\nWHO IS AFFECTED?\n\nThe firm ran hotels, resorts and airlines for 19 million travellers a year in 16 countries, generating revenue in 2018 of 9.6 billion pounds ($12 billion). It currently has 600,000 people abroad, including more than 150,000 British citizens.\n\nThomas Cook employs 21,000 people and is the world\u2019s oldest travel company, founded in 1841. The company has 1.7 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) of debt.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS TO TOURISTS?\n\nThe British government has asked the UK Civil Aviation Authority to launch a repatriation programme over the next two weeks, from Monday to Oct. 6, to bring Thomas Cook customers back to the UK.\n\n\u201cDue to the significant scale of the situation, some disruption is inevitable, but the Civil Aviation Authority will endeavour to get people home as close as possible to their planned dates,\u201d it said.\n\nA fleet of aircraft will be used to repatriate British citizens. In a small number of destinations, alternative commercial flights will be used.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority has launched a special website, thomascook.caa.co.uk, where affected customers can find details and information on repatriation flights.\n\nFor those customers not flying from Britain, alternative arrangements will have to be found. In Germany, a popular customer market for Thomas Cook, insurance companies will coordinate the response.\n\nWHAT IS THE ADVICE TO PASSENGERS?\n\n\u201cCustomers currently overseas should not travel to the airport until their flight back to the UK has been confirmed on the dedicated website,\u201d the Civil Aviation Authority said.\n\n\u201cThomas Cook customers in the UK yet to travel should not go to the airport as all flights leaving the UK have been cancelled.\u201d\n\nWHAT DID THE CEO SAY?\n\n\u201cI would like to apologise to our millions of customers, and thousands of employees, suppliers and partners who have supported us for many years,\u201d Thomas Cook CEO Peter Fankhauser said.\n\n\u201cThis marks a deeply sad day for the company which pioneered package holidays and made travel possible for millions of people around the world.\u201d\n\nTHE LIQUIDATION\n\nThomas Cook said it had entered compulsory liquidation and an order had been granted to appoint an official receiver to liquidate the company.\n\nAlixPartners UK LLP or KPMG will be appointed as special managers for the different parts of the business.\n\nWHY DID IT COLLAPSE?\n\nHurt by high debt levels, online rivals and geopolitical uncertainty, Thomas Cook needed another 200 million pounds on top of a 900 million pound package it had already agreed, to see it through the winter months when it receives less cash and must pay hotels for summer services.\n\nThe request for an additional 200 million pounds torpedoed the rescue deal that had been months in the making.\n\nThomas Cook bosses met lenders and creditors in London on Sunday to try to thrash out a last-ditch deal to keep the company afloat. They failed.\n\nUnder the original terms of the plan, Fosun - whose Chinese parent owns all-inclusive holiday firm Club Med - would give 450 million pounds ($552 million) of new money in return for at least 75% of the tour operator business and 25% of its airline.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s lending banks and bondholders were to stump up a further 450 million pounds and convert their existing debt to equity, giving them in total about 75% of the airline and up to 25% of the tour operator business.\n\n($1 = 0.8015 pounds)", "description": "Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel firm, collapsed on Monday, stranding hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers around the globe and sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history.", "authors": ["Kate Holton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432812652&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M05J", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
