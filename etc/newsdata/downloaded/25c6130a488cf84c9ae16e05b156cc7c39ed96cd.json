Every year, over a million people with serious mental illness are booked into jail.\n\nOnce in jail, many individuals don't receive the treatment they need and often their mental health conditions get worse, not better. After leaving jail, many no longer have access to needed healthcare and benefits because of the consequences associated with having a criminal record. Some people, without access to mental health services and support systems, wind up homeless, in emergency rooms and often re-arrested.\n\nLaw enforcement officers frequently aren\u2019t the best people for the job. They typically intervene in situations with mentally ill people when other options have failed, whether it\u2019s therapy, education or medication, and relapses occur. Someone then calls 911 and police officers respond according to their training, which can be at odds with best practices for handling mental health crises.\n\nEven if the interaction between law enforcement and a mentally ill person goes well, the current system is also prohibitively expensive. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, housing an inmate with mental illness in jail costs $31,000 annually, while community mental health services cost about $10,000.\n\nThis heartbreaking dynamic is something I have personal experience with. Growing up, I had a close family member who struggled with addiction. While she luckily had safe interactions with public safety officers and was able to eventually get sober, I saw firsthand how broken our system is when it comes to the way we treat the addicted and mentally ill.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt\u2019s why I founded and lead the pioneering Criminal Justice Mental Health Project in LA County, which has set priorities for a comprehensive mental-health diversion plan that provides alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent offenders, using input from government agencies and community-based organizations.\n\nOur work culminated in the widely acclaimed \"Report from the Mental Health Advisory Board: Blue Print For Change,\" which proposed expanding training for law enforcement personnel and adding community-based beds to house and treat individuals with mental illness, particularly those with criminal records.\n\nAmong other accomplishments, the project secured $150 million in funding from the county for emergency mental health resources and opened five mental health urgent care centers as an alternative to jail, with a sixth one coming soon.\n\nThe project also resulted in the creation of a new county office of diversion and re-entry, a dedicated psychiatric emergency response team that gives fearful families another number to call besides 911, and 39 teams across the county staffed with a police officer and a mental health professional acting as \u201csecond responders\u201d for cases involving mentally ill people.\n\nAdditionally, we also needed to significantly change the way in which we teach public safety officers to respond to incidents of mental health crisis. The DA\u2019s Office now trains hundreds of patrol officers and dispatchers in de-escalation tactics for people undergoing a mental health crisis, and is increasing the number of collaborative courts to divert those who have mental illness, substance abuse, and or post-traumatic stress disorder. This training program, which is attempting to destigmatize mental illness and change the culture of policing, was recognized by the National Association of Counties in 2017.\n\nBut despite all the important progress we\u2019ve made in LA County, we have much more work to do to make our system more equipped to respond effectively and compassionately to incidents of mental health crisis.\n\nIt\u2019s why this week, I\u2019m in Italy attending the World Health Organization\u2019s Conference on Promoting Human Rights & Recovery in Mental Health, to learn how municipalities across the globe are addressing this extremely complex problem. It\u2019s incredibly important for other criminal justice leaders to do the same, and continuously do the difficult work of adapting and upgrading our system to be more compassionate and just while ensuring the safety of everyone.\n\nJackie Lacey is the district attorney of Los Angeles County, first being elected in 2012.
