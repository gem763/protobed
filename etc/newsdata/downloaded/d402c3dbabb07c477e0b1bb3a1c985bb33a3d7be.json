They also decided against calling a vote of no confidence in the government on Monday.\n\nWhile the opposition parties do want a general election, their priority is to ensure Johnson can\u2019t take the U.K. out of the EU on Oct. 31 without a deal -- something he\u2019s threatened to do if he can\u2019t secure a new agreement with Brussels. He has said an election is the only way out of the political impasse, and on Friday accused the parties of denying voters their say.\n\n\u201cThere are people in Parliament who plainly want to block\u201d Brexit, including Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn and the SNP, Johnson told Sky News. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the election -- OK -- perhaps they don\u2019t think they will win. Fine. I\u2019ll go to Brussels, I\u2019ll get a deal, and we\u2019ll make sure we come out on Oct. 31.\u201d\n\nRat in a Trap\n\nUnder legislation passed by the House of Lords on Friday, Johnson will be required to write to the EU to seek a fresh Brexit delay on Oct. 19 if he hasn\u2019t secured a new agreement by then. Plaid Cymru Leader Liz Saville Roberts told Sky News that she doesn\u2019t trust Johnson to obey that law, likening him to a \u201crat in a trap\u201d and predicting he\u2019ll become more aggressive.\n\nOpposition parties must make sure the law \u201cis put into effect and that we remain here as parliamentarians to make sure that the prime minister does his duty by the law,\u201d she said.\n\nThat condition means opposition parties are unlikely to approve a general election until the letter has been written to the EU on Oct. 19, one of the people said. That means no election is likely until November, because at least 25 days must pass between an election being called and it being held.\n\n\u2018Immediate Crisis\u2019\n\n\u201cGiven the behavior of the prime minister and his advisers, we need to be absolutely sure we\u2019re not going to end up in a situation where the general election is going to be used as distraction while they bounce us out without a deal,\u201d Labour\u2019s Foreign Affairs spokeswoman, Emily Thornberry, told BBC radio. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about very long but we need to get this immediate crisis dealt with first.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Johnson stood in a police academy in the north of England, giving a speech that was supposed to mark the start of a month-long snap election campaign. Instead, the embattled leader was trying to fight back after a series of humiliating defeats for his Brexit strategy this week, culminating in the resignation of his own brother in protest at his plans.\n\nTo make matters worse, the West Yorkshire Police complained on Friday about Johnson\u2019s use of student officers for a political speech, which had a section on boosting police numbers but also covered other topics including Brexit and Johnson\u2019s call for an election.\n\nPolice Spat\n\n\u201cWe had no prior knowledge that the speech would be broadened to other issues until it was delivered,\u201d West Yorkshire Chief Constable John Robins said in the statement.\n\nOn Friday, the opposition parties made clear they\u2019re determined to prevent Johnson dictate the timing of an election.\n\nThe SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, told the BBC he\u2019s \u201cdesperate\u201d for a poll, but that the priority is to ensure there\u2019s no \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of a no-deal Brexit as a result of Parliament not sitting during an election campaign.\n\n\u201cWe will have that election when the time is right,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll make you this promise: you\u2019re not going to have a long wait.\u201d\n\n(Updates with no-deal legislation passed by House of Lords.)\n\n--With assistance from Thomas Penny.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Alex Morales in London at amorales2@bloomberg.net;Jessica Shankleman in London at jshankleman@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Stuart Biggs, James Hertling\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow @Brexit,\u00a0sign up to our Brexit Bulletin, and tell us your Brexit story.\u00a0Opposition parties forged a united front to deny Prime Minister Boris Johnson the early general election he wants -- making a poll unlikely until November at the earliest -- to ensure the U.K. can\u2019t tumble out", "authors": ["Alex Morales", "Jessica Shankleman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/V1LE0e_mBzxfSITNcVIZTA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/21e282e2f5f9ec6eac58266700cd8085", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
