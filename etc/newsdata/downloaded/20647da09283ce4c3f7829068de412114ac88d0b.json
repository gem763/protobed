They\u2019re right that some of the actors in these proceedings are politically motivated. But that\u2019s how it\u2019s meant to be. Congress is full of politicians,\u201d said Gregg Nunziata, an attorney and former counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee and Sen. Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioSenators ask Treasury to probe Brazilian meatpacker with major US footprint Lawmakers criticize gaming company for suspending player who supported Hong Kong protests Hillicon Valley: Senate Intel report urges action to prevent 2020 Russian meddling | Republicans warn Microsoft of 'urgent' Huawei threat | Court rules FBI surveillance violated Americans' rights MORE (R-Fla.).\n\nBut experts cast skepticism on the White House\u2019s latest salvo in the back-and-forth with Congress, viewing it as centered more on political arguments than sound legal ones and warning that it could present new risks in the ongoing impeachment fight.\n\n\n\nNunziata described the letter as \u201cvery confused as a legal matter,\u201d arguing that the White House counsel\u2019s office should be focused on asserting privilege and negotiating terms with lawmakers rather than shutting them down entirely at this point in the process.\n\n\u201cThis letter is baffling. There is no discernible legal strategy coming out of the White House,\u201d said Jonathan Turley, a legal scholar and Washington University law professor. \u201cIt\u2019s very important in impeachment to protect what I have called the spine of your case. You need to be consistent and coherent. This letter is neither, and the fact is that Congress has a legitimate right to pursue the Ukrainian evidence.\u201d\n\nTurley, who is a contributor to The Hill, particularly pointed to Trump\u2019s tweet Tuesday in which the president said he would \u201clove\u201d to allow a key State Department witness to testify before the House but didn\u2019t trust Democrats\u2019 \u201ckangaroo court,\u201d arguing it and the White House letter undermine Trump\u2019s primary defense \u2014 executive privilege \u2014 in withholding material related to diplomatic communications with Ukraine.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn the last 48 hours, they have made the position of the Democrats far stronger,\u201d Turley continued. \u201cIf the House does vote to formally begin an impeachment investigation, this letter may come back to haunt them.\u201d\n\nSome, like Turley, believe the White House raised legitimate concerns about the denial of due process and the lack of formal vote by the House on starting an impeachment inquiry despite past precedent. Others were less forgiving and described the arguments put forth by the White House as unsound.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental premise that the White House can decide if Congress\u2019s investigation is illegitimate just has no legal or constitutional basis,\u201d said Michael Conway, a former House Judiciary counsel during the Nixon impeachment.\n\nTo be sure, the letter poses a challenge for Democrats, essentially daring Pelosi to hold a floor vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry, which would establish the scope of the effort and other governing rules. The refusal by the executive branch to cooperate could also push Democrats taking their case to court to enforce subpoenas for documents and witness testimony, resulting in a protracted legal fight.\n\nTrump said Wednesday that he would consider cooperating with the impeachment inquiry if the House held a formal vote and \u201cif the rules are fair,\u201d leaving himself enough wiggle room to continue to stonewall Democrats if the procedures aren\u2019t to his liking.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is a scam, it\u2019s a fix,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cProbably ends up being a big Supreme Court case, goes a long time, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nOne former White House official said that, strategically, it was smart for the White House to use the letter to try to push Democrats to hold a formal vote on impeachment.\n\nPelosi has noted that there\u2019s no legal requirement for holding a formal vote, which poses its own political risks for both parties as it would force members to stake out a position on whether they support the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a number of Republicans say that an investigation would be merited and then have to walk that back. So, another part of [Trump\u2019s] strategy has been to keep his party in line. They\u2019re his firewall,\u201d said Todd Belt, director of the political management program at George Washington University.\n\nThe White House\u2019s defense strategy against impeachment has taken shape in recent days with the bolstering of his legal team, the refusal to cooperate with Democrats and the increasing effort to paint the inquiry as a partisan exercise designed to undo the will of voters in 2016.\n\nThe path forward must also contend with growing public support for an impeachment inquiry. A Washington Post\u2013Schar School poll released Tuesday showed a majority of Americans favor an impeachment inquiry, and a Politico\u2013Morning Consult poll released Wednesday morning showed half of registered voters support Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal from office.\n\nJay Sekulow Jay Alan SekulowTrump puts election-year politics at center of impeachment case Trey Gowdy joins Trump's legal team Trey Gowdy out at Fox News amid talks to join Trump defense team MORE, one of Trump\u2019s lead personal attorneys, has downplayed the need for a \u201cwar room\u201d by minimizing the impeachment investigation as a \u201cskirmish.\u201d\n\nStill, Trump\u2019s legal team is expected to add former Rep.

Gowdy brings with him a wealth of knowledge on the legal process as a former prosecutor, as well as familiarity with congressional proceedings from his time leading the House Oversight and Reform Committee and the House Select Committee on Benghazi.\n\n\u201cObviously Trey Gowdy has a history of being a champion of congressional authority when we had a Democrat in the White House, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how he squares some of those precedents with the position the White House is taking now,\u201d said Nunziata, the former GOP Senate counsel.\n\nSome have been underwhelmed by the dearth of a strategy from within the White House.\n\nOne former White House official said that, while the White House doesn\u2019t need to open a full-fledged impeachment war room, this would represent the ideal moment to fill the chief strategist role and let its occupant focus solely on countermessaging impeachment.\n\nNunziata questioned why the White House had gotten away from its strategy of at least limited cooperation during former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerFox News legal analyst says Trump call with Ukraine leader could be 'more serious' than what Mueller 'dragged up' Lewandowski says Mueller report was 'very clear' in proving 'there was no obstruction,' despite having 'never' read it Fox's Cavuto roasts Trump over criticism of network MORE\u2019s investigation.\n\n\u201cThey were able to claim in large part exoneration and make the case that Democrats had been overreaching on those allegations,\u201d Nunziata said. \u201cI think they should be doing the same thing here.\u201d", "description": "President Trump is leaning into a defense strategy marked by 2020 politics as he seeks to beat back a growing push by Democrats on impeachment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_100719getty_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
