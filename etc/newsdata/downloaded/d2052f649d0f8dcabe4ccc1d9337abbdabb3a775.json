You might know about the time he tried to slap a mustache on Mike Leach, or the time he walked off a plane looking like he\u2019d just stepped out of Studio 54, or the time he eluded both J.J. Watt and Whitney Mercilus in his very first NFL start.\n\nThe Minshew stories extend literally from one end of the country to the other, and if we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ve got years more to come. Here\u2019s a roundup of his earliest hits, courtesy of Woody Rogers, one of his coaches at Brandon (Miss.) High School, and Flint Minshew, aka Gardner Flint Minshew I, aka Gardner\u2019s daddy. These are the kind of stories best told on an aluminum high school bleacher bench on a Friday night, so crack open a cold one and enjoy.\n\nThe time Gardner was almost named \u2018Beowulf\u2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n(Paul Rosales/Yahoo Sports illustration)\n\nGardner was tapped for greatness even before birth. His grandfather, Flint\u2019s daddy, wanted to name him \u201cBeowulf,\u201d after the old English poem about a warrior who travels to the ends of the earth and beyond, often alone, to vanquish the world\u2019s most fearsome foes. Hell of a legacy to live up to.\n\n\u201cThat story\u2019s true,\u201d Flint says. \u201cHis grandfather wanted to name him that. But his grandfather didn\u2019t have to live with it every day. So it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nAs badass a name as \u201cBeowulf Minshew\u201d would have been, the family opted to name the boy, born May 22, 1996, Gardner Minshew II.\n\nWhy \u201cII\u201d and not \u201cJr.\u201d? \u201cIn Mississippi,\u201d Flint notes, \u201cIf you\u2019re a junior, you\u2019re going to be called \u2018Junior\u2019 or \u2018Bubba.\u2019 \u201d \u201cBeowulf Minshew\u201d didn\u2019t work, and neither would \u201cBubba Minshew,\u201d for entirely different reasons.\n\nThe time Gardner learned the art of the deke\n\nStory continues\n\nGardner grew up in Brandon, just outside Jackson, the most hypercompetitive and talented kid in a town full of them. Long before he committed to football, he ran the typical American youth sports gauntlet, and even in those early days, Flint could see the beginnings of an analytical sports mind.\n\n\u201cHe was playing basketball, couldn\u2019t have been more than 5 or 6,\u201d Flint recalls. \u201cHe goes driving to the basket on a fast break, and this kid comes up and blocks his shot. The next play, Gardner gets another breakaway. Same kid coming at him. This time, Gardner stops, the other kid goes flying off the court, Gardner\u2019s got an easy shot. He figured that out all on his own, on the court.\u201d\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be long before Gardner\u2019s church league team was pounding the Jesus out of every team they faced \u2014 once, by a score of 60-2. Dominance was to become something of a tradition for Gardner.\n\n\u201cHe loved playing basketball,\u201d Flint recalls, \u201cbut we were way too competitive. I never knew who was going to get kicked out first, me or him.\u201d\n\nGardner Minshew II and his father, Flint. (Courtesy of the Minshew family)\n\nThe time Gardner learned about dedication\n\nWith talent comes ego, but not necessarily drive. Gardner was good enough to be the star of every team, but not always the star of every league. One year in tee-ball, lil\u2019 Gardner found out that he hadn\u2019t been named to the league\u2019s All-Star team. He\u2019d learn to handle disappointment a little better in the future.\n\n\u201cI was out of town,\u201d Flint recalls, \u201cand he\u2019s stomping all over the house pissing and moaning that he didn\u2019t make the All-Star team. And his mother just chewed him out. \u2018You don\u2019t deserve to be an All-Star,\u2019 she told him. \u2018Every time Dad tried to get you to do something, you wanted to stay inside and play.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe cold truth woke up Gardner, flipped a switch somewhere inside him. \u201cHe decided it didn\u2019t matter what sport it was, baseball or soccer or whatever,\u201d Flint says. \u201cHe was going to be down at the park working, taking extra fly balls, taking extra shots on goal, whatever it was. Gardner always wanted to be that guy.\u201d\n\nYou can already see the Legend of Gardner building, can\u2019t you?\n\nThe time Gardner got a promotion\n\nBy the time he reached ninth grade, Gardner had settled on football as his sport of choice. He had the lineage; Flint was a star at Millsaps College, albeit on the defensive line. Gardner, on the other hand, always liked to be in a position of action on any field. In baseball, that meant catching. In soccer, goalie. And in football \u2026 well, you already know.\n\nFlint and Gardner had been running a version of the Air Raid offense since Gardner was in sixth grade. That playbook brought him to the attention of Wyatt Rogers, a coach who\u2019d learned the intricacies of Air Raid by studying aficionados like Mike Leach and Hal Mumme. The Minshews drove an hour each way to work with Rogers, and then, in a strange little twist, Rogers took a job at the very high school Minshew would be attending.\n\nGardner began ninth grade by quarterbacking the Brandon Bulldogs\u2019 JV team. But in the sixth game of the year, the varsity quarterback got injured, leaving the coaches no choice but to put in a 15-year-old kid.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t give up the ball for another three-and-a-half seasons.\n\n\u201cHe and I would stay after school every day throwing,\u201d Rogers recalls. \u201cHe would come in every morning at 7. His dad would drop him off at the office, and we\u2019d spend an hour watching football, some days our practice, some days colleges, anything football-related.\u201d\n\nSoon enough, the student had surpassed the master. \u201cIt got to a point where I had taught him everything I could teach him in Xs and Os,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cThen the roles reversed a little bit, and I\u2019d be asking him, what did you see? What do you think about this, Gardner?\u201d\n\nOver the course of 52 games, he\u2019d throw for 9,705 yards and 88 touchdowns to guys who are now drafting him for their fantasy teams.\n\n\u201cIt did not matter who was playing for him, the ultra-poor kids to the bankers\u2019 sons,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cThey all would get in line to follow Gardner Minshew.\u201d\n\n(Courtesy of the Minshew family)\n\nThe time Gardner\u2019s phone didn\u2019t ring\n\nBrandon is located within a Minshew throw of half a dozen football-mad schools; Ole Miss, Mississippi State, Alabama and LSU are all close by, and the pool spreads even wider when you step a notch down from the SEC. So it was quite the surprise to the Minshew family when Gardner didn\u2019t get a serious look from any of the big schools, or even any of the smaller schools. Flint suspects his son was one of many recruits getting strung along with promises, but no commitments.\n\n\u201cThese coaches play the system,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of dads call me with the same frustrations. I tell them the truth, in my opinion \u2014 when [coaches] tell you they\u2019re \u2018still evaluating,\u2019 that\u2019s bull. They\u2019re trying to get you for free as a walk-on if you don\u2019t have any other offers.\u201d\n\nGardner committed to a backup slot at Troy University, but opted to move to Northwest Mississippi Community College when a starting slot opened up. He threw for 3,228 yards and led NWCC to a junior college championship, and that put him on the radar of East Carolina University. A stretch of three games where he threw for over 350 yards in each only raised his profile further, and when he finished up at ECU, he made his availability known to the world.\n\n\u201cWhen he left ECU, he sent a release to everybody in the nation that lost a starting quarterback, to draft or graduation,\u201d Flint says. \u201cUSC, UCLA, Wazzu, LSU, Arkansas, Tennessee. We talked to a lot of people.\u201d But one particular conversation turned heads \u2026 and perceptions.\n\nGardner Minshew II became an instant fan favorite in his one season at Washington State. (Getty Images)\n\nThe time Gardner turned down Alabama\n\nBack in January 2018, Alabama was coming off an improbable national championship game victory over Georgia, pulled off when two different Bama quarterbacks rallied the team. Conventional wisdom was that Bama was now in a loser-leaves-town quarterback situation: Tua Tagovailoa and Jalen Hurts would compete for the starting job in the spring, and whoever didn\u2019t win it would transfer.\n\nNick Saban knew he\u2019d need a backup, and he had an eye on the kid from East Carolina. The only problem was, Hurts didn\u2019t end up transferring \u2014 not initially, anyway \u2014 which would have left Minshew buried so deep on the Alabama bench he wouldn\u2019t have seen daylight.\n\nStill, Saban\u2019s interest alone was enough to change the narrative around Gardner. \u201cWhen Saban likes you, everybody likes you,\u201d Flint laughs. \u201cEverybody loved Gardner after he got an Alabama offer. I was like, \u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been telling you.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was Washington State\u2019s Mike Leach who got through. Leach, reeling and in need of a quarterback after the tragic death of Tyler Hilinski, found a kindred Air Raid spirit in Minshew, and brought him to Pullman for one glorious season with a single, now-famous question:\n\n\u201cGardner, how would you like to come out to Washington State and lead the nation in passing?\u201d\n\nAt Washington State, Minshew faced an impossible situation \u2014 replacing Hilinski \u2014 with grace and tact. And the fans and students responded, embracing Minshew while he did, in fact, lead the nation in passing. Under Minshew, Washington State reached 11 wins for the first time, and Minshew himself led all FBS schools in yards per game with 367.6 yards. Minshew broke Jared Goff\u2019s single-season Pac-12 yardage record, and finished fifth in Heisman balloting.\n\nRogers recalls going to Pullman for one of those 11 victories, and he joined in the masses storming the field. \u201cI see this big crowd, cameras and boom mics,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Mississippi, there\u2019s about four or five people who can garner that kind of attention from the press. I\u2019m thinking, Holy [crap], Paris Hilton must have shown up. Then one of the football ops guys pulls me through, next thing I know there\u2019s Gardner in my face, and I\u2019m saying, \u2018You\u2019re the one they\u2019re following!\u2019 \u201d\n\nGardner Minshew has gone from sixth-round pick to Jaguars starter in a matter of months. (AP)\n\nThe time Gardner got into an NFL game\n\nSee if this sounds familiar: picked in the sixth round, 178th overall, by the Jaguars, Minshew didn\u2019t warrant much more than a glance from NFL analysts, especially not after the Jags kicked Blake Bortles to the curb and signed Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles. Minshew was the 10th quarterback picked, long after Kyler Murray and Daniel Jones and Dwayne Haskins, and the thinking was that he\u2019d hold a clipboard for a few years and then everyone would see what\u2019s what.\n\nAnd then Foles snapped his collarbone less than a quarter into the season, and Gardner Time was upon us at last. All Minshew did that first outing was complete the first 13 passes of his career and 22 of 25 overall. Sure, the Jaguars got waxed by the Chiefs, but that was going to happen anyway.\n\n\u201cEverybody asked if, when he went in, I was reflecting on everything that got us there and all that,\u201d Flint says. \u201cHell no. I was thinking, let\u2019s get a first down. Let\u2019s get down the field. Reflecting? Naw, man. There\u2019s a scoreboard up there.\u201d\n\nAfter the game, Gardner and Flint split a 38-ounce tomahawk steak and a pile of sides at the Cowford Chophouse not far from the stadium. They exhaled, looked at each other, and had the same reaction: \u201cThat was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nThe time Gardner got an \u2026 interesting sponsor offer\n\nFoles\u2019 injury meant that the Legend of Gardner Minshew had just grown two sizes. Week 2 brought a near-miracle \u2014 Minshew led the Jags to a possible game-winning drive against the Texans that fell inches short \u2014 and that sent Minshewmania into orbit.\n\nThe Burt Reynolds mustache had been Minshew\u2019s hallmark since Washington State. Then last week, a photo surfaced of Minshew looking like he\u2019d fallen through a portal from 1977, wearing a shirt unbuttoned to the waist. Wednesday brought an offer from an adult entertainment site: up to $1 million if he leads a class as part of an online, uh, \u201cfitness\u201d program taught by \u201cadult entertainment\u201d stars, or reps the company\u2019s \u201cknitted intimate apparel\u201d for Halloween. Really best not to ask where that intimate apparel goes.\n\n\u201cHa. That\u2019s good stuff,\u201d Flint said in a text to Yahoo Sports. \u201cAlways good to have options. What\u2019s the saying? \u2018The best time to find a job is when you have a job.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe time Gardner started a nationally televised NFL game\n\nThe outcome\u2019s yet to be determined, but it begins Thursday at 8:20 p.m. Eastern. (Watch it here.)\n\nGardner Minshew has hit obstacles \u2014 huge ones \u2014 at every turn of his career, and he\u2019s vaulted over all of them to reach the NFL. You\u2019d think that would put a chip on a guy\u2019s shoulder the size of a suitcase, but Flint says that\u2019s not so.\n\n\u201cFor Gardner, it\u2019s not about proving wrong the people who doubted him,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about proving right the people who believed in him. He\u2019s got a small circle, but it\u2019s a good circle.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been told no a hundred times more than he\u2019s been told yes,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cHe likes to bet on himself. He does not give a rip what other people think. If you tell him he can\u2019t do it, you sealed your fate.\u201d\n\nAnd the legend rolls on.\n\n____\n\nJay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
