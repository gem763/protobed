(plant, lettuce, tomato) trial at McDonald\u2019s Corp. has not been met with a resounding response and the end to the stock lockup.\n\nBeyond Meat BYND, -22.22% reported its first quarterly profit in the third quarter, and raised its 2019 guidance to revenue in the range of $265 million to $275 million, from $240 million.\n\nRead: Beyond Meat stock falls despite earnings that show first profit in company history\n\nOn the call, Chief Executive Ethan Brown talked up the food service partnerships Beyond Meat has entered into, particularly the ones with Subway, the largest restaurant chain in the world by the number of locations, KFC, a Yum Brands Inc. YUM, +0.19% chain, Dunkin\u2019 Brands Inc. DNKN, +0.95% , which just expanded the Beyond Breakfast Sausage sandwich to 9,000 locations, and McDonald\u2019s.\n\nBrown also talked about the McDonald\u2019s MCD, +0.44% trial as the next step in reaching a target for the company.\n\n\u201cThis important step reflects a dream becoming reality,\u201d he said, according to a FactSet transcript of the earnings call. \u201cWe\u2019ve long had our sights on ubiquitous availability for Beyond Meat, and years ago, I set a goal that my own children would be able to go to major fast food chains and order Beyond by the time they could drive.\u201d\n\nHe said Beyond Meat is now available in 53 countries around the world.\n\nHowever, as some analysts have already noted, just because McDonald\u2019s is trying Beyond Meat doesn\u2019t mean it will end up on the menu.\n\nSee: Beyond Meat\u2019s stock soars after McDonald\u2019s unveils test of company-made P.L.T. burgers\n\n\u201cA key question is whether McDonald\u2019s will partner with Beyond Meat in the U.S.,\u201d wrote Bernstein analysts in a note published Monday before the earnings were announced. They think a McDonald\u2019s partnership could add $168 million in fiscal 2019 and help boost sales to $867 million in fiscal 2021.\n\n\u201cBased on our channel checks with select McDonald\u2019s based in Ontario, Canada that are currently testing the Beyond P.L.T. burger, the initial feedback has been largely positive, although it seems that the trial has not been a blowout success thus far that justifies an immediate nationwide rollout across both Canada and the U.S.,\u201d Bernstein said.\n\nAnd: Beyond Meat initiated at sell as large competitors make gains in plant-based food\n\nAnd even if Beyond Meat is added to the menu, Bernstein analysts wonder whether the company can keep up with McDonald\u2019s.\n\n\u201cAt this rate of capacity expansion, we believe Beyond Meat will be able to keep up with demand growth at the current rate, although if the McDonald\u2019s partnership materializes, Beyond Meat may need to structure the deal such that its products are rolled out on a regional basis at least initially in order to maintain service levels,\u201d analysts wrote in a Tuesday note.\n\nBernstein rates Beyond Meat stock market perform and raised its price target to $106 from $100.\n\nSeth Goldman, Beyond Meat\u2019s executive chair, also addressed the end to the lockup.\n\n\u201cWhile we recognize short-term reactions to these milestones are often marked by heightened uncertainty, we believe that Beyond Meat is in a stronger position today than at any other time in its history,\u201d he said on the call.\n\n\u201cOur transition to a public company has positioned Beyond Meat well to be able to capitalize on the substantial growth opportunities that lie ahead of us, and we sincerely thank our pre-IPO investors for getting us to this point and for their long-term commitment and belief in our company.\u201d\n\nSensing those growth opportunities for their own companies, Tyson Foods Inc. TSN, +0.26% ,Kellogg Co. K, +2.96% and others have jumped into the plant-based meat category with their own brands.\n\n\u201cWe do not interpret the interests and efforts of large companies to capture our leadership position as evidence that they will do so, any more than Amazon\u2019s [ascent was] squelched by traditional retailers who entered e-commerce to unseat them,\u201d Brown said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: McDonald\u2019s expected to jump into chicken sandwich war next year: KeyBanc\n\n\u201cWe continue to view Beyond Meat as perhaps the best growth story in staples,\u201d wrote Jefferies analysts. \u201cHowever even with the recent pullback, Beyond\u2019s valuation at ~15.5X revenue sets a high bar for the stock, particularly with competition ramping up, topline momentum showing less upside versus loft Street expectations, and post-IPO lockup period expiring.\u201d\n\nJefferies rates Beyond Meat shares hold, and slashed its price target to $115 from $190.\n\nJPMorgan analysts also cut their price target, to $138 from $189, due to cuts in their revenue forecasts for 2025 and after. Analysts also question how many stockholders will sell their shares with the stock halved since its high point. The stock closed on July 26 at $234.90.\n\n\u201c[P]utting the lockup expiry in the past ultimately should incentivize some investors to start buying the stock again, though the shares could fade lower beforehand,\u201d JPMorgan wrote.\n\nJPMorgan rates Beyond Meat shares overweight.\n\nBeyond Meat stock is down 61% over the past three months while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.08% has gained 0.8% for the period.", "description": "Bernstein analysts conducted channel checks for feedback on the McDonald\u2019s trial of the Beyond Meat P.L.T. burger.", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU211_bynd_p_ZG_20191029110617.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
