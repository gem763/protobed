The contribution may reach 50% as soon as next year, with the bank working on two first-time offerings that may raise up to 3 billion yuan ($423 million), they said.\n\nUBS, one of two foreign ventures approved to sponsor initial public offerings on Shanghai\u2019s STAR Market, is betting that the high commissions from these issuances will partly offset a revenue decline in Hong Kong, where it has been banned from sponsoring IPOs till April. The Swiss bank is among those expanding in China after taking majority control of its local securities unit as the nation loosens restrictions on foreign participants in its $43 trillion financial industry.\n\n\u201cThe fees are lucrative,\u201d said Liu Wencheng, co-head of investment banking at UBS Securities. \u201cWe are actively mobilizing resources to dig and cultivate high quality tech-innovation companies to tap the opportunity.\u201d\n\nLiu wouldn\u2019t comment directly on the bank\u2019s plans for STAR Market.\n\nUBS is also focusing to the new bourse after mainland investment banking revenues, including fees from arranging debt sales, dropped 48% last year as the number of large deals shrank, according to the people familiar. In March, it was fined HK$375 million ($48 million) to settle cases brought by Hong Kong authorities and became the only foreign bank banned from sponsoring IPOs for 12 months.\n\nThe Swiss bank underwrote IPOs totaling $317 million in Hong Kong this year, compared with $1.6 billion in 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its tally on the mainland is about $98 million for 2019.\n\nA Hong Kong-based spokesman declined to comment on the details of UBS\u2019s China plans.\n\nThe STAR Market, launched in July, has been hailed as a testing ground for relaxed rules on listing and trading as policy makers seek to stem an exodus of new economy IPOs to Hong Kong and the U.S.\n\nFor investment banks, there\u2019s the carrot of higher fees. Underwriters typically charge issuers 1.5% to 2% fees for Hong Kong listings, compared with an average 7% on the tech board, according to the people. Also, unlike in Hong Kong, Chinese regulators have capped the number of banks involved to one if the issuer\u2019s IPO size is less than 10 billion yuan.\n\nSponsors on the tech board are required to co-invest in between 2% and 5% of the shares issued by their clients, an unusual arrangement that may limit foreign players\u2019 interest in leading deals due to their limited capital base onshore.\n\nTo shore up available capital, UBS is seeking special approval to use the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors program to co-invest in tech board IPOs, the people said.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Cathy Chan in Hong Kong at kchan14@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Candice Zachariahs at czachariahs2@bloomberg.net, Jun Luo\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- UBS Group AG, which runs the biggest foreign-controlled investment bank in China, is counting on the nation\u2019s new Nasdaq-style exchange to mitigate the impact of an underwriting ban in Hong Kong, according to people familiar with the matter.Beijing-based UBS Securities Co. aims to boost", "authors": ["Cathy Chan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
