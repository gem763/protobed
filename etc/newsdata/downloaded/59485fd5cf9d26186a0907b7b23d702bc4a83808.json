The Mystics and Sun don\u2019t play until the semifinals. The Sparks will play Sunday against the worst remaining seed.\n\nLas Vegas, which had clinched the franchise\u2019s first playoff berth since 2014 and first since moving to Nevada last year from San Antonio, earned a first-round bye and a home game with a victory over Phoenix on Sunday and a loss by Chicago.\n\n\u201cThe season kind of went how I expected it to. A lot of ups and downs, trying to understand each other and learn how to win,\u201d Aces coach Bill Laimbeer said. \u201cWe had our moments we looked very good, and moments where we looked really bad. All in all, to take the fourth seed and have a bye in the first round and a home game. We will take it.\u201d\n\nWhile the Aces have a bye, Chicago will have to play Wednesday against Phoenix. The Mercury are no stranger to the single-elimination postseason format, going 6-0 in it since the league changed to it in 2016. Chicago swept the three games during the regular season between the two teams.\n\n\u201cIn a one game knockout situation as long as we can limit what they want to do and make them feel uncomfortable anything is possible. We didn\u2019t win at Connecticut last year and we went in there and won,\u201d Phoenix coach Sandy Brondello said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in these situations before so we\u2019re not looking at it like \u201cOh we haven\u2019t won,\u201d because you just go and play. We\u2019re going to believe. We know we can do this. It\u2019s not easy, no game is easy. Anyone can beat anyone in this league so we just have to make sure that it\u2019s our night.\u201d\n\nMinnesota had a chance to get a home game, but a loss to Los Angeles on Sunday and a win by Seattle in Dallas gave the Storm the home matchup against the Lynx on Wednesday night in the opening round. Seattle won three of the four meetings between the teams this season, including the last three.\n\n\u201cWe know how to be good, and now we need to do that on the road. That\u2019s the hardest thing, and that\u2019s why the home games are so coveted,\u201d Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said. \u201cWe are going to see if we can win a hard road game. We need to play a lot better than we did today.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug Feinberg on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The WNBA's playoff bracket is set after a busy final day of the regular season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Feinebrg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/sky_sun_basketball_92852_c0-285-3600-2383_s1770x1032.jpg?414f8450757a195017a97821e6a2231663d1afb4", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
