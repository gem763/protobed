We have a majority for it, 30 was strong.'\n\nEven if Mr Johnson does decide to press for an early election there is no guarantee that he will succeed.\n\nUnder the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act he would need a 'super majority' of two-thirds of all MPs to call an election which would require Labour support.\n\nDominic Cummings is considered to be the driving force behind Mr Johnson's election plot\n\nMr Corbyn has said Labour is ready to go to the country once it is sure Mr Johnson cannot 'crash out' in a no-deal Brexit in the middle of a campaign.\n\nHowever there is widespread opposition among the party's MPs at a time when they are trailing in the polls.\n\nWhile there are other potential routes to an election, such as Tories voting for a no-confidence motion in their own Government which would only require a simple majority of one, they are also fraught with difficulties.\n\nAny decision is likely to wait until Friday when EU leaders are expected to make their decision on whether, and for how long, there should be another Brexit delay.\n\nIt is widely thought they will agree a so-called 'flextension' to the end of January, with the option for the UK to leave before then if there is agreement in Parliament on a deal before then.\n\nSuch a move would be in line with the request which Mr Johnson was forced to submit under the terms of the Benn Act after he failed to gain approval for his deal at Saturday's special sitting of Parliament.\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn speaking during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday\n\nThat approach enjoys the support of key figures such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish premier Leo Varadkar.\n\nHowever French President Emmanuel Macron is reported to be pressing for a much shorter delay to the middle of November to keep the pressure on MPs at Westminster.\n\nIf leaders cannot come to an agreement it could mean there will have to be an EU emergency summit, probably on Monday, just three days before the UK is currently due to leave.\n\nA shorter extension would be a boost to Mr Johnson who has told outgoing European Council president Donald Tusk that he does not want any further delay.", "description": "It is thought the Prime Minister will lay down the gauntlet to Jeremy Corbyn as soon as the EU grant another Brexit extension, a decision expected tomorrow.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/02/20111704-0-image-a-82_1571880104276.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
