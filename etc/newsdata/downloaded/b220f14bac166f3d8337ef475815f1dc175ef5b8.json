Yesterday we looked at the new \u201clunch shaming\u201d bill signed into law by California Governor Gavin Newsom. Students will no longer be given a basic lunch if they fail to pay for their meals and run up a large bill. This will supposedly prevent anyone from feeling singled out, while likely dumping additional costs on taxpayers.\n\nAt nearly the same time this was taking place, a different story was unfolding in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. The school district has been wrestling with a problem similar to the one being faced in California. They have thousands of dollars in unpaid lunch fees on the books and have been experimenting with ways to address that. For a time, they were giving students with more than ten dollars of lunch debt a tuna sandwich lunch. People complained about that, so they\u2019ve approved a new policy. The students will get a hot lunch, but none of the extra frills. And there are additional restrictions as well. (CBS Philadelphia)\n\nThe Cherry Hill Board of Education approved changes to the district\u2019s school lunch policy Tuesday. Students who fail to pay for lunch will now be allowed a hot lunch from the meal of the day menu, but no a la carte items\u2026 The new policy would also keep students who don\u2019t pay after repeated requests from extracurricular events. The reaction from those at the meeting was largely negative.\n\nThe reactions from parents may have been negative, but the reality is the same as it is in California. New Jersey also has a program in place to provide free lunches to students from economically disadvantaged families. Families with slightly higher incomes can also qualify for significantly lower price lunches. And the cost for this program is covered by a grant from the Department of Agriculture so it\u2019s not dumped on the local taxpayers.\n\nIf your income is high enough that you\u2019re nowhere near the poverty line, you\u2019re supposed to be taking care of your child\u2019s needs and that includes making sure they can take care of lunch when at school. Those in financial distress can request special accommodations.\n\nAnd the penalties aren\u2019t particularly severe under Cherry Hill\u2019s program. The tuna sandwich lunch, while nutritious, would definitely get stale after a while and it would be obvious that you were behind on your bills. But if the student is receiving the same hot meal as everyone else and just doing without the extra items, they\u2019re still getting a hot, nutritious meal. Missing out on dessert might prompt a conversation at home as to why they\u2019re not being given lunch money. Alternately, it might prompt the parents to ask where they lunch money they do give their child is actually going.\n\nAll of this strikes me as a challenge with obvious solutions available without just declaring that the school has to suck up the loss and figure out how to pay for endless free lunches. If your district wants lunch to be free, bring that up for a vote and build the money into the school budget. If not, take advantage of available programs to help pay for lunches for low-income families and communicate with the rest of the parents about why the bills aren\u2019t getting paid.", "description": "Eating, but not competing", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lunch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
