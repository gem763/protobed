He then multiplied the NIM impact by the average interest earning assets, which equals lost net interest income of about $4.45 billion. He says when you take the tax-effected amount of revenue there is an 11 per cent impact on profit.\n\nThe banks have hit back at this criticism of their exploitation of loyal customers. They claim they are working hard to offer all customers the best value proposition.\n\nBut Chanticleer has first-hand experience of how the exploitation works. Despite being a customer of Commonwealth Bank of Australia for more than 40 years, your rooster will not receive the best NetBank Saver rate of 1.5 per cent unless a request is made to roll over the deposit every three months. Without being proactive the rate will revert to 0.5 per cent.\n\nThe ACCC mortgage price inquiry said opaque discretionary pricing was a primary reason consumers failed to get better deals.\n\n\u2018\u2018Opaque discretionary pricing inflates borrowers\u2019 costs (including their time and effort) to discover better offers,\u2019\u2019 the ACCC said. \u2018\u2018This adversely impacts their willingness to shop around, either for a new residential mortgage or when they are contemplating switching their existing mortgage to another lender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018The unnecessarily high cost of price discovery is likely a key reason why 70 per cent of recent borrowers surveyed on behalf of an inquiry bank said they had obtained just one quote before taking out their residential mortgage.\n\n\u2018\u2018We consider that the big four banks profit from the suppression of borrower incentives to shop around and lack strong incentives to make prices more transparent.\u2019\u2019\n\nOne way to fix the front book/back book problem is to sell mortgage tracker products, which have a fixed margin over an official benchmark rate.\n\nA robust campaign in favour of these products by former securities regulator Greg Medcraft fell flat.\n\nComplacency abounds\n\nLaziness, inertia and lack of engagement in financial matters are not exclusive to the banking sector. Customers of insurance companies, telecommunications providers and energy retailers have been equally complacent.\n\nIt is common knowledge in the general insurance industry that loyal customers get the worst deal. Insurers regard them as people with a proven inability to shop around. That makes them ideal candidates for being hit with creeping increases in premiums.\n\nAs the premiums go up, the loyal customers are inundated with information about the discounts enjoyed for having multiple policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe energy and telecommunications sectors are fertile ground for case studies about the mistreatment of loyal customers and the front book/back book exploitation.\n\nIn the energy sector, it took government intervention to stop the energy retailers from taking advantage of loyal and complacent customers. Clients on fixed-term, market-based offers were often defaulted into much higher-priced \u2018\u2018standing offers\u2019\u2019 when their lower-priced offer expired. This gave the industry a bad name.\n\nIn telecommunications, mobile phone plans were bundled in a way that made it virtually impossible to compare prices between companies. Price discovery of the different components of a plan, including data allowances, was virtually impossible.\n\nOrigin chief executive Frank Calabria and Telstra chief executive Andy Penn are two senior executives who have been forced to confront the blatant exploitation of loyal customers.\n\nBrutal honesty\n\nAt The Australian Financial Review National Energy Summit this week, Calabria proudly called out how Origin had abided by the federal government\u2019s Default Market Offer. He said Origin abided by the law, which forces the implementation of lower prices, and took it a step further.\n\n\u2018\u2018We extended that default pricing towards customers on flat plans. So that really has meant that more than half a million of our customers are paying less for energy.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalabria was brutally honest at the summit when he said greater choice in consumer energy plans had resulted in greater complexity. This made it more difficult for people to navigate the market and industry practices.\n\nCompanies offered discounts priced off different base tariffs and confusing discounts, which made it difficult to be confident in choosing an energy provider.\n\n\u2018\u2018With a lack of consistency across the industry, it\u2019s easy to see why there has been low trust amongst customers,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn the energy sector it is difficult for companies to unilaterally provide lower-priced energy plans to customers because of the authorisation needed to change the price of direct debit bill payments.\n\nNot as simple as it looks\n\nIn the telco sector, customers have benefited from the decision by companies to offer all customers the best available data offers.\n\nTelstra\u2019s Penn confronted this issue last year with the removal of all excess data charges for new and existing customers. This was his way of dealing with the front book/back book challenge.\n\nTelstra explained it this way in its 2018 annual report: \u2018\u2018By choosing to lead the market and simplifying the charging model for our customers, we are likely to eliminate up to $500 million in revenues over the next three years, with excess data charges being the first example.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018However, over the longer term these changes are in the best interests of customers and will drive long-term value. They are expected to be more than offset by more services per customer and lower costs from simplicity and leadership shown by Telstra translating into new sources of growth.\u2019\u2019\n\nChris Petzoldt, the local managing director of consulting firm Simon-Kucher, says rewarding loyal customers is not as simple as it looks when seen through a purely commercial lens.\n\nHe says a customer who has been loyal for 15 years but spends very little with the company would be regarded as low value compared to a high-spending customer who had been with a company for only five years.\n\n''Tenure is not enough, you want the customer to be engaged with your products,\u2019\u2019 he says.\n\nPetzoldt said the idea of companies proactively offering all customers the best available terms was not as simple as it sounded.\n\nHe cited a study done by his firm in the telco sector in Europe. It found customers on pre-paid plans were spending far more than they would if they were on a post-paid plan. But many customers had deliberately chosen the higher-cost plan to limit the temptation of using too much data on a post-paid plan.\n\n\u2018\u2018There may be other causes or reasons why customers choose to buy a product that looks to be worse value than another,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPetzoldt said the worst thing a company could do was to make an offer to an existing customer that was not as good as offers made to new customers.", "description": "Laziness, inertia and lack of engagement in financial matters are not exclusive to the banking sector.
