This technology has also been used to doctor political videos, such as the clip that sounded, and looked like, Obama called President Trump a \u201cdipshit.\u201d\n\nTo combat this, the state of California passed two bills. The first now makes it illegal to post any manipulated videos of political figures, such as replacing a candidate\u2019s face with the intention to discredit them, within 60 days of an election. The second bill gives people living in California the right to sue anyone who puts their image into a pornographic video using deepfake technology.\n\nDeepfake tech has become easily accessible and videos can be made via apps or using affordable consumer-grade equipment, which is partly why the web is flooded with pornographic films of high-profile female celebrities. The erosive effects deepfakes could have on politics are also obvious \u2014 such as the doctored-footage of Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) sounding drunk, which Facebook refused to remove from the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cVoters have a right to know when video, audio, and images that they are being shown, to try to influence their vote in an upcoming election, have been manipulated and do not represent reality,\u201d Marc Berman, the California Assembly representative said in a press release, as first reported by Engadget. \u201c[That] makes deepfake technology a powerful and dangerous new tool in the arsenal of those who want to wage misinformation campaigns to confuse voters.\u201d\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union highlighted how this bill won\u2019t solve the issue of people weaponizing deepfake technology for political benefit. Instead, \u201cit will only result in voter confusion, malicious litigation and repression of free speech,\u201d the Union said in a letter.\n\nWhile we are yet to see any governing bodies or politicians\u2019 reputations being seriously destroyed by deepfakes, we have already witnessed tons of womens\u2019 likenesses superimposed in sexual or pornographic videos without their consent \u2014 whether they\u2019re celebrities or not.\n\nThese first steps made by the Californian government to combat malicious deepfake technology are promising, especially for those victims of revenge porn.\n\nRead next: US hospitals opt for paying hackers to survive Ryuk ransomware attack", "description": "To combat deepfakes, California passed two bills making it illegal to post any manipulated videos of political figures with the intent to discredit.", "authors": ["Cara Curtis"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2F200-calories-4-1.png&signature=4793b6b96afbf300362e53a2c963056f", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
