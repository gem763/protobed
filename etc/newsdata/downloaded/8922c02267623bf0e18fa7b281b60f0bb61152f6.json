And she's a married young woman. I didn't get married until I was 33 and I became a parent when I was 37. She's married at I think 23! Cute couple, great couple. Complicated!\"\n\nBaldwin, who's been married to singer Chynna Phillips since 1995, added, \"I always tell [Hailey], 'I'm in a showbiz marriage, and my wife was a very celebrated and successful recording artist like your husband.' Clearly not on the level of her husband,\" he explained. \"But I said, 'If you ever want to talk to me about the trials and tribulations and how to try to avoid the land mines, I've been with my wife for almost 30 years now.'\"\n\nJUSTIN BIEBER ADMITS HE WAS INTO 'HEAVY DRUGS,' STRUGGLED WITH FAME\n\nAnd land mines there are.\n\nIn March, Bieber, 24, admitted to Vogue that he had a \"legitimate problem with sex\" and that he and Hailey saved themselves for marriage.\n\nJUSTIN BIEBER PENS POEM TO 'SOULMATE' HAILEY BALDWIN: 'I THINK ABOUT YOU, GODS GREATEST CREATION'\n\n\u201cHe [God] doesn\u2019t ask us not to have sex for him because he wants rules and stuff,\u201d Bieber admitted. \u201cHe\u2019s like, 'I\u2019m trying to protect you from hurt and pain.' I think sex can cause a lot of pain. Sometimes people have sex because they don\u2019t feel good enough. Because they lack self-worth. Women do that, and guys do that.\"\n\n\u201cI wanted to rededicate myself to God in that way because I really felt it was better for the condition of my soul. And I believe that God blessed me with Hailey as a result. There are perks. You get rewarded for good behavior,\u201d Bieber added.\n\nThe singer said running into his now-wife in June made him realize how much he loved Baldwin despite their previous rough breakup.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw her last June, I just forgot how much I loved her and how much I missed her and how much of a positive impact she made on my life,\u201d Bieber recalled. \u201cI was like, 'Holy cow, this is what I\u2019ve been looking for.'\u201d\n\nJUSTIN BIEBER STEPPING AWAY FROM MUSIC TO FOCUS ON 'REPAIRING' SOME 'DEEP ROOTED ISSUES'\n\nJUSTIN BIEBER EXPLAINS WHY HE WAS CRYING WITH HAILEY BALDWIN\n\nFor her part, Hailey said, \u201cWe\u2019re really young, and that\u2019s a scary aspect. We\u2019re going to change a lot. But we\u2019re committed to growing together and supporting each other in those changes,\u201d the model said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I look at it. At the end of the day, too, he\u2019s my best friend. I never get sick of him.\u201d\n\nBaldwin previously confessed he'd wished his niece waited a bit longer to marry the \"Sorry\" singer.\n\n\u201cI love them as a couple and I would\u2019ve loved to see them get married if they waited a couple more years,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cMaybe that would have been better, but they didn\u2019t want to wait because they\u2019re both devout in their faith and \u2026 that wasn\u2019t the right fit for them so that\u2019s really none of my business.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBieber and Hailey are set to have a wedding ceremony and reception for family and friends \u2014 over a year after legally tying the knot \u2014 this month.", "description": "Hailey and Justin Bieber are adorable, if complex, her uncle Billy Baldwin claims.", "authors": ["Jessica Sager"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/justin-bieber-hailey-bieber-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
