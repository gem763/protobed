As a staff full of gamers and game-lovers, we'll be serving up extra reviews, guides, interviews, and other stories all about gaming from August 19 to August 23.\n\nMost people can meet their gaming audio needs with a good pair of headphones. But if you play lots of multiplayer games or frequently use your console/rig to chat with friends, a good gaming headset and its included microphone will make more sense. Unfortunately, the market for gaming headsets remains riddled with junky hardware.\n\nSo for Ars Gaming Week, we're getting you some help. We spent the last three months testing 30 gaming headsets to find the ones most worth buying. Below you can find our current favorites, including options for those on a budget, those with cash to burn, and those who want to go wireless. And, like with all of our Guidemasters, you can consider this a living guide\u2014we\u2019ll be sure to update it as new standouts arrive.\n\nOne last note: like most audio-related buying guides, there are personal biases at play when talking headsets. Different people have different sound preferences, and that\u2019s fine. I can only speak to what I like, and as someone who\u2019s used hundreds of headphones over the years as a tech reporter, I like to think my opinions can be of use. All of this is to say that, as with most audio reviews, nobody can tell you what you like, and it\u2019s best to treat this guide as part of a wider consensus that helps you find the products that are worth it.\n\nThat said, we're confident the following headsets will suit most people well.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe best gaming headset for most people: Cooler Master MH751\n\nJeff Dunn\n\nJeff Dunn\n\nJeff Dunn\n\nJeff Dunn\n\nJeff Dunn\n\nMost people in the market for a gaming headset should buy the Cooler Master MH751. For less than $100, it provides exceptional value in comfort and audio quality, with a good microphone and a relatively handsome design to boot. It\u2019s a no-frills headset with few special features, but it nails the fundamentals so well that most people in the market for a gaming headset are unlikely to care.\n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting to like the MH751 as much as I did considering how little cachet Cooler Master has in the audio world. There\u2019s a secret to the company\u2019s success here, though: the MH751 and its pricier sibling, the MH752, are rebadged versions of Chinese OEM Takstar\u2019s Pro 82 headphones, which are something of a cult favorite among audio enthusiasts. They\u2019re not exactly the same thing\u2014the bass adjustment slider on the Pro 82 is gone, and the Cooler Master headsets use a 3.5mm jack instead of the more obtuse 2.5mm port\u2014but the meat of the design is very similar. What changes Cooler Master did make are generally for the better, including a tidier sound and a nicer-feeling pseudo-sanded material on the ear cups.\n\nThe key selling point here is comfort. A gaming headset is something you\u2019re likely to wear for hours at a time whenever you use it, so whatever you buy needs to play nice with your head. Because everyone\u2019s head is different, comfort is subjective, but the MH751 is as close as I can get to guaranteeing something will feel pleasant around your ears. It was easily the most comfortable of the 30 gaming headsets I tested, and it ranks among the most agreeable headphones I\u2019ve ever worn as a whole. Again, the secret here is shameless copying: the Takstar Pro 82 more or less rips off the design of Sony\u2019s MDR-1A, which I am on the record as calling the nicest-feeling headphones I\u2019ve ever used.\n\nThe MH751 can\u2019t quite reach those heights, but its leatherette ear pads have ample amounts of soft memory foam padding and plenty of space to fit the whole of your ears. They rest gently against your temple instead of clamping down too tight. While the headband doesn\u2019t have as much padding, there\u2019s enough to present no problems. The design feels good and light because it balances its weight so evenly. Adjusting the headband is smooth, with light clicks to indicate your calibrations, and there is a generous amount of room to make those adjustments. The result of all this is a headphone that should fit even the largest heads with aplomb and remain pleasing to wear for multi-hour play sessions. (Your ears may get a little sweaty over time, but that\u2019ll happen with almost any over-ear headphone.) To be clear, when I say \u201ceven the largest heads,\u201d I\u2019m talking about myself. When I get this enthusiastic over a headphone\u2019s feel, it should give you particular reassurance.\n\nThat comfort wouldn\u2019t mean much if the MH751\u2019s sound was subpar, but that\u2019s very much not the case. The operative words here are neutrality and balance. No one part of this sound signature dominates the other: bass is present and well-measured but not boosted, mids are realistic and detailed, highs are clean and not fatiguing unless you dial the volume up to dangerous levels. The soundstage is wide enough for a closed-back headphone, and imaging is strong, so you\u2019ll be able to pick out enemy footsteps in a first-person shooter and the like. It\u2019s not a flat sound profile, but it\u2019s decidedly flatter than most gaming headsets. You mostly hear things as they were mixed to sound. If anything, some people may wish it was less balanced in the low-end, since bumped-up bass can give explosions and other action game sound effects more impact. There\u2019s also no virtual surround sound support\u2014there is in the MH752\u2014but that has never made or broke the quality of a gaming headset, since that tech is largely dependent on what game you\u2019re playing. The components and tuning of the MH751 is good enough to outclass the sound of many pricier headsets that do include 7.1 surround.\n\nI don\u2019t want to overstate things: this is still a sub-$100 headphone, and you can get more detail and crisper treble on slightly more expensive headphones. But compared to most gaming headsets, even ones closer to $200, the MH751 hits what it\u2019s going for and gives little to complain about.\n\nSimilarly, the MH751\u2019s microphone punches above its price range. It gives voices a good sense of fullness and clarity, and it does a good job of suppressing outside noise\u2014not the best, but good. You can hear a sample of me using it below. (And yes, I thought the idea of reading Dickens in a post about gaming headsets would be funny.) The mic is flexible enough and totally detachable, and it locks tightly into place when it is connected.\n\nOn top of all of this, the MH751 doesn\u2019t look like a gaming headset, which is one of the biggest compliments I can give any gaming headset. There\u2019s no gaudy RGB lighting and the Cooler Master logo on the side doesn\u2019t look like something a bunch of guys in a board room thought would appeal to energy-drink-swilling \u201cgamers.\u201d While the all-black finish isn\u2019t the most exciting thing in the world, and there\u2019s too much plastic to say the headset feels out-and-out premium, in no way does the MH751 feel flimsy or creaky. It\u2019s very much something you can wear outside without getting looks. The braided cable is a bit long and places the volume/mic mute controls slightly too far down, but like the mic it\u2019s removable, so you can always swap in a more travel-friendly cord if it bothers you. Isolation is just OK, though, so you might still hear louder noises if you\u2019re playing with the volume at a low level. The ear cups don\u2019t fold up, either. Still, this is light and handsome enough to work as a good mobile headphone.\n\nAll of this means the MH751 isn\u2019t just good for a gaming headset\u2014it\u2019s a legitimately strong pair of headphones with a quality mic. It\u2019s great for gaming, great for audio enthusiasts on a budget, and great value.\n\n(Note: the MH751 normally retails for $80, but it became low in stock online in the days before this guide was published. A Cooler Master representative told me the shortage is only temporary, so it should be wildly available again in the near future, but as of this writing its price has fluctuated a bit. In the meantime, we've linked to the Cooler Master MH752, which is nearly identical to the MH751 but includes 7.1 virtual surround sound support and a USB sound card. If you can find the MH751 at its normal price, we recommend that, but since the MH752 is currently going for a few bucks less, it's temporarily the better buy.)\n\nThe good\n\nExceptional comfort, balanced sound, and understated design at an affordable price.\n\nThe bad\n\nDesign could feel more premium and ear cups don\u2019t fold up.\n\nCooler Master MH752 $90.99 from Amazon (Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs .)\n\nOn a budget: Kingston HyperX Cloud Stinger\n\nValentina Palladino\n\nValentina Palladino\n\nValentina Palladino\n\nThe MH751 is sometimes available in the $60-70 range\u2014at that price, it\u2019s worth the premium over any budget headset. If you\u2019re determined to spend no more than $50, though, the HyperX Cloud Stinger should serve you well. It\u2019s a downgrade from the MH751 in almost every way, but its energetic sound and relatively comfortable design make it a good buy for those on the cheap.\n\nThe Cloud Stinger has what\u2019s known as a \u201cV-shaped\u201d sound signature: it boosts the low- and high-end frequencies at the expense of a more recessed mid-range. The bass is particularly hyped-up, but all that added thump feels more fun than overblown in practice. The highs are present to the point of fatigue at the highest volumes, but they\u2019re neither overly dulled nor sibilant. Imaging is excellent as well, and distortion is low. All of this makes for a sound that isn\u2019t balanced or natural for music, but it works well for gaming: the powerful low-end gives explosions and shotgun blasts more oomph, the bump in the treble and high-mids makes enemy footsteps more prominent, and all of it puts sounds where they\u2019re supposed to be. The laid-back mids do make you miss out on some finer details, but for the price and the point of the headset, it sounds good.\n\nSimilarly, the Cloud Stinger\u2019s microphone isn\u2019t top-notch but performs well for a $50 headset. It does well to keep voices audible within background noise. Speech is consistently clear, though it lacks some airiness and sparkle in the treble and makes voices sound slightly duller then they\u2019d sound on better mics as a result.\n\nThe design here has its ups and downs. On the plus side, it\u2019s comfortable, with spacious ear cups, a highly adjustable headband, and a good amount of memory foam padding on both. It\u2019s a bit stiffer on the ears than the MH751, but so are most headsets. What\u2019s here isn\u2019t outright stiff at all and it\u2019s lightweight. The Cloud Stinger is a few years old at this point, but this design is still more pleasant to wear than many headsets that cost twice as much.\n\nThat said, the plastic-heavy exterior feels like a $50 headset. The ear cups don\u2019t fold up. The microphone isn\u2019t all that flexible. It leaks noise at higher volumes, and it\u2019s mediocre at isolating external noises. And both the mic and the 3.5mm cable are permanently attached. Combine all that with the big red HyperX logo on the sides, and you have a headset that\u2019ll look very goofy outside of the house. (HyperX announced new PS4- and Xbox-themed versions of the headset shortly before this guide was published, but a HyperX rep says the new models have the same technical specs as the existing pair.) Still, if you\u2019re specifically in the market for an affordable gaming headset, these shouldn\u2019t be dealbreakers. For the money, the Cloud Stinger is a fun time where it matters the most.\n\nThe good\n\nFun sound and plenty of comfort for $50.\n\nThe bad\n\nNon-detachable microphone and cable.", "description": "We tested 30 gaming headsets over several months to find the pairs worth buying.", "authors": ["Jeff Dunn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/headsets_hero2-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-21"}
