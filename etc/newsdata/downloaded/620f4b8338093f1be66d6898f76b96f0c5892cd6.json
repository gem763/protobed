Sentencing arguments will begin Sept. 17 to determine how much time Ghazi must serve behind bars before he is eligible for parole.\n\nBaby died of stab wounds sustained in utero\n\nIn an agreed statement of facts presented by prosecutors Thursday, court heard that at the time of the attack, Ghazi and his wife had been married 12 years.\n\nGhazi admitted that he abused hard drugs. He was under a court order that forbade him from taking drugs, drinking, communicating with his wife without her consent and being at their apartment without her consent.\n\nOn July 23, 2017, he showed up to their apartment. His wife asked him to leave, suspecting he had taken drugs.\n\nHe refused to go so she called 911. He got angry and left before police arrived.\n\nJustice Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Buffoni asked Ghazi a series of questions Thursday, including whether he was pleading guilty voluntarily. Through tears in the prisoner\u2019s box, he answered 'Yes.' (MHP)\n\nBut in the early morning hours of July 24, he returned and stabbed his wife, who was 33 at the time, with a carving fork.\n\nShe had 19 wounds, mainly in her stomach area but also to her left thigh.\n\nShe was taken to hospital, and the baby, known to the court only as \"Baby Ghazi,\" was born via caesarean section but died shortly after.\n\nIt was later determined the baby died as a result of the wounds inflicted on the mother.\n\nWife expected to make statement during sentencing\n\nHis wife was among those slated to testify during the trial, along with police investigators, crime scene technicians and paramedics.\n\nShe is now expected to make a statement during the sentencing arguments.\n\nProsecutor Chantal Michaud said the Crown is satisfied with the day's events, and that her thoughts are with the woman and her two children, a four-year-old girl and a seven-year-old boy.\n\n\"We hope that what happened today will help her turn the page and live a life that is as normal as possible,\" Michaud said.\n\nShe wouldn't answer specific questions about the plea or the next steps in the case, saying she is saving that information for the sentencing hearing.\n\nGhazi's lawyers did not comment.", "description": "Sofiane Ghazi, 39, pleaded guilty Thursday to second degree-murder in connection with the stabbing of his pregnant wife that resulted in the death of their baby.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4221305.1520621668!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/sofiane-ghazi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
