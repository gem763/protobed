But it lost about $900m in the first six months of this year.\n\nAs the numbers have grown bigger, so has the scrutiny from investors who have questioned the links between Mr Neumann's personal finances and WeWork.\n\nThey also worried about his judgement, amid complaints about his hard-partying ways.\n\nBut Mr Neumann's fate sealed after plans for a public share offering were shelved last month.\n\nShortly afterwards, Mr Neumann announced he would take a step back from the firm, saying scrutiny of his leadership had \"become a significant distraction\".\n\nFormer Uber boss Travis Kalanick:\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDuring his time at Uber, Travis Kalanick presided over a rampant culture of sexism, the covering up of a major hack, spying on journalists and, allegedly, the theft of trade secrets from Google.\n\nMr Kalanick became known for his aggressive business tactics. When New York Mayor Bill De Blasio threatened to limit the number of rideshare drivers allowed to work in the city, Uber added \"De Blasio's Uber\" feature, which showed no available cars or long waits for a ride.\n\nWhen the city of Austin introduced a bill that Uber didn't like, the firm switched off services in the city.\n\nIn a widely reported email to staff ahead of a company party in Miami in 2013, Mr Kalanick - known as TK - asked employees not to have sex with each other if they were in the \"same chain of command\" or to throw beer kegs off tall buildings, and levied a $200 (\u00a3158) \"puke charge\" for anyone who was sick, presumably as a result of over-indulgence.\n\nEventually, in 2017, following a spate of apologies from Mr Kalanick for both his own behaviour and that of members of his leadership team, he resigned.\n\nLike Mr Neumann, he also sold down his stake in the firm he founded to Softbank.\n\nMs Fongang describes people like Mr Kalanick as \"honest and direct\".\n\n\"They say what they think,\" she says.\n\nBut she says things go wrong when their actions don't match their words.\n\nTheranos founder Elizabeth Holmes:\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nElizabeth Holmes also dropped out of college to work on the business venture that made her a billionaire.\n\nThe difference between her and Mr Neumann or Mr Kalanick is that the implosion of Ms Holmes' business, Theranos, has left her facing prison time.\n\nShe founded the firm on an idea for a drug-delivery patch that could adjust dosage to suit an individual patient's blood type and then update doctors wirelessly.\n\nThe patch never made it to market, but the big idea - the one upon which the whole hoopla of Theranos was built - was a machine that could test for a variety of diseases through only a few drops of blood from a person's finger.\n\nThere was just one problem: it didn't work.\n\nA story in the Wall Street Journal in 2015, accusing the firm of not using its own machines to test blood samples, prompted an investigation by the US financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nWithin a year, Theranos had its licences revoked and began shutting down its labs.\n\nForbes magazine revised Ms Holmes' wealth down from $4.5bn to \"nothing\".\n\nWhen should they go?\n\nMs Fongang says a boss should quit or be booted out when staff and investors lose faith in their ability to deliver on their vision.\n\n\"Not all start-up entrepreneurs are meant to be leaders,\" she says.\n\nSome are great visionaries, while others are great inventors, she says. \"They should stick to that.\"", "description": "They say it's lonely at the top, but as WeWork's ex-leader recently learned, it's also precarious.", "authors": ["Dan Ascher", "Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9BF4/production/_109342993_kalanick_holmes_neumann_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
