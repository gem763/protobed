We\u2019re paraphrasing, but that seems to be the Disney+ business strategy before its launch on November 12, and it\u2019s right out of the Sanderson Sisters\u2019 spell book. In the streaming service\u2019s latest conjure from days of yore, Disney is planning to beckon millennials into its lair with a long-awaited sequel to the 1993 unlikely Halloween classic Hocus Pocus.\n\nAccording to Collider, Disney+ has hired Workaholics writer and co-producer Jen D\u2019Angelo to pen the script for Hocus Pocus 2. Who couldst hath foretold such a development? In the decades since the original film\u2019s premiere, it has become all but enshrined as a holiday staple, thanks in large part to its airings on Disney Channel and Freeform in October. No director is pegged to the project yet. Although High School Musical director Kenny Ortega helmed the original film, he notably signed an exclusive development deal with Netflix earlier this year.\n\nAs for the cast, when Hocus Pocus reboot rumors were brewing back in 2017, Deadline reported that the original Sanderson trio of Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy wouldn\u2019t be returning. Those rumors were surrounding a Disney Channel remake, however. Now that it\u2019s a sequel, maybe the original Sandersons will return, after all. Jen D\u2019Angelo also co-starred with Nicole Byer on Loosely Exactly Nicole, and now that we think about it, Byer would make a phenomenal Winifred. And might we humbly suggest Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as cursed catboy Thackery Binx?\n\nEither way, congrats, virgins!", "description": "Upcoming Disney streaming service Disney+ is producing a sequel to the Halloween classic \u201cHocus Pocus.\u201d The original starred Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy.
