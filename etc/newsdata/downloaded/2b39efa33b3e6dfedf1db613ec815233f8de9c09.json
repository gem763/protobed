Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) took her 2020 campaign for the Democrat presidential nomination to Chicago on Tuesday, where she joined striking members of the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) on the picket lines.\n\nWarren said in a speech delivered to a crowd of teachers gathered on the picket lines in West Chicago:\n\nI\u2019m here to stand for America\u2019s public schools. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago\u2019s teachers. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago nurses. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago\u2019s librarians. I\u2019m here to stand with Chicago\u2019s bus drivers. I\u2019m here to stand with the low wage workers in the Chicago schools. I also am here to stand with our unions. To stand with SEIU, to stand with CTU, and here\u2019s why\u2013because the unions are how we have a voice. The unions are how we have power.\n\n\u201cThe unions are how we make sure that the needs of every one of our children are heard loud and clear,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reported Warren\u2019s appearance came \u201chours after union President Jesse Sharkey accused Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration of \u2018vindictive actions\u2019 for suggesting the union go back to work without a contract and saying there was no more money for teacher demands.\u201d\n\nThe strike began on Thursday morning, and Tuesday is the fourth day that classes have been cancelled for the 361,000 students who attend the Chicago Public Schools.\n\nIn her speech, Warren made no mention of the dismal academic performance of those students when compared to the national average, or the role the striking teachers have in failing to improve that performance.\n\nEarlier in her speech, Warren said, \u201ceveryone in America should support you in this strike. And the reason is because when you go out and fight, you don\u2019t just fight for yourselves, you fight for the children of this city, and the children of this country,\u201d adding:\n\nI believe in public education, and I believe it is time in America to make a new investment in public education. And I got a plan for that. America\u2019s public schools need a partner in Washington.Not a partner who\u2019s going to tell them what to do. Not a partner who\u2019s going to do high stakes testing. Not a partner who\u2019s going to pinch pennies. But a partner who\u2019s going to be there, to back you up in the critically important work you do every day. And for me, that start\u2019s with an $800 billion investment in our public schools. It starts with quadrupling our funding for title one schools. Let\u2019s level the playing field. It starts with full funding for IDEA for all of our children who are in special education. And it starts with a grant to every single public school in this country so that that public school can decide how to spend the money that it needs to provide the first rate education for the children it has.\n\nCTU President Jesse Sharkey made it clear on Tuesday he intends to play hard ball with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to get more money for the 25,000 teachers in his union, as The Tribune reported:\n\nIn an email sent [to the Tribune] after midnight, Sharkey said, \u201cOur bargaining team was beginning to see glimmers of progress on issues that matter to our members. (Monday) that progress stopped dead. \u201cIt was clear from the mayor\u2019s letter to the press demanding members go back to work without a contract and from the sudden atmosphere of stonewalling from the CPS team, that (Lightfoot) had pulled the plug on negotiations,\u201d Sharkey continued. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s team said that there was no more money in the budget to address the many outstanding demands that are necessary to deliver justice for our school communities,\u201d he said.\n\nTuesday\u2019s rally was kicked off by Brandon Johnson, who declared he is \u201ca proud member of the Chicago Teachers Union. I am also proud to be the Cook County Commissioner of the First District.\u201d\n\nJohnson said:\n\nThis moment has been brought to you by the largest political resistance that we\u2019ve seen in a generation. For those that have taken us for granted for the last 35 years, the Chicago Teachers Union and SEIU we\u2019re saying enough is enough. We\u2019re not going to turn back now.\n\n\u201cWe are going to secure economic justice today,\u201d he added,\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the national union with which the CTU is affiliated, also addressed the crowd:\n\nI feel like I have been in Chicago so much the last few weeks that I probably have to start paying property taxes. It shouldn\u2019t have taken, as [CTU President] Jesse [Sharkey] said, to the brink of a strike in order to have real negotiations. There were more negotiations in the first two days of the strike than in the last ten months, that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with this bargaining process.\n\nYou can see Warren\u2019s full remarks here, in this YouTube video posted by the American Federation of Teachers:", "description": "Sen.
