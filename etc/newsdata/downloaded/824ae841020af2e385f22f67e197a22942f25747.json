But because Dershowitz has claimed that Boies and his firm are attempting to commit extortion by making sexual misconduct allegations connected to Epstein, U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska ruled that Boies and his associates could be witnesses in the case, and cannot be both litigators and participants in the same trial.\n\nVirginia Roberts Giuffre has said she met Epstein in Florida as a 16-year-old, was sexually abused by him and others in his orbit, and escaped him in 2002. Epstein was subsequently convicted of solicitation charges in 2008, while represented by Dershowitz. Epstein was charged with federal sex trafficking counts in July and committed suicide in August in jail.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeginning in late 2014, Giuffre began publicly accusing Dershowitz of having sex with her on numerous occasions at various Epstein properties. Dershowitz promptly and publicly responded that Giuffre was a liar. After Dershowitz\u2019s first denials, lawyers in Boies\u2019s firm reached out to Dershowitz to help represent him, and they exchanged emails and documents before the Boies lawyers learned that Boies had already agreed to represent Giuffre.\n\nBoies met several times with Dershowitz in 2015 to discuss the allegations. Dershowitz claimed Boies acknowledged Giuffre was wrong but continued to represent her. Boies responded that he still believed Giuffre.\n\nWhen Giuffre repeated her allegations in 2018, Dershowitz again denied them, again called Giuffre a \u201ccertified, complete, total liar,\u201d and again raised his belief that Giuffre and Boies were attempting to extort money from Leslie Wexner, founder of The Limited and Victoria\u2019s Secret clothing chains, by threatening similar public allegations. Dershowitz also played recordings for reporters of a 2015 conversation he had with Boies in which Boies reportedly acknowledged that Dershowitz did not have sex with Giuffre.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn April of this year, Giuffre sued Dershowitz for defamation, with Boies as her lawyer. She, and Boies, previously sued Epstein\u2019s close associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, for defamation after Maxwell denied Giuffre\u2019s allegations, and Maxwell settled with Giuffre in 2017.\n\nBecause Epstein\u2019s death ended his criminal case, Giuffre\u2019s defamation action against Dershowitz could be one of the dwindling number of cases allowing a full airing of accusations against Epstein.The lawsuit could also expose new details about Wexner\u2019s alleged involvement in, and knowledge of, Epstein\u2019s escapades. Wexner has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nOne of the defamatory statements alleged in Giuffre\u2019s complaint is that she conspired with her attorneys to extort Wexner. For a statement to be defamatory, it must be provably true or false. In a hearing last month, Dershowitz told the court he plans to explore the underlying facts and prove the extortion scheme occurred.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe now are free to use Boies as a witness,\u201d Dershowitz said Wednesday, \u201cuse his partners as witnesses, to subpoena the material to prove that this was all a frame-up. This is a woman that told everybody for years that she did not have sex with me. Suddenly, the day she meets David Boies, she changes her story.\u201d\n\nGiuffre and Boies\u2019s law firm noted that Dershowitz\u2019s attempt to have Giuffre\u2019s suit thrown out had failed. Dershowitz argued that his statements in 2018 and 2019 were merely repeats of his statements in 2015, which were beyond the statute of limitations.\n\nThe federal judge who sits in the Southern District of New York said Dershowitz\u2019s new statements created new causes of action. \u201cDershowitz went looking for trouble,\u201d Preska wrote, \u201cand by his repeated affirmative republications, he found it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSigrid McCawley, one of Boies\u2019s partners who has worked closely with Giuffre since 2015, said the case moving forward means Dershowitz \u201cwill have to face justice.\u201d She said Preska\u2019s decision to disqualify the firm \u201cis deeply disappointing and it will be promptly appealed.\u201d\n\nGiuffre said in a statement that she was \u201cgrateful for the court\u2019s decision to deny Alan Dershowitz\u2019s shameful attempt to dismiss my defamation case against him. I will no longer be silenced.\u201d She said McCawley and Boies \u201cstood up to the muscle of the Epstein machine and its grip on the legal system\u201d and the firm\u2019s disqualification was Dershowitz \u201cattempting to manipulate the legal system in the face of the serious charges I have brought against him.\u201d\n\nThe judge noted that Giuffre, and her lawyers, said they would try to prove that Boies and his firm did not participate in an extortion scheme of Wexner or of rendering Dershowitz\u2019s statements false. Dershowitz would try to prove there was such a scheme. \u201cThus, it is plain,\u201d Preska wrote, \u201cthat several of the [Boies] firm\u2019s lawyers will be essential trial witnesses on a major claim in the complaint.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTied to the lawsuit is a trove of documents from past litigation, particularly the Giuffre v. Maxwell case, of which thousands were unsealed the day before Epstein committed suicide. The earlier case has been reassigned to Preska as well. Dershowitz has been seeking to have the documents unsealed, saying it would support his claims that Giuffre has been untruthful.\n\nAttorneys revealed during a conference last month that the remaining papers include 29 depositions and hundreds of documents containing thousands of names not publicly known; many of those individuals are implicated in Epstein\u2019s conduct, the attorneys said.\n\nAD", "description": "Boies represents a Jeffrey Epstein victim who claimed Dershowitz had sex with her.", "authors": ["Tom Jackman", "Reporter Covering Criminal Justice Locally", "Deanna Paul", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oCjo2mMEwjVfKsWCy3nK3j1IMI4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I4MBMAWI7QI6TIP6ZJDORVLTYA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
