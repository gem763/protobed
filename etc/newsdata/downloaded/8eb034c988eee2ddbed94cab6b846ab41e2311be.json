According to LPL Financial, since 1950 the S&P 500 has experienced more 1% or larger swings in October than any other month.\n\n\u201cWe believe high October volatility is more than just a coincidence. We believe it is a critical period for many investors and companies that manage performance to calendar year-end,\u201d Goldman Sachs equity derivatives strategist John Marshall wrote in a note to clients.\n\nWith this in mind, we wanted to find the most compelling investments given possible volatility next month. Using the TipRanks Stock Screener, we filtered our search results by sector specifically looking for consumer staples stocks. These stocks often hold up well during times of extreme market volatility as people still need to buy the essentials regardless of the economic landscape.\n\nHere are the 3 consumer staples stocks to buy for October.\n\nPost Holdings Inc.\n\nPost Holdings (POST- Get Report) is the third-largest cereal maker in the U.S. with its brands including Honey Bunches of Oats, Fruity Pebbles and Bran Flakes. While shares have dipped 3% in the last five days, POST has been steadily gaining traction as shares are up 18% year-to-date.\n\nAnalysts point to its active nutrition spinoff, which was originally announced last November, as reinforcing its strong long-term growth narrative. On September 20, POST filed the IPO registration for the nutrition segment of its business. The spinoff, which will be called \u201cBellRing Brands Inc.\u201d, includes its Premier Protein, Dymatize, PowerBar, Supreme Protein and Joint Juice brands.\n\n\u201cWe think it will be well received and is quite a value creator in that Post today trades at 10.2x EBITDA but Premier Nutrition will likely be in the 18- 22x range. At the midpoint of that value range, Premier Nutrition is likely a 4.7 billion enterprise value. Given that we think POST\u2019s EBITDA multiple will be unchanged after an IPO of Premier Nutrition, the IPO should create over $2 billion of value for Post shareholders and that is still ahead of us,\u201d commented Pivotal Research\u2019s Timothy Ramey.\n\nThis prompted the four-star analyst to reiterate his Buy rating and $140 price target on August 2. His price target is the highest out of all the analysts that have assigned a rating to POST as well as implies that share prices could surge 33% over the next twelve months.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Investors could be in for a bumpy ride this October.
