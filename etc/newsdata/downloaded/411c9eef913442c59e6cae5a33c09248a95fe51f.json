Yes, they were signed to Factory Records and had a prerequisite arty name (chosen over Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Afterbirth). But OMD dressed like suburban bank clerks and singer-bassist Andy McCluskey danced like someone at an office party who\u2019d had one too many shandies. Even their more experimental tracks had pretty melodies. All this was enough for Factory boss Tony Wilson to tell McCluskey that his band were \u201cthe future of pop music\u201d.\n\nWhich indeed they were. After signing to Richard Branson\u2019s label Virgin in the early 80s, the group racked up 13 Top 40 hits and sold 40m records. They are now celebrating what McCluskey calls their 40th birthday with a tour, despite splitting for a decade in 1996.\n\nIn 2019, McCluskey\u2019s dancing has become more exaggerated and outrageous. He windmills and pulls crucifixion poses, careers around as if he\u2019s at a vigorous aerobics class and at one point resembles a hippy undergoing a psychedelic experience. Titter we may, but McCluskey\u2019s antics are part of OMD\u2019s show: you could never accuse them of being one of those \u201cblokes standing behind synthesiser\u201d bands. (Although the four-piece lineup does include two blokes standing behind synthesisers.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest More futuristic than their wildest dreams ... Andy McCluskey. Photograph: Andrew Benge/Redferns\n\nMcCluskey, of course, is in on the joke, telling the audience not to replicate his moves in case they \u201churt each other\u201d and introducing the song Tesla Girls by saying: \u201cAnd now the dancing really starts.\u201d He describes the setlist as \u201cold ones, new ones, weird ones and definitely dancey ones\u201d. Tracks from 2017\u2019s The Punishment of Luxury, which returned them to the Top 5, brilliantly retool their classic sound. Weird comes in the form of Factory B-side Almost, and Stanlow is an electronic elegy about the unlikely subject of an oil refinery in Liverpool. Messages and Souvenir \u2013 the latter sung by co-founder Paul Humphreys, stepping out from behind his keyboard \u2013 are electronic symphonies almost statuesque in their beauty. Joan of Arc and Maid of Orleans teleport the crowd back to the days when OMD made not one but two stellar pop singles about the French saint who was burned at the stake.\n\nSign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras Read more\n\nModern technology and computer graphics mean OMD sound pristine and look far more futuristic than their wildest dreams in 1979, when a Revox reel-to-reel tape machine on stage was hi-tech. There\u2019s more of a party atmosphere at their shows these days, too. When the hits start piling up and McCluskey yells, \u201cLet me see your hands,\u201d the entire audience oblige, and Wirral\u2019s Kraftwerk turn all Queen at Live Aid. The songs So in Love, Pandora\u2019s Box, Locomotion, Sailing on the Seven Seas and the rest are classy, clap-along electropop. By now, McCluskey is playing air keyboard and asking the cheering crowd to \u201cdance your socks off\u201d for Enola Gay.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to end where we began,\u201d he urges, introducing Electricity. Their debut single is now a timeless marvel \u2013 The Magic Roundabout theme played from outer space \u2013 although McCluskey, a trim, perfectly voiced 60, has his own theory about why OMD remain in such fine fettle: \u201cPeople have taken the piss out of my dancing for 40 years, but it keeps me fit.\u201d\n\n\u2022 At Bonus Arena, Hull, on 28 October (sold out).
