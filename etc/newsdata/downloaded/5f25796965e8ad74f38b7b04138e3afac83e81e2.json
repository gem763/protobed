USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 Jose Altuve, drenched in champagne and beer with an MVP trophy tucked away in his locker, walked back onto the field Saturday evening, and there she was running towards him.\n\nIt was his daughter, 2 \u00bd-year-old Melanie, jumping into his arms, taking off his cap, placing it back on his head sideways. She picked up a piece of confetti and gave him a kiss.\n\nOne day, she\u2019ll be told the whole story, and fully grasp what happened this night.\n\nMaybe then, she\u2019ll truly understand the moment, and savor it like every other Astros fan for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe night Altuve hit that home run.\n\nWith one swing, the 5-foot-6 Altuve provided the Houston Astros with one of the most magical moments in franchise history, a two-out, ninth-inning homer, lifting the Astros past the New York Yankees, 6-4, into the World Series.\n\nThe 29-year-old Altuve was named the ALCS\u2019s Most Valuable Player for his heroics, batting .348 with two homers, three RBI and six runs in the series.\n\n\u201cIt was a Joe Carter-esque home run,\u2019\u2019 Astros president Reid Ryan said. \u201cHe is the best player in baseball.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd maybe the best to ever wear an Astros\u2019 uniform.\n\n\u201cI've said things for five years now, I've talked about how great this guy is,\u2019\u2019 Astros manager A.J. Hinch said, \u201cand he continues to exceed expectations. It's not easy to deliver the way he does.\n\n\u201cThe playoff version of him is spectacular. He's turned himself into a star in his career here, and yet he's remained humble, he's remained hungry.\n\n\u201cEverything that's right about the Astros is Jose Altuve.\u2019\u2019\n\nWORLD SERIES: Astros set up showdown with Nationals\n\nYANKEES: Bombers went the whole decade without World Series trip\n\nEven Hall of Famer Craig Biggio couldn\u2019t recall a more electrifying moment in franchise history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Josey doing Josey things,\u2019\u2019 Biggio said during the celebration on the field, with the sellout crowd in no hurry to go home. \u201cJust a remarkable player. Look at the hardware he has at home.\n\n\u201cWhen he\u2019s healthy, there\u2019s really nothing he can\u2019t do. He can beat you in every way. With his glove. His speed. His power. He\u2019s incredible.\"\n\nJose Altuve is hoisted on the podium after the Game 6 win. (Photo: Eric Gay, AP)\n\nThen again, how many players could hit the biggest home run of their life and the first thing out of their mouth is giving all the credit to teammate George Springer for drawing a two-out walk?\n\nYep, so much for self-promotion and worrying about his brand.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s him, that\u2019s Jose Altuve,\u2019\u2019 said Astros outfielder Josh Reddick. \u201cI mean, we just had our hearts broken. And he put it back together.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Astros were two outs away from winning the ALCS in the top of the ninth, when D.J. LeMahieu hit a home run just beyond the outstretched glove of right fielder George Springer, tying the game, and silencing the road of the crowd.\n\n\u201cIt was heart-wrenching to see the ball bouncing around on the front row,\u2019\u2019 Reddick said. \u201cI put my hands on top of my head. Your heart hits the floor.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd then the bottom of the ninth came around.\n\nAroldis Chapman, the Yankees\u2019 All-Star closer, opened the ninth by striking out Martin Maldonado, and getting Reddick out on a pop-up. Then he walked Springer, giving the Astros hope.\n\nAltuve, knowing that Chapman had to be cautious, watched him throw a 98.5-mph fastball for ball one. Then another, 97.3 mph fastball for ball two.\n\nThat\u2019s when Reddick, sitting on the dugout stairs to the far end of the bench, leaned over to Brantley and blurted out:\n\n\"'He\u2019s going to win it.\u2019\"\n\nChapman, desperate to regain his control, went to his slider, 85.3-mph, for a called strike.\n\nHinch thought about having Springer steal second, putting him in scoring position so a hit would win the game, but then worried about the Yankees intentionally walking Altuve, bringing up light-hitting Jake Marisnick.\n\n\u201cI was kind of thinking, maybe he can hook a ball in the corner,\u2019\u2019 Hinch said, \u201cand can George score from first. A couple of years ago, we won a game here [off Chapman] by hooking a ball down the corner, so I was thinking maybe we could do the same.\u2019\u2019\n\nChapman, not wanting to fall behind, tried to throw another slider for a strike.\n\nIt hung over the plate.\n\nAnd Altuve swung with all of his might.\n\nThe ball soared 407 feet into the night, high above the left-center-field fence, and the celebratory scream pierced the air, with Chapman standing on the mound with his mouth wide open, saying later, \u201cI was in shock.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cI just started running,\u2019\u2019 Springer said, \u201cknowing if it didn\u2019t go out, I\u2019ve got to score. I didn\u2019t really remember what happened next. I just had to remember to touch home plate. ...\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not anything he does that doesn\u2019t surprise me anymore. That\u2019s why he is our guy. He\u2019s an unbelievable player, but even a better person, and to have him in that situation is exactly what we wanted.\u2019\u2019\n\nBrantley, who signed a two-year free-agent contract to join the Astros after spending 10 years in Cleveland, could only laugh at Altuve\u2019s modesty. He was aware of Altuve\u2019s talents over the years. Come on, everyone knows about Altuve, a former MVP, three-time batting champion, six-time All-Star and a World Series champion.\n\nStill, unless you\u2019re around him every day, you don\u2019t appreciate his greatness.\n\n\u201cTo see how hard he works every day, and what he does not only on the field but what he does in the locker room and how much he cares,\u2019\u2019 Brantley said, \u201cit\u2019s awesome to watch. It\u2019s awesome to be a part of.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a special player for a long time, but what he did tonight only adds to his legacy.\u2019\u2019\n\nThis is a player who came up on one of the worst teams in baseball. The Astros were the laughingstocks of baseball, losing 324 games from 2011-2013. Now, here is Altuve, the heart and soul of a potential American League dynasty.\n\n\u201cI still remember when we lost 100 games three years in a row,\u2019\u2019 Altuve said. \u201cIt seems like we were in the very, very bottom. So the only hope I had was to keep working hard because everybody keeps telling me, 'Yeah, we're going to win a championship, we're going to be a really good team.' I wanted to be a part of that.\u2019\"\n\nNow, here they are, four victories away from winning their second World Series championship in three years, facing the Washington Nationals on Tuesday in Game 1 at Minute Maid Park.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to the World Series,\u2019\u2019 said Altuve, \u201cbut we're not going to the World Series because of me. We're going to the World Series because of everybody inside of the clubhouse.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cThis was a great series, and unbelievable series, but the only difference, is that we have Jose Altuve,\" said Ryan, the club's president since 2013.\n\n\"The Yankees didn't.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that simple.\"", "description": "The 2017 AL MVP came through with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth to clinch the best-of-seven series and send Houston to the World Series.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
