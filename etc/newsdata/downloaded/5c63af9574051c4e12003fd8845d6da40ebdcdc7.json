When he does something that\u2019s bad for workers, I say so. And I have to say, unfortunately, while he may not even know what his administration is doing, they\u2019ve done more things to hurt workers than they have to help them.\u201d\n\nTrumka said union voters were important in putting Trump in the White House.\n\n\u201cHe came to our members and said, \u2018I\u2019m going to change the rules of the economy,\u2019 and they believed him. And, quite frankly, I wish he would have changed the rules of the economy,\u201d Trumka told Wallace.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the rules he\u2019s changing has hurt them. He\u2019s opposed every increase in the minimum wage. He\u2019s changed the regulation to take overtime away from a couple of million people ... He\u2019s rolled back health and safety standards [for] workers.\u201d\n\nTrumka complained that \u201creal wages are down\u201d because they\u2019re increasingly being gobbled up by \u201chousing costs and health care.\u201d And Trump\u2019s \u201cresponse to that was to propose a trillion-dollar cut to Medicare and Medicaid [and] to oppose increases into the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cLook, our members are still waiting for the supposed greatness of this economy to reach their kitchen tables. When they do, I\u2019ll cheer, they\u2019ll cheer and they\u2019ll all support the person who helped get it there.\u201d\n\nTrumka said the trade regulations are \u201cunenforceable.\u201d He said Mexican wages will remain \u201cartificially low and they will suck jobs and capital out of the United States.\u201d He added: \u201cAn unenforceable trade agreement is a windfall for corporations and a disaster for workers.\u201d\n\nAs for China, Trumka said it\u2019s good the president has taken on the country, but he\u2019s \u201cdone it the wrong way.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo take on China there has to be a multilateral approach. One country can\u2019t take on China ... If you\u2019re going to take on China, it has to be multilateral, it has to address human rights and labor rights violations,\u201d said Trumka. \u201cIt has to address currency rebalancing, and it has to have a long-term slant towards good jobs in this country. That\u2019s not been the approach, unfortunately.\n\nTrumka made many of the same points that farm association leaders have expressed in recent weeks. Roger Johnson, the head of the National Farmers Union, also said last week that Trump should have taken on China as part of a team of allies. Farmers have complained that the China stalemate and other administration policies are decimating their livelihoods.\n\nCheck out Trumka\u2019s full interview in the video above.", "description": "\"Our members are still waiting for the supposed greatness of this economy to reach their kitchen tables,\" Richard Trumka tells Chris Wallace on Fox News.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6c854e2400004f0071c40d.png?cache=czhugbicm5&ops=1778_1000"}
