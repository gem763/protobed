That threatened to give President Bashar al-Assad and his Iranian and Russian backers a free hand. It also jeopardized hard-won gains against the Islamic State \u2014 and potentially opened the door for its return.\n\nThe Kurds\u2019 deal with Damascus paved the way for government forces to return to the country\u2019s northeast for the first time in years to try to repel a Turkish invasion launched after the Trump administration pulled American troops out of the way. The pullout has already unleashed chaos and bloodletting.", "description": "The deal is a major turning point in the war as the U.S. abruptly abandons years of policy built on collaboration with a Kurdish-led militia to fight the Islamic State and on limiting the influence of Syrian government backers Iran and Russia.", "authors": ["Ben Hubbard", "Charlie Savage", "Eric Schmitt", "Patrick Kingsley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/world/13syria9-promo/13syria9-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
