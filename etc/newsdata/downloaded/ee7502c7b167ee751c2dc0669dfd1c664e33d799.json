An incredible game comes to an end. England do just enough to secure victory and move clear at the top of Group A. But Kosovo deserve a lot of credit for their second half display. At 5-1 down with 45 minutes played, they could easily have succumbed to a heavy defeat. But they rallied and played some excellent, attacking football after the break. England, meanwhile, will be pleased with their attacking output, particularly from Sterling. But there are still concerns defensively. England 5-3 Kosovo 90 minutes There'll be five minutes of added time. YELLOW CARD England 5-3 Kosovo 88 minutes Rashkaj has been booked for an earlier challenge on Mount in the buildup to Rashford's chance. It's a dreadful tackle, high and reckless, and could easily have brought a red card. England 5-3 Kosovo 87 minutes So close for Celina! He sets off on a brilliant run, weaving down the left and cutting inside before curling a shot towards the bottom corner. Pickford stretches but can get nowhere near it, and watches as the ball flashes just wide. Advertisement England 5-3 Kosovo 86 minutes More chances go to waste for England! Mount sets Rashford clear down the left and his shot is saved by Muric. Sterling looks certain to tap in the rebound but somehow clears the crossbar from a couple of yards out. Thankfully, the flag is up for offside anyway. SUBS England 5-3 Kosovo 85 minutes And a change for Kosovo: Berisha is off for Florent Hasani. SUBS England 5-3 Kosovo 85 minutes Now Sancho, with a first-half brace to his name, makes way for Rashford. SUBS England 5-3 Kosovo 84 minutes Mason Mount replaces Barkley as England make their first change. Advertisement YELLOW CARD England 5-3 Kosovo 83 minutes Berisha goes into the book for petulantly kicking the ball away. It takes some of the gloss off an excellent night for the Lazio man. England 5-3 Kosovo 81 minutes Another England counter attack breaks down as Barkley looks to slide a pass into the path of Sancho. They've been strangely wasteful in the second half. England 5-3 Kosovo 79 minutes England are looking to take the pace out of this game now, keeping possession and making Kosovo chase the ball. Time is running out for the visitors. England 5-3 Kosovo 75 minutes Keane is next to go for goal, heading a Henderson cross just wide at the near post. This game is being played at a relentless, breathtaking pace. Advertisement England 5-3 Kosovo 74 minutes Sterling goes close again! A Kosovo attack breaks down and England race away through Sancho on the counter. He sweeps the ball into the path of Sterling, whose shot is deflected and rolls agonisingly past the post. England 5-3 Kosovo 73 minutes So close! Somehow England don't have a sixth goal. Kane robs Halimi of the ball and plays Sterling through on goal. Muric does just enough to turn his effort from close range against the post, and the ball bounces clear. England 5-3 Kosovo 72 minutes Celina finds space on the edge of the box and goes for goal, but powers his shot over the bar. England 5-3 Kosovo 71 minutes Alexander-Arnold takes the free kick and curls a low effort wide of the post.
