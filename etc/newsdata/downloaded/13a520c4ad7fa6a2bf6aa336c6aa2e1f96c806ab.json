Grandiose as that team\u2019s legacy is \u2013 it could have been greater. There was a historic opportunity wasted.\n\n\u201cWe should have won three in a row,\u201d Pedro tells The Independent now. \u201cFor that prestige, to confirm ourselves as the best, to keep winning the Champions League like all the historic teams.\u201d\n\nOne game sticks in the memory more than most. He 2009/10 semi-final against Inter Milan. Barcelona should have won the tie. Instead, they lost 3-2 on aggregate.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how we lost,\u201d Pedro wonders. \u201cIt was one of my worst days as a Barca player.\u201d\n\nBut for Jose Mourinho and Inter it was their greatest day. It was the tie that ensured the Italian club\u2019s only treble \u2013 and their first European Cup in 45 years \u2013 in turn breaking a huge \u201cpsychological barrier\u201d.\n\nThis was the power of Mourinho at that point. This was also the feat he personally preferred above all others. It was not just that he\u2019d beaten \u201cthe best team in the world\u201d, but the comprehensive and multi-faceted manner of it, as well as the way everything he had said and planned came to pass.\n\nThere was even a moment in the first leg where Mourinho surveyed the utter chaos his tactics were causing in this supposedly perfect Barcelona and felt a total satisfaction.\n\nThere was also the fact he had predicted this. At half-time of that game, with his players having just fought back from Pedro\u2019s opening goal for Wesley Sneijder to equalise, Mourinho told them the game had definitively changed. He assured them that, if they continued applying the counter-attacking game they were by then completely in-tune with, they would win 4-1 or 5-1.\n\nThey only won 3-1 in the end, but the comprehensive nature of the victory convinced the Inter players of his genius, confirmed him as a man of destiny. Such perceived clairvoyance matters in football because it fosters the kind of deluded self-belief required for sporting defiance. It was that belief which set the searing intensity required for the second leg at Camp Nou.\n\nMourinho would say his players \u201cshed blood\u201d. Maicon literally lost teeth.\n\nLittle wonder that one source tells The Independent that this was when Mourinho \u201cthought he was God\u201d, and could do no wrong.\n\nHe could do no right by Barca. Referencing one of his many jabs at his former club over the years \u2013 in this case about diving \u2013 the Camp Nou crowd chanted ahead of the second leg: \u201cMourinho, go to the theatre.\u201d\n\nThe stage was thus set for the greatest of dramas. Mourinho himself said it was like \u201ca great movie\u201d. Pedro, and pretty much everyone else, acknowledges it was an \u201cepic\u201d.\n\nIt was a tie for the ages, and as such one of those that so totally involved you in the moment. Through that, it was perhaps the first modern Champions League semi-final, one of the \u201ctrue finals\u201d that set the tone for these now regular clashes of super-clubs where the extreme concentration of talent demanded such concentration of attention.\n\nYou could not turn away.\n\nAs befitting all fine drama, it also had eternal themes. A clash of grand philosophies. Principles being compromised. Great all-time displays. Moments that rippled through history. Quests for holy grails. Personal journeys. Revenge. And a lot of long-term influence.\n\nMourinho would say his team getting through the second leg was \u201ca miracle\u201d, and afterwards gave thanks in the Camp Nou\u2019s famous chapel. In fact, an act of God did shape the entire tie. The Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano erupted in Iceland on 20 March 2010, closing European airspace.\n\nThat ensured the tie would start with Barcelona travelling over 1,000km by bus. It ended with Mourinho parking \u201cthe airbus\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd it worked,\u201d he later said with a smile.\n\nThis was the driving force of the tie, and the season: stopping Barcelona, whose eruption under Pep Guardiola had far greater consequences than the volcano.\n\nBarcelona had exploded European football open and changed it forever. They changed the parameters of what was considered possible. Although Guardiola\u2019s teams have since set new standards for super-clubs, their excellence \u2013 and general points return \u2013 was at that point unprecedented. Over two years the defending European champions had not lost a game by more than two goals, of the few they\u2019d lost at all. The question that defined the season was whether they could tactically be bested at all.\n\nThat was because of what now looks like one of the most inspired and influential decisions in football history, and one that also involved the rejection that would give the tie its spark.\n\nIn early 2008, the Barcelona hierarchy \u2013 principally Ferran Soriano, Txiki Begiristain and Marc Ingla \u2013 were appointing a successor to the jaded Frank Rijkaard. It came down to a straight choice. On one side, there was their own B-team manager in Guardiola, who\u2019d been in the profession less than a year. On the other, there was Mourinho, the most successful in the game.\n\nIn the end, they went with what was obvious to them. Looking to revitalise the club, the hierarchy felt they had to go to \u201can extreme, our real essence\u2026 and take Guardiola\u201d.\n\nThat was what Mourinho took such offence to. The Portuguese has had a habit of turning against clubs who turned him down, but that was never as pronounced as with Barcelona due to his history there.\n\n\u201cHe is a bit poisoned by the fact that he was rejected,\u201d Ingla told Graham Hunter.\n\nThat single decision would set in place so many of the pieces for this tie, and of course set Mourinho on the path to Inter. His career ambition was to win league titles in four different countries, and the Champions League with three different clubs. Here was one of the great clubs offering a defined route and desperate for his European expertise.\n\nMourinho went on to build a team in his mental image, which was players with a point to prove; professionals in their prime desperate to finally win the Champions League. This was the key to the emotional intensity the Portuguese demanded. This was one of the keys to the season. \u201cIt was a team with desire, that knew what it wanted,\u201d says Diego Milito, one of nine players who started the second leg against Barcelona over the age of 28. \u201cVery good players, technically and tactically very intelligent.\u201d\n\nMourinho would describe it as \u201ca strong, cynical, intelligent, pragmatic team\u201d. Exactly of the mature type he idealised.\n\nInter did develop \u201ca sense of destiny\u201d over that season, first defined in the signature Mourinho performance that was the last-16 win over Chelsea. All of Wesley Sneijder, Walter Samuel and Esteban Cambiasso had been discarded by Real Madrid, in whose Bernabeu stadium the 2010 final would be held.\n\nThere was then the highly fired-up Samuel Eto\u2019o, himself discarded from Barcelona\u2019s treble winning team by Guardiola because of \u201ca feeling\u201d. That move was at the core of another sub-plot, given it facilitated the transfer of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.\n\nThe Swede \u2013 quite literally \u2013 stood at the centre of this, given the issues that were to come. Ibrahimovic had wanted out of Inter as he had come to the conclusion he \u201cwas never going to win the Champions League\u201d there.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think the team were good enough,\u201d he would later admit.\n\nThe high price of his transfer inadvertently helped change that and he instead became the reason Guardiola felt Barcelona ultimately failed to win the Champions League that season.\n\n\u201cI put a star player before my own game plan, thinking about the \u20ac60m he had cost us instead of following through on my own ideas,\u201d the Catalan told Marti Perarnau in Pep Confidential. Inter president Massimo Moratti had insisted on that price, so that it would be greater than the fee AC Milan received from Real Madrid from Kaka, one of the moves that forced Sneijder out of the club. It was quite the cost.\n\nIt was also quite the turn. Ibrahimovic had actually started the season well, in a period that saw Guardiola and Mourinho face off for the first time ever. It was a tepid 0-0 draw at the San Siro to open the Champions League, and an entirely phoney war beyond the angry response to the Swede.\n\nBarca would beat Inter 2-0 in their genuinely important next group match, albeit with Ibrahimovic on the bench. Even Mourinho was forced to pay homage to their \u201cspectacular football\u201d that night.\n\nThat would be instructive for him, enriching the bigger games to come. It became apparent Ibrahimovic just did not get Guardiola\u2019s way of playing. He didn\u2019t get out of the way, either, as he so often just obstructed their passing and the movement of Leo Messi.\n\nGuardiola was already considering dropping him when the Swede got injured. With Messi moved to false nine, Barca won the crucial April Clasico against Real Madrid 2-0 \u2013 even without the injured Andres Iniesta. That would effectively seal the destination of the title, but the discussion would shape some of the path to the Champions League.\n\nBefore that, though, there was the actual 1,060km path to Milan. Barca held out hope until the last possible moment of being able to fly, even if it was from Nice to Milan.\n\nThey were eventually resigned to setting off from their Ciutat Esportiva base at 2.43pm on the Monday morning before the Wednesday game.\n\nUefa never considering suspending the match.\n\nSome players couldn\u2019t believe this was the solution. Others know it was one of those things. All had to lump it. On the eight-hour first part of the journey, the squad messaged former teammate Eidur Gudjohnsen joking about his country\u2019s volcano, and watched \u2018Invictus\u2019 as well as \u2018Inglorious Basterds\u2019. They arrived at Hotel Martinez de Cannes at 10.55pm, before setting off again at 10am the next morning. Airspace had still not opened, so the journey finally came to a close at 2.20pm the next day, at Hotel Melia Milano.\n\nZlatan described it as a \u201cdisaster\u201d and others said they felt fatigued. But Bojan Krkic now insists to The Independent it was \u201cnot the reason we lost\u201d.\n\nThere were certainly other major factors. One was what was happening while Barca were travelling. Mourinho was already thinking deeply and rigorously preparing his players for an intricate two-part plan.\n\nWhat most occupied his mind was the first part of that plan, which was \u2013 of course \u2013 how to inhibit Messi. Mourinho was fixated on it.\n\n\u201cEvery time I played against Messi, I spent hours studying him,\u201d Mourinho told a few journalists at Chelsea in 2015. \u201cIt is not about stopping him but giving him a difficult match. That is the best you do against him.\u201d\n\nThat was because of the particularly explosive problem Messi\u2019s mercury-like movement posed. Mourinho needed his side to be \u201ccompact\u201d around the box and limit all space there to also minimise the effect of Barcelona\u2019s inevitable possession. But there was one obvious \u2013 but almost unstoppable \u2013 way in which Barcelona would be able to prevent this defensive plot.\n\nIt involved Dani Alves darting down the right and Messi cutting inside, to send defenders scrambling in both directions. The usual counter-measure would be for the opposing centre-halves and central midfielders to pass the responsibility for the Argentine on to the next player, but what prevented this was when one of the other Barca attackers would press and draw one of those defenders.\n\nThis was when the fatal gap would appear. And this was when Messi was lethal and one of his most underappreciated talents would come alive. He possessed the lateral vision to spot and then dart into that gap in an instant, thereafter using his talent to fully exploit it.\n\nMinimal opening, maximum effect.\n\nAny time you see Messi apparently standing idle and detached from a game, this is what he\u2019s doing. He is sizing the game up and instantaneously analysing exactly where the fracture points in a team\u2019s defensive framework are.\n\nMourinho, however, arrived at a similar moment of \u201cclarity\u201d. He devised a four-man gabbia \u2013 Italian for jail \u2013 for Messi that would constantly restrict where he could move. It required a certain risk, given the freedom it would allow other Barcelona players, as well as full concentration.\n\nThis was where the emotional intensity Mourinho engendered fully came in.\n\n\u201cHe gave us information nobody else could give us,\u201d Sneijder told Champions magazine in 2010. \u201cThat is the power of Mourinho.\u201d\n\nIt still wasn\u2019t the full plan. The second part was arguably even more difficult, since it necessitated attack without weakening that defence.\n\n\u201cWe knew we\u2019d have no chance in the second game if we didn\u2019t win at home,\u201d Mourinho said. So he had to find that balance. It again came down to timing.\n\n\u201cObviously the strategy to try to hurt them was in our attacking transition, the moment we recover the ball,\u201d Mourinho later explained in an enlightening Coaches\u2019 Voice video. \u201cAnd we know of course the way of their building-up, going with Alves and Maxwell forward really, really wide and leaving lots of spaces.\u201d\n\nInter would thereby wait for the ball to go to the side \u2013 and then pounce with full force.\n\n\u201cWe were fundamentally going from a defensive low block but going very, very strong with three, four, five players into attacking positions in the transition.\u201d\n\nIt all required an immense amount of concentration, patience and discipline to avoid \u2013 as Javier Zanetti put it \u2013 the \u201csiren call of the ball\u201d. It was then little wonder Mourinho said in the pre-match press conference it would be \u201ca game played with the head more than the feet\u201d.\n\nLittle wonder the pre-match tactical talk was split over two days, so the players could fully register it. This was what playing Barcelona involved.\n\nThis is why, any time anyone asks Mourinho about the epic second leg of this tie, he instantly snaps back: \u201cI prefer the first.\u201d\n\nGuardiola being Guardiola, he spent just as much time running the possibilities for the game over and over in his head.\n\nThose close to him say he knew he should have dropped the just-returned Ibrahimovic. All the evidence was there, especially from the wins over Inter in the group stage and then Madrid.\n\nIbrahmovic revealed in his autobiography t was almost like Guardiola was probing him for an excuse during the last training session.\n\n\u201cCan you play from the first whistle?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you ready? But are you ready?\u201d\n\nGuardiola decided to stick rather than twist, and it left Barca\u2019s frontline so much more static.\n\nThis was evident from the first whistle. And particularly the first attack.\n\nRight in the centre of a San Siro Stadium soundtracked by that soaring and screeching noise you only hear for the highest-profile games, Maxwell escaped down the left and crossed for Ibrahimovic. It was a rare moment when he got free of Lucio and Walter Samuel but, rather than head it, the Swede went for one of those idiosyncratic aerial back heels.\n\nIt was an unnatural move, and seemed self-indulgent, if also inevitably stilted.\n\nIt reflected the display. Having Ibrahimovic at the centre inhibited everything that Barcelona usually did so well. The ball was repeatedly played both to the feet and heads of Lucio and Samuel, with Xavi forced to play specific types of pass, which in turn forced Messi out of where he played best.\n\nThat made it easier for Inter to execute the first part of that plan.\n\nThe tie came down to Guardiola getting it wrong as much as Mourinho getting it right. Similarly telling was that Barcelona\u2019s solitary goal came without Ibrahimovic touching the ball. It did come from one of Maicon\u2019s \u201ctrigger\u201d runs forward, though, emphasising just how difficult Inter\u2019s balancing act was.\n\nA space was opened, Maxwell cut back, and Pedro scored. It was a crucial away goal, and now exactly the situation that perfectly suited Barcelona.\n\nIt could have been fatal, especially given Inter\u2019s three defensive errors that led to Pedro\u2019s shot. They were among the last they would make.\n\nMourinho had warned them of this. He\u2019d spoken about it so much the players knew not to panic. They stuck to the plan.\n\n\u201cNothing changed when they went ahead,\u201d Sneijder said.\n\nThe gameplan, however, began to change the game.\n\nInter began to create more chances. Diego Milito had two of them, snatching badly wide at the second in the 27th minute.\n\nLike so many Inter players, though, he didn\u2019t let such mishaps cow him. His persistence and work rate were a key part of the victory, as was almost immediately displayed.\n\nA mere minute later, Eto\u2019o found Milito in the centre. The Argentine drew three defenders and, with supreme presence of mind, slipped the ball out for Sneijder to finish.\n\nThe San Siro came alive again. Inter were back in the tie. But there was more to it than that. Mourinho\u2019s plan had become visibly concrete. They now had full belief in it to go with their goal, emboldening everything they did.\n\nMinutes later, Messi tried to cut inside, only to be shepherded well by Samuel before Esteban Cambiasso went in strong.\n\nThis was the jail, on full lockdown.\n\nThis was why Mourinho was so convinced his plan would win it.\n\nIt still needed execution, though, and no one executed it as fully as Maicon. Mourinho later described him as \u201ca physical marvel\u201d, and while there were so many players key to applying that plan, it was Maicon\u2019s running that connected the two parts.\n\nFired up by his manager\u2019s half-time talk, the Brazilian burst up the pitch in the 47th minute, after another moment when Messi was aggressively dispossessed. The ball was played out to Milito on the right, who squared it to the onrushing Maicon. He eventually forced it past Victor Valdes, Seydou Keita stumbling to the ground in his slipstream.\n\nIt was \u201cexactly\u201d what Mourinho envisaged. The third goal was much the same but even cleaner.\n\nA lightning counter led to Eto\u2019o clipping the ball to the right, Sneijder heading it back from the left, and Milito finishing from close range. It was just reward for the Argentine. It was just the best of Mourinho: assured defending fused with ruthlessly cutting counter-attack, thanks to forensic tactical planning and fierce motivation.\n\nAgainst that, there was only chaos within the Barca side. It was symbolised by the image of their players falling to the ground as Inter scored. It was what Mourinho took such satisfaction from. Barca \u201ccouldn\u2019t cope with this\u201d, he told Coaches\u2019 Voice.\n\nInter did get the benefit of more fortune, as replays showed Milito was marginally offside.\n\nEven allowing for that, it\u2019s still difficult to overstate just how stunning this was. It was the first time Guardiola\u2019s Barca had been made look fallible, let alone to this extent.\n\nGuardiola himself, meanwhile, had seen enough. Ibrahimovic was instantly hauled off, having ran the same distance as Valdes.\n\nBarcelona quickly improved, although some of that was down to the natural state of the game. It became what was more widely expected beforehand, and the second leg was to completely become: Barca probing with possession, Inter defending defiantly \u2013 and occasionally desperately.\n\nDani Alves seemed to break through in the 83rd minute, only to be brought down by Sneijder. Portuguese referee Olegario Bequerenca took out a yellow card for diving rather than point to the spot \u2013 the ensuing row resulting in the yellow card for Carlos Puyol that would keep him out of the return. It lead to all manner of accusations in the Catalan press about the official\u2019s \u201cfriendship\u201d with Mourinho.\n\nGuardiola did admit Inter were the better team and Barca were off their best, but couldn\u2019t resist a dig. \u201cIf Messi\u2019s shirt is grabbed three times, they score on the counter, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d\n\nHe also complained that Inter wouldn\u2019t let them water the pitch, \u201cwhich was in a very bad state\u201d.\n\nIn the tunnel, Xavi sarcastically asked Mourinho about the ref, only for Mourinho to snap back: \u201cWhich one are you asking me about, from the Chelsea game last year?\u201d\n\nSources from the stadium say Xavi was irritated after it.\n\nMourinho, of course, ramped it all up when speaking to the press.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal they get angry losing, because they\u2019re not used to it. You can\u2019t win it all. It\u2019s not easy to accept it, but that\u2019s football.\u201d\n\nGuardiola realised what Mourinho was doing. His players were animatedly angry about all of it in the dressing room afterwards, even if many feel that was as much down to their own sense of frustration. The Catalan told them not to be provoked.\n\nNevertheless, a spark was set. A tone was set. The greatest drama was still to come.\n\n***\n\nOver the next few days, Barcelona\u2019s anger was focused. The word remontada \u2013 comeback \u2013 kept being repeated like a mantra, particularly by the late Tito Vilanova. The assistant was already saying it by the time they reached the boarding gate at Malpensa airport. Barca were by now able to fly, but wanted to run through walls \u2013 which was pretty much going to be called for.\n\nAfter the next league match, a 3-1 win over Xerez, the players wore t-shirts proclaiming \u201cwe\u2019ll play out of our skins.\u201d\n\nGuardiola meanwhile issued a call to arms for fans, declaring \u201cnow it\u2019s time for Barca at their maximum\u201d.\n\nThe refrain in the dressing room was \u201cwe\u2019re going through, lads\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou could feel the atmosphere, and what it meant,\u201d Bojan tells The Independent. Guardiola even had a motivational video prepared like the Gladiator one he used ahead of the 2009 Champions League final, but actually decided against showing it because of how fired up his squad were.\n\nGerard Pique perhaps summed it up. \u201cI want the Inter players to hate their profession for 90 minutes.\u201d\n\nThis was the wave Mourinho was preparing those players for. This is why he set about constructing the wall.\n\nIt was to be a game of extremes. If the first match was the ultimate showcase of Mourinho\u2019s management, this was to be the ultimate clash of football fundamentals: all-out attack against all-out defence.\n\nThere was only one part to the Inter plan this time: just defend. Leave the ball, concentrate on the space.\n\nIt was much easier to explain, but still so difficult to execute.\n\nMourinho told his players to sit deep, only press within 25 yards of their own goal, and use strict zonal marking. It was going to take \u201cblood\u201d, and the most intense concentration, in the most intense of atmospheres.\n\nMourinho, of course, was only too happy to stoke that atmosphere. It was all part of the gameplan, as Guardiola realised. With Barca players actively talking about how a final in the Bernabeu was a \u201conce in a lifetime opportunity\u201d, the Portuguese played on this.\n\n\u201cWe want to follow a dream,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cBut it\u2019s one thing to follow a dream and another to follow an obsession. For Barcelona it\u2019s an obsession\u2026 It\u2019s an obsession you can see and feel.\n\n\u201cTo have a Catalan flag in the Bernab\u00e9u is an obsession.\u201d\n\nHe might well have touched on something with Guardiola, who grew up a Barca obsessive just accustomed to the European Cup being Madrid\u2019s. The point, however, was to crank the current Barca team up so much they didn\u2019t play their normal game. And that was what Guardiola was emphasising in the dressing room: \u201cBe faithful to the style. Come out fast.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t quite faithful to himself, though. Guardiola had again considered leaving Ibrahimovic out, for Messi to play as the false nine. Guardiola again relented.\n\nThe Swede was there in the centre again, as the storm rose. The Barca anthem was belted out.\n\n\u201cYou could feel the atmosphere of the stadium,\u201d Bojan says. \u201cThe fans had been there hours. It was a match of special characteristics.\u201d\n\nAnd initially a match that started entirely as expected: Barca probing, Inter frustrating, all of that within 25m of Julio Cesar\u2019s goal. That did actually suit Ibrahimovic more, and he was performing better, more involved. A sign of the battle came in the 10th minute when the Swede got up from the turf after a tussle with Lucio, and pointed to his ripped shirt.\n\nReferee Frank de Bleeckere still didn\u2019t point to the spot.\n\nMoments later, Maicon careered into an advertising hoarding after contesting a ball with Messi. It was the second time in the tie he had to receive significant treatment. These were the levels.\n\nInter\u2019s approach had already been further conditioned in the moments before kick-off, when Goran Pandev got injured and had to be replaced at left-wing by left-back Christian Chivu. If this naturally made them more defensive, the infamous moment in the 26th minute completed that job, and really detonated the game.\n\nThiago Motta did swipe out at Busquets face, but the player acted like he\u2019d been blinded, before so notoriously peeking through his fingers to see if the Inter midfielder would be punished. He was. Motta was sent-off. It was the greatest impudence, all the more so because Motta himself had warned of this before the game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to seeing the Barca players throwing themselves to the ground a lot. The important is to play clean.\u201d\n\nBut he didn\u2019t, and it was a case of two wrongs leading to a right. And maybe the right thing for Inter, too.\n\nThey went right down to that purity of performance that only extremes can bring. Mourinho, having made such a show of theatrically laughing at the decision, still had the presence of mind to quickly go full defence. Chivu was moved inside, Milito to the left, and Eto\u2019o to the right. There was no striker. There was only will.\n\n\u201cWe had to go deep and find our strength,\u201d Milito explains.\n\n\u201cIt conditioned them to go even further back,\u201d Bojan says.\n\nAs Guardiola attempted his own reshuffle and beckoned Ibrahimovic over, Mourinho couldn\u2019t resist going up to them.\n\n\u201cYou think it\u2019s all over, but it\u2019s not,\u201d he quipped.\n\nIt was only beginning.\n\n***\n\nThe great problem for Barcelona, and great virtue of Mourinho\u2019s psychological management, was that Inter\u2019s defending was so focused \u2013 both positionally and mentally \u2013 that there just wasn\u2019t even an inch of space around their box. The absence of Iniesta was never more telling. There just wasn\u2019t an opening for their quick movement or overlaps, or angle to play that classic Barca pass from central midfield to an oncoming wide player.\n\nEvery route was closed off, usually by the kind of classically Italian defending where just getting anything on the ball seemed to be mean everything. This was symbolised by one full-bodied Samuel block on a close-range Ibrahimovic shot in the 38th minute.\n\n\u201cThey were just creating so many lines of defence,\u201d Pedro tells The Independent now. \u201cEto\u2019o was playing as a full-back. I remember coming across lines of five, six\u2026 it was so difficult to find space.\u201d\n\nJulio Cesar had by then already been cautioned for time-wasting. They even left the Barcelona players on the pitch for what seemed like an age after the half-time break.\n\nThis was the greater challenge for Barca. They game was one of those battles against time as much as the opposition, with the challenge of having to remain patient but yet counter-intuitively needing to up the tempo to get to certain points by certain stages. They first had to just get a goal.\n\nThe pressure, the atmosphere, was immense.\n\n\u201cWe felt that weight all game,\u201d Pedro explains.\n\nIt was in itself an ingenious piece of counter-intuitive thinking by Mourinho, judo-like. Barcelona prize the ball, so give it to them, and use that against them.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want the ball because when Barcelona press and win the ball back, we lose our position,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI never want to lose position on the pitch so I didn\u2019t want us to have the ball. We gave it away.\n\n\u201cI told my players that we could let the ball help us win and that we had to be compact, closing spaces.\u201d\n\nThere had been a slight crack shortly before half-time, when Messi suddenly broke free and burst across the box, before unleashing a shot that Cesar just touched away.\n\nThis was that challenge again. This was the warning for Inter.\n\nThis just caused them to squeeze the space even further. Barca were always trying to open a phalanx of 10 players. Xavi referred to them \u201changing off the crossbar\u201d.\n\nMaicon went on to describe it as \u201csuffering\u201d, but whether that meant they hated their jobs in the manner Pique desired is another matter. There was that exhilaration that comes from the deepest reserves of effort.\n\nInter by that point had just 19% possession. Their rare touches, however, were enough. Guardiola again had seen enough. Ibrahimovic was brought off along with Busquets, and Bojan and Jeffren were brought on.\n\n\u201cIn matches like this, there\u2019s such tension you\u2019re already so involved in the game,\u201d Bojan says. \u201cPep just wanted to me to get in the area.\u201d\n\nAnd move. The increase of small nimble players, combined with Inter\u2019s growing fatigue, gradually began to bring cracks.\n\nOn 83 minutes, Messi found sufficient space to clip in a fine cross for Bojan, only for the forward to head it wide.\n\nOn 84, Barcelona got that first goal back. It came from Pique having been moved up front, but not from any battering-ram tactics. It was from the most nimble of footwork. Xavi finally found the space to play one of those passes and, with Julio Cesar coming out and substitute Ivan Cordoba coming from behind, Pique deftly turned with two touches. It left the two Inter players looking the wrong way and the goal open.\n\n3-2 on aggregate. Barcelona needed one more to win on away goals.\n\nThe roar said enough. This was the grandstand finish. This was when the pressure was at its most intense, when everything about the game, and the competition, and the teams, was distilled into one defining spell.\n\nThis was the purest level of Champions League football.\n\nBut the purest level of drama was still to come.\n\nBoth Xavi and Messi tested Cesar with precise shots that reflected the intense focus of the moment. There was not a single moment for the slightest error.\n\nIn stoppage time, with Inter entirely pegged back into their box, Yaya Toure charged down another attempted clearance. It found its way to Bojan, who struck. The way the ball soared into the very top corner seemed to symbolise the release and relief the Camp Now felt, as Bojan and his teammates careered away in celebration.\n\nUntil they were hauled back.\n\nThe ball was adjudged to have struck Toure\u2019s arm. It was still 1-0. Inter were still going to Madrid.\n\n\u201cBojan is the only player that almost killed me with a heart attack,\u201d Mourinho would later say.\n\nThe game was killed. That was it. Appropriately, the last action was Inter hacking the ball away.\n\nFull-time.\n\nBarca players sank to the ground in despair, Inter players sank to the ground in exhausted exhilaration. Mourinho meanwhile ran manically towards the Inter supporters at the very top of the Camp Nou, pointing to the sky.\n\nValdes bizarrely tried to restrain him and the pitch sprinklers came on \u2013 but there was no stopping him. Still \u201cin the moment\u201d, Mourinho told the media his players were \u201ca team of heroes\u201d, and spoke in almost viking terminology.\n\n\u201cWhen the moment of leaving everything on the pitch arrives, you don\u2019t leave the skill, you leave the blood.\u201d\n\nHe also described it as \u201cthe most beautiful defeat of his career\u201d.\n\nAs all this was going on, there was only \u201csilence\u201d in the Barcelona dressing room. Guardiola was as forlornly introspective as anyone, running over everything that happened in his head.\n\n\u201cNobody spoke,\u201d Bojan says. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t the time for any kind of team talk.\u201d\n\nIt was Mourinho\u2019s time.\n\n***\n\nWhen Mourinho eventually went to Real Madrid that summer, the image he picked to decorate his new office was not one from the victorious 2-0 win over Bayern Munich in the Bernabeu, or any other trophy-lifting moment. It was him running and pointing to the sky in the Camp Nou, which he had made into a life-size cut-out.\n\nIt reflected the game\u2019s status as his favourite career moment. It was why he got the job at Madrid. Bernabeu president Florentino Perez immediately closed the deal, convinced of Mourinho\u2019s transcendent genius.\n\nBut, brilliant as it was, it didn\u2019t quite occur to Perez how much had gone in Inter\u2019s favour to facilitate that win.\n\nTo actually stop Barca, it ultimately took a volcano, an injury to one of the greatest players ever in Iniesta, a rare bad tactical decision from Guardiola, a number of hugely questionable refereeing decisions including one blatant call over handball in the last minute and \u2013 yes \u2013 a whole lot of luck.\n\nThese were the fine margins behind such a seismic result. This was what Guardiola was so intensely mulling over in the dressing room after the game. It was pretty much there and then that he decided he himself had to take the hard decision to discard Ibrahimovic and bring in a much more suitable forward in David Villa.\n\nMessi would meanwhile be finally moved into the centre, signalling his last great ascension as a player.\n\nThe effect of this could be most resoundingly seen in the next meeting between Mourinho and Barcelona, when Real Madrid were utterly thrashed 5-0 in one of those signature performances.\n\nIt illustrated why, although Mourinho was pointing to the sky that night, the only way was down. It was why that victory was not just a last hurrah for that Inter team, but also a last hurrah for that style of football.\n\nThis was one reason the game was so historically compelling. It was one philosophy on the rise, one on the decline, but just meeting at the perfect point for conflict and combustion.\n\nIt also meant it was a wholly imperfect time for Mourinho to be going to Madrid with a God complex.\n\nThat was because he was going to a club who weren\u2019t discards, but authoritative champions in their own right. A club which did not look up to him. They also saw his football as beneath them.\n\nThe reality was that the sport was already being taken over by one of the most profound evolutions in the game, which was started by Guardiola.\n\nThe Inter result would offer the final resolve to really complete this Barcelona team, and offer their most complete performance: the 3-1 Champions League final win over Manchester United in 2011.\n\nThey may not have achieved the gold-standard of three European Cups in a row, but they did achieve a gold-standard display that had far greater influence.\n\nIt is why Pedro isn\u2019t so down about the failure of 2010, nine years on.\n\n\u201cI think Barcelona has that status as the best ever. For everything, for the players, the best player in the world, and a philosophy and idea of play very clear.\u201d\n\nAnd part of it came from one of the greatest ever ties.", "description": "It is something that many have previously suggested about that great Barcelona side of 2008 to 2012, but that Pedro Rodriguez now freely admits.
