(AP Photo/Wade Payne)\n\nTennessee linebacker Jeremy Banks placed a call to his coach Jeremy Pruitt after he was arrested on the UT campus in September.\n\nBanks was pulled over on Sept. 15 after making a U-turn. University of Tennessee police then discovered that he didn\u2019t have his driver\u2019s license because it had been suspended and there was also a warrant out for failing to appear in court on a citation for driving with a suspended license from July.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBanks was arrested after that discovery. He then asked to call Pruitt and, as police prepared to drive him to the Knox County Detention Center, told a woman on a ridealong in the back seat of the squad car that \u201cMa'am, you don't wanna be an intern because where I'm from we shoot at cops. I'm from Memphis, Tennessee.\u201d\n\nBanks placed call to Pruitt, handed phone to officer\n\nBanks told officers he wanted to call Pruitt and then gave the arresting officer his phone to talk to the man he identified as Pruitt. The conversation that ensued was captured on body camera footage. The footage was obtained by WBIR News 10.\n\nPruitt asked why Banks was being arrested after he had been pulled over for a traffic stop. The officer told Pruitt that he was obligated to arrest Banks because of the warrant from the state of Tennessee, which Pruitt said he didn\u2019t know about.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand this,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cThe kid don\u2019t have nobody at home to help him like figure out how to do this and he came to ask how to do it. His grandfather died and we got the people from the state troopers\u2019 office to walk him through how to do it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m kind of confused why he would have this.\u201d\n\nPruitt then asked the officer if there was a date on the warrant that was out for Banks.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThis is the silliest s--- I\u2019ve ever seen in my life, Pruitt said. \u201cI got it. I understand. I worked at four places and they never had no crap like this except for here. Because the people usually say \u2018hey, something\u2019s not right here.\u2019\u201d\n\nPruitt issued a statement on Tuesday. The school also said that Banks\u2019 traffic issues had been resolved.\n\n\u201cJeremy\u2019s behavior and comments are unacceptable and portrayed himself and our football program very poorly and he understands that,\u201d Pruitt said in the statement. We will address the matter internally. I\u2019m determined to do what I can to help Jeremy grow up and become a better man. Our team and staff respect our law enforcement and we will continue to educate our players on how to carry themselves at all times.\u201d\n\nBanks apologizes for conduct\n\nBanks became agitated during the arrest when he was in the back seat of the car. He made the comment about shooting at cops to the woman in the back seat as he was waiting to be taken to the detention center. The topic then came up again a few minutes later.\n\n\u201cPolice is lame, ma\u2019am I don\u2019t think you want to be a police, you remember what I told you,\u201d Banks told her.\n\n\u201cThat you were going to shoot me?\u201d she replied.\n\n\u201cNo I ain\u2019t said nothing like that. Don\u2019t put words in my f ------ mouth.\u201d\n\nBanks also asked what one of the officers would do without his \u201cbadge.\u201d The officer replied \u201cWouldn\u2019t be here dealing with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cY\u2019all don\u2019t want to see me without that badge,\u201d Banks said in return.\n\nBanks issued a statement through the football program on Tuesday and apologized for his actions in the video.\n\n\u201cI want to sincerely apologize to my family, the University of Tennessee and the law enforcement community,\u201d Banks said. \u201cI deeply regret my language and attitude in the video. I have great respect for our policemen and women, and I am embarrassed by my actions that night. That\u2019s not who I am. I promise to be a better representative for the University of Tennessee moving forward.\u201d\n\nBanks\u2019 arrest came two days after he had two interceptions in Tennessee\u2019s win over Chattanooga. The sophomore did not play against Florida on Sept. 22.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Jeremy Banks was arrested a day after he had two interceptions against Chattanooga.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uu.73IwZAuN6c894iw08fg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05NTQuNjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A0WOzYAR3RBgU_soK9_WLQ--~B/aD0zMDk2O3c9NDE1MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/8e44d870-e4b9-11e9-b7de-224e441fdb65"}
