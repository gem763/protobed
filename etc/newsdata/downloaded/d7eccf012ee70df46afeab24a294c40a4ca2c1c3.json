Gold gives confidence in the power of the central bank's balance sheet. That gives a safe feeling,\u201d it continues.\n\nSound arguments\n\nWhile it is known that central banks have begun buying up gold since the 2008 financial crisis, it is the DNB\u2019s phrasing that has excited Bitcoin (BTC) proponents in particular.\n\nAs a form of sound money with the highest stock-to-flow ratio of any commodity, gold previously ensured the sound functioning of economies before governments uncoupled their national currencies from its backing over the last century.\n\nSince then, as Saifedean Ammous noted in his popular book, \u201cThe Bitcoin Standard,\u201d telltale signs of decay have plagued most countries\u2019 economies.\n\nCentral banks, notionally in charge of fiat currencies, use interventions to manipulate their supply artificially, something which is all but impossible to do with gold due to its stock-to-flow ratio.\n\nThis championing of the precious metal\u2019s qualities over paper money thus did not go unnoticed among Bitcoin figures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an established central bank! Speaks to the times we live in,\u201d Gabor Gurbacs, digital asset manager at VanEck, tweeted in response to DNB.\n\nHe continued:\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that private/non-sovereign moneys have a place in our world. Private moneys should be allowed to compete in the free market with central bank moneys.\u201d\n\nNovogratz: Current economic climate bullish for decentralized \u201cdigital gold\u201d\n\nLater, serial investor Mike Novogratz struck a similar tone, telling CNN that both gold and Bitcoin, as sound money, would benefit from current fiat trends.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got geopolitical uncertainty, we\u2019ve got negative rates; it\u2019s all bullish for gold and bullish for Bitcoin,\u201d he said in an interview on Oct. 11.\n\nNot everyone agrees, however. As Cointelegraph reported, Apple CEO Tim Cook claimed earlier this month that only governments should control money.\n\nHe was speaking within the context of the ongoing difficulties Facebook is encountering with the release of its planned digital currency, Libra. Apple, he said, would not seek to follow its lead.\n\nAround the same time, Germany\u2019s finance minister likewise said that states should be in control of monetary activities.\n\nPast utterances from the DNB meanwhile have dismissed cryptocurrencies, claiming they do not fulfill the functions of money at all.", "description": "The Dutch central bank raised eyebrows by admitting fiat could fail and society would then need actual sound money to survive", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYmI3NmVkZDNkMzEzYjFiZWFjMjU3NTljMjA4NzBjOGUuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
