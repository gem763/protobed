He said the city\u2019s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, acted in bad faith by bypassing the Legislative Council, Hong Kong\u2019s parliament, in invoking the emergency law.\n\n\u201cThis is a Henry the 8th situation. This is basically I say what is law \u2026 and I say when that ceases to be law. That\u2019s not how our constitution works,\u201d Kwok told a news conference late Saturday. \u201cWe say that she doesn\u2019t have such powers, that she cannot avoid\u201d the Legislative Council.\n\nThe court will hear the case Sunday morning. Lam has said she will seek the council\u2019s backing for the law when its session resumes Oct. 16 and hasn\u2019t ruled out further measures if the violence continues.\n\nLawmaker Claudia Mo called the Emergency Ordinance a \u201cweapon of mass destruction\u201d that could pave the way for more draconian regulations.\n\nKwok said the group also asked the court to rule that the emergency law, enacted by British colonial rulers in 1922 to quell a seamen\u2019s strike and last used in 1967 to crush riots, was incompatible with rights and freedoms under Hong Kong\u2019s constitution that was put in place after it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nIn a televised address broadcast as protesters again marched in masks on Saturday, a solemn Lam described Hong Kong as \u201csemi-paralyzed\u201d and reiterated the mask ban was needed to stop the violence.\n\nMany malls, shops and the entire MTR network of subways and trains that usually handles more than 4 million trips a day shut Saturday following the overnight rampage.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to take drastic measures to say no to violence, restore peace in society, protect citizens\u2019 right to continue their daily lives and freedom, not allowing a small group of rioters to destroy it,\u201d Lam said.\n\nMany peaceful protesters say violence has become a means to an end, the only way for young masked protesters to force the government to bend to clamors for full democracy and other demands.\n\nBut the shooting of the teen Friday night - the second victim of gunfire since the protests began in early June - stoked fears of more bloody confrontations. An 18-year-old protester was also shot at close range by a riot police officer on Tuesday.\n\nPolice said in a statement Saturday that the 14-year-old, who was hospitalized with a gunshot wound on his thigh, has been arrested for participating in a riot and assaulting a policeman. Police have said they are still investigating exactly how he got shot.\n\nA Hospital Authority spokesman said the teen was in serious but not critical condition.\n\nProtesters in masks popped up in the central business district Saturday afternoon, carrying a yellow banner marked \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d and shouting, \u201cHong Kong, resist!\u201d There were other scattered gatherings, with some holding hands in a long human chain and chanting anti-police slogans in an open-air stadium.\n\nTrouble brewed at night, however, with police saying pockets of protesters again blocked roads and vandalized shops and public property in several districts but left before police arrived.\n\nPolice said no arrests had been made so far on the anti-mask ban but didn\u2019t explain why.\n\nProtester numbers Saturday appeared down from previous weekends when tens of thousands flooded the streets. Some marchers said the protest movement that has become a big headache to Chinese President Xi Jinping was merely harboring strength for the long haul.\n\nBut the extensive violence has turned some to the government\u2019s side, even though they blamed Lam for sparking the protest movement with a now abandoned bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts in mainland China.\n\n\u201cThere is outright rioting,\u201d said retiree Peter Tai, 67, stocking up on groceries for fear they\u2019d become hard to find.\n\n\u201cProtesters want democracy and freedom, but don\u2019t they have freedom now? People can go anywhere and do things freely,\u201d he said. \u201cFreedom is more valuable than democracy. I hope these young people don\u2019t do things they\u2019ll regret forever.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press videojournalist Katie Tam contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A group of pro-democracy Hong Kong legislators filed a legal challenge Saturday against the government's use of a colonial-era emergency law to criminalize the wearing of face masks at rallies to quell anti-government demonstrations, as the protests diminished in intensity but didn't stop.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Leicester", "Eileen Ng"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/hong_kong_protests_55569_c0-209-5000-3124_s1770x1032.jpg?d90e3d455f0268dece892f6c8cc4108909694c0b", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
