The Independent reported Wednesday that river police stopped the vessel over concerns that it was traveling too fast.\n\n\u201cOur vehicle has the right to go at 30km/h [18.6 mph], when normally the speed limit on the river is 12km/h [7.5 mph],\u201d SeaBubbles CEO and co-founder Anders Bringdal told The Independent. \u201cSo they just pulled us over to check our paperwork and make sure that all was in order.\u201d\n\nIt was then allowed to go on its way.\n\nNEW HERMEUS SUPERSONIC AIRCRAFT WOULD MAKE NY-LONDON TRIP IN 90 MINUTES\n\nOrganizers are holding test runs this week on one white, oval-shaped electric hydrofoil boat that resembles a tiny space shuttle gliding past Paris monuments.\n\nThe Seabubbles website describes the vehicle as \u201czero wave, zero emission, zero noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that pollution and global gridlock are not only threatening our welfare, but are ultimately threatening people\u2019s freedom of mobility,\u201d it says.\n\nBIZARRE 'BIRD OF PREY' AIRLINER CONCEPT DESIGN REVEALED\n\nThe boats can fit four passengers, and if they get approved, can be ordered on an app like land taxis, shared bikes or other forms of transport.\n\nIts designers hope to run the so-called Seabubbles commercially in Paris and other cities starting next year.\n\nBringdal told The Associated Press that \"the most important for us is no noise, no waves, no pollution. And bring them into cities that are congested.\"\n\nThe SeaBubbles CEO said the water taxi will \"not only be fun\" but also makes economic sense.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "description": "A futuristic, eco-friendly water taxi was pulled over by police on the River Seine in Paris, according to The Independent.", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/FlyingTaxi2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
