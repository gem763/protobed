Then we spammed the hell out of the Register\u2019s Twitter account. The original statement explaining why they published the article in the first place has under 400 retweets and over 7,000 comments \u2014 well done, angry folks.\n\nBut we didn\u2019t stop there. The fun went on as people rejected Register\u2019s attempt to go back to business as usual. Its tweet featuring an objective news piece about President Trump received one retweet and 145 replies \u2014 from us. Another, about fall dining events in Des Moines, got two retweets and 261 replies from us. A tweet about a new Wells Fargo CEO has 49 replies from us and no retweets.\n\nWe did the same to Anheuser-Busch, which chickened out and dumped King in the wake of the Register\u2019s ever-so-dogged reporting on his activities as a high school sophomore. As a result, the company deleted every single one of its tweets about King. And still, Iowa Oktoberfest pulled Busch Light from their brews as a punishment.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tiana Lowe", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Carson-King-Has-Created-A-Blueprint-For-Resisting-Cancel-Culture"], "top_image": ""}
