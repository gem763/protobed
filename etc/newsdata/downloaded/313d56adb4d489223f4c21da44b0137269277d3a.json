Speak to your sons about gender stereotypes\n\n\u201cChipping away at stereotypes from a young age is important,\u201d says Emma Citron. \u201cIf any stereotypes or prejudices leak out, for example \u2018boys are stronger than girls, and they climb the climbing frame and are so good at everything\u2019, you can start to present other points of view. \u2018You may not be noticing that girls are doing X or Y\u2019 or \u2018actually they are very good at maths\u2019.\u201d\n\nBooks that challenge gender norms can literally undo children\u2019s perceptions of gender stereotyping. Victoria Richards\n\nFor Jordan Jones, every moment is a learning opportunity for his two children, from watching a Disney movie to taking a bus together. He recently taught his daughter about mansplaining: \u201cI said to her, \u2018it\u2019s quite interesting that that man interrupted that woman when she was speaking, and then said exactly what she was going to say\u2019. And she\u2019ll say in her 8-year-old brain, \u2018yeah, actually that is quite weird that he\u2019s just explaining it again, he didn\u2019t have to explain it\u2019. So now she has the [understanding] without me forcing it on her.\u201d He says he\u2019ll use the same approach with to his son too as he grows older.\n\n2. Empower them to be their own person and show their emotions\n\nVictoria Richards worries that her toddler son will face pressure to become \u201ca man\u201d as he grows older, which seems to mean not expressing emotions and treating women a certain way. She wants him to be comfortable with being emotional and be able to express himself however he likes. Her son recently chose to wear a pink and white checked bow hairband to nursery. \u201cIt\u2019s not saying, \u2018you have to wear this\u2019 or \u2018you can\u2019t wear this\u2019, but saying \u2018you\u2019re totally free to wear this if you want to\u2019.\u201d\n\nJordan agrees that he will let his son wear what he wants, and do what he wants - \u201cas long as it\u2019s safe and appropriate\u201d.\n\n3. Read diverse books and encourage a range of toys\n\n\u201cBooks that challenge gender norms can literally undo children\u2019s perceptions of gender stereotyping,\u201d says Victoria, who wants her son to read the same books as her daughters.\n\nShe recommends stories about girls in science or sports, or boys who don\u2019t conform to macho stereotypes, and is currently enjoying a book about a boy who dresses up as a mermaid. She adds that she is also mindful of shows that conform to more traditional gender stereotypes, such as Peppa Pig.\n\nVictoria adds: \u201cProvide boys with a range of options, offer them dolls and buggies and things that people might traditionally associate with girls\u201d.", "description": "How do you raise your sons to be good men?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07l6rt7.jpg"}
