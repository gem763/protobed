These cause the kind of infections that people pick up in hospitals.\n\nEvery McDonald\u2019s screen that was swabbed was found to have poo bacteria on them (Picture: Susannah Ireland for metro.co.uk)\n\nThe machines have been rolled out in McDonald\u2019s branches across the UK (Picture: Susannah Ireland for metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018For instance Enterococcus faecalis is part of the flora of gastrointestinal tracts of healthy humans and other mammals. It is notorious in hospitals for causing hospital acquired infections.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnsuspecting diners choose their food on the touchscreens then head to the server to pick up their burgers more often than not without washing their hands.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nA screen at one branch was found to have staphylococcus, a bacteria that can cause blood poisoning and toxic shock syndrome.\n\nDr Matewele said: \u2018Seeing Staphylococcus on these machines is worrying because it is so contagious.\n\n\u2018It starts around people\u2019s noses, if they touch their nose with their fingers and then transfer it to the touchscreen someone else will get it, and if they have an open cut which it gets into, then it can be dangerous.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, Oxford Street, near Tottenham Court Road station (Picture: Susannah Ireland for metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018There is a lot of worries at the moment that staphylococcus is becoming resistant to antibiotics. However, it is still really dangerous in places like Africa where it can cause toxic shock.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMetro.co.uk\u2019s study with the university\u2019s school of human sciences involved swabs taken from eight McDonald\u2019s restaurants. Six in London and two in Birmingham.\n\nListeria bacteria was found in Oxford Street and Holloway Road branches. It can cause listeriosis which can lead to miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant women.\n\nDr Matewele said: \u2018Listeria is another rare bacterium we were shocked to find on touchscreen machines as again this can be very contagious and a problem for those with a weak immune system.\u2019\n\nThree quarters of the screens swabbed showed traces of the bacteria proteus.\n\nDr. Paul Matewele , microbiology and immunology expert, was shocked at the findings (Picture: Susannah Ireland for metro.co.uk)\n\nTouchscreens at Holloway Road, McDonald\u2019s where listeria and other bacteria were found (Picture: Susannah Ireland for metro.co.uk)\n\nDr Matewele said: \u2018Proteus can be found in human and animal faeces. It is also widely distributed in soil. It can cause urinary tract infections and is also one of the hospital acquired infections where it may responsible for septicaemia.\n\n\u2018Klebsiella is also from the gut and mouth, they are associated with urinary tract infections, septicemia and diarrhoea. Some species can infect the respiratory tract resulting in pneumonia.\u2019\n\nDr Matewele added: \u2018Touchscreen technology is being used more and more in our daily lives but these results show people should not eat food straight after touching them, they are unhygienic and can spread disease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Someone can be very careful about their own hygiene throughout the day but it could all be undone by using a touchscreen machine once.\u2019\n\nMcDonald\u2019s does clean the screens with disinfectant but Dr Matewele said it \u2018could not have been strong enough.\n\nPetri dishes of bacteria found in various McDonald\u2019s in London and Birmingham (Picture: Susannah Ireland for metro.co.uk)\n\nDr. Paul Matewele testing for bacteria at London Metropolitan University (Picture: Susannah Ireland for metro.co.uk)\n\nHe added: \u2018These bacteria can be on touchscreen machines for days on end.\n\nA McDonald\u2019s spokesman said: \u2018Our self-order screens are cleaned frequently throughout the day. All of our restaurants also provide facilities for customers to wash their hands before eating.\u2019\n\nWhich McDonalds were tested?
