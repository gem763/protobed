Vice president pence today heads to Turkey hoping to broker a cease-fire deal. This as Russia moves in to fill the void left by the U.S. Withdrawal. Let's get right to our chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz there in Washington and, Martha, we're just hearing from Turkey's leader on this. Reporter: We sure are, Cecilia. Turkey's president is strongly rejecting calls for a cease-fire this morning saying he will only talk to president trump in Turkey in person but in a matter of hours, vice president pence will be on his way to Turkey to lead a delegation trying to stop Turkey's assault on the kurds as U.S. Forces continue their dangerous withdrawal from northern Syria. With Turkey pounding northern Syria taking key terrain, a close call for American troops. Turkish militias coming dangerously near a U.S. Base. The Americans responding with a show of force. F-16 fighter jets and apache helicopters in the air. And as the 1,000 American troops move out under president trump's orders, the Russians are filling the void rolling through the country with Syrian government forces. This Russian journalist giving a tour of what appears to be a now abandoned U.S. Base. A basketball court now empty. This Russian who has worked for pro-government media saying the Americans were here yesterday and now we are. But well over 175,000 people have now been displaced and scores killed and injured. Our kurdish allies feeling betrayed but president trump saying he doesn't want U.S. Forces policing 7,000 miles away. We want to bring our soldiers back home after so many years and they're the greatest warriors in the world. They're policing, they're not a police force. Reporter: On capitol hill, senate majority leader Mitch Mcconnell rejecting that idea. It makes us a prudent and responsible world power. It stands up for our own security and the freedom of others. Reporter: But president trump is unconvinced. A senior U.S. Official telling ABC news that the commander of kurdish forces spoke to president trump urging had him to keep more troops in Syria but the president said the official told him he did not need to go halfway around the world to fight ISIS. Defiant despite the backlash.
