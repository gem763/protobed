The technology has been banned for law-enforcement purposes across California, and a similar bill is being weighed in Massachusetts. Meanwhile, artists and researchers have begun to develop clothes designed to thwart algorithms that detect human faces.\n\nBut emerging technology presents alternate means of identifying and tracking humans beyond facial recognition. These methods, also driven by artificial intelligence, detect the presence of humans using devices ranging from lasers to WiFi networks.\n\nThe vast range of biometric data that technology can register makes regulation difficult. Meanwhile, some of the emerging surveillance technology is already being embraced by military powers like the US and China.\n\nHere's a rundown of emerging technology that can detect humans and track their location.", "description": "Emerging technologies can recognize humans and track people's location by detecting their heartbeat, walking gait, and even skin cells left behind.", "authors": ["Aaron Holmes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db75555dee0195c293f0132?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
