I\u2019m so (expletive) glad we got Osuna!'\u201d\n\nOsuna, the Astros closer, was suspended 75 games last season after he allegedly assaulted the mother of his then-3-year-old child.\n\nOPINION:MLB needs to address Astros' history of troubling behavior\n\n\"Domestic violence is extraordinarily serious and everyone in baseball must use care to not engage in any behavior \u2014 whether intentional or not \u2014 that could be construed as minimizing the egregiousness of an act of domestic violence,\" MLB said in a statement issued a little over five hours before the first pitch of Game 1 between the Astros and Washington Nationals.\n\nThe Astros issued an apology on Tuesday from Taubman in which he said he realized his comments were \"unprofessional and inappropriate.\"\n\n\"My overexuberance in support of a player has been misinterpreted as a demonstration of a regressive attitude about an important social issue. Those that know me know that I am a progressive and charitable member of the community, and a loving and committed husband and father. I hope that those who do not know me understand that the Sports Illustrated article does not reflect who I am or my values. I am sorry if anyone was offended by my actions.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Crane reiterated the Astros' commitment to \"create awareness and support on the issue of domestic violence.\"\n\nHowever, MLB acknowledged the Astros have disputed Sports Illustrated's characterization of the incident.", "description": "Houston Astros owner, exec issue apologies in wake of controversial comments made in front of three female reporters.", "authors": ["Steve Gardner", "Published P.M.
