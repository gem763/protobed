The Republican\u2019s margin of victory was 4,160 votes out of about 185,808 cast.\n\nThey had been in a neck-and-neck race heading into Election Day. Their closely watched race pitted Mr. Bishop\u2019s pro-Trump campaign against Mr. McCready\u2019s run as a moderate Democrat hoping to ride to Washington on an anti-Trump wave building in the Charlotte suburbs.\n\n\u201cTonight is a victory shared by all who believe in the promise of America, in the promise of American exceptionalism, and the promise of freedom and opportunity,\u201d Mr. Bishop said at a victory party.\n\nHe quoted former President Ronald Reagan, saying those freedoms are not free but must be fought for.\n\nHe also thanked Mr. Trump, saying the president \u201claid himself on the line for this race.\u201d\n\nAt the White House, Mr. Trump took credit for the win.\n\n\u201cDan Bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. He then asked me for help, we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cBig Rally last night. Now it looks like he is going to win. @CNN & @MSNBC are moving their big studio equipment and to talent out. Stay tuned!\u201d\n\nThe results ended an election saga that has left vacant the state\u2019s 9th District seat since Congress convened in January.\n\nThe special election was as much about Mr. Trump as Mr. Bishop, Mr. McCready or the two other candidates on the ballot.\n\n\u201cMy opponent represents the Nancy Pelosi choice and the Elizabeth Warren choice toward Green New Deal, sanctuary cities, which she is specifically in favor of. And ultimately socialism. More government domination of everything. That\u2019s the choice voters have,\u201d Mr. Bishop said earlier in the day on Fox News.\n\nThe district, which Republicans have held since 1963, stretches from the financial hub of Charlotte and its affluent suburbs through rural communities along the South Carolina line.\n\nMr. McCready found a trove of support in the cities and suburbs, where women and college-educated voters are repulsed by Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI am a registered Republican, but I am fed up with the agenda of the Republican Party,\u201d Charlotte suburban voter Bob Southern, 75, told The Associated Press. \u201cI am so disappointed in this president, and he frightens me very much.\u201d\n\nHe said he voted for Mr. McCready.\n\nThe special election was a do-over of the 2018 midterm election in which the results were thrown out because of absentee ballot fraud linked to the campaign of Republican Mark Harris.\n\nThe initial count in November showed Mr. Harris beating Mr. McCready by 905 votes out of more than 280,000 cast. The scandal and the election board investigation of ballot fraud discouraged Mr. Harris from running again.\n\nThe special election attracted national attention because Democrats and Republicans sought bragging rights for the first major test of the 2020 cycle.\n\nDemocrats desperately wanted to show that Mr. Trump\u2019s base had weakened in North Carolina, which is among the six most crucial battleground states he won in 2016 and needs for his reelection bid. The others are Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nMr. Trump, who carried the 9th District by about 12 percentage points over Democrat Hillary Clinton, made holding the district a top priority.\n\nAt a campaign rally Monday in Fayetteville, Mr. Trump called Mr. Bishop an ally in the fight against illegal immigration and what he called the socialist agenda of Democrats. He urged the crowd to use their votes to send a message to \u201cthe America-hating left.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence made a surprise visit Monday. He stopped at a pro-Bishop call center in Charlotte and joined Mr. Bishop for lunch at a barbecue restaurant in Marshville.\n\nMr. Bishop gained national prominence as the author of the state\u2019s \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d which required people to use public restrooms corresponding with their biological sex. The 2016 law touched off protests and boycotts that were estimated to cost North Carolina nearly $4 billion before it was repealed a year later as part of a bipartisan deal.\n\nHe counted on the district\u2019s right-leaning tendencies and played strictly to the Republican base with a pro-Trump message. In a TV ad, he is promising to fight \u201ccrazy liberal clowns\u201d in Washington.\n\nMr. McCready, a Marine veteran, ran a replay of the midterm race with a focus on health care, the same message that helped get enough moderate Democrats elected last year to take control of the House.\n\nHe avoided attacks on Mr. Trump that could have energized conservative voters.\n\nThe political parties and outside groups poured money into the race. Pro-Republican groups helped Mr. Bishop close a fundraising gap. Mr. McCready raised more than $4.8 million for the race, compared with Mr. Bishop\u2019s haul of less than $1.7 million.\n\nDemocratic groups such as the Environmental Defense Action Fund\u2019s super PAC and Stand Up Republic, an anti-Trump super PAC, spent heavily on the race.\n\nBy Monday, the National Republican Congressional Committee and other conservative political action committees had spent more than $6.8 million in support of Mr. Bishop, according to campaign finance data compiled by the political statistics website FiveThirtyEight.\n\nCombining candidate and outside spending, the pro-Bishop forces spent about $8.6 million and pro-McCready forces spent $8.4 million, the data showed.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
