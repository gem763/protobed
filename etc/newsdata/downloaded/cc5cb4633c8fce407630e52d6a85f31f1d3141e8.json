The next big free game update, Visions of N\u2019Zoth, pits Horde and Alliance players against the maddening threat of a powerful elder god. More importantly, it adds two new playable allied races, the fox-like Vulpera and cybernetic Mechagnomes.\n\nWorld of Warcraft game director Ion Hazzikostas really knows how to bury the lede. During the latest developer content update preview video, he goes on and on about players delving into the dark realm of N\u2019Zoth, acquiring items and upgrades to help stave off madness so they can eventually confront the elder god. Haazzikostas talks about N\u2019Zoth invasions of Uldum and the newly-restored Vale of Eternal Blossoms in Pandaria. He doesn\u2019t get to the new allied races until 13 minutes in to the 18 minute video.\n\nThe Vulpera are a race of fox looking critters native to the Vol\u2019dun region introduced in the Battle for Azeroth expansion. I\u2019ve written about them before, specifically about their alpacas and how I long to play as one of them. The Vulpera, not the alpaca. Honestly, I\u2019d take either.\n\nThe Vulpera are the new Horde allied race. Players who\u2019ve completed the Vol\u2019dun questline and have reached exalted with the Voldunai faction will be able to play them when Visions of N\u2019Zoth goes live.\n\nI\u2019ve also talked about the Mechagnomes, residents of the junkyard paradise that is the Mechagon Island zone. They\u2019ve replaced most of their meaty bits with much superior metal parts. Gears, cogs, that sort of thing. Alliance players who\u2019ve reached exalted with Mechagon and have completed a questline can rise above the flesh while remaining below the \u201cyou must be this high to ride this ride\u201d line.\n\nCheck out the video for more, not nearly as interesting information on Visions of N\u2019Zoth.
