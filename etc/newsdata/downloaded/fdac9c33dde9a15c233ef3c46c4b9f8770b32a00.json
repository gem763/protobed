Sea lanes such as the Strait of Hormuz usually feature in such speculation. The facility in question at Abqaiq is perhaps more critical and vulnerable. The Wall Street Journal reported that five million barrels a day of output, or some 5% of world supply, would be taken offline as a result.\n\nTo illustrate the importance of Abqaiq in the oil market\u2019s consciousness, an unsuccessful terrorist attack in 2006 using explosive-laden vehicles sent oil prices more than $2.00 a barrel higher. Saudi Arabia is known to spend billions of dollars annually protecting ports, pipelines and processing facilities, and it is the only major oil producer to maintain some spare output. Yet the nature of the attack, which used drones launched by Iranian-supported Houthi fighters from neighboring Yemen, shows that protecting such facilities may be far more difficult today.\n\nThere are countries that even today see their output ebb and flow as a result of militant activity, most notably Nigeria and Libya. Others, such as Venezuela, are in chronic decline due to political turmoil. Such news affects the oil price at the margin but is hardly shocking.\n\nDeliberate attacks by actual military forces have been far rarer, with the exception of the 1980s \u201cTanker War\u201d involving Iraq, Iran and the vessels of other regional producers such as Kuwait. When Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990, removing its production from the market and putting Saudi Arabia\u2019s massive crude output under threat, prices more than doubled over two months.\n\nYet Saturday\u2019s attack could be more significant than that. Technology from drones to cyberattacks are available to groups like the Houthis, possibly with support from Saudi Arabia\u2019s regional rival Iran. That major energy producer, facing sanctions but still shipping some oil, has both a political and financial incentive to weaken Saudi Arabia. The fact that the actions ostensibly were taken by a nonstate actor, though, limits the response that the U.S. or Saudi Arabia can take. Attempting to further punish Iran is a double-edged sword, given that pinching its main source of revenue, also oil, would further inflame prices.\n\nWhile the outage may not last long given redundancies in Saudi oil infrastructure, the attack may build in a premium to oil prices that has long been absent due to complacency. Indeed, traders may now need to factor in new risks that threaten to take not hundreds of thousands but millions of barrels off the market at a time. U.S. shale production may have upended the world energy market with nimble output, but the market\u2019s reaction time is several months, not days or weeks, and nowhere near enough to replace several million barrels.\n\nAfter the smoke clears and markets calm down, the technological sophistication and audacity of Saturday\u2019s attack will linger over the energy market.\n\nWrite to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com", "description": "The implications of the drone attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq oil-processing facility may be substantial in both the short and the long run for the region and the global economy.", "authors": ["Spencer Jakab", "Spencer.Jakab Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107237/social", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
