That's just one typical symptom of heatstroke, a potentially fatal condition that's an immediate 911 moment. To frame the urgency: an epic 2003 heat wave in France left 15,000\u201318,000 dead. Even when survived, heat stroke can leave the victim with brain or other organ damage\u2014liver, kidneys, lungs, and heart. Heat stroke is caused by over-exposure to high temperatures, usually accompanied by\n\nDizziness, light-headedness, fainting\n\nThrobbing headache\n\nRed, hot, dry skin with no sweating\n\nMuscle weakness or cramps\n\nNausea and vomiting\n\nRapid heartbeat, either strong or weak\n\nRapid, shallow breathing\n\nConfusion, disorientation, or staggering\n\nSeizures, unconsciousness, or coma\n\nWho gets heat stroke?\n\nClassic heatstroke develops over 2\u20133 days of exposure, typically among older (over 50), sedentary people with no air-conditioning who often have inadequate fluid intake. Exertional heatstroke occurs more suddenly and affects healthy, active people like athletes, military recruits, and factory workers. It's the second leading cause of death in young athletes.\n\ndehydration . When your temperature hits more than 105 degrees, your internal regulators crash and your overheated internal organs begin doing the same. It can begin as a milder heat-related illness\u2014heat cramps or heat exhaustion. But it also can strike with full force\u2014without warning. It's important to know the typical symptoms of heat stroke. If you\u2019re out in the heat, be wary if you or someone you\u2019re with experiences:The causes and symptoms of heat stroke are similar in both groups. The highest-risk group is older people with no air conditioning and limited airflow. Others include people of any age who don't drink enough water, have a chronic disease, work or play too long in high heat, or drink excessive amounts of alcohol . Other risk factors include:Children under 4 and adults over 65 adjust to heat less efficiently\n\nTreating heat stroke\n\nMove the person to a cooler space\u2014air-conditioned, if possible, or anywhere cooler or shadier\n\nRemove unnecessary clothing\n\nIf possible, take the person's temperature\n\nFan the person while wetting his or her skin with water\n\nApply ice packs to the victim's armpits, groin, neck, and back, where blood vessels are close to the skin\n\nImmerse the patient in a shower or tub of cool water or an ice bath\n\nPreventing heat stroke\n\nDiabetes; heart, lung, or kidney disease; obesity or underweight; high blood pressure; alcoholism; sunburn and conditions that cause fever all signal increased risk.: Many medications increase the risk of heat stroke. Ask your doctor if yours are among them. Now that you recognize the symptoms, what should you do about them?If you suspect someone has had a heat stroke, delay can kill. Call 911 immediately or get that person straight to a hospital. If help is on the way, here are some immediate interventions you can perform, depending on location:If the temperature is greater than 105 degrees, the goal is to cool it to 101\u2013102 degrees. But if a thermometer isn't handy, initiate first aid anyway. If it's not heat stroke, no harm done. If it's heat stroke, it could be a lifesaver. You should also, if possible:When it's very hot, heat wave or not, it's best to stay in an air-cooled or air-conditioned environment\u2014ideally, your own home. If your home has no fans or air conditioning:\n\nSpend the hottest part of the day somewhere cool.\n\nOpen windows at night and close your blinds during the day to retain the night's cooler air.\n\nCool off under a wet towel and spray cool water on your skin.\n\nChoose foods you can grill or eat cold\u2014don't bake or boil.\n\nDon\u2019t eat large or protein-rich meals\u2014they warm your body from within.\n\nAvoid dehydrating alcohol and caffeine.\n\nWear lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothing and a wide-brimmed hat.\n\nSpend time in air-conditioned public buildings\u2014 malls, museums, and libraries, or in cooling centers\n\nUse a sunscreen of SPF 30 or more.\n\nDrink extra fluids, even if you\u2019re not thirsty.\n\nIf you go outdoors:After recovery from heat stroke, many people are more sensitive to high temperatures for a while. So survivors should avoid hot weather and heavy exercise until their doctor says it's safe to resume normal activities.
