Widely held to be politically motivated, Kabendera\u2019s detention is part of a \u201cvery disturbing\u201d pattern of increasing media repression and intimidation in Tanzania, according to the International Federation of Journalists.\n\nThe accusations against him changed several times, ranging from claims that he was not a Tanzanian national to sedition under cybercrime laws, before the police settled on economic crimes.\n\nKabendera\u2019s lawyer said resolving the economic crimes allegations in the near future would be \u201cmostly impossible\u201d.\n\n\u201cSome people stay [in detention] even for five years,\u201d Jebra Kambole said. \u201cThe only issue that can help Erick is if the investigation will be completed on time, or if the state decides to drop charges against Erick.\u201d\n\nKabendera\u2019s health has deteriorated since being detained, but so far he has not been allowed to go to hospital for medical checks.\n\n\u201cHe complains of breathing difficulties, especially during the night. We don\u2019t know what the problem is because there are no proper medical tests done,\u201d Kambole said. \u201cIn mid-August, both his legs had some sort of paralysis and he said he was getting weak.\u201d\n\nKabendera\u2019s sister, Prisca Kabendera, said she thought he could be experiencing panic attacks.\n\nShe described the ordeal that their family has gone through, especially soon after his arrest, when the authorities said they were trying to \u201cclarify his citizenship\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy father was interrogated by the immigration officers for hours,\u201d she said, adding that the 82-year-old had endured this alone, as he lives on the other side of the country. \u201cHe was taken to his parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 graveyards, taking pictures of him at the graves and even using marker pens to write on unlabelled graves. That devastated him so much.\u201d\n\nThey also confiscated the passports held by Kabendera\u2019s wife and children, in effect holding them hostage, Prisca said.\n\n\u201cThey cannot go anywhere and immigration don\u2019t want to return the passports or clear their citizenship allegations. They won\u2019t return the passports or issue a statement to clear him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s worried about his family, especially the kids. Knowing this whole thing was made up to torture him, he doesn\u2019t know how far they can go.\u201d\n\nIt is very hard to believe that the case against Kabendera is motivated by anything but his work as a journalist, said Kajubi Mukajanga, the executive secretary of the Media Council of Tanzania.\n\n\u201cKabendera\u2019s case has been handled politically from the first moment. Kabendera\u2019s case has left a lot of questions unanswered from the word go,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAccusations against him kept changing, changing, changing \u2013 they brought the citizenship thing, it couldn\u2019t stick, so they left it, they went to cybercrime, that didn\u2019t stick either, so they left it, they went to sedition, it couldn\u2019t stick either, so they left it, and eventually they said: \u2018What the hell? Just charge him with economic crimes, throw him in jail and you don\u2019t have to prove anything.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere has been a deterioration of press freedom in Tanzania under the Magufuli administration, according to several media rights organisations.\n\nTanzanian investigative journalist in court over money laundering Read more\n\nAnother journalist, Joseph Gandye, was arrested and held for two days after investigating reports of police violations including sexual abuse. Azory Gwanda, another reporter, has been missing for nearly two years.\n\nSoon after Kabendera\u2019s arrest, the UK and the US released a statement saying they were \u201cdeeply concerned about the steady erosion of due process in Tanzania\u201d, pointing to Kabendera\u2019s case in particular. The UK is the largest provider of foreign direct investment to Tanzania, and has suspended aid in the past over corruption allegations, while the US spent $446m (\u00a3362m) in foreign assistance in 2018, which means their actions carry weight.\n\nLast year, Magufuli said he preferred Chinese assistance as it carried fewer conditions.\n\nThe pro-government, self-styled activist Cyprian Musiba claimed that the US-UK statement was fabricated by local journalists who had photoshopped the countries\u2019 logos on to the document. \u201cA traitor,\u201d read a recent front page headline by his newspaper, adding: \u201cErick Kabendera backs western nations not Tanzania\u201d.\n\nMukajanga was not optimistic that the environment for journalists would improve soon.\n\n\u201cPeople need to be realistic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe situation will get worse before it gets better.\u201d", "description": "Charges against Erick Kabendera preclude bail, say lawyers, as national media council claims case has been \u2018politically handled\u2019", "authors": ["Ruth Maclean"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2af28c37b8e744dc52c907e0fd2fa3c87da2c815/35_123_2395_1437/master/2395.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=31c9b22227ffbe9823e168b2428253aa", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
