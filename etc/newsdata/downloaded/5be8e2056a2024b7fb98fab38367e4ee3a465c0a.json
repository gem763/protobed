All my animals spent three weeks of terror. Not fair.\"\n\nAnother user challenenged other supermarkets to following in its wake.\n\n\"Please be like Sainsbury\u2019s and ban fireworks and keep them event only,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I\u2019m done with the sound already.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images/EyeEm)\n\nA pet owner described how the sound of fireworks affected their dog.\n\nThey said: \"It's so upsetting to see our rescue Staffie shaking and crying with fear at the sound of fireworks.\n\n\"I hope other outlets follow sainsbury\u2019s stance of not selling them to the public. Should be organised events only.\"\n\nA consultation run by the Scottish Government earlier this year found that 94% of 16,000 respondents wanted to see tighter controls on the sale of fireworks.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/EyeEm)\n\nThe results has led law makes in Holyrood to introduce new sales controls, which will be announced today.\n\nNot everyone is in favour of banning or hampering the sale of fireworks however.\n\nAccording to the Scottish Government's consultation summary, many people made arguments such as: \"We don't have any problems with fireworks in our area. Fireworks are great.\"\n\nOther suggested: \"Some fireworks can be good, for morale, and regulations can keep it safe\u2026\".", "description": "Aldi, Asda and Morrisons have announced they are only selling low noise fireworks ahead of Bonfire Night", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Getty Images Eyeem", "Asda", "Morrisons", "Aldi"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20740365.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Low-Angle-View-Of-People-Watching-Firework-Display.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
