Where one is a fictional, legendary magical artifact of ultimate power, the CELLder wand is a Kickstarter campaign for a possibly fictional hunk of plastic that surrounds a fairly ordinary 3,200 mAh USB battery pack.\n\nI\u2019m going to be honest here: I am an extremely dedicated Harry Potter fan, and I can\u2019t fathom ever wanting this. As a replica wand, it\u2019s awful \u2014 made of plastic and not wood, overly large and chunky, and with tiered extendable layers that make it look more like a cheap toy lightsaber than an elegant tool of magic. And as a battery pack, well, it\u2019s just not very good for the price \u2014 early bird backers can pick up a CELLder Wand for $29 (compared to the planned $50 retail price), but you can pick up a 5,000 mAh battery pack with significantly more charge from companies like Anker for almost half of even the Kickstarter discount.\n\nWhat the CELLder Wand really feels like is an early attempt at cashing in on the Harry Potter fandom \u2014 and specifically, the upcoming Harry Potter: Wizards Unite AR game coming from Pok\u00e9mon Go developer Niantic. Back then, we saw a flurry of slapdash hardware spring up when the popular augmented reality Pok\u00e9mon game hit the heights of its popularity a few years ago, including the Chargemander, a battery pack case for your phone shaped like a Pok\u00e9dex from GogoToro \u2014 the same company behind the CELLder Wand.\n\nBut if your love of unlicensed Harry Potter merch and inefficient charging solutions knows no bounds, GogoToro is planning on shipping the CELLder Wand this September. As for the usual caveat, it\u2019s still a crowdfunding campaign (even if GogoToro has successfully shipped portable chargers before), so use your best judgement before backing.", "description": "The CELLder Wand is a Harry Potter-themed, unlicensed battery pack shaped like a wand.
