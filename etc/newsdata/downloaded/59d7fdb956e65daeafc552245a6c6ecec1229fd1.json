The seven-year-old boy has a fondness for traditionally female items. Due to this, the mother, Dr. Anne Georgulas, has long wanted her son to become a daughter, and has even advocated chemically castrating the boy via puberty blockers and other means. But the father, Jefferey Younger, has insisted that his son does not think he is a girl, and regardless if he did should not be given life altering procedures. A judge ruled on Thursday that both parents would have conservatorship for medical decisions, including how to \"treat\" their son as he goes through puberty into adulthood. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky weighed in on the case on Thursday, saying that allowing a child to choose gender transition medication is \"child abuse.\"\n\nA video surfaced of Jeffrey Younger asking his son who told him he was a girl. James says his mother told him he was a girl, which is why he believes that he is a girl. This was when he was just three years old.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a boy, right?\u201d asks Younger. \u201cNo, I\u2019m a girl,\u201d replies James. \u201cWho told you you\u2019re a girl?\u201d asks Younger. \u201cMommy,\u201d said James.\n\nSen. Paul weighed in after seeing this video, saying, \"We don\u2019t let kids drink alcohol til 21. People want to move smoking age to 21. But we will allow a 7 year old to have his life and body altered like this? This is child abuse and the state should side with the father who is trying to protect the child.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t let kids drink alcohol til 21. People want to move smoking age to 21.
