Her birthday wish was no surprise.\n\n\u201cIt would come in over a month, I guess, and it would be a WNBA championship,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Mystics have taken steps closer and closer to fulfilling that dream. First, they had two major regular-season goals: to secure a top-two position in the standings that earns them a double postseason bye, and if possible, to finish No. 1 to lock up home-court advantage.\n\nThe former is in the bag. For the latter, the Mystics just need to win out.\n\nBeating the Dallas Wings on Friday and the Chicago Sky on Sunday would give Washington a final record of 26-8, out of reach of the second-place Connecticut Sun. Entering Friday one game ahead of the Sun, the Mystics can also clinch home court with a combination of one win and one Connecticut loss.\n\nBut if the teams finish the season with matching records, the Sun hold the head-to-head tiebreaker \u2014 they beat Washington in their season series 2-1.\n\nEither way, the Mystics know they\u2019ll play their first two playoff games Sept. 17 and 19 at the Entertainment and Sports Arena to kick off their league semifinal series. Tickets were available on pre-sale earlier this week.\n\nThe WNBA playoffs may run through the District, even though the Mystics haven\u2019t been fully healthy for about a month.\n\nTheir second-best player, All-Star guard Kristi Toliver, hasn\u2019t played since Aug. 8 after suffering a knee contusion. Coach Mike Thibault said Toliver won\u2019t return until the playoffs, but he\u2019ll try to work her out in two \u201cgame-like situations\u201d between Sunday and Sept. 17.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to play (Toliver) this weekend,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cI think where she is with things, it would be too much of a risk.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, forward Tianna Hawkins will also miss Friday\u2019s game so she can continue to rest a sore knee, but probably will play Sunday, Thibault said. Aerial Powers will play both games after missing some time with a re-aggravated gluteal injury.\n\nThibault hopes the eight-day layoff between the season finale and Game 1 of the semifinals can help Washington return to full health. But in a way, even thinking that far in advance undercuts the team\u2019s exhaustive focus on the game in front of them.\n\n\u201cThe mindset\u2019s the same as it\u2019s been since the first day of training camp. Take whatever the next game is at hand and deal with that,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait and see if Connecticut loses. We just go and win our game \u2026 We\u2019re not worried about Sunday, we\u2019re not worried about 10 days from now. Be better tomorrow than we were today.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never want to look too far ahead, and even though there\u2019s only two games left, you\u2019ve got to take it one at a time,\u201d Delle Donne said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
