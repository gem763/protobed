Brantley hit two run-scoring singles and was a big part of the Houston Astros reversing their dreadful trend with runners in scoring position to beat the Washington Nationals 4-1 and cut their series deficit to 2-1.\n\nGiven his team\u2019s struggles at the plate, manager AJ Hinch could have put hot-hitting rookie Yordan \u00c1lvarez in left field hoping for a big hit or two. He stuck with the sure-handed Brantley, who remained steady as ever.\n\nBrantley singled off starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez in the third and fifth innings and was intentionally walked in the sixth so he couldn\u2019t do more damage. He\u2019s 5 for 12 in the World Series, which is becoming a showcase of the 32-year-old as a professional hitter.\n\nHe blooped an 0-2 pitch from S\u00e1nchez into left field for Houston\u2019s first run of the night and perfectly timed a 3-1 changeup to lace a single to right and restore a two-run lead.\n\nHouston entered the game hitting .175 this postseason with runners in scoring position. Brantley led the way as the club went 4 for 10 in those key spots Friday.\n\nBrantley has seen this spotlight up close, just not in uniform. A right shoulder surgery sidelined him during the 2016 World Series, when his Cleveland Indians teammates lost to the Chicago Cubs in seven games.\n\nHe was used to sitting out by then, of course. A right wrist injury and hand surgery ended his 2011 season, sports hernia surgery was his reward for getting through 2012, right shoulder surgeries spoiled 2015 and 2016, and a right ankle strain hampered him in 2017.\n\nNone of that stopped Brantley\u2019s progression, and he has been an All-Star three years in a row. He got his groove back hitting .309 with 17 home runs and 76 RBIs last season, his final with Cleveland before signing a $32 million, two-year deal to join the Astros.\n\nBrantley was even better this season with 22 home runs and 90 RBIs. This is the first playoffs he\u2019s been able to get past the first round, and thanks to a couple of timely hits, Brantley guaranteed the Astros will play at least two more games in this World Series.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Sports Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter: www.twitter.com/SWhyno\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Michael Brantley is healthy at the most important time and not letting that go to waste.
