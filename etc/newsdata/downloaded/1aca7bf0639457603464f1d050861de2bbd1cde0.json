The implication that thousands of race horses are dying this way \u2013 and not the tens of horses that the industry claims \u2013 must reverberate through the sector.\n\nThe predictable response from many racing people on social media last night was to explain how they love and care for retired race horses. It was the same response we saw last week, when former trainer Darren Weir was hit with animal cruelty charges, which go to court later this month.\n\nSorry, but it's just not enough.\n\nNo doubt there are many people in racing individually doing the right thing. But what\u2019s been exposed is a systemic problem that demands the industry ask systemic questions and develop systemic responses.", "description": "As one of its biggest race days approaches, the racing sector cannot ignore concerns about the brutal mistreatment of retired racehorses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2311%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b31e5752a5e3106f46f71ade3585af5bd03fcdba", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
