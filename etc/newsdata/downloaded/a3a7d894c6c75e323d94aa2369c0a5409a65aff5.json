In fact, Smith learned early on that her family was completely different from others.\n\nBut these days, Smith is determined to carve out her own identity in Hollywood. She was also personally picked by Quentin Tarantino to star in \u201cOnce Upon A Time\u2026 in Hollywood\u201d alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie.\n\nBOB CRANE\u2019S SON SLAMS \u2018HOGAN\u2019S HEROES\u2019 REBOOT IN THE WORKS: \u2018LEAVE IT ALONE\u2019\n\n'SAVED BY THE BELL' STAR TIFFANI THIESSEN EXPLAINS WHY SHE\u2019S NOT RETURNING FOR REBOOT\n\nSmith spoke to Fox News about being directed by Kevin, 49, the star who surprised her the most on the set of \u201cJay and Silent Bob Reboot,\u201d impressing Tarantino, 56, and what she really thinks of Robbie, 29, playing Harley Quinn.\n\nFox News: Growing up, when did you realize that your dad was different from other dads?\n\nHarley Quinn Smith: I guess when he made \"Red State.\" Our family started to receive a lot of death threats and it was kind of terrifying. And my parents never wanted to scare me, so they were kind of always just like, \"No, it's fine, it's fine.\" But then I found out later down the line that that movie made a lot of people upset and then I kind of, with all that happening, I was like, \"Oh yeah, no, our family is not very normal.\" We have a very different life than other people.\n\nFox News: What can audiences expect from \u201cJay and Silent Bob Reboot\u201d?\n\nSmith: Audiences can expect that it is the same vibe as the first one for sure \u2014 very, very similar. But this one is surprisingly emotional, which I don't really think many audience members are going to anticipate because the first one is very much not that. But the father-daughter relationship that takes place in this film really does add an aspect of emotion and depth to it.\n\n\u2018DALLAS\u2019 STAR PATRICK DUFFY CREDITS \u2018MAN FROM ATLANTIS\u2019 FOR HELPING HIM NAB ROLE OF BOBBY EWING\n\nELTON JOHN HIJACKED ROLLING STONES CONCERT HIGH ON COCAINE; KEITH RICHARDS WAS NOT HAPPY\n\nFox News: What was it about the character that made you want to get involved?\n\nSmith: I don't think I had a choice to be involved in the film. If I didn't my dad would probably disown me. But also on my own choice I do really love the film, so I'm very thankful to be a part of it. I play a character named Milly, or Millennium Faulken, and she is the daughter of Justice (Shannon Elizabeth) and Jay (Mewes). She discovers that Jay is her father throughout the film, but she grew up without a father so she's very badass for sure.\n\nShe has a very tough shell because she has grown up with an absent parent, so she does kind of have this armor to her to kind of protect herself because she does have this emotional hole in her life. But underneath that, she is very deeply emotional and very heartfelt, and she has been longing for a father her whole life.\n\nSo meeting Jay absolutely changes everything for her... She's the toughest character I've ever played. She has an extreme attitude to her, which I love. It's my favorite part about her.\n\nJUDY GARLAND\u2019S DAUGHTER SAYS STAR WOULD HAVE LIVED LONGER IF IT WEREN\u2019T FOR THE \u2018STIGMA\u2019 SURROUNDING ADDICTION\n\nROGER MOORE\u2019S SON GEOFFREY SAYS LATE ACTOR LEFT JAMES BOND FRANCHISE AT THE RIGHT TIME\n\nFox News: Who would you say surprised you the most on set and why?\n\nSmith: I mean, like everybody else, I was the most surprised about Ben Affleck because he used to a be huge part of my family's life and he hadn't been in our lives for many years. So the fact that he and my dad reconciled and rebuilt their relationship was kind of a shock to everybody.\n\nIt's a huge shock to me. I haven't seen him since I was so small. So to see him again, I was like, \"Oh yeah.\" So he was a huge surprise. I was very excited about Craig Robinson, who I never actually got to meet, but I was so stoked about him because I love \"The Office.\"\n\nFox News: What\u2019s it like as an actress to be directed by your dad?\n\nSmith: It\u2019s not very different working with my dad compared to other directors because he doesn't treat me differently than any other actor, which is my preference. I wouldn't want him to. So there is the aspect that we are automatically much closer than I would be with any director. So with that in mind, we do kind of have more fun from the get-go because there's a level of comfort that is already there. But it doesn't differ much from working with any other director otherwise.\n\n\u2018I DREAM OF JEANNIE\u2019 STAR BARBARA EDEN RECALLS THE LAST TIME SHE SAW LARRY HAGMAN: \u2018HE DIDN\u2019T LOOK SICK\u2019\n\n\u2018GILLIGAN\u2019S ISLAND\u2019 STAR TINA LOUISE SHARES HOW THE SHOW 'REPRESENTED THIS GREAT ESCAPE'\n\nFox News: You\u2019ve previously mentioned that despite growing up in the entertainment industry, you wanted to carve out your own identity and make it on your terms.\n\nSmith: Absolutely. It\u2019s more important to me than anything else that I prove myself to everybody that I have a right to be here just as much as everybody else, and I deserve to be here. Just because my dad is in the entertainment industry doesn't mean that I can't be as well. And I'm very thankful because I had my foot in the door through him, but I've had to work just as hard as everybody else.\n\nCHRISTIE BRINKLEY RECREATES HER 'GIRL IN THE RED FERRARI' MOMENT FROM 'NATIONAL LAMPOON\u2019S VACATION'\n\nI did have my foot in the door, but I have had a whole different set of things that I've had to work towards, like proving myself and working twice as hard just to kind of again prove to people that I am talented in my own right. I'm not just the daughter of somebody famous, I am my own person with my own set of talents and skills. So although I am so lucky to have had his help with my entrance into this business, I do have to work very, very hard just to show everybody and to convince them that I do deserve to be here on my own right, my own merit.\n\nFox News: Is it true you were personally picked by Quentin Tarantino to appear in \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\"?\n\nSmith: I\u2019m pretty sure everybody was personally picked *laughs* but yeah. I auditioned for it early in 2018 and all the girls going out for the Manson family all auditioned for the same part. And so then probably a week or a month later I found out I didn't get that part. I was so bummed.\n\nLUCILLE BALL ENDURED RUTHLESS CRITICISM ON \u2018LIFE WITH LUCY,\u2019 SAYS CO-STAR: \u2018THEY WERE SO BLOODY\u2019\n\n'ROOM 222' STAR KAREN VALENTINE RECALLS 'AWFUL' ENCOUNTER AFTER 'THE DATING GAME'\n\n... And then probably three months later I got a call that was like, \"Quentin wants you in the movie.\" And I was like, \"No, what? ... No, he doesn't.\" And then it happened to be the truth. It was the greatest shock of my life, absolutely, but also the best news I have ever received.\n\nFox News: What was it like being on that set?\n\nSmith: It\u2019s the greatest gift I've ever been given to be able to watch somebody that I've looked up to for so long and just watch them do their thing and watch a master at his craft. I aspire to be a filmmaker myself and to be able to watch somebody and observe them do what they're so incredible at was an insane gift.\n\nIt felt like I was in a much better version of school because I learned more than I probably ever have in my life, just watching him in action. Watching him do his thing and getting to see the way he processes things and his thought process, it was really such a gift that I feel so lucky for.\n\n'FAMILY MATTERS' STAR JALEEL WHITE REVEALS HOW HE FEELS ABOUT STEVE URKEL TODAY, ESCAPING CHILD STAR CURSE\n\n\u2018BUCK ROGERS\u2019 STAR ERIN GRAY SAYS SHE WAS INITIALLY \u2018SCARED TO DEATH\u2019 OF PLAYING COL. WILMA DEERING\n\nFox News: How would you describe your band the tenth?\n\nSmith: \u2026 We are a bubblegum punk band. That's the genre that we have claimed for ourselves. I play bass and I am one of the co-vocalists. We're really inspired by Hole and Sleater-Kinney, but our inspirations are... all over the map. And we started the band about a year and a half ago. It's become one of the greatest parts of my life.\n\n... I have no idea how I lived without making music for that long because when I was in middle school I started playing bass. And then I kind of stopped for about four years, all throughout high school. And so there was just kind of this huge gap in my life that I didn't really realize until I picked bass back up... So to be able to pick it back up again and create with my friends was just so great and such an amazing addition to my life that I can't wait to keep making more music.\n\nEDIE ADAMS\u2019 SON EXPLAINS WHY HER LATE HUSBAND ERNIE KOVACS IS SEEMINGLY FORGOTTEN IN HOLLYWOOD\n\n\u2018LEAVE IT TO BEAVER\u2019 STAR TONY DOW EXPLAINS WHY HE WASN\u2019T ALLOWED TO WATCH HIT SERIES GROWING UP\n\nFox News: What do you think of Margot Robbie's portrayal as Harley Quinn?\n\nSmith: I think there's been a huge build-up and wave for the comic book community to see what a live-action Harley Quinn would look like. And for me personally, Margot Robbie fulfilled everything I could have ever wanted in a Harley Quinn. I don't think there's anyone better suited for it, and she's such an insanely talented human being and actor and producer. I am obsessed with her. I think she's just the absolute coolest. And so for me personally as a comic book fan and nerd, she does it for me and I can't wait to see \"Birds of Prey.\" I think that's going to be absolutely phenomenal.", "description": "Harley Quinn Smith made her debut as an actress when she was just 1 year old in 2001\u2019s \u201cJay and Silent Bob Strike Back\u201d as baby Silent Bob \u2014\u00a0and now the 20-year-old is returning to the film franchise for a completely different role.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/15/694940094001_6095054395001_6095049679001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
