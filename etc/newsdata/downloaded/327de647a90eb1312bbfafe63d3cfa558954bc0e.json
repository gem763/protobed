There are basically two types of interest fixed and floating. Under the fixed home loan, the interest rate does not vary over the fixed tenure. But in the case of floating home loan is calculated according to MCLR and several other changes that depict a fall in the interest rate.\n\nInsurance\n\nWhile availing a home loan make sure you are getting the home insurance along with it. You must insure your home. By paying a nominal premium for your home insurance policy, you will be securing your home against unwanted emergencies.

Generally, banks prefer to offer shorter repayment duration. Shorter duration is also beneficial as it reduced the interest burden. With short duration, EMIs will increase but it will help you in reducing the cost of home loan\n\nEMIs\n\nEMI is the amount that you pay monthly to return the loan amount to the bank. It depends on the loan tenure and down payment of the home as well. More the down payment, the lesser will be the EMI. It is advisable to make sure that the loan amount should not exceed 45 percent of your total income.\n\nForeclosure Norms\n\nWhile availing any loan, it is important to go through the foreclosure norms. Like when you will be able to close the loan and how much will be the charges of foreclosure and much more. Banks normally charge for repaying the home loans before the tenure ends. In case of a floating home loan interest rate, the bank will not charge any foreclosure penalty.\n\nKeep the above-mentioned points in your mind before availing a home loan.
