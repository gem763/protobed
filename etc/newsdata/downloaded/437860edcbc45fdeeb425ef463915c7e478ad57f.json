Instead the emphasis is on \u2018energy security\u2019 with less reliance on foreign states and gas imports expected to rise as North Sea reserves run down.\n\nThe NAO said fracking has proved costly for local authorities and police forces, which manage protests at the sites.\n\nThe report estimated that at least \u00a332.7million has been spent by public bodies since 2011, although the full costs are not known.\n\nA combined bill of \u00a313.4million has been picked up by Lancashire Constabulary, North Yorkshire Police and Nottinghamshire Police.\n\nThe NAO said public support for fracking was lower than for other energy sources and has fallen over time.\n\nThe Government attributes the slow progress of fracking to low public acceptance.\n\nConcern about fracking operations centres around greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater pollution and fracking-induced earthquakes.\n\nThe report says landowners may be liable for the decommissioning costs of sites should an operator be unable to cover them \u2013 but arrangements are \u2018unclear and untested\u2019.\n\nRebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u2019s business and energy spokesman, condemned the fracking industry. \u2018The Tory-Lib Dem coalition and now the Tory government have wasted millions pushing an industry that is unpopular across the UK and fiercely opposed locally,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018Fracking threatens air and water quality, and it contributes to the climate crisis. And, as this report reveals, the Government\u2019s plan for making fracking sites safe after they\u2019ve been used is unclear and untested.\n\n\u2018Well let me be crystal clear, Labour will ban fracking immediately.\u2019\n\nThe NAO said the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy felt that climate change objectives could be met while developing fracking, but that the necessary technology was not yet ready.\n\nJamie Peters, fracking campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u2018This is a quietly critical report that doesn\u2019t give the fracking industry any revived sense of hope.\n\n\u2018The NAO have several concerns including the mark-your-own-homework approach to regulation and the lack of clarity over who should be responsible for clean-up costs if fracking ever got going.\n\n\u2018Nothing has changed: fracking isn\u2019t wanted, it\u2019s a failed industry, and the future is renewables and energy saving.\u2019", "description": "David Cameron's government had predicted the development of a \u00a333billion industry with 64,500 jobs with 20 frackign wells operational by mid 2020.", "authors": ["Colin Fernadez For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/01/20062800-0-image-a-78_1571790849266.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
