The other included cars used by Biegun when he met Swedish officials at the Foreign Ministry on Friday.\n\nThe delegation from North Korea, which is under sanctions banning much of its trade due to its nuclear programme, arrived in Sweden on Thursday after Pyongyang unexpectedly announced this week that talks would take place on Oct. 5.\n\nA spokesman for the Swedish Foreign Ministry, which has so far not confirmed anything about the talks, declined to comment.\n\nAnalysts have said the leaders of both countries face growing incentives to reach a deal, although it is unclear whether common ground can be found after months of tension and deadlock.\n\nOnly a day after announcing the resumption of talks, North Korea said it had test-fired a new ballistic missile designed for submarine launch, a provocative gesture that also underscored the need for Washington to move quickly to negotiate limits on Pyongyang's growing arsenal.
