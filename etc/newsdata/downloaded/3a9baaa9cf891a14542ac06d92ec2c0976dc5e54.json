Elliott Morris (@gelliottmorris) September 4, 2019\n\nGranted, granted, that\u2019s a bad poll for Harris and a good one for Gabbard. The latter is averaging 1.6 percent at RCP and seldom edges north of two percent. Harris, meanwhile, touched 10 percent as recently as last week in a poll from Emerson. But don\u2019t let that result blind you to just how far she\u2019s fallen. She\u2019s now averaging a mere 6.6 percent in all polling and has sunk to five percent (or worse!) multiple times in the past month before today. She\u2019s easily the biggest disappointment in the Democratic race to date.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s unlikely Gabbard will pass her soon given that Harris made the cut for the next debate and Gabbard didn\u2019t, it seems possible that Andrew Yang will. He\u2019ll be onstage with Harris at the debate; he\u2019s polled at three percent repeatedly over the past month, on par with Cory Booker; and his Big Idea, universal basic income, has attracted grassroots interest. He\u2019ll stand out more at the debate this time too because the number of people onstage will be smaller and will consist mostly of serious candidates. If he has a good night, what reason is there to think he won\u2019t bounce out to six percent or so, past Harris?\n\nAnd so the mystery of her dismal performance deepens. She\u2019s young, smart, a woman, a minority, enjoys the prestige of a Senate seat and can claim to represent America\u2019s most populous state. She should be appealing to Democratic voters. Why isn\u2019t she? A consensus is forming among the commentariat that she\u2019s a bit too slippery on policy to capture anyone\u2019s imagination, which I think is basically right.\n\n\u201cToo flippy-floppy. I just don\u2019t like her,\u201d said Debby Fisher of Richmond, California \u2014 near Harris\u2019s hometown of Oakland \u2014 who plans to support Sanders. Suzanne Cowan of San Francisco said she soured on Harris after her change on health care. \u201cThat\u2019s not my kind of candidate. Either you know what issues you support and you have the courage to stand up for them or you don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me she\u2019s \u2018I\u2019ll be in favor of whatever is trending\u2019 \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Her Brilliance, Her Passion\u2019 Patrick Kollar of Roy, Washington, who recently attended a Warren rally in Seattle, said he\u2019s unsure how to define Harris ideologically. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI follow politics pretty closely and I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s about.\u201d\n\nThere are two models (and potentially a third) for a Democratic nominee in 2020. One is the Vision candidate, the person who recognizes that America needs major changes in all sorts of ways and is intent on delivering it. That\u2019s Bernie and Warren. The other is the Electable candidate, the person who can achieve job one as far as most Democratic voters are concerned, which is ousting Trump. That\u2019s Biden, of course. The third potential model is the Charisma candidate, the person who gets everyone irrationally excited because they\u2019re just *that* good on the stump. Obama 2008 is the classic example; a surprise entry by Oprah into the race would also fill the niche. No one\u2019s really filling it now \u2014 the closest thing is Warren, who\u2019s drawing enthusiastic crowds, but even she\u2019s not at the level of hype that Betomania! achieved in Texas last year before O\u2019Rourke took his show on the road.\n\nHarris\u2019s problem is that she doesn\u2019t fit any of the three models. Lord knows she\u2019s not a Vision candidate. To the contrary, her approach to health care seems driven by how best to triangulate between the left and the center to maximize vote totals. She\u2019s not a Charisma candidate either. She\u2019s polished and effective in making her points, as Biden found out at the first debate, but there\u2019ll be no messianic Harris buzz like there was for Obama and Trump. That leaves the Electability model, and she does have some potential there \u2014 as a black woman she\u2019s a logical possibility to reassemble the Obama coalition from 2008 and sweep to victory. But Democrats have been haunted for months by the suspicion that only an older white guy can blunt Trump\u2019s edge with the white working class and pull enough Rust Belt votes away from him to win. There\u2019s a case to be made that, however unfair the reasons, Harris might be less electable than Bernie or Warren, say. As Dem voters mull all of that, go figure that they might gravitate to alternatives.", "description": "Officer down.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kh.jpg"}
