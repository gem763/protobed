Many of the groups have pushed back on the proposal, saying most efforts by the U.S. government to intervene in online speech will amount to a violation of the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cAlthough we understand that some organizations may have some remaining reservations, the Chairman believes that advancing the legislation in Committee ... is an important first step to making online platforms more secure against domestic and international terrorism while promoting free speech and innovation on the internet,\u201d a committee spokesman told The Hill last week.\n\nThe tension highlights the enormous challenges facing lawmakers concerned about violence inspired by white supremacist attitudes, which are often incubated and spread online. While there are several fringe networks known as breeding grounds for neo-Nazis and white extremists, many of the top proponents of those attitudes maintain profiles on top social networks like Facebook and Twitter. And critics say the Silicon Valley giants reward inflammatory content through an emphasis on attracting attention and interaction.", "description": "A House panel on Wednesday voted to advance a bill aimed at combating the scourge of extremist content online despite ongoing pushback from civil liberties groups and Republicans on the committee.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gettyimages-935631506_copy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
