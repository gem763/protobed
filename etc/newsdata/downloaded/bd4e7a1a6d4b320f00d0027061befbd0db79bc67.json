It\u2019s a great way to voice that connection to the world,\" he said.\n\nThe 2020 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony will take place May 2 at Cleveland's Public Auditorium.\n\nThe Rock Hall finally got it right \u2013 thanks to its legendary 2019 class\n\nContributing: Bill Keveney\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/17/rock-hall-2020-fan-vote-leaderboard/4006694002/", "description": "According to the Rock and\u00a0Roll Hall of Fame's freshly unveiled leaderboard, these artists have acquired the most fan votes.", "authors": ["Erin Jensen", "Published P.M.
