(AP) - Lukas Michel of Australia twice came back from 3-hole deficits Thursday and won the U.S. Mid-Amateur, becoming the first international winner in the event\u2019s 39-year history and earning a spot in the Masters.\n\nMichel had a 1-up lead over Joseph Deraney after four holes in the 36-hole championship match at Colorado Golf Club. That was the last time he led until a birdie on the 33rd hole in the afternoon. Michel went 2 up with another birdie on the par-5 16th, and polished off a 2-and-1 victory with a par on No. 17.\n\nThe Masters offers an invitation to the U.S. Mid-Amateur champion.\n\nThe 25-year-old Michel was the third Australian to reach a USGA final this year.
