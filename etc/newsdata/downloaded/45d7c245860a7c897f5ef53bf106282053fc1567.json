Reuters\n\n\"I last visited Julian in August - he was a bit shaky, and is suffering from anxiety. He has lost a lot of weight. It is very distressing, and the intensity of his treatment has increased over the past year.\n\n\"He is being subjected to every sort of torment.\"\n\nMr Assange was arrested at the London\u2019s Ecuadorian embassy in April, having sought asylum in the building for seven years.\n\nHe is wanted on 18 charges in the US, including violation of the espionage act.\n\nMany of the charges relate to founding and working at WikiLeaks - which openly published sensitive and classified documents, including more than a million files leaked by US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.\n\nHis removal from the embassy also triggered renewed calls for him to stand trial in Sweden \u2013 with the nation\u2019s government reopening the case into Mr Assange over allegations of rape made in 2010.\n\nHowever, Sweden\u2019s call to extradite him was rejected by courts in the country, delaying any potential action and prompting home secretary Sajid Javid to approve the request of the US government pending his trial.\n\nHuman rights organisations have raised concerns over the duration of Assange\u2019s incarceration, including his time spent in the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he was left unable to leave for fear of arrest.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
