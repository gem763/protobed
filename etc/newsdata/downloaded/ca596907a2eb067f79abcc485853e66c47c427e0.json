REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado\n\nSANTIAGO (Reuters) - As many as a million Chileans protested peacefully late into the evening on Friday in the capital Santiago in the biggest rallies yet since violence broke out a week ago over entrenched inequality in the South American nation.\n\nProtesters waving national flags, dancing, banging pots with wooden spoons and bearing placards urging political and social change streamed through the streets, walking for miles (km) from around Santiago to converge on Plaza Italia.Traffic already hobbled by truck and taxi drivers protesting road tolls ground to a standstill in Santiago as crowds shut down major avenues and public transport closed early ahead of marches that built throughout the afternoon.\n\nBy mid-evening, most had made their way home in the dark ahead of an 11 p.m. military curfew.\n\nSantiago Governor Karla Rubilar said a million people marched in the capital - more than five percent of the country\u2019s population. Protesters elsewhere took to the streets in every major Chilean city.\n\n\u201cToday is a historic day,\u201d Rubilar wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe Metropolitan Region is host to a peaceful march of almost one million people who represent a dream for a new Chile.\u201d\n\nSome local commentators estimated the Santiago rally well over the million mark, describing it as the largest single march since the dying years of the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.\n\nChile\u2019s unrest is the latest in a flare-up of protests in South America and around the world - from Beirut to Barcelona - each with local triggers but also sharing underlying anger at social disparities and ruling elites.\n\nProtests in Chile that started over a hike in public transport fares last Friday boiled into riots, arson and looting that have killed at least 17 people, injured hundreds, resulted in more than 7,000 arrests and caused more than $1.4 billion of losses to Chilean businesses.\n\nChile\u2019s military has taken over security in Santiago, a city of 6 million people now under a state of emergency with night-time curfews as 20,000 soldiers patrol the streets.\n\nClotilde Soto, a retired teacher aged 82, said she had taken to the streets because she did not want to die without seeing change for the better in her country.\n\n\u201cAbove all we need better salaries and better pensions,\u201d she said.\n\nChile\u2019s center-right President Sebastian Pinera, a billionaire businessman, trounced the opposition in the most recent 2017 election, dealing the center-left ruling coalition its biggest loss since the country\u2019s return to democracy in 1990.\n\nBut as protests ignited this week, Pinera scrapped previous plans and promised instead to boost the minimum wage and pensions, ditch fare hikes on public transportation and fix the country\u2019s ailing health care system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all heard the message. We\u2019ve all changed,\u201d said Pinera on Twitter following the peak of the rallies. \u201cToday\u2019s joyful and peaceful march, in which Chileans have asked for a more just and unified Chile, opens hopeful paths into the future.\u201d\n\nStill, many protest placards, chants and graffiti scrawled on buildings around the city call for his exit.\n\nRelated Coverage Chile protesters block access to lithium operations - local leader\n\nMULTICOLORED CROWD\n\nAs crowds of colorful demonstrators stretched along Santiago\u2019s thoroughfares as far as the eye could see, the noise of pots and pans being clanged with spoons, a clamor that has become the soundtrack for the popular uprising, was ear-splitting.\n\n\u201cThe people, united, will never be defeated,\u201d the crowds chanted over the din.\n\nBy early evening there had been no signs of violence or clashes with the security forces, who maintained a significant but low-key presence inside paint-spattered and stone-dented armored vehicles parked in side streets.\n\nBeatriz Demur, 42, a yoga teacher from the suburb of Barrio Brazil, joined a stream of demonstrators shuffling toward Plaza Italia with her daughter Tabatha, 22.\n\n\u201cWe want Chile to be a better place,\u201d said Demur. \u201cThe most powerful have privatized everything. It\u2019s been that way for 30 years.\u201dEyeing the crowds packing the square, her daughter said: \u201cI have waited for this a long time ... It\u2019s not scary, it\u2019s exciting. It means change.\u201d\n\nAnali Parra, 26, a street hawker, was with her daughter Catalina, 9, and five-month-old son Gideon Jesus, his buggy decked in streamers and an indigenous Mapuche flag.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to go away,\u201d Parra said. \u201cPinera should just go now.\u201d\n\n\u2018URGENT\u2019 REFORMS\n\nOn Friday morning, trucks, cars and taxis had slowed to a crawl on major roads, honking horns and waving Chilean flags. \u201cNo more tolls! Enough with the abuse!\u201d read bright yellow-and-red signs plastered to the front of vehicles.\n\nMany bus drivers in Santiago also staged a walk-off on Friday after one of their number was shot.\n\nWhile much of wealthy east Santiago has remained calm under evening lockdown, the poorer side of the city has seen widespread vandalism and looting.\n\nPinera told the nation on Thursday he had heard the demands of Chileans \u201cloud and clear.\u201d\n\nHe has sent lawmakers legislation to overturn a recent hike in electricity rates, and called for reforms to guarantee a minimum wage of $480 a month and introduce state medical insurance for catastrophes. [nL2N2760H6]\n\nSeated with a group of elderly Chileans over lunch on Friday, Pinera put finishing touches on a bill to hike minimum pensions by 20%. \u201cWe must approve these projects with the urgency that Chileans demand,\u201d Pinera said.\n\nLawmakers pushing the reforms forward were nonetheless forced to evacuate the country\u2019s Congress in the port city of Valparaiso earlier in the day when angry protesters rushed the building, overwhelming security forces.\n\nSlideshow (23 Images)\n\nAn online poll conducted by local company Activa Research of 2,090 people between Oct. 22-23 found 83% of respondents said they supported the goals of the demonstrators, but 72.5% opposed violence as a method of protest.\n\nThe principal causes of the protests were low salaries, high utility prices, poor pensions and economic inequality, it said.", "description": "As many as a million Chileans protested peacefully late into the evening on Friday in the capital Santiago in the biggest rallies yet since violence broke out a week ago over entrenched inequality in the South American nation.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445064778&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P03D", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
