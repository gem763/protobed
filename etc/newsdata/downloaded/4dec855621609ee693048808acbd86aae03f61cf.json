My head is held high and I am so proud.\n\nMichael felt it was his time for him to go (Picture: Channel 4)\n\n\u2018In the technical my Cassatelles exploded \u2013 and had the dreaded soggy bottom. And even though I spiced up my showstopper with rum for my Jamaican Mule Sarawak, it didn\u2019t impress the judges enough to keep me in the tent.\u2019\n\nElsewhere Henry had a great day at the office as he got a Hollywood Handshake from judge Paul Hollywood for his signature bake.\n\nPaul was full of praise as he said: \u2018I think your flavours are good. The proving\u2019s good, the colour\u2019s good, the technique\u2019s good.\u2019\n\nNot wanting to be overly nice, he added: \u2018Yeah my only gripe is the size difference. But nevertheless\u2026\u2019\n\nHe then extended his hand to Henry to give him one of his coveted Hollywood handshakes.\n\nHenry was stunned and blurted out: \u2018No\u2026shut up.\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think you say \u201cshut up\u201d to the judges\u2019 Prue joked.\n\nPresenter Noel Fielding said: \u2018No one\u2019s ever told a handshake to shut up\u2019.\n\nDespite his blunder in front of the judges, Henry was pleased with how his signature bake went, explaining: \u2018I could go now. I could leave this week and be happy with that.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaul didn\u2019t let the \u2018shut up\u2019 thing go and brought it up during a discussion with Prue, Noel and Sandi Toksvig before the next round.\n\nThe chef even got a chance to fire the words back at Henry towards the end of the episode when the baker brought his festival box up for judging.\n\nThe Great British Bake Off airs Tuesdays at 8pm on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
