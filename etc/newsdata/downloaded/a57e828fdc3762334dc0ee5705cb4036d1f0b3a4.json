Analysts expect her to be calling the shots if, as polls suggest, the populist left comes back to power.\n\nDespite some last-minute momentum in the final weeks of the campaign of center-right Argentine President Mauricio Macri, his populist predecessor remains the odds-on favorite to emerge triumphant, a reflection of the Macri government\u2019s inability to deliver on many of its economic promises.\n\nThe Fernandez-Fernandez ticket resoundingly defeated Mr. Macri in the Aug. 11 national primaries and could rack up such a large plurality Sunday \u2014 45% of the overall vote, or least 40% with no rival within 10 percentage points \u2014 to avoid a runoff next month.\n\nAfter his 16-point primary defeat triggered a 30% drop in the value of the Argentine peso, Mr. Macri, a former businessman who once made deals with developer Donald Trump, made things worse by seeming to blame voters for \u201creturning to the past, [which] the world views as the end of Argentina.\u201d\n\nAfter insisting he felt their pain amid a prolonged recession, Mr. Macri decreed tax freezes and price controls to win back a disenchanted middle class. Under the motto \u201cYes, we can,\u201d he held massive rallies and marches across the nation.\n\nThe incumbent was widely judged the winner of the second televised presidential debate Sunday. He highlighted the checkered legacy of Ms. Fernandez, whose two terms were marked by repeated corruption scandals and a government funding crisis.\n\n\u201cThis week \u2026 Alberto Fernandez told the truth for the first time in the campaign: \u2018Cristina and I are the same,\u2019\u201d Mr. Macri said. \u201c[Their] problem is how to hide that.\u201d\n\nEconomic decline\n\nAlthough the comeback of Mr. Macri\u2019s predecessor divides Argentines, the economic situation is proving too dire for him to outmaneuver the grand coalition of formerly fractured Peronists the Fernandezes, sociologist Marcos Novaro said.\n\nDespite Mr. Macri\u2019s reputation as an economic manager, the peso\u2019s value fell and poverty and inflation rates soared during his term. Argentina\u2019s national credit rating has been downgraded, and the International Monetary Fund last year approved the largest bailout package in its nearly 75-year history: a $57 billion for the faltering Argentine economy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s tried very hard; Macri maintained his competitiveness,\u201d Mr. Novaro said. \u201c[But] a majority has already accepted that the Peronists will return to government.\u201d\n\nEven Mr. Macri\u2019s longtime supporters, such as La Nacion columnist Joaquin Morales Sola, no longer share the president\u2019s optimism.\n\n\u201cMacri underestimated Cristina: She liquidated him,\u201d Mr. Morales Sola said. \u201cMacri\u2019s page has already been passed. Page turned.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. Fernandez is sworn in as president on Dec. 10 as expected, the columnist added, he will likely be highly dependent on Ms. Fernandez and the \u201cdisciplined\u201d lawmakers of her La Campora youth organization who \u2014 unlike his state-level allies \u2014 won\u2019t ask for pork out of empty federal coffers.\n\n\u201cThe governors\u2019 support will cost him more than La Campora\u2019s support,\u201d Mr. Morales Sola said. \u201cThe governors will charge him for everything, and Cristina perhaps won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMr. Fernandez not only must contend with a vice president not known for playing second fiddle, but he is also inheriting her considerable political baggage.\n\nMs. Fernandez, whose 2017 election as a senator has given her immunity from arrest, is a defendant in 13 criminal probes accusing her of massive corruption and, in one case, \u201chigh treason\u201d over an alleged cover-up of Iran\u2019s involvement in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires.\n\nHer former vice president, Amado Boudou; planning minister, Julio De Vido; and public works secretary, Jose Lopez, are all serving lengthy prison terms on corruption convictions.\n\nMr. Fernandez, a lawyer who served as Ms. Fernandez\u2019s first Cabinet chief, struggled in Sunday\u2019s debate to explain how, while working at the Casa Rosada, Argentina\u2019s presidential residence, he remained unaware of the shady activity.\n\n\u201cWhen I had disagreements, I resigned and went home,\u201d the candidate said. \u201cSince I left, no judge has ever cited me to provide explanations. \u2026 I\u2019ve got nothing to do with the corruption.\u201d\n\nBase politics\n\nTo a remarkable extent, Ms. Fernandez has held on to her staunchly loyal political base, where concerns over her ongoing trials and the apparent ideological clash within her coalition are all but inadmissible.\n\n\u201cI believe there is no tension at all,\u201d Alicia Castro, Ms. Fernandez\u2019s former ambassador to Venezuela, told The Washington Times.\n\nAlthough Mr. Macri\u2019s four-year term has brought Argentina \u201chunger\u201d and \u201cmisery,\u201d Ms. Castro would not say whether the next administration should be seen as a continuation of Mr. Kirchner\u2019s and Ms. Fernandez\u2019s 2003-2015 rule.\n\nRicardo Kirschbaum, editor-in-chief of the Buenos Aires newspaper Clarin, noted that Mr. Fernandez said he does not want to make the economic mistakes of his running mate\u2019s Peronist past.\n\n\u201cHe has promised a moderate leftist government and carefully distanced himself from the radical policies of his running mate,\u201d Mr. Kirschbaum wrote in an analysis for the journal Foreign Affairs. \u201cUnlike her, he does not intend to stand up to Washington, defend Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, attack the independent media, or silence his critics.\u201d\n\nWhether Mr. Fernandez could truly embrace his running mate\u2019s past penchant to align Argentina with leftist governments in the region, though, is at best doubtful, given the Peronists\u2019 big-tent approach.\n\nFormer Cabinet Chief Sergio Massa, a longtime personal friend of President Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and a harsh critic of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, is unlikely to warm to such an idea.\n\nMr. Massa, who broke with Ms. Fernandez once before, is key to maintaining the fragile Peronist coalition that may catapult her back into power.\n\nCaught between so many pressures and variables \u2014 and stuck with an economy that seems to be in perpetual crisis \u2014 a new Fernandez administration may find itself with virtually no room to maneuver, analysts warned.\n\n\u201cNobody knows how [Mr. Fernandez] will govern,\u201d said Mr. Novaro, the sociologist. \u201cHe\u2019ll be squeezed by a ton of actors who\u2019ll have power over him.\u201d\n\nAs a consequence, Mr. Fernandez\u2019s plans for governing remain shrouded in mystery just days before the election, Mr. Morales Sola said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he going to do? Nobody knows,\u201d the columnist said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know, either.\u201d\n\nIt would be naive to believe that Mr. Macri\u2019s likely exit will somehow immunize Argentina from outbursts of public anger like the recent unrest in Ecuador and Chile, Mr. Novaro said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a situation prone to explode, and in Argentina, we\u2019re experts in explosions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the challenge for Alberto Fernandez is so enormous.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
