famously walked through a minefield has said how \u201cemotional\u201d the moment was for Harry.\n\nHalo Trust chief executive James Cowan last month accompanied Harry in Huambo, Angola, to the area where Diana, Princess of Wales took the same 50-metre stroll 22 years earlier.\n\nIn 1997, Diana strode through a cleared path in a minefield and the images of her in body armour and a mask gave the anti-landmine campaign global recognition.\n\nThe site has since been transformed into a wide residential road called Avenida 28 de Maio \u2013 but is affectionately known amongst locals as Princess Diana Street.\n\nWearing body armour, Harry visited a mine clearance site nearby and set off a controlled explosion.\n\nPrince Harry visit to HALO Angola minefield, Dirico, in September 2019 (Halo/DfID)\n\nFormer Black Watch commanding officer Mr Cowan, 55, said Harry was \u201chugely struck\u201d by the transformation in Huambo.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt was clearly an emotional visit for Prince Harry to follow in his mother\u2019s footsteps and see her legacy in Huambo first-hand.\n\n\u201cThis visit mattered a great deal to him.\n\n\u201cHe was hugely struck by the transformation in Huambo and is incredibly passionate about honouring the work started by his mother.\n\n\u201cHe is committed to helping Halo emulate in Angola what we\u2019ve achieved in Mozambique by making it mine free.\u201d\n\nMr Cowan, who joined the Scottish-based landmine clearance charity in 2015, said Harry has a \u201cgreat sense of what really matters in the world\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cI know Prince Harry a little bit from our time in the military and I\u2019ve been delighted to work with him at Halo.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s funny, he\u2019s got charisma, and he\u2019s also got a great sense of what really matters in this world.\n\n\u201cI think that is a very wonderful combination.\u201d\n\nIn 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales visited Huambo, Angola, to bring global attention to the effect of landmines on people\u2019s lives.\n\n\n\n22 years on, The Duke walked along the bustling street which was once the minefield where his mother was pictured. pic.twitter.com/r8jOsCISf1 \u2014 The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) September 27, 2019\n\nDiana never saw her work to help outlaw landmines come to fruition as she died later in the same year as her visit to Angola, a few months before the international treaty to ban the weapons was signed.\n\nHalo is a non-political charity that helps communities across the world remove the deadly devices from their land.\n\nThe Angolan government has announced 60 million US dollars (\u00a346 million) of funding to the charity to clear 153 minefields in the south-east of the country, Mr Cowan said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis new project will take us five years and combines three things that are closest to Prince Harry\u2019s heart \u2013 the humanitarian, his love of Africa, and his love of the wilderness.\n\n\u201cPrince Harry\u2019s visit has really put a focus on demining in Angola.\n\n\u201cIt will take us five years to clear these 153 minefields.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s only 153 of 1,200, so there\u2019s a lot of work ahead and money to be raised before we can totally clear Angola of deadly devices.\u201d\n\nHarry was wearing a UK Aid Match logo to help support Halo\u2019s new \u201cBreaking Boundaries\u201d campaign to raise funds to carry out its work in Zimbabwe.\n\nUK Aid Match is a scheme run by the UK Government\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID).\n\nEvery pound pledged to Halo from now until December 22 will be doubled by DfID.\n\nFather-of-three Mr Cowan, whose passing out parade was conducted by Diana, said the funding pledge will help the charity \u201cclear twice as many minefields and help twice as many people\u201d.\n\nDiana, Princess of Wales toured a minefield during a famous visit in 1997 (John Stillwell/PA)\n\nHe added: \u201cWe want to help Zimbabwe recover its reputation as the breadbasket of Africa and removing landmines will help unlock the country\u2019s potential.\n\n\u201cNow the British public can donate to the Breaking Boundaries appeal knowing that every pound they give will be doubled by the UK Government.\u201d\n\nInternational Development Secretary Alok Sharma said: \u201cLandmines are indiscriminate weapons of war that maim and kill innocent men, women and children, their devastation lasts long after conflict has ended.\n\n\u201cHalo Trust is a Scottish charity that is a world leader in demining, and I am proud that through UK Aid Match, we will double generous donations from the British public to help rid Zimbabwe of these deadly explosives.\n\n\u201cThe UK Government is deeply committed to clearing landmines in Zimbabwe and across the world, so no one has to live in fear of one wrong step.\u201d\n\nMore information can be found at www.halotrust.org/breaking-boundaries.", "description": "The Duke of Sussex saw how the area of Angola
