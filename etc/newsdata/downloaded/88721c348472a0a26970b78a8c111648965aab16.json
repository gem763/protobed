With 200,000 subscribers on YouTube, a podcast, and a popular Instagram page, the 22-year-old was earning more than her college friends with \"normal jobs\" in babysitting, bartending, and waitressing, she said.\n\n\"I think it was confusing to people in the beginning of college because I had some extra spending money from YouTube,\" she said.\n\nMiccio said she felt like she had to have a day job after graduation to feel successful. But having both an 8-to-5 day job, and dedicating time afterward to run an online business, was harder than she expected. Miccio was burnt out she said, and knew she needed a change.\n\n\"If this brings me so much joy, and I feel so much stress from having lack of time to do it, then having a day job doesn't make sense,\" she said, explaining why she ultimately left her job in sales.\n\nFrom day job to influencer career\n\nMiccio started her YouTube channel in 2011, posting videos like packing for sleepaway camp, what she got for Christmas, and high-school advice.\n\nShe continued her channel into college, filming videos in her dorm room, and in her senior year, started a podcast, \"Gals on the Go,\" with fellow University of Georgia student and YouTube creator Danielle Carolan.\n\nShortly after posting weekly episodes, they signed with the major podcast network \"Podcast One.\" Miccio records weekly episodes with Carolan, working with Podcast One and a graphic designer on branding and development.\n\nRead more: Lizzy Capri quit her day job at LinkedIn to become a YouTube creator and amassed 3.9 million subscribers in less than 2 years. She told us how.\n\nThey expanded the podcast to a private Facebook Group (11,900 members), a small community of like-minded teens, and she said she spends about an hour every day interacting with the community on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nWhen she was still at her day job, Miccio said she would spend an extra 20 hours a week working on her influencer business after work.\n\n\"It's hours here and there,\" she said. \"Three hours on a Sunday morning to reply to comments, post a video, post on Instagram. The hours add up, but I absolutely loved it and in my head I don't even see it as work.\"\n\nBut there's a lot more to an influencer career than what you seen online, she said.\n\nFrom conception, filming, editing, and promoting, YouTube creators do it all. Before she posts, she'll think about what the title, the tags, and \"metadata,\" will be that will ultimately help the video perform well and reach the right audience, she said.\n\nSince leaving her day job, Miccio has hired two part-time assistants (college students in Boston) to help her take photos and run errands. She's purchased a coworking space membership, which she said will function as an office and as a place to network.\n\nEarning money online\n\nWithout giving a specific amount, Miccio said she \"earns a comparable amount online\" to the day job she had in sales.\n\nWhen she announced she'd be leaving her day job, she said people were mostly concerned about her finances and how she would continue to support herself.\n\nBut now that Miccio is a full-time influencer, she said she earns her money through brand sponsorships, YouTube AdSense, podcast ads, and merchandise sales. Miccio is managed by Slash MGMT and has a talent manager who assists her with securing brand sponsorships and other business opportunities.\n\nShe received a degree in marketing with a digital emphasis from Georgia and said it isn't going to waste. She said having a degree in marketing has helped her understand how to better market her content to a specific audience, and scale her brand.\n\n\"This is a career nowadays,\" she said. \"And it shouldn't be a shameful thing to be an influencer. It's an awkward thing to discuss but I think five, 10 years from now we are going to see a lot more people opting for things like this.\"\n\nFor more on how influencers are profiting from their success online, according to industry professionals and creators, check out these Business Insider Prime posts:", "description": "YouTube creator Brooke Miccio shares why she left her day job in sales to focus on being an influencer fulltime.", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9f9245cc4a0a16db001628?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
