Dry heat, baking fiercely on Dolomitic limestone, has a metallic tang: salt and rock and no oxygen to spare. Autumnal East Anglian mist is damp blanket and soil: flavours at once stifling and yet muffled. Mist in a northern pine forest is altogether different again: like drinking Christmas, but without the anticipated warmth of the festive season.\n\nThere are other things that tickle the taste buds unasked: the peaty detritus left smeared across your face after a full-length slide off a wet pathway; blood sucked from fingers left mutilated by an ill-placed grab at what turns out to be a thick-as-your arm bramble. Not all flavours are imposed by external forces or missteps, though.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The snacks and energy sweets that are stuffed carelessly into jacket pockets; the sandwiches that are wrapped delicately in waterproof pouches; the cafes or pubs that are meticulously built into route-planning.\n\nIcy water that flows a luminescent blue in glacial streams and is so cold in the throat it takes the breath away\n\nWhen I think of the many miles I\u2019ve hiked over the years, it is notable to the point of embarrassment how often food or drink plays a central role in my memories. The gritstone edges of the Peak District mean Kendal Mint Cake and cream cheese sandwiches \u2013 which is odd, because the cream cheese obsession was short-lived, yet evidently potent.\n\nMeanwhile, the Austrian Tyrol is all about Milka chocolate \u2013 a large slab in its purple wrapper, bought in the early morning when there was still a sufficient chill in the area to guard against melting, the bar to be shared between the four of us (me, my brother, mum and dad) on those family holidays when mountains were clambered without a care.\n\nAs for Hadrian\u2019s Wall, the overriding taste memory is of Timothy Taylor\u2019s Dark Mild, discovered in a pub somewhere near Gilsland, where cool shade and beer threw us off track. For a long period in my twenties, I made a point of travelling light \u2013 never taking any food aside from fruit (fresh apples and bananas, and dried apricots) and Mars bars.\n\nIn normal life, I would rarely if ever buy a Mars: working at a desk requires a Twix or a Kit Kat, something with a bit of snap, a bit of crunch. But halfway up a Scottish mountain, or shrouded in Lake District fog, the effortless, soft sugar hit of a Mars is unmatchable.\n\nIt is said, quite rightly, that we should not speak while eating. But to savour the true flavour of a long trek, we should never worry about walking with our mouths full.", "description": "What does a walk taste like? It might depend on the weather.
