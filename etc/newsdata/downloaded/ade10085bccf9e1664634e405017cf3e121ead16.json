They would also have exchanged unsecured debt for secured debt.\n\nPG&E and several of its large shareholders, including Abrams Capital Management and Anchorage Capital Group among others, opposed the bondholders' initial plan.\n\nThursday's filing also said the committee's plan - the third proposed overall - would cover payments for so-called subrogation claims by insurers.\n\nPG&E recently unveiled an $11 billion settlement with insurance companies over payments they made to individuals and businesses with coverage for wildfire damage to property. The insurers had initially pegged their claims at $20 billion.
