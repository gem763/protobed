Democrats are still clinging nostalgically to the Warren Court era, and think of the courts as an institution that is on our side, and that, left to their own devices, can generally be trusted to do the right thing.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh last year was a wake-up call, so much so that Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez was among those who spoke to a Demand Justice event aimed at circulating ideas for reclaiming the judiciary. In October, Demand Justice will join the Women\u2019s March and the Center for Popular Democracy for a protest marking the anniversary of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, to make clear that conservative judges pose a substantial threat to reproductive freedom. Fallon believes that while anti-choice rulings and other conservative legal victories will pose short-term setbacks, they may ultimately build the momentum for reform.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs more and more Democratic priorities become casualties of this conservative takeover of the courts, I think it\u2019ll wake up the progressive grassroots,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re just trying to hasten that timetable so that we can confront it sooner rather than later. And in light of what the Republicans have been able to do, we no longer think that it\u2019ll be enough to just win the next election and guarantee the opportunity to appoint some judges in 2021. Trump has now left a lasting legacy and he\u2019s in the midst of flipping a bunch of the circuit courts. And just replacing some retiring democratic appointed judges will be the equivalent of treading water.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile ideas such as packing or remaking the Supreme Court still reside well outside the political mainstream, ending the practice of gerrymandering has been a project of broad public interest for some time. That project gained a prominent new advocate in 2016, when it was announced that Obama Attorney General Eric Holder would chair the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC), an effort to unwind the gerrymandered districts that have advantaged Republicans in Washington and at the state legislative level.\n\n\n\nSaumya Narechania, director of advocacy and campaign manager for the NDRC\u2019s affiliated 501(c)(4) campaign, All On The Line, argues that inertia on high-profile issues with broad public support, like gun control, has driven Democrats toward taking redistricting reform more seriously.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven though a huge majority of Americans want something like universal background checks, you\u2019ve got incumbents who look at a possible check coming in from the gun lobby and running against a possible primary challenger instead of actually looking to the general election,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the problem of gerrymandering is fundamentally a problem of allowing special interest influence and also a problem of politicians more or less being able to keep the power at the expense not just of the voter, but of the issues that voters really care about on a day-to-day basis.\u201d\n\n\n\nVoters appear to be catching on, and have successfully challenged such gerrymanders at the ballot box. \u201dLast year you\u2019ve got ballot measures that were passed in Michigan and in Ohio and in Utah, places that are purple states and red states,\u201d Narechania said. \u201cVoters are already tuned in on the issue of redistricting, and passing those ballot reforms I think was a key first step. Now, looking ahead to 2021, I think what we want to do is engage in active grassroots efforts and give them the knowledge, the tools, and the skills necessary to engage their elected officials and engage the process.\u201d\n\n\n\nEducating and engaging ordinary voters on complicated structural reform proposals, which compete for attention with bread-and-butter matters like the state of the economy and health-care reform, can be challenging. FairVote, a nonpartisan group pushing electoral reforms has been at it since 1992. The organization\u2019s president, Rob Richie, believes that the most valuable lessons for reformist organizers can be learned from FairVote\u2019s efforts at the state and local level. In Massachusetts, FairVote has worked alongside groups like Voter Choice Massachusetts to build support for ranked choice voting, a system in which voters can select and rank multiple candidates, who can win only by securing a true majority of the vote. The idea is now backed by by 41 percent of Massachusetts\u2019 state legislators.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve made it really easy for you to do something,\u201d Richie said of Massachusetts organizers. \u201cThey narrowed the ask. Let\u2019s just start educating our neighbors about this. Have some house parties. They created a really straightforward PowerPoint of what the problems were and how ranked choice voting addresses it, boiled it down to a nice, simple story that spoke to some real things going on in Massachusetts that weren\u2019t unique\u2014it\u2019s not particularly broken in Massachusetts, but there were still good, good stories to tell.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe task of making structural and procedural reforms accessible for the average voter might come easily for Indivisible, which first came to prominence with a Tea Party\u2013inspired guide to congressional activism made freely available online. \u201cOur DNA is being congressional nerds who try to demystify complex processes,\u201d Levin said. \u201cThat was the whole point of the original Indivisible Guide\u2014to say, \u2018Hey, Congress is a black box. It\u2019s hard to understand unless you\u2019re a well-paid lobbyist. Here\u2019s the basics that you need to know.\u2019 So explaining the filibuster, its role in American history and the barrier it presents to any kind of progressive change after Trump is a kind of a natural part of our wheelhouse.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe started developing a curriculum for a national gathering that we put together,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis was at the beginning of last month\u2014we had around 300 local Indivisible groups from somewhere around 40 states and D.C. And we did a training on structural reforms to democracy and a training on the filibuster in particular, and trained these groups from all across the country on how they should be engaging with presidential candidates now and what kind of questions they should be asking them.\u201d\n\n\n\nThose activists, now dispersed around the country, are working to ensure that the filibuster, already being raised as an issue by voters on the primary campaign trail, remains in the political conversation through the general election.\n\n\n\nHowever, recent polling suggests that voters are wary of major reforms to the Senate. A Pew survey from last year, for instance, found that over 60 percent of Americans are fine with the power Senate apportionment gives to less populous states. Similar polling on the filibuster yields more ambiguous data and, predictably, tends to fluctuate among partisans depending on which party controls the White House and Congress. In 2017, ahead of Mitch McConnell\u2019s elimination of the Supreme Court filibuster to confirm Neil Gorsuch, Quinnipiac found that 67 percent of voters, including 86 percent of Democrats, opposed the move. But in 2010, the last time the Democrats held both Congress and the White House, Quinnipiac found that while a 51 percent majority of voters considered eliminating the filibuster a bad idea, 54 percent of Democrats supported it.\n\n\n\nIn general, Democrats in surveys tend to express respect for bipartisanship and a preference for achieving change by consensus. For instance, ahead of the 2016 election, Pew found that 66 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaders preferred respecting rules \u201ceven if it\u2019s harder to get things done\u201d rather than bending them. By February 2018, about a year into the Trump administration, that number had grown to 79 percent. While it could fall again if the party regains control of government, the figures suggest that a large number of Democrats hold attitudes potentially at odds with pushes for structural reforms that would advantage them.\n\n\n\nActivists emphasize, however, that proposals like eliminating the filibuster, ending gerrymandering, and reforming the judiciary would not just build more Democratic power, it would also enfranchise more voters and make our counter-majoritarian institutions better reflect the will of the majority.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur goal with these reforms is to make our democracy more representative purely to put power in the hands of the people, and the way that we present these reforms really has to be in terms of good government,\u201d Levin said. \u201cThis is how democracy ought to run and it has been taken over by a group that don\u2019t want democracy to respond to the people. They fundamentally view a representative democracy as a threat to their extremist policy goals. We\u2019re looking to reverse that. Now, many of the reforms that we\u2019re proposing would be supported among Democratic Party officials. And some of them might not be. And that\u2019s fine and good. Our goal is not to strengthen the Democratic Party. It\u2019s protecting democracy as a whole.\u201d\n\nRichie said that the energy and attention Democrats have brought to government reform efforts have been good for both progressive and nonpartisan reformers alike.\n\n\u201cFrankly, from a reformer\u2019s perspective, you kind of need both, expect both,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually pretty important, I think, to have it be the right thing to do. And I think we can make the case\u2014for proportional representation, say\u2014that is very much the right thing to do for the country, the right thing to do for a number of different aspects that are broken in our politics, dealing with, with race and representation, and obviously the geographic problem, and one party demonizing a whole region of the country because they don\u2019t represent people there, and so on. Fixing that is important.\u201d\n\n\n\nNevertheless, it remains inescapably true that the Republican Party has a vested interest in safeguarding America\u2019s counter-majoritarian institutions and practices, whereas the Democratic Party stands to benefit from undoing them. In any event, they can only be undone if progressive activists and politicians manage to convince the American majority that empowering the Democratic Party will mean empowering themselves.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing increasing consensus on issues like gun safety, like reproductive rights,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cAnd yet you have these elements that are helping Republicans win the day even though they don\u2019t have the majority of the people on their side. And I think that the public appetite for stomaching that is only going to last for so much longer.\u201d", "description": "As Democrats ponder a number of necessary governmental reforms, an army of progressive organizations is building support among the electorate.", "authors": ["Osita Nwanevu"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/e0c2ee5277b918bd457d83bfef28de4d33427955.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
