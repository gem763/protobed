After what he got caught doing, any pol who does not so vote cannot be honest....are you listening Dems?,' Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nDemocrats, who control a majority in the House, are expected to easily vote down the Republican resolution.\n\nDonald Trump berated Democrats for their support of Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who has become a presidential punching bag\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is leading the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and Democrats are expected to vote down the GOP censure resolution against him\n\nSchiff has become Trump's favorite punching bag with the president calling him names - such as 'Liddle' Adam Schiff' - and railing against him on Twitter. Trump was furious after Schiff read a parody of his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and called on the Democratic lawmaker from California to resign from Congress.\n\nAdditionally, the president did not invite Schiff to take part in last week's White House meeting to update a bipartisan group of lawmakers on the situation with Turkey, a notable snub to the Intelligence Committee chairman. That meeting ended with Democratic leadership walking about and Speaker Nancy Pelosi accusing Trump of a meltdown.\n\nRepublicans have taken up the president's call to accuse the chairman of lying to his fellow lawmakers and hiding information from them.\n\nSchiff controls who hears the testimony from witnesses in the impeachment inquiry. Thus far he has limited it to staff and lawmakers from the three committees with jurisdiction - Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Relations - which Republicans have blasted him for.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House, and the rest of the GOP leadership is backing the censure resolution.\n\nMcCarthy cited Schiff's parody statement as one of the reasons for the censure along with Schiff's control of the impeachment process. Schiff has said all the witness interview transcripts will eventually be made public.\n\n'Right now, one person is having all of the power,' McCarthy told Maria Bartiromo on 'Sunday Morning Futures' this weekend.\n\n'They are denying members of Congress from even being in the room or hearing the transcripts and reading them of what's being said. Adam Schiff controls who can come into the room,' he added.\n\n'I think it's only proper that the House itself censure this individual,' McCarthy argued.\n\nHouse Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy is supporting the censure resolution into Schiff\n\nAdam Schiff enjoys strong support from Speaker Nancy Pelosi\n\nAs many as 135 GOP lawmakers have signed on to the resolution as co-sponsors, Fox News reported, but it's not enough to bring it up for a vote.\n\nA majority of lawmakers would have to agree - which is 216 members. Democrats control 234 seats and are unlikely to support the move against Schiff, who enjoys strong support from Speaker Pelosi.\n\nThe resolution to censure Schiff was first introduced late last month by Republican Congressman Andy Biggs, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe move could unit Republicans, some of whom have grown increasingly critical of the president after his with draw of U.S. troops from Syria and his original decision to host next year's G20 conference at his Doral Trump resort - a decision he reversed over the weekend when it become clear he did not have the party's support for it.\n\nSome Republicans have even announced their support of the impeachment process at a time the president needs his party unified around him.\n\nGOP Lawmaker Francis Rooney of Florida, who announced his retirement over the weekend, has said he's open to the inquiry.\n\n\"I want to get the facts and do the right thing,\" he said Friday on Capitol Hill. \"Because I'll be looking at my children a lot longer than I'm looking at anybody in this building.\"", "description": "Donald Trump berated Democrats for their support of Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, the man the president has made the target of his fury in the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/14/19992850-0-image-a-14_1571666088260.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
