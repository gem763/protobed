(AP)\n\nOil prices jumped on global markets Sunday night after a wave of weekend drone attacks instantly erased half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production.\n\nBrent crude on Sunday traded at $70.98 per barrel on oil futures markets, an 18 percent surge from Friday\u2019s close of $60.15, before falling back to about a 12 percent increase. U.S. benchmark West Texas intermediate crude opened at $61.27 per barrel, a 12 percent climb, before easing to a 10 percent gain.\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump said via Twitter that he had authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a to-be-determined amount. He added that he told government agencies \u201cto expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other States.\u201d\n\nThe attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure immediately knocked out 5.7 million barrels \u2014 or nearly 6 percent of the 100 million barrels a day the world consumes.\n\n\u201cA supply disruption on this scale is an extraordinary event,\u201d said Pavel Molchanov, an oil analyst with Raymond James. \u201cNo single disruption on this scale has occurred in decades.\u201d\n\nU.S. oil prices have been trading in a belt between $50 and $60 a barrel in the past six months. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has been trading slightly above that range. Most oil companies and nations favor world oil prices in the $70 to $80 range, which allows a healthy profit without rattling the economy or sparking a rush for alternatives to petroleum.\n\nOil prices could spike in the next several days as a result of the attack on Saudi\u2019s state-run oil company, Saudi Aramco, which is the second-largest oil producer in the world at 9.85 million barrels per day in August.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis are scrambling to make repairs and keep the oil flowing,\u201d said John Kilduff of Again Capital. \u201cThe response will determine how high prices go and for how long.\u201d\n\nA jump in oil prices is likely to weigh on an already-declining global economy, one beset by the U.S.-China trade war, White House sanctions against Iran and a decade-long economic expansion that shows signs of petering out.\n\nOn Sunday, Saudi officials said only a third of the affected 5.7 million barrels would be restored by Monday, leaving millions of barrels day offline indefinitely.\n\nWith oil giants Venezuela and Iran mostly absent from world markets, an extended Saudi supply disruption could force industrial economies such as the U.S. to tap emergency reserves. There are 1.5 billion barrels available in strategic reserves among industrial economies.\n\nThe U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve currently holds 645 million barrels, equal to about one month of U.S. oil consumption.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that there is more than enough oil in inventory to prevent fuel shortages,\u201d Molchanov said. \u201cThere are not going to be gasoline lines like there were in the 1970s.\u201d\n\nThough Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the weekend blasts, the U.S. blames Iran for the \u201cunprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply.\u201d Tehran has denied responsibility.\n\nThe last time the world lost a comparable slice of its oil supply was during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. As a result, there was a substantial increase in global oil prices, but the process was a gradual because the war had been expected.\n\nOil prices result from a careful balance of supply and demand. Supplies have been mostly in balance this year, as U.S. production has made up for declines in Venezuela and Iran.\n\nEven though the U.S. produces more oil than ever before \u2014 close to 12 million barrels a day \u2014 a disruption halfway around the world can send prices soaring on global markets.\n\nBut Americans are more insulated from dramatic swings because technological advances have increased domestic oil output and heightened efficiency, from automobile mileage to home heating. U.S. shale oil production has reduced domestic demand for Persian Gulf oil from 3 million barrels a day in 2003 to 1 million barrels now. The U.S. economy is far less dependent on manufacturing than it was during the big oil price spikes of the 1970s and \u201980s.\n\nOil companies also are a smaller piece of the stock market. The energy sector comprised more than 20 percent of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500\u2019s total value in the 1970s. Now it\u2019s only 4.44 percent.\n\nOil prices have been relatively calm in recent weeks because of high production and slowing demand. But trade disputes, sanctions against Iran, and Venezuela\u2019s internal meltdown have contributed to confusion in oil markets.\n\nU.S. oil production has helped keep a lid on gasoline prices. Americans this month saw the lowest Labor Day gas prices in three years.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been the industry\u2019s great stabilizer, with $10 trillion worth of oil under its sands. But the kingdom and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have been unable to limit production enough to keep prices within the sweet spot of $70 to $80 a barrel.\n\n\u201cThis attack provides a stark reminder that geopolitical risk to oil supply is very real,\u201d Molchanov said.", "description": "The weekend attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure knocked out nearly 6 percent of the 100 million barrels a day the world consumes.", "authors": ["Thomas Heath", "Local Business Reporter", "Columnist", "Writing About Entrepreneurs", "Companies In The Washington Metropolitan Area", "September At Pm", "Thomas Heath Is A Local Business Reporter", "Various Companies Big", "Small In The Washington Metropolitan Area.
