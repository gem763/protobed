While the labor department announced the unemployment rate remained at 3.7%, a near 50-year low, the pace of hiring slowed markedly, down from an average of 192,000 new jobs a month last year to 143,000 so far this year.\n\nRelated: US and China agree to reopen trade talks in October\n\nThe figures were particularly worrying for the president. Mining, an industry where Trump has promised to bring back jobs, lost 5,000 positions over the month. Manufacturing added just 3,000 jobs and June and July\u2019s figures were revised down. Factory production has declined for two consecutive quarters, according to the Federal Reserve, and is already technically in recession.\n\nTrump dismissed suggestions the report was anything less than stellar.\n\nThe Economy is great. The only thing adding to \u201cuncertainty\u201d is the Fake News! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2019\n\nAugust\u2019s figures were also boosted by the US government hiring 25,000 temporary workers to conduct its 2020 national census. And the report cut its assessments for job gains for June and July by a total of 20,000.\n\nAfter the news broke Trump resumed his attack on the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell. \u201cWhere did I find this guy Jerome? Oh well, you can\u2019t win them all!\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nI agree with @jimcramer, the Fed should lower rates. They were WAY too early to raise, and Way too late to cut - and big dose quantitative tightening didn\u2019t exactly help either. Where did I find this guy Jerome? Oh well, you can\u2019t win them all! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2019\n\nTrump has consistently blamed the Fed for slowing economic growth by refusing to quickly cut interest rates despite the fact that they remain historically low and have throughout the economic recovery.\n\nThe US jobs report comes as fears of a global recession are escalating. The European Central Bank has signaled it is planning to cut interest rates and announce a new stimulus package. The moves come as the latest industrial production figures from Germany give \u201ca convincing signal that Germany is in recession\u201d, Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe 130,000 gain in non-farm payroll employment in August was flattered by the hiring of 25,000 temporary workers to help prepare for next year\u2019s census. More generally, there has been a clear slowdown in trend employment growth, particularly in the private sector, with the six-month average monthly gain below 150,000,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.\n\nHe said revisions that will be incorporated into the data early next year will probably knock another 500,000 jobs off the overall gains in employment over the year, meaning the current average monthly jobs gain will be closer to 110,000. But Ashworth said besides the headline numbers the report was \u201cquite positive\u201d and pointed to stronger wage growth.\n\nThe US has now added jobs for a record 95 months in a row. Wage growth, which has lagged behind the recovery in the jobs market, has also started to pick up and rose at an annual rate of 3.2% in August.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Hiring slowed amid trade war as economists expected to add about 160,000 jobs while unemployment rate remained at 3.7%While the labor department announced the unemployment rate remained at 3.7%, the pace of hiring slowed markedly, down from an average of 192,000 new jobs a month last year to 143,000", "authors": ["Dominic Rushe In New York"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rwlVEDAQCAbe9LD9ap5Saw--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/a426cc3dc5968579edf7c5b333132542", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
