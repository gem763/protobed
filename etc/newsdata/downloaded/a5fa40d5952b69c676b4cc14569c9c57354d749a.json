In the past three months, it added 6.7million new subscribers, bringing its total userbase to 153million worldwide.\n\nBut the next three months will prove to be its most challenging yet. Soon, Netflix will be competing with Disney+, HBO Max and Apple+ - all companies with enormous brand recognition and a strong desire to take their own slice of streaming\u2019s riches.\n\nOn Wednesday, Netflix wrote to investors to tell them that competition would be a good thing. The rising tide of streaming services would just tempt more people away from \u201clinear TV\u201d, as they term it, and into streaming services.\n\n\u201cJust like the evolution from broadcast TV to cable, these once-in-a-generation changes are very large and open up big, new opportunities for many players,\u201d the company told investors.\n\n\u201cFor example, for the first few decades of cable, networks like TBS, USA, ESPN, MTV and Discovery didn\u2019t take much audience share from each other, but instead, they collectively took audience share from broadcast viewing.\u201d\n\nNetflix pointed to the fact that its growth rate in the US and Canada had been almost identical in the past six years, despite only one of those markets - the US - having a significant competitor in Hulu.\n\nThat may be the case, but Netflix\u2019s argument neglects to address what will be different about what it can offer subscribers in the years ahead. Netflix\u2019s back catalogue is in the process of being slowly picked to pieces, with competitors taking back shows and movies that they agreed to put on Netflix at a time when they didn\u2019t have a streaming product of their own.\n\nLost shows\n\nIn one high-profile example, the era-defining sitcom Friends, which has been a huge hit on Netflix since being added in 2015, will be moving entirely to HBO\u2019s platform in 2020.\n\nIn what was seen as an effort to counteract that loss, Netflix reportedly paid an astronomical half a billion dollars to secure the rights to Seinfeld Up against Friends, Seinfeld has arguably far less global appeal, and looks rather tired when compared to Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David\u2019s Seinfeld spin-off-of-sorts, which will be an HBO Max exclusive.\n\nFriends and \u201cCurb\u201d are just two examples. Netflix is losing shows hand over fist. British classics, such as The Office, are now on Britbox. The US Office, cited by many Netflix users as great \u201cbackground noise\u201d, is being taken away, too - for NBC\u2019s new streaming service, Peacock. That\u2019ll launch in April.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Netflix was outbid by Apple for The Morning Show, starring Jennifer Aniston (left) and Reese Witherspoon\n\nIt means Netflix will need to rely even more heavily on its original content. The \u201cNetflix Original\u201d brand is already well-established and highly-respected. Netflix originals took away 27 wins at this year\u2019s Emmys (HBO won 34, Amazon 15).\n\n\u201cWhile the new competitors have some great titles (especially catalogue titles),\u201d Netflix told investors, \u201cnone have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming that we are producing around the world.\u201d\n\nThat assertion on quality is to be debated in the pages of the Hollywood press, not here. But what\u2019s inescapable for Netflix is that, despite the critical acclaim, those originals aren\u2019t having the bottom line impact investors expect.\n\nEven with the return of one of its stand-out originals, Stranger Things, this most recent quarter (three months ending in September) saw Netflix add just 530,000 new subscribers in the US, below Wall Street's expectations. In the previous quarter, it lost 126,000 subscribers in the country.\n\nIts subscriber growth, then, has mostly come from investing in international markets - with 6.26 million paid members added in the last quarter.\n\nOutbid\n\nWithout a strong back catalogue, Netflix knows it must keep investing in original content to survive, an extremely costly endeavour: analysts have said the company is going to spend around $15bn on new content this year.\n\nTo maintain that kind of investment, it told investors today it was looking to borrow more money, against a backdrop of investors becoming increasingly worried that the return of investment may not be coming, and that with deep-pocketed newcomers muscling in, the price of acquiring new programmes could rise further.\n\nNetflix chief executive Reed Hastings admitted his company was outbid for Fleabag, which ended up being a co-production between Amazon and the BBC, and arguably the most talked about new show of the past year. Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the show\u2019s co-writer and star, has now signed to Amazon exclusively.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple flexed its riches in beating Netflix to securing \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d, Jennifer Aniston\u2019s return to TV, where she'll appear alongside Reese Witherspoon. Apple\u2019s clout brings another advantage: every new purchase of an Apple device will come with a year\u2019s subscription of Apple+. Netflix has its work cut out in convincing Apple users to add its service on top. So does everyone else, for that matter.\n\nNetflix looks precarious. Old shows are disappearing, and the company faces an unprecedented fight for the new ones.\n\nReed Hasting\u2019s visionary approach to delivering movies over the internet gave Netflix a 12-year head start, but that counts for little when customers can stop paying whenever they please.\n\nAs Mr Hastings told an audience in the UK last month, his company is now part of \u201ca whole new world\u201d (though, if you want to see the movie featuring that song\u2026 it\u2019s a Disney+ exclusive).\n\n_____\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?
