'It did not represent the U.S. Naval Academy's Command Religious Program.'\n\n'This email was sent without the review and approval of the Naval Academy's Command Chaplain, as required by command policy,' USNA spokeswoman Commander Alana Garas said. The group planned to meet in the Commodore Uriah P. Levy Center\n\nShe added that the group had requested the space for a 'study group.'\n\n'The USNA Command Religious Program provides for the exercise of diverse beliefs,' Garas added. 'Arrangements were being made to provide the Midshipmen with a designated place to assemble as chaplains facilitate for the beliefs of all service members.'\n\nGaras added that the Satanic Temple represents 'a non-theistic religious and politically active movement' which U.S. military are forbidden from engaging in.\n\nGaras added that the Satanic Temple represents 'a non-theistic religious and politically active movement' which U.S. military are forbidden from engaging in.\n\n'The Command Religious Program at the Naval Academy facilitates the opportunity for the free expression of diverse beliefs, but without endorsing any particular belief, [and] Midshipmen have the right to assemble to discuss their beliefs as they choose,' Garas continued.\n\n'But, to be clear, in accordance with Department of Defense Policy, military members will not engage in partisan political activities, and will avoid the inference that their activities may appear to imply DoD approval or endorsement of a political cause.'\n\nIn April, the Satanic Temple was given section 501(c) tax exempt status, which puts it in the same bracket as major religions such as Catholicism and organizations such as the Salvation Army.\n\nThe recognition means that the Satanic Temple, which has 16 chapters in the U.S. and thousands of followers around the world, can apply for certain federal grants.\n\nAnyone who donates money to the group can also write it off as a tax deduction.", "description": "An email sent to U.S. Naval Academy midshipmen on October 8 offered to hold 'satanic religious services.
