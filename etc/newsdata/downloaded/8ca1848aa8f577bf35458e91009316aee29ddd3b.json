She then moved on to impeachment, and offered the podium to House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) \u2014 but then grew annoyed when reporters wanted to ask her about that topic.\n\n\u201cDo we have any questions, first, on the work to meet the needs of the American people in terms of USMCA and the H.R. 3? On that subject?\u201d she began.\n\nThe first question asked her how she expected to do anything while impeaching the president: \u201cHow do you envision working with this president on these key Democratic agenda items \u2014 lowering prescription drug costs, you know, ensuring tougher gun safety measures as you are actively considering whether to remove him from office?\u201d\n\nThe two had \u201cnothing to do with each other,\u201d Pelosi responded, claiming that she could work with President Trump while trying to impeach him because he had an interest in passing key legislative proposals for his own reasons.\n\nAfter another question about the USMCA, the remaining questions were about impeachment, which she resisted:\n\n\u201dAnyone on H.R. 3? Does anybody in this room care about the cost of prescription drugs and what it means to America\u2019s working families? From time to time you have asked those questions \u2014 does anyone care about the USMCA?\u201d\n\nPresident Trump later tweeted:\n\nNancy Pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices & working on the desperately needed USMCA. She is incapable of working on either. It is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment. The Do Nothing Democrats are stuck in mud! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nHe also later tweeted that Democrats were \u201cwasting everyone\u2019s time and energy on BULLSHIT.\u201d\n\nJoel B.
