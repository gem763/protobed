CFM has declined to comment.\n\nAccording to the AFP report, which cited multiple unnamed security sources, cyber attacks in the past months on Airbus were mounted via French technology consultancy Expleo, engine maker Rolls Royce (L: ), and two French Airbus subcontractors which were not identified.\n\nExpleo and Rolls Royce did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nOver the past 12 months, Airbus has been targeted by four major cyber attacks, AFP cited one of the sources as saying. Some of the attacks date back further, the report said.\n\nThe hackers appeared to have been seeking information about engines for the A400M military transport aircraft and A350 airliner, according to the sources in the report.\n\nThe AFP report did not make clear whether the cyber attacks it described had actually led to data breaches or impacted Airbus operations.\n\nIt said the security sources had not definitively attributed responsibility for the cyber attacks, but that they bore the hallmarks of groups linked to Chinese intelligence.", "description": "Hackers tried to steal Airbus secrets via contractors: AFP", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8P0HZ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
