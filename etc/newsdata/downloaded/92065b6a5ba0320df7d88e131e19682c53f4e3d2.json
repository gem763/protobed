Built into the MyAussie app, a connection 'kick' acts like a remotely-controlled fresh reboot but even more powerful. Rather than just the old switch on, switch off method for your modem when it's playing up, the 'kick' will restart everything all the way through the network.\n\nIt might not be able to solve any major issues, but most minor issues could likely be resolved through this ultimate switch.\n\nThe kick solution was built by the ISP's in-house development team in 45 days and will be available to the 39,000 customers who use the MyAussie app, according to Aussie Broadband.\n\nHow do I 'kick' my internet?\n\nTo 'kick' your connection on Aussie Broadband, you'll first need the MyAussie app. Select your Service Tests and then choose Kick Connection. Doing this will completely reset your connection and will force your devices to re-authenticate with the network. It's a minor inconvenience for what might likely solve your issues.\n\nIf you're not currently an Aussie Broadband Customer, you can check out some of the best plans below. Click on the interactive tables to see the full inclusions!\n\nNBN 25 / Casual Plan (500GB Data, $55 per month)\n\nNBN 25 / Everyday Plan (Unlimited Data, $69 per month)\n\nNBN 50 / Family Plan (Unlimited Data, $79 per month)\n\nNBN 100 / Power User Plan (Unlimited Data, $99 per month)\n\nThe above plans are also available in Fixed Wireless iterations for the same price and with the same data inclusions", "description": "A dodgy home internet connection is just expected if you're living in Australia.
