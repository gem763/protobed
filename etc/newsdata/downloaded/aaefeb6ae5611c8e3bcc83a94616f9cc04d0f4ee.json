The dog suddenly jumped on her, biting her knee and locking on.\n\n\"The accused shouted at it to let go and took it by the collar. After several seconds the dog eventually let go of the leg.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\"The accused admitted the dog was to have been kept on a muzzle.\"\n\nBennett pleaded with the victim not to report the attack, but walked off without muzzling the animal, the court heard.\n\n\"She had at least eight deep puncture wounds around the knee,\" Ms Graham said. \"The dog had broken the skin and drawn blood.\"\n\nBennett contacted the police and told them about the incident and asked what would happen as a result. She immediately took the dog to the vet to be euthanised.\n\nShe said the muzzle had broken the previous evening and she had taken a chance to walk the dog without it as she thought no-one would be around.\n\nSolicitor Pauline Cullerton, defending, said: \"This was the second such incident. The first was before she took control of the dog. She took it as a rescue dog.\n\n\"She realises it could have been avoided. It should have been muzzled. She indicated she is keen to make compensation towards the victim.\"\n\nSheriff Gillian Wade said: \"Had you not had the dog destroyed I would have had no hesitation in making that order myself.\n\n\"I give you credit for doing that at the earliest opportunity.\"", "description": "Owner Debbie Bennett was ordered to pay injured runner Alison Lee \u00a3600 compensation following the incident in Perth", "authors": ["Gordon Currie", "Image", "Perthshire Advertiser", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20742133.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_PAY-Debbie-Bennett.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
