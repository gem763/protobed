Fetzer called the decision \u201cabsurd\u201d and said he would appeal, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.\n\nThe award of damages comes four months after Dane County Circuit Judge Frank Remington issued a summary judgement that Fetzer and his co-author Mike Palecek had defamed Pozner by falsely claiming that the death certificate for Pozner\u2019s son, Noah, had been faked. Palecek settled out of court in September, while the book\u2019s publisher, Moon Rock Books, settled out of court in June. The terms of those settlements have not been made public.\n\nAlso Read: Father of Sandy Hook Victim Wins Defamation Suit Against 'Nobody Died at Sandy Hook' Authors\n\nPozner went to extraordinary lengths to prove the book wrong: His lawsuit included a redacted copy of the death certificate, and Pozner also provided public access to Noah\u2019s birth certificate, report cards, and medical records, Pozner told TheWrap after the lawsuit verdict was announced in June. He even took a DNA test to prove that Noah was his son.\n\n\u201cJim Fetzer\u2019s grotesque allegations were amplified to millions by Alex Jones and InfoWars. For over five years, InfoWars spread these lies for profit despite knowing Mr. Fetzer was mentally unwell,\u201d Pozner\u2019s attorneys Mark Bankston and Kaster Lynch said in a statement provided to TheWrap.\n\n\u201cThe verdict against Mr. Fetzer shows that even minor figures in the Sandy Hook hoax harassment campaign can be held accountable for maliciously spreading lies,\u201d they continued.\n\nFetzer did not immediately respond to a request for comment from TheWrap.\n\nAlso Read: Alex Jones Accused of Threatening Lawyer for Sandy Hook Families After Child Porn Found in Discovery Materials\n\nPozner has also sued InfoWars radio host Alex Jones, who frequently promoted the conspiracy theory that the Sandy Hook massacre was faked on his show. About that suit, Pozner\u2019s attorneys said: \u201cThe Wisconsin jury has spoken on the level of damage a bit player like Mr. Fetzer has done. Soon, a Texas jury will speak on the level of damage done to Mr. Pozner by Alex Jones, who copied Mr. Fetzer\u2019s obscure rants and used them to make money on a massive scale.\u201d\n\nSince his initial fueling of the conspiracy theory, Jones has said he believes the shooting did occur, according to the Associated Press.\n\nPamela Chelin contributed to this post.\n\nRead original story Father of Sandy Hook Victim Awarded $450,000 in Defamation Lawsuit Against \u2018Nobody Died at Sandy Hook\u2019 Co-Author At TheWrap", "description": "A Wisconsin jury on Tuesday awarded Lenny Pozner, the father of a 6-year-old Sandy Hook shooting victim, $450,000 in his defamation lawsuit against the co-author of the book, \u201cNobody Died at Sandy Hook.\u201dThe Jury determined that James Fetzer must pay the amount after Pozner\u2019s attorneys argued that the", "authors": ["Ross A.
