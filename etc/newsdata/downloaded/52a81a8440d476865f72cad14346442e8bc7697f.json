During his two consecutive terms as president, he was viewed as a reformer and anti-corruption fighter and still has a positive image inside Georgia.\n\nWhile we don't have exact technical details on how hackers breached Pro-Service and defaced all sites, some sites were hit harder than others.\n\nFor example, at least two television stations (TV Imedi and TV Maestro) went off-the-air following the attacks, according to a Facebook post from Irakli Chikhladze, TV Imedi head of news.\n\nTV channel Pirveli was also affected but did not go off-the-air. Some newspaper sites are still offline at the time of writing, according to some cursory checks by ZDNet.\n\nA Pro-Service spokesperson could not be reached by phone for additional details about the attack, although the company has been updating its website periodically with new information.\n\nThe culprit behind the attacks has not yet been identified; however, authorities said they started an investigation.\n\nSimilarities to 2008 Russian cyber-attacks\n\nBut today's attack is not unique. During the five-day Russo-Georgian War of 2008, Georgia saw a series of similar attacks.\n\nFor example, Russian hackers used BGP hijacking to reroute Georgian internet traffic through servers in Russia, defaced government websites, and hacked TV and radio stations.\n\nMany Georgians were quick to link or liken today's mass-defacement to the 2008 hacks, although there is no evidence to support such theories -- for the time being.", "description": "A hacker has defaced over 15,000 websites hosted on the infrastructure of Pro-Service, a Georgian web hosting provider, including government sites, local newspapers, and TV stations.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/28/9aa94c10-2847-4352-845a-1f3a07541f1f/thumbnail/770x578/2c0eef7351c9835cc2d5f0c6b4d096e5/georgia-hack.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
