The media was holding Choudary up as the voice of the Muslim community, even after the death of Lee Rigby he was on the TV.\u201d\n\nMr Humble said ALM\u2019s high-profile provocations and protests \u201creinforced everything\u201d he thought about Muslims, as he rose up the EDL\u2019s ranks to become the regional organiser for East Anglia.\n\nHe fears they drove a permanent change in the British public\u2019s perception of Islam, as years-old ALM stunts and campaigns are recycled on the internet as supposed proof of the \u201cIslamisation\u201d of Britain.\n\n\u201cThey overlooked Choudary for too long and it will do damage for years to come,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Morton said the link between ALM and the EDL was evidence of the \u201csymbiotic relationship between jihadism and right-wing extremism\u201d, adding: \u201cALM\u2019s impact went far beyond the terrorist threat it posed.\u201d\n\nHe was in contact with Choudary and other ALM leaders when they were planning protests including the infamous 2010 Armistice Day poppy burning, and recalls discussions of how media coverage could be used to \u201cfragment society\u201d on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nHe said Islamist groups linked to Choudary were \u201cwell aware\u201d that their activities were driving support to the far right, and actively used the EDL and other groups in their own propaganda.\n\n\u201cOne of the primary strategies was to get on TV, which was very easy \u2013 particularly if you were able to do provocative things to reap the ire of the far right,\u201d Mr Morton said.\n\n\u201cIt became increasingly easy to antagonise them and anti-Muslim sentiment started to grow over here [in the US] as well.\u201d\n\nMr Morton said Choudary was a \u201cmaster at creating widespread polarisation\u201d and deliberately let his own extreme views be presented as that of all Muslims in the UK.\n\nHe said Islamists and the far right \u201cstill play off against each other\u201d, and that a \u201ccivil war-like atmosphere\u201d in politics on both sides of the Atlantic was fuelling both sides.\n\nThe Columbia University graduate converted to Islam in 2000 and came into contact with ALM\u2019s American offshoot in 2004.\n\nThe Islamic Thinkers Society, which was calling for a global Islamic state, put Mr Morton in touch with high-profile Islamists including Choudary, Jamaican preacher Abdullah el-Faisal and al-Qaeda propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a 2011 drone strike.\n\nIn 2007, he and fellow extremists started their own group \u2013 Revolution Muslim \u2013 and continued street preaching while running a website featuring al-Qaeda propaganda.\n\nTwo years later, Mr Morton launched the Jihad Recollections magazine, which is seen as a precursor to al-Qaeda\u2019s Inspire and Isis\u2019s glossy Dabiq and Rumiyah publications.\n\nBut in 2011, he was arrested and jailed after a follower made threats against the creators of South Park for mocking the prophet Mohammad.\n\nMr Morton, who then went by the name Younes Abdullah Mohammed, became an FBI informant in prison and was freed early in 2015.\n\nNow, working with Mr Humble and other former radicals, he is using the propaganda format he pioneered to challenge jihadis and the far right by releasing counterextremist magazines through his Parallel Networks organisation.\n\nMr Morton plans to spread the publications, which are formatted to appear identical to radical literature, in online chat groups used by extremists.\n\nThey hope to penetrate online echo-chambers of the kind where Mr Humble said he was \u201cbrainwashed\u201d by challenging dominant narratives.\n\nThe pair said the dialogue and friendship they have forged gives them hope for current extremists.\n\nMr Humble said he never could have imagined working with a former jihadi while in the EDL, but that they had \u201cclicked\u201d over their shared radicalisation by Choudary.\n\nMr Morton hopes their personal dialogue could be scaled up into a wider discourse between Islamist and the far right, adding: \u201cThey\u2019re much more similar than they are different.\u201d\n\n*Al-Muhajiroun (ALM) has been used in this article to describe all incarnations of Choudary\u2019s Islamist network, which operated under names including al-Ghurabaa, Islam4UK, Islamic Path and Muslims Against Crusades", "description": "In June 2009, Anjem Choudary acolyte Jesse Morton was working with al-Qaeda supporters to spread the call to jihad across America.
