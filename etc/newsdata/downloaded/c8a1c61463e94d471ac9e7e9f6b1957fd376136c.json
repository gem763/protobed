Mark Levine applauded Mr. Herring\u2019s move to rollback the \u201cobnoxious\u201d statute and announced Sunday he would submit legislation during the 2020 session to remove the question completely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m committed to removing unfair and unconstitutional statutes from our books,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cJust like Virginia\u2019s miscegenation (anti-mixed-race marriage) law declared unconstitutional in Loving v. Virginia (1967), this statute does not belong on our books, lest someone believe it is still the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cStatutes like this remind us of Virginia\u2019s ugly past but no longer reflect Virginia values,\u201d he added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
