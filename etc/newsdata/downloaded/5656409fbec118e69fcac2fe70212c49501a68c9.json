He was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit public nuisance and taken to a police station, where he currently remains in police custody.\u201d\n\nHeathrow and police refused to comment on specific measures they may have taken to stop the protesters\u2019 drones from working, but one expert said existing technology can jam signals between operators and drones.\n\nRichard Gill, chief executive of Drone Defence, told the Press Association: \u201cThat technology is definitely available and can do exactly that. When a drone is operated remotely it relies on a radio connection between the drone and the pilot. Interference can cut that connection between the operator and the drone.\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve waited 25 years for a movement like Extinction Rebellion\u2019 Read more\n\nFormer Paralympian James Brown was arrested at Terminal 2 on Friday after he took part in the protest, and he told PA that there were up to 35 people willing to fly the devices in an attempt to cause disruption.\n\nMr Brown, who is partially sighted, did not actually fly a drone and said he held it above his head.\n\nDespite the minimal disruption, Heathrow Pause said it is happy about the \u201cconversation\u201d triggered by its action.\n\nIt said on Friday: \u201cThe real objective was always to trigger a sensible, honest conversation, throughout society, on the dangerous folly of Heathrow expansion, with the ultimate objective of cancelling the third runway.\n\n\u201cThat conversation is now happening. It is incumbent on all of us to keep it going.\u201d\n\nHeathrow Airport confirmed its runways were open and said they were committed to addressing climate change.\n\nIt said in a statement on Friday: \u201cWe will continue to work with the authorities to carry out dynamic risk assessment programmes and keep our passengers flying safely on their journeys today.\n\n\u201cWe agree with the need for climate change action but illegal protest activity, designed with the intention of disrupting thousands of people, is not the answer.\n\n\u201cThe answer to climate change is in constructive engagement and working together to address the issue, something that Heathrow remains strongly committed to do.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor advised Heathrow passengers to travel as normal and said they were \u201cconfident\u201d disruption would be kept to a minimum.\n\nThis action is the latest in a string of climate change protests this year, including the widespread action in London in April, which saw Extinction Rebellion bring sites including Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge to a standstill.", "description": "Group said that Roger Hallam had been apprehended for the second time in three days", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ec55b6bf1c261f1f85b5b0473578d4cb0417fd7/0_0_4171_2503/master/4171.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe5fba579edc380e1589fee3a57222a3", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
