I predict that it will be released,\u201d Rouhani said at a news conference in New York during the United Nations\u2019 annual gathering of world leaders.\n\nThe ship\u2019s owner, Stena Bulk of Sweden, said on Wednesday the vessel was still being held in Iran despite the lifting of a detention order on the tanker by Tehran.\n\nStena Bulk said it was not in negotiations with Iran and was not aware of any formal charges against the crew or the company.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign ministry said earlier on Wednesday that a lifting of the detention order had been finalised but that an investigation into the vessel was ongoing.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been accused of anything,\u201d Stena Bulk Chief Executive Erik Hanell said in a telephone interview. \u201cNot through any formal letter or anything else to the company.\n\n\u201cWe are still in the dark over why we are anchored in Bandar Abbas,\u201d said Hanell, referring to the port city on Iran\u2019s southern coast, on the Gulf.\n\nThe CEO said the ship was fueled and ready to steam for a port in the United Arab Emirates as soon as it was cleared to leave.\n\nIranian forces seized the Stena Impero on July 19 for alleged marine violations two weeks after British marines detained an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar. The Iranian vessel was released in August.\n\nThe actions followed attacks on other merchant vessels in Gulf oil shipping routes which Washington blamed on Tehran. Iran has denied responsibility.\n\nThe head of Iran\u2019s Ports and Maritime Organization, Mohammad Rastad, said on Monday that the Stena Impero was free to depart Bandar Abbas port after legal hurdles had been cleared.\n\nHanell said there were still Iranian guards on the ship and said he had no idea why the ship had not been allowed to leave yet.\n\n\u201cWe had a dialogue with them up until the end of last week. We thought everything was ready\u201d for the ship to be released, Hanell said.\n\nIran freed seven of the ship\u2019s 23 crew members earlier this month. Stena Bulk has tried to get the rest out as well, in part by offering a crew exchange.", "description": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Thursday he expected the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero, seized by Iran in July, to be released after the completion of legal procedures in his country.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434277134&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1YK-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
