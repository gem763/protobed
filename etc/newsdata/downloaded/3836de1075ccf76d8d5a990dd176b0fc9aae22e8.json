Because these entities are run or backstopped by the U.S. government, a large increase in loan defaults could cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nThis risk is the direct result of pressure from the lending industry, consumer groups and political appointees, who clamored for the government to intervene when homeownership rates fell several years ago. Starting in the Obama administration, numerous government officials obliged, mistakenly expecting that the private market ultimately would take over.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Business Economy Federal-Government-Has-Dramatically-Expanded-Exposure-To-Risky-Mortgages"], "top_image": ""}
