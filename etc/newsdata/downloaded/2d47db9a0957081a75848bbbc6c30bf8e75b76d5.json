They\u2019ve also underscored the polarization of its remaining three commissioners \u2014 one short of the four needed to conduct business.\n\nAD\n\nThe fracas is unfolding at a crucial time for the agency that enforces campaign finance laws, as threats of foreign interference loom over the run-up to the 2020 election.\n\nSome criticize Weintraub, a Democrat, for being an unusually outspoken FEC commissioner; others say they can\u2019t blame her, citing the surreal political moment. In interviews, Weintraub has chosen her words carefully. She has avoided direct comment on specific allegations of electoral wrongdoing, including those concerning Trump, his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and Giuliani\u2019s associates.\n\nAD\n\nBut online, she has sparred with her Republican co-commissioner and has become a vocal critic of the Trump administration from inside the independent federal agency she leads. In one post, she quoted the president\u2019s call for voter identification laws and added \u201cNot this again.\u201d In another, she affixed a mocking \u201cSAD\u201d to an official letter asking Trump to prove his repeated allegations of voter fraud.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want me saying these things because they don\u2019t want people to hear what I have to say,\u201d Weintraub said of her critics, who have also accused her of bias that would compromise her ability to rule on matters involving the president.\n\n\u201cWhat have I done that they object to?\u201d she said. \u201cI have asked for facts \u2014 facts aren\u2019t partisan, just saying. I have explained the law \u2014 I have said over and over again that it is illegal for anyone to solicit, accept or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election. That is black letter law, that is not my political opinion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA key part of her job, Weintraub said, is to communicate with the public. But some of the harshest criticism toward her has come from her colleague, Republican commissioner Caroline C. Hunter.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe has a First Amendment right to speak, but once she uses FEC letterhead and her title as chair to troll the president of the United States and to grandstand, it\u2019s really outrageous,\u201d said Hunter, who recently tangled with Weintraub over the release of a foreign activity memo.\n\nWeintraub has endeared herself to the activist left \u2014 she said she\u2019s been inundated with letters and emails thanking her for fighting; one fan suggested putting her face on a T-shirt. But she said she wouldn\u2019t have spoken out if her agency were running smoothly. With the FEC in disarray, she said, her voice is her power.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf it takes Twitter or going on television or op-eds or making speeches \u2014 any mechanism that I have available to me to get the word out about what the law is \u2014 I am willing to get creative,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nSince the commission\u2019s vice chairman, Matthew S. Peterson, resigned in August, the six-person panel has had just three members: Weintraub, Hunter and Steven T. Walther, an independent. Without a quorum, it can\u2019t enforce regulations, issue advisory opinions or approve audit reports. By law, no more than three commissioners can belong to the same political party.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time in the agency\u2019s history the commission has lost its quorum, and the first time since 2008, the year some believe rang in a new era of intractability at the FEC. Issue One has called it \u201cunacceptable\u201d and set up a website titled \u201cFEC M.I.A.\u201d to count the number of days it remains shorthanded.\n\nAD\n\nBut even when the commission did have enough members to meet, its gatherings often devolved into a quarrel that reflected a deep divide over interpretations of the law and visions for the agency: One side sending dire warnings about the risks of \u201cdark money\u201d and pushing for more reform, and the other side advocating for fewer restrictions on campaign finance.\n\nAD\n\nA graduate of Harvard Law, Weintraub worked in private practice and as a counsel to the House Ethics Committee before joining the FEC in 2002, when she was appointed by President George W. Bush. She\u2019s the longest sitting of the remaining three commissioners, all serving on expired terms and are years overdue for replacements.\n\nDuring her 17 years on the commission, Weintraub said she\u2019s seen a dramatic shift away from compromise in favor of party-line votes.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been there at a time when it\u2019s kind of like watching the Wicked Witch of the West melt: this long, tedious process of watching the agency melt,\u201d McGehee said. \u201cIt really galvanized her.\u201d\n\nThe problems started in 2008, Weintraub said, when the commission dwindled to two and lost quorum for six months. The three Republicans who joined the reconstituted panel \u2014 one who was former White House counsel Donald McGahn \u2014 were loud proponents of deregulation and voted as a bloc, she said, making it difficult to get the required four votes on a given issue.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen I first started here, I always thought that was the best part of the job, trying to find a deal,\u201d Weintraub said. \u201cIt just got to be almost impossible to do that. Because those three didn\u2019t want the agency to be doing much, that was fine with them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrevor Potter, a Republican and former FEC chair who was appointed by George H.W. Bush, defended Weintraub and applauded her leadership, saying conservatives have for the past 10 years prevented the commission from enforcing the law.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s commission is riven by a deep, philosophical divide over whether they should do their job or not,\u201d said Potter, now the president of Campaign Legal Center, which advocates for stricter regulation of money in politics.\n\n\u201cIf they had their way, they wouldn\u2019t have an FEC,\u201d he said of Republicans.\n\nBut Hunter has rejected that criticism, saying the FEC should \u201cenforce campaign finance laws as written and as interpreted by the courts, not as the speech police wish them to be.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t interpret the law the way they do, you\u2019re wrong and you\u2019re not enforcing the law,\u201d she said.\n\nThe upshot to this deep ideological disagreement, Weintraub said, is that enforcement actions, fines and rulings have all slowed down. It\u2019s the same story as the one that has played out in Congress and in other corners of American governance over the past several years \u2014 institutions crippled by gridlock.\n\n\u201cWe got there first,\u201d Weintraub said of the FEC. \u201cWe were the canary in the coal mine on this.\u201d\n\nWeintraub said the news cycle has pushed her to become more vocal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a moment where understanding campaign finance law is critically important,\u201d Weintraub said. \u201cYou pick up the newspapers almost any day and campaign finance issues are on the front pages, and I just want people to understand what the rules are \u2014 and, hopefully, to follow them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn June, after Trump told ABC News that he would accept information on a political opponent from a foreign government, Weintraub tweeted out a statement, reiterating that \u201cElectoral intervention from foreign governments has been considered unacceptable since the beginnings of our nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would not have thought that I needed to say this,\u201d she added.\n\nThen two weeks ago, Trump both defended his request that Ukraine investigate his potential 2020 campaign rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter and called on China to investigate the family, too.\n\nWeintraub retweeted her June statement, writing \u201cIs this thing on?\u201d next to a microphone emoji.\n\nThose tweets prompted more criticism from the right, including Brad Smith, chairman of the Institute for Free Speech and a former outspoken Republican FEC chair who worked with Weintraub on the commission in the early 2000s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not her job to be tweeting that out,\u201d said Smith, who has publicly called for Weintraub\u2019s resignation.\n\nHer timing suggests she\u2019s accusing Trump of breaking the law, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous thing for her to be doing in her position,\u201d Smith said. \u201cShe\u2019s supposed to be a relatively impartial quasi-judicial officer.\u201d\n\nRep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) asked the FEC\u2019s inspector general to investigate Weintraub, accusing her of using her office to advance a political agenda. But Weintraub has maintained that she\u2019s been more of an educator than a political rabble-rouser, saying she\u2019s trying to defend the country\u2019s democracy from the threat of foreign adversaries.\n\n\u201cI will not be silenced,\u201d she said, responding to Davis\u2019s Oct. 10 letter.\n\nEven though the FEC remains open with three commissioners and its regular staff, the lack of a quorum will continue to make it more difficult for the agency to monitor compliance with election law ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nBut, perhaps unsurprisingly, the way forward is politically fractious.\n\nOne option, said a senior GOP Senate aide, is to nominate a slate of six appointees and completely remake the panel, which means Democrats would also have to recommend a replacement for Weintraub.\n\n\u201cA clean slate of members will go a long way toward fixing some of the perceived dysfunction at the Commission,\u201d said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the deliberations.\n\nThe office of Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement that, \u201cWe are working to restore a quorum as quickly as possible.\u201d Schumer wants a fully functioning FEC before the 2020 election, the statement said.\n\nIn 2017, Trump nominated Texas attorney James E. \u201cTrey\u201d Trainor III to the commission, but the Senate has not held a confirmation hearing.\n\nA quorum would be a good start, said McGehee of Issue One. But there are longer-term fixes she said would make the FEC more effective, like requiring an odd number of commissioners to promote action, or outsourcing enforcement to administrative law judges.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet to fix it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut everybody knows it\u2019s beyond repair.\"", "description": "Her public comments have magnified the dysfunction at the top level of the elections watchdog.", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9umQeHTpmqgsukt-KCNXCWoUw8E=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FAGQTPWZOUI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
