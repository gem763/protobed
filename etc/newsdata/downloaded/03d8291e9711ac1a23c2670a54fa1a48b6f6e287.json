REUTERS/Ann Saphir\n\nCORPUS CRISTI, Texas (Reuters) - Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said on Friday he supports the \u201cmodest and limited\u201d interest-rate cuts that the U.S. Federal Reserve has delivered this year to keep a manufacturing slowdown due to weakening global growth amid rising trade tensions from affecting the rest of the economy.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that that weakness may seep into other parts of the U.S. economy, so that ultimately over the next several months, that weakness intensifies, and will ultimately catch up with the job markets, and will ultimately catch up and diminish consumer confidence, and maybe affect consumer behavior,\u201d Kaplan said at a lunch in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\n\u201cIf we wait to see evidence of a weakening consumer.. we\u2019ve waited too long....I would rather take action now, modest and limited action now.\u201d\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday cut its overnight policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point, targeting a range between 1.75% and 2.0%. The decision, taken to offset slowing global growth and risks associated with President Donald Trump\u2019s trade battles with China, drew three dissents out of 10 total votes.\n\nIt was the second Fed rate reduction this year, but part of a much larger shift since the start of 2019, when the Fed expected to be raising rates through the year.\n\nRelated Coverage Fed's Kaplan says he penciled in no further rate cuts in 2019\n\nKaplan said he sees the sharp decline in yields on U.S. Treasuries since last year as a sign of investor pessimism over long-run growth, but said he hoped the most recent rate cut will help \u201cnormalize\u201d what has been an inverted yield curve.\n\n\u201cTaking some action now to address this I think is wise, and that\u2019s why I advocated for it in July and September,\u201d he said.\n\nYields on most U.S. government debt remain below or at the bottom of the range of the Fed\u2019s newly lower target.", "description": "Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said on Friday he supports the \"modest and limited\" interest-rate cuts that the U.S. Federal Reserve has delivered this year to keep a manufacturing slowdown due to weakening global growth amid rising trade tensions from affecting the rest of the economy.", "authors": ["Ann Saphir", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432079851&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1X0", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
