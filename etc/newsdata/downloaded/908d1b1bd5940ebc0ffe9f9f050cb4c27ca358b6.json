She had to settle for bronze in the event at the 2016 Olympics and last year\u2019s world championships in Doha.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled with that performance, it was probably the highlight\u201d of the week.\n\nBiles worked hard on the beam to rebuild her confidence in the discipline, so \u201cto go out there and nail the routine felt really good\u201d.\n\nSunday\u2019s golds made Biles the most decorated gymnast in world championship history, surpassing the previous all-time record of 23 world medals won by men\u2019s star Vitaly Scherbo of Belarus in the 1990s.\n\nThis is the first time she has finished a world championships with five golds, but she has said she is \u201c99 percent\u201d sure Stuttgart will be her last.\n\nThe only blot on her near-perfect record in south-west Germany came in Saturday\u2019s uneven bars final when she finished fifth, but both Biles and her coach Laurent Landi were delighted with her week.\n\nLess than 10 months before the Tokyo Games, Biles is on course to retain the Olympic team, floor, vault and all-around titles she won in Rio.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s incredible, she was here to do a job and she did exactly what she trained for,\u201d said Frenchman Landi.\n\n\u201cShe has shown to herself and everybody else that she is consistent, not only in training, but when it counts.\n\n\u201cIf she does this for 12 more months, she will be very, very successful.\u201d\n\nLandi said the hard work Biles has also put into her mental preparation paid off as she patiently waited despite a lengthy delay before her floor routine while judges reviewed a rival\u2019s performance.\n\n\u2013 Mental edge \u2013\n\n\u201cIn her head, she\u2019s fine, doesn\u2019t get too upset, even if there are mistakes in training it doesn\u2019t bother her, so she was very confident for this final,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia\u2019s Nikita Nagornyy also stood out as one to watch in Tokyo next year by completing a hat-trick of gold medals, adding the men\u2019s vault title Sunday to his all-around and team success.\n\nThe 22-year-old finished just ahead of team-mate Artur Dalaloyan by 0.033 points in a repeat of Friday\u2019s all-around final where Nagornyy took gold and Dalaloyan, the men\u2019s 2018 world champion, silver.\n\nDalaloyan also took bronze on the horizontal bar, behind Brazilian gold medallist Arthur Mariano, for his fourth medal this week, completing the set after an all-around silver and team gold.\n\nJoe Fraser, the youngest competitor in the parallel bars field, said it was a \u201cdream come true\u201d to win Britain\u2019s second gold medal in Stuttgart.\n\nLess than 24 hours after Max Whitlock\u2019s pommel horse gold, Fraser pipped Turkey\u2019s Ahmet Onder on the bars by 0.017 points.\n\n\u201cWorld champion? It doesn\u2019t get better,\u201d said Fraser.", "description": "Stuttgart (Germany) (AFP) \u2013 US gymnastics star Simone Biles won her fifth gold medal in the women\u2019s floor final Sunday to conclude her", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/9b34d8_simone-biles-poses-her-gold-medals-world-gymnastics-championships-in-stuttgart-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
