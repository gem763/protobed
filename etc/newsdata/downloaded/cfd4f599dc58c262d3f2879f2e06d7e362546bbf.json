Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a top ally of Trump, introduced a resolution condemning the Democratic-controlled House for pursuing a \u201cclosed door, illegitimate impeachment inquiry.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is a co-sponsor of that measure.\n\nBut Graham also said he\u2019s talked to Mulvaney about what seems to be a lackluster White House pushback.\n\nDuring President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment, Graham said, \u201che had a team that was organized, had legal minds that could understand what was being said versus the legal proceedings in question. And they were on message every day.\u201d Republicans have been complaining for weeks that the Trump White House has no such defense system in place \u2014 partly a result of the inability to identify qualified talent but also Trump\u2019s own qualms about projecting concern in the face of the investigation.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re working on getting a messaging team together,\u201d Graham said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
