For instance, the company will soon let customers choose where their data is stored within Atlassian's global footprint. Customers will also gain the ability to customize the URL for their Jira and Confluence Cloud sites as a way to ensure trust brand familiarity for their end-users.\n\nMeanwhile, Atlassian is expanding the feature set for its admin command center Atlassian Access, with new tools for identity, data loss prevention, and suspicious activity detection. Updates include integration capabilities with Microsoft ADFS for single sign-on (SSO) and Google Cloud Identity for SSO and user provisioning. Additionally, admins will have access to new audit logs and analytics for greater visibility and control.\n\nThis latest platform update follows another significant set of feature enhancements that Atlassian announced in April. The updates included new incident management capabilities and integrations across the Atlassian platform, a revamped user experience and 15 new features for Confluence, and performance and infrastructure enhancements to the company's self-managed enterprise offering.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE:", "description": "The update includes a new feature set for its admin command center Atlassian Access, with tools for identity, data loss prevention, and suspicious activity detection.", "authors": ["Natalie Gagliordi"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/05/48c6a839-9e24-4065-824f-1c9389d88ae3/thumbnail/770x578/d346423f7f1ba524832e170093a2ae48/atlassian-cloud-premium-website-short-version.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
