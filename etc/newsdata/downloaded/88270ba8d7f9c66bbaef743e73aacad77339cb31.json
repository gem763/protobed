REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe following explains the nature of the investigation and how the televised announcement made by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi may move the process forward.\n\nWhat led to Tuesday\u2019s announcement?\n\nThe House move followed Trump\u2019s admission on Tuesday that he encouraged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic frontrunner in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonourable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of integrity of our elections,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cTherefore, today, I\u2019m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nTrump says that call was perfectly acceptable, and that he did not pressure the Ukrainian president.\n\nWeren\u2019t Democrats already conducting a kind of impeachment investigation?\n\nYes. The House Judiciary Committee has been investigating whether to bring charges, known as articles of impeachment, against Trump. The House\u2019s Democratic leadership has been cagey about whether that amounted to an actual impeachment investigation, however.\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Jerold Nadler said in a Sept. 13 appearance on CNN that the probe could be described as an impeachment investigation but added that was a \u201cmade-up term\u201d and that he was \u201cnot interested in the nomenclature.\u201d Other party leaders have said an impeachment investigation was not underway.\n\nFive other committees have been conducting their own investigations relating to Trump, including probes into his finances and his campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia.\n\nThe investigations, which Trump has called \u201cpresidential harassment,\u201d have moved slowly due to court battles over access to witnesses and documents.\n\nSo how does Pelosi\u2019s announcement change things?\n\nPelosi put a new label on the various investigations and, perhaps more importantly, erased any doubt that Democrats were pursuing impeachment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry,\u201d she said in her address.\n\nThe announcement moves the House closer to drafting articles of impeachment against Trump, according to Frank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri who has written a book about impeachment.\n\nPelosi has long opposed impeachment as a politically risky move unless investigators find powerful evidence of misconduct that can unify public opinion. Tuesday\u2019s address seemed to put her seal of approval on the process.\n\n\u201cAs majority leader, she has the de facto if not the legal power to keep the Judiciary Committee or any other committee from driving full bore toward impeachment,\u201d said Bowman. \u201cThat is the reality of the hierarchy of the House.\u201d\n\nOther impeachment experts said little has changed, however.\n\nThe announcement \u201cwas basically a press event with little or no practical or legal significance,\u201d said Ross Garber, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cThe House has not passed a resolution,\u201d Garber said. \u201cNo new powers were conferred on any committee. No new resources were allocated.\u201d\n\nWhat else might the announcement mean?\n\nPast court decisions make clear that Congress has a stronger claim to documents and testimony when it is conducting an impeachment investigation, rather than asserting its traditional oversight powers, Bowman said. That means Pelosi\u2019s announcement could help the House win its pending court battles with Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers argue in those lawsuits that the congressional investigations are just partisan attempts to make him look bad, so he does not need to produce witnesses and documents.\n\nThe Trump administration is also asserting that some information sought by Congress is protected by \u201cexecutive privilege,\u201d a legal doctrine that allows the president to keep secret the nature of communications with advisers.", "description": "The U.S. House of Representatives made headlines by formally launching an impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump, but there is debate among experts about the significance of the announcement.", "authors": ["Jan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433917068&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O273", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
