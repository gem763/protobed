It\u2019s because of his autism, his mom says.", "language": "en", "text": "She says the teacher told her that Nathan, Putnam\u2019s 5-year-old, was in need of a conversation about boundaries. He had hugged a child that day. When Nathan got home, Putnam told him that he couldn\u2019t hug other children because the teacher didn\u2019t allow it. Every explanation she gave to him, she said, was met with a \u201cwhy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnother call came the next day, after Nathan had allegedly kissed another child on the cheek. The teacher told Putnam that Nathan\u2019s behavior was unacceptable, according to Putnam. They planned to meet to go over Nathan\u2019s individualized education program.\n\nAD\n\nWhen they met, Nathan\u2019s kindergarten teacher and a special-education teacher expressed concerns about his walking around during instruction and lunch times, according to Putnam. They all agreed that Nathan would be paired with a monitor for his safety.\n\n\u201cWhen I left the meeting and came home, my phone started ringing,\u201d she said Friday in an interview. \u201cIt was a lady from child protective services.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe representative told Putnam that a report about Nathan had been received because he hugged children and kissed another student on the cheek. Putnam said she was also told that Nathan had been accused of looking under a teacher\u2019s dress.\n\n\u201cI said I just left the meeting, that she told me about him hugging a child and kissing a child,\u201d Putnam said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything about Nathan looking under her dress.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe school district denies allegations of wrongdoing and disagrees with how Nathan\u2019s family has framed the issue.\n\nTim Hansley, communications officer for Hamilton County Schools, said the district is bound by privacy laws that don\u2019t allow it to publicly discuss what happened in the classroom.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis family\u2019s characterization of the incident with their child at East Ridge Elementary does not capture the full context of the concerns expressed to them by the school,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt was not a hug or kiss that prompted the school to contact the family.\u201d\n\nHansley said that schools in the county report incidents to child services but that it\u2019s up to that department whether to act on those reports.\n\n[A medical condition or just a difference? The question roils autism community.]\n\nThe Tennessee Department of Children\u2019s Services is unable to comment on the matter because of child- and family-protection laws, said Jennifer Donnals, executive director of communications and legislation for the agency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cUnder Tennessee Department of Children\u2019s Services policy, the department does not normally substantiate children under the age of 12 as perpetrators of sexual abuse, except in extreme cases. Additionally, DCS policy states that in cases of alleged sexual abuse involving two or more children under 12 years old from different families, all of the children are treated as alleged child victims,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cTennessee law mandates any person suspecting child abuse or neglect must report it to DCS.\u201d\n\nAutism\n\nMost children on the autism spectrum start showing signs between 1 year and 18 months of age, according to data from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\n\nAD\n\nNathan\u2019s pediatrician diagnosed him as being on the spectrum several years ago, after Putnam, a nurse by trade, noticed he was showing signs. The same pediatrician explained autism to the Department of Children\u2019s Services representative in an interview on Sept. 18, Putnam said.\n\nAD\n\nAbout 1 in 59 children in the country have been recognized as having autism spectrum disorder, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network.\n\nThe CDC also reports that those on the spectrum are likely to be diagnosed with other neurological, developmental and psychiatric conditions.\n\nNathan also has phonological disorder, which causes children to not use some or all of the sounds of speech expected for their age group, according to Nicklaus Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s definition.\n\nAD\n\nPutnam said that he\u2019ll get really close to her when he wants to speak to her or gain her attention and that she has to remind him of personal space. It can also be challenging to understand Nathan as he tries to communicate his thoughts.\n\nAD\n\nUsing symbols, she calmed a nonverbal autistic boy on a plane. His dad was awestruck.\n\nNeeds\n\nAutism spectrum experts and researchers agree communicating boundaries can be more difficult when it involves a child who has autism and figuring out how to educate that child is an individualized process.\n\nHugging and kissing are actions that are part of development for 5-year-olds with or without autism, said Michael Kelley, executive director of the Scott Center for Autism Treatment at Florida Tech.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s appropriate at that age to start to teach every child the conditions under which it is okay to touch everybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cKids with autism will require some sort of teaching training beyond what other children without autism require.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s appropriate to assess whether a child like Nathan is actually making a sexual advance or whether he truly does not understand when someone does not want to be hugged. Having the correct fundamental framework can provide a clearer assessment of the root issue, which could be a lack of appropriate social skills, Kelley said.\n\nAD\n\nNathan wants to make friends, but he just doesn\u2019t understand how to go about doing that, Putnam said.\n\nUnderstanding implicit social norms and behaviors in different settings can be confusing to a child on the autism scale, said Mandy Rispoli, professor of special education and co-director of the Purdue Autism Research Center.\n\nAD\n\nApplied behavior analysis for a child struggling to understand social cues can be beneficial for children with autism. It can give those explicit instructions, model desired behavior and offer feedback that many children on the spectrum might need, she said.\n\n\u201cSometimes just verbally stating it isn\u2019t enough,\u201d she said, noting that it\u2019s best practice.\n\nPutnam said Nathan has been moved to another class where he can get the extra support that he needs. The teacher who reported him wasn\u2019t a special-needs instructor, she said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still telling him. Like this morning, I said, \u2018Nathan, have a good day. Remember, don\u2019t hug anyone\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cSometimes he\u2019ll say okay and sometimes he doesn\u2019t say anything at all.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nFlorida officer fired for \u2018traumatic\u2019 arrests of two 6-year-old students at school\n\nWhen your autistic child\u2019s biggest bullies are other parents\n\n\u2018I understand exactly who he is\u2019: Moms discover they share autism with their children\n\nFlight crew grounded, airline apologizes after family of passenger with autism complains about treatment", "description": "An autistic kindergartner in Tennessee could be in trouble for alleged inappropriate behavior.
