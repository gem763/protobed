Does she even realize what she\u2019s being asked here?\n\nFLAG: Senator Elizabeth Warren appears uncharacteristically flustered when asked if her ethics plan would allow her Vice President\u2019s son to serve on the board of a foreign company: \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean I\u2019d have to go back and look at the details.\u201d #nhpolitics pic.twitter.com/EksLlMEsew \u2014 Nicole Sganga (@NicoleSganga) September 25, 2019\n\nHer gut answer to the question she\u2019s asked is \u201cno\u201d \u2014 but then she backpedals. Did she backpedal because, as she thought further about it, she\u2019s not sure how a situation like that in the abstract should be handled?\n\nOr did she backpedal because \u2026 it suddenly dawned on her that she was being asked to attack Joe Biden for his dealings with Ukraine as vice president while Hunter Biden was sitting on the board of Burisma? That\u2019s not something Warren would want to do casually, in an offhand Q&A like this. If she\u2019s going to take the momentous step of joining Trump in criticizing the Bidens\u2019 relationship with Ukraine, she\u2019s going to do it after due deliberation, with some carefully chosen words.\n\nSpeaking of which, I don\u2019t understand this criticism of how Warren handled this:\n\nNow the news and social media are filled with questions about how Biden\u2019s son Hunter was even remotely qualified to receive hefty payments from Ukrainian companies. Perhaps there is an innocent explanation for it, but so far both Joe and Hunter Biden haven\u2019t provided any. Instead, candidate Biden has failed to react in the best way by choosing a public statement Tuesday where simply bashed President Trump and took no questions from the assembled news media. Just as Democrats in Congress are seeking to remove President Trump over allegations of improper dealings with the Ukrainian government, how in the world can the same party nominate a man accused of essentially doing the same thing?\u2026 But so far, Warren is showing signs she may fumble this opportunity. Warren was unable to give a definitive answer to a reporter Wednesday on whether she would allow something like it in her administration. If ever there was a time to take a page from President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign book and slam her main primary opponent, this is it.\n\nThe truth is the opposite: If there was ever a moment *not* to slam Biden, this is it. Why the hell would Warren want to join Trump\u2019s Biden attack when the politics of impeachment are uncertain and wildly in flux? For all she knows, Democratic voters might be indignant on Biden\u2019s behalf that Trump is attempting to turn his own scandal into a Biden scandal. Does she want to antagonize them? Also, the entire party will want Democratic presidential candidates to give Biden some space on the Ukraine issue for the moment so that its messaging efforts can be focused entirely on Trump. If Warren disrupts that by making common cause with the left\u2019s Orange Grinch, feeding oxygen to the fire Trump\u2019s trying to set about Biden instead of feeding oxygen to the fire Democrats are trying to set about impeachment, her party might never forgive her.\n\nLying low is precisely the right move. Especially since Trump\u2019s and right-wing media\u2019s attacks on Biden are bound to make their way to some Democratic voters organically, planting seeds of doubt about Biden in their minds. If Republicans are going to do her dirty work for her, Warren has no incentive to participate. Better just to sit back, tsk-tsk them perfunctorily for attacking poor Joe, and watch him immolate.\n\nAnd so, via the Free Beacon, her campaign is now predictably insisting that her policy would *not* bar the VP\u2019s children from sitting on a foreign company\u2019s board. The Bidens are in the clear!\n\nA Warren campaign spox on whether, under a Warren administration, her VP\u2019s child could serve on the board of a foreign company: \u201cThe [ethics] bill doesn\u2019t prevent any children of a VP from serving on a company\u2019s board.\u201d \u2014 Annie Linskey (@AnnieLinskey) September 26, 2019\n\nThe Free Beacon\u2019s David Rutz notes that Warren\u2019s website claims she\u2019ll ban \u201cthe practice of private lobbying for foreign governments, foreign individuals, and foreign companies,\u201d ridding Washington of \u201cK Street influence-peddlers looking out for the interests of China, Russia, or Saudi Arabia.\u201d In that case, though, why wouldn\u2019t she ban children of elected officials from working for foreign interests? The whole reason the Bidens\u2019 arrangement looks shady is that it appears from the outside as though Hunter was brought on as a director at Burisma in hopes that he might be able to influence his father in how policy towards Ukraine was set. If Warren\u2019s worried about influence peddling, obviously she should worry about a conduit through family members of top cabinet officials.\n\nExit quotation from former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko, who had previously accused Hunter Biden of wrongdoing: \u201cFrom the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything\u2026 Hunter Biden cannot be responsible for violations of the management of Burisma that took place two years before his arrival.\u201d", "description": "Hmmm!", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ew-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
