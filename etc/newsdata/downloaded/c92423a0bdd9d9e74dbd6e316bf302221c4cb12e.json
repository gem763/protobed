If true, this might explain why Matt Lauer managed to stick around for so long \u2014 and why Ronan Farrow\u2019s Pulitzer Prize report on Harvey Weinstein had to go outside of NBC News. According to his new book Catch and Kill, NBC News chief Andrew Lack \u201cpreyed on female underlings,\u201d as Page Six characterized it, and retaliated when the relationships soured:\n\nJane Wallace, an anchor on CBS\u2019s \u201cWest 57th\u201d news show when Lack was an executive producer in the late 1980s, discussed her affair with the then-married news man. Lack, 72, a close friend of ousted \u201cToday\u201d show anchor Matt Lauer who oversaw his 2017 termination, was \u201calmost unrelenting\u201d in asking Wallace out to dinner \u201cevery day for almost a month,\u201d saying he wanted to celebrate her contract, according to the book. \u201cIf your boss does that, what are you gonna say?\u201d Wallace told Farrow. \u201cYou know if you say \u2018I don\u2019t want to celebrate with you,\u2019 you\u2019re asking for trouble.\u201d\n\nAfter the sexual relationship ended, Wallace told Farrow that Lack bullied her out of her job. Eventually she signed an NDA and took a cash settlement, which rankles her to this day. Another woman, associate producer Jennifer Laird, told Farrow that Lack retaliated against her too \u2014 in a very controlling manner:\n\n\u201cWhen Laird asked to be reassigned, Lack wouldn\u2019t allow it,\u201d Farrow wrote. \u201cHe compelled her to work longer hours, and on weekends, and proposed she cancel vacations.\u201d Laird confirmed the relationship to Farrow, telling the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, \u201cThere\u2019s clearly a reason you don\u2019t get involved with your boss.\u201d\n\nTrue enough, but that raises an important question. Were these two relationships fully consensual at the beginning? If so, then these would look more like cases of bad judgment than predation, although that wouldn\u2019t explain away the retaliatory behavior (which Lack denies, and to which we\u2019ll get in a moment). In Page Six\u2019s brief characterization of Laird\u2019s recollection, it sounds as though it was fully consensual at the start, but Wallace casts considerable doubt on the issue. She calls the relationship \u201cultimately consensual,\u201d but that she got \u201cworked over\u201d to get to that consent.\n\nTwo cases are not exactly a pattern, but Farrow provides some secondary testimony that a pattern was apparent enough within NBC News. Lack had been brought back as president of NBC News in 2015 to deal with the fallout of the Brian Williams fabulism scandal, which surprised at least one executive who recalled the move:\n\n\u201c\u2018Why would you do that?\u2019 one executive recalled asking [NBCUniversal CEO] Steve Burke upon learning of his decision to reinstate Lack,\u201d the book said. \u201c\u2018The reason you have those cultural problems down there \u2014 he created that!\u2019\u201d\n\nIf this is all true, then it\u2019s not too difficult to understand why Farrow\u2019s blockbuster report on Weinstein would have held little interest for Lack. It went beyond protecting his investment in Lauer, whose own predatory behavior had been tolerated both before and after Lack\u2019s return to NBC News. It would have cast a light on Lack\u2019s own alleged environment of harassment, especially if Weinstein got nasty in fighting back \u2014 which he did, according to Farrow, a factor in Lack\u2019s decision to spike his story:\n\nIn his soon-to-be-released book \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d journalist Ronan Farrow claims that Harvey Weinstein used allegations against Matt Lauer as leverage to suppress stories about himself, by making it known to the network that he was aware of Lauer\u2019s alleged behavior and capable of revealing it. One of the stories NBC allegedly suppressed was Farrow\u2019s own Weinstein expose. Farrow eventually took the story to The New Yorker.\n\nFor his part, Lack angrily denied Farrow\u2019s allegations yesterday in an internal memo also reported by Page Six. He denied having tried to kill the Weinstein story for personal reasons, and also accused Farrow of lacking respect for his former colleagues in writing the book \u2014 some of them, anyway:\n\n\u201cIt disappoints me to say that even with passage of time, Farrow\u2019s account has become neither more accurate, nor more respectful of the dedicated colleagues he worked with here at NBC News. He uses a variety of tactics to paint a fundamentally untrue picture,\u2019\u2019 Lack seethed in a memo sent to staffers. \u2026 \u201cAfter seven months, without one victim or witness on the record, [Farrow] simply didn\u2019t have a story that met our standard for broadcast nor that of any major news organization. \u201cNot willing to accept that standard and not wanting to get beaten by the New York Times, he asked to take his story to an outlet he claimed was ready to publish right away. Reluctantly, we allowed him to go ahead,\u2019\u2019 Lack wrote. \u201cFifty-three days later, and five days after the New York Times did indeed break the story, [Farrow] published an article at the New Yorker that bore little resemblance to the reporting he had while at NBC News.\u201d\n\nNot noted in Lack\u2019s memo, of course, is that Farrow did talk with a few of his \u201cdedicated colleagues\u201d at NBC \u2014 the ones who had affairs with Lack, for instance. Farrow\u2019s reps shot back later in the day:\n\n\u201cThe claims by NBC\u2019s senior management about Ronan Farrow\u2019s reporting are simply not true, as his book will methodically demonstrate. In fact, relevant sections of the book confirm not only how many women were named, but also how much proof Ronan had gathered. \u201cImportantly, it documents the lengths to which NBC executives went to thwart the reporting efforts of Ronan and his producer Rich McHugh and why they did so. That is why [the book] is called Catch and Kill.\u201d\n\nNBC News has been flogging that excuse ever since the Farrow report went live. It\u2019s never made much sense. If the story wasn\u2019t ready for air at the time, why not actively help develop it rather than kill it? Even accepting Lack\u2019s explanation, the New Yorker helped Farrow develop it and it won a Pulitzer, so clearly they recognized the value of Farrow\u2019s reporting at the time he brought it to their editors. Why didn\u2019t Lack, who runs one of the nation\u2019s biggest news outlets? He makes it sound almost as though Farrow wanted the story to go elsewhere, but that doesn\u2019t make much sense either. Are we to believe that Farrow would have rather had his story appear in a well-respected but somewhat niche magazine than on a broadcast network television show with an instant reach to tens of millions of people?\n\nFor the moment, this is a credibility contest. Both sides have their issues in that regard (thanks to Farrow\u2019s irresponsible reporting on the Deborah Ramirez claims in the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation cycle), but the hushed-up goings-on at NBC News for the last few years puts Lack behind the credibility eight-ball in this case.", "description": "\"The reason you have those cultural problems down there \u2014 he created that!\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lack.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
