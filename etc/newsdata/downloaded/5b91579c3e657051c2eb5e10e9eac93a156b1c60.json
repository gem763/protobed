The resources will help double the government\u2019s investigative work in the area. (The Guardian)\n\nTalking point: The effort is part of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s Christchurch Call, a global crisis-response framework to eliminate online terrorist and extremist content that came seven months after the worst mass shooting in the country\u2019s history was livestreamed on Facebook and shared on Twitter, YouTube, WhatsApp and Instagram. Fifty companies and countries, including Canada, have signed on. New Zealand\u2019s sovereign wealth fund launched its own initiative, in which financial institutions have put pressure on tech companies to cull hateful online content. Last week, a gunman livestreamed an attack on a German synagogue on Amazon\u2019s Twitch. Amazon, which joined the Christchurch Call two weeks earlier, was able to use the initiative\u2019s crisis-response tools to limit the video\u2019s spread, said Ardern.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
