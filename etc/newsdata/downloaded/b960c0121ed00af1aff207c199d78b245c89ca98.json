Equally, while no actual harm was caused the offences demonstrate a serious risk of harm in the context of terrorism.'\n\nBarnes failed to tell police about a Blackberry phone, where he concealed details of contacts, an iPhone and a Vauxhall car.\n\nPolice found him with the two unregistered phones and discovered he had used them 4,000 times over a four to five-month period.\n\nHe has amassed 27 convictions for offences including 'inciting the murder of servicemen in foreign conflicts and where he glorified the murder of Lee Rigby,' said Mark Dawson, prosecuting.\n\nBarnes (left) is a friend of one of Lee Rigby's killers, Michael Adebolajo (Lee Rigby, pictured right)\n\n'Mr Barnes pleaded guilty to the seven charges on the 25 September and was sent to this court,' said Mr Dawson.\n\n'The background is this, he was convicted on the 14 March 2014 receiving a 64-month custodial penalty.\n\n'The qualifying period for that conviction is one of 15 years. He was first released from that sentence in September 2016. He was recalled to prison for breaching his licensing conditions.\n\n'The licensing condition he breached was having an internet enabled mobile phone.\u2019\n\nHe added that on his release on March 3 he was handed back the phone that had led to his recall.\n\nRoyal Barnes is pictured laughing hysterically as he drives past the memorial for Lee Rigby in Woolwich, east London\n\n'When released he is required to notify within three days various requirements. He declared an email address, a mobile phone, a NatWest account, a change of address and the purchase of a vehicle.\n\n'He was stopped on 30 August by police in another vehicle he did not declare. The iPhone was found in his hand and the Blackberry was found in his home address.\n\n'In his wallet there were two bank cards he did not declare.\n\nBarnes was banned from approaching people in public to promote Sharia Law or distributing leaflets for their cause even if they are outside a mosque.\n\nBarnes is also banned from distributing videos promoting Sharia Law.\n\n'Convictions 14 and 15 relate to people including the defendant himself, what was described as Sharia Patrols in east London, approaching members of the public and threatening them for not complying with Sharia Law.\n\n'There is just a long history of deliberate disregard for court orders. It is quite clear that his lack of notification is deliberate. It is repeated and it is ongoing.'\n\nThe religious vigilante group's activities were exposed in YouTube where they dubbed women as 'slags' and used a megaphone to scream 'kill the non-believers' at innocent bystanders.\n\nTwo victims, Joshua Bilton and Anna Reddiford, were told to stop holding hands by Horner and Barnes as they walked down the street in Bethnal Green.\n\nRingleader: Jordan Horner, known as Jamal Uddin, was jailed for six weeks in July last year for beating up a photographer and causing \u00a33,000 of damage to a car in an attack in Walthamstow, east London\n\nHorner yelled through a megaphone: 'Let go of each other's hands. This is a Muslim area!'\n\nIn a second incident, on January 6, 2013, Horner and MacFarlane attacked a group of men drinking in the streets of Shoreditch, east London.\n\nThey screamed 'kill the non-believers' as Horner punched James Forward in the jaw and knocked out Patrick Kavanagh with a sucker punch to the head.\n\nIn December 2013 Ricardo MacFarlane was jailed for 12 months. McFarlane of Walthamstow, east London, whose real name is Ricardo Langaigne pleaded guilty to affray, and has previous convictions for criminal damage for painting over advertisements of women in the street\n\nA week later Horner and Barnes confronted another couple, Clare Coyle and Robert Gray, walking in the street in Stepney, east London.\n\nBarnes accused Miss Coyle of dressing inappropriately in a Muslim area and that she would be punished in 'hell fire'.\n\nHorner then started filming the event on his mobile phone and branded Clare Coyle a 'slag', leading to her insisting: 'This is Great Britain. I can dress how I wish.'\n\nIn the video, which was later uploaded on to YouTube, the group can be heard shouting: 'You need to control this area and forbid people from exposing themselves outside the mosque.\n\n'Remove yourselves now. Muslim Patrol. Move away from the mosque. Don't come back. We don't respect those who disrespect God.'\n\nIn December 2013, Judge Rebecca Poulet QC had jailed Horner for 68 weeks, MacFarlane for 12 months, and Barnes for 24 weeks.\n\nBarnes was then jailed for 64 months in March 2014 for glorifying Lee Rigby's murder and filming himself laughing hysterically while driving past the scene of the gruesome killing.\n\nHorner had admitted two charges of assault and two charges of using threatening words and behaviour.\n\nMcFarlane had admitted affray, and has previous convictions for criminal damage for painting over advertisements of women in the street.\n\nBarnes, of Chingford, east London, admitted seven counts of failing to comply with notification requirements under the Counter-Terrorism act 2008.\n\nHe was sentenced to three years imprisonment at the Old Bailey today.", "description": "Royal Barnes, who would go on 'Muslim Patrol' in east London, has been jailed for secretly keeping two phones and two banks cards after his release from prison.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19400882-0-image-a-79_1570462202413.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
