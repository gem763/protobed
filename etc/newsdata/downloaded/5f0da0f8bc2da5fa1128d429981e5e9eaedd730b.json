News reported: \u201cIf mankind\u2019s so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good, this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what he means: If scientists, researchers and technological wizards don\u2019t consider the ethical and moral sides of what they\u2019re advancing, then humanity will take a back seat to progress. The less fortunate, the less intelligent, the less creative, the less all-around capable will become swept to the side, the shoulder-shrugging byproduct of continuous competitive computer advancement.\n\nThis is true.\n\nThis is a real societal danger.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen a taste of this sweeping in the business sector where human workers are being replaced with rising frequency with machines. Think retail and self-checkout lines; think customer service and online chatbots.\n\nTechnology has its many positives, but it also forces workers to retrain, re-educate and reevaluate how they might stay relevant \u2014 not to mention cost-efficient, in comparison to machines.\n\nNot all are up to the task.\n\nSo as a solution, some Democrats, some Republicans and almost all the socialists and progressives and elitists in the scientific community suggest the implementation of a universal basic income \u2014 a sort of set salary for those displaced by, say, robots. A salary for the sake of being alive.\n\nA salary that depends nothing on ability and everything on entitlement.\n\nBut this is not the answer \u2014 particularly in America, where the free market is supposed to reign, and where the prices for goods and services \u2014 and by logical extension, profits \u2014 are driven by demand.\n\nThe pope, in his remarks, didn\u2019t mention job displacement. He focused instead of fake news \u2014 on what he called \u201cfalse data\u201d from A.I.-fueled online sites that \u201ccould poison public debates and even manipulate the opinions of millions of people, to the point of endangering the very institutions that guarantee peaceful civil coexistence.\u201d\n\nAnd no doubt, knowing this pope, knowing his leftist way of thinking \u2014 his embrace of climate change regulation, his push for open borders around the world, his barely concealed contempt for President Donald Trump \u2014 he probably meant \u201cfake news\u201d as code for conservative.\n\nBut he still has a point.\n\nThe pope, warning about the barbaric conditions of societies that embrace technology over humanity, sounds an important alarm.\n\nArtificial intelligence absent moral and ethical people will doom humanity to dark ages.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
