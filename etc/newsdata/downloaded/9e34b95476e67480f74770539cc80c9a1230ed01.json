There is a risk of some students self-harming, or some students finding themselves in a desperate situation and taking their own lives.\"\n\nHe pointed out that students paying high fees had every reason to expect a duty of care from their universities.\n\nHe is calling for a legally binding charter with minimum standards that universities are required to meet, so parents know their adult children will be safe.\n\nA spokesman for Universities UK said: \"Funding to support mental-health services at universities will vary depending on the needs of each student population.\n\n\"Universities cannot address these challenges alone.\n\n\"The NHS must provide effective mental-health care to students, and Universities UK is working closely with NHS England to ensure that commitments in the NHS long-term plan are implemented.\"", "description": "A former health minister wants universities to be bound by law to meet students' mental-health needs.", "authors": ["Hannah Richardson", "Bbc News Education", "Social Affairs Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11FF8/production/_108802737_ceareared.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
