Coal still played a key role in the country's energy generation mix. In addition, SA earned R80bn from coal exports in 2018, and coal mining and related industries employ about 285 000 people.\n\n\"The reality in South Africa, and many other emerging markets, is that coal capacity is still needed in the short to medium term, particularly when balancing social, economic and environmental considerations\".\n\nIn late November, when FirstRand holds in annual general meeting in Sandton, shareholders will get to a vote on a few climate change related resolutions. These include making public by October 2020 the assessment of its exposure to climate change related risks, and publishing its official policy on lending to fossil fuel-related projects.", "description": "The group's chair says it will limit new coal financing to below 0.5% of total loans and advances.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8606/5509fecb47b84af5879b5b5041e4100a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
