Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-MA) campaign dismissed his concerns that Warren had not done enough to \u201cright the harm she has caused\u201d by falsely claiming Cherokee heritage for years, and added that the staffer\u2019s claim \u2013 that Trump will be re-elected if he does not support Warren \u2013 is \u201cprofoundly colonial.\u201d\n\nThe professor and member of Cherokee Nation, Joseph Pierce, said on Twitter Saturday that Warren staffers attempted to persuade him to vote for the presidential hopeful during a campaign drive. Pierce told one staffer that he was not happy with the way Warren falsely claimed Native American heritage, and noted that she had not \u201cdone enough to right the harm she has caused.\u201d\n\nThe staffer told Pierce that he would get him in touch with someone \u201cwho could get the word to Elizabeth\u201d and brought him to another staffer, whom Pierce described as a \u201cwhite guy with a beard.\u201d The professor told the staffer that he was Cherokee, but the conversation was seemingly cut short after the staffer asked for Pierce\u2019s number so he could \u201cmake real time\u201d for him.\n\n\u201cI say, \u2018this really pisses me off.\u2019 And then things change: he can see that I\u2019m upset, and then tries to figure out if I am worth talking to after all,\u201d Pierce wrote on Twitter, adding that the staffer ultimately said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure there is anything I can do for you.\u201d\n\nPierce said he told the staffer, \u201cTell her, tell someone, that what she has done is not enough.\u201d\n\nHe noted the fact that the staffer was not as interested in talking to him once he realized he had passionate thoughts on the issue.\n\n\u201cI mean, bro, just one second earlier you were willing to \u2018make real time for me,\u2019 and when you saw that I actually have thoughts about this, you no longer have that willingness or that time,\u201d Pierce wrote. \u201cThat, my friend, is exactly the problem.\u201d\n\nPierce added that the staffer told him that, by not voting for Warren, Trump would be re-elected. He called the staffer\u2019s assertion \u201cprofoundly colonial.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the position they are putting us in, and it is profoundly colonial,\u201d he assessed. \u201cProfoundly\u201d:\n\nthe guy said that he would take me to someone \"who could get the word to Elizabeth.\" Intrigued, I go with him, and its a white guy with a beard, and we interrupt his conversation, because its important, and I say, \"I'm Cherokee\" and he nods\u2026 \u2014 Joseph M. Pierce (@PepePierce) October 5, 2019\n\nHe says, \"I'm not sure there is anything I can do for you\". And it dawns on me, yes, I am upset, perhaps I'm not willing to have this conversation, perhaps I just want to yell. So I say, \"tell her, tell someone, that what she has done is not enough.\" \u2014 Joseph M. Pierce (@PepePierce) October 5, 2019\n\nAnd he had the gall to say that if I didn\u2019t vote for her it was going to get Trump re-elected. This is the position they are putting us in, and it is profoundly colonial. Profoundly. \u2014 Joseph M. Pierce (@PepePierce) October 6, 2019\n\nPierce blasted the \u201capology\u201d Warren offered at the Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum in August, calling it \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d:\n\nSo, I didn\u2019t expect Warren to spell out the complex history of Cherokee identity, the background of the allotment era and the theft of Indian land, identity, language, and culture by white settlers\u2014including members of her own family. I didn\u2019t expect her to be nuanced. But I hoped she might actually say, simply, that she is not and never has been Cherokee. That was my hope. And I was disappointed. Warren vaguely admitted wrongdoing. But she did not say what she did or why, quickly pivoting to her strong suit, public policy. This is a good strategy for courting people who wanted to hear her admit something. However, it doesn\u2019t address the central issue at stake\u2014Cherokee sovereignty.\n\n\u201cLike anyone who\u2019s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,\u201d Warren told the crowd at the forum. \u201cI am sorry for harm I have caused\u201d:\n\nWarren \u2013 who identified as a minority professor and listed herself as an \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d on her Texas Bar registration card \u2013 has failed to go into detail on her false claims to Native American heritage, offering vague apologies and largely avoiding the subject. The results of Warren\u2019s DNA test released last year revealed the presidential hopeful\u2019s lack of Native American heritage.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nWarren has tried to put her claims of Native American heritage behind her, but a DNA test \u2013 taken last year \u2013 revealed that Warren had between 1/64th and 1/1,024 Native American ancestry. The results followed years of Warren\u2019s claims of Native American heritage, citing her high cheekbones as physical proof. Additionally, the DNA results indicated an association with individuals from Colombia, Mexico, and Peru\u2013 not Native American tribes in the United States, further debunking her claims of Cherokee heritage, specifically.\n\nA recently resurfaced video from Warren\u2019s 2012 senatorial bid shows the lawmaker claiming to have \u201cplenty of pictures\u201d reflecting her Native American heritage but ultimately refusing to show them to the reporter.\n\n\u201cI have plenty of pictures,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThey\u2019re not for you.\u201d", "description": "A Cherokee professor at Stony Brook University claimed that a staffer from the Warren campaign dismissed his concerns.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1179050364-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
