And when people like it, and it\u2019s actually good ratings, that\u2019s even better. And if it like, has social ramifications, that\u2019s even more exciting,\" said actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson. \"I don\u2019t think any of us were expecting to have the impact that it did.\"\n\nSince \"Modern Family\" premiered in 2009, the show has received critical acclaim for building stories around different types of families and tackling issues on parenting, gay marriage and adoption.\n\nEvan Agostini/Invision/AP\n\nWorking on a show with those themes in mind has meant a lot for the actors who portrayed the show\u2019s characters.\n\nFerguson, who portrays Mitchell Pritchett, a gay father to adopted children in the sitcom, said, \"Looking for role models on television, not necessarily finding them, I love that we can be that to kids now. And I think it\u2019s been a talking point for a lot of families about what it means to be gay. And I love the relationship. I\u2019m so proud of it -- the relationship that Eric and I had created.\"\n\nEric Stonestreet, who plays Cameron Tucker, Ferguson\u2019s partner on the show, said it was important for him to not let his character\u2019s sexuality be the thing that defined him.\n\n\"Jesse gave me the very sage advice from the beginning,\" said Stonestreet. \"He\u2019s like, 'We're never gonna please everyone, so just take that off your list of worries.'\"\n\nWith the impact that the show has had on fans around the world, and years of syndication in its future, it\u2019s no question that \"Modern Family\" will continue to have a lasting impression on generations to come.\n\n\"It\u2019s really brought families together in an age where kids and teenagers can be so separated from their families because of things like social media and phones and computers,\" said star Sarah Hyland.\n\n\"We all have 10-year-old kids that come up to us and say, 'Are you the guys on Modern Family?\u2019 That\u2019s the lasting impact -- these people are coming up to me that weren\u2019t born when I started this job,\" said Stonestreet. \"So I have to assume in 10 years there\u2019s gonna be another 10-year-old. And we\u2019re gonna keep making hopefully generations laugh.\"\n\nThe final season of \"Modern Family\" premieres on Wednesday, Sept. 25 at 9 p.m. ET on ABC.", "description": "The cast of 'Modern Family' reflects the show's 10 years on television and the show's impact on their audience.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/modern-family-01-as-abc-190924_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
