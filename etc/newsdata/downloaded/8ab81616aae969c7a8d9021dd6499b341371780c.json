See a full list of Nobel laureates here: here\n\nTheir work centres on the hypoxic response \u2013 the way the body reacts to oxygen flux \u2013 and \u201crevealed the elegant mechanisms by which our cells sense oxygen levels and respond\u201d said Andrew Murray, an expert at Britain\u2019s University of Cambridge who congratulated the three.\n\nRandall Johnson, a professor at Sweden\u2019s Karolinska Institute where the annual prize is awarded, noted that since \u201coxygen is essential for life and is used by virtually all animal cells,\u201d the work is central to how the body functions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a prize that really tells us the fundamental truth about how cells work,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example when you\u2019re exercising, you\u00b4re using up oxygen at a much more rapid pace \u2026 and this is a switch that helps the cell figure out how much oxygen it\u2019s getting and how it should behave.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you have a stroke there\u2019s suddenly no oxygen going to the brain\u2026 Those cells, if they are going to survive, need to find a way to adapt to that level of oxygen,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cALMOST SPEECHLESS\u201d\n\nMedicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes given each year. The prizes for achievements in science, peace and literature have been awarded since 1901 and were created in the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel.\n\nNobel medicine laureates have included scientific greats such as Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, and Karl Landsteiner, who identified separate blood types and so enabled safe transfusions to be widely introduced.\n\nPerlmann said he had reached Kaelin by phone early on Monday, after first having dialled the wrong number.\n\n\u201cHe was really happy, almost speechless,\u201d Perlmann said.\n\nRatcliffe was at his office and Semenza was asleep, he said.\n\nLast year American James Allison and Japanese Tasuku Honjo won the prize for discoveries about how to harness the immune system in cancer therapies.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "The 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded jointly to William G.
