Authorities say that's when a stranger, described as a light-skinned, possibly Hispanic male wearing orange shoes, lured her into the back of his red van and drove off.\n\nCumberland County Prosecutor Jennifer Webb-McRae urged the man to step forward so authorities can ask about the girl's whereabouts.\n\nNEW JERSEY COPS SEARCH FOR GIRL, 5, LAST SEEN AT PLAYGROUND\n\n\"We are attempting to identify a male who was in the park at the time Dulce went missing,\" Webb-McRae said at a press conference Thursday. \"We need to speak to this person and feel that he may have information that will greatly assist us in this investigation. This person may not even realize that they have important information that may be able to help us locate Dulce.\"\n\nLocal, state and federal investigators used a helicopter, a dive team, sonar and bloodhounds to scour the neighborhood as an Amber Alert remained in effect for a fourth day.\n\nBridgeton Police have been attempting to contact the girl\u2019s father, who lives in Mexico, as they explore every possibility, Fox 29 reported.\n\nAlavez, a Hispanic girl, is roughly 3-foot-5 with a medium build.

Her dark-colored hair was in a ponytail.\n\n\"Please, if you have any information, help us find my granddaughter,\" Alavez's grandmother, speaking in Spanish, said through tears. \"Do not be afraid of the police. We have not been able to eat nor sleep. You can't imagine what we are going through. We are very sad. Please help our family, I beg of you.\"\n\nThe prosecutor's office said anyone with information shouldn't fear coming forward.
