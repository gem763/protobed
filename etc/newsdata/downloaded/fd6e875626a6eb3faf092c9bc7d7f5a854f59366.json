making it feel impossible to build even a 5% deposit.\n\nAnd across the UK, the typical buyer will need to put down \u00a323,271 in cash to get their foot on the ladder - worrying, given that average salaries are currently \u00a329,588.\n\nBut, you may be able to snap up a property for less than half of that if you narrow down your search in the right direction.\n\nWhile the average home in the UK costs \u00a3232,574, according to the latest Halifax house price report, there are places where you can still net a home for half of that.\n\nThose looking to put in the work - and possibly the commute - could bag homes for \u00a3100,000 or less in some parts of the UK, where it's still possible to get on the ladder on an average UK salary.\n\nBelow, we've pulled out 10 Zoopla properties for sale right now - with an asking price of \u00a3100,000 or less.\n\nOn typical 10% terms, this averages out at a \u00a310,000 deposit - first time buyers won't be able to lower this to 5% though, as the properties aren't new builds on the Government's Help to Buy scheme.\n\n(Image: Zoopla)\n\nThis family home has amassed almost 2,500 views since being listed online - and given the price, it's easy to see why.\n\nIt has a driveway out the front, a good garden at the rear, and three nice sized bedrooms plus good living space downstairs.\n\nThe only catch could be that it is a leasehold property - and there is no indication how long the lease might have left on it.\n\nWhen you buy a leasehold home, you usually have to pay a ground rent and/or annual service charge to the freeholder - the person or company who owns the land your home stands on.\n\nWe've got a guide on what you need to know about leaseholds, here.\n\n(Image: Zoopla)\n\nYou'll need \u00a3100,000 in cash to get your hands on this Willenhall home - but if you can afford it, you could be locking in a steal.\n\nBut be aware, it has only 38 years left on the lease, so you would need to find out how much it costs to extend the lease if you wanted to buy it - and any lease with less than 80 years left on it can be pricey to extend.\n\nAlso, it is unlikely you would get a mortgage for this property without extending the lease so you would likely have to buy in cash.\n\n(Image: Zoopla)\n\nThis Liverpudlian property offers a lounge, dining room and extended kitchen, with three bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs.\n\nOutside, there is a driveway and gardens to the front, side and rear.\n\nBut, it's now under offer - which means you'll have to act fast if you're interested.\n\n(Image: Zoopla)\n\nAn offer has now been placed on this Birmingham home - which managed to ramp up \u00a34,828 views in just 30 days - but it does offer an idea of what you could get your hands on in the local area.\n\nThere is a spacious master bedroom upstairs, plus two more decent-sized bedrooms, and downstairs there is a separate bathroom and toilet.\n\nIt is a leasehold property, with around 99 years left on the lease, so it might be worth finding out whether the lease could be extended before you buy.\n\nPlus, you would have to factor in a ground rent cost of \u00a3750 a year.\n\n(Image: Zoopla)\n\nThis well presented family propery even boasts superfast broadband - perfect for anyone working from home or worried about falling into a blackspot zone.\n\nAt first glance, it looks in good condition, with a modern kitchen and bathroom, and it is not in a chain, but it is not clear whether it is a leasehold or a freehold house.\n\nThis could be the perfect house for a first time buyer that's willing to do some improvements before moving in.\n\n(Image: Zoopla)\n\nThree bedrooms, two receptions and even a shower room suite - this home sounds like the dream - but only if you've got cash in your pocket.\n\nThe listing specifies cash buyers only, suggesting it is either a leasehold property with a short lease, or has another problem which means mortgage companies will not lend against it.\n\nEither that or the seller is keen for a quick sale, so check first.\n\n(Image: Zoopla)\n\nThis property is in need of complete refurbishment throughout - making it ideal for anyone that's got time on their hands and not in a rush to move in.\n\nOn the plus side, it boasts a large reception room, separate kitchen, utility room, three bedrooms, bathroom and separate toilet, plus both front and rear gardens, the house is not lacking in space.\n\nThis freehold property is located in the popular area of Pennycross in Plymouth and is being sold with no onward chain, which could make for a less complicated process.\n\n(Image: Zoopla)\n\nIt's your last chance to put an offer in for this bargain \u00a340,000 property in Parkhouse, Glasgow, with offers closing on Wednesday.\n\nIt offers a generous master bedroom - but the second bedroom is quite narrow - so it might be worth checking how your furniture would fit in.\n\nBenefits include residents parking and a sizeable rear garden.\n\n(Image: Zoopla)\n\nThis Birmingham property is well located on the new development of HS2 Train station, Curzon St, which could send prices rocketing once it's up and running.\n\nIt needs stripping out and renovating inside, but it has two reception rooms, a kitchen and a toilet on the ground floor, plus two bedrooms and a bathroom on the first floor.\n\nPlus, due to HS2, it could make for a solid investment.\n\n(Image: Zoopla)\n\nThe agents have already said they've received an offer of \u00a343,750 for this little gem - but if you're keen, it may not be too late for a viewing.\n\nWith a large kitchen diner, plus a separate dining room and lounge, and three decent bedrooms, it could be good for a first-time buyer.\n\nPlus, it is also freehold and has no ongoing chain - making the sales process easier.", "description": "To help give you an idea of what's out there, here are property portal Zoopla's most viewed homes over the past month costing \u00a3100,000 or less", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Zoopla"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20582871.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Inside-the-family-sized-homes-under-\u00a3100000-around-the-UK.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
