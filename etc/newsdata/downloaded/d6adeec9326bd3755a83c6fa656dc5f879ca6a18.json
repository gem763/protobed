That prompted a confession from De Niro to his co-star:\n\nI said, \u201cThis is a great reaction, but it would be nice if they were here for a movie that we really feel proud about. Next time we\u2019ll do one we like.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2019. Their next collaboration, director Martin Scorsese\u2019s long-awaited gangster epic \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d is receiving very good early reviews.\n\nSo we figure that their new Netflix film, to open in November, combined with \u201cHeat\u201d (1995) and \u201cThe Godfather: Part II\u201d (1974) gives them a .750 batting average.\n\nThat\u2019s worthy of the Hall of Fame.", "description": "The actor recalled an awkward moment at a movie premiere with his fellow film legend.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d937f3b2200005c01dbea72.jpeg?cache=zbnfjpvba5&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
