But that vision for at least a half-point of U.S. cuts this year -- backed largely by a conviction that central banks globally will unleash more stimulus -- looks dicey after policy makers in Sweden, Canada and Australia pushed back last week.\n\nDoubts that the ECB will do all that\u2019s expected of it on Thursday have helped push government yields on both sides of the Atlantic up from multiyear lows in recent days. That could be the beginning of a sweeping recalculation for those heavily invested in central banks taking action to prevent a recession.\n\nIt appears likely that the Fed will next week cut rates by 25 basis points for the second time in 2019, but that looks unwarranted by U.S. economic data. And Jerome Powell\u2019s Fed looks more divided. While the decisions to hike rates nine times between 2015 and 2018 and pause early this year were unanimous, two voters dissented on the July cut. Further action may be harder to justify if the biggest fears driving defensive flows around the world -- the U.S.-China trade dispute, Brexit and Hong Kong\u2019s protests -- dissipate.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had a number of central banks and central bankers pushing the other way,\u201d said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer of BlueBay Asset Management, which oversees more than $60 billion. \u201cIn ordinary times, one would question whether the Fed would be thinking about cutting rates at the minute given that the outlook for the U.S. domestic economy is pretty healthy.\u201d\n\nData from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission released Friday showed speculative positioning across eurodollars -- the corner of the market most sensitive to immediate policy action -- is at record net-long levels.\n\nBut there are signs things are shifting. Traders in fed fund futures are now pricing in two Fed cuts between now and Dec. 31. Last month, three were almost fully factored in. Swaps tell a similar story, as do eurodollar futures, which just saw an aggressive sell-off amid reduced expectations for another ECB asset purchase program. Options traders are bracing for disappointment, snapping up hedges this week to protect against a scenario where the Fed cuts less than is priced in.\n\nAs markets prepare for a series of unpredictable events, some investors are taking to heart the comments from Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who managed to temper expectations somewhat last month at the central bank\u2019s annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nHe reminded markets that the Fed is balancing the global and domestic risks as they unfold, and taking \u201cour policy decisions one meeting at a time.\u201d Fittingly, that comment was soon overshadowed by the turmoil that followed President Donald Trump\u2019s tweet announcing more tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\n\u201cI believe Clarida when he says they\u2019re going to take this one meeting at a time, they\u2019re going to be data-dependent, but also trade war-dependent,\u201d said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco Ltd., which has close to $1.2 trillion under management.\n\nYields on 10-year Treasuries have reversed more than a third of their massive August drop, leaving them at 1.71% Tuesday. The two-year hit the highest level in a month on Tuesday. But it\u2019s hard to imagine rates rebounding much more while central-bank policy remains accommodative and markets are gripped by uncertainties over trade policy and the health of the global economy.\n\nTo J.P. Morgan Asset Management\u2019s David Kelly, a less-than-dovish ECB statement can keep yields from plumbing fresh lows. But the bigger move higher will be a more gradual process, he said, and probably not truly underway until global trade tensions are resolved, most likely not before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\n\u201cLonger term, we will see higher yields both in Europe and the U.S.,\u201d said Kelly, the chief global markets strategist at the $1.7 trillion asset manager. \u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of psychology and not a lot of rationality in the way that global bond yields are being set right now.\u201d\n\n(Updates yields in 11th paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Emily Barrett in New York at ebarrett25@bloomberg.net;Edward Bolingbroke in New York at ebolingbrok1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Nick Baker, Mark Tannenbaum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Mario Draghi\u2019s last act at the helm of the European Central Bank could be the beginning of the end for a massive consensus trade on U.S. interest rates.Bets on Federal Reserve easing are at all-time highs, according to speculators\u2019 latest positioning in short-term rates.
