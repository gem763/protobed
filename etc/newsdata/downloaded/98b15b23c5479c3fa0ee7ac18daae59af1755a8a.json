That got me thinking about all the special moments I experienced on the school bus as a kid.\n\nNow that I think about it, it wasn\u2019t my favourite time initially but things changed overtime and I realised its importance.\n\nPinterest\n\nOur day usually started off with a loud warning from dad: \u201cBus chhootni nahi chahiye!\u201d The fear was so real, it'd send us running in all directions and eventually to the bus stop where we'd wait for the bus to arrive.\n\nWhatever the time of day, our first thoughts while getting on the bus would be whether or not we'll find a seat in the last row. And if we were lucky enough to, it'd feel like one hell of an achievement. Had it not been for those last row seats, we'd probably not have any school bus memories to fall back on.\n\nLike who\u2019d want to sit in the middle or in the front row, anyway? Surprisingly for me, there were kids who used to prefer those seats. As you can imagine by now, I was never friends with them.\n\nDon't Miss 797 SHARES 662 SHARES\n\nClean uniforms and bright faces on, we'd all huddle together in the last row while riding to school. There we'd discuss the day's lunch, incomplete homework and the 'games' period that we were sure would make the day easier to deal with. Those were some of the most beautiful mornings of my life as a kid.\n\nIt was also the time when we'd revise for our unit tests and exams. That one ride would help me prepare me for the test better than I probably could ever manage at home.\n\ndesignindaba\n\nAnd then there was the ride back home from school...\n\nThe clean white shirts would by this time be stained and brown in colour, our faces now black and blue, our lunchboxes emptier than empty. We'd go running to the bus from class hoping to fetch the best seats for the ride back. Luckily for my friend and I, we'd always get the seats we wanted. There was endless laughter and yelling. There was food (from the canteen) again.\n\nWhile some students would stick their faces stuck outside the windows or just sleep, I was the one having fun rolling pens on their faces. We'd dance and sing in the back, we'd crack jokes and talk about our teachers. It was simply one of the best parts of school life.\n\nI now realise how those rides even gave me time to bond with other kids. Juniors, seniors, everyone, people I would've otherwise never talked to.\n\nPompom\n\nWriting about these memories makes me want to go back and board that school bus one more time and relive those memories.", "description": "Getting up early in the morning waiting for the bus to arrive because \u201cbus chhootni nahi chahiye\u201d used to be my dad\u2019s everyday warning.
