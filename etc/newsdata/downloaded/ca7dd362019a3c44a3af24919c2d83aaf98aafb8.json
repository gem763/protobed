This is serious.\n\nLast week, The Chase quizmaster Jenny Ryan floored viewers with her rendition of Somebody to Love while Martin Bashir had the nation in tears when he transformed into a genuine crooner, with a little nudge from his late brother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor some of the talent it\u2019s a second chance at superstardom, for others it\u2019s a personal Everest. For Ricki, it\u2019s another string to add to her bow but X Factor: Celebrity also came during a transformative chapter her life.\n\nBack in 2017, her husband Christian Evans committed suicide during an extensive battle with Bipolar disorder. She\u2019s since found love again and, in her own words, is \u2018taking charge\u2019.\n\n\u2018For me, after we did the show in July, I lost a lot of weight; I lost like 20 pounds, so I\u2019m feeling a lot better than watching myself on screen there,\u2019 she told press including Metro.co.uk after watching episode one.\n\nRicki is \u2018taking charge\u2019 (Picture: ITV/Rex)\n\nRicki\u2019s husband Christian Edwards passed away in 2017 (Picture: Rex Features)\n\n\u2018I was on a very restrictive diet for almost two months. I just really wanted to change my body. I lost my husband two and a half years ago, to mental illness and death by suicide, and for me I was carrying a lot of that grief in physical weight, and I was really ready to shed it, and so I just took the opportunity.\n\n\u2018I wanted to come back feeling and looking different, and I feel like I accomplished that. It\u2019s like a control thing. The one thing you can control, and it\u2019s empowering for me. And so I just feel a lot better. And so watching tonight, though I love the show, I think it\u2019s hilarious and so well done and I\u2019m so happy to be a part of it, it\u2019s hard for me to see myself.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nin turn, the process has been a therapeutic for one of the original councillors of daytime television.\n\n\u2018Yeah, for me [it has been], and I did The Masked Singer last year in the States, the first season, and that was very cathartic for me,\u2019 she explained. \u2018At this point in my career, I\u2019ve done a lot. I\u2019ve been around I think longer than anyone, [apart from] maybe Martin.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had a 30+ year career in the business, doing lots of different things, from talk shows to acting, not so much singing, but this is like another thing I get to try.\u2019\n\nX Factor: Celebrity continues tomorrow at 8.30pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
