Hyde, a veteran of World War II who fought in the battle for the Philippines, had an abiding personal interest in post-war political developments in Asia, including the challenges posed by a rising China. In his remarks, he saw political developments in Hong Kong as a key test as to whether Beijing would emerge as a responsible stakeholder or, alternatively, an authoritarian threat in the 21st Century.\n\nSpeaking of Hong Kong, he said: \u201cMany years ago, those laboring in mines deep underground, faced the deadly problem of the buildup of fatal but undetectable gases. To warn them of approaching danger, they would bring with them a small and fragile bird, imprisoned in a cage, which became known as the miners\u2019 canary\u2026Hong Kong is the miners\u2019 canary. Its vulnerability makes it an unmistakable indicator of the course of China\u2019s historic transition and the impact it will soon have on us all. We must watch carefully.\u201d\n\nHyde died in 2007. Yet his words of caution remain relevant for Americans today. These include President Trump who, according to a CNN report on October 4th, made another questionable promise on Hong Kong in one of his now-famous phone calls to global leaders: \u201cDuring a private phone call in June, President Donald Trump promised Chinese President Xi Jinping that the US would remain quiet on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong while trade talks continued.\u201d CNN further reported that the State Department told then-U.S. Consul General in Hong Kong, Kurt Tong, \u201cto cancel a planned speech on the protests in Washington because the President had promised Xi no one from the administration would talk about the issue.\u201d\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and NBA star LeBron James should also take heed. Their concerns for human rights and the rule of law are blinded by what Chairman Hyde called in his 2004 speech \u201cthe fool\u2019s gold of pure selfishness\u201d \u2013 in this case, the glitter of Chinese gold. Zuckerberg, seeking a breakthrough for Facebook in China after it was blocked in 2009, bought several copies of China strongman Xi Jinping\u2019s book on governance in 2014, so that \u201che and (his) colleagues could learn about socialism with Chinese characteristics,\u201d according to a December 9, 2014 article in the South China Morning Post.\n\nAnd LeBron James more recently got caught in the awkward position of appearing to excuse Beijing\u2019s current crackdown in Hong Kong in some ill-advised online comments. This happened soon after a high school student protester was shot in the chest by police on China\u2019s National Day, October 1st, in an eerie echo of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and prior to a leader of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement being hospitalized after an assault on the street by thugs with hammers. Commenting on LeBron James\u2019s remarks, one disappointed Hong Kong protester told the Associated Press on October 15th: \u201cPlease remember, all NBA players, what you said before: \u2018Black lives matter.\u2019 Hong Kong lives also matter.\u201d Perhaps all three -- Trump, Zuckerberg, and James -- need to take their quotes more from Chairman Hyde and a little less from Chairman Mao.\n\nThe spin doctors in Beijing did not care very much for what Hyde had to say in his speech. UPI reported on December 6, 2004 that a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that Hyde had \u201cviciously attacked China\u2019s development and progress, and insulted China\u2019s foreign policy from his own Cold World view.\u201d\n\nSo, what exactly did Hyde say about Hong Kong back in 2004 that drew such ire from Beijing? Hyde noted that \u201cin sharp contrast with Taiwan, where political reform and liberalization enjoyed sustained government sponsorship, in Hong Kong the push has had to come from the people themselves, with the government actively attempting to slow or stop altogether any further advance. I am certain that the standoff that has arisen is dispiriting to many here, especially as the prospects for further progress remain uncertain\u2026Clearly, the commitment to democracy has already sunk deep roots.\u201d\n\nIf the situation looked uncertain back in 2004, it looks downright gloomy in 2019. Reuters reported on September 30th that \u201clast month, Beijing moved thousands of troops across the border into this restive city. They came in on trucks, and armored cars, by bus and by ship. \u201c Three diplomatic envoys told Reuters that \u201cthe contingent of Chinese military personnel in Hong Kong had more than doubled in size since the protests began. They estimate the number of military personnel is now between 10,000 and 12,000, up from 3,000 to 5,000 in the months before the reinforcement. As a result, the envoys believe, China has now assembled its largest-ever active force of People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) troops and other anti-riot personnel and equipment in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nChairman Hyde foresaw this coming, as he remarked that \u201cHong Kong has become an arena for an unavoidable struggle, one with global implications, where rival forces are locked in a battle to determine which of their visions for China\u2019s political evolution will prevail...If we assume that chaos or repression are unacceptable outcomes to both sides, the question becomes: Is there a route by which Hong Kong can become increasingly free and democratic without challenging the regime\u2019s ultimate authority and thereby provoking a forcible response?\u201d Chinese leader Xi Jinping seemed to answer Hyde\u2019s question in the negative during a recent trip to Nepal. In the face of the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong, Xi warned that any effort to split China will result in \u201cbodies smashed and bones ground into powder,\u201d according to Hong Kong Free Press. Hyde concluded at the end of his speech, if the repression of civil liberties in Hong Kong was China\u2019s response, that \u201cenamored of an aggressive and intoxicating nationalism, it would soon wreak havoc on the world.\u201d\n\nOne result of the current political crisis in Hong Kong has been the exposure of Beijing\u2019s formula of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d as a fraud. Beijing has been steadily seeking to undermine this pledge made at the time of the 1997 reversion of Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule.\n\nUnder the Basic Law, based upon the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, Hong Kong was to be a special administrative region (SAR) with its own capitalist economic system, its own currency, its own legal and legislative system, and a guarantee of the people of Hong Kong\u2019s rights for fifty years. Yet Beijing and its surrogates in Hong Kong have sought to erode these guarantees by such means as the 2003 controversy over the since withdrawn national security measures contained in Article 23 of the Basic Law, the use of Hong Kong immigration to restrict entry of human rights critics of the Beijing regime, and the kidnapping of Hong Kong sellers of books banned in mainland China.\n\nAccording to a New York Times article of April 3, 2018, \u201cAt a national Communist Party congress in October 2017, President Xi Jinping made clear the party\u2019s expansive vision of control. \u2018The party exercises overall leadership over all areas of endeavor in every part of the country,\u2019 he told delegates. No corner of society was out of reach. Even books \u2014 \u2018socialist literature,\u2019 in Xi\u2019s words \u2014 must extol \u2018our party, our country, our people and our heroes.\u2019\u201d\n\nThen there was the attempt by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, which triggered the current unrest, to ram through the Legislative Council a new extradition bill earlier this year (since withdrawn) which would make both the citizens of Hong Kong and visitors subject to the long reach of Chinese security forces. The people of Hong Kong decided it was time to either stand up or fatalistically submit to creeping authoritarianism.\n\nAnother unintended consequence of the current unrest in Hong Kong has been to completely derail Xi Jinping\u2019s proposal to use the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula to settle the Taiwan issue. In remarks made at the beginning of 2019, Xi said that unification was the key to \u201cnational rejuvenation,\u201d according to the South China Morning Post. \u201cThe political division across the strait cannot be passed from generation to generation,\u201d he added. Xi proposed the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula for Taiwan. However, the people in Taiwan have been watching very closely the current political struggles of their Hong Kong cousins and, as a result, see \u201cone country, two systems\u201d as the equivalent of the spider inviting the fly into its web.\n\nA further unintended consequence has been placing Hong Kong\u2019s special status in U.S. legislation as a separate customs area with special trading status distinct from China at risk. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, in a report to Congress last year, noted that Beijing\u2019s \u201cencroachment\u201d on the city\u2019s political system could diminish its standing as a global business hub and affect the export of American technology to the city. The report recommended an assessment of the export control policy on technology \u201cas it relates to U.S. treatment of Hong Kong and China as separate customs areas.\u201d", "description": "An unintended consequence of the current unrest in Hong Kong has been to derail Xi Jinping\u2019s proposal to use the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula to settle the Taiwan issue.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/RTS2S0X3%20%281%29.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
