In the Terminal Control Centre at the Kent end, Alison and Tania use binoculars to observe the activities of waiting passengers \u2013 and their animals, including prize-winning dogs returning from Crufts to the Continent.\n\nThe programme reveals the vast equipment required to keep the Channel Tunnel ventilated, and the central service tunnel that is an essential component of the safety systems.\n\nThe first of four episodes does not mention the four fires that have broken out on trucks being carried through the tunnel since it opened. Following a blaze in 2008, in which 14 people were hurt, normal service did not resume for five months.\n\nThe programme begins with a reminder that an Anglo-French initiative to bore a tunnel began in the 1970s. But the \u00a3300m plan was cancelled by the new Labour government in 1975 because of concerns over cost \u2013 which may befall High Speed 2 if the new Conservative government abandons the rail project.\n\nThe Channel Tunnel has failed to meet the expectations made for it \u2013 especially in terms of passenger service, which is largely a tale of abandoned dreams. In 1996, the firm behind Eurostar forecast that it would carry 21.4 million passengers annually by 2004.\n\nEurostar has failed even to reach half that number. The tunnel\u2019s opening coincided with the introduction of open skies in Europe, which led quickly to the launch of easyJet and the rapid expansion of Ryanair. As air fares fell and route options increased, plans for \u201cRegional Eurostar\u201d services connecting the Midlands, north of England and Scotland with Paris were abandoned before a single train had run.\n\nEurostar carries four out of travellers between London and both Brussels and Paris, but cut back services after the EU referendum citing \u201cuncertainty following the vote to leave\u201d.\n\nThe programme makes some surprising claims \u2013 notably that, with an average of eight services an hour each way, the Channel Tunnel is \u201cthe busiest railway system in the world\u201d.\n\nIn fact, compared with some UK rail systems \u2013 such as the West Coast main line between London Euston and Rugby, or the central section of Thameslink through the capital \u2013 the Getlink network is relatively quiet.\n\nThe Channel Tunnel also has the advantage of being a largely closed network; most of the traffic runs between Folkestone and Calais, with an average of just two Eurostar trains per hour each way during the day.\n\nMost services run from London to the French and Belgian capitals. Daily departures to Amsterdam and Rotterdam began in 2018, but direct trains back from the Netherlands are not yet able to run because of bureaucratic issues.\n\nThe Channel Tunnel: Life On The Inside features Tash, a driver who had not been born when the link opened. She explains how the \u201cdead man\u2019s pedal\u201d must be pressed every minute, with drivers given just three seconds to react before the emergency brakes come on.\n\nViewers also get to learn some of the jargon. When a train carrying trucks breaks down, for example, the lorries are \u201cre-circulated\u201d \u2013 an innocuous-sounding term that means they have to drive off the stricken train, make a complete circuit of the tunnel terminal complex and drive on to another train.\n\nWith Brexit looming large in the nation, the BBC programme hears that Getlink has spent more than \u00a310m on new infrastructure that it hopes never to use \u2013 but has had to be built in case of a no-deal departure. John Keefe, spokesperson for the tunnel owner, says: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t take the risk.\u201d", "description": "Twenty-five years ago, Britain was getting closer to Europe \u2013 symbolised on 6 May 1994, when the Queen and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, opened the Channel Tunnel.
