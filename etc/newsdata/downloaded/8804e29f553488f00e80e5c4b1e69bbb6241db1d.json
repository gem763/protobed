I don\u2019t know all the details because he finds it hard to talk about it with me. What I do know is that there are some boys who are bullying him. He\u2019s only been at the school since the beginning of the year and doesn\u2019t have many friends, and now this is making things worse. I try to give him ideas about how to handle difficult situations, but he doesn\u2019t want to listen I want to do something to help but I don\u2019t know what. I hate to see my child looking so sad.\n\nAnswer\n\nBullying in whatever form it comes can cause great damage to the victim. If not handled carefully, the damage can be irreparable. So it\u2019s good that you are trying to get involved and find help for your son \u2013 it will be beneficial for him in the long run.I suggest you inform the school that your son is being bullied. You can even do this anonymously. The school should investigate the matter and will know the proper manner in which to deal with this. Most schools now have life orientation teachers who are trained to handle such matters. It\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019ve made it clear to your son that you\u2019re there for him, but he may benefit from seeing a counsellor because he finds it easier to open up to someone else.\n\nBullyingUK advices parents to teassure your child it\u2019s not their fault. There\u2019s still a stigma attached to bullying and some children feel they\u2019ve brought it upon themselves. Remind them that many celebrities have been bullied too. Being bullied isn't about being weak and being a bully isn't about being strong. \"Encourage your child to try to appear confident - even if they don\u2019t feel it,\" says Sue Atkins, former deputy head and parenting coach.
