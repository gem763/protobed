The sun can provide massive solar power and the wind has been harnessed by humankind for thousands of years, but because both are intermittent and battery technology cannot yet store all we need there is a gap.\n\n\u201cWe believe the answer lies beneath our feet in the heat underground that can be accessed by drilling technology that pumps water towards the centre of the Earth and brings it back up superheated to provide us with heat and electricity.\n\n\u201cThe missing piece of the jigsaw in a 24/7 clean renewable energy future is this baseload. Now we have the green light and the funding to start drilling we are determined to make this technology work.\u201d\n\nAlmost \u00a310m has come from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) while Cornwall council has put in \u00a31.4m and institutional investors have contributed the remaining money.\n\nThe \u00a316.8m will pay for the first phase of the project \u2013 drilling a well, a research programme and a heat main \u2013 to prove the extent of the resource.\n\nThis first well will initially supply a heating system for Eden\u2019s biomes, offices and greenhouses. It is intended to pave the way for the second phase \u2013 another well almost three miles deep and an electricity plant.\n\nCompleting the second phase will mean Eden will be generating sufficient renewable energy to become carbon positive by 2023, and it aims to be able to provide heat and power for the local area.\n\nSmit said: \u201cGeothermal will be a gamechanger for Eden, Cornwall and the UK. Once up and running, our plant will provide more than enough renewable electricity and heat for the whole site, as well as for the local area.\u201d\n\nGuy Macpherson-Grant, managing director of EGS Energy, a geothermal development group that is working with Eden, said: \u201cThe geology in the county is particularly well-suited for cost-efficient heat and power generation, and St Austell benefits from particularly high heat flows.\u201d\n\nGlenn Caplin, chief executive of the Cornwall & Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership, added: \u201cThis is another huge step forward in the drive to create a geothermal industry in Cornwall, using our natural assets to decarbonise our economy and create high value jobs. Renewable energy is both an environmental and an economic opportunity for Cornwall.\u201d", "description": "Cornwall council and EU will fund scheme to tap into \u2018hot rocks\u2019 beneath attraction", "authors": ["Steven Morris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/885d457deb7d086c8f500831548ba96184a55bb2/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5501ad737f0d88d30c003c58cb4e42cd", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
