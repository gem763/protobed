Now, the asking price has dropped to $33.9 million, according to the listing with Gibson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\n\nThe five-bedroom, five-bathroom, two-half-bath mansion was custom-built in 2015. The 12,112-square-foot home was designed by architect Richard Landry, who was dubbed \u201cKing of the Megamansion\u201d by The New York Times.\n\nThe residence sits on more than 5 acres adjacent to a golf course and has its own 2,400-square-foot herb and vegetable garden. It also includes a three-car garage and a circular driveway that can hold up to 20 vehicles.\n\nAll five bedrooms are located upstairs. Downstairs, the home features a recreation room, kids' playroom, wine room, gym and spa.\n\nA separate guest house has a yoga studio, full bathroom, sleeping loft and walls that open to let in fresh air.\n\nNews of the listing sparked concerns among Patriots fans that Brady, who has won six Super Bowls with New England, was planning to retire, especially as his contract extension reportedly expires after the current season.\n\nBut Brady told WEEI radio in August that fans \u201cshouldn\u2019t read into anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it takes a long time to sell a house,\u201d he said. \u201cMy house is a little bit of an expensive one, so it doesn\u2019t fly off the shelf in a couple weeks. I think I\u2019m a point in my life where there\u2019s a lot of considerations that go into playing. I have a very busy professional life, I have a very busy personal life. Any decision that\u2019s made has to consider everything.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nFOX Business' Thomas Barrabi contributed to this report.", "description": "The couple listed their Brookline, Massachusetts, home for $39.5 million in August.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/Tom-Brady-2019-GettyImages-1097201698.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
