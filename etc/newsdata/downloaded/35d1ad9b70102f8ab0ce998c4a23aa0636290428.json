Davis scored 25 points, making 9 of 14 free throws, and James had 18.\n\n\u201cFor us, we\u2019re both aggressive,\u201d Davis said. \u201cSometimes we kind of miss each other. I missed him a couple times and he missed me, so just trying to figure it out.\u201d\n\nDanny Green outscored them both with 28 points, including seven 3-pointers, in the highest-scoring debut by a Laker in franchise history.\n\nLeonard got it done without his personal recruit Paul George, sidelined indefinitely while rehabbing from a pair of offseason shoulder surgeries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the first game of the season, so it\u2019s going to take the season and mistakes and success to get us on the same page,\u201d Leonard said.\n\nWearing a black tuxedo jacket and bow tie, George received a mixed reaction when introduced in the playoff-like atmosphere at Staples Center, where the Clippers were the home team for the first of four meetings in the arena the teams share.\n\n\u201cTheir fans were very loud early and I thought our fans took over from that point on,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cIt\u2019s great for the city.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers\u2019 reserves outscored the Lakers\u2019 bench, 60-19. Last season, Williams and Harrell were the NBA\u2019s highest-scoring reserve duo, and they picked up where they left off.\n\n\u201cThis bench is going to be better this year than even last year,\u201d Rivers said.\n\nIt came down to the fourth quarter, and the Clippers dominated.\n\nTied 85-all, they opened with a 19-7 run to go up 104-92. Five different players scored and Leonard assisted on Maurice Harkless\u2019 3-pointer.\n\nJames had three of the Lakers\u2019 six turnovers in the fourth, when Harkless and Leonard each blocked shots by Dwight Howard.\n\n\u201cThat was just very careless and they capitalized off of it,\u201d James said.\n\nWith 4 \u00bd minutes left, Lakers fans chanted \u201cLet\u2019s go, Lakers! Let\u2019s go, Lakers!\u201d while others hit the exits.\n\n\u201cThe NBA\u2019s back and everyone\u2019s trying to have the narrative of it\u2019s a rivalry game and it\u2019s a huge test,\u201d James said, \u201cbut I think both teams are not where they want to be. We have a lot of room to improve.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers erased a 14-point deficit in the third, led by Danny Green\u2019s 18 points. He capped a 15-0 run with his fifth 3-pointer before JaMychal Green\u2019s 3-pointer pulled the Clippers into an 85-all tie heading into the fourth.\n\nThe Clippers outscored the Lakers 40-29 in the second quarter, buoyed by 16 points from Leonard. He made seven straight shots on a variety of moves \u2014 pullups, fadeaways, a cutting dunk.\n\nThe Lakers raced to a 13-2 lead, their largest of the game. James scored over Leonard and he later heard \u201cMVP! MVP!\u201d chants while sinking his first free throws of the season.\n\nThe Lakers shot 53% from the floor in the first quarter, while the Clippers missed shots and had a basket by Williams taken away when the Lakers challenged a foul call on Howard.\n\nThe rivalry was on early with a male fan shouting \u201cGo Lakers!\u201d during the national anthem, drawing big cheers while Clipper fans booed.\n\n\u201cIt was everything I expected,\u201d Davis said. \u201cVery anticipated game and it was fun.\u201d", "description": "Leonard played his first career game as a Los Angeles Clipper by scoring 30 points over the Lakers.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT865_kawhi_ZG_20191023114753.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
