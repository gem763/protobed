That\u2019s why it was important for me, before our original trip plan, to at least spend one night in Doonbeg.\"\n\nDemocrats criticized the vice president for using taxpayer dollars not just to visit his family but also to stay at Trump International Golf Club in Doonbeg. \"You took an oath to the Constitution, not to @realDonaldTrump,\" Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., tweeted. \"Funneling taxpayer money to @POTUS by staying at this Trump resort is sooooooo corrupt.\"\n\n\"Your tax dollars: making the Trump family richer,\" the Democratic National Committee said in a tweet directed at Pence and the president, who visited his golf club in Virginia twice over the Labor Day weekend.\n\nJacob King/AP\n\nWhile Pence had originally been slated to spend one night there, his chief of staff said last-minute changes to his trip -- including the addition of a stop in Poland, after the president sent him there in his stead -- resulted in the vice president staying in Doonbeg Monday night, flying to Dublin for the day on Tuesday for meetings with Ireland's prime minister and president, and returning to the village for a second night.\n\nAsked on Tuesday if the president asked Pence to stay at his property, the vice president's chief of staff, Marc Short, told reporters that he did not think it was \"a request, like a command\" -- but rather \"a suggestion.\"\n\n\"It's like when we went through the trip, it's like, well, he's going to Doonbeg because that's where the Pence family is from,\" Short said Tuesday. \"It's like, 'Well, you should stay at my place.'\"\n\nLorraine OSullivan/Reuters\n\nEarly Wednesday, though, the vice president's office followed up with a statement from a spokesperson who said \"the decision to stay at\" the resort \"was solely a decision by the Office of the Vice President and was based on the requirement to find accommodations near the Vice President\u2019s ancestral hometown that could satisfy official meetings on both coasts of the Emerald Isle.\"\n\n\"At no time did the President direct our office to stay at his Doonbeg resort,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nPence called it an \"opportunity\" to spend the night there, arguing that it was \u201clogical\u201d because Doonbeg is \u201ca fairly small place\u201d and the Trump golf club could \u201caccommodate the unique footprint that comes with our security detail and other personnel.\u201d\n\nBut the fact that Pence was traveling to Doonbeg at all has raised eyebrows The village is about 140 miles from Dublin. He has flown back and forth from Shannon, Ireland, about an hour's drive away.\n\nPaul Faith/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\n\"As a general matter, absent security or other serious logistical concerns, government officials stay overnight in hotels near the location of planned meetings,\" John Cohen, a former homeland security department official who traveled with cabinet-level officials internationally, said. Cohen is an ABC News contributor.\n\nShort said Tuesday an estimate of the cost to taxpayers for the stop would be provided at a later point. He said Pence was \"personally paying\" for his sister and mother's expenses, according to a reporter traveling with the vice president.\n\nPence visited Ireland after replacing Trump in Poland for ceremonies commemorating the start of World War II, and on Wednesday he planned to continue onward to Iceland.\n\nOn Tuesday evening in Doonbeg, Pence and his family visited Morrissey\u2019s Pub \u2013 where he worked briefly pouring pints in 1981 and which his distant cousin owns. He gestured at a nearby house where he said his great grandmother used to live, according to a reporter traveling with him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a wonderful dinner,\u201d Pence said before entering the bar.\n\nReporters and news cameras weren't allowed inside.", "description": "Vice President Mike Pence stayed in a small village where his cousin owns a bar -- and where President Donald Trump owns a golf club.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/pence-ireland-family-rt-jt-190903_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
