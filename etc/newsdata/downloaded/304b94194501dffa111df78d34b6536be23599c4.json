We\u2019ve got good news for you as Volkswagen has dropped three presentation videos with the Golf 8, finished in a striking Lime Yellow paint. Powered by a mild-hybrid eTSI petrol engine, the compact hatchback was built in the high-end Style trim level, therefore it pretty much has all the bells and whistles. As a reminder, Style will replace the previous Highline with the Mk8.\n\nCan't get enough of the Golf 8?\n\nThe new Golf in Style flavour comes generously equipped as standard with goodies like 17-inch alloy wheels (although this one seems to have a larger 18-inch set) and additional chrome detailing on the outside, including for the faux trapezoidal exhaust tips. Front sport seats are also part of the deal, as are LED headlights with cornering function and LED taillights with sequential turn signals, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear knob, LED ambient lighting in 32 different colours, and electric mirrors with memory function.\n\nGo for the Style trim and VW will be more than happy to throw in the first three-zone climate control system installed in a Golf. It\u2019s called Air Care Climatronic and has a feature called Smart Climate offering functions such as \u201cwarm hands\u201d or \u201cfresh air.\u201d This version also has an electrically adjustable driver\u2019s seat, the lane-keeping system, and the semi-autonomous driving system dubbed Travel Assist.\n\nAs with all versions of the new Golf, it gets a fully digital instrument cluster measuring 10.25 inches, and it\u2019s joined in this car by the larger of the two infotainment systems, measuring 10 inches. The optional 400-watt Harman Kardon sound system also makes a brief appearance on camera and it promises to deliver \u201cperfect sound\u201d as per VW\u2019s statement.\n\nThe Golf 8 goes on sale in Europe this December with plans to bring performance versions in 2020. Pricing and a launch date for the United Kingdom aren't yet available.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Same shape and size, yet still different enough to separate it from the Mk7.", "authors": ["Feedback", "Adrian Padeanu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cyi6etzVroDJ4ZALGb.a0w--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/motor1_uk_340/768e6ed9a44c99bf2db8a87b602c4e2b", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
