Clarida Says Economy in Good Place, Fed to Talk Balance Sheet\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy is on solid footing said Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, supported by Americans spending even as global manufacturing is in a slump.\n\n\u201cThe economy is in a good place,\u201d Clarida said at a forum on Thursday hosted by The Wall Street Journal in New York. \u201cThe consumer is in good shape, inflation is stable.\u201d\n\nThe comments came as a slew of weak reports this week signaled that the U.S. economy is slowing, threatening the longest expansion on record. An index of service sector activity -- a critical indicator because the industries tend to be consumer based and somewhat insulated from global trade conflicts -- stumbled to a three-year low in September. A separate report on factory activity fell to a 10-year low.\n\nWhen asked if the chance of a recession was higher than normal, Clarida said, \"I don\u2019t think recession risks are particularly elevated under appropriate monetary policy.\"\n\nClarida spoke without a prepared text and was answering questions from a Wall Street Journal reporter and the audience. He said the U.S. central bank will discuss the appropriate size of its balance sheet at its October meeting following a recent spike in overnight lending rates.\n\n\u201cWe indicated in July that at some point after a time that we\u2019d begin to grow our balance sheet again and Chair Powell indicated that is a topic we will be discussed in our October meeting,\u201d Clarida said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll have something for you after our October meeting on that.\u201d\n\nPressed further on the health of the consumer, the Fed vice chairman pointed to \u201csolid\u201d income growth, a low unemployment rate, and a household savings rate of 8.1%.\n\n\u201cHouseholds compared to prior decades have a cushion,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. central bankers pivoted away from their rate-hike plans in January and have cut borrowing costs twice this year, in an effort to shield the economy from a global slump in manufacturing brought about by trade disputes and a restructuring of some sectors such as autos. Clarida said he was \u201chappy\u201d about the policy turn earlier this year.\n\nRepo Talks\n\nMoney market financing costs soared recently in the wake of tax payments and Treasury debt finance operations. The incident sparked concern that bank liquidity is running too tight. The New York Fed has had to conduct a series of overnight and term repo operations to pump money into the financial system temporarily. Clarida indicated that the topic will be on the table when officials meet later this month.\n\n\u201cWe also discussed in our June meeting the possibility of at some point putting in a repo facility to help us keep the federal funds rate in the range and we will certainly be discussing and addressing that at future meetings as well,\u201d he said.\n\nInflation continues to undershoot the central bank\u2019s 2% target. The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 1.4% for the 12-month period ending August, while the core measure rose 1.8%.\n\nThe Labor Department will publish the September jobs report Friday, and analysts will be watching to see if private sector payroll growth continues to decelerate.\n\nThe rash of bad economic news has prompted traders to price about an 85% probability of a cut when the Federal Open Market Committee next meets October 29-30.", "description": "Clarida Says Economy in Good Place, Fed to Talk Balance Sheet", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE3F1G6_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
