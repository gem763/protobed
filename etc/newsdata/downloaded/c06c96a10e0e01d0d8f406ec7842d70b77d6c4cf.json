Among the bad news, Turkey and Syria; China GDP growth the slowest since 1990s; retail sales fell; BA, JNJ, IBM [DJIA components] slumped on company-specific issues. Dollar fell \u2013 if that continues, it will benefit the US multinationals, cyclicals [and commodities, EMs].\n\nLagging healthcare stocks [fwd P/E 15.1] rebounded on good earnings [UNH], potential opioid settlements [TEVA], and poor showing for Medicare-for-all in the last Democratic debate [benefitting managed-healthcare stocks (CI)]. Biotech remains a high risk-reward segment.\n\nEmerson Electric [EMR] is attractive. Activist D.E. Shaw is pushing for better governance and possibly splitting the company into two \u2013 climate control and automation equipment; some think that Shaw\u2019s goals are two optimistic for cyclical businesses.\n\n[The CME FedWatch tool, based on current fed fund futures quotes, shows the following probabilities for 2019:\n\nFor 3rd hike [cut],\n\n0% for hike [91.4% for cut] at FOMC 10/30/19;\n\n0% for hike [93.7% for cut] at FOMC 12/11/19;\n\nhttp://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html ]\n\nFor the week [index changes only], DJIA -0.17%, SP500 +0.54%, Nasdaq Comp +0.40%, Russell 2000 +1.56%.

Inflation is +15%; GDP growth is only +1%; banking sector is shaky; budget deficit is 5% of GDP; central banker was recently replaced with a government-friendly person; chronic current-account deficit; huge foreign borrowing. Recent excursion into NE Syria has made things worse \u2013 TUR fell -10% since Oct 7; 10-yr yield jumped to 15.5%; some US sanctions already and more coming. Don\u2019t bottom-fish. Better EMs are Mexico, Brazil, India.\n\nPg M9, Commodities: From 1/1/20, the new shipping rule for low-sulfur marine fuel, IMO 2020, will raise shipping costs, and the price for heating fuel may go up by +20% to +30%. This may translate into +5% to +10% higher prices of some retail goods. Inventories of refined petroleum products [distillates] are already 11% below 5-yr average. Oil-fired power plants can continue to use high-sulfur fuel.\n\nPg M7, Options: Ahead of earnings on Oct 24, AMZN calls are attractive; investors with deep-pockets may also sell puts.\n\n[SP500 VIX 14.25, SKEW 126.24] [10-Yr TYVIX 5.32] [Yahoo Finance data]\n\nPg M23, M28: An up week in Europe [Sweden +2.37%, Switzerland -0.97%] and a good week in Asia [India +3.58%, Singapore -0.20%].

President Trump also likes weaker dollar. A beneficiary of weak dollar will be gold. Many central banks are buying gold for reserve diversification. Consider a small allocation to gold.\n\nDemocratic candidates Warren and Sanders have proposed graduated wealth tax to fund ambitious social programs. In recent years, France, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Austria have repealed wealth tax because they weren\u2019t effective; Switzerland, Norway, Spain still have modest levels of wealth tax.
