Pressure has grown on Silva, who is firmly the bookmakers favourite to be the next manager to be sacked, with Everton dropping into the Premier League\u2019s bottom three following four successive defeats.\n\nIt means the 42-year-old\u2019s position is under serious scrutiny by Everton\u2019s hierarchy but it seems he will continue as manager \u2013 for now \u2013 with the home league game against West Ham United on Saturday October 19 appearing crucial.\n\nSilva has himself labelled the fixture a \u201cmust-win\u201d after collecting just seven points in the opening eight league games which have included defeats to newly-promoted Aston Villa and Sheffield United and last Saturday\u2019s loss to Burnley.\n\nEverton have only played one team from last season\u2019s top six \u2013 losing at home to Manchester City albeit with an improved performance two weekends ago.\n\nWith Newcastle beating Manchester United it means Everton have slipped into the relegation places ahead of the international break which is bad timing for Silva.", "description": "Marco Silva will remain in charge of Everton after the international break.", "authors": ["Jason Burt", "Chief Football Correspondent", "Jim White", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212114323-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq_MBhvjUqhIfRd2_dxg_gJ6V3fd9IImn380TW3VFr46A.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
