You're absolutely huge\".\n\n'I had already said we were not going to have sex. You end up getting to know someone over a cup of tea and I invited him in to be sociable.\n\n'I thought he was going to have a cup of tea and chat.'\n\nPrior to Schubert's arrival, the woman told police, they had discussed sleeping in the same bed if he came over to her house but she had said nothing would happen and that she would wear her pyjamas.\n\nThe woman told police she invited Schubert, pictured, in just for a cup of tea after he arrived at her doorstep looking very dissimilar from - and much larger than - his dating profiles pictures\n\nThe woman added: 'Given his size, we would not have fitted comfortably in the same bed.\n\n'There is personal space and there is personal space. Even if I had a king size bed...I'd have no personal space at all. I'd have nowhere to go.\n\n'There had already been a conversation. He had invited me over to his and he had a king size bed.\n\n'I said to him that if I felt comfortable I'd sleep in a king size bed, but I'd have my personal space.\n\n'When he arrived and I saw his size I just thought: \"There is absolutely no way\".\n\n'I said I did not know he was as big as what he was. Literally.\n\n'It doesn't stop me liking someone because of his size but it was never my intention to sleep with him.'\n\nToday Schubert, of St Neots, Cambs, denied two counts of rape and two counts of sexual assault by penetration.\n\nHe sat wearing a dark blazer and t-shirt as he listened to the chat history between him and the complainant being read out before the jury and Judge Nigel Daly.\n\nHe had told his alleged victim how he earned a living selling 'designer clothes, shoes, anything I can get my hands on' over online auctioneering marketplace, eBay.\n\nDuring police interview, jurors were told, Schubert claimed the sex was consensual.\n\nOxford Crown Court heard that the ordeal caused 'excruciating' pain for the woman and that the sex was not consensual.\n\nCharles Ward-Jackson, prosecuting, said: 'This is a case about a woman who was raped and sexually assaulted in her own home.\n\n'By a man she had just met on an internet dating site, that man being Schubert.'\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Christopher Schubert, 44, met his alleged victim in January 2018 on Match.com.
