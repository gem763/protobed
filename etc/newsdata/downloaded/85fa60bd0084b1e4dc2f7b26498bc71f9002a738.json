You might be thinking, luxury \u2013 sustainability \u2013 can the two ever go hand in hand? Although you may deem them antithetical concepts, there is plenty of evidence that the luxury market is becoming more ethical, given they have the time and money to invest in materials and ingredients that will last. Luxury brands set an example further down the retail chain and therefore should be championing sustainability at their core, bringing us excellent products from trustworthy sources.\n\nIn the last few years, there have been positive efforts within the sustainability movement to \u201credefine luxury as something that embodies the social and environmental credentials of a product or service,\u201d The Guardian reported back in 2011. In just the last year, we have seen luxury fashion titan LVMH sign a deal with UNESCO to put traceability and transparency at the helm of their brands, Kering partner with French President Macron in a similar vein and labels like Ralph Lauren and Chanel commit to environmentally conscious initiatives.\n\nThis week is Positive Luxury week in London and you can get involved by attending an event on the \u2018positive trail\u2019 somewhere in the capital to learn more. All the brands that are featured have been accredited with the Butterfly Mark, a symbol of trust earned solely by companies who put sustainability at the forefront of their business strategy.\n\nHere\u2019s the full schedule of what you can expect:\n\nSara Griffiths - Founder of the Universal Soul Company in Conversation with Skincare & Fashion brands\n\n17th October 2019, 6.00 - 8.00pm.
