How Victorians trumped Donald with fake news", "language": "en", "text": "Fake News: A True Story\n\nRating:\n\nMotherland\n\nRating:\n\nLord preserve us from the sight of Ian Hislop dancing to jazz music. Pirouetting and high-kicking, the Private Eye editor looked like Mr Toad in a leotard.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t really him, of course. And it wasn\u2019t a lookalike. Face-mapping software wielded by a hacker with a punk mohican had superimposed Hislop\u2019s saggy features onto the head of a professional dancer, in Fake News: A True Story (BBC4).\n\nFans of The Capture, the BBC1 high-tech surveillance thriller that concludes tonight, will know all about it.\n\nLord preserve us from the sight of Ian Hislop (pictured) dancing to jazz music. Pirouetting and high-kicking, the Private Eye editor looked like Mr Toad in a leotard\n\nThis is the so-called \u2018deep fake\u2019 video-editing tool, used by fiendish spymasters to manipulate CCTV footage. Hislop should count himself lucky he was seen apparently doing nothing worse than the splits.\n\nBest-known as a team captain on the long-running Have I Got News For You, Hislop was making a one-off foray into a subject whose history he clearly knew well.\n\nThe sections on how Victorian news-paper editors competed to outsell their rivals by inventing outlandish stories were fascinating.\n\nAn 1835 series in New York\u2019s Sun newspaper, announcing that high-powered telescopes had found life on the Moon, was not so much fake news as fabulous pioneering science fiction.\n\nHislop covered modern-day hoaxes in a droning interview with former BBC director-general Mark Thompson (pictured)\n\nDecades before Jules Verne and Edgar Rice Burroughs imagined alien worlds, the Sun\u2019s wizards invented a race of bat-winged humans who hunted unicorns and appeared to mate in mid-air. It was lurid stuff.\n\nFor 40 minutes the documentary kept up a brisk pace, from spiritualist scams to World War I propaganda about German atrocities that had an unforeseen effect 25 years later: it made people in Britain who remembered the lies less likely to believe the true stories during World War II about Nazi death camps.\n\nBut Hislop flagged when he came to modern-day hoaxes. For a man who makes his living in various ways from current affairs, he seemed bored by allegations of fake news tearing U.S. politics apart.\n\nHe covered it in a droning interview with former BBC director-general Mark Thompson, now boss of the New York Times, which was one of the dullest monologues I\u2019ve heard in a while.\n\nHislop briefly mentioned Private Eye\u2019s brushes with fake news, but he was referring to misunderstandings where dimwitted members of the public failed to realise they were reading jokes, not facts.\n\nThe fake news in Motherland (BBC2) was that the new mum at the school gates, Meg (Tanya Moodie), was a superwoman. Pictured, Anne (Philippa Dunne), Amanda (Lucy Punch), Julia (Anna Maxwell Martin), Liz (Diane Morgan), Kevin (Paul Ready) and Meg (Tanya Moodie)\n\nSome years ago, the Eye ran a cover photo of the Queen inscribing her name in a gilded book, with the headline \u2018Millions sign petition to stop Trump state visit\u2019. Private Eye is now on a \u2018fake news\u2019 online blacklist. Talk about a sense of humour failure.\n\nThe fake news in Motherland (BBC2) was that the new mum at the school gates, Meg (Tanya Moodie), was a superwoman.\n\nApparently an international business consultant, she struck deals in multiple languages on her mobile while raising five well-adjusted children and enjoying a blissful marriage.\n\nNaturally, Julia (Anna Maxwell Martin) loathed her. \u2018Where\u2019s your secret sadness?\u2019 she fumed. But this is Motherland, where parenthood is the seventh circle of hell and every day when you haven\u2019t strangled one of your little darlings can be counted as a success.\n\nNo surprises, then, when Meg turned out to be a raging alcoholic who regarded hijacking a bus and confrontations with the police as ordinary hazards of a good binge.\n\nEven if this comedy is a trifle cynical and earthy for some tastes, it\u2019s always worth it for the deadpan world-weariness of Liz (Diane Morgan) \u2014 who reckons the chief compensation for being a single mother is getting ten per cent off at Dorothy Perkins.\n\nMASTERPIECE OF THE WEEK:\n\nA retired detective told me he rarely watches crime dramas because they get so much wrong. But he was glued to A Confession (ITV), about the flawed hunt for killer taxi-driver Christopher Halliwell. \u2018It\u2019s bang on,\u2019 he said.", "description": "CHRISTOPHER STEVENS: Face-mapping software had superimposed Ian Hislop's saggy features onto the head of a professional dancer, in Fake News: A True Story (BBC4).", "authors": ["Christopher Stevens For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/01/19420954-0-image-a-5_1570495677998.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
