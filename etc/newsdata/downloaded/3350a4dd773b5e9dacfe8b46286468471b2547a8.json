Remarkably, among the charred remains of what had been their house, Amy Lamon, 46, found her wedding ring. \u201cEverything was tipped over, and it was just standing there,\u201d she said, holding a jewelry box that somehow been untouched by the flames.\n\nIn addition to fighting the flames, firefighters pulled family pictures off the walls and hauled them and other mementos in recycling bins outside the Lamon\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cIn this room, nothing made it,\u201d said David Lamon, 48. \u201cThat\u2019s our foundation, the concrete. So it burned down, burned our whole floor and everything.\u201d\n\nThe fire started last Thursday and picked up force Friday. Firefighters say it\u2019s now about 80 percent contained but not before it burned down 24 houses and damaged 40 more. But the Tick Fire is just one of ten active wildfires burning in California. And Tuesday\u2019s high winds are expected to make them worse could make them worse.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued \u201cred flag\u201d warnings across the state, and Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency on Sunday. In northern California, the Kincade Fire has torched nearly 75,000 acres and destroyed more than 100 buildings.\n\nMore than 10,000 buildings, including houses, are inside the evacuation zone around the Getty Fire in the Los Angeles area.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, PG&E, the state\u2019s largest electrical utility company announced another round of power shutoffs, which could affect as many as 2 million people. And dealing with fire in the dark makes things that much more difficult.\n\n\u201cIf we had electricity, things would have been different,\u201d David Lamon said. \u201cWhen you shut off our power, you shut off our water. And when you shut off our water, you shut off our ability to protect our homes and to protect ourselves.\u201d\n\nCover: David and Amy Lamon return to their home destroyed by the Tick Fire in Santa Clarita, Calif.
