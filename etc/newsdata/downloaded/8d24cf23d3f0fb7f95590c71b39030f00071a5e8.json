Read more opinion articles at CNN.\n\n(CNN) Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old Swedish activist, just reminded us all what exactly is at stake with the crisis of climate change.\n\nWhen I returned to the White House to serve as President Barack Obama's communications director, one of the first conversations we had was about how he wanted to spend time in his final two years elevating the issue of climate change.\n\nJen Psaki\n\nAnd we tried to do exactly that.\n\nWe went to national parks and he talked about clean air and water, went to the everglades to talk about the impact on tourism.
