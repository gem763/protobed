This means that you should be able to play even graphically intensive games on laptops, tablets, or smart phones, and pick up your game right where you left off on any of those pieces of hardware. But, at least at launch, you need to buy the official hardware to use Stadia.\n\nRelated Google Stadia is the new streaming gaming platform from Google\n\nThe ability to play Stadia games without Google\u2019s official hardware is coming ... at some point in the future. There\u2019s no specific date announced yet, beyond \u201csometime in 2020.\u201d\n\nThe wireless controller that Google is shipping with these initial consoles, for the service that doesn\u2019t require a console, will only work wirelessly on the Chromecast Ultra. If you want to use it on any other device, you\u2019ll need a USB-C cable until wireless capability is added for more devices.\n\nHow much do we trust Google?\n\nThis is as early access as a hardware launch can get, with key features that are supposed to be the entire point of the platform completely absent at launch, and squishy timelines for when they\u2019ll be added. This is a service with no console, that requires a console. This is a controller that can be used on a variety of devices, at some point, that only works wirelessly on one device for now.\n\nGoogle is reportedly going to decrease latency in the future by rolling out a feature that predicts what button you will press, before you press it. That technology might solve most of Stadia\u2019s problems, if it\u2019s ever perfected or released.\n\nThe ability to play Stadia games without Google\u2019s official hardware is coming ... at some point in the future\n\nI don\u2019t know who the people are who are pre-ordering a system that will launch without being able to do nearly anything it\u2019s been designed to do, in order to buy games you can get on other platforms or may already own, to play anywhere as long as you\u2019re near the hardware and don\u2019t mind plugging the wireless controller into existing devices, but I\u2019m nowhere near confident enough in the technology or Google\u2019s track record with cancelling products and services to join them.\n\nHeck, I\u2019m worried about that even with Google product launches I really enjoyed. I was a big fan of Daydream VR, in fact. It launched in 2016, and showed how well Google can enter into new markets. It was also recently discontinued, although the app itself will still be supported.\n\nYou can consider Stadia to be kind of like putting regular gaming hardware on a payment plan, except the monthly $9.99 payments never end if you want to play games in 4K, and you may lose everything you have bought if Google ever decides to cancel the service. Google assures you that won\u2019t happen, outside of \u201cunforseen circumstances,\u201d but those circumstances leave a lot of room for Google to allow that to happen without breaking its promise.\n\nStadia could be great, and many very large companies are investing very large sums of money into making game streaming a reality so they can control every aspect of how games are released, played, and shared. Whoever gets there first may very well have a monstrous advantage in the marketplace, and only powerful companies with massive warchests and existing infrastructures are going to be able to even try.\n\nI understand why Google is trying this, but what I don\u2019t understand is why anyone would take them at their word when so little is ready for players. I\u2019m fine with early access games these days, but an early access console should at least be able to do the most basic things that make that console stand out among the competition.", "description": "Google Stadia is launching in less than a month, but the service will require specific hardware at first, and key features are missing until some time in 2020.
