The door to the gallery was open, and Hopkins had his back turned.\n\n\"Snatch and run,\" Hopkins tells NPR.\n\nIt took just a few minutes to realize the etching was gone. For some reason, the work hadn't been locked with a tether as it normally was.\n\nHopkins never did see the thief, though surveillance footage from the hotel next door appears to show a young man in a flat-brim cap holding the work casually in one hand as he walks down Geary Street in the Union Square neighborhood. \"Never saw him before in my life,\" Hopkins said.\n\nThe hand-colored etching is called Burning Giraffe (1966), and it's from a series in which the famous surrealist riffed on works by Pablo Picasso. In the Picasso series, the Spanish painter depicts all the stages of a bullfight.\n\nDali's works share some visual similarities \u2013 but with his signature cheekiness.\n\n\"There was no giraffe in the original Picasso,\" Hopkins said. \"And the spectators are now bulls instead of people.\"\n\n\"Some people say there's a lot of erotic symbolism in it,\" added Hopkins, who is himself a painter. \"I think that's a bit of a stretch, but it's a very interesting image.\"\n\nHopkins says that of Dal\u00ed's etchings, Burning Giraffe was the most important. It's numbered, one of a series of 100 made on the same kind of paper.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AFP/Getty Images AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"It's partly teasing Picasso, and partly making full of bullfighting. It's both.\"\n\nThe gallery filed a report with authorities, who had one piece of advice. \"The main thing the police said is we really should have our door closed all the time,\" he said.\n\nAnyone with information on the work is encouraged to reach out to San Francisco Police.\n\n\"If we could get it back, that would be a miracle,\" Hopkins said. \"I've been getting calls, people saying 'If you ever get it back, I want to buy it!'\"", "description": "Surveillance footage shows a young man casually walking away with the $20,000 work, one in a series that's seen as poking fun at both Pablo Picasso and the Spanish tradition of bullfighting.", "authors": ["Laurel Wamsley"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/15/giraffe_wide-24adc584895c80fed3a6d474c22e14ffd7a6bcdc.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
