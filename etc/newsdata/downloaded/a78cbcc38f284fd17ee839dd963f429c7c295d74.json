The You, Me, and Dupree star just turned 75 while his leading lady is just 50 years old.\n\nWhile on The Ellen DeGeneres Show recently, the star opened up about what it's like having a younger wife saying: 'I'm moving right along. I had a cancer about eight or nine years ago where I sort of thought about that stuff.'\n\nOpening up: While on The Ellen DeGeneres Show recently, Michael Douglas opened up about what it's like having a younger wife saying: 'I'm moving right along. I had a cancer about eight or nine years ago where I sort of thought about that stuff.'\n\n'But once I got a clean bill of health after that, it was kind of straight on, feeling good. Having a younger bride makes me feel good on one side,' he said about the Mask of Zorro actress.\n\n'And I got the old man [Kirk Douglas] on the other side with still a full head of hair. So it's all good, you know, you can't be an idiot about it,' he said of his father who is 102.\n\n'So 75, I look at the 15-year program, if I still got my marbles by the time I'm 90. After that, it's all golden.'\n\nLooking good: Catherine shared this photo of her and her man back in June saying: 'From 1998 until forever'\n\nThe two got married back in 2000 after being introduced by their famous friend, Danny DeVito.\n\nThey both share their two children, Dylan, 19, and Carys, 16. He also has another son named Cameron, 40, from his previous marriage to Diandra Luker.\n\nWhile it all may seem like roses and sunshine, the happy couple did take a break and split up back in 2013 but later reconciled after his cancer scare.\n\nBack then: A young Michael and Catherine cheese while posing for a photo\n\nBack in July of 2001 Catherine opened up to Larry King about her then just one-year marriage saying: 'When my mother was telling me about men and telling me the facts of life, she never actually put an age bracket on it.'\n\n'And it's so funny, because Michael and my parents are the same age. So they \u2014 my parents \u2014 when they see us together, never even question that there was a 25-year age difference.'\n\nThe two got married back in November 18, 2000 and will celebrate their 19th wedding anniversary this year.", "description": "Michael Douglas and\u00a0Catherine Zeta-Jones have been married for almost 20 years.
