Addressing the Heritage Foundation, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo said \u201cthere is no climate catastrophe\u201d and described efforts to fight climate change as a plot to destroy national sovereignty.\n\nBrazil is doubling down on its efforts to convince the world the Amazon is in safe hands, despite soaring deforestation and a huge spike in seasonal fires that provoked an international crisis. Bolsonaro is due to address the UN general assembly on 24 September.\n\n\u201cThis is a government that makes efforts to deny the problems, not to face them,\u201d said Marcio Astrini, director of public policy at Greenpeace Brasil.\n\nA spokesman for Salles said he could not confirm nor deny the meeting and a spokeswoman for the Competitive Enterprise Institute did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe CEI\u2019s director for energy and environment, Myron Ebell, led Donald Trump\u2019s transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency. His biography quotes Business Insider, which said: \u201cMyron Ebell may be enemy #1 to the current climate change community.\u201d\n\n\u201cClimate change does not endanger the survival of civilization or the habitability of the planet. So-called climate solutions are bureaucratic power grabs and corporate welfare schemes with no detectable climate-related benefits,\u201d read a June article on the CEI site.\n\nBefore Salles took office in December, a S\u00e3o Paulo judge found he had altered plans for an environmentally protected area in order to favour businesses while state environment secretary. Salles denied the accusations and is appealing against the ruling.\n\nIn July he said that Brazil was not far from \u201czero illegal deforestation\u201d. Satellite date from Brazil\u2019s Space Research Institute calculated a 278% increase in deforestation in July. The institute\u2019s director was fired after President Bolsonaro described the data as \u201clies\u201d. Its data showed more than 30,000 fires in the Amazon in August, the highest since 2010.\n\nIn a recent interview with the far-right Canadian YouTuber Stefan Molyneux, Salles hailed Brazil\u2019s conservation record.\n\nThe minister argued that a primary cause of deforestation was the lack of proper documentation for Amazon land, despite widespread evidence that much degradation takes place in protected areas and indigenous reserves and has been partly fuelled by Bolsonaro\u2019s attacks on environment agencies and protection.", "description": "Ricardo Salles to meet Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) as critics say Bolsonaro lacks commitment to fight climate crisis", "authors": ["Dom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49ed1b1b95a273639d6b530c36a846a6140634fa/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=991fc9750717250f10e1b6702f379ff9", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
