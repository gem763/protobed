They have owned it since 2001, according to public records, but it was not clear how much they paid for it. The couple announced their divorce in 2014 after 19 years of marriage, according to reports.\n\n\n\nNow being represented by Adam Modlin of the Modlin Group, the co-op is being offered with a significant price cut.\n\n\n\nIt was first listed for $39 million in March 2016, according to records. It was removed later that year, only to reappear with another brokerage for just under $29 million in May 2017. The listing was removed later that year.\n\nMore: Naples, Florida, House on a Double Lot Heads to Auction Without Reserve\n\nLocated on the eighth floor, the residence stretches 160 feet along Central Park, according to the listing. That means there are views from its corner living room and formal dining room, as well as the master suite and other bedrooms.\n\n\n\nThe master suite boasts a sitting room, dressing room and two bathrooms, both with soaking tubs and windows on the park, the listing said. The secondary bedrooms also have walk-in closets and dressing rooms.\n\n\n\nOther features include 11-foot ceilings, an eat-in kitchen and a study/library. In addition to the main floor plan, there are several ancillary spaces across the hall that could house a gym, wine storage and art studio, according to the Modlin Group.\n\n\n\nMs. Rosenthal and Mr. Hatkoff founded the Tribeca Film Festival with actor Robert De Niro in 2002 to spur activity in downtown Manhattan after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta Future Returns: Investing in the \u2018Food Revolution\n\nThe Dakota, built in 1884, has attracted some of New York\u2019s most famous faces over the years, including John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Actress Lauren Bacall, singer Roberta Flack and socialite Jacqueline Bikoff were all once residents. Lennon was murdered in front of the building in 1980; Ms. Ono still lives there.\n\n\n\n,\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["V.L.
