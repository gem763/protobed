Trump, October 3:\n\n\u201cI read Mitch McConnell\u2019s statement yesterday, and he read my phone call. And, as you know, he put out a statement that said that was the most innocent phone call he\u2019s read. And I spoke to him about it, too,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time. \u201cHe read my phone call with the president of Ukraine. Mitch McConnell, he said, \u2018That was the most innocent phone call that I\u2019ve read.\u2019 I mean, give me a break.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that McConnell put out a statement last month defending what Trump said to Ukraine\u2019s president during their July phone call. \u201cI\u2019ve read the summary of the call. If this is the \u2018launching point\u2019 for House Democrats\u2019 impeachment process, they\u2019ve already overplayed their hand. It\u2019s clear there is no quid pro quo that the Democrats were desperately praying for,\u201d his office said to Politico. When he was asked about his alleged phone call with Trump today, it would have been the easiest thing for him to agree that they also spoke about it \u2014 or, if he was unwilling to fib on that point, to at least reiterate that he agrees with Trump that the call was perfectly innocent even if he can\u2019t recall speaking directly to him about it.\n\nInstead, this. Hoo boy:\n\nMaybe that Bill Taylor testimony earlier today has Cocaine Mitch worried that this is going to get worse and it\u2019s time to start quarantining the caucus from the president as best he can. This wasn\u2019t the only time he declined to defend Trump today, either. While most Senate Republicans spent the day dutifully spinning for him for comparing the impeachment process to a \u201clynching,\u201d McConnell was not so inclined:\n\nProof enough that Mitch has a case of Trump fatigue and it\u2019s worsening? No? Well, then, go read his WaPo op-ed from a few days ago titled, \u201cWithdrawing from Syria is a grave mistake.\u201d He was careful not to use the word \u201cTrump\u201d in the piece but his argument went right at the president \u2014 and at Trumpist foreign policy generally:\n\nIf we Americans care at all about the post-World War II international system that has sustained an unprecedented era of peace, prosperity and technological development, we must recognize that we are its indispensable nation. We built this system, we sustained it, and we have benefited from it most of all. When the United States threw off the comforting blanket of isolationism in the 1940s and took the mantle of global leadership, we made the whole world better, but we specifically made it much better for the United States. If we abandon that mantle today, we can be sure that a new world order will be made \u2014 and not on terms favorable to us\u2026 As we seek to pick up the pieces, we must remain guided by our national interests and not emotions. While Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s offensive into northeastern Syria is misguided, is it really the case that the United States would prefer that Russian, Syrian and Iranian forces control the region rather than Turkey, our NATO ally?\n\nWhether or not the United States would prefer that Russia control the region or not, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening: The deal reached today between Putin and Erdogan calls for joint Russian/Turkish patrols of the border area to \u201cremove\u201d Kurdish troops, with help from Assad\u2019s forces. McConnell has all sorts of ways he could have communicated his unhappiness about Syria to Trump \u2014 privately, of course, through leaks to the media, or by deputizing lieutenants within the caucus to make media appearances politely criticizing the decision. He certainly didn\u2019t need to offer the Washington Post an op-ed under his own name.\n\nSo what are we to make of the fact that he did? Or the fact that he continues to apply pressure to Trump on Syria, tweeting this earlier this afternoon?\n\nI am introducing a Senate resolution to reaffirm the need for a strong U.S. presence and oppose premature withdrawal from Syria or Afghanistan. I hope my colleagues on both sides will take the opportunity to affirm these principles on the record. \u2014 Leader McConnell (@senatemajldr) October 22, 2019\n\nI continue to believe there\u2019s near-zero chance of Trump being removed by the Senate or of McConnell recommending to his caucus that the president be removed. But, with Trump\u2019s agenda dead in Congress thanks to Pelosi and with McConnell staring at five more years potentially of managing the daily multiple Trump crises, I think he may have reached the point where he\u2019s concluded it\u2019s time for a little more \u201cseparation\u201d between the president and the Senate. He can read the impeachment polls as well as anyone else can. The right\u2019s not going to turn on POTUS but there\u2019s enough of a chance of a general public backlash that the Senate could flip \u2014 Collins, Gardner, McSally, Ernst, the two Georgia seats all could go blue in a worst-case scenario. McConnell\u2019s thinking ahead, knowing that GOP control of the Senate may be the only obstacle to President Warren enacting her policy wishlist in 2021. If Trump\u2019s going down, Republicans senators need to stay afloat.\n\nIn lieu of an exit question, here are Graham and Newt Gingrich backing Trump up on the \u201clynching\u201d in the House. If I were Trump watching Graham compartmentalize his disgust over the Syria withdrawal this way, going all-in on the president\u2019s behalf despite having just been shafted by him on foreign policy, I\u2019d wonder why I would ever need to do Graham a favor or listen to him on policy. McConnell\u2019s at least signaling to Trump that his further support may come at a cost. Graham seems willing to shill endlessly for Trump for nothing in return \u2014 and in this case, not even on a matter of great import. On his choice of words. In a tweet.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Hoo boy.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mm-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
