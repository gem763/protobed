He rung up Robles on strike three, leaving the Washington rookie hopping mad, and soon the ballpark was filled with angry chants at the plate umpire.\n\nWith every pitch at the World Series hurtling toward that strike zone box superimposed on TV screens, the call gets louder and louder: Bring on the robot umps!\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a hot topic,\u201d Houston manager AJ Hinch said Monday. \u201cThis is a big stage to be talking about hot topics. I guess it\u2019s always possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a little naive to think that simply letting computers generate strike or ball,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly naive to think that there\u2019s not going to be pitfalls in that scenario, as well.\u201d\n\nShortly before Robles struck out, Washington manager Dave Martinez was perturbed when a pitch by one of his relievers didn\u2019t go the Nationals\u2019 way.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Lance!\u201d he shouted from the bench. \u201cIt\u2019s the World Series! Wake up!\u201d\n\nSeveral umpires heard that hollering in Iowa. They\u2019d met in Des Moines to attend the funeral service for one of their own, Eric Cooper, who died two weeks after working the AL playoffs.\n\nTo remember their friend, they went to a favorite spot of Coop\u2019s on Sunday night. Game 5 of the World Series was on, and soon the shop talk turned to the subject of robot umps.\n\n\u201cIt did come up. And yes, it\u2019s frustrating,\u201d said Dale Scott, who umpired in the majors for more than 30 years and worked the World Series three times.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re never going to beat technology,\u201d he said. \u201cBut do you want a video game or a game played by human beings?\u201d\n\nMajor League Baseball is exploring the possibilities. The Arizona Fall League, made up of baseball\u2019s top prospects, used computers to call pitches over the past month.\n\nVideo quickly circulated of Giants youngster Jacob Heyward getting called out on a pitch that nearly bounced, then being ejected by a human ump for arguing. But the overall reviews weren\u2019t bad.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a terrible thing,\u201d Arizona prospect Seth Beer said.\n\nNo doubt there will be plenty of discussion about the robots in upcoming contract talks between umpires and MLB.\n\nMeantime, what particularly peeves umps is that TV box.\n\nScott said the actual strike zone MLB uses to evaluate umpires isn\u2019t the same. Especially on high pitches.\n\n\u201cOurs is much more accurate than what you see on TV,\u201d Scott said. \u201cDo you notice how the zone is the same for Aaron Judge and Jos\u00e9 Altuve?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut people take what they see on TV as gospel. Then you see a 92 mph pitch with a lot of movement miss the box by a half-inch and the fans go crazy. It\u2019s like, my god, what was that guy looking at?\u201d\n\nAlso, while the plate is 17 inches wide, the strike zone is three-dimensional. A curveball can clip the front and almost end up in the dirt, or hook down to catch the back part of the dish.\n\nConsider this, too: What is a strike?\n\nAs in, suppose the ball shows up side-by-side with the outside edge of the box, but there\u2019s no overlap. Ball or strike?\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a catcher, you want more pitches. As a hitter, you want the strike zone smaller. It\u2019s definitely not easy,\u201d Nationals catcher Kurt Suzuki said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be perfect. Obviously we understand that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want the strike zone to be consistent. But these guys are human,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the baseball game. You\u2019ve got to deal with it.\u201d\n\nA day before his Astros took a 3-2 lead into Game 6 on Tuesday night, Hinch saw both sides of the debate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always interested in improving the game. I\u2019m interested in advancing things that maybe we didn\u2019t think 10 years ago that were relevant. And now all of a sudden that they are,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we can better the game, I\u2019m all for it. And perhaps that\u2019s an avenue that we\u2019re going to go down some day,\u201d he said.\n\nIf that happens, Hinch had one more thought.\n\n\u201cBe careful what you wish for,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Sports Writer David Brandt contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Sports", "description": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 From the box seats to the far reaches of the bleachers, all 40,000 umpires in the stands at Nationals Park were sure they", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Alex-Brandon1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
