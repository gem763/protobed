Some didn\u2019t expect Guyger to face any repercussions at all.\n\n\u201cI, for one, was not expecting a white police officer to be convicted on the more serious charge for killing a black man, however bizarre the circumstances,\u201d wrote CNN\u2019s Jill Filipovic after Guyger was found guilty of murder on Tuesday.\n\nGuyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nHers is actually the latest in a string of high-profile cases in which a white officer who killed a Black person was found guilty. In 2018, former Texas officer Roy D. Oliver II was found guilty of murdering 15-year-old Jordan Edwards; Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke pleaded guilty to killing 17-year-old Laquan McDonald in 2014; earlier this year, a Florida jury convicted officer Nouman Raja for killing 31-year-old Corey Jones.\n\nBut experts say the peculiarities of Guyger\u2019s case make it difficult to determine whether her conviction for murder is a sign of greater police accountability going forward, or a mere aberration.\n\nPOOL New / Reuters With her new Bible in hand, former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger leaves the 204th District Court for jail after receiving a hug from Botham Jean's brother Brandt Jean in Dallas on Oct. 2.\n\nData compiled by FiveThirtyEight shows that allegations of police misconduct rarely result in charges for the officers involved, making the jury\u2019s finding on Tuesday \u2015 in which an officer accused of wrongdoing was not only charged but actually convicted \u2015 seem to some like a welcome departure from the norm. But for several reasons, Guyger\u2019s case was hardly a typical case of officer misconduct.\n\nFirstly, Guyger \u2015 unlike many officers accused of misconduct \u2015 was off-duty when she shot Botham Jean. During the trial, Guyger and her defense team claimed the officer mistakenly entered Jean\u2019s apartment thinking it was her own and shot him out of fear. But those claims were widely panned in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, and legal experts said it was too unbelievable to withstand scrutiny in court.\n\n\u201cJurors and judges are often sympathetic to officers because they think, \u2018Even if they made a mistake, they were just trying to do their job,\u2019\u201d said Paul Butler, a Georgetown Law professor and author of the book \u201cChokehold: Policing Black Men.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut here, since the officer wasn\u2019t on-duty, the jury or judge wouldn\u2019t have that sympathy,\u201d Butler told HuffPost.\n\nJean also wasn\u2019t suspected of a crime, which earned Guyger a level of derision that other self-proclaimed authority figures who have killed unarmed Black people were able to avoid. To emphasize how minimal a threat Jean posed when he was killed, the prosecution even noted that he had been shot dead while eating ice cream.\n\n\u201cA lot of jurors would be able to put themselves in the place of Mr. Jean in a way that they wouldn\u2019t to a person who is the more typical victim of police violence, which is a suspect in a case,\u201d Butler said.\n\nTo that point, another reason Guyger\u2019s trial diverged from standard cases of police misconduct is that her victim exhibited several characteristics that garnered widespread sympathy beyond the Black community. Jean was an avowed Christian, a talented singer and gainfully employed at an accounting firm.\n\nJeremy Lock / Reuters Botham Jean's mother, Allison Jean, and his father, Bertram Jean, raise their hands with their family attorneys Daryl Washington, Benjamin Crump and Lee Merritt after Guyger's murder conviction was delivered on Oct. 1, 2019.\n\nAttorney Benjamin Crump, who represents Jean\u2019s family, said Jean\u2019s stellar reputation played a role in the outcome of this case.\n\n\u201cBotham Jean was a near-perfect person of color, so this jury had to make history in America today,\u201d Crump told reporters after Guyger\u2019s guilty verdict was announced. \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t take all that for unarmed Black and brown people to get justice,\u201d he added.\n\nBut Butler told HuffPost that there was cause for optimism in the Guyger case, even if the specifics make it impossible to declare the conviction part of some trend of accountability.\n\nNamely, he said the diverse jury in Guyger\u2019s case, which reportedly included 10 nonwhite jurors out of the 12, may have played a role in the conviction. In courthouses across the country, the jury selection process has been seen as a method to weed out Black and brown potential jurors whose understanding of race \u2015 and whose interpretation of the law \u2015 may differ greatly from their white counterparts\u2019.\n\nButler said many jurisdictions, including Dallas County, where Guyger was convicted, have taken steps that effectively diversify the jury pool by including people who have a driver\u2019s license or state ID, rather than merely selecting from the voter registration rolls as is typical.\n\n\u201cWhen jurisdictions expand the jury pool to actually reflect the community, that results in more diverse juries,\u201d he said.\n\nBroadly speaking, various social justice movements have brought more attention to cases in which police officers have shot unarmed Black people. Accepting as a caveat that Guyger wasn\u2019t on-duty when she killed Jean, her case existed in an environment that has seen social justice advocates pressure the legal system to mete out justice without regard for whether the offender is an officer or not.\n\nIn 2014, St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch was widely criticized for failing to convince a grand jury to indict former St. Louis police officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed an unarmed teenager named Michael Brown in the city of Ferguson. That scrutiny lingers to this day, Butler said, arguing this pressure may have played a role in charges being brought against Guyger in the first place.\n\nWhile prosecutors \u2015 many of whom are elected officials \u2015 may be reluctant to bring charges against officers accused of wrongdoing for political purposes, they are at least aware of a constituency that will hold them accountable if charges aren\u2019t brought.\n\n\u201cIn jurisdictions that have large minority populations, prosecutors are starting to understand that their constituents want police officers who commit crimes to be prosecuted like anyone else who\u2019s committed a crime,\u201d Butler said.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s more incentive for prosecutors to bring these cases.\u201d", "description": "The former Dallas police officer was the latest in a string of officers convicted in cases that involved the murder of unarmed Black people.", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d97b015210000510030d2ba.jpeg?cache=mpwenwszlq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
