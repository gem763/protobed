A replay review showed that the ball landed out. That\u2019s when Bryan pointed toward the chair umpire and line judge with a finger, then placed the head of his racket on his shoulder and pretended to \u201caim\u201d the handle.\n\nIt\u2019s the highest fine given to a man so far at this year\u2019s U.S. Open.\n\nU.S. Tennis Association spokesman Brendan McIntyre said: \u201cThe gesture warranted that amount.\u201d\n\nThe Bryans\u2019 match Saturday night was played hours after a man in Texas shot seven people to death and injured 22 others.\n\nThat was the 25th mass killing in the U.S. so far this year, matching the number in all of 2018, according to The AP/USATODAY/Northeastern University mass murder database. The database tracks homicides where four or more people are killed, not including the offender.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mike Bryan has been fined $10,000 at the U.S. Open for pointing his racket as if it were a gun during a doubles match", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/AP_19242745044032_c0-0-4115-2399_s1770x1032.jpg?adf054931f38969817ea98b2819844c258efc4c3"}
