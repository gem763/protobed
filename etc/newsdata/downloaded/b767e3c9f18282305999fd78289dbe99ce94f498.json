For customers it means good \u2013 and sometimes amazing \u2013 deals for the quick and savvy, and analyst say some potential buyers have been saving up for months in anticipation.\n\nMany retailers, both online and bricks-and-mortar, are likely to draw out discounts over the course of a week, starting on the weekend of 23 November. But, as has become tradition, they will be keeping some of their biggest and best discounts under tight wraps until the very end.\n\nSo we turned to history to figure out which retailers are likely to offer the best deals on electronics, fridges, inflatable pools and nappies again this year.\n\nThese are the retailers we'll be watching closely on Black Friday 2019, based on their sales and discounts last year.\n\nOne of the biggest winners on Black Friday 2018 was Takealot, with R196 million in sales last year - a 125% year-on-year growth.\n\nThese are some of the discounts that caught our eye last year, and makes it worth watching on Black Friday 2019\n\nHisense 65\" Ultra HD Premium Quantum Dot TV R19,999(was R34,999)\n\niPhone 6S 64GB - Space Grey CPO R4,999 (was R6,999)\n\nHuawei P20 Lite 64GB LTE- Blue R4,499 (was R5,999)\n\nDStv Explora 2 Fully Installed R1,299 (was R2,499)\n\nHoover - Wet & Dry Vacuum Cleaner R699 (was R1,199)\n\nThe company's sales numbers also show that it had big hits with folding camp chairs, nappies, and various electronics.\n\nGame\n\nPink retailer Game had big discounts on items like TVs, computers \u2013 and inflatable pools \u2013 last year.
