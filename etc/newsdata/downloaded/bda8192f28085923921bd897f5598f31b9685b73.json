The measures would apply to companies with revenues of more than US$821 million that operate across international borders and have a \u201csustained and significant involvement in the economy.\u201d The OECD is also proposing a \u201clegally binding\u201d dispute-settlement mechanism to arbitrate between companies and governments. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: The proposals are designed to stop governments from creating a fragmented taxation system by imposing country-specific levies on Big Tech, which France has passed and officials in the U.K. and Canada\u2019s Liberal Party are considering. The Trump administration has opposed the French measure, threatening retaliatory tariffs.
