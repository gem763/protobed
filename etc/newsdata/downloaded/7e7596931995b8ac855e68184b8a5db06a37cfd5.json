Time and again, this most English of interest groups has been on the wrong side of history, advocating for a status quo that has slowly been eroded by the steady tide of human advancement. And yet the Tories have survived at each turn, their genius lying not in an ability to conserve, but in an ability to adapt\u2014reluctantly accepting reform and, over time, embracing the ancient, eternal nobility of the new settlement as if it had always been there. Britain\u2019s Conservative Party\u2014the modern incarnation of Toryism, and its most dominant and persistent political force\u2014does not burn bright, but it endures. Its cause is not ideological, but temperamental. Its strength is that while other political philosophies come and go, the conservative temperament remains, skeptical, tribal, cautious. Its allegiances are here and now, not abstract or academic: monarchy, Church, country.\n\nThe primary Tory duty is to govern in order to check the utopian passions of the tidy mind. \u201cThe Conservative Party exists, has always existed and can only exist to acquire and exercise power,\u201d writes Robin Harris in The Conservatives. \u201cIt does not exist to be loved, hated or even respected \u2026 It is an institution with a purpose, not an organism with a soul.\u201d Set in this light, Britain\u2019s current crisis over its withdrawal from the European Union is just the latest entry in the long roll call of political upheaval that English Toryism has faced and\u2014so far\u2014outlived. Its challenge now is to do so again in the age of Brexit, Donald Trump, and a surge in nationalism across the Western world, which are threatening to upend the basic political divisions in the United Kingdom, from class and economic interest to identity and place, just as Britain embarks on a mission to reimagine its global standing. After giving the country a referendum on its EU membership, the Conservative Party has found itself with the job of trying to enact the result\u2014one its past two prime ministers did not want and did not expect. Boris Johnson, the third Conservative prime minister in three years, though the first who campaigned for Brexit, is now tasked with taking Britain out of the EU on terms acceptable to his party, a majority in Parliament, and the country, each of whom has different, often competing, goals and desires. And he must do so before an October 31 deadline that he has insisted is \u201cdo or die.\u201d\n\nAs the Conservative Party gathers for its annual conference in Manchester, it faces a set of challenges as daunting as any in its history. Squeezed from the right by Nigel Farage\u2019s new Brexit Party\u2014which demands a quick, \u201cclean\u201d break from the EU\u2014and from the left by the massed ranks of anti-Brexit Remainers, it has a precariously narrow route to staying in power. It\u2019s caught in a political trap, heralding an even bigger crisis for Johnson, the Conservative Party, and the country.\n\nAnd the crisis is not simply domestic. Success for the Tories\u2014delivering Brexit while remaining in power\u2014could lead to a shift toward an entirely new economic relationship with Europe and the United States, raising questions about the continued membership of Scotland and Northern Ireland in the U.K., and causing significant friction with its closest neighbor, Ireland. Failure, by contrast, is likely to presage the appointment of the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister, along with a program of government that could see Brexit canceled in a second referendum, an end to the post-Thatcherite economic consensus, and a revolutionized foreign policy outwardly hostile to many of Britain\u2019s traditional security allies, including the U.S. and NATO, while sympathetic to longtime adversaries such as Russia and Iran. Three and a half centuries after its founding, the oldest and most stubbornly successful political party in the democratic world (if one traces it to its Tory roots) is experiencing an existential crisis, and the fallout is not simply a British interest, but one that could have profound implications across Europe, the United States, and the entire Western security alliance.\n\nToryism was born of the tumultuous struggle for supremacy between King and Parliament. Its guiding attitudes centered on \u201cauthority, allegiance and tradition,\u201d as they do today, according to Harris, one of the party\u2019s preeminent historians. Its instincts were to support Charles I and his divine right to govern\u2014a cause already out of date by the time his reign ended on the scaffold in January 1649\u2014but as an organized political faction, Toryism only really emerged in the years after the monarchy\u2019s restoration in 1660 and the succession crisis that followed. The Tories were for James, Duke of York, who was the presumptive heir to the throne, but a Catholic. England had broken with Rome the century before, and fears of Catholic\u2014Continental\u2014absolutism remained. The Whigs, the Tories\u2019 opponents and champions of parliamentary power, were pushing an \u201cexclusion bill\u201d banning Catholics from the throne. For the Tories, the conflict saw two of the party\u2019s founding principles clash: allegiance to the monarchy, and allegiance to the established Church of England. The status quo was not clear, so the Tories chose King and inheritance. The Tories defeated the exclusion bill, but James II lasted three years before the Whiggish Glorious Revolution swept him from power. In came William of Orange; his wife, Mary; and the beginnings of constitutional monarchy. Soon Catholics would be formally banned from the throne for good (they still are). Toryism had lost and the Whiggish Parliament had won\u2014a pattern that would continue for much of the next 50 years.\n\nToryism, then, began life in practically permanent opposition\u2014representing a traditional world of the landed class, but almost always out of power. It was only in the 19th century that the Tories got serious, developing into today\u2019s Conservative Party. The spark was the Great Reform Act of 1832, which extended the franchise to the new metropolises of industrial Britain\u2014a measure long fought by Tories in Parliament. The act changed Britain, and the Tory party. \u201cAfter 1832 the old land-owning aristocracy steadily lost power,\u201d George Orwell wrote in his essay on England, \u201cThe Lion and the Unicorn.\u201d \u201cBut instead of disappearing or becoming a fossil they simply intermarried with the merchants, manufacturers and financiers who had replaced them, and soon turned them into accurate copies of themselves.\u201d Although they suffered heavy losses in the first election with an extended franchise, the Tories bounced back just three years later. Robert Peel became the first \u201cConservative\u201d prime minister, and displayed true Tory elasticity\u2014adapting to the Great Reform Act by accepting it. It was, he said, the \u201cfinal and irrevocable settlement of a great constitutional question.\u201d But even as the Tories became the Conservative Party, the cautious instincts of Toryism remained. In his \u201cTamworth Manifesto,\u201d Peel declared that while he respected the Great Reform Act as a \u201ccareful review of institutions,\u201d he would not support it if it meant living in \u201ca perpetual vortex of agitation.\u201d He did not want the government \u201cadopting every popular impression of the day.\u201d He was a true Tory, but also one with an eye to power\u2014a combination that has held to this day.\n\nWhy does Toryism endure if it so often unsuccessful? How does it oppose the extension of the franchise for years, only to win the second election after its successful passage? The Tory answer is that while circumstances change, its temperament remains: skeptical, traditional, patriotic, conservative. Conservatives hold that while they may be shunned by the intellectual elite, they are more in line with the personalities and instincts of ordinary men and women. They might lose touch from time to time, missing the stifled desires for change that bubble up from those who cannot access the benefits of society, but they always find a way to return to the real England (or, across the Atlantic, the real America). \u201cBritain and Twitter: They are not the same thing,\u201d David Cameron quipped after his electoral triumph in 2015. Substitute Twitter with the talking shop of the day and it could have been said at any time in the previous 300 years. In Jonathan Swift\u2019s The Conduct of the Allies, published in 1711, he noted: \u201cIt is the folly of too many, to mistake the echo of a London coffee-house for the voice of the kingdom.\u201d The sentiment appears again and again, and not just in Britain. Richard Nixon referred to \u201cthe silent majority\u201d of Americans ignored by coastal liberals. For Australia\u2019s conservative leader Scott Morrison, following his surprise win this year, it was the \u201cquiet Australians.\u201d Silent, shy, quiet\u2014but enduring.\n\nTo the Tories, here lies the nobility of their cause: They are the quiet defenders of the little man from those seeking to impose a different way of life upon him without his consent. The little man is rooted in country and custom. This seam links apparently unconnected concerns, from gay marriage to immigration to the European Union. In contrast to its image today, for much of its history Toryism \u201crepresented the creed of the Country against the Court, the \u2018outs\u2019 against the \u2018ins\u2019, the squires against the moneyed men and the metropolis,\u201d Harris writes. The word Tory itself even hints at this self-image of the outsider: derived from the Irish toraighe, meaning \u201ca pursuer,\u201d referring to the dispossessed Catholic Irish.\n\nHistory suggests this Tory instinct falls in and out of line with the country it seeks to govern, adopting a rhythm of defeat and acquiescence that held in the 17th century as much as in the 20th and 21st: opposing the supremacy of the House of Commons and Irish Home Rule, the end of empire and nationalization, the devolution of power from London to Scotland and Wales, the minimum wage. All were rejected, then accepted\u2014and throughout, the Tories endured. Cameron\u2019s 2016 referendum on EU membership was an attempt to stick with this tradition, to get his party to finally accept Britain\u2019s decision to join the European Economic Community in 1972. Cameron hoped a referendum would settle the question, allowing party\u2014and country\u2014to move on. Instead Conservatives have to adapt to an altogether different revolution: Brexit. To the Conservative Party\u2019s critics, internal and external, what is so different about the current moment is that the party is leading a revolution, not resisting it, junking skepticism for wide-eyed idealism. Its pursuit of Brexit, they say, is a break from its long tradition as a restraining, pragmatic force. Instead of leading Britain out of the EU without an exit agreement, tearing up the legal basis of 40 years of economic and political integration in one fell swoop, the party, this view goes, should have tried to contain Brexit\u2019s excesses. According to many of the moderate members of Parliament whom Johnson ejected from the party, the hard-liners have embraced the very \u201cperpetual vortex of agitation\u201d that Peel opposed. The party is no longer Tory, they say. (The irony is that to Peel\u2019s critics, he too was no Tory, abandoning the party\u2019s traditional protectionism, which ensured high prices for the landed class, in favor of free trade. Peel\u2019s decision to repeal the protectionist Corn Laws split the Conservative Party, costing it\u2014and him\u2014power.)\n\nMuch of the venom directed at Johnson\u2019s key adviser, Dominic Cummings, stems from a supposed lack of Toryism. Cummings led the Vote Leave campaign before joining the prime minister in 10 Downing Street, yet has never been a member of the Conservative Party and openly disparages many of its elected representatives. Michael Gove, one of the leading Brexiteers in government and Cummings\u2019s former boss, invites similar philosophical suspicions. Cameron, a former close friend, described Gove as a \u201cMaoist,\u201d not a Tory. But Toryism is more complex than conservation. It reflects a series of instincts that can\u2014and do\u2014conflict: authority and freedom, Church and monarchy, and ultimately, the reflexive desire for stability and the long-standing allegiances to country and custom, to provincial England rather than the London coffeehouse. Related Stories Can Brexit Be Stopped?\n\nBritain\u2019s Political Chaos Shows Everything Is Okay\n\nWhat Boris Johnson Did to the World\u2019s Most Stable Democracy\n\nJeremy Corbyn\u2019s Britain Would Reshape Western Alliances Mark Wallace, the executive editor of Conservative Home, an influential website for Conservative activists, told me the party has always been a combination of \u201cinstinct and alliance,\u201d mixing its habitual caution with a difficult-to-assess judgment about when it\u2019s okay to move on. \u201cWhen those tipping points come is very hard to judge,\u201d he said. Brexit sits uneasily for Britain\u2019s main political parties, the Conservatives and Labour, because it does not fit into easy categories of left or right. There is a Tory case for leaving: While Brexit involves change, it also means leaving a multinational structure that is a different source of change (and one, Brexiteers argue, that they can less easily control).\n\nThe 2016 referendum means the status quo is not an option. To many Conservatives, that vote marked the constitutional turning point, and the Tories are simply doing what they have always done: trying to adapt. \u201cThere can be moments when the whole nation suddenly swings together and does the same thing, like a herd of cattle facing a wolf,\u201d Orwell wrote. This does not describe Brexit Britain\u2014divided and radicalized since the referendum. But it might describe the Tories. When a majority of the country voted to leave the EU, Britain\u2019s political landscape changed forever, setting in motion a fundamental reshaping of British politics that continues to this day, further splitting the country the longer it remains unresolved. Brexit, according to this argument, is more akin to the Thatcherite revolution of the 1980s, which united Tory traditionalists and radicals in a program to overhaul the postwar economic consensus. While that moment was not conservative in its literal sense, it was nevertheless Tory, appealing to provincial England\u2019s instincts of self-reliance, patriotism, property, and authority, just as a similar argument did in the United States under Ronald Reagan. In the \u201970s, the Conservative leader Edward Heath had asked voters, \u201cWho runs the country?\u201d but had been unable to force an answer. Margaret Thatcher decided it was \u201cpeople like us\u201d and set about winning them back. In 2016, voters were asked to \u201ctake back control.\u201d Both Thatcher\u2019s and the Brexiteer\u2019s were radical messages, but Toryism runs throughout.\n\nIn 2017, the Conservative Party under Theresa May, Johnson\u2019s immediate predecessor, lost control of Parliament; since then, its grasp on the political situation has only gotten worse. In Parliament, the Conservatives are now down to 288 MPs, having lost nine anti-Brexit MPs in defections to other parties and factions, and a further 21 in a mass expulsion over their support for a parliamentary rebellion to stop a \u201cno deal\u201d exit on October 31. Pollsters I spoke with suggested that, given the rapid polarization of the country along Remain and Leave lines in the two years since the 2017 vote, with the Tories having embraced Brexit and the opposition parties now largely united against it, any future election is likely to see the governing party fall even further behind in areas of the country that voted Remain\u2014losing seats to the Scottish National Party in Scotland and the Liberal Democrats in parts of England. The dilemma for the Conservatives is that the harder they go on Brexit, the more they risk losing seats elsewhere: They might win votes in Leave-heavy areas of northern England, but lose them in the wealthy, Remain-supporting south. \u201cWhat you gain on the swings you lose on the roundabouts,\u201d John Curtice, Britain\u2019s leading pollster, said in describing the conundrum to me. The more territory the Tories lose in Remain-ia, the more they need to take in Brexit-land. Andrew Cooper, Cameron\u2019s former pollster, told me his models suggested that were an election held imminently, the Tories were likely to lose as many as a dozen seats in Scotland and up to 25 in England. \u201cThe strong polarization of attitudes on either side of the Brexit debate has altered the dynamics of the electoral battleground,\u201d he said. \u201cSeats that are strongly anti-Brexit could come into play even though they ostensibly have fairly big Tory majorities.\u201d In Cooper\u2019s view, at least 30 Tory seats are vulnerable, including those held by the former party leader Iain Duncan Smith and even, potentially, Johnson\u2019s in West London.\n\nWere the Tories to suffer anything like this number of losses, they would need to win about 65 seats in other parts of the country, largely from Labour, to secure a working majority in Parliament. This would amount to something like a 25 percent increase in the number of parliamentary seats they currently hold. For that to happen, Curtice calculates, the Conservatives would need a lead in the polls of about eight percentage points\u2014the very top end of some recent polling.\n\nTo win an election, the Tories must unite the Brexit vote as much as possible and hope the Remain opposition splits among the two national center-left parties, Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Here looms Farage, the anti-EU campaigner who created the single-issue Brexit Party this year, which is advocating for a no-deal break from Brussels and now sits on 10 to 15 percent support in the polls. The Tory challenge is simple. They must squeeze the Brexit Party to eek out enough of a lead to secure a majority. Matthew Goodwin, another pollster, has calculated that if Johnson can cut support for the Brexit Party by five percentage points, he could win a healthy majority. But that\u2019s a big if\u2014since his elevation to the premiership, the Brexit Party\u2019s numbers have stayed rock solid. Farage is offering Johnson a pact: Support a no-deal Brexit, and he will step aside in favor of the Conservatives. But for Johnson to do so means adopting a policy that may be too radical for the country and his party in Parliament to stomach\u2014and that might only lead to further losses in areas of the country that voted Remain.\n\nThe nightmare for Johnson is a repeat of 2017, when early polls suggested the Tories were going to sweep into old Labour territory. Instead, Labour\u2019s traditional heartland stuck with the party\u2014just. \u201cBrexit on its own was not enough to get a lot of cultural conservatives,\u201d Cooper said. What\u2019s more, old Labour seats were harder for the Tories to reach than old Tory seats were for Labour. The result was the Tories went forward across the north, but not enough to capture the territory, while letting Labour swoop in to win Conservative seats in the south. The party had gone forward and backward at the same time\u2014and ended up with fewer seats than before. There are, however, historical examples in which territory suddenly flips\u2014just look at the United States. Until 1964, no Republican candidate for president had won a single state in the Deep South since Reconstruction. Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina, the heart of the Confederacy, could not vote for the party of Lincoln, and the Democrats were the party of white segregationists. Even in Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s 1952 Republican landslide, the South stayed blue. In 1964, that all changed. Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, which transformed the lives of millions of Americans\u2014and remade the country\u2019s political map. Also that year, the Deep South voted Republican, and in the 13 presidential elections since, it has stayed solidly Republican, only once voting as a bloc for a Democratic candidate\u2014in 1974, for Georgia\u2019s Jimmy Carter. From 1972 to 2016, the Republican Party swept the board in the five Deep South states eight times out of 12, and won four out of five three times.\n\nThe Grand Old Party of the Yankee North\u2014which had ended slavery, won the Civil War, and overseen Reconstruction\u2014was now the South\u2019s party. In 1964, Strom Thurmond, the racist, pro-segregation southern Democrat, became a Republican. Four years later, Democrats won less than 10 percent of the white southern vote. But while the Republicans gained the South, they lost everywhere else. They had chosen a radical conservative, Barry Goldwater, as their candidate for the 1964 campaign, and he proved too much for the country. States that had voted for Nixon four years earlier\u2014Maine and Oregon, California and Indiana\u2014now voted Democrat. Johnson gave up his southern flank, and his party made the jump in enough of the rest of the country to compensate. Some historians and pollsters in Britain now predict Brexit could have the same effect here, redrawing the map in a manner that opens up opportunities and dangers for both of the main political parties: for Labour in its northern heartlands, which voted for Brexit, and the Conservatives in metropolitan centers across the country, who backed Remain. The lessons from history, however, are not simple. American politics before 1964 was not divided on simple ideological grounds. A conservative alliance united southern Democrats and midwestern Republicans, holding back issues like civil rights. Both parties contained social liberals as well. But in 1964, a new divide opened up that was more closely aligned to political philosophy: conservative and liberal.\n\nThe Democrats were the first to win in this new world, but they would soon be drowned by its long-term reality. \u201cHere is one time, at least, in which history was written by the losers,\u201d writes Rick Perlstein in Before the Storm, which recounts America\u2019s conservative revolution. As the Civil Rights Act and Goldwater changed the American political divide, might Brexit do the same? Curtice\u2019s research shows that 77 percent of voters say they define their political viewpoint either very strongly or strongly by whether they are Leave or Remain\u2014and only 37 percent by political party. The long-term consequences of this are likely to outlast the immediate Tory struggle to stay in power after the next election, just as it did in the United States. At the moment, Britain\u2019s electoral divide is largely based on wealth, diversity, and location. The richer and more rural the area (which is closely linked to how diverse it is), the more likely it is to vote Conservative; the poorer and more urban, the higher the chances it will vote Labour. Plotted on a table, with diversity as the X axis (running left to right, from most diverse to least) and wealth as the Y axis (running bottom to top, poor to rich), safe Tory seats sit in the top-right quadrant\u2014rich and white\u2014and safe Labour seats in the bottom left, poor and diverse. A similar divide used to hold in the United States. What has changed in both countries, as well as in France and Germany, is the appeal of parties\u2014and causes\u2014drawing their support from poor whites. Analysis by Cooper\u2019s polling firm, Populus, illustrates this pattern across the West. What unites support for Donald Trump, Brexit, Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally in France, and the far-right Alternative for Germany is demographics: They all draw their support from the bottom-right quadrant.\n\nIn the U.S., according to Cooper\u2019s analysis, Trump\u2019s victory is not a sudden, dramatic shift, but another step along the demographic path that American politics has been treading since the mid-1990s. Beginning with Bill Clinton\u2019s victory in 1996, the Democratic Party\u2019s support base has slowly moved up the wealth table, while Republican supporters have become poorer. The one constant is diversity: The more diverse the area, the more Democratic it is, and vice versa. Brexit has set in motion a similar shift in Britain, in Cooper\u2019s reading. Support for Remain was highest in diverse, prosperous Britain\u2014support for Brexit in white, non-urban areas. In the elections since Brexit, both national and European, Labour has steadily appealed to more university graduates and urban professionals, while retaining support among minorities. The Tory base, meanwhile, has become steadily less wealthy, but just as white. With urban, Remain areas more and more off-limits to the Tories, this trend may soon accelerate as the party focuses its energy on the parts of Britain that voted Brexit\u2014demographically British Trump-land. The consequences of this pursuit for the Conservative Party\u2014and for the future shape of British politics\u2014are potentially enormous. The reality for Conservatives is, their possible new voter base is not composed of free-market economic liberals in the mold of Boris Johnson and much of the party\u2019s leadership. \u201cThe voters the Tories are picking up do not want the economy run in the way the CBI wants it run,\u201d Curtice said, referring to the Confederation of British Industry, the country\u2019s Big Business pressure group. Cooper, equally, said these new voters shared many of the same instincts as Trump\u2019s supporters on social issues. When asked whether the following were a force for good or ill\u2014multiculturalism, social liberalism, immigration, the green movement, feminism, globalization, and the internet\u2014Trump supporters and Brexit supporters had a high level of overlap in their answers, Cooper\u2019s research has found. In his view, that is turning the Tory party into an English Nationalist Party, one that lacks support in the U.K.\u2019s other constituent nations. \u201cIt asserts the importance of national \u2018sovereignty\u2019 and reactionary protectionism of its view of national culture and values, over everything else,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Cooper and other Tory modernizers close to Cameron, who advocated a combination of social liberalism and economic conservatism to appeal to middle-class, urban professionals, this change is profound and regrettable, as well as shortsighted. As Britain becomes steadily more diverse and urban, they believe that this revised conservative offer is one of ever-diminishing returns. In 1987, according to Cooper, only one constituency in the country had a nonwhite population of more than 30 percent. Today there are 80 such constituencies, and only four voted Tory in the most recent election. Conservative optimists instead argue that with Brexit, whole new tracts of the country have opened up to them: poor, white England, which previously felt no affinity with the Conservative Party, largely seen as the party of the rich. If the Tories can win these voters with conservative social policies and a new economic policy, they may be able to defeat a Labour Party that has moved too far to the left on economic and social issues for many voters. The danger for the Conservatives today is that history repeats itself; the party might create a new country, but one that is different from the buccaneering, free-trading, outward-looking Global Britain Johnson has advocated. To liberal-minded Tories, this poses an uncomfortable problem: What if the country really wants left-wing economics and right-wing social policies?", "description": "Britain\u2019s Conservative Party has endured for hundreds of years, but in trying to pull the country out of the EU, it will have to adapt to endure.", "authors": ["Tom Mctague"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX74ZE4/facebook.jpg?1569680498", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
