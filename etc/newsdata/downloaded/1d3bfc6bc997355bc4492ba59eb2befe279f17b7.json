Despite the recent Ahmari-French debate, despite the odd couple nature of fusionist conservatism, despite the populist wave against \u201cthe establishment,\u201d the Republican Party led by President Trump has been much more effective at corralling dissent and providing cover for its disparate elements than the Democratic Party. Trump has served as a symbolic avatar for the GOP\u2019s \u201cfurther right\u201d constituents even while failing to truly enact any of the main policies they elected him for, whereas the left of the Democratic Party has real political power and is determined to use it\u2014if not to win then at least to sabotage those whom they consider too far to the center.\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s success in railroading rebel elements is twofold. In terms of the voting public, it\u2019s meant creating an ideological environment where those who probably wouldn\u2019t agree on much cast ballots for the same party without thinking twice. In terms of politicians, it\u2019s meant guiding even those who don\u2019t agree towards a more or less favorable disposition and voting pattern. The GOP has managed to create an atmosphere of inevitability and in doing so has become a daunting machine that takes internal opposition and steamrolls it into a giant, unified political and social product.\n\nOn the politician side, the about-face of Senator Lindsey Graham serves as a prime example. Despite a barrage of strong statements against Trump during the last election, Graham is now a dedicated cheerleader for the president who half the time sounds like Rudy Giuliani. Senator Mitt Romney, meanwhile, is hesitant to do more than intone about the \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d nature of Trump\u2019s Ukraine phone call. But he still isn\u2019t a real threat to party unity because he offers no genuinely competitive ideological vision apart from speaking more nicely and not constantly doing wildly stupid, self-sabotaging things.\n\nYet for all these stands, the Republican Party has been brutally efficient at getting members to fall in line, which is particularly impressive (or obtuse, depending on your view) given the erratic and contradictory actions of Trump. To be sure, some real internal disputes do exist on matters of trade and foreign policy. Nonetheless, the GOP has managed to successfully sidle towards Trump\u2019s vague nationalism and nativism without letting its internal disagreements become particularly significant or divisive to voters.\n\nIt\u2019s an entirely different story for the Democrats. Their divisions are not built around personality or values rhetoric or degrees of scale, but around hard policy. The Democrats have fundamental and publicly visible disagreements over health care, foreign policy, taxes, and immigration, to name only a few. The wings of the Democratic Party\u2014and its voting blocs\u2014are so far apart that the very idea of them being in the same coalition is crumbling. From wildly different receptions of an off-color joke by Joe Biden to Dianne Feinstein\u2019s dismissive reaction to young climate activists crowding outside her office, the old Democratic Party and the new woke Democratic Party are miles apart.\n\nThe Bernie and AOC faction is plainly at odds with the Biden and Pelosi faction. The Justice Democrat movement spearheaded by Cenk Uygur and left-wing commentator Kyle Kulinski is not onboard with the corporate Democratic agenda. And social democrats in Congress don\u2019t bother with the niceties of the Hill. No matter how skillfully the Democratic National Committee tries to paper over it or how often the Biden wing parrots far left talking points on gender, abortion, and LGBT issues that don\u2019t cost them a thing and make good buzzwords in campaign ads, the Democratic Party is more like a sprawling carnival than a big tent. Which wing you think is the freak show depends upon your beliefs, but there\u2019s no doubt that the encore featuring everyone up on the main stage isn\u2019t convincing anyone. Heck, some members of Biden\u2019s own family even voted for Trump in 2016. How are you supposed to have party unity when you don\u2019t even have family unity?\n\nWill impeachment inquiries really be enough to defibrillate the Democratic Party? Every time Trump does some new outrageous thing, the Democrats pounce in concert with media reports\u2014or, in this latest case, slightly ahead of them. The indignation, the breathless anger, the shock, the press conferences: it\u2019s the last thing that brings a party together. Yet no matter how many times the last straw is drawn, it turns out not to be the last straw. \u201cWe hate Trump and he is very bad\u201d didn\u2019t work in 2016 and it won\u2019t work now. Even if Trump gets shown the door in some way or another (despite the Republican-run Senate?), his ouster won\u2019t fix what\u2019s wrong with the Democrats.\n\nIf anything, impeachment inquiries will serve only as a pause button on the constant exposure of Democrats\u2019 internal divisions, not an actual solution. Biden is the ultimate centrist, and a rising number of independent and Democratic voters may well stay home rather than vote for him, even against Trump. The progressive, social democratic wing may not have a real way to stop Biden or his equivalent from becoming the nominee, but they can depress voter turnout on the left.\n\nThe silliness of arguing over Crowdstrike server conspiracies and an endless back-and-forth between Biden and Trump over what Hunter Biden did or did not do in Ukraine is superseded only by the silliness of the Democrats constantly trying the same political strategy and hoping for different results.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton couldn\u2019t beat Trump in 2016, what does that say about her and her campaign? If the Democrats can\u2019t achieve party unity in the face of Trump, what does that say about the extent of their internal contradictions? These are questions the Democrats are going to have to answer\u2014and fast\u2014if they want to do more than talk on TV.\n\nPaul Brian is a freelance journalist.
