Those with just \u2018competent\u2019 English do not score any points.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel\u2019s new immigation bill will use a new points-based system, under which people will be allowed to live and work in the UK if they score highly enough on measures including education, salary level, skills - and a willingness to work away from the South East\n\nMigrants from in-demand professions such as doctors, nurses or computer programmers, also score more highly. But it is the attempt to spread the new arrivals around the country by awarding a higher score for those who will work in low-income areas which is likely to attract most attention.\n\nLast night, a source close to Ms Patel said that the aim of the plan was to make sure that the deprived areas of the country which backed Brexit received a fair share of the influx of skilled staff.\n\nThe source said: \u2018A lot of the areas that voted to leave have seen huge numbers of unskilled migrants moving in, while the more highly educated workers have piled into London.\n\n\u2018While nobody is against opening the country up to more high-skilled immigration, the benefits have to be spread more evenly.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re in the early days of drawing up the new points-based immigration system, but are thinking about how it could be designed to make sure places other than London feel the benefits.\u2019\n\nAccording to No 10, the Queen\u2019s Speech will be devoted to \u2018getting Brexit done\u2019, with a series of measures designed to allow the UK to \u2018seize the opportunities\u2019 presented by leaving the EU.\n\nCentral to Boris Johnson\u2019s legislative programme will be a Withdrawal Agreement Bill, containing the details of any deal achieved at this week\u2019s EU Summit.\n\nNo 10 says that it will \u2018move at pace to secure its passage before October 31\u2019.\n\nBut the Queen\u2019s Speech will also offer a foretaste of the next Conservative Election manifesto, with Bills boosting spending on the National Health Service, crime, science and infrastructure.\n\nIt will also include an attempt to tackle the thorny issue of social care, which helped to torpedo the Conservatives\u2019 2017 Election campaign because of the controversy over Theresa May\u2019s so-called \u2018dementia tax\u2019.\n\nGovernment advisers helping to draw up the Queen\u2019s Speech have jokingly referred to it as the \u2018People\u2019s Speech\u2019, in reference to the Election campaign that Mr Johnson is likely to frame as a \u2018people versus Parliament\u2019 battle.\n\nMs Patel, who says that her new system of immigration will break with the philosophy of a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 for migrants and replace it with the principle of \u2018control with compassion\u2019, is a longstanding Brexit supporter.\n\nShe says she is keen to deliver on the Leave campaign\u2019s promise to \u2018take back control\u2019 of the country\u2019s borders and restore public faith in the system.\n\nBoris is counting on the Mortgage Mums Margaret Thatcher had \u2018Essex Man\u2019 to sweep her to power, while Tony Blair turned to \u2018Mondeo Man\u2019 and \u2018Worcester Woman\u2019 to turn the tide. Now a new target voter group will enter the political lexicon \u2013 \u2018Mortgage Mums\u2019 \u2013 and Boris Johnson hopes they will secure him a Commons majority. A private polling briefing at Downing Street on Friday revealed that the path to a Conservative victory lies in retaining Brexit supporters who voted Tory in 2017 and \u2018love-bombing\u2019 working women aged between 35 and 55 who have a mortgage. While \u2018Worcester Woman\u2019 was a working-class female in her 30s who worried about quality of life issues with little interest in politics, \u2018Mortgage Mums\u2019 are lower middle-class joint-breadwinners with a keen eye on the economy but who are sick of \u2018austerity\u2019. A Tory source said: \u2018Our polling shows if just one in five of these hardworking Brits switched from Labour, it could tip the balance.\u2019 Last week The Mail on Sunday revealed that Mr Johnson\u2019s election manifesto will be co-authored by two women, with high-spending pledges on the NHS, police and education.\n\nThe Home Secretary has arranged for Australian government officials to fly over to help implement the new system. Earlier this month she met Peter Dutton, her Australian counterpart, while both ministers were in the US for talks with Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nMs Patel was applauded by Tory members at the party\u2019s annual conference in Manchester earlier this month when she said that she would \u2018end the free movement of people once and for all\u2019.\n\nThe Home Office has also drafted a new Extradition Bill which will allow the deportation of suspects who are wanted abroad to be fast-tracked. It will give police the power to immediately arrest and extradite criminals who are the subject of Interpol red notices without applying to the courts \u2013 as long as the request has been made by a \u2018trusted country\u2019, rather than states such as Russia, where there are concerns about the justice system.\n\nThe Bill is designed to replace many of the powers which the police possess under the European Arrest Warrant system, which will disappear after Brexit.\n\nMr Johnson said last night: \u2018Getting Brexit done by October 31 is absolutely crucial, and we are continuing to work on an exit deal so we can move on to negotiating a future relationship based on free trade and friendly co-operation with our European friends.\n\n\u2018But the people of this country don\u2019t just want us to sort out Brexit. They want their NHS to be stronger, their streets safer, their wifi faster, the air they breathe cleaner, their kids\u2019 schools better-funded \u2013 and this optimistic and ambitious Queen\u2019s Speech sets us on a course to make all that happen, and more besides.\n\n\u2018After one of the least active parliaments in living memory, the proposals we are bringing forward will get this country moving again.\n\n\u2018This is a Queen\u2019s Speech that will deliver for every corner of the UK and make this, once again, the greatest place on earth.\n\n\u2018Public trust in Parliament is at an all-time low, but Conservatives are determined to reinvigorate Parliament and demonstrate to the public that the issues that matter to them are being properly addressed.\u2019\n\nPriti: Use foreign aid to stop illegal migrants\n\nMillions of pounds of foreign aid money would be diverted into a new crackdown on people smugglers who help migrants enter the UK, under plans being drawn up by Home Secretary Priti Patel.\n\nMs Patel has argued with Chancellor Sajid Javid that a proportion of the \u00a314.5 billion which Britain hands out in overseas aid every year should instead go to teams trying to combat organised crime networks sending migrants across the Channel in small boats.\n\nThe move by Ms Patel \u2013 a former International Development Secretary herself \u2013 follows growing calls for the bloated aid budget to be channelled more directly towards the British national interest, amid a number of high-profile expos\u00e9s of waste and mismanagement.\n\nBritish immigration officials are now working with French counterparts in Calais and Dunkirk to break up the migrant networks and have told Ms Patel that they need an injection of funding and manpower to deal with the increasing sophistication of the operations.\n\nDANGER: Border Force officers pick up migrants in the Channel last month. Border Force staff have reported that the camps where migrants wait before attempting to reach the UK have become increasingly complex mini-towns\n\nBorder Force staff have reported that the camps where migrants wait before attempting to reach the UK have become increasingly complex mini-towns, with barbers, waiter-service restaurants and even Amazon deliveries.\n\nLast month the Border Force intercepted the highest number of migrants trying to reach the UK in a single day, with 86 people attempting the journey in small boats. Gangs are now co-ordinating their actions in France to send \u2018surges\u2019 of small boats across the Channel in an effort to outmanoeuvre patrol boats.\n\nThe UK\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA), which is in charge of moves to thwart the operations through its Invigor task force, says smugglers wait until there is \u2018pent-up demand\u2019 from migrants before orchestrating \u2018mass departures\u2019 in the knowledge that not all of the boats will be stopped. Last year more than 1,300 migrants used the dangerous shipping lane to reach Britain.\n\nFollowing a crackdown on the supply of boats to northern France, the NCA says dinghies are being bought from as far away as Germany.\n\nAfter the teams cleared a migrant camp containing about 1,000 people in Dunkirk last month, they told how gang leaders use phones with \u2018self-destruct\u2019 buttons which erase evidence about migration routes.\n\nWhen Ms Patel was International Development Secretary, she protested about the way much of the aid budget was spent. Critics say the pressure to spend it leads to waste and corruption.\n\nA source close to Ms Patel said: \u2018It is in the interests of the migrants and the UK that these crossings are stopped. Some of these migrants are being loaded into tiny boats at gunpoint after handing over their life savings to criminal gangs and are in severe danger of losing their lives on the treacherous crossing.\n\n\u2018The public are deeply sceptical of aid spending, which is hardly surprising given some of the farcical projects that have been in the papers in recent years. It would be much better to spend some of that money tackling small boat crossings.\u2019\n\nHARRY COLE: 'Wizard of Oz' Australian election king Sir Lynton Crosby has lost his magic for Boris Johnson as he loses out on running General Election campaign\n\nAustralian election king Sir Lynton Crosby and his sidekick Mark Fullbrook may have masterminded Boris Johnson\u2019s successful bids for City Hall and helped to put him in No 10, but I hear they will not be running his General Election campaign.\n\nThe architect of David Cameron\u2019s unexpected 2015 majority, Crosby \u2013 nicknamed the \u2018Wizard of Oz\u2019 \u2013 was retained by Conservative HQ for Theresa May\u2019s 2017 campaign, but relations soured after bitter recriminations about the result.\n\nFullbrook also sparked internal ire for his poor running of Zac Goldsmith\u2019s attempt to replace Johnson as Mayor of London.\n\nCrosby kept up a close relationship with the future PM, and his firm continues to provide polling for the party. But despite Crosby being on \u2018speed dial\u2019 to Johnson during his successful leadership campaign, which was managed by Fullbrook, relations with the one-time gurus have \u2018distinctly cooled\u2019 after a series of negative briefings about the PM\u2019s new team found their way into the tabloids.\n\nA source whispers: \u2018Lots of people seem to be struggling to come to terms with the new regime and are lashing out, looking for people to blame.\u2019\n\nOfficially, it\u2019s all sweetness and light, but senior Tories confirm neither man will play \u2018a leading role\u2019 in the coming campaign.\n\nOlly well done, old boy!\n\nChampagne all round at the National Liberal Club, the ornate Thames-side private members\u2019 townhouse beloved by well-heeled Liberal Democrats.\n\nMy spy snapped this congratulations on the club noticeboard to newly honoured Sir Oliver Robbins \u2013 Theresa May\u2019s controversial pro- EU Brexit negotiator, loathed and distrusted by Leavers and made a knight after quitting in failure.\n\nThe Government\u2019s loss is Goldman Sachs\u2019 gain...\n\nChampagne all round at the National Liberal Club, the ornate Thames-side private members\u2019 townhouse beloved by well-heeled Liberal Democrats\n\nIs Jo planning to score at Twickers?\n\nI hear private polling numbers in Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson\u2019s East Dunbartonshire seat are dire, with party insiders hinting she could perform a \u2018chicken run\u2019 to Twickenham to avoid a humiliating defeat to the SNP.\n\nHowever, the Libs have already selected a candidate to replace the retiring Sir Vince Cable.\n\nGiven the south-west London seat is a jewel in their crown, having been yellow for all but two years since 1997, there was some surprise when relative unknown Munira Wilson was selected for the plum constituency.\n\nThe party denies she is just keeping the seat warm, but it\u2019s one to watch...\n\n\u2018Saudi Arabia should be held to account, not embraced,\u2019 said Jeremy Corbyn in one of his regular tirades against the Government\u2019s ties to the controversial Gulf kingdom.\n\nSo the Labour leader may wish to have a quiet word with his MP Imran Hussain, who last week declared a luxury junket there including \u2018flights, internal travel, accommodation, food and documentation\u2019.\n\nThe Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia picked up the whopping \u00a320,000 bill for him and a guest less than ten months after the brutal murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi horrified the world.\n\nSecurity guards were startled by the Prime Minister loudly yelling \u2018No Deal\u2019 in the Downing Street garden very early in the morning.\n\nRather than rehearsing bellicose threats for next week\u2019s crunch EU Brexit showdown, Boris assured those concerned who had run to the scene that he was trying to get his puppy Dilyn, now known as \u2018Dil\u2019, to behave.\n\nWestminster's self-appointed Head Girl, Amber Rudd, stepped up her ongoing war on violent political rhetoric last week, accusing Downing Street of sounding \u2018angry and desperate\u2019 with words \u2018that I do not believe should be the language of a UK Government\u2019.\n\nRegular readers will remember her own rather aggressive resignation letter last month.\n\nBut now I hear the version that made it on to the Prime Minister\u2019s desk was actually toned down.\n\nThe original draft passed to me talked of \u2018reckless political arson\u2019, \u2018wanton culling\u2019 and Rudd refusing to be \u2018an innocent bystander any longer while our party is vandalised\u2019. Angry and desperate?\n\nWhatever could the Brexit Party\u2019s Ann Widdecombe have meant with her astonishing blast at fellow female Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom and her choice of \u2018awful\u2019 clothes?\n\n\u2018That micro skirt and plunging neckline,\u2019 she raged at the Business Secretary last week. \u2018I won\u2019t say what I thought you looked like because it really would not be terribly polite.\u2019\n\nSurely the devout Catholic is not suggesting that yet another Tory Cabinet Minister has \u2018something of the night\u2019 about them?", "description": "The policy - which is to form part of the new Immigration Bill to be unveiled in tomorrow's Queen's Speech - is designed to attract skilled workers to less prosperous parts of the country.", "authors": ["Glen Owen Political Editor For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/21/19636296-0-image-a-15_1570913419122.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
