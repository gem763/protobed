The piece was composed by world famous composer and conductor Krzysztof Penderecki. [KWON HYUK-JAE]\n\nPolish composer and conductor Krzysztof Penderecki. [OPUS]\n\nPolish composer and conductor Krzysztof Penderecki, 86, began to make a name for himself with the release of \u201cThrenody to the Victims of Hiroshima,\u201d also known as \u201cThrenody\u201d in 1960.The musician worked on the piece in honor of those who perished from the dropping of a nuclear bomb by the United States on the city in southwestern Japan during World War II. Upon its release, the piece, which lasts just less than nine minutes, stirred the musical world.Lacking conventional musical elements such as melodies and forms, \u201cThrenody\u201d is a jumble of discordant sounds. It presents buzzing, rattling and scratchy sounds from 52 string instruments. The music evokes pain at some point as listeners hear a sound that is similar to fingernails scraping across a chalkboard.\u201cThrenody\u201d itself is innovative in terms of its style and it brought instant stardom to Penderecki, adding his name to a page in 20th century music history.Over his career, the maestro has taken home five Grammy awards, two Emmy awards and a Grawemeyer Award, and is now scheduled to conduct another historical piece, \u201cSaint Luke Passion,\u201d in Seoul this month.Penderecki composed \u201cSaint Luke Passion\u201d in 1966. The music reflects historical events, such as the massacre of civilians carried out by the Nazis and political conflict within Poland after World War II.\u201cSaint Luke Passion\u201d opened the renowned Salzburg Festival last year and it will be performed for the first time in Seoul by Penderecki as part of the Seoul International Music Festival (SIMF). SIMF runs through Nov. 8 across the capital city.\u201cSaint Luke Passion,\u201d a two-hour-long musical piece, will be performed at the Seoul Arts Center, located in Seocho-dong, southern Seoul, on Oct. 26. The show starts at 5 p.m.Apart from \u201cThrenody\u201d and \u201cSaint Luke Passion,\u201d Penderecki has written numerous historical pieces, including Symphony No. 5, which was written especially for Korea - the subtitle of the piece is \u201cKorea.\u201dIt was requested by scholar and the former Culture Minister Lee O-young, 85, in 1991 and it was performed here a year later.Lee now leads the Northeast Asia Institute of Comparative Cultural Studies.Lee calls Penderecki \u201ca humanist, as well as an artist with a warm heart.\u201d Lee added that he wanted Symphony No. 5 to be \u201ca song that can comfort the souls of the nameless, deceased people.\u201dLee, the influential critic, novelist and scholar, talked about his special relationship with Penderecki during a recent interview with the JoongAng Ilbo, an affiliate of the Korea JoongAng Daily.The following are edited excerpts from the conversation.A. I used to tell people that we have to find non-political or economic solutions for the reunification of the country when I was serving as the culture minister. The collective memory we share as a whole before the country became divided is important to us. The South and the North have a shared history of about 500 to 600 years, well beyond the total number of years the two countries have been divided. We need to check on the shared culture of the two countries and see where the harsh feelings come from. I believe we need to let go of the bad feelings. Of all the memories we have in common, music plays an important role.I thought there should be no words for the song. [Different characteristics of languages used in the two Koreas] may bring clashes in ideologies. The song had to come from a third country that is neither South Korea nor North Korea.Many people died during the Japanese colonial period. They died while they were fighting for the independence of the country and they were falsely accused of being rioters. These people do not even have tombstones. I needed a song that could comfort them. With the song, I dreamed of commemorating Independence Day together with the North.We have some rituals that soothe the soul of the dead such as sitgimgut, which is a shamanist act of cleaning the soul of the deceased, but there are not many songs for those people. First I started listening to requiems and then I listened to \u201cThrenody,\u201d which was recommended by some people I know.Poland, where Penderecki is from, and Eastern Europe were attacked by Russia. I just wanted to tell him that as a musician he should write a song not only for Japan, which is responsible for colonizing Korea, but also for Korea. I asked him to write a requiem for us. I wanted to remember people who passed away with their eyes open on nameless battlefields. If a world famous musician like him writes a song for the victims of Korea, I thought our story could spread out further.I invited Penderecki to Korea and we ate Korean food together and I officially asked him to write a song for us. I gave him a couple of cassette tapes so that he could listen to some traditional Korean songs. Instead of listening to the tapes, he headed for the Namdaemun Market and he got inspiration from all the people packed in the market, the colors and the vibe that filled the market on that day.[Soon after making a request for the song,] I stepped down from the culture minister job and had to go here and there, so I couldn\u2019t even watch the premiere. There was a lot of talk about asking a non-Korean composer to write the song. But the idea [for the project] was ours, so the music is ours, too. There is this anecdote about Alexander the Great wailing in front of the tomb of Achilles after he conquered the whole world. His subordinates asked him what made him cry so hard, and Alexander said, \u201cAchilles is known as a hero across the world, but he couldn\u2019t even attack and destroy the castle of Troy. But he had Homer, who spread the heroic acts of Achilles. I conquered Europe, but I don\u2019t have Homer and there is no way for me to share my saga.\u201d Korea needs a Homer. If we can\u2019t afford to share our story by ourselves, we can ask for help from influential artists from other countries.I want to ask him to work on \u201cCheongsanbyeolgok,\u201d which is a beautiful song. In the song, the lyrics say that they will eat meoru [Korean berries] and darae [Siberian gooseberry]. It means they will go back from an agricultural society to becoming hunter-gatherers. Meoru and darae stand opposite to rice and barely and the lyrics say that they would go to cheongsan [blue mountain] and they will live on meoru and darae given to them by God. We have to live like hunters and gatherers, but we now grapple with lower-back pain, rheumatism and obesity after going through industrialization. If the song is remade by a world-famous musician, I bet it would become a song that could be enjoyed by the whole world.BY KIM HO-JOUNG [estyle@joongang.co.kr]\ud3f4\ub780\ub4dc \uc791\uace1\uac00
