Automatically share your work by snapping a picture \u2014 then wipe it clean and start again. Photo: Courtesy of the retailer\n\nI\u2019m a professional gadget person, but there are times when I prefer the lo-fi. I like to hold a book in my hands and feel the turn of the pages. I have a soft spot for film cameras. And when it comes to taking notes, I much prefer pen and paper over a note typed into my phone. Problem is, I also tend to misplace papers, and all those notebooks and journals pile up over time. So when a colleague turned me on this summer to the Rocketbook Everlast \u2014 i.e., the coolest notebook I\u2019d ever seen \u2014 I knew it was the last one I\u2019d ever need.\n\nIt\u2019s called the Everlast because, of course, it\u2019s reusable forever. The pages feel like paper, but they\u2019re made of a polyester composite that\u2019s fully erasable with a damp cloth when you write on it with the right kind of ink (Pilot FriXions are what Rocketbook suggests). Scrawl notes as you usually do, and once you\u2019re done, wipe them off and start over \u2014 ad infinitum. (Rocketbook makes a notebook that you can erase five times via the microwave, but this is so much better.)\n\nBefore you erase your work, the Everlast has something of a digital filing system, too. Each page of the notebook has its own unique QR code \u2014 snap a photo with the Everlast app on your phone and it\u2019ll keep track of what was written on what page (in case you\u2019re scrambling to find what the boss said on Wednesday morning). At the bottom of each notebook page, there are also seven different icons \u2014 a diamond, a bell, a star, etc. \u2014 that you can preassign to specific destinations via the app, like a folder on your Google Drive (think \u201cSuper Long Love Letter\u201d or \u201cGreat American Novel Ideas\u201d), or a Dropbox or email account, and so on. Once you\u2019ve finished scribbling on a page, cross an X on the appropriate icon, snap an image, and off goes a PDF or JPG to your chosen destination. So, yes, it\u2019s your typical notebook, with all the pleasures of analogue note-taking \u2014 only it\u2019s usable forever and works as a digital document backup system. It does everything I want, in other words, only better.\n\nMore Strat-approved notebooks\n\nPrinceton Architectural Press Grids & Guides: A Notebook for Visual Thinkers \u00a312 (was \u00a314, now 14% off) Writer Molly Young discovered a notebook unlike any other: \u201cEach of the 144 pages is printed with a variable grid design. This pattern is simultaneously a constraint (because grid) and a mild creative prompt (because variable). You progress through the notebook not knowing which grid design will greet you on the next page. Will it be the gray lines? The blue boxes? The tessellated triangles? The evenly spaced dots? The grids are all bold enough to provide structure but faint enough to foreground your writing.\u201d \u00a312 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nLeuchtturm1917 Medium Size Hardcover A5 Notebook Little Fires Everywhere author Celeste Ng can\u2019t travel without her Leuchtturm: \u201cI keep a writer\u2019s notebook and also put all my daily schedules and to-do lists in it. Leuchtturms are my favorites \u2014 they come in beautiful colors, have page numbers, and are just the right size to fit in my purse. I prefer the dotted pages, because they\u2019re helpful when I need straight lines and easy to ignore when I don\u2019t. Compared to a Moleskine, the paper is thicker, there are two ribbon bookmarks, and they come with stickers for labeling and archiving afterward (nerd bonus).\u201d \u00a313 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
