Several sources stated that a contracting firm working for Google named Randstad sent teams to Atlanta explicitly to target homeless people and individuals with dark skin.\n\nOne source told the Daily News that although Google did not essentially know that homeless people were being targeted, they did instruct contractors to seek out individuals with \u201cdarker skin tones.\u201d One former staffer stated: \u201cThey said to target homeless people because they\u2019re the least likely to say anything to the media. The homeless people didn\u2019t know what was going on at all.\u201d\n\nContractors were reportedly told to characterize the facial scanning process as a \u201cselfie game\u201d similar to Snapchat. One contractor stated that they were told to tell people to \u201cJust play with the phone for a couple minutes and get a gift card,\u201d and, \u201cWe have a new app, try it and get $5.\u201d Contractors were also reportedly told to entice people to take part by telling them of a California state law which says that gift cards valued at less than $10 can be exchanged for cash.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
