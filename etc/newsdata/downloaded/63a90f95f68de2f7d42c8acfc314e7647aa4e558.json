It creates a sense of space but also enables local people in that region to participate in the airport commercial space.\u201d\n\nAnd this rethinking is especially visible in the changes at King Shaka.\n\nThe domestic departures terminal has seen a revamp where its commercial spaces have been moved to the centre, ideally positioned so that passengers walk through the shops to get to their gates.\n\nThe Spur restaurant has been renovated to include new facilities like USB charge ports for cellphones at tables and a bottomless cold drink station for those with long waits.\n\nALSO SEE: King Shaka hits record 5.5m passengers as direct Durban-London route plans continue\n\nThe airport itself also promotes its retail spaces on its social media pages, advertising deals so that passengers already know what\u2019s on offer before they even reach the airport.\n\n\u201cThe layout of retail is moving away from some shop stuck in a dingy corner \u2013 which is how we used to plan the flow of airports \u2013 but now planning happens with commercial at the forefront. So when you\u2019re planning terminals and airports, you consider how your retail will be laid out with bright, open spaces that allow passengers to be attracted to the shops.\u201d\n\nBut the process is very calculated \u2013 Delamoney adds that all of this is underpinned by serious market research.\n\n\u201cOften airports in the past tried to think for their passengers and stakeholders as to what would be best for them, but more and more it\u2019s about what they actually want through surveys.\u201d\n\nWATCH: A sneak-peek at Emirates' luxe First Class suite coming to Durban\n\nAnd the retail spaces are also taking on the unique opportunities that having an airport space can provide.\n\nLast year, King Shaka\u2019s Sunglass Hut kiosk offered travellers on their way to the fashionable Durban July the chance to lease their expensive glasses for the weekend, and offering discounts if they end up buying the glasses in the end.\n\nWhere in a normal mall would you ever find this kind of deal?\n\nFind Your Escape by searching and comparing flight prices here.
