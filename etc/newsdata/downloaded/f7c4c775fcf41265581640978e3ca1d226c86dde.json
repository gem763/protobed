Both are crimes under Morocco\u2019s penal code, and she faces up to two years in jail; her doctor also faces jail time. Ms. Raissouni\u2019s defense maintains that there was no abortion and that the medical reports presented by the prosecution are false.\n\nWhat\u2019s surprising about this arrest is that even though abortions are illegal in Morocco, they are quite common \u2014 and rarely prosecuted. A nongovernmental organization that wants to raise awareness about the risks of clandestine abortions in the country estimates that between 600 and 800 abortions take place every day. There were 73 prosecutions last year.\n\nMs. Raissouni\u2019s unexpected arrest suggests she was targeted because of her profession and her relations. And it shows how vulnerable everyone is when morality is policed arbitrarily by an autocratic state, which can choose to expose the \u201cindecency\u201d of some people\u2019s lives but not others. Those targeted will always tend to be the most powerless, or the most troublesome to the authorities.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ursula Lindsey", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Hajar-Raissouni-Arrest.Html"], "top_image": ""}
