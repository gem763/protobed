The two shared a brief romance before reportedly ending things two weeks ago.\n\nFans hope to hear Cyrus' new music soon.\n\nIn the meantime, she also dropped \"Don't Call Me Angel\" last month alongside Ariana Grande for the new \"Charlie's Angels\" film.", "description": "Looks like Miley Cyrus is working on new music.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/miley-cyrus-gty-ml-191003_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
