The plant would remain closed, Motsoaledi said on Monday.\n\nPreliminary results also showed that several ready-to-eat processed meat products from the Enterprise facility located in Germiston contained listeria monocytogenes.\n\nAn investigation of the Rainbow Chicken Wolwehoek production facility was also done after polony products tested positive for listeria monocytogenes, but they were not the ST6 strain.\n\nProducts from these facilities were also recalled.\n\nThree more people died shortly after the announcement, one a baby younger than one month.\n\nMotsoaledi said on Monday that 5 812 tons of ready-to-eat processed meat had been recalled and that the total cost of containing the outbreak had come to R12m.\n\n\"No cases of listeria, due to the outbreak strain, have been identified since the first week of June 2018,\" the minister said.\n\n\"Therefore, the conclusion is that the outbreak of listeriosis in South Africa is over. I'm here to announce to you officially that we no longer have a listeria outbreak in South Africa.\"\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, this outbreak was the largest recorded globally to date.", "description": "The deadly listeriosis outbreak that killed more than 180 South Africans is finally a thing of the past, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has announced.
