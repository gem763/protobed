USA TODAY\n\nCalifornia has adopted one of the nation\u2019s strictest laws regulating police use of force, hoping it will deter shootings by law enforcement agents.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom on Monday signed Assembly Bill 392, which changes the standard for police officers\u2019 justified use of deadly force from instances when it\u2019s \u201creasonable\u2019\u2019 to when it\u2019s \u201cnecessary.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe law redefines when police can resort to deadly force \u201cbased on the totality of the circumstances\u2019\u2019 and encourages the use of de-escalation techniques and crisis-intervention methods.\n\n\u201cWe are doing something today that stretches the boundary of possibility and sends a message to people all across this country that they can do more and they can do better to meet this moment,\u201d Newsom said as he stood alongside family members of people killed by police.\n\nFiring back: NYPD union outraged as Officer Daniel Pantaleo is fired in Eric Garner death\n\nModifications to the previous law, advocated by activist groups like Black Lives Matter, were prompted by officer-involved shootings such as the March 2018 killing of Stephon Clark, an unarmed black man gunned down outside his grandparents\u2019 house in the state capital of Sacramento when police mistook his cellphone for a firearm.\n\nNewsom said the new law will reduce the number of lives lost and begin to heal communities.\n\nThe measure by Democratic Assemblywoman Shirley Weber of San Diego, which initially met fierce resistance from law enforcement organizations, made it through the state Legislature with bipartisan support after it was amended to address police concerns.\n\nThe police killing of Stephon Clark in March 2018 sparked protests in Sacramento, California, and elsewhere as activists demanded a higher level of accountability from law enforcement officers.

Garner\u2019s repeated cries of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u2019\u2019 as he gasped for air became a rallying cry in the movement against police brutality.\n\nSimilarly, Clark\u2019s death at 22 precipitated major protests and demands for changes and a higher level of police accountability. The officers who shot him were ruled to have acted lawfully and were not disciplined.\n\n'Emotional roller coaster': After decision not to charge cops in Stephon Clark shooting, Sacramento tries to heal\n\nJoy Johnson, a pastor who leads a faith-based advocacy organization in Sacramento, was among those who commemorated the anniversary of Clark\u2019s death in March while pushing for a legal change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to raise the public\u2019s consciousness to see that, if you say you followed the law to the letter and the law says it\u2019s justifiable to take the life of an unarmed person, then we believe the law needs reexamining,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nOn Monday, the law\u2019s reexamination resulted in a significant change.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/08/19/police-shootings-new-california-law-raises-standard-use-force/2054368001/", "description": "California OKs law to raise standard for police use of deadly force, hoping to deter officer-involved shootings like the one that killed Stephon Clark.", "authors": ["Jorge L.
