Reminder: There are 144 days until the Iowa caucuses and 418 days until the 2020 election.\n\nTonight, much will be made of the fact that Joe Biden, the longtime Democratic frontrunner, and Elizabeth Warren, his closest challenger in the polls, are meeting for the first time on the primary debate stage.\n\nBut a lot of people forget: This isn\u2019t the first time they\u2019ve debated.\n\nFor a preview of what might occur in Houston \u2014 Will Biden punch down at Warren? Will Warren try to topple Biden? What lines of attack will they use? \u2014 it\u2019s worth reviewing how they faced each other back in 2005.\n\nFrom the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, Warren, then a law professor at Harvard, shuttled back and forth between Cambridge, Mass., and Washington, D.C., as a combatant in what she later called the \u201cbankruptcy wars.\u201d At stake was legislation that sought to address a dramatic rise in bankruptcy filings by making it harder for individuals to discharge their debts through bankruptcy, a goal that credit card companies had championed for years.\n\nIn her research, Warren found that the explosion of bankruptcy filings \u2014 more than a million families a year by the mid-90s \u2014 wasn\u2019t being driven by reckless consumers seeking to escape their credit card balances. Instead it was the result of a fraying social safety net and a precipitous decline in the economic security of the American middle class.\n\nSo Warren opposed the bill. Her chief Democratic antagonist was Sen. Joe Biden, who represented Delaware, where the financial industry exercised enormous influence. Starting during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency and continuing well into the George W. Bush years, Biden fought as hard for the bankruptcy crackdown as Warren fought against it.\n\nThey finally met face-to-face on Feb. 10, 2005. Warren was the expert witness; Biden was the interrogator. In her books and op-eds, Warren had already criticized Biden for the bill\u2019s disproportionate impact on women. But there, in the Hart Senate Office Building, their mutual animosity spilled out into the open.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s call a spade a spade,\u201d Biden snapped after Warren cited the example of a woman who had borrowed $2,200 at high interest rates and after paying back $2,100 actually owed $2,600 at the time of her bankruptcy. \u201cYour problem with credit card companies is usury rates from your position. It is not about the bankruptcy bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, senator,\u201d Warren replied, \u201cif you are not going to fix that problem, you can\u2019t take away the last shred of protection from these families.\u201d\n\nBiden grinned. \u201cI got it,\u201d he said sarcastically. \u201cOK. You are very good, professor.\u201d\n\nBiden eventually prevailed. His bill passed later that year. But the fundamental difference between him and Warren on vivid display in 2005 is the same disagreement that divides them today. Biden believed then, as he believes now, that the best way a politician can help the middle class is by being \u201cpragmatic,\u201d as he told Yahoo News Senior Political Correspondent Jon Ward while contrasting his approach with Warren\u2019s in a 2015 interview \u2014 by brokering \u201ccommon sense\u201d compromises that advance the ball a few yards at a time. Warren\u2019s view, on the other hand, is that incrementalists like Biden have done little to protect working Americans from sweeping shifts in the American economy \u2014 and the only way to really fight back is with \u201cbig, structural\u201d reforms.\n\nWhatever specific policy disagreements they might have tonight, the subtext will probably be some variation of that clash: Biden accusing Warren of thinking too big, and Warren protesting that Biden is thinking too small.\n\n\u201cThe more expensive a plan is doesn\u2019t make it more progressive,\u201d a Biden adviser told CNN Tuesday. \u201cRunning for president is about making people\u2019s lives better, and that only happens if the change proposed becomes reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can't choose a candidate we don't believe in because we are scared,\u201d Warren said last weekend in New Hampshire. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t ask other people to vote for someone we don\u2019t believe in.\u201d\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "For a preview of what might occur in Houston \u2014 Will Biden punch down at Warren?
