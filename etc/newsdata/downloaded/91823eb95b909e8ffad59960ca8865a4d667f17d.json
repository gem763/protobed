In fact, investor sentiment was so bearish (this chart shows it) that I said the following in the Sept. 4 Profit Radar Report:\n\n\u201cRange racing continues. The longer it lasts, the more people know about it, and the more people know about it, the higher the odds of a false breakout. In fact, a fake-out breakout would burn a lot of premature bears and may be just what is needed to clear the air for another leg lower.\u201d\n\nZero to hero\n\nLast month\u2019s zero morphed into this week\u2019s hero. The Russell 2000 RUT, +0.32% popped 8.8% after sitting at a six-month low just a couple weeks ago. No doubt, this rally burned a lot of bears, and it may continue to do so. How come?\n\nFrom Sept. 9-11, the Russell 2000 recorded three consecutive daily gains of more than 1% each, a rare feat.\n\nComing shortly after a six-month low, this has only happened eight other times in the 21st century. Seven of eight times the index was higher a year later, by 17% on average.\n\nThe green arrows in the chart, below, highlight the last four times this happened: January 2019, February 2016, October 2014 and October 2011.\n\nAside from the October 2014 low, this reads like a who\u2019s who of market bottoms.\n\nThe February 2016 instance was also matched by the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.05%, and prompted me to make this bold (and highly ridiculed) forecast: \u201cHistorical pattern says the risk of a 2016 bear market is zero.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cbreadth thrust\u201d track record speaks for itself. Nevertheless, I\u2019ve learned to examine the merit of each signal. Here are two key questions:\n\n1. Is it time to buy small-cap stocks?\n\n2. Will small-caps buoy other indexes including the S&P 500, Dow Jones DJIA, +0.20% and Nasdaq COMP, -0.18% ?\n\nLet\u2019s break down those questions.\n\nFor question No. 1: Yes for the long term. Still, a lower entry price is possible in the short term.\n\nBased on my composite of indicators, there is little reason to doubt the long-term validity of the signal.\n\nThe daily chart of the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, +0.44%, below, shows why a short-term pullback is possible:\n\nPrice has not yet broken out and is at double resistance.\n\nRSI-2, a measure of short-term momentum, is over-bought (short-term risk is elevated).\n\nRSI-35, a measure of longer-term momentum, has not yet broken out.\n\nA retest of the 150-151 zone would be normal. A close below 150 would postpone the rally and allow for a deeper pullback.\n\nFor question No. 2: It\u2019s often said that small-caps are more economically sensitive and therefore a leading indicator. In theory this sounds good, but in reality that\u2019s not really the case.\n\nAlthough the Russell 2000 was first to peel away from its August 2018 top (and has been lagging ever since), the S&P 500 has reached a new high first more often than the Russell 2000 (see chart below).\n\nConclusion\n\nReaders may remember my mid-term bearish projection published here, and the Russell 2000 breadth thrust certainly does not support this forecast.\n\nIn fact, starting in mid-August, I noticed a number of bullish \u201cunder the hood\u201d developments likely to cause a bounce and warned that: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen bounces catch fire before, and aggressive investors afraid of missing out may grab some long exposure.\u201d\n\nThe Russell 2000 sure caught fire, and history suggests it will continue to burn higher over the next year. The over-bought condition and bearish September/October seasonality should, however, provide a lower buy point.\n\nSimon Maierhofer is the founder of iSPYETF and publisher of the Profit Radar Report.", "description": "Technical indicators suggest prices will rise over the next year.", "authors": ["Simon Maierhofer"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GK982_rocket_MG_20180615095543.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
