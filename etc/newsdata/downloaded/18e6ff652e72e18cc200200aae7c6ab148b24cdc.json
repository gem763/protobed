NBA record 602 3-point makes during first three seasons in the league. Over $450,000 raised to aid storm destroyed Bahamas.\n\nBuddy Hield is having a crazy year. He's become a budding star on the court, set record with his perimeter shooting and stepped up to the challenge after Hurricane Dorian ravaged his homeland.\n\nTo his growing list of accomplishments, Hield can now add something new.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNBA teams were notified this week that they must certify and submit the precise height and age for every player within the first week of training camp, league sources tell @NYTSports \u2014 Marc Stein (@TheSteinLine) September 26, 2019\n\nAccording to Stein, \"Among the motivations for this new policy, sources say, is the fact that Buddy Hield's age was found to be recorded incorrectly in 2018.\"\n\nHield skipped a year in age when he revealed on the NBC Sports California broadcast that he turned 26 on Dec. 17 and not 25, as previously listed.\n\nIt wasn't anything nefarious. Just a mix up on data entry according to Hield. 1992 is his listed birth year on all of his identification, including his Bahamian passport.\n\n\"I came over with a passport,\" Hield told NBC Sports Bay Area back in December with the news first broke. \"My passport has 1992 on it. My driver's license has 1992 on it. I just think people got their information from Wikipedia or wherever, and they just went with it. They just got it wrong.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's unlikely that the league will get much older over the next week, but it's certainly going to shrink a bit. There might be another player or two with birth year issues, but the NBA is usually thorough in this process.\n\nHield's issues seems to be an anomaly, although we'll learn more on this over the coming weeks.\n\nExpanded heights have been an issue around the NBA for some time. Most players are measured as part of the combine, but not everyone gets an invitation or shows up for the measurement portion.\n\nPlayers heights are listed both with and without shoes on the NBA's anthrometric site. According to Stein, all players will be measured without shoes in the new certification process.\n\nIt's an interesting decision by the league that will likely open up plenty of players to scrutiny or at least internet memes.\n\nIs Yogi Ferrell really 6-foot tall? Do you measure Marvin Bagley's height with or without the hair? Does Bogdan Bogdanovic get a special \u2018metric system' exemption?\n\nWhat we know for sure, it's all Buddy Hield's fault. If he doesn't show up and measure at 6-foot-3.75, someone has some explaining to do.\n\nBlame Buddy, NBA to certify players age and height during training camp originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "NBA moves to certify age and height of players during upcoming training camp.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/i0ZxrW86NBM0HhuFriY66g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02OTguNjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0iHXvC885YUaX7DCSv5EIw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTk4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/d7fafc1efd8a3061a773197bb0ee0615", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
