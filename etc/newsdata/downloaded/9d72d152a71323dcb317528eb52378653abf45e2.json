Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s far-right president, is a longstanding critic of Venezuela\u2019s embattled leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and has close relations with rightwing Venezuelan groups seeking his overthrow.\n\nEarlier this week, Bolsonaro dismissed speculation that the spill had been released by a sinking ship. \u201cIf it was a shipwreck, oil would still be coming up. It is more probable that something was dumped there criminally,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nBolsonaro said he did not want to blame another country without proof, but hinted darkly: \u201cWe have a country on our radar screen that could be the origin of the oil.\u201d\n\nPetrobras\u2019s chief executive, Roberto Castello, said on Tuesday that the amount of oil spilled so far \u2013 approximately 500 barrels \u2013 was far too much to have been from the result of a routine tank cleaning.\n\nSocial media users have shared shocking images of the spill, showing kilometers of white sand stained with oil blotches and dead, oil-covered turtles and dolphins. One video shows thick black oil lapping up against a rocky jetty.\n\nThe oil\u2019s appearance came shortly after Brazil became the focus of international criticism over record wildfires and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest \u2013 both of which have surged since Bolsonaro came to office.\n\nEnvironmentalists and indigenous leaders say that Bolsonaro\u2019s stripping back of environmental legislation and protections has stoked a fresh assault on the country\u2019s ecosystems.\n\n\u201cThe oil spill that\u2019s reached over 132 beaches in the north-east is criminal. Removing the residue from the ocean can take 10 to 20 years,\u201d said the former environment minister Marina Silva in a tweet. \u201cThis is a warning that we need to strengthen and not suffocate the environmental monitoring institutions in the country.\u201d", "description": "Government says foreign ship appears to have caused the spill, in accusation likely to further strain Brazilian-Venezuelan relations", "authors": ["Anna Jean Kaiser"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6a085294c01236be332ac1c2e433803725f973e/0_36_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ac9651dc54f07c324e9bd9d0cad55322", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
