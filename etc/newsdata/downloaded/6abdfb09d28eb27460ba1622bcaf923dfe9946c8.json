The modern opera house was commissioned for the bicentennial of the French Revolution. The theatre attracts one of its youngest audiences.\n\nThe Bastille is a theatre of today; a modern theatre which has made drawing vast - and varied - audiences its mission.\n\nWhen the curtains rose for the first time at the Opera Bastille, it unveiled a colossal work: 'Les Troyens' by Hector Berlioz. The celebrated Russian director Dmitri Tcherniakov is reimagining the play in a new production to mark the anniversary. Tcherniakov spoke to Euronews.\n\n\"Hector Berlioz is a very visual composer, very colourful. On stage, he tells you a story in detail. It's a huge palette of colours.\"\n\nIn the five-act epic, the French composer retells the exploits of Aeneas. American tenor Brandon Jovanovich sings the reinterpretation.\n\n\"The opera consists of two parts with different themes. 'The Sacking of Troy' and 'The Trojans in Carthage'. I tried to unite the story with only one common point - one character - Aeneas.\" He said \u201cThis is a personal story about what\u2019s happening to him. And we found a lot of different sides of his character, some which aren\u2019t clear on the first impression.\"\n\nDmitri Tcherniakov is among the most experimental thinkers in the Opera world. Jovanovich refers to the second part of the opera which is set in a post-traumatic stress clinic.\n\n\"He (Tcherniakov) has taken it more into an emotional state where he sees the struggle within these characters.\"\n\nTcherniakov insists that he wants his stage work to be challenging.\n\n\"The most difficult task is the one I\u2019m more interested in it. I don\u2019t want to do something that is too easy to understand. I like to work on challenging stories, ones that rouse my courage and curiosity.\"\n\nThe Paris Opera\u2019s General director Stephane Lissner is happy to continue inviting stage directors that those surprise audiences\n\n\u2018An opera house which is a theatre of vibrant performances has to be open to debate. For me, it's important to be able to invite stage directors who have a scenographic perspective of the piece and who offer ideas that might sometimes throw the audience off guard and surprise them.\u201d\n\n'Les Troyens' premieres on January 25th. Performances run through to February 12.", "description": "Russian director Dmitri Tcherniakov reimagines 'Les Troyens'", "authors": ["Katharina Rabillon"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/58/78/70/1000x563_cmsv2_63daff02-cabb-5927-9670-25b8ee9160be-3587870.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-24"}
