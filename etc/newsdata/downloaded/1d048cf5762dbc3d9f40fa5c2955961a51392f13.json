Near Houston, houses that flooded only two years ago just succumbed again. The South endured record-shattering fall heat waves. In Miami, salt water bubbled through street drains yet again as the rising ocean mounted a fresh assault.\n\nAll of it was predicted, in general outline, decades ago. We did not listen. Ideologues and paid shills cajoled us to ignore the warnings. Politicians cashed their checks from the fossil fuel lobbyists and slithered away.\n\nToday, we act surprised as the climate emergency descends upon us in all its ferocity.\n\nThe scientists knew long ago, and told us, that the sea would invade the coasts. They knew a hotter atmosphere would send heavier rains to inundate our cities and farms. They knew the landscape of California, which always becomes desiccated in the late summer and early fall, would dry out more in a hotter climate.\n\nBut even the scientists did not quite foresee the way that bone-dry vegetation would turn into a firebomb waiting for a spark. California is the state that has done the most to battle the climate crisis, but that has not saved it from recent fires so ferocious they burned people alive.", "description": "The most urgent imperative now is to turn our fear and frustration into votes.", "authors": ["Justin Gillis"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/opinion/13Gillis1/13Gillis1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
