(SOL.JO) said Monday that it won't be paying a final dividend for fiscal 2019 as it reported a 45% fall in fiscal 2019 EBIT.\n\nThe South Africa-based petrochemical and energy company said it had decided not to declare the dividend to protect and strengthen its balance sheet due to the current leverage and volatility in the macroeconomic environment. However the board will consider an interim dividend for fiscal 2020. Sasol paid a final dividend of 7.90 South African Rand for fiscal 2018.\n\nSasol reported earnings before interest and tax for the year ended June 30 of 9.7 billion South African Rand ($661.5 million) compared with ZAR17.75 billion a year earlier.\n\nHeadline earnings, however, rose to ZAR18.94 billion from ZAR16.8 billion.\n\nThe company had previously delayed the release of its fiscal 2019 financial results so it could complete a review into possible board-control weaknesses at its Lake Charles chemicals project.\n\nIt said earlier Monday that the review concluded that there were shortcomings from the former leadership of the Lake Charles project, but there wasn't enough evidence to conclude that they had acted with an intent to defraud the company.\n\nIt said joint Chief Executives Bongani Nqwababa and Stephen Cornell would leave the company by mutual agreement on Oct. 31. Fleetwood Grobler, the executive vice president for chemicals, has been appointed President and CEO from Nov. 1.\n\nThe South Africa-based petrochemical and energy company's financial results for the year ended June 30 were due to be published on Aug. 19, though this was delayed until Sept. 19 and then again until Oct. 28.\n\nWrite to Ian Walker at ian.walker@wsj.com; @IanWalk40289749\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 28, 2019 02:42 ET (06:42 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
