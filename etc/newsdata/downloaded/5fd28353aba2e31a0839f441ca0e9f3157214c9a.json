The heating was miraculously restored, but just for one day.\n\nThey say, \u201cIf life gives you lemons, make lemonade,\u201d but it\u2019s too cold to drink lemonade for the people living in the Lemonarium residential compound in the capital of Russia\u2019s Republic of Bashkortostan. They say that their home, which should have been finished in 2017, is still under construction and has its central heating turned off. Now that it is October, temperatures can fall well below 0 degrees Celsius at night.\n\nThe people of Lemonarium blame local construction tycoon Valery Mansurov and his SU-10 company for the \u201chopelessness and despair\u201d they find themselves in. They say that Mansurov and \u201chis cronies\u201d brush off of any complaints, telling them, among other things:\n\nYou can write to anybody. Write even to the Pope.\n\nThe residents weren\u2019t going to give up without a fight, so they did exactly what they were told and wrote to the Vatican to Pope Francis, despite the fact that Bashkortostan is a majority Muslim republic.\n\nAn open letter to the head of the Catholic Church in both Russian and English was also posted on Russia\u2019s VK.com social network. The cheated depositors called upon the Pope to use his authority to somehow persuade the construction company to fulfil its obligations before them.\n\n\u201cWinter is coming,\u201d they wrote, referencing the \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 TV show. \u201cThe heating season has begun. Mr. Valery Mansurov even turned off the central heating in our residential apartment building. Our families, children experience hardship in such miserable conditions in cold apartments in the unfinished building.\u201d\n\nThe letter said that addressing the Pontific was \u201cthe last resort\u201d for those freezing in Lemonarium.\n\nWe urge your Holiness to advocate for our legal rights. We believe that Mr. Valery Mansurov will listen to your wisdom and enlightenment. Please pray for his humanism and good sense.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the Pope read the letter. There have been no official comments from the Vatican so far, but the residents\u2019 bold move made a splash on social media and in the press.\n\nThen an amazing thing happened. Central heating was restored at the residential compound. The people breathed a sigh of relief\u2026 but the miracle was short lived as it was switched off again the next day.\n\nSU-10 said it couldn\u2019t make the apartments warm because it has a debt with a housing and utilities company, which services the compound. It\u2019s unclear when those obligations will be settled, and the bitter story of Lemonarium is without a happy ending. Perhaps intervention from the Pope is the only thing that will be able to change that.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018It\u2019s an honor when Americans attack me,\u2019 Pope Francis jokes\n\nLike this story?
