There is one of his celebration following his memorable goal for Holland against Argentina in the quarter-finals of the 98' World Cup, the iconic moment where he covers his face in disbelief following his last-gasp goal.\n\nAmong the impressive array of items were, tickets stubs and pencil toppers from Sugar Puffs\n\nThe 50-year-old has plenty of shirts on his wall, depicting landmarks througout his career\n\nThere is also the moment he completed his hat-trick against Leicester City in the Premeir League, a moment of pure composure and skill at Filbert Street which hangs proudly in his pool room.\n\nThere are some unconventional items, too.

Sometimes it's good, but a lot of times, you don't really feel that it's the Arsenal how we know it, with the passion and a few players who make the difference.\n\nThe pair sat down together inside Bergkamp's house, talking through their time at Arsenal\n\n'It's different. It's difficult to say if it's better or worse, well better, of course, is always shown in trophies, which aren't there at the moment.\n\n'On one hand, there are so many clubs who have improved so quickly to a high level, whereas Arsenal, maybe improved, but not to that level.\n\n'It's hard, it's difficult, it hurts sometimes because you feel about Arsenal that they should do better, but I'm still hoping.'", "description": "Former Arsenal star Dennis Bergkamp has revealed the stunning haul of memorabilia that decorates his home after showing Ian Wright and his Youtube channel team around his home.", "authors": ["Harry Slavin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/12/19584186-0-image-a-18_1570791740875.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
