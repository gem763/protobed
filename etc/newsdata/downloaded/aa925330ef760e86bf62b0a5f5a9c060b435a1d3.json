The Trump administration has tried to end some of those status grants, moving the battle over them to the courts. TPS, established by Congress in 1990, is intended to protect foreign nationals in the U.S. from being returned to their home countries.\n\nThe United Nations estimates the massive hurricane, which was nearly at a standstill over the islands, left more than 70,000 homeless. The official death toll continues to skyrocket.\n\nEarlier this week, the president insisted that Bahamians will be able to get into the U.S. but need to have \"totally proper documentation.\"\n\n\"I don't want to allow people that weren't supposed to be in the Bahamas to come into the United States including some very bad people,\" the president told reporters on the White House South Lawn Tuesday.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian wreaked havoc on the Bahamas, leaving thousands homeless", "authors": ["Kathryn Watson", "Fin Gomez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/09/d37f9ab3-118e-44bd-aa60-b2478b9f0a33/thumbnail/1200x630/114e021eb0ccd8db0449ffdc7ab65998/gettyimages-1166596830.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
