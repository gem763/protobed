Unsurprisingly designated as a \u201chigh risk\u201d fixture, this Friday night game will attract no shortage of thirsty visitors to the Czech capital, hellbent on making a weekend of it in a city renowned for the cheapness of its beer and myriad other nocturnal delights. Scheduled to kick off at 8.45pm local time, when more patriotic fans will have had all day to occupy the city\u2019s Old Town Square, get liquored up and perform their traditional repertoire of ditties, it is difficult to imagine the local constabulary will be kept idle following Uefa\u2019s refusal to move the game to a more suitable day or time. While many England fans are perfectly well-behaved, anti-social behaviour of the kind seen in Amsterdam and Porto on recent excursions seems dismally inevitable. \u201cYou\u2019re part of our team, make the country proud,\u201d said Gareth Southgate, in the FA\u2019s attempt to get in front of the problem by releasing a video entitled Don\u2019t Be That Idiot. Somebody will almost certainly be that idiot and, if recent history tells us anything, they are unlikely to be alone.

Goals, you see, remain extremely hard to come by for Ireland. But a solution may have emerged: Brighton\u2019s Aaron Connolly, fresh from scoring twice against Spurs last weekend, could make his senior international debut in Tblisi on Saturday. If he shows the same sharpness that he did against Tottenham, then Ireland could take a big step towards Euro 2020 qualification, and young Connolly will be hearing more of that \u2018new Robbie Keane\u2019 talk.

Suffering from discomfort to his adductor, Aaron Ramsey, arguably a more important player for the Welsh than even Gareth Bale, is out of the Slovakia game. Ryan Giggs could be forced into a tactical change and the thinking by Danny Gabbidon and Iwan Roberts on Elis James\u2019s Feast Of Football podcast was that Giggs needs to avoid playing the brand of expansive football he prefers in charge of making his team more difficult to beat. With this in mind, playing five at the back with two midfielders sitting directly in front of them was mooted as a potential solution. Whatever Giggs decides, a very talented generation of Welsh players is in danger of being wasted and the results of the next two games could have a major say in the future of a young manager who has been far from convincing during his tenure so far.

They are third in Group H, behind an exciting young Turkey team and France, who thrashed them 4-0 earlier in the group. On Friday they host Les Bleus, who will be without the injured Paul Pogba and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 but still have no shortage of options. Didier Deschamps could, for instance, use Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s absence to give Wissam Ben Yedder his most meaningful cap to date. The striker, who joined Monaco in the summer and has been as prolific there as he was at all his previous clubs, has had to wait a long time for international recognition but, at 29, he is still young enough and good enough to make an impact. He would boost his chances of appearing in an international tournament if he helps France beat Iceland on Friday and Turkey three days later.

Scotland trail Russia, who are second in Group I behind Belgium, by nine points with four games remaining and their hopes of qualifying via any other route than the play-off place they earned through the Nations League have evaporated. In Ryan Fraser, John McGinn, Andy Robertson, Scott McTominay and John Fleck Scotland have decent players, but their inability to score goals remains aconcern. The six forward players picked by Steve Clarke squad have just eight international goals between them and urgently need to improve that tally ahead of those play-offs so many Scottish hopes are pinned on.

Following their trip to Amsterdam they travel to the Czech Republic for a friendly, before completing their qualifiers against the Dutch at home and Germany away in November. Michael O\u2019Neill will have to make do without Norwich left-back Jamal Lewis, who has pulled out with a knee injury, but the manager remains upbeat about his team\u2019s chances of doing enough in successive qualifiers against the Netherlands to not have to concern himself with a potential route to the finals through the Nations League play-offs. \u201cWe are in a double-header with Holland and I believe if we get four points we will qualify,\u201d he said. Having made his first international start in defeat against Germany last time out, Linfield striker Shayne Lavery could be the manplaying up front faced with a defence marshalled by Virgil van Dijk, as O\u2019Neill has hinted the 20-year-old\u2019s pace and intelligence could be a key weapon in a battle against one of the world\u2019s best defenders.

In their first match, at home to Denmark, they blew a three-goal lead in the last six minutes; and in their last outing, in the Republic of Ireland, they looked comfortable before conceding an 85th-minute equaliser and hanging on for a point. They face those two countries again in the next few days, starting with a trip to Copenhagen on Saturday. Xherdan Shaqiri has chosen to remain in international exile but manager Vladimir Petkovic has recalled Stephan Lichtsteiner after omitting him for the trip to Dublin. Apparently he values the 35-year-old\u2019s experience. \u201cHe is still our captain and leader,\u201d said Petkovic of the Augsburg defender, without saying whether Lichtsteiner will actually play. PD\n\n\u2022 Denmark v Switzerland, 5pm Saturday\n\n8) Crunch time for Finland to break drought\n\nFinland have never qualified for a major tournament. It\u2019s somewhat of an annoyance for a nation of over five million people who gave football the supremely talented Jari Litmanen. Even tiny Iceland have beaten them to the punch. But having assumed a strong position in Group J \u2013 they\u2019re second behind Italy \u2013 they will never have a better chance of enjoying a summer party themselves. Markku Kanerva\u2019s side have won four and lost two (both to Italy) but now it\u2019s crunch time. They face Bosnia-Herzegovina and Armenia next, the two teams directly below them. They travel to the Bilino Polje Stadium in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Saturday. With Norwich\u2019s in-form Teemu Pukki leading the line, Kanerva\u2019s compact system is well set up to pick off their inconsistent opponents on the break. Finland have not conceded a goal against any team except Italy and Pukki has been just as lethal in qualifying as he has in the Premier League, scoring five in his last six. If he can continue his hot streak over the next few days, Finland\u2019s long wait for some summer fun could soon be over.

Now, after a 2-1 loss, qualification from Group E looks unlikely. Hungary did beat a sluggish Croatia in Budapest in their previous group encounter, and looked impressive in doing so. But with Hungary distinctly lacking in individual quality, it\u2019s the sum of their parts that makes this Hungarian apparatus tick. And when two or three of those parts falter, the whole machine malfunctions, as evidenced against Slovakia. Things don\u2019t look like changing in Croatia either, with very few of Hungary\u2019s key men finding any kind of form at club level this season. Yet Hungary are an odd side full of players unheard of in western Europe, but who are prone to big performances in big games. Croatia are massive favourites, but Hungary have refound a quality of turning up when it matters most under Italian coach Marco Rossi. And with Croatia looking decidedly inconsistent since the World Cup, maybe this isn\u2019t as improbable as first thought.

It\u2019s not pretty but maybe, just maybe, the tiny principality (population 76,965) could end that ugly losing streak against Moldova at home. Their visitors are the one nation that have a worse defensive record than them, having shipped 17 goals in six Group H qualifiers to Andorra\u2019s 14. Moldova have managed to win once, 1-0 at home against Andorra, but if ever there was a chance for Koldo \u00c1lvarez to take a point \u2013 or even three \u2013 in a Euro qualifier, it is at the Estadi Nacional on Friday night. It would help if they could score a goal, mind. They haven\u2019t managed that in six Euro 2020 qualifiers but even a 0-0 draw would be enough to make history.
