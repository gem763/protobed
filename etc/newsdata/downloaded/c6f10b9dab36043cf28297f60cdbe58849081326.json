Radiocarbon dating of the samples is estimated to be 95 percent accurate.\n\nPrevious findings of early syphilitic bones have been inconclusive.\n\nMr Connell said: \u2018We\u2019re confident that Christopher Columbus is simply not a feature of the emergence and timing of the disease in Europe,\u2019 he told The Times.\n\n\u2018This puts the nail in the coffin of the Columbus theory.\u2019\n\nTwo of the syphilitic skeletons unearthed at St Mary Spital are from 1200 - 1250 while the other five are from 1250 \u2013 1400. They were buried with coins and other objects that helped the experts corroborate the radiocarbon dating results.\n\nThe site was named after the hospital nearby in the City of London and the skeleton were probably victims of the disease who were patients there.\n\nChristopher Columbus has been blamed for bringing syphilis back from the Americas\n\nOne of the skeletons belong to a child who would have been blind, bald and had teeth that grew at a 45 degree angle through its jaw because of the disease.\n\nMr Connell said: \u2018IT would have had gross facial disfigurement, which would have been very distressing for the child, who was about 10 years old when it died.\n\n\u2018The skull, which should have been smooth, looks like a lunar landscape. It caused a bit of a stir when it was found because the symptoms are so obvious.\u2019\n\nSyphilis causes serious damage to the heart, brain, eyes and bones and if untreated can be fatal. It is carried by the bacterium Treponema palladium.\n\nIn an era hundreds of years before the discovery of antibiotics, syphilis quickly spread and was soon the scourge of every major city.\n\nEver since the first recorded case in Europe took place in 1495 - three years after Columbus's first voyage to the New World - doctors have argued over its origins.\n\nSome have claimed that it existed in Europe in ancient times. But others have claimed it was the price of those early and often violent visits to Latin America.", "description": "Archaelogists excavating bones from St Mary Spital in East London found rough patches on skulls and limbs of some of the skeletons, telling evidence of syphilis.", "authors": ["Niall Firth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://dailymail.co.uk/favicon.ico?v=2", "published_at": "2010-10-25"}
