He ran and threw and scored, until he was broken physically on the field and shattered emotionally by the politics of Redskins Park.\n\nWhat do Redskins fans have so far from the presence of the newest prized rookie quarterback, Dwayne Haskins? Two games, 12 completions in 22 attempts, four interceptions.\n\nIs the poison that flows from the top \u2014 Redskins owner Dan Snyder and his Prince of Darkness, team president Bruce Allen \u2014 down through the veins of this woeful organization so strong that it has already contaminated another top pick?\n\nSadly, there is no antidote, save for escape from Redskins Park.\n\nQuestions are swirling around the team\u2019s reluctance to put Haskins on the field. Typically, quarterbacks who are first-round picks are ready to at least try to compete on an NFL field, particularly those selected at No. 15. The Redskins appear afraid to put Haskins on the field.\n\nWhy? Because they figured out he can\u2019t play? Because he isn\u2019t practicing hard enough? Because he doesn\u2019t know the playbook? Any playbook?\n\nAll these questions are on the table because of the red flags that keep popping up about Haskins \u2014 circumstantial evidence, yes, but enough to raise reasonable doubt.\n\nHere\u2019s what interim head coach Bill Callahan said about Haskins and his development last week. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have some growing pains with young quarterbacks, and we get that,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything in our power to generate a positive result for Dwayne, whether it\u2019s in the classroom or on the field. We\u2019ve done extra work with him, and he\u2019s done extra work. We\u2019re doing everything possible to generate some better execution out of his game that will translate into a win.\u201d\n\nIn other words, he is not ready to see the field for a 1-7 team. That\u2019s troublesome.\n\nThis is the owner\u2019s quarterback, remember. Snyder was the one who insisted they draft Haskins \u2014 a classmate of Snyder\u2019s son at The Bullis School in Potomac, Maryland \u2014 over the objections of his football people, including departed head coach Jay Gruden.\n\nSnyder was the one who met with Haskins at the NFL combine last winter \u2014 the only prospect Snyder met with. Haskins was the only draft pick who got a phone call from Snyder the night of the draft.\n\nSo here we are.\n\nGruden\u2019s out of the way. There\u2019s only an interim head coach between Snyder and orders to play his quarterback. Apparently, that order hasn\u2019t come yet, which means either Snyder believes that this is a good development path for Haskins, or else he has come to the frightening conclusion that his quarterback can\u2019t play.\n\nIt can\u2019t be because Callahan is refusing to listen to Snyder. I mean, he\u2019s the INTERIM head coach. Can you fire the INTERIM head coach? That should be easier than firing the permanent head coach.\n\nFrom Haskins, what we aren\u2019t getting is the impression that he is following these words: \u201cHard work pays off. Hard work beats talent any day, but if you\u2019re talented and work hard, it\u2019s hard to be beat.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s out of Book of RGIII, by the way. Two weeks ago, offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell set off some alarms when he said Haskins was showing more of a sense of urgency in his preparation \u2014 \u201cnot wasting a minute in his preparation\u2026his daily routine, his practice habits.\u201d\n\nThen there was the report from the NFL network that after the 19-9 loss to Minnesota last Thursday, Peterson had told Haskins to \u201cget your nose in the playbook. Learn those plays. Everybody thinks you don\u2019t know them. You\u2019re proving them right. It is time to study the playbook.\u201d\n\nPeterson responded to the report with a video posted on Twitter where he said, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t hear something from me, please don\u2019t attribute it to me. I believe in Dwayne and his potential. With more time, support & commitment, he can grow like any other rookie player.\u201d\n\nI believe that would be called a non-denial denial.\n\nHaskins, who has already raised some eyebrows with his use of social media, came back and admonished Peterson for his post, saying \u201cPlease don\u2019t involve me in this bs media narrative.\u201d\n\nTo which I would suggest this: \u201cGive thanks for those who have done you wrong. They have unknowingly made you stronger in the long run.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s from the Book of RGIII as well. Dwayne Haskins should study that book. It may be the blueprint for his future with this organization.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
