Both benchmarks rose to the highest since May.\n\nPrices were up about 12% by 6:50 p.m. (2250 GMT), as gains were capped after U.S. President Donald Trump said he authorized the release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) if needed in a quantity to be determined because of the attack on Saudi\u2019s facilities.\n\nState oil giant Saudi Aramco said the attack cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day, at a time when Aramco is trying to ready itself for what is expected to be the world\u2019s largest share sale.\n\nAramco gave no timeline for output resumption. A source close to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity could take \u201cweeks, not days.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s oil exports will continue as normal this week as the kingdom taps into stocks from its large storage facilities, an industry source briefed on the developments told Reuters on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe surge in prices is the natural knee jerk reaction but the path ahead and ability to sustain at elevated levels remains dependent on the duration of the outage, the ability to meet export commitments through domestic drawdowns, demand elasticity at higher prices as well as government and agency policy,\u201d said Michael Tran, managing director of energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York.\n\n\u201cEven if the outage normalizes quickly, the threat of sidelining nearly 6% of global oil production is no longer a hypothetical, a black swan or a fat tail. Welcome back, risk premium.\u201d\n\nThe attack on plants in the heartland of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry, including the world\u2019s biggest petroleum-processing facility, came from the direction of Iran, and cruise missiles may have been used, according to a senior U.S. official.\n\n\u201cSaudi authorities have claimed to control the fires, but this falls far short of extinguishing them,\u201d said Abhishek Kumar, head of analytics at Interfax Energy in London.\n\n\u201cThe damage to facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais appears to be extensive, and it may be weeks before oil supplies are normalised,\u201d Kumar said.\n\nRelated Coverage Explainer: Attack on Saudi leaves world without spare oil capacity\n\nSaudi Arabia is set to become a significant buyer of refined products after attacks on Saturday, consultancy Energy Aspects said in a note.\n\nState oil firm Saudi Aramco will likely buy significant quantities of gasoline, diesel and possibly fuel oil while cutting liquefied petroleum gas exports.\n\nU.S. gasoline futures jumped 11%, while U.S. heating oil futures rose about 6.5% at the open.", "description": "Oil prices surged more than 15% to their highest level in nearly four months at the open on Sunday after an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities on Saturday that knocked out more than 5% of global oil supply.", "authors": ["Devika", "Krishna Kumar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430238786&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0RW", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
