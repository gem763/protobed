We should clear out well ahead of Game 5.\n\nEXPRESS FORECAST\n\nToday: Scattered a.m. showers/storms. Highs: Mid- to upper 70s.\n\nTonight: Cooling off, a few clouds. Lows: Upper 40s to mid-50s.\n\nTomorrow: Partly to mostly sunny and nice. Highs: Near 70.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post headquarters.\n\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\n\nSome showers and storms this morning continue to reduce our rain deficit. It\u2019s just too bad it\u2019s falling on a warm weekend day. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be so warm without a front nearby, and the front brings the rain, and . . . well, sorry. Anyway, the rain chances diminish by early afternoon, which begins a several-day stretch of fairly nice weather, despite turning a bit cloudier into midweek.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device.

Even with the morning clouds and rain, temperatures are fairly mild in the 60s to near 70, with a steady breeze form the south-southeast around 10 to 15 mph. Then, once the rain exits to the east by early afternoon and gives way to increasing sunshine, we could see afternoon highs spike to the mid- to upper 70s! Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTonight: Temperatures fall quickly into and down through the 60s during the evening, with partly to mostly clear skies as a cooler breeze blows in form the northwest around 10 mph. That\u2019s still pretty comfortable for Game 5. The overnight continues peaceful and pleasant, with lows dropping to the upper 40s to mid-50s.

With high pressure in control, we\u2019ve got partly to mostly sunny skies and light winds. Temperatures stay warmish, as there\u2019s no real surge of cold air behind the front, with highs reaching near 70. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Our winds shift to more from the east overnight, and that means skies likely take a turn for the cloudier. That\u2019s about the only change, though, as lows again settle in the upper 40s to mid-50s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\n\n\nA classic fall scene near the Washington Monument on Friday. (Eric Cox Photography/Eric Cox Photography)\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nHigh pressure remains in control for Tuesday and Wednesday as well, but being centered offshore to our north, easterly flow continues to keep our skies on the cloudier side. We should remain dry, though, with nice temperatures in the mid-60s to near 70 range for highs. Not too shabby. Tuesday night lows fall back to the 50s.
