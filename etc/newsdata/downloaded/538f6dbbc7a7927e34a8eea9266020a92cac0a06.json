The United States hasn\u2019t. One win at the Rugby World Cup could make their tournaments.\n\nBoth teams are out of contention but both still desperately need something to perk up Rugby World Cup campaigns that are proving every bit as tough as they thought they\u2019d be.\n\nThe U.S. situation is urgent. The Americans haven\u2019t won a World Cup game since 2011 and have won three out of 25 dating back to 1987. The Americans crash-landed at this tournament with an opening 45-7 loss to England that would have been 45-nothing if replacement Bryce Campbell hadn\u2019t dived over at the end of a chaotic final play after the hooter in Kobe.\n\nFrom there, the U.S. went down 33-9 to France and 47-17 to Argentina and is now bottom of Pool C.\n\nCoach Gary Gold said this tournament was about learning lessons for the U.S. Eagles and they got three of them in back-to-back-to-back games against top-tier teams.\n\n\u201cOur preparation was there. Physically and fitness-wise, we\u2019ve been able to live with these teams,\u201d Gold said. \u201cWe\u2019re just not as good as them yet.\u201d\n\nAgainst Tonga on Sunday it\u2019s different because it\u2019s the kind of game the U.S. needs to be winning to prove there\u2019s progress. There will be a skip in the step of the Americans when they get on the plane back to the States if they get it done.\n\nThis is the first Rugby World cup since the start of Major League Rugby, the professional league in America, and it would be great if the U.S. national team could see some knock-on effect. Ten of the players on the squad now play with MLR teams.\n\nRegarding the games against England, France and Argentina, Gold said: \u201cFor us, at this particular moment in time, just to be competitive is really the goal and I think we pretty much achieved that.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to Tonga, Gold adds, \u201cSunday\u2019s going to be important.\u201d\n\nGold also used Friday\u2019s media opportunity to pitch for the United States to get the 2027 Rugby World Cup. The U.S. hasn\u2019t formally bid yet but already has the 2026 soccer World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics, in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI feel so very strongly that if World Rugby genuinely do want to grow the game, as they claim they want to, then USA have to be a contender for the 2027 Rugby World Cup,\u201d Gold said.\n\nWay before that, there\u2019s no stressing how much of a positive effect a victory in a game at this Rugby World Cup can have for rugby back home.\n\nThe U.S. hasn\u2019t played Tonga since 2016 but did beat Samoa, a similar challenge, in August.\n\nLike Samoa, Tonga will bring \u201cmassive physicality,\u201d Gold said. And the U.S. coach thought the Tongans deserved to beat France when they missed out 23-21 last Sunday.\n\nTonga will also play for captain Siale Piutau, who said Friday he was retiring from international rugby after the game on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about hanging up my boots and now I\u2019m making it public,\u201d Piutau told reporters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not putting the focus on myself, but I want to leave the team on a high, that\u2019s my priority. There is no place I would rather be than with these boys.\u201d\n\nThe Americans and Tongans won\u2019t know what to expect at the Hanazono Stadium, Japan\u2019s oldest rugby stadium, after Typhoon Hagibis has roared through Japan as expected on Saturday. Because of the powerful typhoon, the stadium is off-limits on Saturday for the teams, who normally get an on-field practice the day before the game.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s in store, but we are prepared.\u201d Tonga coach Toutai Kefu said. \u201cWe will just have an indoor session if we are allowed out of the hotel. It\u2019s obviously going to be a wet game.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nUnited States: Will Hooley, Blaine Scully (captain), Bryce Campbell, Paul Lasike, Marcel Brache, AJ MacGinty, Ruben de Haas; Cam Dolan, Malon Al-Jiboori, Tony Lamborn, Nick Civetta, Greg Peterson, Titi Lamositele, Joe Taufete\u2019e, Eric Fry.
