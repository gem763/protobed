He has been giving 100 per cent.\n\nAndy Robertson (R) hailed 'top professional' Lallana after Sunday's draw at Old Trafford\n\n'In the changing rooms before games he is one of the loudest. He could easily be quiet as he is on the bench and not playing. But the way he has conducted himself - and, to be fair, [along with] all of the lads who haven't played as much as they would have wanted - Adam is a top, top professional and a top, top guy.\n\n'I'm absolutely delighted for him that he could get on the end of it.'\n\nThe 25-year-old is backing the midfielder to push on after an impressive 20-minute display against United.\n\nHe added: 'When he came on I thought he was brilliant and I thought he changed the game. To get that goal, it will do a world of good for him and his confidence and I think we'll see a lot more from him.'", "description": "The England midfielder has been forced to watch on from the sidelines over the last year, having struggled with repetitive injuries.
