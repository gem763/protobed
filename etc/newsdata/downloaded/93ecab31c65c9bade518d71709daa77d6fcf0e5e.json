It showed that Pillsbury had sent the journalist an email reading: \u201cActually I got a quite a bit of background on Hunter Biden from the Chinese.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPillsbury, 74, gave The Washington Post an even different explanation later on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMost everything I learned was already public or well-known,\u201d he said.\n\nPillsbury claimed he was told that money from the Bank of China went to Hunter Biden\u2019s firm but that it was difficult to determine exactly how much. He said the Chinese were largely reticent to speak about Biden.\n\n\u201cThey really, really didn\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d he said.\n\nPillsbury said he spoke with Trump just before he went on his trip to China last month, but he said the president didn\u2019t ask him to raise Biden to Chinese officials. \u201cI haven\u2019t reported back to him, no,\u201d he said.\n\nThe China expert said he\u2019d never spoken with Trump about Hunter Biden but was aware of the president calling for the Chinese to investigate from the South Lawn of the White House last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat a wonderful, hypothetical question,\u201d he said, when asked if he plans to report back to Trump. Pillsbury declined to say more, saying that White House officials had asked him not to disclose his conversations with the president.\n\nChinese officials, Pillsbury said, also told him that Trump was more likely to win because of impeachment \u2013 and were deeply interested in the 2020 election.\n\nPillsbury regularly speaks with Trump, who calls him \u201cMr. Pillsbury\u201d and tells others he is the world\u2019s leading expert on China.\n\nThe president has said without offering any evidence that the younger Biden received $1.5 billion from the Chinese government as a \u201cpayoff\u201d to curry favor with the then-vice president. Trump said last week that Chinese authorities should investigate, a statement that shocked many Republican lawmakers. Some have said they assumed the president was joking, but the president and top aides have not provided more clarity as to his intention.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAndrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said Pillsbury\u2019s comments are the latest example of a Trump associate \u201cseeking dirt with which to smear the Biden family\u201d in a foreign country.\n\n\u201cWhile the president\u2019s limited number of vocal defenders have tried claiming that his South Lawn statement asking China to investigate the Biden family somehow wasn\u2019t a \u2018real\u2019 request, Pillsbury\u2019s admission again lays bare that there is no depth to which Trump will not sink to avoid facing Joe Biden in next year\u2019s election,\u201d Bates said.\n\nLike the president\u2019s own family members, the former vice president\u2019s son has been involved in business ventures in China. No evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of either Biden has been made public.\n\nAD\n\nPillsbury, a China specialist at the Hudson Institute in Washington, told C-SPAN that he had traveled to Beijing at the end of September and had met with unspecified \u201cChinese.\u201d Like many American scholars, the veteran analyst routinely meets with his counterparts at Chinese think tanks, some of which are affiliated with the government.\n\nAD\n\nPillsbury, a hard-liner on China policy who has not worked in government since the Reagan administration, has enjoyed a higher profile recently thanks to the president\u2019s endorsement. Trump once called him \u201cprobably the leading authority on China.\u201d\n\nAfter declining to say during a separate appearance on Fox Business whether he had raised the subject of Hunter Biden with the Chinese at the president\u2019s request, Pillsbury told C-SPAN that he was not acting on White House orders.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t ask me to raise the issue,\u201d he said.\n\nThe dizzying turn of events comes as U.S. and Chinese negotiators resumed trade talks in Washington. The first such high-level encounter since July, the negotiations are aimed at producing a deal that would mark at least a cease-fire in the trade war that began last year.\n\nThe Pillsbury affair is just the latest in a recent flurry of developments surrounding the talks, which have been the subject of repeated rumors that have caused financial markets to swoon.\n\nAD", "description": "Michael Pillsbury said he received information on Biden from the Chinese, but then claimed he didn\u2019t, then admits he did.", "authors": ["David J.
