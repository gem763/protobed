Bernie Sanders for acknowledging that middle-class taxes would increase under the plan.\n\n\u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here and saying how he\u2019s going to pay for this, and that taxes are going to go up,\u201d Klobuchar said at the forum outside Columbus, Ohio. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.\u201d\n\nDuring the heated exchange, Klobuchar charged that Warren was \u201cmaking Republican talking points,\u201d and later targeted her proposed wealth tax.\n\n\u201cI want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires \u2014 not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires,\u201d Klobuchar said, referencing Tom Steyer, the environmental activist and former hedge fund manager participating in the debate. \u201cWe just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea.\u201d\n\nWarren responded in part that \u201cthe rich are not like you and me,\u201d asserting that \u201cthe really, really billionaires are making their money off their accumulated wealth, and it just keeps growing.\u201d She added: \u201cLook, I understand that this is hard, but I think, as Democrats, we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started.\u201d\n\nBut Klobuchar countered: \u201cI think simply because you have different ideas doesn't mean you're fighting for regular people. I wouldn't even be up on this stage if it wasn't for unions and the dignity of work.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar was hardly alone in seeking to blunt the liberal lawmaker\u2019s momentum Tuesday. Befitting her status as the ascendant force in her party\u2019s presidential nominating contest, Warren also took incoming fire from Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke.", "description": "Amy Klobuchar repeatedly bludgeoned Elizabeth Warren at Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate, with the Minnesota senator advocating a pragmatic governing approach over the progressive policies favored by her Massachusetts colleague.
