All 10 Democratic candidates who debated in last month's event in Houston have qualified again, with the addition of two new faces: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and billionaire businessman Tom Steyer. The debate is expected to mark the return to the campaign trail for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who suffered a heart attack this month. Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, arrives amid a string of polls that shows her support surging with likely Democratic primary voters. But the biggest storyline of the debate could revolve around how the candidates talk about the fast-moving impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump. CNN's Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett and the New York Times' Marc Lacey will act as debate moderators and it will air on CNN, CNN.com and NYTimes.com.\n\nImpeachment inquiry: Subpoena deadlines upon Giuliani, Pence\n\nIn the latest news regarding the impeachment investigation, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's deadline to submit subpoenaed documents is Tuesday, as is Vice President Mike Pence's. Giuliani hasn't said whether he will comply with the subpoena, and Pence may not comply. Tuesday is also the deadline for subpoenas to the Pentagon and the White House Office of Management and Budget for documents detailing why military aid to Ukraine was frozen. Despite the White House proclamation against cooperating, Defense Secretary Mark Esper has said he will comply with the subpoena. On Monday, Fiona Hill, who had been the National Security Council's senior director for Europe and Russia, spent more than 10 hours fielding questions from lawmakers on three committees investigating Trump's dealings with Ukraine: Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform. She did not make any comments or answer questions from reporters after she was finished.\n\nCLOSE Public opinion polling has shown noticeable shifts in attitudes towards impeachment, though every single poll has asked about impeachment differently. USA TODAY\n\nFederal tax extension deadline is here\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the roughly 15 million taxpayers who asked the Internal Revenue Service for an extension on filing your federal taxes in April, time's almost up. The federal tax extension deadline hits Tuesday, and if you miss the October deadline, you\u2019re likely to face a hefty penalty for failing to file. Taxpayers who owe the IRS should have sent in an estimated payment before the regular tax deadline in the spring. If they didn't \u2013 or low-balled what they owe the taxman \u2013 they could be on the hook for an underpayment penalty. If you can\u2019t pay what you owe right away, the IRS will work out a payment plan. The IRS may also waive penalties in certain cases, such as taxpayers who have suffered through a natural disaster. There\u2019s also relief through the agency's \"first-time penalty abatement\" program.\n\nCLOSE The higher standard deduction in the tax law signed by Donald Trump last year may require a few new moves for you to lessen your tax burden this year. USA TODAY\n\nCuba Gooding Jr. faces arraignment in groping case\n\nThe groping case against actor Cuba Gooding Jr. entered a new phase of confusion Monday, with conflicting claims over how many women have accused him and even what time his arraignment is scheduled for on Tuesday. Gooding, 51, who was charged in June with grabbing the breast of a woman at a New York City bar, is scheduled to be arraigned again after he was indicted last week on the original charge, plus a new and separate misdemeanor sex crime involving a different accuser. Neither of the accusers have been identified by name yet. Details of the second accuser's allegation have not been revealed either, but the indictment is scheduled to be unsealed Tuesday. Mark Heller, one of Gooding's defense lawyers, said the actor intends to plead not guilty and to seek two separate trials on the two accusations. Gooding's case is the second celebrity criminal case scheduled to be tried in New York in the post-#MeToo era. It's also a rare example of prosecuting a groping case, a crime seldom reported in New York.\n\nFarrow's book detailing Weinstein reporting, experience with NBC on sale\n\nRonan Farrow, the journalist whose investigation into Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual abuse for The New Yorker earned him a Pulitzer Prize last year, shares his account of reporting on the movie mogul in his new book, \"Catch and Kill,\" which is set to be released Tuesday. Part-memoir, \"Catch and Kill\" details Farrow's months-long struggle to report the Weinstein story for NBC, where he started as host of MSNBC's \"Ronan Farrow Daily\" in 2014, before becoming an investigative correspondent for \"Today.\" Details leaked early from the book are staggering, including new information about Matt Lauer's 2017 firing from NBC and an accusation of rape against the former \"Today\" host. Lauer has since denied the allegations.\n\nCLOSE Ronan Farrow talks about his book, \"Catch and Kill,\" which he says refers to seven complaints against former NBC \"Today\" show anchor Matt Lauer.
