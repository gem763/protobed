Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, increased 0.1% in August. Spending increases on Food/Beverages, Transportation, and Automotive sales drove the slight increase.\n\nConsumer spending has dampened the impact that the ongoing trade war between US and China has had on the economy. The trade war has decreased the amount of business investments and has hit the manufacturing sector hard. Despite the rugged geopolitical and macroeconomic landscape, consumer spending has continued to bolster the economy thanks in part to the lowest unemployment level in almost 50 years. Let\u2019s take a look at some stocks within the sectors that fueled consumer spending growth in August.\n\nCopa HoldingsCPA is a leading Latin American provider of passenger and cargo services through its Copa Airlines and AeroRepublica operating subsidiaries.
