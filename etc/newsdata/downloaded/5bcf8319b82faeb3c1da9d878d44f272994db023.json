Sato then allegedly narrowed down the area using Google Street View, identifying the station closest to her home, before stalking Ms Matsuoka.\n\nPolice suspect Sato followed Ms Matsuoka from the station after she had finished a concert and attacked her as she entered her apartment building. Sato allegedly placed a towel over her head, threw her to the ground and molested her.\n\n\u201cPeople should be fully aware that posting pictures and video on social media runs the risk of divulging personal data\u201d, a police investigator said.\n\nThe incident is just the latest involving obsessed fans of young female performers in Japan.", "description": "Tokyo police have arrested a man suspected of tracking down a female pop star, whom he later allegedly assaulted, by scrutinising reflections in her eyes from social media posts.", "authors": ["Julian Ryall"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212678211-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrcGu7wMGpP5enjnIwuOtoxx6e_cjhk53ndqL7MUUKyk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
