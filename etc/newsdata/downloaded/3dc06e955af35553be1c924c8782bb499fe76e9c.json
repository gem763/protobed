There was nothing going on that I wasn\u2019t open with him about. That\u2019s the way I deal with my boss anywhere I have ever been,\u201d he said.\n\nMattis, a career Marine who retired as a four-star general in 2013, is promoting his new book \"Call Sign Chaos\" (co-authored with Bing West), which he said does not reference working in the Trump administration.\n\n25 BODIES FOUND AFTER CALIFORNIA SCUBA BOAT FIRE, COAST GUARD SAYS\n\n\u201cHe [Trump] was elected by the American people,\u201d Mattis said.\n\nMattis said he came out of retirement to work for the Trump administration. \u201cI was asked to serve and I was raised by the Greatest Generation. But when you\u2019re asked to serve, Republican or Democrat, don\u2019t start wringing your hands asking what to do. Just roll up your sleeves if you\u2019re prepared. Go to work and do your best. It\u2019s very, very simple.\u201d\n\nAmong other military matters, Mattis weighed in on the U.S. military\u2019s involvement with Hurricane Dorian. \u201cIf FEMA needs them, they\u2019ll be ready.\u201d\n\nHe also discussed the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001, after the hosts read an excerpt from his new book that touched on America being able to form allies, despite its history.\n\nFORMER NAVY SEAL, 52, WHO WAS WOUNDED IN BERGDAHL MISSION, HEADS TO YALE AS A FRESHMAN\n\nMattis said that after the 9/11 attack, he listed Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, Norway, Turkey, Jordan, Australia and New Zealand as \u201callies\u201d who helped us.\n\n\u201cThese countries hadn\u2019t been attacked. But their values were attacked. And the values America stands for; I believe you have to go a very long way to find a country more generous in its nature and supportive in those values,\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMattis went on to say, \u201cThe bottom line is terrorism is an ambient threat. It\u2019s going to be with us. It\u2019s how do we organize with allies to suffocate it is the bottom line. And you can declare war over it. You can want it over.
