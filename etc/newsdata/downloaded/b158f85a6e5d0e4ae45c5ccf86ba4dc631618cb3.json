Jennifer Wexton asked him to apologize for a comment that upset the transgender community.\n\nDuring a House Financial Services Committee hearing on housing policy, Ms. Wexton asked Mr. Carson whether he would like to apologize for his reported comment during a HUD meeting last month about \u201cbig, hairy men\u201d using women\u2019s homeless shelters. Some people in attendance told The Washington Post at the time that they viewed the remark as disrespectful to transgender people.\n\nMr. Carson repeated his denial that the remark had anything to do with transgender people and explained that he was recalling a story he heard from a women\u2019s group in Alaska about men pretending to be women in order to gain access to women\u2019s shelters.\n\n\u201cWell, first of all, I didn\u2019t describe transgender women that way, I was relating a story that a women\u2019s group told me about big hairy men,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cWho are not transgender women by the way \u2014 coming into your facility and having to be accepted because of the rules that were in place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t feel the need to apologize for those comments?\u201d Ms. Wexton asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Carson responded. \u201cI think this whole concept of political correctness: \u2018You can say this. You can\u2019t say that. You can\u2019t repeat what someone said,\u2019 is total foolishness and it\u2019s going to destroy our nation and we need to be more mature than that.\u201d\n\nMs. Wexton later tweeted a clip of the exchange, writing, \u201cToday I gave @SecretaryCarson the opportunity to apologize for his remarks slurring transgender women as, \u2018big, hairy men.\u2019 Regrettably, he declined that opportunity. Hateful words translate into discriminatory policy\u2014and Secretary Carson has demonstrated that time and again.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
