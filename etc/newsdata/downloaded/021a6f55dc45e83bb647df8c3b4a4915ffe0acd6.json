Asked about whether such attacks threaten Democratic unity, Ryan said the party has a common goal.\n\n\u2018Unifying Force\u2019\n\n\u201cThere is a very unifying force in this world for Democrats and he is the current occupant of the White House,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nIn his call for unity in Manchester, Booker offered up a veiled swipe against rival Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\n\u201cWe Democrats have to be careful,\u201d Booker said in prepared remarks. \u201cI don\u2019t care who our nominee is, but we cannot tolerate Democrats who turn against other Democrats and try to tear us down.\u201d\n\nBooker\u2019s remarks were seen as directed at Sanders, who refused to wholeheartedly back Hillary Clinton after she won the nomination in 2016.\n\nBooker, who trails the top-tier candidates at 2.5% in a recent average of polls by RealClearPolitics.com, was asked later by reporters to explain his call for unity after repeatedly faulting Biden on race issues, including calling him \u201can architect of mass incarceration\u201d for working on the 1994 tough-on-crime legislation.\n\n\u201cI think pointing out differences is OK,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about what we\u2019ve seen in the past election where you had Democrats literally, even after the primary was over, trying to tear down the nominee of our party.\u201d\n\nSanders was widely criticized by Democrats in 2016 for not being sufficiently supportive of Clinton after she won the nomination. While Sanders eventually backed her, aides and allies complained his tone was begrudging and didn\u2019t help bring his supporters on board.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou in Manchester at megkolfopoul@bloomberg.net;Jennifer Epstein in Manchester at jepstein32@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Matthew G.
