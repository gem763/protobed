And to a certain extent, that\u2019s a key piece of the puzzle: the Florida businessmen stand accused of funneling very large amounts of illegal campaign contributions to various Republican politicians and political entities, including a leading super PAC allied with Donald Trump.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, according to prosecutors \u2013 who took Parnas and Fruman into custody shortly before they were prepared to take a one-way flight out of the country \u2013 the two cooked up a variety of schemes to make illegal donations to Republicans.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t just a campaign-finance controversy, and it\u2019s important to appreciate what else these guys were up to.\n\n[Parnas and Fruman] were helping President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani set up meetings with high level Ukrainian officials, according to documents obtained by the State Department inspector general. Giuliani has acknowledged that he lobbied those people to investigate the Bidens and the 2016 campaign, in what Democrats say was an effort to uncover dirt on the president\u2019s political enemies.\n\nWhile the nature of the criminal charges obviously matter, yesterday\u2019s developments are also a key ingredient to the larger impeachment crisis unfolding around Donald Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to do this justice in a single blog post, so I\u2019ll just encourage you to watch Rachel\u2019s A block from last night. In the meantime, though, let\u2019s pause to note that Parnas and Fruman may not be the only ones who\u2019ll face charges.\n\nGeoffrey Berman, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, explicitly told reporters yesterday that his office\u2019s investigation is \u201congoing,\u201d suggesting additional indictments may be on the way.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that CNN ran this report:\n\nRudy Giuliani\u2019s financial dealings with two associates indicted on campaign finance-related charges are under scrutiny by investigators overseeing the case, law enforcement officials briefed on the matter said. The FBI and prosecutors in Manhattan are examining Giuliani\u2019s involvement in the broader flow of money that have become the focus of alleged violations that are at the center of the allegations against Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the sources said. The sources did not say that Giuliani was a target of the investigation.\n\nBloomberg News added early this morning that, according to a law enforcement source, Giuliani \u201cis being scrutinized by federal investigators for his financial dealings.\u201d\n\nNeither the CNN report nor the Bloomberg News report have been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say what, if anything, will come of this, though we learned some additional contextual details as yesterday unfolded, including the fact that Giuliani was with Parnas and Fruman the day before their arrest at \u2013 where else? \u2013 Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel. We also learned that Parnas and Fruman had one-way tickets to Vienna. Giuliani was also on his way to Vienna.\n\nAll of this, incidentally, is unfolding two weeks after Giuliani told The Atlantic, \u201cI will be the hero! These morons \u2013 when this is over, I will be the hero.\u201d\n\nThe president was asked yesterday, \u201cAre you concerned that Rudy Giuliani could be indicted in all of this?\u201d Trump, whose original personal attorney is already in prison, replied, \u201cWell, I hope not.\u201d", "description": "Yesterday, we saw the first arrests of Donald Trump's impeachment crisis.
