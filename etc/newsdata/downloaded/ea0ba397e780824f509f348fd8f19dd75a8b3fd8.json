He then questioned why the results of the DNA test have not been released yet.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere\u2019s evidence here of homicide that should be investigated, to see if it is or isn\u2019t homicide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 80 days and the brother feels he\u2019s getting the run-around,\u201d added Baden.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Fox News contributor Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, on Wednesday's \"Fox & Friends\" suggested deceased sex offender | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/jeffrey-epstein-mugshot-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
