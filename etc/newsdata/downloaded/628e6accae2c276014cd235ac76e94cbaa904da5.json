There are unclassified and classified systems that are not interconnected. Then there is still another where very sensitive information is stored - one that only a handful of officials can access.\n\nMemos and documents created to recount and transcribe presidential calls with foreign leaders typically are classified as \u201csecret,\u201d one of the lowest levels of classified material. That makes sense because presidents aren\u2019t usually in the habit of sharing \u201ctop secret\u201d U.S. information with leaders of other nations.\n\nThis is exactly what happened with the information about President Donald Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The memorandum was classified as \u201csecret,\u201d and it was entered into a computerized system that stores other \u201csecret\u201d and \u201ctop secret\u201d information.\n\nBut the whistleblower alleges that several White House officials became so concerned about the content of the call that they intervened to \u201clock down\u201d all records of it. Especially, the whistleblower wrote, the word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced - as is customary - by the White House Situation Room.\n\n\u201cWhite House officials told me that they were \u2018directed\u2019 by White House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored for coordination, finalization and distribution to Cabinet-level officials,\u201d the whistleblower said in the complaint.\n\nThe whistleblower says the transcript was loaded into the system reserved for the most sensitive information, describing that as \u201can abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\u201d\n\nNate Jones, who served as director of counterterrorism at the National Security Council during the Obama administration, said the highly sensitive system has severe limitations on access.\n\n\u201cIt is a very exclusive system,\u201d said Jones, who founded Culper Partners, a consulting firm. He said the transfer of the transcript \u201cdidn\u2019t happen by accident. Somebody had to do it.\u201d\n\nSteven Aftergood, who directs the Federation of American Scientists\u2019 Project on Government Secrecy, said the concern is that placing the Zelenskiy call records on the more restricted server was an irregular practice that could be a prelude to record destruction.\n\n\u201cIt also may have signaled an awareness of misconduct,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s not known when the information about the call was moved to the more highly classified system. Some intelligence officials have speculated that it\u2019s possible that White House officials ordered it placed on the higher classified system as a way of preserving, not covering up, the record of the call.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The whistleblower complaint at the heart of Congress' impeachment inquiry opened a window Thursday into government computer systems that White House and other government employees use to share and manage classified information on a day-to-day basis.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Deb Riechmann"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/trump_impeachment_whistleblower_25161_c0-106-4896-2960_s1770x1032.jpg?36a8c0936f36de295c31751c3365b374a90f8236", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
