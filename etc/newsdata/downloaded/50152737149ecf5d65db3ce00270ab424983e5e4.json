That\u2019s How Stark Inequality Is In India", "language": "en", "text": "Notwithstanding the slowdown in India\u2019s auto sector, luxury automobile manufacturer Mercedes-Benz India has said that it has delivered more than 600 cars during Dhanteras across markets in India.\n\nThe figures come at a time when the overall mood in the Indian market is down, the economy is visibly in perils while job losses continue to plague a vast majority of the country\u2019s population.\n\nThe company\u2019s impressive sales performance comes after it had delivered more than 200 cars on Dussehra and Navratri in Mumbai and Gujarat, reported IANS. Further, Mercedes-Benz India handed more than 250 cars to customers on Dhanteras in Delhi-NCR alone.\n\nRepresentative Image.

BCCL\n\nHowever, these figures remind us of the repeated warnings issued by industry stakeholders and bodies such as SIAM (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers) that has warned that we are staring at the worst downturn ever in the automobile sector. It has cautioned that at least 3.5 lakh jobs have been lost in the auto sector alone and that more layoffs are in waiting.\n\nSeveral leading automobile players such as Ashok Leyland had also earlier cut down their working days as the sales continued to decline.\n\nWhile the slowdown in the auto-industry has crippled the backbone of India\u2019s middle class, manufacturers continue to complain that the hasty implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) along with the sudden decision to demonetise high value currency notes have begun to cast adverse impact on our economy.\n\nREPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE. TWITTER\n\nTop brands that rule the Indian market in the undergarment segment such as Rupa, Dollar and Lux Cozi have pointed out that their sales haven\u2019t picked up even in the festive season. They complain that shops are not buying new stocks while also delaying payments, attributing the cause to the low spirits of the market.\n\nThese rather contradicting mood in two entirely different sectors lives to tell the sordid tale of inequality in India where the rich have too much and the poor have too little. This rising inequality is now staring straight at the middle class, and with little respite in sight, may not only hamper growth but also add further woes to our crippling economy.\n\nWith Inputs From Agencies", "description": "Notwithstanding the slowdown in India\u2019s auto sector, luxury automobile manufacturer Mercedes-Benz India has said that it has delivered more than 600 cars during Dhanteras across markets in India.
