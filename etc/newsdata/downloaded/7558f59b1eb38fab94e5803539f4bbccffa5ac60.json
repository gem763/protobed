Yet on Saturday, many voters expressed equal fear and frustration over relentless government corruption and the widespread chaos at polling stations.\n\nA deeply flawed election and contested result could drive the war-weary country into chaos.\n\nMany Afghans found incomplete voters' lists, unworkable biometric identification systems aimed at curbing fraud, and in some cases hostile election workers.\n\nRuhollah Nawroz, a representative of the Independent Complaints Commission tasked with monitoring the process, said the problems were countrywide.\n\nNawroz said he arrived at a polling centre in the Taimani neighbourhood of Kabul, the capital, at 6 a.m. and \"hour by hour I was facing problems.\"\n\nPolls opened at 7 a.m. local time and closed at 5 p.m. after the Independent Election Commission (IEC) extended polling by one hour.\n\nWomen line up outside a polling station in a western neighbourhood of Kabul on Saturday.

If no candidate wins 51 per cent of the vote, a second round will be held between the two leading candidates.\n\nVoter Hajji Faqir Bohman, who was speaking on behalf of disgruntled voters at the Taimani polling centre, said the polling was so disorganized and flawed that even if his candidate wins \"I will never believe that it was a fair election.\"\n\nThe leading contenders are incumbent President Ashraf Ghani and his partner in the five-year-old unity government, Abdullah Abdullah, who already alleges power abuse by his opponent.\n\nA young woman, Shabnam Rezayee, was attacked by an election worker after insisting on seeing the voter's list when she was told her name was not on the list. Rezayee said the worker hurled abuses at her, directing insults at her ethnicity. She then punched and scratched her.\n\nWhen it ended and the attacker left, Rezayee found her name on the list and voted. \"I am very strong,\" she said.\n\nAbsentee poll workers\n\nIn Kabul, turnout was sporadic and in the morning hours it was rare to see a crowded polling centre. Afghans, who had patiently lined up before the voting centres were opened, entered in some locations to find that election officials had yet to arrive by opening time.\n\nThe government's push to hold the vote was in itself controversial. In an interview with The Associated Press last week, former Afghan president Hamid Karzai, who still wields heavy influence, warned that the vote could be destabilizing for the country at a time of deep political uncertainty and might hinder restarting the peace process with the Taliban.\n\nOn Saturday, one of the first reports of violence came from southern Afghanistan, the former spiritual heartland of the Taliban. A bomb attack on a local mosque where a polling station was located wounded 15 people, a doctor at the main hospital in the city of Kandahar said.\n\nIn northern Kunduz, where Taliban have previously threatened the city \u2014 even briefly taking control of some areas \u2014 insurgents fired mortar rounds into the municipality and attacked Afghan security forces on its outskirts, said Ghulam Rabani Rabani, a council member for the province.\n\nRabani said the attacks are to \"frighten people and force them to stay in their homes and not participate in the election.\"\n\nHe said ongoing fighting has wounded as many as 40 people.\n\n'It's a mess'\n\nTens of thousands of police, intelligence officials and Afghan National Army personnel were deployed throughout the country to protect the 4,942 election centres. Authorities said 431 polling centres will stay closed because it was impossible to guarantee their security since they were either in areas under Taliban control or where insurgents could threaten nearby villages.\n\nAt one polling station in Kabul's well-to-do Shahr-e-Now neighbourhood, Ahmad Shah, 32, cast his vote, but said the election worker forgot to ink his finger \u2014 which is mandatory to prevent multiple voting by the same person.\n\n\"What sort of system is this?\" he asked, frustrated that he had risked his safety to vote and expressed fear that fraud will mar the election results. \"It's a mess.\"\n\nElections in Afghanistan are notoriously flawed and in the last presidential polls in 2014, allegations of widespread corruption were so massive that the United States intervened to prevent violence. No winner was declared and the U.S. cobbled together the unity government in which Ghani and Abdullah shared equal power \u2014 Ghani as president and Abdullah as chief executive, a newly created position.", "description": "Afghanistan's presidential polls have closed amid fears that accusations of fraud and misconduct could overwhelm any election results, while insurgent attacks aimed at disrupting voting in the country's north and south caused dozens of casualties.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5301496.1569684589!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/afghanistan-elections.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
