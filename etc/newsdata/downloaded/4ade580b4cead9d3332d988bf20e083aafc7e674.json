They may not trust any proposal Jones brings them, and thus refuse to ratify it as a form of protest. That could easily turn what should have been a short strike into a much longer one.\n\nThe UAW has taken note of the decade-long run of high profits posted by General Motors, Ford Motor Co. and FCA-Chrysler, and understandably wants to claw back some of the concessions it has made over the years to help keep the automakers afloat.\n\nThe union wants base wage increases, more job security and stricter limits on temporary workers.\n\nBut there are signs that the boom years may be coming to a close. Sales have weakened somewhat recently.\n\nBut the bigger worry is uncertainty over trade policy.\n\nThe tariffs already imposed by the Trump administration are cutting into profit margins, and the ones the president is threatening could drive costs much higher.\n\nDespite past contract give-backs, the domestic manufacturers are still at a competitive disadvantage with the foreign automakers who operate in the United States. For GM, the labor cost gap is $13 an hour; for Ford it's $11 and FCA is at $5.\n\nA contract that widens the advantage of the foreign companies risks cutting into market share of the Big Three.\n\nGM is the strike target. As always, the hype for a walkout is running high. Some experts predict that instead of a targeted strike at one key facility, this could be a company-wide action, shutting down everything.\n\nJones may see a strike as just the thing he needs to rally membership to his support and turn the narrative of the scandal away from any alleged misdeeds by union leadership and toward the companies and federal government.\n\nBut despite the warning signs, conditions are still relatively good for auto companies and autoworkers. Profits are high, and so are profit sharing checks.\n\nPutting that record stretch of prosperity at risk with a strike would be self-destructive, and frankly, foolish.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2019/09/13/editorial-uaw-dont-walk-out/2291682001/", "description": "Both the automakers and the union are going through a period of instability, as well as tremendous\u00a0uncertainty about the future.", "authors": ["The Detroit News", "Published P.M.
