Fisher spoke of doing acid and his belief that charities are immoral. He also made crude comments about genitalia, attendees said, and mentioned financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was indicted on federal sex-trafficking charges earlier this year before dying by suicide in prison.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite a Tiburon policy that requires summit attendees to keep private what they hear and discuss there, three CEOs publicly shared their accounts of what Fisher said in the interest of exposing his behavior and holding the self-proclaimed \u201cself-made multibillionaire\u201d accountable.\n\nAlex Chalekian, founder and chief executive of Lake Avenue Financial in Pasadena, Calif., came forward first, posting a video to Twitter hours after Fisher\u2019s remarks. Chalekian called the fireside chat a \u201ctrue debacle\u201d and said Fisher\u2019s words were \u201cabsolutely horrifying.\u201d Rachel Robasciotti, founder and chief executive of wealth management firm Robasciotti and Philipson in San Francisco, and Sonya Dreizler, a speaker and consultant to financial services firms, publicly confirmed Chalekian\u2019s account online and in media reports.\n\nThey criticized the wealth management industry\u2019s lack of diversity and cited incidents like Fisher\u2019s Tiburon remarks as evidence of why women and people of color do not feel welcome.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen you have power and you get onstage to share your worldview, and when your worldview includes women as sexual objects \u2026 that is irresponsible,\u201d Robasciotti said in an interview with The Post. \u201cYou\u2019re peddling your worldview, and people are adopting it.\u201d\n\nAmid the backlash, Fisher was initially defiant in an interview with Bloomberg, defending his remarks by saying he had \u201cgiven a lot of talks, a lot of times, in a lot of places and said stuff like this and never gotten that type of response.\u201d He also claimed attendees had mischaracterized what he said and were being unfair.\n\nFisher, 68, later issued a formal apology.\n\nRoame denounced Fisher\u2019s remarks and said he would never again be invited to speak at Tiburon. He praised Chalekian for speaking out.\n\nAD\n\nFisher had been previously honored at the Tiburon CEO Summit and has written 11 books, regularly writes newspaper columns on finance and has a net worth of $3.7 billion. He founded Fisher Investments in 1979, and it has grown into the world\u2019s largest Registered Investment Adviser, managing $100 billion as of February, with $1 billion in revenue.\n\nAD\n\nThe firm manages private, individual clients and institutions, like the state of Michigan\u2019s pension fund. The State of Michigan Retirement Systems has more than $70 billion in assets. Fisher Investments was responsible for managing $600 million of the retirement systems\u2019 funds.\n\nBraeutigam said in his letter to the investment board that Michigan\u2019s Bureau of Investment decided to fire Fisher Investments after learning of Fisher\u2019s remarks from news reports.\n\nAD\n\n\u201c\u2026 All were in unanimous agreement that prompt termination is the correct course of action,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThere is no excuse to not treat everyone with dignity and respect. We have high expectations of our managers (and staff), not just with regards to returns but also in how they exhibit integrity and respect to all individuals.\u201d\n\nFisher Investments had managed state funds for 15 years, Braeutigam said in the letter, writing that the firm\u2019s \u201cperformance has been good (beating the S&P 1500).\" He added that his staff had not \"previously witnessed or been aware of any type of similar comments along the lines of the founder\u2019s recent statements.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn our opinion, this history does not out-weigh the inappropriateness of the comments made by the founder,\u201d Braeutigam wrote.\n\nThe state of Michigan\u2019s in-house investment team will now manage the retirement funds for state employees and public school teachers, state officials said.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "A Michigan government official called Ken Fisher's comments \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\"", "authors": ["Katie Mettler", "Reporter Covering Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zDQUNwPGdnOuZKjIwWvE3S7rPAA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/APWDF6HLWMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
