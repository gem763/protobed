Except there's that $150K limitation (even if work-arounds exist for retirement programs). Besides, institutions and endowments target higher returns than TREA provides.\n\nI know ESG is a hot area, but I see too many obstacles in the prospectus that would limit TREA's general appeal.\n\nBob", "description": "ESG Angle https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/946155/000162828019011102/reagrowthemlcampaign.htm More ESG Angle - 19128", "authors": ["Contributor", "Participant", "Explorer"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D"}
