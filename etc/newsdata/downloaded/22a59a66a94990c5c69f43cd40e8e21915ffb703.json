Imahara sits down with Arduino co-founder and CTO Massimo Banzi to examine the prototyping tools designers and developers use to understand and articulate the capabilities and limits of an idea. The pair also explores how the open source movement contributes to broadening access to innovation. The Engineering Big Ideas series is sponsored by Mouser\u2019s valued suppliers Analog Devices, Intel\u00ae, Microchip Technology and Molex.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about this second episode of Engineering Big Ideas. Prototype design is meant to create something completely new,\u201d said Glenn Smith, President and CEO of Mouser Electronics. \u201cThrough open source hardware and software, companies like Arduino present significant opportunity to designers and developers by removing barriers and opening gates to innovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOpen source is a perfect example of innovation through collaboration and shared access to knowledge,\u201d added Imahara. \u201cRapid prototyping is a natural fit for this environment; ideas can come to life quickly and cost-effectively.\u201d\n\nGlobal electronic component distributor Mouser Electronics is teaming up with engineer Grant Imahara for the fifth consecutive year to present the Engineering Big Ideas series, which explores the process of turning an idea into a product and examines the path to commercialization \u2014 from discovery to design and eventually development.\n\nThe Empowering Innovation Together program has been one of the most recognized and notable electronic component educational programs since 2015, highlighting a range of innovative developments from IoT and smart cities of the future to robotics technologies.\n\nTo learn more about this and all of Mouser\u2019s Empowering Innovation Together series, visit www.mouser.com/empowering-innovation and follow Mouser on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAbout Mouser Electronics\n\nMouser Electronics, a Berkshire Hathaway company, is an award-winning, authorized semiconductor and electronic component distributor focused on rapid New Product Introductions from its manufacturing partners for electronic design engineers and buyers.
