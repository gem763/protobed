It said it is reviewing its membership of industry groups and has withdrawn from some of them but believes engagement with some of them helps to promote best practice.\n\nThe pensions board said proxy voting advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis, who act for institutional investors, had not recommended its clients support the resolution and called for a meeting with them and the investors to discuss the issue.\n\n\u201cThe decision by the proxy voting advisors ISS and Glass Lewis not to recommend support for the co-filed shareholder resolution raises serious questions about how investors can receive advice that enables them to meet their fiduciary duties to navigate the financial risks posed by climate change.\u201d\n\nAsked to comment, Aaron Bertinetti, Glass Lewis\u2019 senior vice president, research and engagement said investors focusing only on an adviser\u2019s approach to a proposal rather than \u201cthe extensive analysis, reasoning, expertise and engagement such advisers conduct\u201d would raise concerns about their own fiduciary duties to those they represent.\n\nISS did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nLast month BHP said its board would recommend shareholders oppose the resolution at its annual general meetings in London on Oct. 17 and in Sydney on Nov. 7.", "description": "The Church of England Pensions Board urged shareholder advisors on Wednesday to support a resolution asking the world's biggest listed miner BHP to leave groups which lobby for policies inconsistent with global climate change limitation goals.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
