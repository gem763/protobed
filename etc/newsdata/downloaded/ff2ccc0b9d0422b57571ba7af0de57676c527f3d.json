(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nDuring special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation, the cry from Republicans was that there had been \u201cno collusion.\u201d Aside from the fact that collusion is not a crime (conspiracy is the crime), they meant there was no evidence that then-candidate Donald Trump picked up the phone, called Russian President Vladimir Putin and asked him to have damaging emails against his opponent released. That sort of smoking gun did not exist, but at least they acknowledged that such conduct would be illegal and/or impeachable.\n\nNow, there is replete evidence that President Trump called up the Ukrainian president and asked him to find damaging information, even if none existed according to every investigation already undertaken, on his opponent\u2019s son. If the facts are as the Wall Street Journal reported, we have the smoking gun of collusion, conspiracy and a \u201chigh crime & misdemeanor.\u201d Now Trump says he can say anything to a foreign leader. Republicans are largely silent.\n\nThe media start throwing out chum, \u201cWell, this sure reopens the Hunter Biden thing!\u201d No, it doesn\u2019t. But it does reveal the degree to which Republicans and the media have contributed to the survival of a lawless president.\n\nSo in case you thought there would never be a time that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) would call for impeachment, consider her Dear Colleague letter on Sunday. \u201cIf the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,\u201d Pelosi wrote. She\u2019s getting closer, for she and many other Democrats understand that the action in question here is far more egregious than anything Mueller turned up with regard to Russia.\n\nAnd in case you thought House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) would never touch impeachment, take a look at what he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d:\n\nJAKE TAPPER: If the president did, in fact, in that phone call push the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden and Joe Biden eight times, as The Wall Street Journal reported, is it an impeachable offense, in your view? SCHIFF: Well, Jake, you know I have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment, for the reason that I think the founders contemplating, in a country that has elections every four years, that this would be an extraordinary remedy, a remedy of last resort, not first resort. But if the president is essentially withholding military aid, at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, that is, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents. We\u2019re going to hear from the director of national intelligence on Thursday why he is the first director to withhold ever a whistleblower complaint. And we are going to make sure that we get that complaint, that whistleblower is protected. And we're going to make sure that we find out whether the president has engaged in this kind of improper conduct. But it may be that we do have to move forward with that extraordinary remedy, if indeed the president is, at the same time withholding vital military assistance, he is trying to leverage that to obtain impermissible help in his political campaign. TAPPER: Well, that\u2019s certainly the farthest I have ever heard you go when it comes to the possible need for impeachment.\n\nYou might have thought not a single Republican would ever show daylight between himself and Trump. There were, however, a few bright spots. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) declared, \u201cIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out.\u201d (Nevertheless, both Rudy Giuliani and Trump have made admissions that seem to say exactly this.) Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) likewise weighed in: \u201cLook, it is not appropriate for any candidate for federal office, certainly, including a sitting president, to ask for assistance from a foreign country. That\u2019s not appropriate. But I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s what happened here.\u201d Well, that\u2019s not a rousing call for justice to be done, but it is a start. (Since Trump seems to be stipulating to the facts \u2014 he raised Hunter Biden on a call with Ukraine\u2019s president \u2014 it might be hard for these Republicans to escape the conclusion that Trump has crossed a bright red line.)\n\nNow, as irresponsible as it has been for some in the media to suggest \u2014 despite multiple investigations \u2014 that there is wrongdoing or potential wrongdoing on both sides, we are seeing many in the press rebuke the Trump propaganda, reiterating that the facts and the timeline do not support any allegation of wrongdoing by former vice president Joe Biden. ABC New\u2019s Martha Raddatz, CNN\u2019s Tapper and virtually the entire CNN \u201cState of the Union\u201d panel rebutted in real time Republicans\u2019 suggestion of wrongdoing on Biden\u2019s part.\n\nYou might have thought Democratic presidential candidates would never stand up to Trump on his deflection, false accusations and misdirection. However, not only did Biden himself take on a reporter who tried the \u201cboth sides\" hooey, but also his campaign went on the offensive. (His deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield sent out an email to the media: \u201cAny article, segment analysis and commentary that does not demonstrably state at the outset that there is no factual basis for Trump\u2019s claim, and in fact that they are wholly discredited, is misleading readers and viewers.\u201d)\n\nFinally, in case you thought there would never be a time that the Democratic presidential candidates linked arms to denounce Trump\u2019s solicitation of help from a foreign power, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) as well as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg all denounced Trump and directly or indirectly called for impeachment.\n\nI grant you there are still reporters and columnists, as well as mainstream outlets, that insist \u201cthis really could hurt Biden\u201d or \u201cyou know there\u2019s an issue here with Biden\u201d and the overwhelmingly number of Republicans (including the secretaries of state and treasury) are carrying Trump\u2019s dirty water, but we see, already, progress in clarifying what is at issue (Trump asking Ukraine to come up with dirt on his opponent) and the seriousness of the offense (the very definition of a high crime and misdemeanor), the lawlessness of Trump bottling up the whistleblower complaint and the necessity, if impeachment is to have any meaning, of pushing forward on this issue. Now the media must press each and every Republican as to whether they will defend Trump going to a foreign power for help in his reelection campaign.\n\nCongress, the responsible media outlets, Democrats and those Republicans not entirely under Trump\u2019s spell must keep up the drumbeat of facts: If Trump did what news reports say he did, impeachment is a necessity.\n\nRead more:\n\nJames Downie: Begin impeachment hearings now\n\nKaren Tumulty: Yes, there is something the House can do to punish Trump right now\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: What did Trump tell Ukraine\u2019s president?\n\nGeorge T. Conway III and Neal Katyal: Trump has done plenty to warrant impeachment. But the Ukraine allegations are over the top.\n\nAnne Applebaum: Welcome, Americans, to the Ukrainian swamp\n\nJennifer Rubin: Americans have a right to know if the GOP actually thinks Trump\u2019s conduct is acceptable", "description": "We must keep up the drumbeat of facts.", "authors": ["Jennifer Rubin", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Policy", "Foreign", "Opinion Writer", "September At Am", "Jennifer Rubin Writes Reported Opinion For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/n6R90XZxRjKxljl2768COHoRoMQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FWYN5BW34YI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
