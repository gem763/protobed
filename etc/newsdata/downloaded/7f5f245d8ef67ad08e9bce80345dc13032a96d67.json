Getting past the stigma of miscarriages\u201d for CBS News on Tuesday, said she vividly remembers standing on the ridge of a scorched hill in Yosemite National park in July 2017 when she began to feel stabbing pains.\n\nNEWS ANCHOR DIAGNOSED WITH MOLAR PREGNANCY, UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY\n\nShe said after a 45-minute trek up the hill, rather than feel accomplished, she was cringing in pain near the C-section scar left by the birth of her son. She was nine weeks pregnant and hadn\u2019t told any members of her crew, leading one to suggest she \u201cmust have eaten a bad burrito for lunch or some bad Mexican food on the way here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always remember those words, uttered by a co-worker who had no idea I was pregnant,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI knew if I told any of the men on that crew what I was going through, they wouldn\u2019t understand. I\u2019d get that look \u2013 \u2018Oh, you poor woman\u2019 \u2013 and then word would get back to my managers. So I kept everything to myself.\u201d\n\nShe said due to her location, there were no bathrooms nearby and she knew she was heavily bleeding.\n\n\u201cThere were no bathrooms close by and I was worried I\u2019d bleed through several layers of clothing and then everyone would see the pain I was going through on my bright yellow fire-retardant suit. But it didn\u2019t, and for that, I\u2019m thankful,\u201d she wrote.\n\nVillarreal said that her thoughts were racing as to whether she could save the baby or even get a doctor on short notice before her thoughts turned to wondering if she had caused it to happen and if it was her fault.\n\n\u201cIn my line of work, the facts are all that matter,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut for some reason, in this situation, finding data and stats wasn\u2019t easy. Blaming something or someone for the loss isn\u2019t that simple. Sometimes, your body can\u2019t handle the pregnancy. Sometimes it\u2019s chromosomal abnormalities with the fetus. Food. Trauma. Stress. Sometimes there is no explanation \u2014 it just happens.\u201d\n\nAccording to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), anywhere from 10 to 25 percent of all clinically recognized pregnancies will end in miscarriage, with the most occurring during the first 13 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAFTER MISCARRIAGES, WOMAN DISCOVERS CONDITION WAS GIVING UTERUS 'AN ACID BATH'\n\nDespite knowing this and discussions with her doctor, Villarreal said she couldn\u2019t help but blame herself for putting her body through a grueling work schedule while pregnant. She said she felt \u201cashamed and guilty,\u201d and blamed herself \u201cthen and still do.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy ambition and selfishness led to this miscarriage,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNo doctor will ever convince me that\u2019s not true. And that\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nVillarreal said it was months before she could bring herself to seek help through therapy to deal with the emotional toll the loss had taken on her, and that talking about it with other women has also helped her.\n\nShe and her husband began trying for another baby again, and she said she has suffered two more miscarriages over the last eight months.\n\n\u201cEach time I\u2019ve been on the road for work. And each time I go through one of them, the same feelings I had during the first miscarriage resurface,\u201d she wrote.\n\nVillarreal said that during a recent interview with Alanis Morissette, who has also had several miscarriages, the two talked about how the heartbreak hasn\u2019t deterred them from wanting more children.\n\n\u201cSomeone recently told me, \u2018Why can\u2019t you just be happy? Some women never get to have kids. Can\u2019t you be happy with what you have? Isn\u2019t it enough?\u2019\u201d Villarreal wrote. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: No, it\u2019s not enough. And it\u2019s okay to say that. It\u2019s okay to want more for whatever reasons you may have.\u201d\n\nVillarreal, who said she would go \u201cthrough 100 more miscarriages if it meant having another child like my 3-year-old\u201d said she is still working on forgiving herself.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThrough therapy, I\u2019ve realized that grieving the loss of this child was important, no matter what stage of the pregnancy I was in,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut forgiving myself is just as important and something I\u2019m still working on.\u201d\n\nVillarreal\u2019s essay comes days after another journalist, NBC News 3 Las Vegas\u2019 Michelle Velez, opened up about her molar pregnancy and cancer diagnosis. Both women shared their stories during National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month, which is honored every October.", "description": "She said she is still working on forgiving herself and that talking to women about pregnancy loss has helped her heal.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/mireya-villareal-CBS-News.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
