(AP) - A weekend news anchor and TV reporter in Portland, Oregon, is doubling down on her preference for high-waisted pants after a male viewer told her to \u201cdress like a normal woman\u201d in a message sent to her Facebook work account.\n\nMaggie Vespa, who works at Portland\u2019s NBC affiliate KGW-TV, posted photos of herself wearing a different pair of high-waisted pants on five separate news casts over the weekend because she wanted to draw attention to the pressure that women who work in the public eye face daily.\n\nVespa, a nine-year veteran of broadcast journalism, also delivered an on-air commentary about the remarks on Sunday\u2019s late-night news with the support of her managers, she said in a phone interview Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a pretty secure person but 10 years ago this would have rattled me,\u201d she said. \u201cI probably would have stopped wearing whatever that guy was criticizing and I would have gone out there with my minuscule paycheck and tried to buy some more clothes and tried to adjust. I remember that time, and I just thought if someone is starting out and getting comments like this, me calling it out for what it is might make it easier for them.\u201d\n\nVespa said she received two messages from the viewer before blocking him. She declined to identify the person by name and a video segment accompanying her on-air commentary blacked out the name as well.\n\nIn one, he said she looked ridiculous in pants that \u201cride half-way up your torso.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease change your wardrobe. You\u2019re way too pretty to look so foolish,\u201d the viewer wrote.\n\nShe replied to him and said she would not change her attire, prompting the viewer to write back while she was on the air live on Friday. In that message, he wrote, \u201cOMG you really looked uncomfortably (sic) tonight. Try dressing like a normal woman. Doesn\u2019t KGW pay you enough for a wardrobe makeover?\u201d\n\nHer male co-workers were shocked, she said, but this kind of incident is not new for women who work on TV.\n\nVespa said she shared the comments with her mother, who also worked as a news anchor in Peoria, Illinois.\n\n\u201cShe talked about getting horrible, toxic comments from people and unbelievably sexist things that make this look pale in comparison,\u201d Vespa said. \u201cSo I just thought, \u2018Let\u2019s say something.\u2019\u201d\n\nVespa covers Portland\u2019s homelessness crisis for KGW and works as the station\u2019s weekend news anchor.\n\n___\n\nFollow Gillian Flaccus on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/gflaccus\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A weekend news anchor and TV reporter in Portland, Oregon, is doubling down on her preference for high-waisted pants after a male viewer told her to \"dress like a normal woman\" in a message sent to her Facebook work account.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gillian Flaccus"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
