REUTERS/Amir Cohen\n\nThe centrist Blue and White party headed by former armed forces chief Benny Gantz has plastered Arab towns with campaign posters.\n\nGantz has appeared on Arabic language television, hoping to capitalize on the growing number of Arab voters ditching Arab parties in favor of other challengers.\n\n\u201cThis is a change in strategy from the previous election,\u201d said Ram Ben-Barak, a Blue and White candidate and former deputy director of the Mossad intelligence agency who is leading the campaign to woo Arab citizens.\n\nBlue and White is currently polling neck-and-neck with Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud party and its allies.\n\nArabs make up 21 percent of Israel\u2019s population.\n\nBut frustration with disunity among Arab-dominated parties and dismay over what they see as Israel\u2019s discriminatory practices against them helped push the community\u2019s turnout to a 20-year low in the last parliamentary election in April.\n\nNetanyahu failed to form a governing coalition after that race, leading to a new election.\n\nMore than 28 percent of Arab voters cast ballots for mostly-Jewish party lists in the April election, up from about 17 percent four years earlier, according to Arik Rudnitsky, a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute.\n\nMost of those votes went to Blue and White and the left-leaning Meretz party, data showed. Ben-Barak says the extra votes will help limit right-wing gains.\n\n\u201cIt will still serve Blue and White if they vote for others but will serve twice if they vote for us,\u201d Ben-Barak said.\n\nDISCRIMINATION\n\nMost Arabs still vote for parties led by members of their community, which comprises mainly of descendants of the Palestinians who remained in their homes or were internally displaced after the 1948 war that surrounded Israel\u2019s creation.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s announcement on Tuesday that he plans to annex the Jordan Valley drew condemnation from Arab lawmakers, who regularly speak out in support of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War.\n\nAyman Odeh, who leads the Joint List coalition of four mostly Arab parties, said Netanyahu\u2019s pre-election pledge is part of his \u201cright-wing apartheid vision\u201d which consists of \u201cerasing the civilian status of the Arabs in Israel\u201d and \u201cannexing the (Palestinian) territories.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the bid to win Arab votes, Gantz\u2019s Blue and White has given no indication it was trying to differentiate itself from Netanyahu on this issue.\n\nGantz told Army Radio on Thursday: \u201cI am in favor of leaving the valley in Israeli hands in any possible scenario.\u201d\n\nIndeed, annexation does not factor heavily into the Arab minority\u2019s political agenda, which focuses on issues of discrimination, inequality and crime in their own communities, according to the Konrad Adenauer Program for Jewish-Arab Cooperation.\n\nDespite holding Israeli citizenship, many Arabs say they face discrimination in areas such as health, education and housing. Poverty among Arab citizens is 47 percent, compared with a national average of 18 percent, according to Israel\u2019s National Insurance Institute.\n\nThe Mossawa Center rights group says Israel\u2019s state budget often favors Jews, allocating more funds to Jewish localities, schools, and institutions than to Arab ones.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s Likud party counters that its 15 billion shekel ($4.2 billion) \u201cis more than any government has ever invested in the Arab society,\u201d according to Eli Hazan, Likud\u2019s foreign affairs director.\n\nVOTER INTIMIDATION\n\nIn a rallying cry to right-wing supporters on election day in 2015, Netanyahu famously declared that Arabs were flocking to polls \u201cin droves\u201d to defeat him.\n\nArab turnout fell by a third to 49 percent in April\u2019s election, the lowest since 1999, the Israeli Democracy Institute said. Overall turnout was about 69 percent.\n\nLikud sent election monitors equipped with body cameras to Arab polling stations during that contest, alleging voter fraud in what Arab politicians called an attempt at voter intimidation.\n\nNetanyahu failed on Wednesday to pass a bill which would allow cameras in all polling stations next week. As the measure was debated on the Knesset floor, Odeh pulled out his cellphone and appeared to begin filming Netanyahu inches from his face, getting the lawmaker kicked out of the chamber.\n\n\u201cNo prime minister has incited against Arabs like Benjamin Netanyahu,\u201d Odeh told Reuters at a campaign event in Tira, an Arab village in central Israel.\n\nThe Joint List ran on two separate tickets in April and saw their total representation in the 120-member Knesset fall from 13 to 10. This time, the Joint List has reunited in a bid to increase turnout.\n\n\u201cIf we vote 65 percent and above, we will beat Netanyahu and the right-wing government,\u201d Odeh said.\n\nDIFFERENT APPROACH\n\nOdeh in August said he would join a center-left coalition -but only under a series of conditions, including resuming peace talks with the Palestinians and cancelling a law passed last year which declared Israel the \u201cnation-state\u201d of the Jewish people.\n\n\u201cWe refuse to join any government that treats us as second-class citizens in our homeland,\u201d Odeh said.\n\nBut no Arab party has ever served in a governing coalition, meaning they have little say in shaping Israeli policies. With most Israeli parties having ruled out forming a coalition with Arab parties, some Arab lawmakers are advocating a different approach to having their voices heard.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a psychological barrier to being in government,\u201d said Issawi Frej, an Arab politician in the left-wing Meretz party, which has joined the Democratic Union list backed by former prime minister Ehud Barak.\n\nFrej has struck a chord with some Arabs who say they are tired of being expected to vote only for Arab parties that have little prospect of joining a ruling coalition.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\n\u201cI am tired of engaging in identity politics,\u201d said Moataz Samara, an Arab citizen from Tira who has supported the far-left mostly-Arab party Hadash, which is part of the Joint List coalition.\n\n\u201cWith Meretz, it doesn\u2019t matter if your name is Moshe, Mohammad, Elias, or anything else,\u201d said Samara, 25. \u201cChange will only come if we engage and think differently\u201d.\n\n(This story corrects to add dropped words in paragraph 33)", "description": "Challengers to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in next Tuesday's election have courted Israel's Arab minority, hoping that a strong turnout from this unlikely source could tip the scales in their favor.", "authors": ["Rami Ayyub", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429174880&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1W2", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
