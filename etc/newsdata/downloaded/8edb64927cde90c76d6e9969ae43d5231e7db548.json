Varadkar insists it must remain fully open once Britain leaves the bloc.\n\nThe survey put Fine Gael on 29%, four points ahead of its nearest rival Fianna Fail with the left wing Sinn Fein a distant third on 14%.\n\nThe two big parties are closely matched in most polls, increasingly the likelihood that whoever edges ahead at the next election will lead another minority government.\n\nVaradkar\u2019s popularity had slid in successive Ipsos MRBI polls since it hit 60% in January 2018 after an initial Brexit breakthrough, the highest mark any leader had achieved since Ireland\u2019s financial crisis a decade ago damaged trust in its politicians.\n\nAt 51%, Varadkar was by far the most popular leader in the poll with Fianna Fail\u2019s Micheal Martin his closet rival on 38%.", "description": "Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's approval rating has jumped sharply as voters back his government's approach on Brexit ahead of a parliamentary election he wants to hold in May, a poll showed on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441023901&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0FH", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
