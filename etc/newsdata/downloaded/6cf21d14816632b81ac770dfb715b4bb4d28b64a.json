The robot will relay what it sees and senses in real time.\n\nANA sees the new technology as offering remote travel among other opportunities, also including keeping in touch with aging parents living far away.\n\nIn a demonstration, an ANA cabin attendant remotely controlled one of the stick-shaped robots, with the attendant's face shown on a tablet computer attached to it.\n\nDeNA Co and JapanTaxi Co are also taking part for the first time as providers of next-generation mobility services amid the rising popularity of ride-sharing and hailing.\n\nAmong major electronics manufacturers, Sony Corp has decided to come back to the event for the first time in six years but will not demonstrate its TVs, games or other entertainment products.\n\nIts booth is dedicated solely to its technologies related to the healthcare sector, such as microscopes capable of showing three-dimensional images and displays to be used in surgery rooms.\n\nSharp Corp. is focusing its presentation on internet-connected appliances, including displays, washing machines, and refrigerators, in the hope of forging new cross-industry alliances.\n\nSharp said it hopes to sell its analysis of customer usage patterns to service providers.\n\nMajor construction companies including Taisei Corp and Shimizu Corp have also joined the trade fair at a time when the sector is increasingly relying on new technologies to cope with a labor crunch.\n\nThis year's expo also sees 250 foreign exhibitors from 24 countries and regions, including China, the United States and India, up from 206 from 19 countries and regions last year, according to the organizers.\n\n\"We hope a lot of companies will gather for an innovative collaboration as social issues are becoming increasingly difficult to resolve by one company or one industry alone,\" said Kiyoshi Shikano, executive vice president of the Japan Electronics Show Association, one of the organizers of CEATEC.\n\nA total of 787 companies and organizations are gathering at the show this year, up from 725 last year, with 160,000 people expected to visit, up from 156,063.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Airline ANA Holdings Inc is among the newcomers this year at a major electronics show that kicked off near Tokyo on Tuesday aiming to encourage cross-industry collaboration in efforts to tackle common social challenges such as Japan's labor shortage and aging population.
