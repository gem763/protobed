So what we are saying is that a similar pattern on this unbundling and re-intermediation that happened with the internet, a similar pattern will happen with value exchange, which is at the end further and unbundling reintermediation,\" the analyst said.\n\nMeanwhile, in their latest report on blockchains, Gartner claims that we\u2019ll have to wait another five years to a decade to see a transformational impact that will have been made by these technologies.\n\nThe possible timeline goes like this:\n\n2019: Blockchain is sliding into the Trough of Disillusionment, as experiments and implementations fail to deliver, leading to less interest in the technologies and markets. \u201cBlockchain technologies have not yet lived up to the hype and most enterprise blockchain projects are stuck in experimentation mode,\u201d Avivah Litan, analyst and research vice president at Gartner, says.\n\nBlockchain is sliding into the Trough of Disillusionment, as experiments and implementations fail to deliver, leading to less interest in the technologies and markets. \u201cBlockchain technologies have not yet lived up to the hype and most enterprise blockchain projects are stuck in experimentation mode,\u201d Avivah Litan, analyst and research vice president at Gartner, says. 2021: The technology advances and practical use cases supported by blockchain keep coming out, pushing the market to start its climb out of the Through.\n\nThe technology advances and practical use cases supported by blockchain keep coming out, pushing the market to start its climb out of the Through. 2023: Blockchain platforms become scalable, interoperable, and support smart contract portability, cross chain functionality, and trusted private transactions, while permissioned blockchains gradually integrate with public blockchains. \u201cAll together, these technology advances will take us much closer to mainstream blockchain and the decentralized web, also known as Web 3.0,\u201d says Litan.\n\nBlockchain platforms become scalable, interoperable, and support smart contract portability, cross chain functionality, and trusted private transactions, while permissioned blockchains gradually integrate with public blockchains. \u201cAll together, these technology advances will take us much closer to mainstream blockchain and the decentralized web, also known as Web 3.0,\u201d says Litan. 2028: This is the year by which blockchain is expected to enable \u201ca digital business revolution across business ecosystems\u201d by becoming \u201cfully scalable technically and operationally,\u201d as Litan explained.\n\nHype Cycle for Blockchain Technologies, 2019\n\nSource: Gartner\n\nHowever, for blockchain to become mainstream, Gartner says they can\u2019t rely on users having enough technical knowledge to choose the best aspects of a blockchain for themselves, and they must have the issue of interoperability between different blockchain platforms resolved. In September, Gartner already warned that interoperability issues and other factors may hinder financial companies hoping to deploy blockchain solutions over the next three to five years.\n\nAdding to this, Chesini discussed the four key interconnected impediments for financial service industries, as presented in the report \u2013 the first two concerning governance, and the latter two interoperability and integration:", "description": "In the light of the recent report by research and advisory company Gartner, which claims it\u2019ll take another five to ten years to see the transformational impact of blockchains, the company\u2019s Senior Director Analyst, Fabio Chesini, said that the pattern we are now witnessing with blockchain is similar to that of the Internet\u2019s development.", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5d9/ddd26bd34d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
