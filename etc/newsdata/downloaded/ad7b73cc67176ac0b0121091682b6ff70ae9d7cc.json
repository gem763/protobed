It\u2019s not, I have to admit, quite as miraculous as the story a friend of mine told me about driving along the road in Bhutan. There, the butterflies were so thick he had to use the windscreen wipers to see where he was going, but in the Transylvanian mountain meadows there is a frothy, dancing upper-storey to the long grass, extending it into a third dimension, flecks of colour moving continually a few feet in the air.\n\nThe grass is also alive with caterpillars. I sat in one place and counted how many I could reach in the circle around me. There were 13; brown and black-spotted hairy ones, some shiny green and some grey with yellow flecks.\n\nIt was a whole new world I\u2019d hardly thought of before that day, but it gave me a new resolution, not just to learn all our native butterflies, but what their caterpillars look like and feed on. The safest time to sow wildflowers and plant shrubs is in the next couple of months. The shrubs will have time to get their roots well established without the need for watering and many wildflowers need cold to encourage germination. Sow now and you\u2019ll have the best results.", "description": "Walking through the hay meadows in Transylvania this summer felt like a visit to a perfect place, not just for the wildflowers \u2013 the salvias, aquilegias and orchids \u2013 but for the butterflies you kick up with every step.", "authors": ["Sarah Raven"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gardening/2016/01/11/butterflies-flower-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpg", "published_at": "2016-01-11"}
