Silicon Valley is a bubble of leftist thought, Zuckerberg acknowledges this fact and wanted to do something about perceived and real bias carried out by his company.\n\n\u201cFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been hosting informal talks and small, off-the-record dinners with conservative journalists, commentators and at least one Republican lawmaker in recent months to talk about issues like free speech and discuss partnerships,\u201d Politico reported.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe dinners, which began in July, are part of Zuckerberg\u2019s broader effort to cultivate friends on the right amid outrage by President Donald Trump Donald John TrumpJudge schedules hearing for ex-Trump aide who refused to appear in inquiry READ: Army officer to tell investigators he twice reported concerns over Trump's Ukraine dealings Murkowski, Collins say they won't co-sponsor Graham's impeachment resolution MORE and his allies over alleged \u2018bias\u2019 against conservatives at Facebook and other major social media companies. \u2018I\u2019m under no illusions that he\u2019s a conservative but I think he does care about some of our concerns,\u2019 said one person familiar with the gatherings, which multiple sources have confirmed,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAs someone who has worked in conservative circles for nearly a decade, I knew these dinner parties were taking place. While I\u2019ve never been invited to attend, many of my right-leaning colleagues and friends have dined inside Zuckerberg\u2019s Palo Alto home. The gatherings were and are intended to promote intellectual diversity and a better understanding of Americans who exist outside of the elitist and leftist dominated coasts. This effort has been applauded by those who quietly knew about them and served as a way for the tech giant to better serve large swaths of its online community and audience.\n\nBut when these dinner meetings were exposed by the press, which painted the meetings as sinister and inappropriate given the invitees were, gasp, conservative, the left in Washington went ballistic. Online cancel culture, another bubble, immediately kicked in with \u201c#DeleteFacebook\u201d trending among leftists on Twitter.\n\nAs the outrage continued to grow, Zuckerberg released a statement encouraging dialogue and understanding, rather than groveling to leftist intolerance of differing ideas or ideologies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some press today discussing dinners I\u2019ve had with conservative politicians, media and thinkers. To be clear, I have dinners with lots of people across the spectrum on lots of different issues all the time. Meeting new people and hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning. If you haven\u2019t tried it, I suggest you do!\u201d Zuckerberg released in a statement.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s efforts to promote healthy conversations with people who have different points of view fell on deaf ears, again among the left.\n\nDuring congressional testimony in front of the House Financial Services Committee last week, democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOvernight Energy: Automakers group sides with Trump in emissions lawsuit | Latest on California wildfires | Walden won't seek reelection | Park Service scraps plan to charge protesters for security Hillicon Valley: FCC chief aims to ban Huawei, ZTE from federal program | DOJ to allow body cameras in joint task forces | Facebook workers push back over political ads Trump Jr. sending copies of 'Triggered' book to Romney, top Democrats MORE (D-N.Y.), infamously known as a member of the leftist \u201csquad,\u201d vilified Zuckerberg and demanded to know what he discussed with private citizens inside of his home.\n\n\u201cIn your ongoing dinner parties with far-right figures, some of who advanced the conspiracy theory that white supremacy is a hoax, did you discuss so-called social media bias against conservatives and do you believe there is a bias?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked.\n\nShe then smeared conservative news outlet The Daily Caller, without evidence, as \u201ctied to white supremacists.\u201d She then argued that because the outlet had been used as an outside fact checker, Facebook is also associated with white supremacists.\n\nThe correct answer to the congresswoman\u2019s first question about what was discussed at the dinners is, \u201cNone of your damn business.\u201d\n\nElected officials have no right to know who private citizens are having dinner with inside of an individual\u2019s home, not to mention what was discussed.\n\nThere are serious questions about Facebook\u2019s power, how it operates as a potential monopoly, the role the tech giant plays in promoting certain types of information during elections, how pieces are \u201cfact-checked\u201d by outside \u201cnews\u201d sources and how they handle the data of individuals who use the platform.\n\nThese are issues Republicans and Democrats can work together to address in a calm, thoughtful and tolerant way that actually protects American consumers. But the berating of Zuckerberg by the intolerant left, which ironically and falsely preaches \u201ctolerance\u201d as a principle, is highly alarming.\n\nZuckerberg, and powerful people like him, should actively reach out to those they disagree with. Not because they ultimately have to agree on everything, but because it fosters understanding and respect, which leads to a truer culture of real tolerance.\n\nAccording to their own standards, these kinds of conversations, no matter how disagreeable, are exactly the discussions the left should be promoting rather than condemning.\n\nPavlich is the editor for Townhall.com and a Fox News contributor.", "description": "Earlier this month, news broke that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been hosting \u201csecret\u201d dinner meetings with conservative media figures and activists, among other individuals, at his home in California.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/zuckerbergmark_04112018gn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
