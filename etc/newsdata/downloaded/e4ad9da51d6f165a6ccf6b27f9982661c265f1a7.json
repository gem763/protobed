Slice 8 small gherkins or cornichons lengthways and then add to the courgettes with 3 tbsp of the pickle brine from the jar. If you like, add a few pickled silverskin onions. Set aside for at least 30 minutes.\n\nChop 150g of cucumber, skin on, and put it into a food blender with 350g of bottled and skinned red peppers and 700g of assorted tomatoes. Process briefly, until you have a coarse textured pur\u00e9e.\n\nPour the soup into a bowl, cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.\n\nWhen the soup is cold, chop 3 tbsp of parsley leaves and stir in. Drain the courgettes and gherkins, reserving the juice and stir them into the gazpacho, or spoon over the top. If you like, add a little chopped chilli. Spoon the pickle juice from the courgette over the soup and serve. Enough for 2.\n\nThe trick\n\nThis soup is something to eat with bread and cheese for a light summer meal. To be at its best the soup should be served thoroughly chilled, by which I mean it will need a good hour or so in the fridge. You can help to chill it quickly by adding a little ice to the blender, though not so much that you dilute its fiery summer flavours. If you have a coarse mouli grater then use that in place of a blender. The texture will be nigh-on perfect.\n\nThe twist\n\nYou can use the soup as a sauce. Throw some shelled prawns into a shallow pan of sizzling butter, let them pop and splutter and take the short journey from grey to pink, then ladle in the gazpacho and its pickle juices. Alternatively, continue to use it as soup, but add some heat by introducing a few chopped green guindilla chillies \u2013 the sort that curl up at the end like a sultan\u2019s slippers.\n\nFollow Nigel on Twitter @NigelSlater", "description": "A vinegary spin on a chilled summer classic.
