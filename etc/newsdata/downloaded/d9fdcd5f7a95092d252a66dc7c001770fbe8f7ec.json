He's come from another league, he's young,\" Zaha told the BBC.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"There's this price tag that he has not put on himself, people have put that on him because of his performances, so you've got to give him time for him to reproduce that, it's not going to come like that.\n\n\"I have got nothing but faith in him, I've got confidence that he will produce the same thing that he did before, because we both play for Ivory Coast, I've seen the talent he's got, but not everyone sees it.\"", "description": "The Crystal Palace winger was linked with a move to Arsenal but the Gunners signed his Ivory Coast team-mate instead", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article17306826.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Newcastle-United-v-Crystal-Palace-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
