Hearts around Weatherfield have been broken into pieces as Sinead lost her battle with cancer and a grieving Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard) has taken their son Bertie away from it all on a trip to Scotland.\n\nThose left behind are at a loss over what they can do for the best but when Carla discovers Sinead\u2019s recipes for the beard oil company she had started up, she decides to keep it going for her. At first, Beth (Lisa George) jumps to the conclusion that Carla is trying to profit out of Sinead\u2019s idea and lashes out but Carla kindly explains that all of the profits will be going to Bertie so his mum can continue to provide him with a future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarla\u2019s heartwarming plan is certainly one to tug at the heart strings and there are more emotional scenes ahead as Daniel remains absent and continues to struggle with his monumental loss. Ken Barlow (William Roache) struggles to contact his son and worries about the state of mind he is in.\n\nAnd he has a good right as Daniel will eventually decide to not even attend his wife\u2019s funeral, leaving it down to Peter (Chris Gascoyne) to track him down and try and talk him round. But as things get too much for Daniel, he hits the bottle in a big way, putting his life at risk.\n\nAs Carla, Peter, Ken, Beth and everyone else rally round to make plans for Sinead\u2019s final goodbye, they all have Daniel and Bertie\u2019s best interests at heart.\n\nBut there\u2019s only so much they can do to help as Daniel struggles through a grief that could destroy him for good.\n\nOne to watch: Monday 4th November at 8:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Carla wants to ensure that Sinead lives on.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/04_11_coro_ken_beth_carla_2nd_ep_0-83f9_1571659091.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
