(Five Deep Expedition)\n\nHidden beneath the Fram Strait, a passage that separates Greenland and Svalbard, Norway, lies the deepest point in the Arctic Ocean, where the seafloor plunges about 18,209 feet. And now, American explorer Victor Vescovo has become the first person to ever reach it.\n\nThe diving feat also makes him the first person to dive to the deepest part of all the world\u2019s oceans.\n\nOn Aug. 24, Vescovo descended around to the bottom of the \u201cMolloy Deep,\u201d a frigid trench that sits 170 miles west of the Svalbard archipelago. To reach Molloy, Vescovo descended in a submersible called the DSV Limiting Factor about 40 to 50 miles out from the edge of an ice pack, according to a statement. After Vescovo\u2019s initial solo dive, the team dove twice more.\n\n\u201cIt was cold, of course, and we only had about six to eight weeks of pretty good weather per year to try it,\u201d Vescovo told Live Science. \u201cIn the winter, the dive site is covered in ice, and when it isn\u2019t, storms can be a problem.\u201d\n\nThe expedition was timed around the narrow weather windows that would have made it possible to dive into the Arctic and Southern oceans, he said. \u201cFortunately, the weather gods smiled on us this year.\u201d\n\nWith these latest dives, Vescovo and his team completed the \u201cFive Deeps Expedition,\u201d a mission to reach the bottom of all five of the world\u2019s oceans \u2014 an achievement filmed for \u201cDeep Planet,\u201d a documentary series that will air on the Discovery Channel later this year.\n\nHe previously descended to the deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean, the Southern Ocean, the Indian Ocean (where the team discovered a weird critter that looked like a living \u201cballoon on a string\u201d) and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn May, he broke film director James Cameron\u2019s record for the deepest solo dive into the Pacific. He descended 35,853 feet to the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest point on the planet and part of the Mariana Trench.\n\nVescovo said his favorite part of being in the deep was going where no one has gone before and \u201cbringing light to places that haven\u2019t seen it for millions of years.\u201d\n\nExploring the deep was a dream of Vescovo\u2019s ever since he was a little boy reading about the great adventures of 20th-century explorers.\n\n\u201cIf you have the right, gifted, passionate team of people and the tenacity to overcome setbacks, anything is really possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is still an enormous amount to explore for the first time in this world \u2014 it is just under the oceans.\n\n\u2014 Live Science\n\nRead more\n\nJames Cameron\u2019s epic dive to Challenger Deep\n\nLife in the ocean\u2019s darkest depths is even weirder than scientists thought.\n\nRare deep-sea creatures may use underwater chimneys to keep their eggs warm\n\nVolcanic eruption in the Pacific creates a new island", "description": "After descending to deepest point in the Artic last month, Victor Vescovo and his team completed the \u201cFive Deeps Expedition.\u201d", "authors": ["Yasemin Saplakoglu", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_njtGd5cJ7LlklU4lt1qnIqkJpk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RGLYEOWVP4I6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
