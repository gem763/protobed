No reconstruction is expected to start before 2021.\n\nSEE: The minutes that 'saved' the Notre Dame from total destruction\n\nThis file photo taken on 15 May 15 shows a protective net in the Notre Dame de Paris Cathedral during preliminary work one month after it sustained major fire damage.

It is a physical reality,\" said Christophe-Charles Rousselot, director general of the Fondation Notre-Dame, the charity that is overseeing the gathering of donations to the cathedral.\n\nWith regards to the spire, a late addition to the mediaeval cathedral designed by the 19th-century French architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc, many see it as an integral part of the building.\n\n\"It needs to be rebuilt as it was before,\" said Philippe Villeneuve, the architect in charge of restoring the cathedral, arguing that the sheer power of the spire integrated it with the mediaeval church.\n\nHis is backed by Viollet-le-Duc's descendants and, according to opinion polls, the French public.\n\nBut the government has left open the possibility of an international competition for architects to design something new.\n\nALSO SEE: Life after the Notre Dame: The world mourns iconic cathedral by posting 'before' pics\n\nPatrick Palem, expert of the heritage restoration, holds the head of a statue showing the face of French architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc as Saint Thomas, stored in SOCRA workshop in Marsac-sur-Isle near Bordeaux, one of the statues which sat around the spire of the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris and removed for restoration. (Georges Gobet/AFP)\n\n'I feel orphaned'\n\nExperts are also intensively researching the precise original architecture of the cathedral, so that when reconstruction begins it is as accurate as possible.\n\n\"Before 2010, we only have old-style surveys, plans that have been redrawn on numerous occasions which are very partial and very imprecise,\" said Remi Fromont, one of the architects responsible for the site who is working on drawing up accurate plans.\n\nAndrew Tallon, a Belgium-born scholar who died aged 49 in November 2018, carried out hugely valuable laser scans of the interior in 2010 that have proved an even more valuable legacy than he could have imagined.\n\n\"We know that we will have shortcomings. Not all the chapels were systematically scanned. There are still areas of doubt,\" Fromont said.\n\nIn the aftermath of the fire, private individuals and above all rich French corporations rushed to pledge hundreds of millions for the rebuilding of the cathedral.\n\nThere were concerns whether this funding would ever be realised.\n\nBut France's richest man Bernard Arnault in September signed a formal accord over his pledge of 200 million euros (about R3.25 billion at R16.27/Euro ), as did the Pinault family for their promised 100 million euros (about R1.62 billion).\n\nA signing on another 100 million promised by the oil giant Total is awaited in October.\n\nThe consortium of fundraising groups behind the drive believes that 800 million euros (about R13 billion) can be raised in total, with over 616 million euros (about R1 billion) now either transferred or pledged.\n\nBut lovers of the historic masterpiece, be they tourists, architecture buffs or worshippers, may have to wait some time before Notre-Dame becomes theirs again.\n\n\"I have felt myself orphaned, it is like being in mourning,\" said Michele Chevalier, 70, a regular at Notre-Dame who was at the service when the first evacuation took place.\n\n\"I still manage to pray, but it's not the same.\"\n\nPICS: Paris to totally transform the Eiffel Tower experience, here's how\n\nCarpenter apprentices work on a roof truss matching one of Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral's as part of their training at the \"Compagnons du Devoir\" in Gennevilliers on 3 October.
