The resulting feud \u2014 including the \u201cSharpiegate\u201d scandal \u2014 was indeed a distraction from more pressing matters of concern, specifically how to respond to the crisis unfolding on the Bahamas.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut it also raised a troubling question: What if weather prediction becomes political? Forget climate change for a moment; what if we could not agree about the daily weather?\n\nThe issue at stake goes beyond the morale of a federal agency, bureaucratic infighting or presidential buffoonery. A society must be able to collectively trust scientific information and government expertise. To understand why trust in government weather science is so important, we need to understand the history of the struggle for federal authority in weather forecasting and how Americans came to put their faith in their government weather service. While we may take weather forecasts for granted today, Americans 150 years ago had to learn that government forecasts and storm warnings were a trustworthy public good that could help everybody plan for the future and protect their lives and livelihoods.\n\nUntil the mid-19th century, weather predictions were rooted in local knowledge, almanacs and weather folklore. But meteorologist James Espy called for a more scientific approach, writing in his 1841 book \u201cThe Philosophy of Storms\u201d that he wished for \u201cthe death of superstition on this subject.\u201d Understanding weather patterns, after all, could mean the difference between starvation and survival if, for example, one had forewarning to shelter family and livestock in advance of a blizzard.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEspy was a man ahead of his time, however. It would take the advent of weather telegraph networks after the Civil War and a new federal commitment to protecting the public from weather-related risks to make Espy\u2019s vision a reality.\n\nIn 1870, Congress authorized the first federal storm warning system along Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast shipping routes, before extending short-term forecasting to other areas. Its supporters argued that \u201cthe signaling of storms \u2026 will, it is believed, mark a new era in our lake and coast navigation, and be the means of annually saving many lives and millions of dollars.\u201d Newspapers in the 1870s agreed, lauding the government weather service as \u201cby long odds the most popular national institution\u201d and \u201csuch a necessity of American life\u201d that stopping the service \u201cwould be a National calamity.\u201d\n\nLocated initially within the U.S. Army Signal Service, the weather service became a civilian agency when the Weather Bureau was created within the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1890. Short-term government weather reports and forecasts were fairly accurate because they used the telegraph to send observations of temperature, precipitation and barometric pressure from west to east faster than the storms could travel. The warnings greatly reduced the losses to the shipping industry, which had become a disastrously dangerous business.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNewspapers and periodicals reported the success of the new storm warning service in terms of lives and dollars saved. But it was much harder for the federal government to produce long-range forecasts. In this realm, government meteorologists had to contend with \u201cweather prophets\u201d like Henry Vennor for authority. Vennor rose to fame in the late 1870s for successful winter storm predictions using idiosyncratic methods, and he used this credibility to publish widely read almanacs and newspaper weather predictions. By tapping local knowledge and accessing popular media, charismatic weather prophets like Vennor made it difficult for government officials to demarcate their own scientific approach from what Weather Bureau Chief Willis Moore derided in 1904 as \u201cpseudoscience.\u201d\n\nTo win the so-called \u201cwar on the weather prophets\u201d and establish federal authority in weather forecasting, government officials had to establish a boundary between superstitious, traditional \u201cprophecy\u201d and modern, scientific \u201cforecasting.\u201d But that was a difficult task. Government weather officials had to teach the public to trust reliable short-term government forecasting and renounce the appealing but more speculative long-range weather prophecy. Civil servant forecasters encouraged the public to not be fooled by \u201cFake Weather Forecasts\u201d and urged the media to help advance their scientific work by \u201cdiscouraging and discountenancing the publication of weather predictions founded upon such baseless theories.\u201d\n\nSo tenuous was the authority of the Weather Bureau that even top government officials rejected the practice of forecasting with high uncertainty. In 1893, the secretary of Agriculture warned against issuing long-range forecasts that he feared would \u201cdegenerate, so far as precision and certainty is concerned, into the style of the ancient almanacs. \u2026 The real object of the Weather Bureau work is to state with more certainty what the weather will be tomorrow, or the next day.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut soon outreach to media combined with new forecasting methods, and meteorologists secured their roles as the official spokespeople for future weather. Although the bureau\u2019s authority over prediction remained open to criticism, by the time Willis Milham published his 1912 textbook \u201cMeteorology,\u201d the age of \u201cspeculation,\u201d he optimistically argued, was finally ending.\n\nOver the next decades, government weather forecasting advanced rapidly, thanks to new scientific theories about fronts and atmospheric waves, increased research funding during World War II, technical innovations in numerical weather prediction and computer-based modeling and the introduction of the probability of precipitation forecasts (e.g., 30% chance of rain) that we rely on today. After World War II, meteorology was a firmly established profession in both the government and private sectors.\n\nThe postwar boom in private consulting meteorology created a new challenge to federal authority: not from \u201cweather prophets\u201d but from commercial forecasting firms like AccuWeather (established in 1962), which repackaged freely available government weather data and sold it for a profit. Tensions over the public-private competition in weather forecasting culminated in the 1980s, when the Reagan administration tried to privatize the NWS.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Reagan\u2019s push failed, the politics of this competition remain potent. Trump nominated former AccuWeather CEO Barry Lee Myers to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (of which the NWS is a part). Myers cleared committee on a party-line vote, but he has not yet been confirmed. Although the spectacle of Sharpiegate has passed, the future of credible, public weather forecasts still hangs in the balance.\n\nSince the late 19th century, meteorologists who provide public weather services have had to remind both the public and the federal government of their value, establishing, as the 1953 report of the title put it, that \u201cWeather Is the Nation\u2019s Business.\u201d Their credibility has depended on both the scientific process by which they predict the weather and the ability to convey this information to the public without a political agenda.\n\nAs the effects of climate change continue to intensify and science frequently finds itself in political crossfire, today we must recognize the value of government weather science. If even weather becomes politicized, it will undermine the NWS\u2019s work and mission. We must continue to build trust and capacity \u2014 in government, and in local communities \u2014 to support and to act on information that protects lives, livelihoods and property.\n\nAD", "description": "Ensuring access to trustworthy government weather information saves lives and livelihoods.", "authors": ["Jamie Pietruska", "Zeke Baker"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/53i9S3fxiaBGV4ULphv-3ypOHW4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YNW7OHEWKBAD3NGD6TQ6THLX3I.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
