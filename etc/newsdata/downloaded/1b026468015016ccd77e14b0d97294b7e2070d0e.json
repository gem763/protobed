The abortion providers have now filed their certiorari petition (in Gee v. June Medical Services). With the briefing schedule having been extended over the summer, the Court will decide no earlier than October whether to grant the petition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe abortion providers in this case might come to regret what they are asking for.\n\nI\u2019m very pleased to see that the state of Louisiana has filed a conditional cross-petition for certiorari that challenges the widespread lazy assumption that abortion providers have \u201cthird-party standing\u201d to represent their patients\u2019 interests. As the cross-petition explains, this assumption that benefits abortion providers\u2014and that generates lots of abortion litigation\u2014is an aberration from the third-party standing rules that apply to everyone else.\n\nSpecifically, the ordinary rule governing third-party standing is that (1) the party seeking to establish third-party standing must have a close relationship with the person who possesses the right, and (2) there must be a hindrance to that person\u2019s ability to protect her own interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs to the first element: In this particular case, Louisiana explains, the doctor-patient relationship, far from being \u201cclose,\u201d is \u201cshallow, transitory, and, as to the issues in this case, rife with conflicts of interest\u201d: \u201cPlaintiffs oppose a health regulation intended to provide patients with a protection that Plaintiffs would not otherwise provide, against a factual backdrop showing that such protections matter.\u201d Indeed, the clinic in this case \u201chas a history of serious regulatory violations which the [Fifth Circuit] panel characterized as \u2018horrifying.\u2019\u201d (See pp. 11-13 for more details.) The conflict of interest, Louisiana argues, should disqualify the plaintiff abortion providers from asserting third-party standing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the second element: The \u201cwhole history of constitutional litigation over abortion shows that women can and do assert their own alleged rights in court.\u201d\n\n(The abortion providers, of course, might well have their own rights to defend, but they get a huge benefit in litigation by invoking the rights of their patients.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLouisiana\u2019s cross-petition is conditional in that Louisiana is asking the Court to address this issue of third-party standing only if grants the abortion providers\u2019 petition. I\u2019m pleased to see that the signatories on the cross-petition include experienced Supreme Court practitioners Gene C. Schaerr and Erik S. Jaffe as well as Elizabeth B. Murrill, Louisiana\u2019s excellent solicitor general.\n\nIf the Court were to grant the cross-petition and rule against the abortion providers on third-party standing, it could eliminate much of the abortion litigation that besets the federal courts.", "description": "As you might recall, in early February the Supreme Court, by a vote of 5 to 4, granted the request of abortion providers to block a Louisiana law on hospital admitting privileges from taking effect until the Court rules on their petition for certiorari seeking review of the Fifth Circuit decision below.
