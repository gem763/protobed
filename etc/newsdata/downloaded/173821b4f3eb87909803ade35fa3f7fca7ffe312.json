REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nResearchers from Duke University and the London Business School studied Trump\u2019s Fed-focused tweets, starting with his first one bemoaning Fed policy in April 2018, and the resulting price movements in the fed fund futures market. Traders use the futures contracts to take bets on where the Fed will set its benchmark lending rate.\n\nIn a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper titled, Duke\u2019s Francesco Bianchi and London Business School\u2019s Howard Kung and Thilo Kind found Trump\u2019s tweets lowered market-based expectations for the central bank\u2019s interest rate policy by a tenth of a percentage point.\n\n\u201cOverall, we find strong evidence that the consistent pressure applied by President Trump to pursue more expansionary monetary policy is manifested in the market expectations of a lower target rate, forecasting a steady erosion in central bank independence over the course of his presidency\u201d they said.\n\nThe researchers wrote that \u201ceven if President Trump does not directly influence Fed decisions, his political pressure can still affect policy indirectly by changing market expectations regarding the Fed.\u201d\n\nGiven that when the Fed does change interest rates, it typically does so in quarter-point increments, the tenth of a point effect on market expectations is significant, they said.\n\n\u201cOur findings suggest that market participants believe that the erosion to central bank independence is significant and persistent,\u201d they wrote.\n\nTheir finding contrasts with the results of two recent Reuters polls, one of American voters and the other of global economists, which found respondents saying they see little impact on the Fed from Trump\u2019s pressure.\n\nIn the Reuters Ipsos poll of voters released last week, it appears Trump\u2019s barrage of tweets blasting the Fed have been ignored by both Republicans and Democrats who largely see the central bank as neutral in its decisionmaking.\n\nThat conclusion was supported in a separate Reuters poll of economists in which 80% of respondents said they did not think the Fed is influenced by Trump\u2019s criticism.\n\nTrump has taken to Twitter several times in the last several days to voice his displeasure with the bank\u2019s policy move last week, when it lowered its targeted interest rate range to 1.75%-2.00% from 2.00%-2.25%. It was the second rate cut this year, taken as insurance against uncertainty arising from Trump\u2019s trade war with China that has been weighing on business investment and the overall outlook.\n\nLess than half an hour after that decision was released, Trump derided the Fed and its chair, Jerome Powell, saying they had \u201cNo \u2018guts,\u2019 no sense, no vision!\u201d", "description": "Interest rate futures traders believe the U.S. Federal Reserve will bow to President Donald Trump's persistent tweets pressuring the central bank to lower interest rates, and this poses a \"significant\" risk to Fed independence, according to research released on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433086407&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M217", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
