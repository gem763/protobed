California will get 50 percent of the royalty fees incurred from the project.\n\nThe ruling authorizes oil and gas development in 14 areas across Monterey and San Benito counties. Those areas would be subjected to controlled surface use stipulations. The plan estimates that up to 32 new oil and gas development wells could be built on the federal lands during the plan's lifetime.\n\nNo federal lease sales have occurred in California since 2013, when a court ruled BLM failed to consider the risks of fracking when it issued oil leases in Monterey and Fresno. The BLM has since conducted and filed new environmental impact studies on drilling in the area.\n\nEnvironmental groups harshly criticized the administration\u2019s decision and threatened to take legal action.\n\n\u201cThis reckless move is the toxic convergence of Trump\u2019s climate denial, loyalty to the oil industry and grudge against California,\u201d said Clare Lakewood, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cTurning over these spectacular wild places to dirty drilling and fracking will sicken Californians, harm endangered species and fuel climate chaos. We\u2019ll fight tooth and nail to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nThe BLM submitted the final plan to open up the acres in May.\n\nBLM can take requests from fossil fuel companies for plots to lease starting 30 days from now, after the appeal period has ended.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s drilling plans run directly counter to California\u2019s clean energy push, and the state's Attorney General Xavier Becerra Xavier BecerraTrump administration ends five-year oil and gas drilling moratorium in California Feds won't pursue charges against Sacramento officers who fatally shot Stephon Clark Overnight Energy: 17 states sue Trump over weakening of Endangered Species Act | Federal land agency chief releases 17-page recusal list | UN climate report warns of warming oceans, sea level rise MORE (D) criticized it for having an emphasis on fossil fuel use.\n\n\u201cIn California, we're already well on our way to energy independence and we're doing it in the smart way. This is 2019, not 1920. We don't need to jeopardize our health or our environment to develop the energy sources we need,\u201d Becerra said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia last fall committed to transitioning its electric grid to 100 percent renewable energy use by 2045.\n\nThis story was updated.", "description": "The Trump administration Friday announced it would make 725,000 acres of land in California\u2019s central coast open to oil and gas lease sales, ending a five-year moratorium.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/environment_oildrilling_102618istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
