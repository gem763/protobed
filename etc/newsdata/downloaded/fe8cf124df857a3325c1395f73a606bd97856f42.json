The prosecutor also said that the attacker had stated a desire to die.\n\n\u201cThe context of latent radicalisation\u201d and messages of exclusively religious character the attacker sent to his wife shortly before the crime were added factors, Ricard told a news conference.\n\nThe investigation also revealed contacts between the attacker and several individuals who are likely to belong to an Islamist Salafist movement, Ricard said.\n\nThe killer, 45, has been identified by officials only as Mickael H.\n\n\u2018DEADLY JOURNEY\u2019\n\nOfficials have not said explicitly there was a terrorism motive behind the attack, but handing a case to anti-terrorism prosecutors usually indicates a terrorism link is the focus of inquiries.\n\nIn response, the Prime Minister told weekly newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche he had ordered inspectors to review the procedures in place in the intelligence department of the police headquarters and anti-terror intelligence unit to detect signs of radicalisation among civil servants.\n\nEdouard Philippe also defended his interior minister Christophe Castaner who has come under attack from French opposition parties. The far-right National Rally and the centre-right Les Republicains on Saturday called for parliament to launch an investigation into the minister.\n\nCastaner said last Thursday that the attacker had exhibited no warning signs ahead of the deadly rampage.\n\nSecurity personnel is seen after an attack on the police headquarters in Paris, France, October 3, 2019.

A third police officer was killed in another office and an administrative worker died on the stairs.\n\nThe attacker was born on the French island of Martinique and had worked at the police headquarters for several years.
