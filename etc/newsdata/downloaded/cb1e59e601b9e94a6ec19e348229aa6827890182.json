In September, Facebook stated that it would postpone the Libra launch until U.S. regulators approve it.\n\nQuestioning regulators\u2019 ability to supervise Libra\n\nIn its response to Cleaver\u2019s request, the Department of Treasury noted that Libra must be compliant with Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) guidelines as well as Bank Secrecy Act requirements.\n\nThe Treasury questioned the ability of both U.S. and foreign regulators to supervise Libra and require corrective action, if necessary, further stating that these issues must be addressed prior to Libra\u2019s release. The Treasury added that it will monitor Libra and the cryptocurrency market in order to address possible regulatory gaps in tandem with the representative\u2019s office.\n\nIn a hearing yesterday before the House Financial Services Committee, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin said that the FSOC had already established a special working group to monitor Libra and the cryptocurrency sector. Mnuchin said that participant institutions in Libra may be one avenue through which FSOC regulates the project.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s testimony before Congress on Libra\n\nCleaver received the letter a day before Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before the House Financial Services Committee regarding Libra. At the hearings, Rep. Tim Mahoney asked Zuckerberg to commit to keeping Libra from all wallets that maintain lower standards of Know Your Customer and AML controls than those that Facebook is promising for its Calibra wallets.\n\nZuckerberg said, \u201cI can\u2019t sit here and speak for the whole of the Libra Association, but you have my commitment from Facebook.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg also assured the committee that Facebook will not launch Libra anywhere in the world without having satisfied U.S. regulators.", "description": "The U.S. Department of the Treasury said it will monitor Facebook\u2019s Libra stablecoin and associated wallet Calibra following a letter from Rep.
