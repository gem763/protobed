(Photo by Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images)\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Philip Lowe has weighed in on the news that Australia\u2019s top-paid CEOs are raked in $10 million or more each last year, saying it \u201cdisturbs\u201d him.\n\nWith Qantas CEO Alan Joyce taking home $23.87 million at the same time that Australian workers haven\u2019t seen a substantial wage increase, Lowe acknowledged that there were people in the community who think \u201cthey don\u2019t need these mega salaries\u201d.\n\nSlow wage growth remains a thorn in the side of the economy, with Lowe acknowledging that getting Australian workers pay rises is one of the most important objectives of the RBA.\n\nThe revelation that Qantas CEO Alan Joyce pocketed nearly $24 million last year unsurprisingly created something of a stir.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s an ungodly amount of money when compared to the wages of your average Australian \u2013 wages which haven\u2019t seen a decent lift in years. Even Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Philip Lowe has now slammed it.\n\n\u201cAs a regular Australian, it disturbs me. Some people who are paid extraordinarily high amounts of money and working Australians have relatively low wages and getting small wage increases, I think it\u2019s an issue for the society,\u201d Lowe told the Armidale Chamber of Commerce.\n\nJoyce wasn\u2019t alone. Former Macquarie Group CEO Nicholas Moore departed the business with just $21,000 less than Joyce took home. In fact of the top ten paid CEOs in Australia last year, not one received less than $10 million.\n\n\u201cThe community, they will say, well, they don\u2019t need these mega salaries,\u201d Lowe said.\n\nHe\u2019s right given that many in that community have been getting paid more or less the same as they were years ago. With the rising cost of living and the extraordinary cost of housing in some capital cities, it likely feels like even less.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say CEOs aren\u2019t doing a good job. Joyce, for example, has helped steer Qantas, a once-ailing national liability, into a huge profit-making enterprise. Moore, who took over Macquarie Bank at the height of the GFC has also left the business in far better nick than he found it.\n\nThe question Lowe poses, however, isn\u2019t regarding the ability of CEOs but rather a status quo that rewards the work of a few excessively while the pay of the vast majority of workers stagnates. If Joyce was to work for $8 million, for example, would he really be incentivised to work at a quarter of his capacities? Lowe, who is paid $903,000 a year, thinks it\u2019s doubtful. For the record, he says he refuses to be paid a performance-based salary.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a flat salary and I say to my board, look, don\u2019t consider performance, because you know, I\u2019m going to work as hard for you and for the people who show up regardless. Actually, I think a lot of people are like that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need the incentives, my incentive is to do a good job for the people.\u201d\n\nWhile some may be of a different mind, it stands to reason at some point pay incentives become subject to the law of diminishing returns. Where an extra million might not be missed by Joyce, a $10,000 pay rise to 100 Qantas workers could make a world of difference \u2013 both to the quality of the work they do, and the economy as well. A group of cashed-up workers is able spread their money across the economy in a way that a single CEO simply can\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue close to the RBA\u2019s heart.\n\nIt has long signalled that when it comes to getting Australia\u2019s economic cogs whirring again, the name of the game is wage growth. The main means the RBA has spelled out for doing so has been to get unemployment to 4.5% with wage growth presumed to follow. As more money ends up in the pockets of the everyday man and woman, they\u2019ll feel more inclined to spend it. That money, in turn, flows through the Australian economy, creating jobs in a virtuous economic cycle.\n\nThat\u2019s the idea anyway.\n\nThe problem with the RBA\u2019s equation is it can\u2019t get the first part right. Despite the creation of tens of thousands of new jobs, the number of people looking for work is at such a record high that it\u2019s not enough. Unemployment, instead of shrinking, is actually slowly rising as a result.\n\nREAD MORE: Australian unemployment has just shot up to a 12 month high \u2013 and it\u2019s the \u2018smoking gun\u2019 the RBA needs to cut rates in October\n\nThe RBA\u2019s principal means for accelerating the economy is to cut the official interest rate. Sitting at 1%, there\u2019s only so much lower that can go, while the recent two cuts appear to be doing little to get consumers spending. Instead, Australians appear either content to pay down the eye-watering level of debt they\u2019ve accumulated, or to jump into the property market, rising house prices \u2013 something the RBA specifically wants to avoid.\n\nSo the RBA has been desperately looking elsewhere for solutions. From petitioning the government to loosen the national purse strings to considering unconventional monetary policy such as quantitative easing, Lowe has been busy.\n\nThe latest conversation around CEO wages is just the latest throw. Lowe is certainly not suggesting a forceful redistribution of wealth, but he is talking about the economic folly of excessive pay accumulating at the top of the corporate ladder while it appears to be drying up at the bottom.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
