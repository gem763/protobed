Attempts by Moyo to gain access to his office have been blocked three times after he won two court orders to be reinstated. This has prompted the 56-year-old to lodge a contempt of court application against the company and board members, which Old Mutual has vowed to oppose as the spat drags on.\n\n\"All Weather is no longer confident that by pursuing the current litigation-orientated strategy the directors of Old Mutual are acting in the best interests of the company,\" Watkins wrote.", "description": "An Old Mutual shareholder is urging the  insurer to end its dispute with Chief Executive Officer Peter Moyo even if it means settling out of court.", "authors": ["Felix Njini"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9172/89a112b20d2e46d59e253c1ceea3ef3d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
