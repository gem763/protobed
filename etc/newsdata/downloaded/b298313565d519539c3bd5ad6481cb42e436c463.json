I agree that it was a bit of a rush. It felt like things weren\u2019t set up well enough.\u2019\n\nThe director called the final run of episodes \u2018rushed\u2019 (Picture: REX/HBO)\n\nNow, however, the filmmaker has backtracked on his comments. Speaking to NME, Marshall said that backlash to the final run of the show was inevitable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t necessarily think the backlash was justified,\u2019 the filmmaker continued. \u2018But it was unavoidable. I for one wouldn\u2019t fault [showrunners David Benioff and D.B Weiss]. It was an unbelievable achievement and ten years of their lives that they\u2019ve devoted to it.\u2019\n\nMarshall\u2019s career on the HBO epic was relatively short, he only directed two episodes, but they happen to be two of the best in the history of the show; second series highlight Blackwater and Lord of the Rings-esque The Watchers on the Wall during the fourth season.\n\nAs we all know by now, Thrones\u2019 last-ever run of episodes was divisive, to say the least.\n\nThe eighth instalment of the high-fantasy epic got a massive backlash from fans \u2013 from the lower episode count to the choices certain characters made, the general consensus was that the last eight episodes sprinted to the finish line with little care or love given to the show\u2019s central characters or how they ended up in their pre-determined fates in the final.\n\nThe criticism was so intense, that a petition to re-write and re-shoot season eight managed to accumulate a record-breaking one million signatures, although network HBO have categorically said the show will not be re-shot.\n\nOne hope left for fans, however, are the source books. Author George RR Martin still hasn\u2019t finished writing his high-fantasy epic, and has already spoken out about the \u2018traumatic\u2019 and unfaithful ending of the TV adaption.\n\nGame of Thrones seasons one to eight are available to stream on NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
