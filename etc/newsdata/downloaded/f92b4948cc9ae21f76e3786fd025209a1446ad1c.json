You also don\u2019t want them to worry about how to pay for yours when you\u2019re gone. Funerals are both emotionally and financially taxing, but the good thing is you can plan for the latter. To help you do so, here are some tips for what to keep in mind when choosing funeral cover.\n\nBE PROACTIVE\n\nIt\u2019s easy to put it off and think you\u2019ll get to it another time because it doesn\u2019t seem that urgent. But death is inevitable and often unexpected, so being prepared is key.\n\nRead more: 9 steps you can take when you can't afford your debt\n\nWHAT KIND OF SEND-OFF DO YOU WANT?\n\nHow much you can afford to pay every month is important, but you also need to think about how much cover you want. \u201cThe payout amount should be enough to cover all the funeral costs,\u201d says John Manyike, Old Mutual head of financial education.\n\n\u201cDecide what type of funeral you\u2019d like and find out how much it\u2019s likely to cost,\u201d says Craig Torr, director at financial planning company Crue Invest. There are a lot of expenses when it comes to funerals \u2013 from the coffin and undertaker\u2019s fee to the service itself, flowers, leaflets and catering. Costs vary widely \u2013 from R15 000 for a basic funeral to R200 000 for a lavish send-off, says Grant Kerr, a funeral advisor at Kerr\u2019s Funeral Directors. A basic funeral of R15 000 would cover grave fees, a coffin, 100 leaflets, flowers and the service, Kerr says. Grave fees range from R1 500 to R6 000 depending on the municipal gravesite you choose.\n\nChurches generally don\u2019t charge a fixed fee for a funeral service, but you\u2019ll need to make a donation, which is usually R500 and up. Lavish funerals can cost between R100 000 and R200 000, Kerr says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same process, but a lot more fancy.\u201d Torr says if you budget for funeral expenses of R20 000 \u201cdon\u2019t buy insurance in excess of this amount\u201d. Remember, the higher the payout you want, the higher the monthly premium.\n\nThe next thing you need to do is decide which dependants \u2013 children, parents, parents-in-law \u2013 you want to include on the policy and the level of cover you\u2019d like them to have. This will determine the monthly cost.\n\nRead more: \"I'm debt free and save 75% of my income - this is how I did it\u201d\n\nCOMPARING PLANS\n\nThese are the things to look at when shopping around for a funeral cover, according to Manyike and Torr:\n\nThe insurer\u2019s reputation in terms of claims payout and the ease of claiming If there are additional benefits offered, such as grocery vouchers, education benefits (school fees being covered for a certain number of months, for example) and assistance with funeral planning The number of people that can be covered on the policy Find out if you have the option to take a premium \u201choliday\u201d in the event of retrenchment or other times of financial stress and what the conditions are with regard to this Check if your cover increases every year so the payout keeps up with inf lation \u2013 but keep in mind this will mean your premium increases too If your policy promises you a cashback benefit, it\u2019s likely the premiums are inflated to cover the costs of this benefit. To ensure you\u2019re comparing apples with apples, ask the insurer to quote you on cover that excludes a cashback benefit", "description": "How to prepare for a debt-free final send-off for yourself and your loved ones.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9493/f2be6cd105024487ac9fbd04c88438d0.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
