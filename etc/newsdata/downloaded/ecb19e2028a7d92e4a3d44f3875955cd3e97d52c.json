Sign up here to have it in your inbox every Friday.\n\nHappy Friday,\n\nLet's dive right in. The spate of vape-related illnesses continues, with Missouri announcing the eighth death in the US on Thursday. The FDA is also launching a criminal probe into the matter, alongside the CDC's investigation. We're keeping you up to date on those developments here.\n\nIn other news, the embattled cannabis producer CannTrust had its growing license suspended by Health Canada, which regulates cannabis. The company has seen its shares drop more than 70% since the beginning of this year.\n\nWhat else?\n\nThe US House of Representatives is set to vote on the SAFE Banking Act next week, a bill that would allow cannabis businesses to access commercial banking services, as early as next week. The bill has faced opposition from civil rights and cannabis advocacy groups including the Drug Policy Alliance, who are calling on the vote to be delayed until social justice provisions are included.\n\nI also went to the Cannabis Private Investment Summit at the law firm Duane Morris's midtown Manhattan offices on Tuesday where we saw some of the same issues at play, albeit on the state level.\n\nNew York State Sen. Liz Krueger outlined the social justice case for legalizing cannabis in New York \u2014 in a room full of high net worth investors and cannabis execs \u2014 and laid out how limiting the number of licenses one company can possess in the state is crucial to her stated social justice goals. She also said she wants to provide a structure that would allow small, minority-owned startups enough access to capital to get their businesses off the ground.\n\nWe also scored a sit down with David Feldman, who leads Duane Morris's booming cannabis practice, and ex-Canopy Growth CEO Bruce Linton at the conference.\n\nWhile the cannabis legalization movement has the same broad goal \u2014 the legalization of cannabis \u2014 it's fraying into two sides: activists who want social justice considered above industry-friendly legislation, and the increasingly well-capitalized cannabis companies and investors on the other side. We'll be watching how this plays out.\n\nAs Feldman told me in his office overlooking Times Square this week, \"legislation is all about compromise.\"\n\n-Jeremy\n\nMore stories from around the BI newsroom:\n\nThe California cannabis company Canndescent has closed a $27.5 million Series C, led by Green Acre Capital. The funding round valued Canndescent at $200 million to $300 million, CEO Adrian Sedlin told me.\n\nIn an interview, Sedlin discussed the challenges of raising growth-stage capital in the cannabis industry.\n\nWe also got a hold of the deck Canndescent used to close a relatively large funding round in a tough environment for venture-backed plant-touching companies.\n\nNew York State Sen. Liz Krueger is spearheading the push to legalize marijuana in the state after her bill failed to earlier this year.\n\nKrueger leveled a stark warning against THC vape manufacturers at an exclusive Manhattan conference for cannabis investors. She also outlined how social justice efforts are crucial to passing cannabis reform in New York state. It points to deepening conflict between legalization advocates and so-called 'corporate cannabis.'\n\nBruce Linton, the former Canopy Growth CEO, is pursuing a number of new ventures, both inside and outside of the cannabis space.\n\nHe'll be taking on new positions as the executive chairman of Gage Cannabis Co., a Michigan dispensary chain; as a special adviser at Better Choice Co., a CBD-pet-food supplier; and as a director at Mind Medicine, a company developing psychedelic-based drugs for FDA approval.\n\nBusiness Insider caught up with Linton on the sidelines of the Cannabis Private Investment Summit in midtown Manhattan.\n\nCapital raises, M&A activity, partnerships, and launches", "description": "In this edition, we bring you an exclusive look at Canndescent's Series C deck, and get inside the room at the Cannabis Private Investment Summit.", "authors": ["Jeremy Berke"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8500402e22af07581437a3-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
