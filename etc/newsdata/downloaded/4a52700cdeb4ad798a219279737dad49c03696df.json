In 2016 more 20 euro notes were seized, while forged 50s were on the decline.\n\nThe EU\u2019s high-denomination notes have been criticised by some as providing organised crime with easy pickings, but the 500 euro note will be withdrawn in 2018 and traders are now wary and many refuse to accept notes over 50 euros. There is little evidence to support the claim the big notes have been a crime bonanza.", "description": "The ECB launches a new 50 euro banknote today claiming it will be harder to forge, and says evidence suggests Europe's single currency is proving hard for criminals to corrupt.", "authors": ["Robert Hackwill"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/362371/1000x563_362371.jpg", "published_at": "2017-04-04"}
