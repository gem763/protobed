Coach said at one point, it looked like we had six guys out there. So that\u2019s how we want to look.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhether they\u2019re giving the illusion of playing with a man advantage or just compensating for their youth and size by playing harder than the opponent, the Wizards are learning the style of new defensive coordinator Michael Longabardi. As one of the four assistant coaches added to the Wizards\u2019 staff, Longabardi will have one of the toughest jobs: transforming one of the most underachieving defenses in the NBA.\n\n\u201cWe want to take away every layup we can, so no layups. And no rhythm threes, especially from the strongside corner. And then we want to defend without fouling and the most important thing, we want to finish the possession with a rebound,\u201d Longabardi said during training camp, ticking off the major themes the Wizards want to implement in 2019-20. \u201cIf we can make that our staple, we have an opportunity to be in games and potentially win games and that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping to do.\u201d\n\nLongabardi, a two-time NBA champion as an assistant coach, orchestrated the 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 defense that surrendered only 98.3 points per game (fourth lowest in the league). The Cavaliers, who defeated the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals, also ranked in the top 10 with a 103.9 defensive rating, which indicates points allowed per 100 possessions. That statistic was created by Dean Oliver, a pioneer in the analytics movement as well as a new assistant coach on the Wizards\u2019 staff.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a winner. Everywhere he\u2019s been, he\u2019s won,\u201d Coach Scott Brooks said, explaining why he hired Longabardi. \u201cAt that time he seemed to be a perfect fit, now I know he is the perfect fit. He\u2019s good with us. He\u2019s definitely going to be a big part of our defense going forward but everybody\u2019s chipping in.\u201d\n\nBesides two championship rings \u2014 the other earned with the 2007-08 Boston Celtics \u2014 Longabardi has a stain on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, one he doesn\u2019t hide from.\n\n\u201cWe had the worst defense,\u201d Longabardi said bluntly, in reviewing the 2018-19 Cavaliers, his final year in Cleveland.\n\nLast season, the Cavaliers ranked last in opponent field goal percentage (. 495) and three-point percentage (. 380) as well as the league\u2019s worst defensive rating at 116.7. According to the statistical website Basketball-Reference.com, the Cavs\u2019 rating was the worst in the NBA dating back to the 1973-74 season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe reason behind this historically bad defense is simple, and also helps explain why the Wizards played so poorly a year ago. Injuries piled on Cleveland; the team lost its bedrock star, Kevin Love, and as time went on, more veterans left the lineup and the team finished with too many young and inexperienced players to remember.\n\nWhen examining Washington\u2019s defensive weaknesses from last season, Longabardi can see similarities.\n\n\u201cInjuries and continuity and change in lineup, those things are real and they can affect a team. So when you lose a guy like John Wall, who\u2019s out for an extended period of time, who is a two-way type player, that\u2019s going to be a big hit,\u201d Longabardi. \u201cJust witnessing that in Cleveland. Not having Kevin Love, having 35 different starting lineups, 29 guys on your roster. There\u2019s no continuity, which I think makes it difficult.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLongabardi can be forgiven for losing track of the conveyor belt of players \u2014 the Cavaliers actually had a league-high 32 different starting lineups and 27 players on roster. Now in Washington, Longabardi has to adapt to more evolving units.\n\nDue to injuries to five players, the Wizards\u2019 Oct. 23 opening night starting lineup could change in a matter of games. Also, the Wizards have eight players 24 years old or younger on roster and inexperience could impact the team\u2019s defensive acuity.\n\nEven so, the Wizards don\u2019t want to wield youth as an excuse \u2014 \u201cThe league waits for no one,\u201d Longabardi said \u2014 and instead, set small, short-term goals over the course of the season.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis week, let\u2019s make sure we become the best in limiting fast-break points,\u201d Longabardi said, sharing an example of one possible goal. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure our defensive rebounding percentage is above average versus the opponents coming up. Some goals will be realistic and some won\u2019t, so let\u2019s just try to keep it as realistic as possible.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFriday night\u2019s performance in New York was a first step in establishing a defensive personality. Washington started the game in a zone, held the Knicks to 29.4 percent from three and kept them under 100 points.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to do it collectively as a team,\u201d Longabardi said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to emphasis it as much as we can.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Under new defensive coordinator Michael Longabardi, the Wizards want to be a team that takes care of the simple things (like not allowing easy three-pointers) and build on achievable goals.", "authors": ["Candace Buckner", "National Basketball Association With An Emphasis In Covering The Washington Wizards."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8W6dZeur53FAqXwbEOehBqsGJzs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TQNGPFHMTAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
