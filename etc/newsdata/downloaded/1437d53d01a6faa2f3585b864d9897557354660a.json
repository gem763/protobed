Maverick\u2019s brother, Ryder, has had some difficulty breathing and didn\u2019t get to watch the game while getting healthy in the neonatal intensive care unit.\n\n\u201cMaverick has been spending all day with the wife, and as soon as I get back, I can\u2019t wait to head down and see the other one,\u201d Reddick said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get a progress report.\u201d\n\nReddick didn\u2019t sleep a wink on Wednesday night and missed Thursday\u2019s workout with the team to be with his family. But his wife handled baby duties on Thursday night so he could rest for his big day.\n\nThe outfielder said the last couple of days have been a \u201crollercoaster of emotions,\u201d but that it\u2019s been one of the best times of his life.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier that they\u2019re here and healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a game-changing experience. It\u2019s a different kind of love, a different step in our lives because I never thought I would be responsible for humans at any point in my life. It\u2019s definitely one of those feelings that you can\u2019t really prepare for. Here I am with two humans running around.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After Josh Reddick walked to get Houston's big fifth inning started in a win over Tampa Bay in Game 1 of the AL Division Series on Friday, he couldn't wait to run out of Minute Maid Park to see his new twin boys.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/alds_rays_astros_baseball_09135_c0-117-2801-1750_s1770x1032.jpg?58a2b44e9962e0d848ce7121e64981b390be1198", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
