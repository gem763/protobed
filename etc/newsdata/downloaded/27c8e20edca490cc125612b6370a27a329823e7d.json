If you\u2019re the kind of person who likes to ogle celebrities, you are in the right goddamn place.\n\nThe Biebers, who celebrated their latest nuptials on Monday at the Montage Palmetto Bluff resort in South Carolina, took to Instagram overnight with the goods. Observe:\n\nThen there was the all-star cast of friends and family, including Hailey\u2019s mates Kendall Jenner, Joan Smalls, Justine Skye, Renell Medrano, and Riley Montana.\n\nThen there were elements of the extended Jenner clan, including Kris Jenner, her partner Corey Gamble, Kylie Jenner, and Kylie\u2019s bub Stormi.\n\n(Swipe through for piccies of the wedding gift bags, which appear to have included Blu-Ray copies of The Notebook. As you do.)\n\nMr. Bieber\u2019s mates came through, too, with Jaden Smith, videographer Alfredo Flores, and security head honcho Mikey Arana making appearances in the official shots.\n\nSwish.
