Federal officials said Parnas and Fruman were arrested Wednesday evening at Dulles International Airport near Washington as they prepared to board an international flight with one-way tickets.\n\nTrump brushed aside several photographs of the men with Trump or members of his family. On May 21, 2018, Parnas posted a picture on Facebook of himself with Fruman and Donald Trump Jr. at a breakfast at the Beverly Hills Polo Lounge in California. \"Power Breakfast!!!\" the caption said. Parnas had previously posted a picture of himself with Trump at the White House on May 1, describing an \u201cincredible dinner and even better conversation.\u201d\n\nMore: Impeachment: Lawmakers subpoena Giuliani associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, hours after their arrests\n\n\u201cNow it's possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody,\u201d Trump said. \"Somebody said there may be a picture or something at a fundraiser, or somewhere, but I have pictures with everybody.\n\n\"I don't know them,\" Trump continued. \"I don't know about them, I don't know what they do...Maybe they were clients of Rudy. You'd have to ask Rudy. I just don't know.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s defense came as his campaign has been drawing attention to a photograph of Biden, his son Hunter and a Ukrainian oligarch to question the former vice president\u2019s assertion that he never discussed his son\u2019s business in Ukraine with him.\n\nHouse Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry to look into whether Trump improperly used the power of his office to further his own political aims by pushing Ukraine to investigate Biden. During a phone call on July 25 phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Biden but he has insisted there was nothing improper about the call.\n\nContributing: Kevin Johnson\n\nPresident Donald Trump answers questions from reporters during an event on More\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Donald Trump denies knowing Giuliani associates Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman", "description": "Donald Trump denied knowing two business partners indicted in connection with alleged schemes to funnel foreign money to U.S. political campaigns.", "authors": ["John Fritze", "David Jackson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vL3U_aY7NypfKlNHdAylBQ--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/d782883d632da0c4283be4206c0ce372", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
