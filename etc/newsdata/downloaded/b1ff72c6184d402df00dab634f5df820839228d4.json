Photos of drills conducted in the Chinese border town of Shenzhen have fuelled speculation that China might mobilise its military to crack down on protests in Hong Kong.\n\nPeople held by China on state security charges are often detained for months at an unknown location and are denied visits from lawyers and families.\n\nIn March 2017, Taiwanese rights activist Lee Ming-che disappeared on a trip to China and emerged in September at a court hearing in the southern city of Changsha. He was later sentenced to five years in prison for the \u201csubversion of state power\u201d for holding online political lectures and helping the families of jailed dissidents.", "description": "Lee Meng-chu from Taiwan held on state security charges after going missing weeks ago", "authors": ["Verna Yu"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a8645699299d03a84a52c0acf02b51921742987/284_429_2709_1624/master/2709.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0736f35b71bb62a4a104d49068dddba1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
