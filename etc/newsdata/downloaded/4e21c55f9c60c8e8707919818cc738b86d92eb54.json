And now the political world\u2019s on fire, seeing images of trees and dangling ropes and hanging blacks and so forth and so on, and drawing conclusions of this president\u2019s inherent racism and hatred toward blacks.\n\nOh, please. It\u2019s called figurative language, folks.\n\nIf lynching is offensive to Democrats, then witch hunt \u2014 another term used by Trump to describe the left\u2019s incessant call for impeachment \u2014 is offensive to pagans.\n\nThis is simply the Democrats\u2019 next way to create a wave of outrage they can ride all through the media, one click closer to taking down this White House.\n\nTrump tweeted this: \u201cSo some day, if a Democrat becomes president and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the president, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2014 a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d\n\nDemocrats decried. As they always do whenever this president speaks.\n\nRepublicans \u2014 the weaker ones, the political career ones, the ones who always want to run from bad press, rather than stand and fight \u2014 condemned.\n\n\u201c\u2019[Trump] never should have made that comparison,\u201d Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who\u2019s facing reelection, tweeted. \u201d \u2018Lynching\u2019 brings back images of a terrible time in our nation\u2019s history, and the president never should have made that comparison.\u201d\n\nWhy not?\n\nIt\u2019s done all the time.\n\n\u201cAt least 5 House Democrats compared Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment to a \u2018lynching\u2019 in 1998,\u201d The Washington Post wrote.\n\n\u201cFlashback: Jerry Nadler in 1998 Accused Republicans of Running a \u2018Lynch Mob\u2019 Against Bill Clinton,\u201d Breitbart wrote.\n\n\u201c\u2018Sham,\u2019 \u2018careless,\u2019 \u2018lynch mob\u2019: Texas Republicans rip Dems\u2019 impeachment push as they stand by Trump,\u201d Dallas News wrote in September, citing Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s characterization of the \u201cDemocrats\u2019 push to a \u2018lynch mob.\u2019\u201d\n\nFight the word censors.\n\nBite the word censors.\n\nHow come the Democrats can stand for the f-bomb being thrown in supposed polite society, as when incoming congressional members like Rashida Tlaib vow to \u201cimpeach the motherf\u2014er\u201d Trump \u2014 but can\u2019t stand for a literary use of a well-used descriptor like lynching?\n\nHow come Democrats, even campaigning-for-president Democrats like Beto O\u2019Rourke, can use words like Hitler and Nazi to describe this president \u2014 but can\u2019t stand for a literary use of a well-used descriptor like lynching?\n\nIt\u2019s all political show. It\u2019s all political bunk. And the American people shouldn\u2019t buy into the hypocrisy because, in the end, it all comes down to censorship.\n\nIf Trump wants to call the impeachment swirl that\u2019s been surrounding him since Day One \u2014 since before he even physically took office, at his Inauguration \u2014 and use descriptive words like witch hunt, or lynching, or fraud, well then, so be it.\n\nHe means one and the same \u2014 that the left has treated him over-the-top unfairly. What\u2019s more, Democrats know that.\n\nThey\u2019re just hoping to distract you from knowing they know that, and create the kind of furor that drums up animosity against this president. Elections are coming, and all the Democrats have to offer is a Hate Trump platform.\n\nBut think: Those on the left aren\u2019t upset about a word. Those on the left are furious Trump is president. So furious, in fact, that they\u2019re willing to walk a path of silly censorship just to inflict political dings.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
