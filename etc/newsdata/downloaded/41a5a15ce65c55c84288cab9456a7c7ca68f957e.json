I\u2019ve had a Magic Bullet before, but Vitamix really just makes the best blenders. They\u2019re just built way tougher than the cheaper ones. I usually start my day with a smoothie. I\u2019m not really a foodie. I just wanna get it in me and get on with my day. I have been known to do this when I don\u2019t have time: I\u2019ll make a big thing of food like meat and rice and vegetables in a pot \u2014 and this will sound fucking crazy \u2014 but if I don\u2019t have time to eat it, I\u2019ll put it in a blender, add some hot water to it, and turn it into a soup. That sounds gross but it\u2019s like a puree! You add a little salt and it\u2019s pretty fucking delicious. I put it in these glass Mason jars. People are always fascinated, like, \u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d I just want to say that that\u2019s rare. Usually I use it to make smoothies. Ben Greenfield has this gnarly smoothie recipe which I do my own take on.", "description": "Glenn Howerton, star of \u201cA.P.
