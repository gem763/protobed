Bush during the lead-up to the Iraq war, released a congressional campaign video here on Monday that was about as glossy as any Hollywood spy movie.\n\nIn the video, Plame, a Democrat who announced in May her bid for an open congressional seat in New Mexico, speeds across the desert in a sports car, kicking up clouds of dust as she drives in reverse and recounts her family\u2019s military background and her time as a CIA operative.\n\n\u201cYes, the CIA really does teach us how to drive like this,\u201d Plame says.\n\nThe video, which made a splash on social media, shows a photo of I. Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, the Bush administration official who was convicted of lying in an investigation into the unmasking of Plame, adding that U.S. President Donald Trump pardoned Libby last year.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m running for Congress because we\u2019re going backwards on national security, healthcare and women\u2019s rights,\u201d Plame says in a voiceover before pulling the car to a stop, stepping out of the vehicle and whipping off her sunglasses.\n\n\u201cAnd Mr. President, I\u2019ve got a few scores to settle,\u201d Plame adds.\n\nPlame is one of about a half dozen people running for New Mexico\u2019s 3rd Congressional District seat. The district\u2019s current lawmaker, Ben Ray Lujan, is making a U.S. Senate bid.\n\nWhile working undercover for the CIA, Plame recommended that the Bush administration send her then-husband, former diplomat Joseph Wilson, to Niger to probe allegations that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had sought to buy uranium to produce weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWilson later published an op-ed in The New York Times that cast doubt on the Bush administration\u2019s rationale for the war in Iraq.\n\nLibby, a senior aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, told journalists in private briefings that Plame was the person who had recommended Wilson for the trip, which led to her cover being blown.\n\nPlame said she moved to New Mexico the day after Libby was convicted of lying by a grand jury.", "description": "Allow her to reintroduce herself.", "authors": ["Makini Brice", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
