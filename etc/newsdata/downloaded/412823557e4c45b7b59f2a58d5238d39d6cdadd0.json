And Allegri has often spoken of how he looks up to Sir Alex.\n\nDuring his spell in Turin he said he would 'love' to be compared to Ferguson and hailed the Scotsman for his 27-year stay at Old Trafford.\n\nLegendary United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is a man Allegri looks up to\n\nALLEGRI'S TROPHY HAUL IN ITALY With Juventus - 2014-2019 - 5 Serie A titles. 4 Italian Cups, 2 Italian Super Cups With AC Milan - 2019-2014 - 1 Serie A title, 1 Italian Super Cup With Sassuolo - 2007-2008 - 1 Serie C! title\n\nAllegri's preference for a natural holding midfielder and his ability to adapt under pressure by deploying different formations, including 3-5-2, 4-4-1-1, 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1, also keeps goals conceded down to a minimum.\n\nAt the moment, the only member of his rearguard that Solskjaer can rely on is new \u00a380million signing Harry Maguire - with his fellow defenders not on the same level as the England international.\n\nThe 52-year-old Allegri's biggest strength is to create a compact backline when his side comes under intense pressure.\n\nAllegri, who has always enjoyed good relationships with his players, has become one of the most high-profile managers after enjoying success in Europe - progressing past the Champions League group stages in eight consecutive seasons and reaching the final on two occasions - losing to Barcelona in 2015 and Real Madrid two years later .\n\nTottenham are on the look out for a new manager to lead the post-Mauricio Pochettino era\n\nTottenham are enduring a very alarming slump in the Premier League under Pochettino\n\nHowever, it's not just United that have shown big interest in Allegri. Tottenham are also monitoring his situation as they line up a new manager for the post-Mauricio Pochettino era.\n\nBut Tottenham don't hold the same appeal to Allegri as United do - with the Italian manager looking to build on the massive legacy left by Ferguson during the Scot's remarkable 27-year spell at Old Trafford.\n\nHowever, one problem for either United or Tottenham would be that he doesn't want to inherit a team that has already started the season.\n\nAllegri wants to take full control of his new team in the summer so that he can conduct the transfer business and pre-season training regimes.\n\n", "description": "Manchester United have always been the club that have most fascinated Allegri, who stepped down as Juventus boss in the summer after making them become one of the most dominant forces in Europe.", "authors": ["Alvise Cagnazzo For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/09/19385314-0-image-a-51_1570436104508.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
