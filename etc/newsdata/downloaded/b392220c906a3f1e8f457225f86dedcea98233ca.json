In his column titled, \"Al-Baghdadi\u2019s death could have been Trump\u2019s finest hour. He messed it up anyway,\" Boot asserted that President Trump was wrong to have called Al-Baghdadi a coward because the terrorist blew himself and his children up instead of allowing himself to be captured by United States forces. Yes, Washington Post's star Never Trump columnist literally chose to praise Islamic extremists responsible for hundreds of deaths, rapes, and slavery in order to try and embarrass President Trump.\n\nHere's the key portion of Boot's column:\n\nA president who has never heard a shot fired in anger reveled in Baghdadi\u2019s last moments, even claiming \u201che died like a coward \u2026 whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.\u201d Trump could not possibly have heard \u201cwhimpering and crying\u201d on the overhead imagery because there was no audio, and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pointedly refused to confirm those details. The assertion that Baghdadi died as a coward was, in any case, contradicted by the fact that rather than be captured, he blew himself up.\n\nTrump could not have heard \u201cwhimpering and crying\u201d because there was no audio, and Esper and Milley refused to confirm those details.
