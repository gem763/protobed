An evening that began with the U.K. parliament\u2019s historic vote in favor of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal \u2014 the first time that British lawmakers have been able to agree a way out of the current impasse \u2014 ended with the rejection of the prime minister\u2019s plan to rush it into law in a matter of days.\n\nAs the looming Oct. 31 Brexit deadline agreed with the EU now looks impossible to meet, another extension is inevitable; as is the threat of squabbling inside the EU over its length.\n\nThe path of least resistance looks like the most likely outcome right now, with EU Council President Donald Tusk advocating a simple \u201cyes\u201d to the British extension request currently sitting on his desk. Johnson\u2019s various shenanigans in trying to disown this request sent over the weekend (he made clear he was being forced by members of Parliament to ask for something he didn\u2019t want) haven\u2019t convinced anyone. Kicking the can down the road to January 2020, as torturous as that seems, would avoid the need for a new EU summit on Brexit and would avert a costly no-deal exit.\n\nAside from Johnson, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron will probably be the most outspoken critic of this arrangement, and justifiably so. A three-month delay seems very long considering MPs aren\u2019t looking for a new deal; they\u2019re looking for time to scrutinize, debate and amend the existing one. France is impatient to get on with reforming the EU in its image, which the Brits\u2019 presence makes difficult. A short technical extension would focus MPs\u2019 minds on passing the deal, and would have the benefit of being the U.K. prime minister\u2019s preferred option.\n\nSo why drag Brexit out?\n\nThe answer lies in the EU\u2019s two unofficial guiding principles on Brexit: Never refuse an extension when it\u2019s in front of you, and don\u2019t get sucked into the quagmire of British politics.\n\nThe first principle is symbolized by the typically softer approach of Tusk and Germany\u2019s chancellor Angela Merkel. They fear a no-deal Brexit will backfire on the EU and don\u2019t want to push out a key trade and defense partner too hastily. The second makes sense in the context of wanting to stay well clear of the endless, and so far inconclusive, machinations in Westminster: Applying pressure on MPs to get on with approving a deal won\u2019t look so clever if Johnson\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement Bill starts to fall apart under scrutiny. As my colleague Therese Raphael wrote on Tuesday night, there\u2019s a lot to dislike in the devilishly complicated \u201csolution\u201d to the Irish border question.\n\nSo as tempting as it is from the EU\u2019s point of view to try to hurry Brexit along, the bloc might be better conforming to type and playing it safe. This extension could be made conditional on passing a deal soon, or \u2014 if MPs block it \u2014 on deeper change via a second referendum or a general election (which may be Johnson\u2019s preferred choice).\n\nStill, as the saga of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU lurches into 2020, almost four years on from the referendum, no one should discount the possibility of the bloc losing patience altogether. Having a member that\u2019s permanently stuck in the departure lounge isn\u2019t good for the smooth functioning of the EU, and Macron\u2019s administration has started to suggest that maybe no deal is better than infinite delays. There won\u2019t always be a letter requesting an extension sitting on Tusk\u2019s desk.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Lionel Laurent at llaurent2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nLionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Brussels.
