Democratic candidates for president in 2020 have largely avoided super PACs, but Biden\u2019s shift could lead more candidates to tacitly back outside groups. (Super PACs are not legally allowed to coordinate directly with campaigns, but an unkind word from a candidate is often all that\u2019s needed to deprive them of funding.)\n\nThe Biden campaign said President Donald Trump\u2019s false attacks on the former vice president made it necessary for it to welcome the help of a super PAC. Trump, the Republican National Committee and other GOP groups have spent more than $10 million attacking Biden, with much of that money aimed at the four early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cHe and his allies are already spending massive amount of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency,\u201d she added. \u201cNothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nBedingfield said Biden would support a public campaign finance system and a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision.\n\nBiden\u2019s decision drew nearly immediate condemnation from his progressive rivals in the 2020 campaign. Adam Green, a top ally of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, said Biden was putting his reputation as a longtime ally of the middle class at risk.\n\n\u201cBy making big-money corruption the center of how he funds his campaign, Biden severely jeopardizes his legacy as Common Man Joe that he spent decades cultivating,\u201d Green said. \u201cIf Biden cares about defeating Trump, he should not open the door to billionaires and corporations flooding the primary and should make clear he does not want his supporters to use big money to attack other Democrats.\u201d\n\nHow will a middle-class guy accept you if you accept money? Joe Biden, 2018\n\nThe campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who attacked Hillary Clinton over her support from super PACs during the 2016 presidential election, aimed a similar volley at Biden.\n\n\u201cThe former Vice President has been unable to generate grassroots support, and now his campaign is endorsing an effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations,\u201d Sanders campaign manger Faiz Shakir said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we defeat Trump. It\u2019s a recipe to maintain a corrupt political system which enriches wealthy donors and leaves the working class behind.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s decision comes as he falls behind the other candidates in the money race, even though he still leads in much of the public polling. His campaign has just $9 million on hand, the fifth-highest total in the 2020 Democratic primary field. Sanders has $33.7 million in the bank, and Warren has $25.7 million. Even South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who are both well behind Biden in public polling, have more campaign funds than he does. Biden has struggled to raise money online from small-dollar donors at the same pace as his competitors, and many of his donors have already given the federal maximum of $2,800.\n\nEnd Citizens United, a Democratic campaign finance reform group, criticized Biden for his reversal and said his fundraising struggles were no excuse. In a statement, it noted less than a month had passed since Biden last said he wouldn\u2019t welcome a super PAC. At that time, Trump\u2019s attacks on the former vice president had already begun.\n\n\u201cThe path forward for his campaign depends on Democratic primary voters trusting that they\u2019d have more say in a Biden administration than big money donors. It is incredibly disappointing to see Vice President Biden completely reverse his position now that times are tough,\u201d said Tiffany Muller, End Citizens United\u2019s president. \u201cThis is exactly the time he needs support from real people the most. We urge him to reconsider this decision and disavow this super PAC.\u201d\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s campaign will dismiss much of the criticism aimed at his decision as coming from partisans who dislike his candidacy for ideological reasons or are backing his opponents, he can\u2019t say the same of End Citizens United. The group, which has pressured all of the campaigns to reject single-candidate super PACs, is neutral in the 2020 presidential primary and helped many moderate Democratic candidates win House seats during the 2018 midterms.\n\nIf a super PAC forms to back Biden \u2015 and it would be shocking if one did not \u2015 he would become the second candidate in the field to welcome an outside group accepting massive donations. Businessman Andrew Yang welcomed the support of a super PAC earlier this week. A super PAC has formed to support New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, but he has said he doesn\u2019t want the group\u2019s help. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee embraced the support of a super PAC before he dropped out of the race in August.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if Biden will appear at fundraisers for a super PAC. If a group begins raising and spending money during 2019, it will have to reveal its donors in January, before the first Democratic primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nBiden has a long history as a campaign finance advocate, and has been fiercely critical of super PACs in the past. During an appearance on \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d in 2018, Biden said he told Sanders not to create a super PAC during his 2016 run.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the guy that told him, you shouldn\u2019t accept any money from a super PAC, because people can\u2019t possibly trust you,\u201d Biden said at the time. \u201cHow will a middle-class guy accept you if you accept money?\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "description": "Biden once said support from super PACs meant the middle class couldn\u2019t trust a politician.
