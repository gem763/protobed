Discussions on Monday were tense and required some breaks, said some people familiar with the negotiations.\n\nCooler heads prevailed and bargaining continued into the night, sources said. Most observers didn't expect a quick resolution.\n\n\u201cNegotiations have resumed,\" GM spokesman David Barnas said in a statement Monday afternoon. \"Our goal remains to reach an agreement that builds a stronger future for our employees and our business.\u201d\n\nThe strike appeared to drive GM's stock price down in trading all day, finishing off 4.25% at $37.21.\n\nWages and health care have emerged as contentious problems among several unresolved issues. Those briefed on discussions differ over what's on the table.\n\nOne person said GM has proposed that workers pay 15% of their health care costs, up from the current estimated level of 3% of health expenses. Another person familiar with talks said GM's offer preserves current health care benefits at the same cost.\n\nGM and Ford, which will negotiate with the union after a deal is struck with GM, each spend $1 billion a year on worker health care, which some industry observers consider unsustainable. The average U.S. worker pays about 28% of health care costs, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor.\n\n\u201cWe have many unresolved issues,\u201d Terry Dittes, vice president of the UAW GM department, said early Monday in an interview with Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a couple of things. How long will this take? I can\u2019t say.\u201d\n\nCost to both sides\n\nThose close to the UAW believe it will be a long strike, perhaps lasting two to four weeks.\n\n\"People don\u2019t realize how angry the workers are and that the health care proposal made them nuts,\" said a person familiar with both sides who insisted on not being identified to preserve those relationships.\n\nOthers said the many unresolved issues could come together quickly if a few key issues get resolved.\n\nGM took the unusual step Sunday of making public a version of what it said was its offer, which included $7 billion in investment and more than 5,000 new jobs over the four-year life of the contract, and an assertion that the company offered an improved profit-sharing formula and preservation of top-line health benefits.\n\nDittes said GM's offer came to the union only two hours before Saturday night's deadline, and had it come sooner, the strike might have been averted.\n\nHarley Shaiken, a professor at University of California, Berkeley who is a labor export, saw some reason for optimism.\n\n\u201cThere are two things that make me think that this strike could be shorter rather than longer,\" he said. \"First, they\u2019re back at the table at 10 a.m. Monday.\"\n\nShaiken said often during a strike both sides stay away from the table for a few days or call in a mediator.\n\n\"Second, the letter that Terry Dittes sent saying this is the first serious proposal, otherwise we might have had a settlement,\" Shaiken said. \"That\u2019s saying what you\u2019re proposing here, we could perhaps use as the basis of a settlement.\u201d\n\nThe cost of a strike is hard on both GM and the UAW workers, who earn a strike wage of $250 a week.\n\nMoody\u2019s lead GM and auto analyst Bruce Clark said: \"GM's ability to contend with a short-duration strike (no more than one to two weeks) is comfortably supported by its 77 days of U.S. inventory, $17.5 billion of automotive cash, and $16.5 billion available under its credit facility. Beyond the initial one to two weeks, the financial burden of a strike will become more material and the prospects of a contract that avoids erosion of the company's current competitive position is less likely.\"\n\nLikewise, Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy said the impact of lost production alone will cost GM about $50 million each day the strike continues.\n\nFor the duration of the strike, the Teamsters union said it is honoring the UAW\u2019s picket lines. So the approximately 1,000 Teamsters who transport GM vehicles will not be hauling them to dealerships. The Teamsters said that represents a significant portion of GM deliveries.", "description": "GM and the UAW continued bargaining Monday after a nationwide strike started Sunday.
