I imagine that means that YouTube in particular is going to be crawling with ads for it, so that we\u2019ll look back on these days of saying, \u2018Why isn\u2019t there any marketing for it?\u2019 with a kind of fondness. Jokes aside though, as someone that was initially very keen to hear about it I find myself strangely unexcited for the whole thing.\n\nMy interest was piqued when I thought, as many seemed to, that it was going to be the Netflix of gaming. While in fact the main idea is that you buy games for regular prices and stream them instead of owning them. There is some kind of streaming service coming next year, which is maybe closer to what I imagined, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s going to be out next month.\n\nI\u2019m still in two minds about whether to give it a go and funnily enough one thing that puts me off is the way Google has quietly discontinued their Daydream VR headset. Never heard of it? Well, it\u2019s because Google put no effort into selling it and gave up after a couple of years, which they have a long history of doing with new ventures and which is almost certainly going to be the fate of Stadia if it\u2019s not an instant hit.\n\nPersonally I think they\u2019re going to be pretty easily outmanoeuvred by Microsoft and Sony. Their only hope is some important exclusive games, but I\u2019m still not seeing any sign of that.\n\nTommy", "description": "The Wednesday Inbox works out how to get an even cheaper Switch Lite at Tesco, as one reader wishes GTA V had a VR mode.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/stadium-color-logo-3b78_1571185471.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
