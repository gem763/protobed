She studied economics at the universities of G\u00f6ttingen and M\u00fcnster before attending the London School of Economics where she used the pseudonym Rose Ladson because she was seen as a potential target for West German leftwing extremists.\n\nVon der Leyen then read for a medical degree, becoming a gynaecologist, and only entered politics at 42. A mother of seven, she has held government positions as labour and family affairs minister, driving forward key policies on gender quotas for company boards and improved maternity and paternity pay and rights \u2013 policies that initially won her considerable popularity.\n\nIn 2011, Von der Leyen spoke of her desire for a \u201cUnited States of Europe along the lines of federal states like Switzerland, Germany or the US\u201d. She has since claimed that Brexit, and the loss of the \u201cpragmatism\u201d of the British in the EU, should propel the bloc towards further integration, and has voiced support for a European army.\n\nShe is a key ally of Angela Merkel, with whom she has worked since 2005. Like Merkel, she has championed the idea of a close relationship between the EU and UK after Brexit.\n\n\n\nVon der Leyen, though, has been withering about those who campaigned for Brexit, Describing events since the referendum as a \u201cburst bubble of hollow promises \u2026 inflated by populists\u201d. She has cautioned that a no-deal Brexit would be the \u201cworst possible start\u201d to the close long-term EU-UK relationship that Berlin holds desirable.\n\nThe nicknames she has acquired over the course of her 29-year career in German politics tell their own story. During her time in charge of the family ministry, she was first called Krippen-Ursel (\u201ccr\u00e8che Ursel\u201d), a conservative closet feminist set on expanding nursery places, and then Zensursula, a control freak who wanted to shield German youth from the dark sides of the internet.\n\nWhen she became Germany\u2019s first female defence minister in 2013, her (mostly male) detractors referred to her as Flinten-Uschi (\u201cshotgun Uschi\u201d), a caricature of the bossy career woman.\n\nAs commission president, Von der Leyen will represent the EU on the world stage, and a key task will be building a working relationship with Donald Trump\u2019s White House. She has previously criticised a lack of strategy in Trump\u2019s approach to Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and has suggested the US president\u2019s frosty relationship with Merkel is based on his outdated view of women.\n\nDaniel Boffey in Brussels and Philip Oltermann in Berlin", "description": "Ursula von der Leyen, incoming European commission chief, pilloried over fuzzy titles for EU\u2019s most senior officials", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe4fb058c65ed40bc88523842345d4b938a4d20/0_281_5706_3424/master/5706.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f07ec16c1d044f5ec2324847ef1a6447", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
