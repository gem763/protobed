The Cardinals will have ace Jack Flaherty on the mound, and the Braves will go with Mike Foltynewicz.\n\nKolten Wong led off the St. Louis 10th with a ground-rule double against Julio Teheran. After Paul Goldschmidt was intentionally walked, Wong advanced on Marcell Ozuna's forceout and easily scampered home on Molina's fly to the front of the warning track in left field.\n\nWong threw his hands in the air as he ran toward the plate. Molina rounded first base with his bat in hand, then flung it away as the celebration erupted. The 37-year-old catcher discarded his batting helmet as the rest of the Cardinals poured onto the field.\n\nMolina made it 4-all with a two-out single in the eighth that went just off the top of the glove of a leaping Freddie Freeman at first.\n\n\"I thought it was going in there,\" the 6-foot-5 Freeman said. \"I just needed to be 6-7.\"\n\nOzzie Albies homered and drove in three runs for Atlanta, and Ronald Acuna Jr. had four hits. But the NL East champions went 0 for 9 with runners in scoring position, a continuing problem in the post-season over the past two years.\n\nMissed opportunities for Braves\n\nThe Braves left the bases loaded in the sixth and seventh. Acuna was stranded on third when Josh Donaldson flied out in the ninth.\n\n\"We're a hit away from \u2014 just some productive outs \u2014 from continuing to add on,\" manager Brian Snitker said.\n\nOzuna homered twice for St. Louis, and Goldschmidt also connected. But the NL Central champions were four outs from a second straight difficult loss before Molina delivered down the stretch.\n\nAlbies gave Atlanta a 4-3 lead with a two-run homer off Dakota Hudson in the fifth, capping a three-run rally.\n\nThe Braves carried the advantage all the way into the eighth, but Goldschmidt doubled and Molina came up with the tying hit off Shane Greene.\n\nCarlos Martinez gave St. Louis a lift after Acuna led off the ninth with a double, retiring three in a row. The closer took the loss Sunday when he gave up three runs in the ninth in Atlanta's 3-1 victory.\n\nGame 1 starter Miles Mikolas worked the 10th for the win.", "description": "Yadier Molina pushed the St. Louis Cardinals to a deciding Game 5 of the NL Division Series, hitting a tying single in the eighth inning and a winning sacrifice fly in the 10th to beat the Atlanta Braves 5-4 Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5312748.1570491642!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/nlds-braves-cardinals-baseball.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
