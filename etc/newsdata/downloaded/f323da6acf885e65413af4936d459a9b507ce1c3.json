In The Name Of Love, to her solo disco reinvention on such 1980s hits as Upside Down and I'm Coming Out.\n\n\"To all my fans across the world, this is my tribute to you,\" the singer said. \"Every concert feels like a private party. I can see your eyes and feel your hearts. I'm coming to Glastonbury, with love.\"\n\nNext year's Glastonbury takes place from 24 to 28 June. The event sold out in just 34 minutes last weekend, although there will be a chance to purchase returned tickets in April 2020.\n\nNext year will be festival's golden anniversary, marking 50 years since Michael Eavis first invited 1,500 hippies to his farm Pilton, Somerset, to watch acts like Al Green, Wayne Fontana and headliners T Rex.\n\nIn those days, tickets cost \u00a31 and came with a free bottle of milk. In 2020, a ticket will set you back \u00a3265, with 175,000 people expected to attend.\n\nHeadliners have yet to be announced, but acts rumoured for the top of the bill include Sir Paul McCartney, Fleetwood Mac and Taylor Swift.\n\nOne band who won't be taking part, however, is Abba. Asked if the quartet would ever consider reforming to play the legend slot, Bjorn Ulvaeus told BBC Radio 2: \"Oh, no. It's a straight, straight no.\n\n\"We recorded some new songs and you'll probably hear them next year, at least one of them,\" he told Nicky Chapman, who was sitting in for breakfast host Zoe Ball.\n\n\"But that's quite a different thing from going through the hassle of rehearsing and - just one show, it would be the same as doing a whole year of tours,\" he added. \"It would take 10 years out of our life.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
