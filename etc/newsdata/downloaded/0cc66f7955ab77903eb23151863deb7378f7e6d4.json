These are Coinbase, Poloniex, Bitstamp, bitFlyer, Liquid and itBit.\n\nThose rated A (such as Binance, Kraken, OKEx, etc.) represented 14.3% or USD 71.98 billion, while the B-rated exchanges (such as Bitfinex, Korbit, BitBank, etc.) represented 4.7% or USD 23.86 billion USD) of total aggregate volume last month.\n\nAdditionally, on aggregate, the report says that volume from top-tier exchanges, those rated AA-B decreased 15.0%, only representing 21.9% of the total market or USD 111 billion, while volume from lower-tier exchanges, which are rated C-F, decreased 29.7%. However, trading volume on E-rated exchanges jumped by almost 32%.\n\nSource: CryptoCompare\n\nCryptoCompare\u2019s CEO, Charles Hayter, told Cryptonews.com that \u201cwhat is implicit in the \"E-rating\" for these exchanges is a natural lack of transparency in terms of who runs the exchange, which licenses are in place if any, and how client funds are protected.\u201d While the provider is working on improving their methodologies so to give traders the means by which they can choose the exchanges of the highest quality, they explain that it\u2019s \u201cdifficult to say whether these volumes are indeed \"fake,\" however they are certainly less trustworthy than their top-tier competitors.\u201d\n\nAccording to the CEO, one explanation for this increase in trading volumes of the poorly rated exchanges is that \u201cthis relates to the fact that lower-tier exchanges typically only offer crypto to crypto markets with various incentive schemes in place, which could counter the volume trends seen in most top-tier exchanges.\u201d\n\nCryptoCompare\u2019s ranking methodology utilizes a combination of qualitative (due diligence) and quantitative (market quality based on order book and trades) metrics, without using volume directly in the ranking. Of the 110 exchanges that the site lists, twenty-three are rated AA, A and B, twenty-three more rated D, while forty-nine got E or F grades.\n\nIn either case, this is not the first time we\u2019ve reported a good performance by the lower-graded exchanges, as just in August CryptoCompare claimed that, even though top-ranked exchanges have increased their market share in July, 'untrusted' exchanges increased their dominance even more in 2019.\n\nAdditional information CryptoCompare shared in the report include that:", "description": "Some exchanges with poor ratings have seen an increase in September's trading volumes, while the best rated market players have registered a decrease, says the latest report by CryptoCompare, a provider of the crypto market data.", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5da/dc4a66f0bf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
