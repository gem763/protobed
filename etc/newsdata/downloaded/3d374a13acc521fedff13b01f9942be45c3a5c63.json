He wore a white outfit, was handcuffed, with shackles on his legs and a bandage on his neck as police special forces helped him out of the aircraft and took him to the court building.\n\nThe man, identified as Stephan B., modeled Wednesday\u2019s attack on a shooting spree at New Zealand mosques earlier this year in which 51 people were killed. He wanted to kill as many people as possible in the synagogue in the eastern city of Halle, the prosecutor said.\n\nDozens of people were at the synagogue on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year, when the gunman tried to blast his way in - only to fail to breach the solid locked gates.\n\n\u201cWhat we experienced yesterday was terrorism. According to our findings, the suspect Stephan B. aimed to carry out a massacre,\u201d federal prosecutor Peter Frank told reporters.\n\n\u201cStephan B., a man who was influenced by scary anti-Semitism, xenophobia and racism, was heavily armed,\u201d Frank added. \u201cHe armed himself with many weapons, some possibly self-made, and had a large quantity of explosives.\u201d\n\nInvestigators found 4 kilograms of explosives in his car.\n\nIn a video lasting more than 30 minutes that the attacker live-streamed from a helmet camera, he was heard cursing his failure to gain entry to the synagogue before shooting dead a woman passer-by in the street and a man in a nearby kebab restaurant.\n\nTwo other people were injured but not critically.\n\nHolger Stahlknecht, interior minister of Saxony Anhalt, the state where Halle is located, said the suspect was not known to intelligence authorities. He said police took seven minutes to reach the synagogue after receiving the first report a woman had been shot outside the building.\n\nWhen they arrived, the gunman had moved on to a nearby kebab shop, where he killed a man. An exchange of fire ensued, during which the perpetrator suffered a neck wound before fleeing. Police captured him 1-1/2 hours after the attack began.\n\n\u201cStephan B. wanted to be copycat in two senses,\u201d said prosecutor Frank. \u201cHe wanted to mimic similar acts that happened in the past, and he also wanted to incite others to copycat his acts.\u201d\n\nJustice Minister Christine Lambrecht said right-wing extremism \u201cis one of the biggest threats facing us\u201d. She vowed to get tougher on online platforms if they carry threats or material that incites hatred.\n\n\u201cWe unfortunately have to face the truth, which - for some time already - is that the threat of anti-Semitism, right-wing extremism, and right-wing terrorism is very high,\u201d Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said.\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier speaks to the media next to his wife Elke Budenbender and Saxony-Anhalt State Premier Reiner Haseloff outside the synagogue in Halle, Germany October 10, 2019, after two people were killed in a shooting. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch\n\nMERKEL SHOCKED\n\nEarlier, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany must crack down on hate, violence and hostility.\n\n\u201cI am, like millions of people in Germany, shocked and dejected by the crime that was perpetrated in Halle yesterday,\u201d Merkel said to loud applause in an address to a trade union congress in Nuremberg.\n\nA military source said Stephan B. had done military service, but received no special training. His full name cannot be published under German privacy laws.\n\nThe suspect would appear before federal judges on Thursday, accused of two counts of murder, Frank said. Questions remained about how he armed himself and whether he had any accomplices.\n\nMost Jewish institutions in large German cities have a near-permanent police guard due to the threat of anti-Semitic attacks by both far-right activists and Islamist militants.\n\nJosef Schuster, president of the council of Germany\u2019s 200,000-strong Jewish community, criticized police for not being present at the synagogue in Halle.\n\n\u201cIf police had been stationed outside the synagogue, then this man could have been disarmed before he could attack the others,\u201d Schuster told Deutschlandfunk public radio.\n\nSlideshow (32 Images)\n\nHowever, the head of Germany\u2019s police union was skeptical about providing that level of protection.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d have to guard every synagogue, every church, every mosque, every holy place in Germany around the clock, so I don\u2019t know if this was a mistake or if this really couldn\u2019t have been foreseen,\u201d Oliver Malchow told ARD public television.", "description": "A gunman suspected of attacking a German synagogue and killing two people nearby wanted to commit a massacre and hoped to incite others to copy him by live-streaming his deadly rampage, Germany's federal prosecutor said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Hannibal Hanschke", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439247824&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF99138", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
