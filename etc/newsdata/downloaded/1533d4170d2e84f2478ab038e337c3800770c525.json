Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for president on MSNBC Friday evening and confidently said that Sanders \u201cabsolutely can win this.\u201d\n\nThe Capitalism: A Love Story director officially threw his weight behind Sanders during an appearance on MSNBC. While Moore said he loves Warren and has for years, he believes Sanders is the right man for the job, citing the lawmaker\u2019s understanding of the \u201cgreedy form of capitalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy me for Bernie?\u201d Moore began. \u201cBecause Bernie understands that capitalism and the greedy form of capitalism \u2013 especially what we have now \u2013 is at the core of so many of the problems that we\u2019re talking about. And he\u2019s not afraid to come out and just say that\u2013 that that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think he\u2019s in a position to win the nomination and be president?\u201d host Ari Melber asked.\n\n\u201cOh absolutely,\u201d Moore said, citing an Emerson Poll released this week.\n\n\u201cI mean there was the Emerson Poll in Iowa yesterday, showed a head to head with Bernie, Biden, and Elizabeth,\u201d the Sicko producer said. \u201cOnly one of them came out ahead of Trump, and that was Bernie Sanders. He\u2019s absolutely \u2014 absolutely can win this.\u201d\n\nThe poll Moore referenced showed both Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) leading the Democrat field in the Hawkeye State with 23 percent each, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with 16 percent, and Sanders dropping to fourth with 13 percent support. However, Moore is correct, as the hypothetical general election matchups show Trump besting Biden and Warren by two points \u2013 51 percent to 49 percent \u2013 and Sanders leading Trump by the same, with 51 percent to Trump\u2019s 49 percent. However, with a margin of error of +/-3.2, the candidates are in a virtual dead heat in Iowa.\n\nMoore is expected to formally endorse Sanders alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) at the \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally in New York City Saturday afternoon.", "description": "Left-wing producer Michael Moore endorsed Bernie Sanders for president and confidently said that Sanders \"absolutely can win this.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/01/MichaelMooreResistance100Days.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
