We\u2019ll break down everything you need to know, no matter what type of couch you have.\n\nFirst, look for the cleaning care label. It will have one of the following letters:\n\nW: Clean with water\n\nS: Clean with a specialised solvent\n\nWS: Use either water or a solvent\n\nX: Do not use liquid, use only a dry method\n\nFor the water-based method, combine 2 cups distilled water with 1 tablespoon each dish soap and white vinegar. Dip a microfiber cloth in the solution and blot the stain. Then dip a clean cloth in fresh distilled water and bot again. Finally, blot with a dry cloth.\n\nFor using a solvent, buy the product designated on the label and follow your manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nFor the dry method, use a hard bristled brush to loosen dirt, then sprinkle the couch with baking soda. Let sit 15-20 minutes and vacuum up.\n\nIf you have an ink stain, just blot with rubbing alcohol.
