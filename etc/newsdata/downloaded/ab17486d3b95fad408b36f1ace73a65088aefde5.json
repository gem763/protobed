It issued the rules with the hope of detaining immigrant children in facilities with their parents.\n\nThe 1997 agreement allows for the settlement to be phased out when rules are issued for the care of detained immigrant children that honor its terms.\n\nThe attorneys who represent detained immigrant children celebrated Gee\u2019s position on the case, which she conveyed to them in a draft ruling. They said they wouldn\u2019t let the administration use young immigrants to try to deter migrants fleeing desperate conditions from seeking asylum.\n\n\u201cWe will continue vigorously to defend the rights of detained immigrant children,\u201d Neha Desai, director of immigration at the National Center for Youth Law, told reporters.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Justice said the administration is disappointed with the ruling because they did what was required to implement the new rules.\n\nDuring the hearing, August Flentje, an attorney for the government, argued the rules were consistent with the agreement and the government had spent significant time to develop them.\n\nAttorneys for both sides said they would be willing to meet and discuss whether some aspects of the rules aren\u2019t subject to the settlement. Gee gave them until Oct. 4 to do so.\n\nMore than 400,000 immigrants traveling in family groups with children have been stopped on the Mexico border in the past year.\n\nIn its crackdown, the Trump administration has had migrants await immigration court hearings in Mexico and required those who cross through a third country to seek refuge there before applying for asylum in the U.S.\n\nImmigrant advocates have decried the changes, which threaten asylum for many people fleeing violence in their countries.\n\nThe Los Angeles case dates back to the 1980s, when immigrant advocates sued the government over detention conditions for immigrant youth. The settlement reached in 1997 requires children to be released from custody as soon as possible to a relative in the United States.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Judge Dolly Gee is calling the administration's rules inconsistent with a longstanding agreement that lays out conditions for child custody.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/migrant-children.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
