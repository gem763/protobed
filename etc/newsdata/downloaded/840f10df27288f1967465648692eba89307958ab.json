Gazeta do Povo noted that Bolsonaro is a fan of another team, Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, but described Flamengo as the \u201cbest Brazilian team today.\u201d\n\nChina is Brazil\u2019s largest trading partner thanks to being under socialist rule for most of the current millennium. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who pioneered the relationship between Brasilia and Beijing, is currently serving a decades-long prison sentence for laundering money and accepting kickbacks.\n\nBolsonaro and Xi signed eight agreements, according to Brazil\u2019s O Globo newspaper, after an extensive communist military pageant in Tiananmen Square, home to one of the bloodiest massacres in the history of dictatorships worldwide.\n\nBolsonaro eased restrictions for Chinese nationals visiting Brazil and signed a deal allowing more Chinese students into the country, who have attempted to violently impose the Communist Party\u2019s ideology in universities in Australia and other free states. As a presidential candidate, Bolsonaro campaigned on eradicating Marxist ideology from schools.\n\nBolsonaro also signed trade agreements involving processed beef, cottonseed meal for livestock feed, renewable energy projects, and access to Brazil\u2019s vast natural resources.\n\n\u201cBrazil is a sea of opportunity for China,\u201d Bolsonaro said. \u201cBrazil needs China, and China needs Brazil.\u201d\n\nThe Brazilian government has invited Chinese state-owned companies to participate in an auction for rights to offshore oil access in November, despite China\u2019s atrocious environmental record and its history of using state-owned companies to strongarm foreign entities into silence over its human rights abuses.\n\nPrior to Bolsonaro\u2019s meeting with Xi Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed pleasure with his presence at formal events upon arriving Thursday.\n\n\u201cSince President Bolsonaro was sworn in, he has been committed to bilateral relations with China. He noted that the new Brazilian government values China as a major country, and expressed the country\u2019s readiness to become China\u2019s sincere friend,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. \u201cBrazil will carry out cooperation with China in various fields instead of just in the economic and trade sector. He hopes high-level exchange will bring more win-win outcomes to both and open up new prospects in bilateral relations. It is fair to say that our relationship enjoys great potentials and a bright prospect.\u201d\n\nXi also expressed satisfaction at his close relationship with Xi.\n\n\u201cThe world is undergoing unprecedented changes, but the historic trend of peace, development and win-win collaboration is unchanged,\u201d Chinese state media paraphrased Xi as saying. \u201cThe momentum brought by the rise of developing countries and emerging markets including China and Brazil has not changed.\u201d", "description": "Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 who campaigned as a hardline anti-communist \u2013 signed eight trade agreements with Xi Jinping on Friday.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177992076-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
