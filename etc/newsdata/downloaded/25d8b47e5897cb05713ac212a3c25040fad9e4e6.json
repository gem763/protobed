But even that target now appears optimistic. The country has posted less than 2 percent growth four times since 1954 -- in 1956 (0.7 percent) due to a lean harvest; in 1980 (-1.7) due to the second Middle East oil crisis; in 1998 (-5.5 percent) due to the Asian financial crisis; and in 2009 (0.8 percent) due to the global financial crisis.\n\nMore troubling is that the psychologically important 2-percent level may be breached this year, without any major economic shock.\n\nSung Tae-yoon at Yonsei University said, \"Since the economy grew 3.2 percent in 2017, if the rate falls to below 2 percent in just over two years, it is tantamount to a 40 percent decline in earnings terms.\"\n\nSung added, \"Government spending is necessary to stimulate private-sector consumption and investments, but fiscal spending right now is mostly geared toward welfare and is not playing a huge role in bolstering potential growth.\"", "description": "Korea's Economic Growth Could Fall Below Key 2% Level This Year", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
