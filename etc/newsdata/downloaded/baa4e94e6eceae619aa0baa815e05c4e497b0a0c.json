(Photo: King Arthur Flour co.)\n\nKing Arthur Flour has expanded the recall of some bags of its flour over concerns for possible E. coli contamination.\n\nIn a safety alert on the Food & Drug Administration website, the company said it expanding a voluntary recall of 5-pound and 25-pound bags of King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour because of the potential presence of E. coli found in samples of the product.\n\nThe recall is an expansion of one announced June 13, 2019, which involved nearly 114,000 5-pound bags of flour. The flour, milled at ADM Milling in Buffalo, New York, and produced prior to February 2019, was distributed nationwide and sold in stores as well as on King Arthur's website, its catalog, and store in Norwich, Vermont.\n\n\"Our consistent responsibility to transparency and our customers hasn\u2019t changed, and so we\u2019ve expanded our June voluntary recall to include any additional lots that might have any association with those two lots,\" said Gwen Adams, spokesperson for King Arthur Flour.\n\nNational Taco Day 2019: Where to get free tacos, $1 tacos and deals Friday\n\nJobs report: Employers added just 136,000 jobs in September while unemployment hits a new 50-year low\n\nADM Milling was also involved with another recall involving 5-pound bags of Baker's Corner All Purpose Flour sold at select Aldi stores in 11 states over concerns of E. coli contamination. In June, a separate voluntary recall of ADM Milling-made Pillsbury Best Bread Flour (5-pound bags) was also announced.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in May said health officials were investigating ADM Milling about a multistate outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O26 infections linked to flour packaged by the company. At the time, the E. coli outbreak had sickened 17 people in eight states.\n\nThe CDC said in July that the outbreak had ended but warned that consumers might still have potentially contaminated flour in their freezers or refrigerators.\n\nSo far, there have been no illnesses caused by the product reported, the company says.\n\nThe 5-pound bags have Best Used By Dates ranging from 12/04/19 to 1/15/20.
