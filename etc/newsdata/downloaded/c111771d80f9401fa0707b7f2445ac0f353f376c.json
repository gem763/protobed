He combined to allow just three earned runs (five hits) with 20 strikeouts through 13 innings against the White Sox and Nationals. Tonight\u2019s matchup at Philadelphia sounds more intimidating than it actually is, as the Phillies rank 19th in wRC+ this season with an above-average strikeout rate (23%) to boot. Fried checks in as a -165 road favorite, and I feel comfortable backing him through all DFS formats.\n\nAlso Consider: Walker Buehler, Jose Quintana\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nEric Thames - Milwaukee (at Miami)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe park factor isn\u2019t great, but I\u2019m still looking towards Thames in DFS this evening. His salary is relaxed, and the matchup is outstanding while facing Miami RHP Elieser Hernandez\u2019s .392 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Thames has recorded six hits with two homers over his last five starts, and I\u2019m expecting him to come through tonight.\n\nAlso Consider: Carlos Santana, Brandon Belt, David Freese\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nKolten Wong - St. Louis (at Colorado)\n\nThe Cardinals check in with the highest run-scoring projection of the night, as they\u2019ll travel to the hitting utopia of Coors Field. The matchup is certainly favorable as well, given that RHP Chi Chi Gonzalez (7.29 ERA) will take the bump for Colorado. Gonzalez holds an inflated .417 wOBA split to left-handed bats, meaning Kolten Wong is ripe for the picking in DFS.\n\nAlso Consider: Ozzie Albies, Cory Spangenberg\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nMatt Carpenter - St. Louis (at Colorado)\n\nAs mentioned in the previous write-up, Colorado RHP Gonzalez has been terrible against left-handed bats. Carpenter had a brutal cold-streak through most of August, but he\u2019s seemingly finding his groove while going 5-7 with two doubles, two runs, and two RBIs over his last three games. Needless to say, this is an excellent spot for a breakout performance.\n\nAlso consider: Justin Turner, Yoan Moncada\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nPaul DeJong - St. Louis (at Colorado)\n\nDeJong isn\u2019t left-handed, so he won\u2019t have an opportunity to cash in on that aforementioned vulnerability of Colorado RHP Gonzalez. However, the Cardinals\u2019 shortstop has been sizzling with five hits, two homers, four runs, and five RBIs over his past five games. The move to hitter-friendly Coors Field enhances that upside.\n\nAlso Consider: Trevor Story, Dansby Swanson\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nFranmil Reyes - Cleveland (at LA Angels)\n\nReyes carries a mid-range salary on most DFS sites, and I\u2019m really excited about his floor/ceiling combination tonight. The matchup creates room for optimism, as LAA LHP Jose Suarez has struggled at the major league level by holding a 6.45 ERA with 84 hits allowed through 68.1 innings. Reyes has been warming up over the past week, and he should enjoy the platoon advantage in this confident draw.\n\nChris Taylor - LA Dodgers (at Baltimore)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Cardinals represent the highest run-scoring projection of the night. The Dodgers are right behind them while facing a terrible Orioles\u2019 pitching staff in Baltimore. In other words, you\u2019ll want some exposure to the mighty LAD lineup. A.J. Pollock and Justin Turner are prime lifts against Baltimore LHP Ty Blach, but Taylor represents an affordable option with capable upside. The Dodgers\u2019 utility man has collected seven hits with two homers and five runs over his past five starts.\n\nAlso consider: Christian Yelich, Aristides Aquino, A.J. Pollock, Dexter Fowler, Tommy Edman, Yasiel Puig, Josh Reddick, Trent Grisham", "description": "Spencer Limbach runs through the best MLB DFS Plays for the 14-game slate on Tuesday, September 10.
