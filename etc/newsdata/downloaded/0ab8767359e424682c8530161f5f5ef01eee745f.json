Forrest Gump is, in fact, named after Nathan Bedford Forrest. \u201cAnd he was a great man,\u201d Gump says in the novel, \u201ccept\u2019n he started up the Ku Klux Klan after the war was over an even my grandmama say they\u2019s a bunch a no-goods.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat you racist trigger happy people don\u2019t realize because I guess you can\u2019t read, is that [Nathan Bedford Forrest] also DISBANDED the KKK when he realized it was being used as a lynch mob,\u201d Williams wrote on Facebook in an exceedingly generous interpretation of what the Klan was and did.\n\nWilliams notes, too, that Nathan Bedford Forrest Day is still celebrated in Tennessee (this is true) and that there\u2019s a bust of the man in the state\u2019s capitol (also true). He\u2019s buried in a public park in Memphis that used to bear his name.\n\nBut just because Forrest is, for whatever reason, still celebrated in Tennessee doesn\u2019t make him anything less than a racist. He was a slave trader, and early leader of the Klan, though he did, as Williams notes, disavow the organization and call for it to be disbanded later in his life. He\u2019s been blamed for massacring black Union troops at Fort Pillow while serving as a general in the Civil War.\n\nHis image in Tennessee has been perennially controversial. A (very ugly) statue of Forrest was doused in pink paint in 2017, and the guy who owned it said he wouldn\u2019t take the paint off. A statue of him in Memphis, erected in 1905, was taken down in 2017 \u2014 and the state legislature punished the city by cutting funding for a bicentennial celebration after they took it down.\n\n\u201cRide with Forrest isn't racist,\u201d Williams wrote on Facebook. \u201cIt is recognizing that he was the master of the saddle during the civil war.\u201d", "description": "Nichole Williams posted a photo of herself on Facebook with a patch that reads \"Ride with Forrest,\" a reference to an early leader of the KKK.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9f441162c27f0009452303/lede/1570719174521-nathan-bedford-forrest.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7928xh;0xw,0.0382xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
