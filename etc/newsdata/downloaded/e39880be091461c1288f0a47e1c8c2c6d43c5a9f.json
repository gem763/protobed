During the summer months, it had previously moved at a rate only occasionally exceeding 30cm a day.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

experiencing a period of great changes due to climate factors, so it is especially vulnerable\u201d, Mr Miserocchi said.\n\nHe said there was no immediate risk to residential areas.\n\nThe warning prompted Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte to mention the increased risks the climate crisis poses during an address at the UN general assembly on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cNews that a glacier on Mont Blanc risks collapsing is a warning that can\u2019t leave us indifferent, it must shake us up and we have to mobilise,\u201d he said.\n\nBut experts have said there is no way of knowing exactly when the glacier will collapse, and there is no warning system in place.\n\nItaly\u2019s Fondazione Montagna Sicura (Safe Mountain Foundation) wrote on Facebook: \u201cFrom 19.30pm today, the municipal road of Val Ferret will be closed \u2013 between the locations Montitaz and Planpincieux \u2013 and the road for the location for the potential glacial risk linked to the glacier of Planpincieux.\u201d\n\nAcross the Alps, there is concern warmer temperatures are increasing the danger of melting permafrost and disappearing glaciers.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organisation warned in a new report released this week that if average temperatures continue to rise at current levels, the ice in the eastern and central areas of the Alps could disappear completely within two or three decades. Year-round glaciers would remain only in the western Alps, which are the tallest part of the mountain range.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "description": "An enormous glacier on the Italian side of Mont Blanc, Europe\u2019s highest mountain, is at risk of collapse, causing authorities to close roads and evacuate Alpine huts.
