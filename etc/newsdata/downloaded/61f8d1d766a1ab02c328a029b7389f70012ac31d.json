And we\u2019re told, \u201cWell, the ChiComs have this gigantic market over there, Rush, 1.2 billion customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are sidling up to the most repressive anti-free speech, anti-freedom regime you can find on the planet today,\u201d he continued. \u201cCommunist China! Over one tweet by a general manager for the Houston Rockets supporting Hong Kong freedom fighters! Remember when the one guy stood up in front of the tank at Tiananmen Square, remember everybody stood up and loved that guy? This would be the equivalent if the NBA said, \u2018Put that guy in jail!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the NBA and the Democrat Party and the media said, \u2018Run him over! Run over that guy, he\u2019s insulting our brethren in the Chinese communist government.\u2019 That\u2019s the equivalent. They\u2019ve done a 180 off Tiananmen Square. And that guy who was celebrated as a hero, if that happened today, he\u2019d be lynched. And the NBA and all of these communist Chinese loving American enterprises would be demanding that guy be made an example of. \u2026 Well, we all know why. It\u2019s money. Once again, money trumping ideas. Too much money to be made there in China.\u201d\n\nMr. Limbaugh also said that it was telling how the NBA waded into issues regarding transgender bathroom laws and other LGBT issues, but the league says nothing about China\u2019s record on those issues.\n\n\u201cDo you know what China does to transgender people?\u201d the host asked. \u201cDo you know what China does to homosexuals? Do you know where those people end up in China? They end up in reeducation camps with the Uyghurs.\u201d\n\nNBA Chief Communications Officer Mike Bass released a statement on Monday saying Mr. Morey\u2019s opinion on Hong Kong protesters \u201cdoes not represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
