But increasingly it comes with serious risks, from transcript leaks to domestic political blowback, and advisers are growing wary.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A section of the report from the U.S. intelligence community whistleblower to the U.S. House Intelligence Committee where the whistleblower refers to whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy would \"play ball\" is seen after being released by the committee in Washington, U.S., September 26, 2019. REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File Photo\n\nThe fallout from Trump\u2019s July 25th call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is still reverberating in Kiev and has led to the opening of an impeachment inquiry in Washington.\n\nU.S. lawmakers leading the inquiry now want access to Trump\u2019s calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and some other world leaders, with the chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee citing concerns that Trump may have jeopardized national security.\n\n\u201cPeople have to adjust to the fact that a phone call with Trump is not the same as a phone call with any normal leader,\u201d said Gerard Araud, the French ambassador in Washington until last June, who helped organise a number of calls between President Emmanuel Macron and the White House.\n\nFor any world leader who has spoken to Trump, the idea that verbatim transcripts could be released is a worrying prospect and likely to alter how such calls \u2014 a lifeblood of international diplomacy \u2014 play out in the future.\n\nYet Araud suggested leaks were perhaps the least of leaders\u2019 concerns, citing Trump\u2019s tendency to veer into unexpected territory, destabilising his interlocutor.\n\n\u201cIf you want to make progress on policy, that\u2019s a real problem. Every head of state and government has had to adjust to this non-dialogue,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEverything has been blown out of the water.\u201d\n\nGREATER CARE\n\nThe warning signs were arguably there from the beginning.\n\nA few days after Trump took office in January 2017, he held a call with then Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. At one point in the testy exchange Trump told Turnbull \u201cYou\u2019re worse than I am\u201d, and complained that a U.S. migration deal with Australia \u201cshows me to be a dope\u201d.\n\nThe transcript was leaked to the Washington Post and caused Turnbull, who stood up to Trump during the call, problems at home for his staunch anti-immigration line.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Justice Department confirmed Trump had held calls with leaders other than Zelenskiy to ask them to help Attorney General William Barr with his wide-ranging inquiry into the origins of Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe leaders were not named, but Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed he had spoken to Trump about it. The British government said Trump spoke to Prime Minister Boris Johnson the day after Trump and Zelenskiy spoke, listing unrelated themes.\n\nA phone call with U.S. president used to be like hitting the jackpot for world leaders but Trump had turned that idea on its head, said Jonathan Eyal, the international director of the Royal United Services Institute.\n\n\u201cGetting the president on the phone is very risky. It is very difficult to avoid these calls, but there will be a greater care among heads of government now in what they say to Trump.\u201d\n\nNOT SO GOOD TO TALK\n\nCalls between leaders involve hours of preparation and briefing beforehand, with advisers drawing up introductory remarks, talking points, responses to challenging issues that might crop up and specific policies where cooperation is sought.\n\nA number of people will be listening in, some taking minutes and producing a transcript that is circulated to relevant government departments so that action can be taken afterwards.\n\nA former prime minister of an EU country said if he were talking to Trump now, he would be extremely wary of straying off topic, even if that meant failing to strike up a good rapport with Trump, who tends to look for common ground \u2014 like talking about golf \u2014 and uses very familiar language.\n\n\u201cOf course you want to have good relations with the president of the United States, but in the current environment you would want to stick to the script and keep it very dry,\u201d the former leader said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid colouring his country\u2019s ties with the United States.\n\nA senior diplomat who often plans and listens on calls between his prime minister and other world leaders said leaks were always a concern, but partisan politics is a new risk.\n\n\u201cThese are important set-piece events \u2014 you want to get the call right, make your points and progress the relationship,\u201d the official said. \u201cThat\u2019s become harder (with Trump). It\u2019s less predictable. Your careful planning can be thrown off course with an unexpected remark.\u201d\n\nHe said those talking to Trump needed to be businesslike and \u201cjust the facts\u201d, avoiding exchanges like Zelenskiy\u2019s, in which the Ukrainian at times comes across as almost fawning.\n\nAraud underscored that point, saying he had advised Macron to avoid responding to Trump\u2019s provocations.\n\n\u201cMy advice to Macron, on Twitter at least, was not to react, because Trump will double down and you will lose.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s relations with the United States are still affected by the leak to a British newspaper in July of a cable highly critical of Trump written by Kim Darroch, the former British ambassador to Washington.\n\nTrump responded by calling Darroch \u201cwacky\u201d and \u201cvery stupid\u201d on Twitter. The ambassador resigned days later.\n\n\u201cDiplomats can\u2019t really do their job if there is a significant risk of their honest, unfiltered judgements being leaked to the media,\u201d said Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to Washington and Paris.\n\n\u201cDiplomats need to know that this has not become the new normal.\u201d", "description": "Arranging a phone call with the president of the United States used to be seen as a diplomatic win.
