Three little children are gone forever,\" said Cruz, who also noted it appears they died of gunshot wounds.\n\nHe said there is no threat to the public but would not elaborate further on what happened, saying it's still under investigation.\n\nThe district attorney's office identified the deceased as 40-year-old Deirdre Zaccardi, 43-year-old Joseph Zaccardi, 11-year-old Alexis Zaccardi and 9-year-old twins Nathaniel and Kathryn Zaccardi.\n\nLaw enforcement officers work outside a home where two adults and three children were found dead with gunshot wounds on Monday, Oct. 7, 2019, in Abington, Mass.
