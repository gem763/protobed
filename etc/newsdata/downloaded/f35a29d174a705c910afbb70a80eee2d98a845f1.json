One person we were lucky enough to have in was Sir Alex Ferguson,\u201d Jones said. \u201cOne of the things his teams were renowned for was... what do they call it? Fergie time. Fergie time!\n\n\u201cAnd the message was be patient and that\u2019s what I enjoyed about our team \u2013 there was no sign of panic and they kept on playing good rugby and the try came.\n\n\u201cIt might have been easier if it had come a little bit earlier, but it came and that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d\n\nJones put a positive spin on England\u2019s struggle to dispatch opponents ranked 15th in the world who operate on a fraction of the resources, leading to their top stars being lured away by richer nations and European clubs. Had it not been for their centre of Samoan heritage Manu Tuilagi, who crossed twice, they may have been in trouble.\n\nBilly Vunipola is unbowed after facing the music in Tonga\u2019s hit parade | Andy Bull Read more\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really pleased. We came here to get five points and we got five points. We\u2019ve got no injuries and we know we can play better,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cSometimes rugby is like that and the ball just doesn\u2019t stick. We left a number of points out there. But I\u2019m so pleased with the attitude of the players.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s two Tests in a row that we haven\u2019t conceded a try. We know we can be better and that\u2019s the goal for the USA game (on Thursday).\n\n\u201cThe stadium was unbelievable. What a great thing for rugby. We\u2019re up in Hokkaido, closer to Russia than you probably want to be.\n\n\u201cYou have Tonga, a country of 100,000 people battling their heart out, playing tough.\u201d\n\nTuilagi indicated he will be England\u2019s greatest asset at this World Cup with a powerful display that scattered Tongan tacklers time and again, putting more distance between himself and years of injury troubles.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/22/billy-vunipola-england-tonga-rugby-world-cup-pool-c\n\n\u201cManu\u2019s increasingly getting close to his best. He\u2019s training well and is in great physical nick. He enjoys being around the boys,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThe boys love playing with him and for a Samoan to play against Tongan it\u2019s a pretty special occasion. Manu will only get better as the tournament goes on.\u201d\n\nThe Tonga captain Siale Piutau started opposite Tuilagi and acknowledged that his strength was too much to handle. \u201cManu was instrumental for them. We knew they\u2019d go to him for their go forward and he did that,\u201d Piutau said. \u201cWe tried to contain him but when you have someone of Manu\u2019s talent that gives you gainline, it helps get your forwards into the game.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones admitted England needed \u2018Fergie time\u2019 to ensure their World Cup title quest began with a bonus-point victory over Tonga", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18ece0e0c852e99d60aa89e3e74089eed9a79e67/0_0_4081_2449/master/4081.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=944403619ccd0ee3eb7b8fe787470170", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
