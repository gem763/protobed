Production of goods, transportation and services, including health and the media, are in a constant state of disruption and innovation,\" the report said.\n\n\"Many current job roles will become redundant, particularly in areas of standardised and routine production and service delivery. But new roles are also emerging, roles that place a premium on human aptitudes and capabilities, including the ability to understand, shape, interpret and reshape the use of technology.\"\n\nSee also: 56% of employees lack digital skills needed for future jobs (TechRepublic)\n\nThe report also recommended that shorter form credentials -- or microcredentials -- are used for upskilling and reskilling within the education system and the workplace.\n\nIn addition, the review recommended that senior secondary students should be able to study subjects at school that count towards a vocational training qualification or university degree.\n\nThe recommendations have been welcomed by industry body Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA).\n\n\"We support the Government's initiative and this type of innovative thinking to address the digital skills gap,\" AIIA CEO Ron Gauci said.\n\n\"Promoting great fluidity and equal value between VET, higher education and schools through microcredentials will encourage students to combine digital skills with business courses and hands-on experience.\n\n\"The government is clearly listening to the industry and responding to its needs by considering reforms that will create new opportunities for Australian students.\"\n\nMinister for Education Dan Tehan said the government would now consider the review and respond in due course.\n\n\"This review will help Australia reshape its qualifications architecture to better serve students and meet the demands of the modern economy,\" he said\n\n\"Allowing students to earn qualifications across VET and higher education based on their learning requirements better reflects the value that both streams of education provide.\"\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nNAB and La Trobe partner to lift Australia's cyber capabilities\n\nThe university and the bank have formed a 'strategic alliance' to deliver cybersecurity-focused research, teaching, and workforce development\n\nMicrosoft extends IT skills development program to South Australia\n\nThe Microsoft Traineeship Program, already launched in New South Wales, will expand to South Australia in September.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nNew research centre receives AU$62m to study children's digital lives\n\nThe ARC Centre of Excellence for the Digital Child will examine the digital lives of Australian children from birth to eight years old.\n\nWestern Australia launches its first STEM skills strategy\n\nTo create a globally competitive and STEM-fluent workforce in Western Australia.", "description": "The recommendation comes as part of a review into the country's qualifications framework across higher education, vocational education and training (VET), and senior secondary schools.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/10/8cbf3b7f-8f9c-4229-a47a-75546c564249/thumbnail/770x578/1941f3cd5a46e849c3c47d020a45660a/istock-499449917.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
