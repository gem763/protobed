It cooks up in about 25 minutes, and it\u2019s light, like coarse bulgur, which it resembles, except that the color is darker and greener.\n\nBut freekeh has a more complex flavor than bulgur. What stands out is its smokiness, a result of the production process, in which durum wheat \u2014 the type used for many pastas \u2014 is harvested while still green and soft, and carefully roasted in the husk over open fires. The wheat is beaten to remove the chaff, and in the Middle East it is sold whole or cracked.\n\nThe cracked version is what you\u2019re more likely to find here in the United States, and happily it\u2019s become easy to do so. Look on the shelves of Middle Eastern markets, at whole-food markets or online. Cracked freekeh is tastier and easier to work with than whole freekeh. Add it to soups or stews, or use in the same way you would use rice or bulgur.\n\nThe cracked wheat has a grassy, herbal quality that also makes it great for use in lemony salads like this one, in which the freekeh is tossed with chickpeas, scallions and a welcome dash of bright green in the form of fresh mint and parsley.\n\nFeatured in: Get Your Freekeh On.\n\nLearn: How to Make Salad", "description": "There is a lot to love about freekeh, an earthy grain that I\u2019d like to see catch on in more kitchens It cooks up in about 25 minutes, and it\u2019s light, like coarse bulgur, which it resembles, except that the color is darker and greener But freekeh has a more complex flavor than bulgur", "authors": ["Martha Rose Shulman", "Christine Muhlke", "Melissa Clark", "Julia Moskin", "Alison Roman", "Eric Asimov"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/21/dining/21MARTHA/21MARTHA-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "published_at": "2015-01-21"}
