To change that it recommends the introduction of \"standardised benefit packages\" (SBPs) that every medical aid will have to offer, and that every member must sign up for.\n\nThese packages will be an expansion of current minimum prescribed benefits that will cover \"catastrophic expenditure as well as some level of out-of-hospital and primary care,\" the regulator said, and will be identical for everyone with private medical insurance in South Africa.\n\nWhere the SBP list specifies the treatment of a condition, the Commission said, \"these will be considered the minimum requirements schemes must provide to members, thereby creating scope for schemes to offer better quality treatment\".\n\nBut while schemes can offer better levels of treatment for conditions, they would be banned from adding more conditions to the SBP.\n\n'Supplementary packages' on top of basic cover will be priced on how risky your health is.\n\nIf they want to cover anything beyond the standard base package, medical aids will have to create \"supplementary packages\" that are offered on top of the SBP \u2013 with separate pricing.\n\nMedical aids should be allowed to create an unlimited number of such extra packages, the Competition Commission said, creating modules that can be bolted on to the basic package.\n\nCrucially, provided that the basic package is comprehensive enough, the bolt-on options would be risk-rated, making them more expensive for high-risk members than for those at lower risk, such as young, healthy members.\n\nNew geographic medical aid schemes will offer cover specific to a region \u2013 with deals specific to local clinics and hospitals.\n\nThe Competition Commission recommends that geographically-based medical aids should be encouraged, to the extent of creating a special reinsurance system to help them get off the ground.\n\nMedical aids based in a specific part of the country would be able to \"take into account variations in population, disease burden, and delivery of care models,\" the body says.\n\nSuch schemes could perhaps reach deals with local healthcare providers, the regulator suggests.\n\nMedical aid members who pay brokers for their services will have to confirm those payments every year, and it will come out of their pockets.\n\nMedical schemes should still be able to pay brokers who help them win members, the Competition Commission recommends \u2013 but transparently, and only on the ongoing say-so of members.\n\nMedical aids would be forced to detail exactly what they pay brokers, with that information published every year. Members who wish to pay such commission will be \"required\" to declare that decision every year.\n\n\"Members who chose not to use the services of a broker will pay proportionally lower scheme medical fees,\" the Commission said.", "description": "Standard benefit packages (SBPs), geographically-defined schemes, and confirming every year you want to pay a broker are some of the big changes the Competition Commission has recommended on medical aid.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7864/5dc3ff3315f54e019487721c0f43263a.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
