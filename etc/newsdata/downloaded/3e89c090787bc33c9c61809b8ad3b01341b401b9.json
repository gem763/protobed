And, according to the notes: \u201cNot only did Trump definitely ask the president of Ukraine to work with his personal lawyer/vampire henchman [Rudy Giuliani] to investigate Joe Biden, he also tried to rope in the United States attorney general,\u201d said Trevor Noah on The Daily Show.\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) Impeachment: the constitutional way to swipe left on a president. Will Trump\u2019s Ukraine call make it happen? pic.twitter.com/ibzZvjCioH\n\nThe revelation is a \u201cbig deal\u201d because \u201cthe president can\u2019t just go around using the justice department has his personal TaskRabbit\u201d, Noah added.\n\n\u201cYou might be wondering: if this phone call is so damning, why did Trump even release the transcript? Only an idiot would do that! Exactly, and also this is what Trump does,\u201d Noah explained. \u201cTrump is the only person who would do something so bad, right out in the open, that it makes you question whether it\u2019s actually bad.\n\nNoah was unequivocal on the transcript\u2019s importance. \u201cThis transcript is bad,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as bad as this seems for Trump, this transcript has turned into a political Rorschach test. Democrats see a smoking gun that proves Donald Trump abused his power and deserves to lose his job. Republicans see a man who is innocent and is just passionate about cracking down on corruption in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, he assumed, would quickly spin the call as a \u201cnothingburger\u201d, because there\u2019s no explicit quid pro quo. \u201cBut let\u2019s be honest, you don\u2019t need to be explicit to set up a shady deal,\u201d Noah said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve watched any mafia anythings, you know that explicit is the opposite of what they do.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert\n\n\u201cGet out your compass,\u201d Stephen Colbert said on The Late Show, \u201cbecause we are in uncharted waters. After two and a half years of the Trump presidency, we\u2019ve finally spotted the great orange whale and let me tell you: thar he blows.\u201d\n\nColbert also dove straight into the notes from Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy, released by the White House on Wednesday. The notes, Colbert said, \u201cmake Trump look \u2013 and I don\u2019t want to get too technical \u2013 uh \u2026 bad\u201d.\n\nColbert then summarized the contents of the call. First, Trump congratulated Zelenskiy on his election victory, then immediately reminded him how much Ukraine owes the US. \u201cThe United States has been very good to Ukraine,\u201d Trump said, according to the notes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s reciprocal.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy then discussed Ukraine\u2019s appreciation for military aid, which Trump had delayed prior to the phone call. \u201cZelenskiy says he wants those missiles,\u201d Colbert explained, \u201cand here comes the quid pro quote: Trump immediately says: \u2018I would like you to do us a favor, though \u2026\u2019\u201d\n\nColbert then mimicked a gameshow host announcing a winner in a bit from The Price is Right: \u201cThe phrase that pays the Ukrainian in exchange for political favors. Tell the president what he\u2019s won! It\u2019s protracted impeachment inquiries! A permanent stain on his already shameful legacy, and a lovely Broyhill dinette set.\u201d\n\nIn all seriousness, Colbert pivoted, the meaning of the call seemed clear: \u201c\u2018We do a lot for you, like military help. I need a favor, though: investigate Biden.\u2019 There it is. Pressuring a foreign country to provide dirt to influence our election.\u201d\n\nSamantha Bee\n\nFull Frontal\u2019s Samantha Bee had two words for the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry: \u201cFucking finally!\n\n\u201cLook, I know it\u2019s easy to dismiss the call to Ukraine as just another Trump scandal,\u201d Bee said, \u201cyet no matter how burnt out we feel, we should be as disgusted by Trump trying to pressure foreign powers to investigate his rivals as we are disgusted that Stephen Miller has a girlfriend.\u201d\n\nBee seemed determined to impart the severity of Trump\u2019s abuse of power, even if the administration downplayed it as normal or unremarkable. \u201cToday, Trump and his team were running around like chickens with their heads cut off, but remember: they\u2019re actually very good at shaping the public narrative,\u201d Bee said. \u201cOver the next few weeks and months, we\u2019ll see a lot of people moving the goalposts about what constitutes an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nMany Trump allies, she continued, would express outrage over even considering impeachment proceedings without \u201cfootage of Trump literally exchanging a sack of cash in exchange for dirt on his enemies\u201d.\n\nBut, Bee pointed out, \u201cthreats don\u2019t have to be spelled out to be threats\u201d. For example, she offered: \u201c\u2018Hey tiny country, please look into my rivals\u2019 isn\u2019t an innocent request any more than \u2018Nice pizza joint, shame if anything happened to it\u2019 is a simple, flattering Yelp review.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts sort through the \u2018Trump language\u2019 and \u2018quid pro quotes\u2019 of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57b680987a21d649ed4a014c2eeb35608cf1c264/84_0_1628_977/master/1628.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=17ee643de4b692f4eb267f24d9395d08", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
