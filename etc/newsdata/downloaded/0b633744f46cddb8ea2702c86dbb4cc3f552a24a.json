They aren\u2019t happy, despite having every reason to be so, and therefore nobody else can be happy, either.\n\nTheir arguments for the cancelations run counter to embracing freedom. One argument is that some families don\u2019t celebrate Halloween or want to participate.\n\nHALLOWEEN-LIKE HOLIDAY, 'NATIONAL TRICK OR TREAT DAY,' SPARKS DEBATE ABOUT PROPOSED NEW DATE\n\nWell, if there\u2019s a family that doesn\u2019t want to participate in the Halloween celebration for religious or other reasons, then tell them, \u201cthat\u2019s fine.\u201d Give them the day off or look for some other solution. You don\u2019t need to ruin something for everyone else because one person or a handful of people may not want to participate.\n\nI don\u2019t drink alcohol, but I certainly don\u2019t expect everyone in a restaurant to stop imbibing because I have shown up.\n\nAs for the argument that some kids may not be able to afford costumes, well, you are school and supposed to be teaching creativity and problem-solving, so isn\u2019t there some other solution you can come up with other than canceling an entire holiday?\n\nWhere does it end? Equality is about being equal under the eyes of the law, not everyone having exact equal circumstances.\n\nWhy not allow kids in the school to make costumes during an art class or special assembly. Do a community drive for extra costumes. There are so many ways to allow more people to participate in something and enjoy a celebration, so why is the default option cancelation?\n\nAnd, where does it end? Equality is about being equal under the eyes of the law, not everyone having exact equal circumstances.\n\nWill they stop athletic competitions next because not every kid is athletic? Will they go after other holidays and celebrations?\n\nWhy, in a country that is built on freedom, choice and individuality are schools trying to strip out anything that makes people individuals or interesting? This is something you might expect in a communist country, not in America.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nParents and community members need to push back against this nonsense. We can\u2019t expect everyone to stop what they are doing or give up long-standing traditions every time one or a handful of people are uncomfortable or don\u2019t want to participate. --It is sucking the joy out of life for kids and communities.\n\nYou can be respectful of someone\u2019s dissent without having it disrupt everyone else\u2019s lives.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFreedom is meant for people to have different choices, not for conformity.\n\nLife is short -- stop with the tricks and get back to the treats.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CAROL ROTH", "description": "As if the \u201cwoke\u201d ultra-left couldn\u2019t get any more insufferable, they are now going after a primary source of joy for every school-aged kid by canceling Halloween celebrations at school.", "authors": ["Carol Roth", "Carol Roth Is The Creator Of The"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/10/19/694940094001_5617621261001_5617590095001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
