We actually do vertical cultivation,\u201d said Engel.\n\nThe company\u2019s 3-tiered proprietary vertical growing system enables it to maximize efficiency out of its 14-acre facility in Moncton, New Brunswick. The New Brunswick location also makes OGI unique.\n\nOrganiGram is the only major Canadian producer based on the Atlantic coast, giving the company a home field advantage in a region known to be less populated, but with a higher percentage of cannabis consumers when compared to the national average.\n\nOGI also cranks out some of the best yields in the industry. The company touts an annual output of 113,000-kilos, which breaks down to 230 grams per square foot.\n\nIndustry averages hover between 75 grams per square foot and 125 grams per square foot.\n\nWall Street Analysts have taken note\n\nBeacon Securities analyst Russell Stanley says OrganiGram grow operations \u201c\u2026demonstrate continued execution against the company\u2019s expansion plan, setting the stage for significant revenue/EBITDA growth in fiscal 2020.\u201d\n\nStanley notes that OGI reported C$3 million cash its balance sheet last quarter. The analyst\u2019s C$15 price target implies a one-year upside of 220% for OGI shares.\n\nCIBC analyst John Zamparo says, \u201cThe company offers one of the few opportunities to gain exposure to the cannabis space at a reasonable price. We believe Organigram has a demonstrated track record of profitability, a rarity in the cannabis sector.\u201d\n\nZamparo initiated coverage of OGI at C$9, suggesting a 92% upside.\n\nRaymond James analyst Rahul Sarugaser anticipates OGI\u2019s net revenues will increase from $97 million in fiscal 2019 to approximately $552 million in fiscal 2024 (when Canadian cannabis sales are expected to reach $6 billion). The analyst\u2019s EBITDA projection for 2019 is $36 million, and by 2020, he expects it to reach $87 million.\n\nOrganiGram Holdings Inc. (OGI) was trading at $3.51 per share on Friday afternoon, down $0.05 (-1.40%). Year-to-date, OGI has declined %, versus a 10.42% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by ETF Daily News covering: OrganiGram Holdings Inc.
