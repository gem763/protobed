But it certainly demonstrates that financial institutions are taking digital currencies like Libra seriously.\n\n\u201cThe terms of engagement for innovations such as Libra must be adopted in advance of any launch,\u201d the FPC said in a statement, The Times reported. \u201cUK authorities should use their powers accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe rules will require digital currency firms to demonstrate the \u201coperational and financial resilience\u201d of payments from sender to recipient.\n\nThe rules also require digital currency providers, like Libra, to provide sufficient information to regulators so that payments can be monitored. In other words, they need to satisfy know your customer and anti-money laundering protocols.\n\nAccording to a report from Reuters, the BoE\u2018s FPC said that it will enact the \u201cprinciples by applying existing supervisory \u2018tools,\u2019 rather than resorting to new rules\u201d entirely.\n\nThis likely won\u2019t cause too much stress for Facebook on top of what it\u2019s already facing.\n\nEarlier this week, Hard Fork reported that Facebook will face further grilling from EU regulators to answer questions about the risks posed by the project.\n\nSpecifically Facebook will have to clarify how it plans to be financially stable, prevent money laundering, and secure data.\n\nThe Bank of England isn\u2019t exactly throwing Libra any curveballs here, but it\u2019s certainly another hurdle to overcome.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
