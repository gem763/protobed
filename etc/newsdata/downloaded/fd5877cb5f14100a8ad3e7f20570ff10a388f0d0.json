Photo: William B. Plowman/NBC via Getty Images\n\nMark Sanford, the former South Carolina governor and congressman, announced Sunday that he\u2019ll become the third Republican to challenge Donald Trump for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination. Like the other two, Sanford is an extreme long shot, but that didn\u2019t stop Trump from lobbing an attack over his affair with a woman he incorrectly described as a \u201cflaming dancer.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Trump mocked Sanford for losing his congressional seat in a GOP primary last year (Trump endorsed his opponent, who went on to lose to a Democrat) and for his infamous \u201chike\u201d on the Appalachian Trail a decade ago.\n\nWhen the former Governor of the Great State of South Carolina, @MarkSanford, was reported missing, only to then say he was away hiking on the Appalachian Trail, then was found in Argentina with his Flaming Dancer friend, it sounded like his political career was over. It was,.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\n...but then he ran for Congress and won, only to lose his re-elect after I Tweeted my endorsement, on Election Day, for his opponent. But now take heart, he is back, and running for President of the United States. The Three Stooges, all badly failed candidates, will give it a go! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\nDespite serving several terms in Congress in the \u201990s, two terms as South Carolina\u2019s governor, and then returning to Congress in 2011, Sanford is still best known for disappearing from Columbia for a week in the summer of 2009. At the time, his staff explained he was on a hiking trip. That wasn\u2019t true. Sanford, who was married at the time, was in Argentina with his \u201csoul mate,\u201d Maria Bel\u00e9n Chapur.\n\nTrump, a man who\u2019s bragged about his own infidelity, appears to believe Chapur was a \u201cflaming dancer,\u201d which might be a misspelling of \u201cflamingo dancer,\u201d which might be what Trump thinks \u201cflamenco dancers\u201d are called. But as CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale notes, there\u2019s no evidence Chapur has ever been a flamenco dancer.\n\nSanford joins former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld and former tea party congressman Joe Walsh in the Republican primary against Trump. And while none of them has much of a chance to dent Trump\u2019s support, Sanford said Monday that, as a bloc, the \u201cThree Stooges,\u201d as Trump labeled them this morning, send a powerful message.\n\n\u201cI think it strengthens it. What the administration is basically said \u2014 what the Trump campaign has said is: it was just Bill Weld for a while, it\u2019s a voice crying in the wilderness, it\u2019s \u2014 pay it no attention. All of a sudden, when you end up with three candidates and three different candidates saying there\u2019s something wrong with this presidency, what\u2019s going on here is not consistent with the Republican Party that we know about, believe in and invested major portions of our life in, that\u2019s a different conversation,\u201d Sanford told CNN\u2019s John Berman on \u201cNew Day.\u201d\n\nSanford\u2019s being optimistic. It\u2019s not clear that anyone in a position of power within the Republican Party is eager to get rid of Trump. And it\u2019s abundantly clear that his main issues \u2014 the debt and deficit \u2014 don\u2019t matter at all to today\u2019s GOP. But as someone known for a quixotic journey that turned into a high-profile public embarrassment, Sanford doesn\u2019t have anything to lose.", "description": "Mark Sanford is the third Republican to launch a bid to primary Trump.
