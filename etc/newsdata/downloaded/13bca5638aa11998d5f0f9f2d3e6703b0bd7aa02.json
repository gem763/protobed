(Gerry Angus/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays had a busy trade deadline, but apparently they just missed out on making a significant deal involving Ken Giles.\n\nAccording to Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic, the team got very close to moving their star closer:\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOn the day of the trade deadline, the Yankees and Blue Jays made significant progress on a deal that would have sent reliever Ken Giles to New York, according to major-league sources. The Jays were set to receive three prospects, and informed the other clubs pursuing Giles they were going to be moving him elsewhere. The trade, of course, never happened, and the Yankees backed off too late for the Jays to complete a deal with another club.\n\nThis development adds intrigue to a deadline that was full of it for the Blue Jays. After trades for Marcus Stroman and Aaron Sanchez failed to impress many in baseball circles, it\u2019s worth wondering how a Giles deal would have fared in the court of public opinion.\n\nOf course, without having an idea of the return (\u2018three prospects\u2019 could be an amazing package or a dreadful one) there isn\u2019t any meaningful speculation to be done here. It\u2019s possible the Blue Jays missed out on an extremely advantageous deal. It\u2019s also plausible that they dodged a bullet.\n\nWhat might cause some eyebrow raising is the idea that they told other clubs Giles was on the move before a deal was signed and sealed. It seems like they may have cost themselves an opportunity by being overconfident in the probability of the Yankees deal.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, to use that as the basis of overt criticism would be a bit of a stretch without more information. Perhaps the offers made by the other teams weren\u2019t nearly worth trading Giles for. Perhaps the Yankees misled the Blue Jays about how done the deal was. Without further details, rendering a judgement seems premature.\n\n[Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Football league for free today]\n\nThe good news for the Blue Jays is that whether they missed an opportunity by failing to move Giles or not, they will have the chance to do so either in the off-season or at the 2020 trade deadline. If they trade him at either of those times - and receive a solid return - this footnote will be relegated to the dustbin of history.\n\nIf Giles gets hurt or becomes ineffective, and they\u2019re never able to extract anything of value for him, this trade to the Yankees that wasn\u2019t will seem far more significant.\n\nMore Blue Jays coverage from Yahoo Sports Canada", "description": "Ken Giles almost found himself wearing pinstripes at the end of July.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DffYQxnT3Uxw0Cp7vXjpQQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02OTkuNzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0Qr0OuVmHVsU5irJUWlBhw--~B/aD03Njg7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/89d70000-ce5d-11e9-9fef-d52829e844dc"}
