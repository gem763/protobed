The law allows a local agency to conduct inspections and issue citations if hotels do not comply. A first violation carries a $500 fine and a second carries a $2,000 fine.\n\nThe law makes California \u201cthe first state in the country to accelerate more sustainable alternatives in hotel and lodging industry,\u201d said Ash Kalra, the Democratic state assemblyman who wrote the bill. \u201cWe have reached a tipping point for action and more needs to be done that transitions consumers and businesses towards more sustainable alternatives. Given our state\u2019s large presence in tourism, this will be a model for the nation.\u201d\n\nMany hotels have jumped on board with the law\u2019s goals. Marriott International is aiming to eliminate small plastic bottles at all its hotels by December 2020, while IHG, the owner of Holiday Inn and other hotels, plans to eliminate close to 200 million small bottles by 2021.", "description": "California governor\u00a0Gavin Newsom on Wednesday announced that he has signed a law banning hotels from providing guests with the\u00a0small, disposable plastic bottles containing personal-care products such as shampoo and conditioner that are a common staple of the industry.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "A.
