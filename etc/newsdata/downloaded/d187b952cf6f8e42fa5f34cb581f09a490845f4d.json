It\u2019s kind of boring, actually.\n\nBut in this case, boring is brilliant. Really.\n\nI\u2019m in the process of writing a new book to teach young investors how to maximize the probability that they\u2019ll have more than enough money to live well in retirement. The heart of the book is made up of a dozen short chapters, each one detailing what I call a small step with a big payoff.\n\nEvery one of these steps has the potential to add $1 million to their eventual wealth.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s really amazing: If you invest in a target-date retirement fund, you\u2019ll be taking most of these steps automatically, without any effort.\n\nWarren Buffett said: \u201cYou only have to do a very few things right in your life as long as you don\u2019t do too many things wrong.\u201d In my view, a target-date fund is amply qualified to be among the \u201cfew things right\u201d in the life of an investor.\n\nLet me tell you nine reasons investors should learn to love these boring funds.\n\n1. A single decision is all that\u2019s needed. You don\u2019t have to choose a manager, sort through asset classes or worry about how much risk you should take. Just figure out approximately what year you want to retire, and you\u2019re on your way.\n\n2. You don\u2019t have to worry about how you should respond to whatever the stock market is doing. With the sense that someone else is taking care of that, there\u2019s no reason to panic.\n\n3. Other investors may need to rebalance their assets from time to time \u2014 and many of them will neglect this chore for long stretches. But you won\u2019t. Your target-date fund takes care of that automatically.\n\n4. One of the biggest attributes of target-date funds is the \u201cglide path\u201d that gradually reduces your exposure to equities and tempers your portfolio\u2019s volatility with a gradually increasing stake in bonds. You don\u2019t have to think about this; it will just happen.\n\n5. You won\u2019t need to chase investment fads or try to \u201ctime\u201d the market. If something new comes along that is indisputably valuable, your target-date fund will probably get on board.\n\n6. A target-date fund won\u2019t lead you into risky territory. They tend to be quite conservative, sort of like a stuffy grandfather who wants you to stick to what\u2019s tried and true. This means you don\u2019t have to understand \u2014 or think \u2014 much about risk.\n\n7. The best target-date funds offer lots of diversification by building their portfolios with low-cost index funds. This is beneficial for all sorts of reasons. Not the least of them: It makes it easy to accept that you own some asset classes (think international stocks) that you might not feel comfortable about doing on your own.\n\n8. Target-date funds make it effortless and automatic for you to do several things you should do but that you may not feel like doing.\n\n\u2022 For example, if you\u2019re overly cautious, investing heavily in equities when you are young.\n\n\u2022 For example, if you tend to be aggressive, transitioning to bonds as you get older.\n\n\u2022 For example, if you\u2019re nervous during market volatility, continuing to invest during bear markets.\n\n9. Even the relatively few shortcomings of target-date funds are pretty easy to overcome. One of those shortcomings is an overreliance on large-cap stocks like those in the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.09%.\n\nThis deprives investors of the long-term growth they are likely to get from owning small-cap stocks and value stocks.\n\nHere\u2019s an answer: If you put 90% of your money in a target-date fund and the other 10% into a small-cap value fund, the historical returns suggest you can wind up with anywhere from 10% to 50% more money in retirement. The benefit of supplementing a target-date fund with a small-cap value fund, in fact, is one of the main points of my new book.\n\nYou can learn more at my website.
