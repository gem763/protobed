As Smith later wrote in a piece for the New Yorker, \u201cI had it in my mind to sing the song exactly as it was written and as well as I was capable of doing. I bought a new suit, I trimmed my hair, and felt that I was ready.\u201d And then, two minutes into her performance, catastrophe: Smith forgot the lyrics.\n\nShe appeared to, anyway. \u201cI was simply unable to draw them out,\u201d she wrote. Visibly nervous, and with her voice carrying every wounded note of Dylan\u2019s song, Smith faltered, asked the conductor if she could begin again, and apologized with a crushing, worried smile. The sympathetic audience applauded, and Smith returned to the song.\n\nThat extraordinary moment is noticeably absent from Smith\u2019s new memoir, \u201cYear of the Monkey,\u201d but it\u2019s illustrative of how masterfully the writer and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer can rescue beauty from disaster. Beginning on New Year\u2019s Day 2016 and ending a few days after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration the following January, \u201cYear of the Monkey\u201d is a moving account of the emotional stumbles, physical and intellectual wanderings and deep losses Smith experienced in her 70th year.\n\n\u201cThere was a sense of everyone gone, a J.G. Ballard kind of gone,\u201d Smith writes of a seaside dream she has while staying in a Santa Cruz, Calif., motel called the Dream Inn. Smith harbors this dream and its gray mood throughout the year to come, as old friends fall ill and slip away and the nation faces \u201cthe hyperreality of a polarizing pre-election mudslide, an avalanche of toxicity infiltrating every outpost.\u201d She is haunted by an \u201cinsidious insomnia,\u201d the martial ticking of the clock and the specter of climate change.\n\nUnder the weight of it all, Smith indulges a desire to part with reality. She imagines herself receiving personal messages from the Dream Inn\u2019s sign and holding conversations with a mysterious figure named Ernest, who keeps appearing out of nowhere. \u201cYou\u2019re not a hologram, are you?\u201d Smith asks him, though she\u2019s only half interested in the answer.\n\nA pioneer of punk rock, Smith does not rage against her approaching 70th birthday, nor does she turn away from it. \u201cThe grains pour and I find myself missing the dead more than usual,\u201d she writes. \u201cI notice that I cry more when watching television, triggered by romance, a retiring detective shot in the back while staring into the sea, a weary father lifting his infant from a crib. I notice that my own tears burn my eyes, that I am no longer a fast runner and that my sense of time seems to be accelerating.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe author Patti Smith. (Jesse Dittmar)\n\nNevertheless, she remains Patti Smith, the same rules-shattering poet who opened her 1975 debut album with the declaration, \u201cJesus died for somebody\u2019s sins but not mine,\u201d and the same National Book Award-winning writer whose 2010 memoir \u201cJust Kids\u201d traces her path to becoming a counterculture icon alongside photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. She is, as she writes in the new book, \u201cstill going about my business, that of being alive, the best I [can].\u201d\n\nAs readers of \u201cJust Kids,\u201d \u201cM Train,\u201d \u201cDevotion\u201d and Smith\u2019s other books have learned, that business involves drinking many cups of coffee, watching hours of TV from hotel-room beds, writing in cafes, taking photos with a Polaroid camera and reading tons of books. Smith finds art everywhere, and each of her books offers a welcome look at what has captured her attention. In \u201cYear of the Monkey,\u201d it\u2019s the dystopian television series \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d the music of Pavement, HGTV\u2019s \u201cExtreme Homes\u201d and Roberto Bola\u00f1o\u2019s unfinished novel \u201c2666,\u201d among so much else.\n\nFor Smith, these works provide as much refuge as escape during \u201cYear of the Monkey.\u201d Two important men in her life, record producer-music critic Sandy Pearlman and writer-actor Sam Shepard, are dying, Pearlman from the effects of a cerebral hemorrhage, Shepard from Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. Pearlman is unresponsive during his last months in the hospital, but Smith spends as much time as she can with Shepard at his home in Kentucky, where she helps him to edit his final work of fiction, \u201cThe One Inside.\u201d\n\nAs with most everything else, Smith accepts what has happened to her friends. \u201cI did not ask the fate of Sandy. Or Sam,\u201d she writes. \u201cThose things are forbidden, as entreating the angels with prayer. I know that very well, one cannot ask for a life, or two lives. One can only warrant the hope of an increasing potency in each man\u2019s heart.\u201d\n\nPut another way: Hard rains are going to fall. The secret to enduring them is to know your song well before you start singing.\n\nJake Cline is a writer and editor in Miami.", "description": "In \u201cYear of the Monkey,\u201d the singer revisits her 70th year, when she lost two of her closest friends.", "authors": ["Jake Cline", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2RJ1Kqz2zHA7gmRZOrFdBXjjNII=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TI2G2VWVPII6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
