Jennifer Aniston insisted a reboot of the classic sitcom is not happening, but conceded she and her former castmates are \"working on something.\"\n\nThe subject arose during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Monday, when DeGeneres pressed the \"Morning Show\" star about her recent Instagram post that reunited the entire Friends cast -- Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer -- for the first time in years.\n\n\"Is there going to be a reunion?\" DeGeneres asked point blank.\n\n\"Like a reboot of the show?\" Aniston asked before delivering a flat \"No.\"\n\n\"We would love for there to be something,\" she continued, \"but we don't know what that something is. We're trying. We're working on something.\"\n\n\"A possibility that it's a movie?\" DeGeneres countered.\n\n\"I don't know yet,\" Aniston said, stammering, as if maybe she was holding something back.\n\nSo why were the \"Friends\" actors all hanging out together?\n\n\"We did that because we miss each other and we happened to be in the same part of the world,\" the 50-year-old actress offered.\n\nHowever, the answer didn't fly with DeGeneres, or her other guest, Charlie Puth, who said, \"Sounds to me like there's something in the works.\"\n\nWhen DeGeneres pointed out that it had been years since their last reunion, Aniston quipped \"day, months or even a year,\" referencing the lyrics to the \"Friends\" theme song.\n\nWe'll just have to wait and see.", "description": "Aniston said she and her", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/jennifer-aniston-file-gty-jef-191030_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
