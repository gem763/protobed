USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 You can catch Chris Long, now retired from the NFL, live-tweeting games, contributing to podcasts and pregame shows, and remaining active in various charitable causes important to him.\n\nBut he still thinks about football.\n\nLong is 34 and stays in shape. He played 11 seasons with the St. Louis Rams, New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles, and he told USA TODAY Sports in an interview that he retired in May because he only wanted to play for one team \u2014 the Eagles.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was still playing well and I had some options, but I only wanted to play one place at that juncture,\u201d Long told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cThat was Philly. I said basically that I am going to retire because I would hate to go play somewhere random and then Philly had an injury, because they kind of told me the writing was on the wall.\n\n\"They were going with more of a youth movement. I wasn't part of their plan the same way I had been the past few years, but they'd love to have me back. It seemed like I was going to be more of a player-coach, a reserve\u2019s reserve or somebody who took a lot less snaps.\"\n\n'A MESS': Chris Long says NFL needs to do something about officiating\n\nMORE: Chris Long explains skepticism of Jay-Z partnership, weighs in on NBA's China controversy\n\nFOOTBALL FIX: NFL news and exclusive analysis delivered to your inbox\n\nChris Long celebrates a sack of Texans QB Deshaun Watson during a game last season at Lincoln Financial Field. (Photo: James Lang, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIncluding the postseasons, Long played in all of Philadelphia's 37 games in his two seasons there, though he started just one of them.\n\nLong was an integral part of the 2017 squad that toppled the Patriots in Super Bowl LII. Again including the playoffs, Long accounted for 58 total tackles, 12 sacks, and six forced fumbles.\n\nThe Eagles, as they told Long they would, have invested in younger players at the position. The team has relied upon Derek Barnett, 23 and a 2017 first-round draft pick, as its starting right defensive end. And while veterans Brandon Graham (31) and Vinny Curry (31) remain part of the pass rush, Philadelphia has given more snaps to backup end Josh Sweat, 22.\n\n\u201cI can still play, so for me with everything I have going on off the field, I joked with somebody that if I was 38 and a contender called me in the right situation, I'd consider it,\u201d Long said. \u201cI'd get off the couch if the perfect situation arose, but I'm so entrenched in what I'm doing right now with building a media company, doing this podcast stuff, I've made the transition. It's really hard to get out of that. I can't guarantee you that I would come back.\u201d\n\nLong, in his 11 seasons, compiled 332 tackles, 70 sacks, and 15 forced fumbles.\n\nLong spoke to USA TODAY Sports on behalf of Crown Royal, as part of its Water Break campaign that promotes taking a break from alcohol consumption to drink water to stay hydrated.\n\nHe announced Thursday that he is launching a digital sports network producing athlete- and celebrity-driven content called Chalk Media.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
