D\u2019Allesandro was blunt in his advice: Listen more. Talk less. Answer succinctly. Get your campaign operation organized.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI told him that he\u2019s gotta energize his speeches, and they need to be shorter and more to the point,\u201d D\u2019Allesandro said. \u201cHe\u2019s gotta zero in on things and address them, and address them succinctly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I know that,\u201d Biden replied, according to D'Allesandro.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

But indeed the people want to hear what you are going to do for them.\u201d\n\nOther prominent Democrats in the state agreed with the state senator\u2019s overall critique of Biden, and noted his campaign appears less than organized. For example, key local Democrats were not sent invitations to Friday\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cSome of their events are a cluster f--k,\u201d said a senior Democratic party member who is uncommitted in the primary and asked for anonymity to speak candidly.\n\nSome Biden supporters in Iowa have similar concerns about the candidate and his operation.\n\n\u201cI think Vice President Biden needs to speak less, and listen more, and let people talk,\u201d said Iowa State Senator Tony Bisignano. \u201cWhen you campaign and you knock on a door, what you should be doing is 75 percent talking about them, and hear how they are doing.\u201d\n\nThe criticism comes as Biden\u2019s campaign earlier this week downplayed expectations for both Iowa and New Hampshire, saying neither state is a must-win. While polling shows Biden in the lead in both states, no comprehensive poll has been done in either state for more than a month.\n\nFormer Amb. Terry Shumaker, who has been a Biden supporter since he first worked on his presidential campaign in 1987, said he didn\u2019t have an issue with the campaign lowering expectations in the first two voting states.\n\n\u201cPut yourself in their position,\u201d said former Amb. Terry Shumaker, who has been a Biden supporter since he first worked on his campaign in 1987. \u201cIf you don\u2019t win, then they throw it back at you \u2026 I think it\u2019s being realistic: No one state is essential.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The lion of the state Senate gives some blunt advice to the Democratic frontrunner.", "authors": ["Trent Spiner"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d1/77/4378d295413e9cee03153b524550/20190906-biden-nh-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
