Nothing to do with Svenson at all.\"\n\nPetrovic replied: \"Well no, it was to do with him because he said I was the person that done it as obviously there was pressure on him just as there was pressure on me.\"\n\nHe earlier told the court how a gang on his wing barricaded him in a room before 'jumping' him.\n\nHe said: \"I had a couple of people jump me when I had just come on the wing [of Belmarsh prison].\n\n\"There were people I was associating with, one of them tried closing the door.\n\n\"Two of them tried jumping me. Tried punching me a couple of times, kicked me. One hit me with a tin and it cut my face.\n\n\"When I was at lunch one of the officers grabbed me and they glued the cut on my face.\"\n\nPetrovic, of east London, Ong-a-Kwie, of Romford, a 17-year-old and 16-year-old, both from east London, who cannot be named, deny murdering Jodie.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Manuel Petrovic told jurors a gang of prisoners jumped him at maximum security HMP Belmarsh", "authors": ["Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Swns", "Internet Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20619660.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_MANUEL_PETROVIC_004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
