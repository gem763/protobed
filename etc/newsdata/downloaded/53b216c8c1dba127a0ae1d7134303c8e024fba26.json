This routine really takes me no longer than like 10 minutes.\u2019\n\nThe 22-year-old businesswoman likes to savour the moment because she finds doing her make-up really \u2018therapeutic\u2019 and enjoys doing her make-up while listening to music and drinking wine or coffee.\n\nShe revealed: \u2018My favourite part about doing my make-up is, it\u2019s like a therapeutic moment for me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I turn my music on, if I\u2019m gonna get ready at night I\u2019ll have a glass of wine. Or, I\u2019ll have my coffee if I\u2019m doing it in the morning.\u2019\n\nIt seems as if Kylie\u2019s love for make-up has already inspired daughter Stormi, as the little one is already \u2018super into\u2019 cosmetics.\n\nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashians star said: \u2018Stormi is actually super into make-up right now. It is amazing. Every time I\u2019m wearing lipstick she notices and she looks at me like: \u201cLip! Lip! Lip!\u201d\u2019\n\nBut Ky \u2013 who launched her own make-up brand Kylie Cosmetics back in 2015 \u2013 doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019s going to let Stormi wear products on her face yet.\n\nShe added: \u2018I haven\u2019t even thought about when I\u2019m going to let Stormi wear make-up. I\u2019m going to see, she might not even want to wear make-up. But honestly, with the way things are going though, this girl is obsessed with make-up.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
