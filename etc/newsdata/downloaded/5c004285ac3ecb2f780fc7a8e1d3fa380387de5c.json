It\u2019s being billed as an autobiographical work, though that\u2019s more a matter of approach than of actual content. As the aging filmmaker and onetime provocateur Salvador Mallo, Antonio Banderas has been outfitted with Almod\u00f3var\u2019s colorful shirts and high-tops, and he sports a salt-and-pepper beard and a shock of happy hair not unlike the director\u2019s. The character even lives in Almod\u00f3var\u2019s apartment \u2014 the production reportedly replicated the filmmaker\u2019s own abode \u2014 with its impeccable, vibrant d\u00e9cor, its rainbow curtains and primary-color cabinets and oddball works of art. But then again, most Almod\u00f3var characters have lived in apartments like that; his body of work is rife with surrogates for himself, be they lovesick artists, scorned lovers, or other emotional castaways.\n\nSo Salvador isn\u2019t quite Almod\u00f3var, but a fictional alter ego, a vessel through which the director can confess his doubts and regrets and tie up loose ends. Salvador, at times, seems to be a man built entirely out of memories. When we first see him, he\u2019s submerged in a pool, flashing back to his mom (played by Pen\u00e9lope Cruz) washing clothes and singing alongside some other women by a creek. Then, via a captivating animated sequence, Salvador tells us about his many ailments \u2014 his migraines, his depression, his twisted vertebrae \u2014 and the various methods and medications he uses to control them. This is the pain, presumably. In the same breath, he discusses how his filmmaking career has taken him all over the world and taught him about all the places and countries and towns that he could once only dream about. These are the glories. The question in his mind is how to keep both extremes in line as he grows older, because right now all he\u2019s got, it seems, is pain.\n\nPain and Glory weaves in and out of the past, through varied forms of expression \u2014 paintings, plays, monologues, movies, snatches of literature \u2014 in what is sometimes a mazelike narrative. But fundamentally, the picture has two tracks: In the present, Salvador makes amends with an actor (Asier Etxeandia) with whom he once feuded (some have suggested that this references the long period when Almod\u00f3var and Banderas didn\u2019t work together, but I suspect it owes more to the director\u2019s breakup with the great Carmen Maura, the star of titles like Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown and The Law of Desire), and then promptly gets hooked on heroin, a drug he\u2019d always scoffed at. (Almod\u00f3var once said that, as a cocaine person, he hated when his actors did heroin.) Mixing that with his painkillers and generous helpings of alcohol, Salvador drifts further and further into his memories, particularly the period when his impoverished family moved to a small rural town and had to live in a glorified cave. There, mom hires a local illiterate bricklayer (C\u00e9sar Vicente) to help fix up their catacomb-like home, in exchange for young Salvador teaching the man to read and write. Of course, young Salvador, in the throes of adolescent sexual awakening, becomes fascinated with the hunky bricklayer for other reasons.\n\nThe grown-up Salvador is a man paralyzed both creatively and emotionally \u2014 and, given all his aches and pains, he may be in danger of becoming paralyzed physically as well. And yet creation swirls around him. An early film, now regarded as a classic, is given a restoration and screening. (Salvador and his actor are supposed to attend; instead, they get high at home and call in for the Q&A, which ends in comic disaster.) A stray composition about a long-lost lover becomes a monologue that then prompts a remarkable and tender reunion. At one point, Salvador refuses to loan out two pieces of art he owns for a museum show; later, a supposedly anonymous painting drifts back unexpectedly into his life, prompting another cascade of memories, a reminder from the universe that art is meant to be sent out into the world, not kept hidden away.\n\nThroughout, Banderas shifts his understated performance to play the many roles that Salvador finds himself in: He can be a repentant friend one minute, domineering director the next. In a series of scenes with his ailing mother, we see him go from parent to child then back to parent again. It\u2019s a performance of phenomenal range, but it also feels so unified, so controlled. \u201cBetter not to be an actor who\u2019s always crying, but one who\u2019s always on the verge of tears,\u201d Salvador advises his actor pal at one point, and it\u2019s the kind of advice one might imagine Almod\u00f3var giving. Melodrama has always been in the director\u2019s bones, but he\u2019s resisted the indulgence that comes with it. We rarely find wild, uncontrolled bursts of emotion in an Almod\u00f3var film (there are a few pointed exceptions); instead, what we get is the spectacle of people struggling to hold things back, while the feelings are displaced onto the d\u00e9cor and the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne and the music. Why cry yourself, Almod\u00f3var seems to ask, when this beautiful red pillow can do it for you?\n\nIn his later years, as his work has gone from comic farces and ironic thrillers to more subdued dramas and mysteries, Almod\u00f3var has become the cinematic poet of certain kind of eloquent hesitancy. Each work dances on the edge of abject tragedy and emotional devastation, without ever falling in. Pain and Glory takes things one step further. For all its confessional qualities, for all the vulnerability of Banderas\u2019s performance, the film holds it all together, never quite resolving anything \u2014 until it gets to its closing image, a simple glance between mother and child that fades out as soon as it registers. And then the tears come, like Noah\u2019s flood.", "description": "Pain and Glory, starring Antonio Banderas, is at once the gentlest and most emotionally naked movie Pedro Almod\u00f3var has ever made.
