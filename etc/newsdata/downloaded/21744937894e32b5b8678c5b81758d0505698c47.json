Here\u2019s how Voyager missed it", "language": "en", "text": "When Voyager II flew past Neptune in August of 1989 it revealed a complex system of 13 moons, six of which had never been seen before.\n\nThirty years later, scientists say the space probe missed one.\n\nUsing data from the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have discovered an elusive seventh ice moon around the ice giant that fell just out of Voyager\u2019s field of view. Its new name is Hippocamp.\n\n\u201cVoyager was a little bit unlucky,\u201d said Mark Showalter, a planetary astronomer at the SETI Institute and lead author of a paper describing the moon published Wednesday in Nature. \u201cThere was a number of times when Voyager\u2019s camera came pretty close to seeing it, but missed it, sometimes by as little as 100 pixels.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the flyby, Voyager II did take images of the entire Neptune system, but Hippocamp was too small and faint to be detectable in those pictures, he said.\n\nNeptune is the eighth planet in the solar system and orbits the sun at the staggering distance of 2.8 billion miles. That\u2019s roughly 30 times farther from the sun than the Earth.\n\nIt is so far away that our best space-based telescopes struggle to make out its smaller satellites. Hippocamp does not appear in Hubble images of the Neptune system, even in a lengthy five-minute exposure.\n\n\u201cWe overexpose Neptune by a factor of 50 and even then Hippocamp is below our detection threshold,\u201d Showalter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis 2016 image, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, led astronomers to the discovery of Hippocamp. The moon is visible inside the red box; an enlarged version is inset at upper right. (Mark R. Showalter, SETI Institute)\n\nTo find Hippocamp, scientists used a complex and time-consuming process that allowed them to stack eight Hubble images on top of each other, essentially creating a single, 40-minute exposure.\n\nThey originally invented the process to study the faint arcs, or incomplete rings, around Neptune, but then realized it could be used to detect small, hidden moons as well.\n\n\u201cWe reapplied the analysis to the whole image, and that\u2019s when Hippocamp showed up,\u201d Showatler said.\n\nThis is the earliest image of Hippocamp, obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2004. Hippocamp is shown inside the red box, and an enlarged version is inset at upper right. (Mark R. Showalter, SETI Institute)\n\nThe research team first announced that it had probably found a new moon around Neptune in 2013. Three years later the team was granted some more time on the Hubble Space Telescope to determine its orbit and get a better idea of its size.\n\n\u201cWhen you make a discovery like this you announce it as promptly as possible so the scientific community knows, but that\u2019s really the beginning of the process, not the end,\u201d Showalter said.\n\nSo far, the researchers have determined that if Hippocamp reflects 9% of the sunlight it receives, like Neptune\u2019s other inner moons, then it is probably 20 miles in diameter. They have also concluded that based on its orbit, it was once much closer to Neptune\u2019s much larger moon Proteus, which has been slowly spiraling away from its host planet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat may not sound that helpful, but to the scientists, those two data points suggest an origin story for the small moon.\n\nVoyager II revealed an enormous impact crater on Proteus that suggests that the moon suffered a powerful collision that almost tore it apart 4 billion years ago. That impact would have raised a big cloud of debris, some of which spiraled away into space, and some of which might have formed Hippocamp.\n\nBut this is currently just a guess.\n\n\u201cWhether Hippocamp formed in place from material that did not originate from Proteus or was born of Proteus remains to be determined,\u201d wrote Anne Verbiscer, an astronomer at the University of Virginia, in an essay accompanying the paper.\n\nThe seven inner moons of Neptune are shown to scale, alongside with the planet\u2019s bluish outer edge. (Mark R. Showalter, SETI Institute)\n\nShowalter is an expert at finding small, faint objects that lie great distances from Earth. Over the course of his career he\u2019s discovered six moons in the solar system \u2014 one at Saturn, two at Uranus, two at Pluto and now Hippocamp.\n\nHowever, he thinks it is unlikely that any other hidden objects will emerge at Neptune. The technique he used to find Hippocamp should have revealed any objects at least half as bright as the moon.\n\nBut if we could send a spacecraft out to Neptune, who knows what we might find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are no instruments other than Hubble that are capable of doing these kinds of observations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we could get an orbiter mission to the outer planets, everything we\u2019ve ever done could be improved on in just a few days.\u201d\n\ndeborah.netburn@latimes.com\n\nDo you love science?
