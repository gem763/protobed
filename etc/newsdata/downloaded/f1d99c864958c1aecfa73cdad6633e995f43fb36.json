But this is the first of its kind from one of Scotland\u2019s most celebrated chefs, Tom Kitchin.\n\nBefore, he\u2019s stuck to opening restaurants firmly within Edinburgh: Castle Terrace, Scran & Scallie, the Michelin star The Kitchin and Southside Scran, the newest opening of the Kitchin Group. Sounding a bit like Rick Stein and Padstow to anyone else?\n\nHere, a good 40 minutes outside of Edinburgh city centre, the Bonnie Badger has very \u201cof its time\u201d decor, and by that I mean mid\u2013century. Which is everywhere\u2026 and hardly nouveau either.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not been done well. The beauty of it is thanks to Michaela Kitchin \u2013 business partner and wife of the chef \u2013 with many fabrics being made locally too. Low orange mid\u2013century dark wooden armchairs welcome you in the reception area, while another seating area is the same with greens and greys is super Insta\u2013worthy.\n\nIt was formerly the Golf Inn, a rather tired nondescript pub, surrounded by a huge golf course \u2013 unsurprisingly. But there are rather handsome views over to the water.\n\nIt\u2019s like the countryside you move out to when you\u2019re old enough to have a few kids and keep talking about \"\"needing more outside space\u201d and finding that \u201cforever home\u201d. Although after peering in the estate agents windows, it aint that cheap to buy in Gullane.\n\nDespite it\u2019s easy commutable distance, it still feels a rather remote \u2013 and dated \u2013 actually, making the Bonnie Badger stand out like a sore thumb. But one you want around.\n\nIt's location doesn\u2019t stop people coming. When we go to eat, the whole restaurant is full. Some people seem to be staying \u2013 although there\u2019s only 14 rooms \u2013 and others are obviously coming just to eat (they're the key customers), to celebrate with families and friends. But all seem relatively local, even if they\u2019re from the big city or beyond.\n\nThe dining room \u2013 the old stables, which has kept it\u2019s name \u2013 is an impressive double height room. During the renovations they found the original ceiling and removed the false one. Chairs are covered with faux fur skins, and there\u2019s more mid century furniture with a Scandi feel, with muted tones. It\u2019s cosy, but aesthetically cool.\n\nJust like the interiors that do little to steer away from trends, the menu is much like Kitchin\u2019s other restaurants. It\u2019s traditional pub fair with plenty of Scottish and French touches, but modern.\n\nIn the kitchen its head chef Matthew Budge, alongside Kitchin, and of course the menu tells of all things seasonal and local (that\u2019s easy in Scotland and being near the water) with sustainable fish, so no surprises there. But it does take pride in cutting out the middle man and supporting small businesses \u2013 hear, hear.\n\nThere\u2019s actually two menus (no not a tasting menu): a classics section and an a la carte. From the former to start dishes include Cullen sink, Loch Fyne oysters and haggis neeps and tattis. But don\u2019t think these are bog-standard and are simply just a lump of haggis and some root vegies. Instead, it\u2019s a perfectly formed, deep fried ball, sitting on a little pureed potato and topped with courgetti-like strips of turnip.\n\nWhile the roe deer terrine \u2013 a pleasing richly gamey large portion with fresh apricot slices \u2013 comes from the a la carte menu and sits alongside the likes of dressed crab with avocado and toast, and king scallops with pea purree. It\u2019s not reinventing the wheel \u2013 but as the saying goes, if it aint broke, don\u2019t fix it.\n\nThe mains follow the same pattern. The classics include Aberdeen Angus burger, fish and chips, steak pie and bone marrow, ham egg and chips and homemade beef sausages and mash which comes with a bloody cracking onion gravy \u2013 the thick and sweet type that can almost stand a spoon. It\u2019s, er, classics, but done well.\n\nThe monkfish wrapped in pancetta with coco beans from the a la carte is oh\u2013so salty as if someone in their 80s was let loose with the salt when it was plated up. Order the roast carrots with honey and mustard side and you\u2019ll never look at carrots the same way ever again. I promise. Finish up with a chocolate fondant pud and you'll go home with a smile on your face.\n\nIt\u2019s a breath of fresh air to the area, both for those who don\u2019t want to venture into town for good grub, and a reason for others to come here. It\u2019s made itself a destination restaurant with great rooms \u2013 even better bathrooms and breakfast, so it\u2019s also worth staying over too. And best of all, it\u2019s also a new hangout for locals. Hats off to the Kitchins. Your formula seems to be unbreakable.\n\nFood \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nService \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nValue \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nThe Bonnie Badger, Main St, Gullane EH31 2AB: 01620 621111; bonniebadger.com", "description": "Restaurants with rooms are nothing new in 2019.
