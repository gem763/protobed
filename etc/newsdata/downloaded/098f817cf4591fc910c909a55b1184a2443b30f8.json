Trump\u2019s appointment of Kavanaugh cemented the Supreme Court\u2019s 5-4 conservative majority.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to ask about this, and we\u2019ll see where it goes from there,\u201d Nadler said.\n\nNo Supreme Court justice has ever been ousted from office through the impeachment process set out under the U.S. Constitution in which the House initiates proceedings and the Senate then holds a trial on whether to remove an individual from office. The only justice ever impeached in the House was spared in the Senate in 1804.\n\nWhile Democrats control the House, Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans control the Senate, making it highly unlikely Kavanaugh would ever be removed.\n\nNadler said his panel\u2019s jurisdiction over Kavanaugh could center around whether the jurist lied to the Senate during his contentious confirmation hearings last year.\n\nThe FBI investigated allegations against Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct dating to the 1980s in a background check and sent a report to the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation process. Kavanaugh denied those accusations. Kavanaugh on Monday declined to comment on the latest allegation.\n\n\u2018ASSAULTED BY LIES\u2019\n\nTrump and other Republicans rejected the calls for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment. Trump encouraged Kavanaugh to sue for libel. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, vowed Kavanaugh would not be impeached.\n\n\u201cThe one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh - Assaulted by lies and Fake News!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, called the Times story \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and said the Democratic presidential candidates were \u201chysterically\u201d calling for impeachment.\n\nThe Times reported that a Yale classmate, Max Stier, saw Kavanaugh \u201cwith his pants down\u201d at a drunken dormitory party \u201cwhere friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\u201d The Times said the female student declined to be interviewed and that her friends said she does not recall the incident.\n\nThe claim was similar to a previous allegation by Kavanaugh\u2019s former Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez that Kavanaugh exposed his penis to her during a drunken party. Another woman, Christine Blasey Ford, in Senate testimony accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault in 1982 when they were high school students.\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent House member on the left, joined in the impeachment demands.\n\n\u201cIt is unsurprising that Kavanaugh, credibly accused of sexual assault, would lie under oath to secure a Supreme Court seat. Because sexual assault isn\u2019t a crime of passion - it\u2019s about the abuse of power,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.\n\nA second impeachment inquiry could further expose divisions within the Democratic Party. Some moderate Democrats already have told party leaders they fear that a focus on impeaching Trump instead of on issues important to voters such as healthcare could hurt Democratic election prospects in November 2020.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) leads Democratic members of the committee in a statement to reporters following the committee\u2019s vote to adopt a resolution allowing it to designate hearings as impeachment proceedings against President Trump, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. September 12, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nDemocrat Chris Coons, a Senate Judiciary Committee member, said he sent a letter to the FBI\u2019s Wray expressing concern that the agency\u2019s Kavanaugh investigation was \u201cvery narrow and very limited in its analysis.\u201d Coons told Fox News his letter asked \u201cfor more clarity about why they didn\u2019t interview more people.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates calling for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment included: former U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker; South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and former U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nOthers, including front-runner Joe Biden, the former vice president, stopped short of advocating impeachment. Instead, they called either for an investigation into the new claim or a review of whether Trump\u2019s administration blocked the FBI from following leads during its Kavanaugh background investigation.", "description": "The chairman of the U.S. congressional committee responsible for launching any impeachment efforts said on Monday he is focused on investigating President Donald Trump, signaling that calls by some fellow Democrats for impeaching Trump's Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh would have to take a back seat.", "authors": ["Susan Cornwell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430596133&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1P0", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
