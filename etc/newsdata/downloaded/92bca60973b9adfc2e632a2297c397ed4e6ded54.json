Khan added that he had \u201cheard that some 400 ministerial-level people had been convicted on charges of corruption and put behind jail in the last five years in China.\u201d\n\nKhan claimed that legal proceedings in Pakistan were \u201cvery cumbersome\u201d and it was, therefore, difficult to purge politicians the way that Xi had done using his totalitarian powers.\n\n\u201cI wish I could follow President Xi\u2019s example and put 500 corrupt people in Pakistan in jail.\u201d he continued, explaining that corruption was one of the biggest impediments to investment in the country.\n\nFollowing his rise to power in 2012, Xi launched an anti-corruption crusade that saw around 1.3 million people, ranging from the Communist Party elite down to local officials, charged with a variety of crimes. Among those detained and disappeared into prison were many political rivals within the Party.\n\nKahn, the former cricketer turned politician, went on to effusively praise China\u2019s achievements over the past few decades, with more than half the population lifted out of poverty and becoming the second-largest economy in the world.\n\n\u201cWhat inspires me most about China is the way they have lifted 700 million people out of poverty in 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has never happened in human history.\u201d\n\nChina has historically been a close ally of Pakistan. Beijing celebrated Khan\u2019s election after he ran on a campaign of improving relations with both China and India by promising to resolve tensions over the disputed Kashmir region.\n\nIt is the second time that Khan has visited China in the space of a year. The Pakistani prime minister made his first official visit in November last year. During that visit, he made no secret of his admiration for the communist regime, declaring that he wanted to \u201clearn\u201d from the country\u2019s \u201cphenomenal achievements.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur country is very impressed with the way China has progressed. China\u2019s phenomenal achievements are worth emulating. No other country has tackled poverty and corruption the way China has tackled it,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cPakistan wants to learn from China\u2019s experience in poverty alleviation and curbing corruption.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Imran Khan said he would like to follow the example of Chinese leader Xi Jinping by launching a mass corruption crackdown.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Imran-Khan-in-china-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
