You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nTheir losses will be heavy and made worse by the fact that the market will see the fund coming and act accordingly. The forced seller always gets burned.\n\n\u201cThis was Link\u2019s decision and one I cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests of LF Woodford Equity Income fund investors,\u201d said Woodford, alluding to that.\n\nHowever, his investors could be forgiven for asking whether he\u2019s the right man to be commenting on what\u2019s in their interests.\n\nReopening the fund, which has been suspended since June, was, in reality, always a pipe dream.\n\nHad it happened, the inevitable result would have been a fresh stampede for the exit, continuing on from the one that forced the suspension of dealings in the first place.\n\nThere was more bad news for the investment industry\u2019s one time wunderkind from Woodford Patient Capital, the investment trust he stewards. The fund is a big investor in it, and the news that BlackRock will be selling its holdings immediately created a stock overhang and caused the trust\u2019s shares to plummet.\n\nWoodford Patient is currently \u201creviewing its investment management arrangements\u201d which means he may well lose control of that in due course too.\n\nIt\u2019s basically all over bar the shouting. But there will be an awful lot of shouting.\n\nWoodford came to be treated as a rock star among the investment firmament, the man with the Midas touch. If you'd invested \u00a310,000 with him at the start of his career at fund manager Perpetual it would have been worth \u00a3250,000 by the end.\n\nInitially his new venture produced similarly impressive results until it was derailed by a series of bad investments that had his backers running for the fire escape.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Yes, managing it incurred cost. But it was just a terrible look for a multi millionaire to be imposing charges on less wealthy people who lost a lot of money through staking their faith in him.\n\nSome of his public comments also reeked of hubris.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The Treasury Committee could have a go too. Woodford\u2019s name will remain in the headlines for all the wrong reasons for some time to come. The brokers who backed him may find themselves on a sticky wicket too.\n\nBut before the investigations draw their conclusions, there is one clear takeaway from this affair. It is that people should always remember the warning the Financial Conduct Authority demands is included at the bottom of any financial promotion: Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. Even with a fund manager as distinguished as Woodford once was.\n\nPerhaps it needs to be made bigger?", "description": "From a supernova to a black hole.\u00a0 The Neil Woodford fund scandal reached its inevitable conclusion today with the announcement of his firing as manager of the closed Equity Income fund,\u00a0Woodford Investment Management's flagship, which will now be wound up.\u00a0 Link Fund Solutions, which has been administering the thing, has appointed BlackRock to sell off its assets so that its", "authors": ["James Moore"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/02/10/Neil-Woodford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
