I was not aware of that at all,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, the video itself was just focused on national Bring Your Bible to School Day. It was not promoting any group.\u201d\n\nHe also released a video statement Thursday defending his decision to film the promo, saying he only sought to encourage kids to bring their Bibles to school.\n\n\u201cIt was as simple as that, so I\u2019m not sure why the negativity spread or why people had to rope me into certain negativity,\u201d Mr. Brees said in his video. \u201cI do not support any groups that discriminate or that have their own agendas that are trying to promote inequality. So hopefully that has set the record straight and we can all move on, because that\u2019s not what I stand for.\u201d\n\nDrew Brees when asked about if he knew what Focus on the Family stood for.. pic.twitter.com/5WG6CwEEqO \u2014 Doug Mouton (@DMoutonWWL) September 5, 2019\n\nWe are almost at 2020 When can we stop apologizing for everything? Brees is a good man. These keyboard mobs need a life. https://t.co/aG3fJz7LWr \u2014 Chris (@Digital__Chris) September 6, 2019\n\nAtheist groups, LGBTQ advocates and media outlets condemned Mr. Brees both for partnering with Focus and encouraging students to \u201ctrain children to proselytize in public spaces,\u201d as Out Magazine put it.\n\n\u201cBring Your Bible to School Day is itself a theocratic event meant to encourage public school students who are part of the Christian majority to target minority religious and nonreligious students for conversion,\u201d said the Freedom From Religion Foundation in a Friday statement.\n\nDrew Brees appears in video for gay conversion therapy sickos, doesn\u2019t understand what the big deal is: https://t.co/OsGdYr3wnp pic.twitter.com/VjFdFgzCi6 \u2014 Deadspin (@Deadspin) September 5, 2019\n\nFocus on the Family President Jim Daly said it was \u201cunfortunate that mean-spirited antagonists have attempted to draw attention away from this event by mischaracterizing the beliefs and positions of our organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must treat everyone with love and respect,\u201d Mr. Daly said in a statement. \u201cIn 21st century post-Christian America, the best and only way forward is to not poke ideological opponents in the eye but find ways to acknowledge and respect our differences.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s any silver lining, Mr. Brees said, it\u2019s that the uproar has drawn attention to the annual Bring Your Bible to School Day.\n\n\u201cActually, we\u2019re sitting here talking about national Bring Your Bible to School Day. So that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Oct. 3, for anybody who wants to know.\u201d\n\nHe called it \u201cironic that that type of hate is brought on me, someone that has nothing but support for all people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd isn\u2019t that the message we\u2019re trying to send, is not trying to engage in that type of behavior? Right? So it\u2019s a shame,\u201d Mr. Brees said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
