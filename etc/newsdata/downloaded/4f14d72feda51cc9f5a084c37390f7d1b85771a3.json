Their smooth faces, lightly tanned by the soil of nearby riverbanks, smile benignly at lines of customers.\n\nBusts portraying late Chinese chairman Mao Zedong are dried under the sun outside a studio in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province, China, June 24, 2019. REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nFeng\u2019s workshop is one of the few in Jingdezhen - China\u2019s porcelain capital - that does not specialise in the signature blue-and-white patterned pieces that the city is known for.\n\nInstead, Feng creates leaders.\n\n\u201cI make statues of whoever is in power. I\u2019ve done Mao, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin,\u201d he said.\n\nBusiness has been brisk this year as China prepares to celebrate in October the 70th anniversary of its founding as the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nOutside Feng\u2019s studio, there are few busts of President Xi Jinping - China\u2019s most powerful leader in decades.\n\n(Click reut.rs/2mYqVkS to see a picture package of the busts of Chinese leaders)\n\nXi has removed term limits on the presidency, taken command of the military, and added his ideology to the charter of the Communist Party.\n\nXi features more prominently in headlines in the official People\u2019s Daily newspaper than other top members of the political elite compared with past leaders like Jiang Zemin, said Xiao Qiang, the founder of China Digital Times, a U.S.-based news site covering China.\n\n\u201cBy and large he has an image that no one else can match in Chinese official media,\u201d Xiao said.\n\nStill, the government has actively sought to ban adoring songs and the use of \u201cUncle Xi\u201d in state media. A Jingdezhen shopowner surnamed Jiang who sells commemorative plates featuring Xi says they cannot be found on Taobao.com, China\u2019s biggest e-commerce platform.\n\nThe party has to tread a fine line in promoting its top leader \u201cwithout encouraging the perception of cultishness or allowing excessive commodification of his image,\u201d said David Bandurski, a co-founder of the China Media Project, a research, fellowship and exchange program focusing on Chinese media at Hong Kong University.\n\nChinese leaders banned a cult of personality in the Party\u2019s Constitution after the death of Mao Zedong, who founded the People\u2019s Republic of China. Mao\u2019s power was such that he cultivated a youth army whose violence plunged China into a decade-long turmoil known as the Cultural Revolution.\n\nVeneration for the party and its ideals are, however, fully endorsed.\n\nOne officially sanctioned way of showing patriotism is visiting sites of historical importance in the Party\u2019s Long March in the 1930\u2019s.\n\nChina\u2019s \u201cred tourism\u201d industry has grown rapidly since the government started funding the venture in 2005.\n\nPeople flock from across the country to the city of Yanan, Shaanxi province, mythologised in party history as the birthplace of the revolution, where tourists dress up in historical costumes and watch battle reenactments.\n\nThe city saw 50.59 million tourists in 2017, an increase of 26 percent from the year before, according to China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency.\n\nSlideshow (26 Images)\n\nEven off the red tourism trail, Xi\u2019s images still find their way into the homes and offices.\n\nMost of Feng\u2019s customers order Xi busts as \u201chigh-quality gifts,\u201d he said, often their bosses, many of whom are Party members.\n\nSmaller 50-cm tall busts of Xi sell for 260 yuan ($37.86). A 1.5-metre statue can go for 1,600 yuan.", "description": "Chinese ceramic artist Feng Chengren works alongside the country's top leaders in his shop in eastern China.
