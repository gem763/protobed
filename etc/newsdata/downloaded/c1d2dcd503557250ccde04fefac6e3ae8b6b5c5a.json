Me, you...\"\n\nHarry continues: \"...your brother, your mother, your colleague, or your neighbour. Waiting, wondering, hoping, hurting.\n\n\"We think there's nothing to be done. Nothing we can do about it.\"\n\nMeghan then counters: \"But that's so wrong. There are things we can do. From today, there's a new way to help turn things around. Every Mind Matters will show you simple ways to look after your mental health.\"\n\n(Image: NHS)\n\nKate continues: \"It'll get you started with a free online plan designed to help you deal with stress, boost your mood, improve your sleep and feel more in control.\"\n\nThe platform, which has been endorsed by the Royal College of GPs, will allow users to take a health quiz and offer them a personalised \"mind plan\" with practical tips around managing anxiety, low mood, sleep and stress.\n\nHealth officials hope it will empower people to practically manage their symptoms to stop their mental health escalating, which would in time reduce pressure on clinical services and free up capacity.\n\nThe website also points users to existing apps which can help them keep track of good habits to protect their wellbeing.\n\nIt comes as a new PHE survey of more than 3,000 adults in England found that 83 per cent of respondents had experienced early signs of poor mental health in the last year including feeling anxious, stressed, having low mood or trouble sleeping.\n\n(Image: NHS)\n\n(Image: NHS)\n\nOver a quarter of these waited longer than six months before taking action, with more than half reporting coping mechanisms including smoking, drinking or unhealthy eating and avoiding social situations.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the project harnesses the \"power of modern technology to do good when we know it also can help contribute to some of these problems\".\n\nHe added: \"It draws together the importance of treating our mental health on an equal basis to our physical health, and treating it both as an asset that each individual needs to invest in, supported by the NHS and by the Government, as opposed to just something that just needs to be fixed when it goes wrong.\"\n\nNHS England's national mental health director Claire Murdoch said the campaign \"absolutely signals a sea change in awareness and attitudes to mental health\".\n\n(Image: NHS)\n\nShe said: \"We do need digital social media, wider society, celebrities, industry, to step up to the plate and stop stoking the fires that can drive so much ill health in society, whether that's idealised body image, cosmetic procedures, diet products, gaming and gambling - we are bombarded by it.\n\n\"So I think this is a fantastic example of how those components of society can come together for good to promote better mental health.\"\n\nExtra content will be added to the site over time, including material on how to manage perinatal mental health and advice for parents on how to support their children.\n\nFor those without internet access, paper materials will be placed in places such as libraries, while GPs will be encouraged to direct patients towards the new resource.", "description": "The Dukes and Duchesses of Cambridge and Sussex narrated the mental health advert watched by millions of television viewers tonight", "authors": ["Abigail O'Leary", "Image", "Nhs.Uk", "Nhs"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20527648.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_difference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
