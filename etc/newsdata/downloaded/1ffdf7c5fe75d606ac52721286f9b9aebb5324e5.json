(AP) \u2014 An appeals court has upheld the capital murder conviction and death sentence of a New Orleans man condemned to die for a contract killing in west Alabama.\n\nThe Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals turned away a challenge by death row inmate Sherman Collins on Friday.\n\nThe 43-year-old Collins was convicted in the shooting death of Detrick Bell in Sumter County in 2012. Evidence showed he was hired to kill Bell, who was shot to death at a small-town rap concert.\n\nCollins claimed the judge who sentenced him to die didn't give enough consideration to his rough childhood and lack of a father figure.\n\nThe court turned away that challenge. It also ruled that the death penalty for Collins wasn't out of line with the sentence in similar cases.", "description": "An appeals court has upheld the capital murder conviction and death sentence of a New Orleans man condemned to die for a contract killing in west Alabama.
