We\u2019ve got to level with people,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I\u2019m the only one on this stage who has gotten anything really big done.\u201d\n\nWhen a CNN moderator pressed Biden to clarify which candidates he thought were being vague, he pointed first to his left at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and then to his right, at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), claiming they were both obfuscating about the cost of \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d\n\nWhat happened next was the most direct and contentious exchange among the three candidates \u2015 the septuagenarian trio leading in the public polls \u2015 thus far in the primary. Sanders and Warren both took Biden to task for what they argued were either policy mistakes that hurt ordinary people or exaggerations of his role in the passage of positive reforms.\n\nSanders began by seizing on Biden\u2019s insistence that he alone had shepherded \u201canything really big\u201d into law. He drew a no-holds-barred contrast with Biden\u2019s record on war, trade and bankruptcy reform, aiming to expose him as a false populist.\n\n\u201cJoe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend \u2015 you got the disastrous war in Iraq done,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country, you got trade agreements, like NAFTA, PNTR with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.\u201d\n\nSanders and Biden subsequently had a brief back-and-forth about Medicare for All, with Biden insisting that adopting a single-payer system was not necessary for achieving universal coverage.\n\nThen it was Warren\u2019s turn to answer Biden\u2019s implicit charge that she is vague and impractical. She focused on her brainchild: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.\n\n\u201cFollowing the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, \u2018Don\u2019t even try because you will never get it passed,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd sure enough, the big banks fought us, the Republicans fought us, some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law.\u201d\n\nWarren promised to leverage her knowledge from that fight to use every lever in her power as president, including executive actions, to enact \u201cstructural reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money and repeal the filibuster.\u201d\n\nBiden tried to share in the credit for passing the law that created the CFPB.\n\n\u201cI agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill!\u201d he declared. \u201cI convinced people to vote for it, so let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d\n\nWarren wasn\u2019t having it.\n\n\u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,\u201d she responded, notably omitting Biden\u2019s name.\n\nAmanda Terkel and Molly Redden contributed reporting.", "description": "The two progressive candidates tried to poke holes in the former vice president\u2019s self-styled image as a pragmatist at the Democratic presidential debate.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da68bb82000009b0d505962.jpeg?cache=wnunbo9vsm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
