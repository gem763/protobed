The company unveiled a pair of fully wireless earbuds following the release of its promising, but fairly disappointing tethered earbuds. The new headphones are certainly nice looking, maintaining the same pastel color scheme it offers on its Pixel handsets.\n\nThe headphones are still a long ways out, arriving in spring of next year. Clearly the company wanted to let the world know that it still has a vested interest in the category, even as the likes of Apple, Samsung and Sony have taken most of the air out of the room. The headphones use long range bluetooth wireless, maintaining a connection up to three rooms away in doors and a full football field from its source when outside.\n\nThe on-board mics give the Pixel Buds adaptive sound, adjusting based on the wearer\u2019s environment. The mics also focus in on the speaker during a phone conversation, while helping to remove ambient sound like the wind The battery should get five hours on a charge, with a full 24 hours in the included battery case. The case looks a bit like a streamlined version of the one that comes with Apple\u2019s AirPods, though thankfully not as large as, say, the one that comes with Beats version.\n\nWhen they arrive next year, the new Pixel Buds will run $179 \u2014 not a bad price, particularly if these ones live up to the (admittedly vague) promises made at today\u2019s event. Once again, the company is focused on software here \u2014 not unlike Microsoft\u2019s recently announced Surface earbuds. Though Google\u2019s offerings, including Maps and translate are likely far more useful on a pair of headphones than, say, Office functionality.\n\n[gallery ids=\"1897318,1897316,1897315,1897314,1897313\"]\n\nPerhaps second time is the charm here. And, admittedly, the wireless earbud market is significantly more mature than it was when the original Pixel Buds. That means Google\u2019s got a better framework to work with here \u2014 but it also means that the company\u2019s got a lot of competition, as well, if it wants to be the Android take on AirPods.", "description": "As rumored, Google just dropped a little hint about its next generation Pixel Buds.
