William McRaven, a Navy SEAL who oversaw the raid that took out al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in 2011, gave a bleak assessment of President Donald Trump and alleged the commander in chief was gutting the country of the \u201cnation\u2019s principles.\u201d\n\nIn his fiercest condemnation of the president yet, McRaven recounted in a New York Times opinion column, titled \u201cOur Republic Is Under Attack From the President,\u201d a military ceremony he recently attended at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he reflected upon the thousands of US service members who marched on the parade field before him.\n\n\u201cFor everyone who ever served in uniform, or in the intelligence community, for those diplomats who voice the nation\u2019s principles, for the first responders, for the tellers of truth and the millions of American citizens who were raised believing in American values \u2013 you would have seen your reflection in the faces of those we honored last week,\u201d McRaven wrote.\n\nBut \u201cbeneath the outward sense of hope and duty,\u201d McRaven wrote that \u201cthere was an underlying current of frustration, humiliation, anger and fear.\u201d\n\nRead more: \u2018You have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children\u2019: Navy SEAL who oversaw the Osama bin Laden raid rebukes Trump\n\ncaption President Donald Trump. source Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nMcRaven said that despite the apolitical nature of various military branches, intelligence agencies, and public-service organizations, the people employed by these groups had witnessed \u201cthe assaults on our institutions\u201d under the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThey have seen our leaders stand beside despots and strongmen, preferring their government narrative to our own,\u201d McRaven wrote. \u201cThey have seen us abandon our allies and have heard the shouts of betrayal from the battlefield. As I stood on the parade field at Fort Bragg, one retired four-star general, grabbed my arm, shook me and shouted, \u2018I don\u2019t like the Democrats, but Trump is destroying the Republic!'\u201d\n\n\u201cThose words echoed with me throughout the week,\u201d McRaven added.\n\nMcRaven pointed out what he said were examples of the US neglecting its duty to be the \u201cthe protectors of the less fortunate\u201d \u2013 including Trump\u2019s recent decision to withdraw troops from Syria as Turkish-backed militants wage assaults against the once US-backed Kurdish militia.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision for a withdrawal drew bipartisan condemnation, with many lawmakers alleging the US was abandoning its allies against ISIS. About 11,000 Kurds died during the anti-ISIS campaign, and the abrupt decision for the US to leave the region caught lawmakers and US military officials by surprise.\n\n\u201cIf our promises are meaningless, how will our allies ever trust us? If we can\u2019t have faith in our nation\u2019s principles, why would the men and women of this nation join the military,\u201d McRaven said in his column. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t join, who will protect us? If we are not the champions of the good and the right, then who will follow us? And if no one follows us \u2013 where will the world end up?\u201d\n\nRead more: Navy SEAL officer who oversaw the Bin Laden raid suggests Trump could learn about \u2018integrity\u2019 from Obama and Bush\n\ncaption James Mattis and McRaven in March 2013. source REUTERS/Gary Cameron\n\nMcRaven added that Trump \u201cis wrong\u201d to think empathy is \u201cunimportant\u201d or shows \u201cweakness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are the virtues that have sustained this nation for the past 243 years,\u201d McRaven said. \u201cIf we hope to continue to lead the world and inspire a new generation of young men and women to our cause, then we must embrace these values now more than ever.\u201d\n\nMcRaven previously suggested Trump\u2019s presidency was hindering the country\u2019s values. The retired commander of the US Joint Special Operations Command conveyed a similar sentiment in another opinion column published by The Washington Post in 2018. In the column, McRaven rebuked Trump\u2019s decision to revoke the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan, who had previously criticized the president.\n\n\u201cA good leader sets the example for others to follow,\u201d McRaven said in The Post. \u201cA good leader always puts the welfare of others before himself or herself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour leadership, however, has shown little of these qualities,\u201d McRaven added. \u201cThrough your actions, you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation.\u201d\n\nFollowing the comments, Trump fired back at the retired admiral and characterized him as a \u201cHillary Clinton fan\u201d and an \u201cObama backer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn\u2019t it have been nice,\u201d Trump said to Fox News anchor Christopher Wallace in November.\n\nMcRaven retired from the Navy in 2014 after 36 years of service. He became chancellor of the University of Texas\u2019 school system in 2015. Two years later, McRaven announced he would leave the school, citing health concerns. He is the author of several bestselling leadership books, including \u201cMake Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life \u2026 And Maybe the World.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - The retired Navy SEAL William McRaven said a retired general told him, \"'I don't like the Democrats, but Trump is destroying the Republic!'\".
