Experts believe that any disruption to the Arctic\u2019s delicate cycle of freeze-and-thaw will be felt farther south, though it is still not clear how.\n\nRecent changes in the jet stream \u2013 a current of air that circles and insulates the Arctic like a giant thermos \u2013 have allowed warm, moist winds from low latitudes to move north. At the same time, chilly blasts of Arctic air \u2013 the dreaded polar vortices \u2013 have brought deep freeze conditions to the continental US and Europe.\n\nConcerns about global heating have spread far beyond the scientific community in recent years. The expedition starts on the same day as global climate protests and before a UN climate summit in New York next week.\n\nRex, the expedition head, said the cooperation between scientists from many different countries stood in contrast to the geostrategic jostling that big powers have started engaging in as the Arctic, with its untapped riches, begins to open up to exploration.\n\nHe put the fact that Germany, hitherto a second-league player in the Arctic, was leading the expedition down to the country\u2019s technical and logistical expertise.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing it because we can, and nobody else can do it,\u201d said Rex.", "description": "Hundreds of researchers will spend year on ship improving understanding of sea ice", "authors": ["Associated Press In Berlin", "Kate Aronoff", "Nick Lowles"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deaea458a0c1c893aeed69adc1cc2e43d1d169fd/0_105_3453_2072/master/3453.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=34febd6f142064b3234cb57eb5ecb1ac", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
