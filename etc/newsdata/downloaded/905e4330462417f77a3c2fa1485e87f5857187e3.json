Woodford listed fund agrees borrowing flexibility with Northern Trust (Reuters) - Woodford Capital Patient Trust (L: ), the only listed trust run by under-fire money manager Neil Woodford, said it had agreed greater flexibility around borrowing money with its lender Northern Trust (NASDAQ: ) as its works on selling some assets. The trust has a credit facility for up to 150 million pounds ($184.40 million) with Northern Trust and is allowed under its investment policy to borrow up to 20% of net asset value at the time of borrowing. Veteran money manager Woodford froze his flagship equity income fund on June 3 because it could not meet redemption requests, a move which has prompted outcry from lawmakers and investors, a probe by regulators and share price losses or outflows from his other two funds.\n\nWoodford listed fund agrees borrowing flexibility with Northern Trust", "description": "Woodford listed fund agrees borrowing flexibility with Northern Trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB9M0BY_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
