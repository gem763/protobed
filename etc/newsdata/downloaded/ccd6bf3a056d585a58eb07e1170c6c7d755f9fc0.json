But the gold stripes \u2014 which Rehnquist had added a few years prior under the inspiration of \u201cIolanthe,\u201d a comic opera written in 1882 by Gilbert and Sullivan \u2014 drew attention.\n\nIf and when President Trump is impeached by the House in the coming weeks, and the Senate begins an impeachment trial, current Chief Justice John Roberts will likely seek to attract less attention than his predecessor.\n\n\u201cUnder the Constitution he has to be there for it, but I think at every turn he will look for ways to have as small a footprint as possible,\u201d said Adam White, director of the C. Boyden Gray Center for the Study of the Administrative State at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University.\n\nRoberts did not continue Rehnquist\u2019s legacy of wearing gold stripes when he took the court\u2019s top position in 2005, and as American politics has grown more polarized over the last two decades, Roberts has tried to recede from view rather than become more prominent.\n\n\u201cHe is very, very wary of the courts being seen as being brought into a political process,\u201d White said.\n\nBecause he is required by Article 1, Section 3 of the Constitution to preside over a Senate impeachment trial, Roberts will be a highly visible participant in a high-stakes political showdown that is shaping up to break down on pure partisan lines, much like the 1999 impeachment.\n\n\u201cSupreme Court arguments are not televised. This will make him exposed to the public in a way he\u2019s probably not used to,\u201d said Daniel Epps, a Washington University in St. Louis law professor.\n\n\u201cIt will probably be the highest-profile thing he\u2019s done since his confirmation,\u201d Epps added.\n\nRoberts likely will aim to be less of a participant, however, and more of an umpire, a role he embraced in his confirmation hearings before the Senate. \u201cThe role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules. But it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire,\u201d Roberts said at the time.\n\n\u201cNobody goes to an impeachment to see the presiding chief justice,\u201d Epps said. \u201cSo I think he would really bend over backwards to avoid doing anything that could be perceived as having a partisan motivation.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump and Chief Justice John Roberts.

In 1998, they told a Rehnquist aide in a private meeting before Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial began that they were \u201cnot looking for a heavy hand from the rostrum,\u201d according to \u201cThe Breach: Inside the Impeachment and Trial of William Jefferson Clinton\u201d by Peter Baker.\n\nSenate lawyers told Rehnquist\u2019s aide, according to Baker\u2019s book, that they thought the chief justice should \u201crule only on evidentiary and \u2018incidental\u2019 questions\u201d and avoid weighing in if Democrats sought to get his ruling on a motion to dismiss the articles of impeachment based on standing, or some other consequential motion.\n\nRoberts is likely to follow that model himself. He has been concerned for some time about a loss of public trust in the Supreme Court\u2019s integrity.\n\n\u201cSince 2010, for the first time in U.S. history, all the conservatives have been appointed by Republicans, and all the liberals have been appointed by Democrats,\u201d David Cole pointed out in the New York Review of Books over the summer.\n\nRoberts has increasingly used his rare public appearances to argue against the view that the Supreme Court is a partisan body.\n\nIn October 2018, about 10 days after the brutally contentious confirmation hearings for Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Roberts spoke at the University of Minnesota Law School and talked about \u201chow the judicial branch is \u2014 how it must be \u2014 very different\u201d from the legislative and executive branches of government.", "description": "As American politics has grown more polarized, Roberts has tried to recede from view rather than become more prominent. But many expect President Trump would try to turn impeachment proceedings into a circus. And it may be then that Roberts would be forced to have a stronger hand, if only to maintain", "authors": ["Jon Ward", "Senior Political Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cU.sTGCbgI2YNV1KrsYIMA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/1fabc910-fb2e-11e9-b1cd-699fafdb765c", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
