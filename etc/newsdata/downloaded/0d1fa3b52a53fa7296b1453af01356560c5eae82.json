'Let the House focus on what they're focusing on in the Senate. And I'm going to go out and I'm going to beat him on the merits.'\n\nThis is just the latest shot taken in an escalating war between the two top contenders in the 2020 Presidential Election - fueled further by Trump pressuring Ukraine and China to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nJoe Biden called Donald Trump unhinged Sunday at a Service Employee Summit\n\nAlso on Sunday, Biden suggested that Trump asked foreign governments to 'manufacture lies' about him in order to hurt the former vice president's chances in the presidential election.\n\n'In my experience, asking a foreign government to manufacture lies about your domestic political opponent is not ''done all the time,'' Biden asserted in a tweet Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe rebuke came a full two days after Trump made the initial Twitter post on Friday in which he said he has an 'obligation' to try and put an end to corruption.\n\n'As President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries,' the president posted to his Twitter on Friday. 'It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!'\n\nTrump insists that Biden and his son Hunter were engaged in nefarious business situations in Ukraine and China, which is why he said he asked both governments to look into the Bidens' business dealings there.\n\nBiden insists that he never spoke with his son about his position on that board at Burisma Holdings, a natural gas firm in Ukraine, and insists that the focus should remain on Trump's conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart.\n\n'Have you ever seen - rhetorical question - a president ever so unhinged as this guy is?' the former vice president said of President Trump\n\nA defiant Joe Biden repeated his vow to beat Donald Trump 'like a drum' in the 2020 election in an op-ed published Sunday in the Washington Post.\n\nThe 76-year-old accused his political foe of 'abusing the power of the presidency' by publicly calling upon Ukraine and China to investigate his son Hunter's business dealings in their countries.\n\nHe also claimed that Trump has 'corrupted the agencies of his administration \u2014 including the State Department, the National Security Council staff, the Justice Department and the office of the vice president' in his pursuit to do so.\n\n'He slanders anyone he sees as a threat,' Biden stated.\n\n'That is why is he is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me and my family, no doubt hoping to undermine my candidacy for the presidency.'\n\nTrump tweeted Friday that he has an 'obligation to end corruption' and said his efforts had 'nothing to do with politics'\n\nTrump claimed that foreign governments are often recruited to help with ending corruption, but Biden turned that around and said he was trying to get other governments to make up lies\n\nHowever, the 2020 contender defiantly declared he would not let Trump intimidate him, directly addressing the commander-in-chief and stating: 'Please know that I'm not going anywhere. You won't destroy me, and you won't destroy my family.'\n\nBiden vowed to maintain his focus on the issues affecting American families as he continues his Democratic campaign.\n\nHe claimed that he would keep attention on his goals of 'getting weapons of war off the streets and ending the epidemic of gun violence; building on Obamacare so that every American has access to quality, affordable health care; and taking on the climate emergency imperiling the planet'.\n\nWhile Biden may want to stick to those talking points, it appears others are still interested in probing him about his family's foreign business dealings.", "description": "Joe Biden called Donald Trump unhinged Sunday\u00a0at a Service Employee Summit.
