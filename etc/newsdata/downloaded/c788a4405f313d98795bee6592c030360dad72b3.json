Previously, each trade cost investors $4.95.\n\nCommission fees are charged by a brokerage when you buy or sell a stock, ETF or other type of investment product. Traditionally, they range in price, depending on the company, from anywhere to $1 to $50.\n\nThat started to change a few years ago. Robinhood, an investment app, has offered commission-free stock trades since 2013. More recently, Vanguard, J.P. Morgan, Interactive Brokers and other firms have also announced their own free trade options, as brokerages lower costs to remain competitive.\n\nThat's a win for investors, who are benefiting from lower costs overall. Fees, including trade commissions, can eat into your investment returns, even if they are as low as $5 or $10, making avoiding them whenever possible the smart move.\n\nWhile fewer fees are always a good thing for your investment account, there are a few things to keep in mind if you are thinking about switching to a brokerage offering free or discounted trades.", "description": "Charles Schwab is ending commissions on stock trading \u2014 here's what you need to know about \"free\" online trades.", "authors": ["Alicia Adamczyk"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106158242-1569943320420business-team-investment-working-with-computer-planning-and-analyzing-graph-stock-market-trading-with_t20_krkda4.jpg?v=1569943348"}
