Right now, the president is under siege by Democrats because he had a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. The juicy story is that Trump, like a mob boss, threatened to withhold military aid unless Zelensky opened a probe into possible corruption committed by Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of an energy company. Hunter has zero experience in the energy sector. The allegation, and it\u2019s not far-fetched, is that he was there selling access\u2014all of this occurred under the Obama presidency.\n\nThe Trump White House released the transcripts and debunked the quid pro quo claims, but Democrats decided to launch an impeachment inquiry anyway without reading the whistleblower complaint reportedly from a CIA agent, which started this whole circus.\n\nAnd now we have one from the Internal Revenue Service alleging interference with an audit of the president and vice president\u2019s tax returns (via The Hill):\n\nAn IRS official filed a complaint alleging that he was told that at least one Treasury Department official tried to interfere with an audit of President Trump's or Vice President Pence's tax returns, according to The Washington Post, citing people familiar with the complaint. The whistleblower spoke to the Post and confirmed that he had filed the complaint to Congress's tax-writing committees and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. \u201cI steadfastly refuse to discuss the substance or details of the complaint, but I have some legitimate concerns about reckless statements being made about whistleblowers,\u201d he told the Post. The Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee first mentioned in court documents in August that it had received credible allegations from a federal employee of potentially inappropriate attempts to influence the IRS's mandatory audit program for presidential and vice presidential tax returns. The Post's story provides details that had not been in court documents, including that the complaint was made by a career IRS employee and that it alleges potential interference in the audit program by a political employee at the Treasury Department.\n\nThis is all too good to be true. Sorry, it\u2019s just too good to be true. Democrats have been wanting to view Trump tax returns for years and now that we have impeachment theater engulfing the Hill, some whistleblower comes out of the woodwork to allege interference in an audit at the IRS of the president\u2019s tax returns. This is the cherry on top of the bull crap sundae.\n\nThe Trump-Ukraine phone call impeachment push was an offshoot of the Russian collusion myth, a move polished to say \u2018look, look\u2014he did it\u2019 when (again) it was proven that none of this happened. Also, the \u201cfavor\u201d mentioned in that discussion between Trump and Zelensky is a reference to the Department of Justice\u2019s investigation into the origins of the Russian collusion investigation, which is not inappropriate in the slightest. Second, the Ukraine whistleblower is said to be a registered Democrat, this person contacted Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s (D-CA) staff; Schiff chairs the House Intelligence Committee. And Schiff knew about the contents of the complaint before it was formally filed. That\u2019s collusion.\n\nSlavic peoples and taxes\u2014the two things Democrats lust to weaponize fully to destroy Trump. Sorry, it\u2019s just a bit too convenient for my taste. Not that we should be shocked\u2014but this whole push is a total politically orchestrated hit based on shoddy evidence that\u2019s being quarterbacked by some of the most Trump deranged politicians on the Hill. And a lot of this stuff is being done in secret. It\u2019s a secret impeachment war. Yeah, that sounds like something that will not stain American institutions at all\u2014said by no one.\n\nThe question is will Democrats loop this nonsense in with the Trump-Ukraine circus?", "description": ".10/04/2019 19:44:46PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/266/742c635b-3781-4dbf-9983-d0ff24a2ff1a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
