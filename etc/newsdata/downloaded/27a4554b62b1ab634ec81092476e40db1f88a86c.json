A decision has not been made as to whether the U.S. will go ahead with the levies scheduled for Dec. 15.\n\nThe trade war has taken a toll on the Chinese economy, and things are expected to get worse before they get better.\n\nChina\u2019s gross-domestic-product grew at a 6.2 percent rate in the second quarter, the weakest in 27 years. Third-quarter GDP, which is due out Thursday evening, is expected to have slowed to 6.1 percent, according to economists surveyed by Refinitiv.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the hard economic data that is being impacted by the trade war. There are also long-term implications as companies including manufacturers of electronics, apparel and electrical equipment are uprooting supply chains and fleeing China for neighboring Vietnam, Taiwan and Thailand in droves in order to avoid the tariffs.\n\n\u201cWith more extensive and higher U.S. tariffs activated, we expect stiffer headwind on Chinese exports,\" a team of Hong Kong-based Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts wrote last month. That will likely thwart capital spending on new factories and equipment even further and \"become the catalyst for policy turnaround,\u201d they added.\n\nThe analysts expect tariffs to remain in place until the end of next year, causing China\u2019s GDP to slow to 5.7 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the Chinese economy that is suffering, though. U.S. GDP slowed to a 2 percent growth rate in the second quarter, down from 3.1 percent in the January-through-March period, and the global economy is expected to weaken as the trade war drags on.\n\n\u201c\"With uncertainty about prospects for several of these countries, a projected slowdown in China and the United States, and prominent downside risks, a much more subdued pace of global activity could well materialize,\" the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday. \"To forestall such an outcome, policies should decisively aim at defusing trade tensions.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nGao says the declining trade figures show \u201cthere is no winner in the trade war.\u201d\n\nR.N.
