It was the most exciting \u2013 and disappointing \u2013 part of the whole, long debate.\n\nThe new Democratic platform is far left on every issue, though they try to hide it. For example, the Democrats have insisted they have no intention of taking away our guns. Former Vice President Joe Biden recently promised as much. \u201cThere's no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say 'I'm going to eliminate assault weapons,' because, \u2018you can't do it by executive order any more than Trump can do things when he says he can do it by executive order.\u2019\"\n\nDuring the debate, however, one candidate went off message and accidentally revealed the truth. O\u2019Rourke, who has made gun-control a main platform for his campaign, had previously said he believed gun owners would voluntarily give their weapons to police officers.\n\nHe apparently has never met a gun owner.\n\nBut during the debate, he suddenly changed course. \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he boasted. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nOnce the cat was out of the bag, the other Democratic hopefuls weren\u2019t going to let O\u2019Rourke get all of the liberal accolades.\n\nWhen asked to respond to Biden\u2019s statements about such a gun grab being unconstitutional, Kamala Harris weighed in against the Second Amendment. \u201cJoe, instead of saying, \u2018No we can\u2019t, let\u2019s say, \u2018Yes we can,\u201d she scolded.\n\nThe crowd exploded in cheers, because there\u2019s nothing that gets liberals more excited than an abuse of power.\n\n\"Let's be constitutional,\u201d Biden responded. Then, as if he remembered that he needed to be even more basic, he clarified his statement. \u201cWe've got a Constitution.\"\n\nAfter all of Biden\u2019s strange gaffes, he was finally making sense. But it\u2019s pretty sobering he had to remind the stage of the Constitution\u2019s existence.\n\nOn Twitter, the gun-owning Americans expressed displeasure over O\u2019Rourke\u2019s ridiculous machismo. American civilians have 393 million guns, which is approximately 46 percent of the global total of civilian held firearms. Confiscation is not going to go well for the Feds, and that\u2019s no secret.\n\n\u201cMy AR is ready for you Robert Francis,\u201d Texas state representative Briscoe Cain tweeted, using O\u2019Rourke\u2019s full name.\n\nThe online response to this tweet was worse than the normal political hyperbole. People claimed the Texas politician had made a death threat toward the candidate, tagging Jack Dorsey, the CEO of the social media company in their emotional tweets.\n\nAfter O\u2019Rourke got off the debate state, he responded himself. \u201cThis is a death threat, Representative. Clearly, you shouldn't own an AR-15\u2014and neither should anyone else.\u201d\n\nBut it was not really a death threat, and it wasn\u2019t even close.\n\nHere are two main reasons why:\n\nCain\u2019s statement was basic political speech.\n\nIn Texas, we have something called the \u201ccastle doctrine,\u201d which gives us the ability to defend our homes. If anyone unlawfully enters your home or vehicle, the law is going to assume you had the right to use deadly force against them.\n\nSo, how does anyone believe O\u2019Rourke\u2019s gun grab would be enforced? Now that he\u2019s pushing it beyond a fictional polite acquiescence (which would never happen), what\u2019s the alternative? What do Democrats think will happen if police show up on someone\u2019s doorstep threatening a man\u2019s house and property?\n\nCain was right to point out that gun owners will not comply. This is no surprise.\n\nKen White, a Los Angeles attorney who tweets under the handle @Popehat, pointed this out. \u201cBriscoe\u2019s little gun flounce\u2026 [is] rhetorical political hyperbole on Twitter.\u201d\n\nWhite went on to say that it is not \u201clikely he intended it as other than blustery defiance.\u201d\n\nSure, Twitter is a private company, and it has the right to silence whomever it chooses. However, it is not good for America to silence the robust debate around this issue. Democrats need to deal with the consequences of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s illegal plan now on Twitter, as opposed to \u2013 God forbid \u2013 after some sort of plan is passed and we have to deal with the consequences on front porches across America.\n\nAlso, White pointed out that Cain didn\u2019t really threaten the candidate, because his message was conditional and hypothetical.\n\nIn other words, he explained, Cain \u201cwill use his gun if Beto comes to get it. A reasonable person familiar with the context would not interpret it as a statement of sincere intent to attack Beto with an AR-15.\u201d\n\nWhite attended Harvard Law School, is a former federal prosecutor, a First Amendment lawyer, and no fan of Donald Trump. Still, he found the liberal hysteria to be misguided. \u201cThis is \u201cnot a true threat. Not, in my view, a close call.\u201d\n\nBut what is a little thing like the Constitution against the liberal outrage machine? In fact, hating the Constitution seems like the bare minimum to get into the Democratic Party these days.\n\nBy the end of the night, Cain\u2019s tweet had been banned from Twitter as a violation of service agreement.\n\nWe already knew death threats aren\u2019t allowed on Twitter.\n\nNow we know Twitter also does not allow the free exchange of ideas.", "description": "After Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate, a Texas lawmaker\u2019s response to Beto .09/16/2019 19:12:18PM EST.", "authors": ["Mark", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/248/2f454db8-861c-48ac-bb4a-b1109ed0ae77.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
