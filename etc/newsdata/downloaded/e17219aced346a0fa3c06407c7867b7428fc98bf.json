We\u2019re all sort of trying to power through and find some optimism.\u201d\n\nHarry added: \u201cEveryone has experienced trauma or likely to experience trauma at some point during their lives. We need to try, not eradicate it, but to learn from previous generations so there\u2019s not a perpetual cycle.\u201d", "description": "Harry and Meghan, on day two of their African tour, met kids who escape the difficulties of township life by catching waves in the ocean.", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_576,w_1024,x_0,y_85/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569326991/GettyImages-1170681760_ybbr2k", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
