Welcome to the age of pseudo-profound nonsense", "language": "en", "text": "Inspirational quotes of dubious provenance are just one of the ways in which social media sells a warped vision of \u2018living fully\u2019\n\nYou\u2019ve seen them before, because they are all over Instagram: the captions urging you to embrace your expansion, whatever that means, slow down to savor the moment, and hustle like you\u2019re Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 all at once.\n\n\u201cStart visualizing what you want, then say no to anything that isn\u2019t it,\u201d reads one. Another: \u201cBuy the plane ticket, quit the job, plan the trip, wander into the unknown, open your heart, take the leap.\u201d\n\nThese reminders to \u201clive fully\u201d are omnipresent on social media platforms. We are constantly told how to live well, happily, adventurously or spontaneously. An army of experts are instructing us to wash our faces, to be a badass, and to say yes.\n\nThis #inspiration strategy works because humans are wired to want significance and meaning. But what does \u201cliving fully\u201d really mean in the age of Instagram, when anyone can wear matching yoga pants as they stand, arms outstretched and back to the camera, soaking in whatever scenic background they\u2019ve found that day?\n\nMadi Richardson, 23, explains that if she\u2019d been asked what \u201cliving fully\u201d meant a few years ago, she would have said traveling. Right after high school, Richardson was following a plethora of people her age on Instagram, including some with significant followings. \u201cThe photos I saw of them were on vacations,\u201d she explains. \u201cLiving, I guess, what seemed like everything but worry or negative emotions.\u201d With every scroll, Richardson saw glorious summers packed full with local music festivals and scenic hikes, usually with inspirational quotes peppered in between.\n\nSoon, doubt started to creep in. Were her peers living a better, more exciting life than she was? Although she didn\u2019t post those kinds of photos herself, she says: \u201cThere was jealousy and feelings of guilt because I didn\u2019t go on a vacation every other weekend, or go scuba diving, jump out of a plane, or camp in the wilderness all summer.\u201d\n\nAs a photographer herself, she also had to contend with professional pressure, wondering if the better cameras or bigger cities others showcased were missing pieces to even more success.\n\nRichardson describes such curated lives as a \u201cpecking order of excitement\u201d, explaining that she had other responsibilities, including her own bills and pressure to attend college, that didn\u2019t align with this narrow definition of living fully. \u201cIt took me a while to become at peace with who I am,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I tried to mimic the trends that I realized: this isn\u2019t who I am.\u201d\n\nDr Erin Vogel, a social psychologist who explores the influence technology has on our lives and wellbeing, says: \u201cSocial media seems to define \u2018living fully\u2019 as being adventurous, spontaneous and extroverted. For people who are fulfilled by a quieter life, social media seems to tell them that they\u2019re living life the wrong way.\u201d\n\nShe explains what most social media users know to be true: when using social media, users often compare their lives with others\u2019. In reality, even your most adventurous friend probably has some lackluster experiences or boring evenings spent watching Netflix.\n\nQuote photos are another element of the 'highlight reel' Instagram has come to be regarded as\n\nVogel points to the unfortunate trend of people taking selfies with wild animals and getting injured as an example of how \u201cdoing it for the \u2019gram\u201d can backfire. It can be a positive, she says, if it leads you to push yourself and try new things. Often, it takes you away from the present moment instead. \u201cYou may book an excursion for your next trip thinking \u2018this will be fun\u2019,\u201d Vogel says. \u201cBut in the back of your mind, you might also be thinking about how great the pictures will be.\u201d\n\nThe same goes for quote photos, which are another element of the \u201chighlight reel\u201d Instagram has come to be regarded as.\n\nGordon Pennycook, an assistant professor of behavioural science at the University of Regina, has published research on \u201cpseudo-profound bullshit\u201d, which he defines as things constructed without regard for the truth. He notes that it is \u201cquite possible that ostensibly inspirational quotes could fit into the broader category\u201d. Pennycook says this type of content spreads online because we don\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about it. \u201cThis is why inspirational quotes often don\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he explains. \u201cTypically, it gets spread because it has some sort of intuitive or emotional appeal.\u201d\n\nHe points out that the most significant difference between the spread of inspirational quotes and the spread of fake news is that quotes generally make users feel good, while fake news provokes anger or fear. \u201cIn either case, emotionality overrides rationality,\u201d he says.\n\nBut what happens when an individual does live fully and authentically, and is met with skepticism?\n\nHow can art touch your soul when your soul is busy posing on Instagram?

The first was \u201care you crazy? You don\u2019t know anyone there!\u201d and the second was \u201cYolo! Live your life!\u201d\n\nIt bothered her, she says, to hear so many assume she had not thoroughly considered her new move. All she wanted was a change of scenery and the opportunity to grow after a stifling personal situation.\n\nThat nuance \u2013 that living fully can be quiet; that what looks like a grand adventure could really be a complicated personal reset; that even our most inspired choices may be steeped in anxiety \u2013 goes missing when all we have are visual examples.\n\nBehind the projection of freedom, real life isn\u2019t as neat when you\u2019re actually living fully. It\u2019s often messy or complicated and demands we ask ourselves questions that run deeper than advice to \u201ccreate a life you don\u2019t need a vacation from\u201d.\n\nWhat makes us happy, at its core, is an existential question, according to Sara Kuburic, a psychotherapist and counselor who works with millennials. She believes inspirational tropes are popular because they offer the promise of immediate fulfillment. \u201cI find that people increasingly conceptualize living fully as seizing opportunities, taking risks and exploring the unknown,\u201d she says. \u201cLiving fully, in the Instagram age, is often then reduced to doing things that would be worth documenting.\u201d\n\nBut, Kuburic argues, a full life \u2013 which she defines as one full of meaning, freedom, responsibility, and grounded in an authentic relationship with yourself \u2013 is the same as it was pre-Instagram.\n\n\u201cWe are eager to live our lives fully,\u201d she says. \u201cYet the pressure to prove this to our \u2018friends\u2019 is a major reason why we are not.\u201d", "description": "Inspirational quotes of dubious provenance are just one of the ways in which social media sells a warped vision of \u2018living fully\u2019", "authors": ["Rainesford Stauffer"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1776c95aaa697176e445e162031e037acdf9cfe/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e7a554bac958df09f79310e329212be7", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
