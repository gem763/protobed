League officials say no", "language": "en", "text": "With millions of dollars riding on TV ratings, Major League Baseball denies it \u201cde-juiced\u201d baseballs used during the 2019 playoffs despite complaints that balls are behaving differently this October than they did during a high-powered regular season.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nMultiple playoff teams have noted that hard-hit balls appear to be traveling less distance than they just weeks earlier. St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said last Saturday that the team\u2019s analytics showed a 4.5 feet-difference is average distance traveled for batted balls during the playoffs, while New York Yankees players raised questions after Didi Gregorius crushed a 99-mph fastball that was caught just in front of the right field fence during the team\u2019s 4-1 loss to the Houston Astros in Game 3 of the ALCS.\n\nIn the case of St. Louis and the National League Championship on TBS, the Cardinals were swept in four games by the Washington Nationals. If Cards were denied home runs because of a change in the ball, it not only cost the team but may have cost TBS as well. Post-season revenue is dependent on how many games the NLCS, the ALCS and the World Series air past the minimum of four games. Games five, six, and seven can be a big financial bonus for TBS in the case of the NLCS or Fox in the case of the ALCS and World Series.\n\nQuestion about the balls arose after a Baseball Prospectus analysis by data scientist Rob Arthur found that based on drag coefficient, which affects how baseballs fly through the air, there was a \u201cone-in-a-million chance\u201d that balls used this postseason are the same as those used during the regular season. Despite that allegations, MLB, which co-owns its longtime baseball manufacturer Rawlings, denies any change took place.\n\n\u201cThe baseballs used in Major League Baseball are manufactured in batches,\u201d MLB said in a statement. \u201cBalls that are used in the postseason are pulled from the same batches as balls used in the regular season. Regular season and postseason balls are manufactured with the same materials and under the same processes.\u201d\n\nMLB and Seidler Equity Partners purchased Rawlings in January 2018 for $395 million. At the time, a top MLB official said the deal would allow MLB to \u201cprovide even more input and direction on the production of the official ball of Major League Baseball.\u201d\n\nSeidler Equity Partners did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the situation.\n\nThe apparent evidence of a \u201cde-juiced\u201d baseball surfaced just weeks after MLB officials contended with allegations of the opposite variety. Players slugged a record 6,776 home runs during the regular-season, shattering the previous high mark by 671 home runs.\n\nThe home run surge led Astros ace Justin Verlander to suggest last July that the league was \u201cturning this game into a joke\u201d by altering the manufacturing process of its baseballs to promote offense. MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred acknowledged at the time that baseballs were producing less drag after contact, but denied the difference was due to any action taken by the league.\n\n\u201cBaseball has done nothing, given no direction for an alteration in the baseball,\u201d Manfred said during a press conference prior to the 2019 All-Star Game.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nWith the National League\u2019s Washington Nationals already championship-bound and the Astros and Yankees battling to determine the American League\u2019s representative, the performance of MLB baseballs is set to be a major storyline during the World Series.\n\n\u201cThere was a couple that were hit you kinda scratch your head at, that you think would have left the ballpark maybe during the season,\u201d Yankees relief pitcher Chad Green told the New York Daily News on Tuesday. \u201cBut yeah, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d", "description": "Multiple playoff teams have noted that hard-hit balls appear to be traveling less distance than they just weeks earlier.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/07/0/0/rawlings-baseball-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
