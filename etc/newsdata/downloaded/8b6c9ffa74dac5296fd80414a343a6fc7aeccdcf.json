She told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday that she pulled in roughly $3 million during the third quarter \u2014 double what she brought in during Q2.\n\n\u201cAs long as people are showing up at my events\u2026 as long as they are sending the money... I\u2019m in there,\u201d Williamson said.\n\nCurrently, the colorful California activist is polling at the lower end of the wide field of Democratic hopefuls \u2014 behind California Senator Kamala Harris and tied with businessman Andrew Yang.\n\nYet despite her rising popularity Williamson does not qualify for the next Democratic debates in October, in which the 3 frontrunners \u2014 former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \u2014 will likely fight to separate themselves from the pack.\n\nWilliamson told Yahoo Finance that if she doesn\u2019t win the nomination, she would support any Democratic candidate with 2 or 3 particularly in mind \u2014 though she wouldn\u2019t specify which.\n\nThe candidate said that the American people \u201chave a lot of power in their hands.\u201d She believes that as an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump heats up, the public has reached a point where all citizens must hold a \u201clawless elected official\u201d accountable.\n\n\u201cDo I believe the president has committed impeachable offenses? Absolutely I do,\u201d Williamson said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone too far, we have to do our own constitutional duties, not only people in the legislature but we as citizens,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has to be a point at which we all hold accountable any lawless elected officials, including the President of the United States.\u201d\n\nBacks expanded health care, higher taxes on the wealthy\n\nFILE - In this Aug. 23, 2019, file photo, Democratic presidential candidate author Marianne Williamson speaks at the Democratic National Committee's summer meeting in San Francisco.

Her website states that \u201cpreferably\u201d this would be a \u201cMedicare-for-all type of plan.\u201d\n\nShe told Yahoo Finance that she \u201cintellectually\u201d supports Sanders\u2019 proposal for Medicare-for-all, but that the \u201cpolitical and personal realities\u201d are such that the country would need to start with \u201ca public option in addition to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAnd how would she fund universal healthcare and her other policies? While other Democratic candidates want to tax the rich, Williamson isn\u2019t completely advocating for increased taxes on the wealthy.\n\nWilliamson first would repeal the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which Republicans have overwhelmingly stated has been helpful for the economy. Yet critics have blasted the law as a tax cut for the wealthy.\n\n\u201cTo repeal that tax cut is not putting a higher tax on the rich,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s just stopping this ridiculous slide by which we have made this huge transfer of wealth over the last 40 years into the hands of a very few Americans.\u201d\n\nWilliamson did, however, back a tax cut for the middle class, and ending corporate welfare.\n\n\u201cI would stop the corporate subsidies such as the $26 billion that we gave to oil and gas alone last year,\u201d she continued. \u201cI would also take back this ridiculous way the U.S. government abdicated its right to negotiate with big pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices.\u201d\n\nThe military budget would also take a hit \u2014 Williamson said she would fully fund all military needs but that \u201cthe money on top of that\u201d would go away.\n\n\u201cAnd I also agree about the 3% tax on assets of billionaires and 2% on $50 million or more,\u201d she added.\n\nWilliamson also wants to eliminate student loan debt for all Americans, saying that her vision for creating peace and prosperity is built around the core principle of helping people thrive.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where money comes from,\u201d Williamson explained. \u201cMoney comes from releasing people so they can live their dreams.\u201d\n\nKristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
