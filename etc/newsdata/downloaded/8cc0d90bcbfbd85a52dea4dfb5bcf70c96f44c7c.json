In August 1921, an Aeromarine Airways flying boat circled Lake Michigan while treating 11 passengers to a screening of \u2018Howdy Chicago!\u2019, a short film promoting the city.\n\nIt was a publicity stunt, of course \u2013 in-flight films didn\u2019t become a regular fixture until much later \u2013 but it represented the birth of an aviation perk that now permits passengers to choose from dozens of movies on demand, browse the internet, or even watch live sport. Anyone who has ever survived a long-haul flight by watching 14 episodes of \u2018Curb Your Enthusiasm\u2019 owes a little debt of gratitude to this US trailblazer.", "description": "", "authors": ["Oliver Smith", "Digital Travel Editor", "Justin Francis"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/galleries/travel/picturegalleries/The-history-of-in-flight-entertainment/in-flight-lostworl_2985220a-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
