Nine people are missing and 346 were injured.\n\n\"We'll do everything possible to restore your lives,\" Abe told two elderly women at an evacuation center in Koriyama, Fukushima Prefecture, getting down on his knees to talk to them as they sat on blankets on the floor.\n\nAbe visited Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures, which suffered heavy damage in the storm. Both were also hard hit by a tsunami set off by a March 11, 2011, earthquake, which triggered a meltdown at a nuclear power station in Fukushima.\n\nFukushima has seen the highest number of casualties from the typhoon, with at least 28 dead as of Thursday.\n\nAbe said the government would spend 710 million yen to help with disaster relief.\n\nFinance Minister Taro Aso has said the government had 500 billion yen in reserves for disaster recovery and would consider an extra budget if needed.\n\nWith winter approaching and some parts of Fukushima seeing below-average temperatures, concern is rising about the health of people in evacuation centers, some of whom lost everything in the floods.\n\nThe Ministry of Land and Transportation said on Thursday that levees had broken in more than 100 places, and authorities warned that with heavy rains forecast for the weekend, more flooding could occur.\n\nThe government will postpone the parade celebrating the emperor's Oct 22 enthronement, said Yoshihide Suga, chief cabinet secretary, at a news conference, adding that new dates were still being considered.\n\nOther events connected with the enthronement will proceed as scheduled, he added.\n\n\"We are looking into new dates after considering a number of issues,\" Suga said.
