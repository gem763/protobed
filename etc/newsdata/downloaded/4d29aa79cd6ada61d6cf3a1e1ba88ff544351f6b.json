Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nBetween struggling to keep teen shoppers interested and attracting the ire of Ariana Grande, Forever 21 has had a rough couple of years. So rough, in fact, that The Wall Street Journal is reporting that it will file for bankruptcy as soon as Sunday. A spokesperson for the chain told the Times that it was \u201cinaccurate\u201d that the filing was going to be on Sunday, but didn\u2019t elaborate beyond that.\n\nThe chain, which traffics in $10 crop tops and logo tees (who doesn\u2019t want to wear a shirt that says \u201cThere\u2019s No Way You Woke Up Like That?\u201d), has been in restructuring talks for months. As part of the bankruptcy filing \u2014 if it goes through \u2014 it could close 100 of its 800 stores. Most of its stores are in the U.S. A spokesperson said in a statement, \u201cIt is our intention to continue to operate the vast majority of U.S. stores, as well as a smaller amount of international stores.\u201d\n\nForever 21 has struggled to stay relevant in a rapidly changing retail climate. Its competitors are no longer just mall brands like Zara and H&M, but superfast e-commerce sites like Fashion Nova, which can churn out knockoffs of whatever Kim Kardashian West posts on Instagram in days and doesn\u2019t have to pay storefront rents. Rents that, coincidentally, contributed to Barneys New York\u2019s own Chapter 11. Combine that with falling foot traffic to malls, and it\u2019s clear that although Forever 21 may be fast fashion, it\u2019s not quite fast enough to keep up.", "description": "According to reports, the teen retailer is planning to file for bankruptcy soon, and could close 100 of its 800 stores globally.", "authors": ["Sarah Spellings"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/13/13-forever-21.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
