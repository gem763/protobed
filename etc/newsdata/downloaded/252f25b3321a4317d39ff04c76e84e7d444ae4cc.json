Bitcoin, for example, has seen its price fluctuate violently in recent years as its price is linked to supply and demand.\n\nHowever, Libra is to be backed by a reserve of assets - including linking it to several international currencies - from a number of central banks in order to keep its pricing stable.\n\nThe developers have said that launching it through Facebook apps will also make it immediately accessible to more than two billion people globally - the number who use a Facebook app each month.\n\nHow can users buy Libra?\n\nWhen the Calibra wallet for Libra launches, those wishing to use it will need to sign up for an account using a government-issued ID.\n\nUsers will then be able to convert their money into Libra and add it to their digital wallet. Once in place, the currency can be used to pay for \"everyday transactions, like buying a coffee, buying groceries, or taking public transportation\".\n\nFacebook said initially the new payment system will support peer-to-peer payments between individuals, as well as some other ways to pay for goods and services - for example by scanning a QR code.\n\nThe system will eventually be expanded to include integration into point-of-sale systems in stores, which would allow in-store payments that would work in a similar fashion to paying with a debit or credit card or using contactless.\n\nBecause it will also be built into WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, users will also be able to send and receive money between their friends and families just by sending them a message.\n\nThis will also work with any businesses they interact with on those platforms, Facebook said.\n\nWhen will it be available?\n\nStill being finalised in its development, the full system of Libra and its Calibra digital wallet is expected to launch next year.", "description": "PayPal said in a statement on Friday that it would forgo any further participation in the Libra Association, saying instead it would focus on its own core businesses.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/21/19314962-0-image-a-17_1570221972860.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
