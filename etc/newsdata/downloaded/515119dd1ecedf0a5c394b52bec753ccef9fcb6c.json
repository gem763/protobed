On Saturday, it was about 10% contained.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch the moment a family rushes to evacuate as a wildfire rages nearby\n\nWinds in the region were expected to pick up from 20:00 local time on Saturday (03:00 GMT on Sunday) and gusts were forecast to hit 85mph (137km/h).\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a \"red flag\" warning for areas around the Kincade Fire, which had destroyed some 50 structures.\n\nOn Saturday, PG&E warned about 940,000 homes and businesses could be impacted by the power cut between Saturday evening and midday on Monday.\n\nThe warning from PG&E came as the company faced scrutiny over its possible role in the fires.\n\nIn suburban Los Angeles, the Tick Fire had charred 4,615 acres and was 25% contained, according to county officials. All residents who were told to evacuate have returned home.\n\nNine structures were destroyed but no injuries were reported.\n\n'Seconds to get out'\n\nBBC correspondent Peter Bowes lives in the Santa Clarita area north of Los Angeles, where the Tick Fire has been raging.\n\n\"My partner was in the house and had just seconds to get out, to pick up the dog, throw the dog in the car - gently - just get out. It happened that quickly and all our neighbours did exactly the same thing,\" he said.\n\nHe later tweeted photos of the devastation.\n\nWhat's caused the wildfires?\n\nAccording to a report filed to the California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday, a \"broken jumper\" - which connects power lines to towers - was discovered at 21:20 on Wednesday.\n\nThe fire began at 21:27, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nThe news sent share prices of PG&E tumbling on Friday, as investors feared the company might be held responsible for the Kincade Fire.\n\nThe company is already seeking bankruptcy protection as it faces lawsuits over last year's Camp Fire, which killed 85 people.\n\nThe deadliest wildfire in the state's history was sparked by ageing equipment owned by PG&E. It spawned billions of dollars in liability claims against the company.", "description": "Thousands of residents are ordered to leave as extremely strong winds could spread the fires.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/59BB/production/_109417922_266b0c44-9a5d-4ab3-9662-e2385182d2d6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
