(AP) \u2014 Skylar Thompson and Kansas State dealt a big blow to No. 5 Oklahoma's national title hopes.\n\nThompson threw for 213 yards and ran for four touchdowns, the defense did just enough against Heisman Trophy contender Jalen Hurts and the Sooners' prolific offense, and Kansas State held on through a harrowing fourth quarter for a 48-41 victory Saturday.\n\nIt wasn't certain until Oklahoma (7-1, 4-1 Big 12) tried on onside kick with 1:45 left. The ball caromed downfield and the Sooners recovered, but a review showed one of their players touched it a yard early.\n\nThe overturned call allowed new coach Chris Klieman to run out the clock on the Wildcats' first home win over the Sooners since 1996, and just their third win in Manhattan over a Top 10 team. It was the third consecutive week a Top 10 team lost to an unranked foe.\n\nJames Gilbert ran for 105 yards and a touchdown and Joshua Youngblood also reached the end zone to help the Wildcats (5-2, 2-2) snap the Sooners' nation-leading 22-game road winning streak.\n\nHurts threw for 395 yards and a touchdown and ran for 95 yards and three more scores.\n\nNO. 2 LSU 23, NO. 9 AUBURN 20\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Joe Burrow passed for 321 yards and a touchdown and ran for another score in LSU's victory over Auburn.\n\nLSU (8-0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) is off next week before going to No. 1 Alabama on Nov. 9.\n\nClyde Edwards-Helaire rushed for 136 yards and touchdown for LSU, which wasn't able to put away Auburn (6-2, 3-2) until Derrick Dillon recovered an onside kick with 2:31 left.\n\nWhile LSU's prolific, up-tempo spread offense was able to roll up 508 yards, scoring proved relatively difficult against a defense that thwarted drives into its territory with two fourth-down stops and an interception.\n\nNO. 3 OHIO STATE 38, NO. 13 WISCONSIN 7\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 J.K. Dobbins rushed for 163 yards and two touchdowns, Chase Young was nearly unblockable with four sacks and Ohio State routed Wisconsin in driving rain.\n\nDobbins slashed Wisconsin's top-ranked defense for long gains in the second half, including scoring runs of 9 and 14 yards. He outperformed Badgers Heisman Trophy contender Jonathan Taylor, who could muster only 52 yards rushing against the Buckeyes (8-0, 5-0 Big Ten) after averaging almost 137 per game coming in.\n\nYoung tied a school record for sacks in a game, including two strip sacks that led to fumbles recovered each time by linebacker Pete Werner. Justin Fields was harassed and sacked five times but was masterful at extending plays at critical times for the Buckeyes. He finished 12 for 22 for 167 yards and two touchdowns and ran for a score. Wisconsin is 3-2 in the Big Ten and 6-2 overall.\n\nNO. 6 PENN STATE 28, MICHIGAN STATE 7\n\nEAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Sean Clifford threw four touchdown passes \u2014 three to Pat Freiermuth \u2014 and Penn State had little trouble shutting down Michigan State's anemic offense.\n\nThe Nittany Lions (8-0, 5-0 Big Ten) avenged close losses to Michigan State from each of the past two seasons. The Spartans (4-4, 2-3) wrapped up a dreadful stretch in which they lost to Ohio State, Wisconsin and Penn State by a combined score of 100-17.\n\nPenn State now moves on to a surprising matchup of undefeated teams on Nov. 9 at Minnesota. The Nittany Lions had lost five of their previous six against Michigan State.\n\nClifford's first touchdown pass to Freiermuth, a 16-yarder, opened the scoring in the first quarter, and those same two players gave Penn State a 13-0 lead with a 19-yard strike in the second. KJ Hamler's 27-yard TD catch with 1:20 left in the half \u2014 plus a successful 2-point conversion \u2014 made it 21-0.\n\nTCU 35, NO. 15 TEXAS 27\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 Freshman Max Duggan threw two touchdown passes, including a tiebreaking 44-yarder to Jalen Reagor the first play after one of Sam Ehlinger's career-high four interceptions, and TCU beat Texas.\n\nDuggan finished with a career-best 273 yards passing against the Big 12's worse pass defense and ran for a clinching score late as the Horned Frogs (4-3, 2-2 Big 12) bounced back from consecutive conference road losses. Duggan led TCU with 72 yards rushing.\n\nEhlinger's first three interceptions led to 13 TCU points, and coach Tom Herman gave the Horned Frogs three more when he called timeout just before freshman Griffin Kell missed a 52-yard field goal try on the final play of the first half. Kell drilled the second chance.\n\nThe Longhorns (5-3, 3-2) lost a third straight game in Fort Worth for the first time since the 1940s. It was the fifth win in six tries against Texas for the Horned Frogs, which includes their first four-game winning streak in the series since the 1930s.\n\nNO. 17 MINNESOTA 52, MARYLAND 10\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Rodney Smith ran for 103 yards to become Minnesota's career leader in all-purpose yards, and Seth Green had two touchdown runs.\n\nTanner Morgan was 12-of-21 passing for 138 yards and two touchdowns to help the Gophers (8-0, 5-0 Big Ten) reach 8-0 for the first time since 1941. Minnesota has the nation's fourth-longest winning streak at 10, trailing Clemson, Ohio State and Appalachian State.\n\nThe Gophers were national champions when they started 8-0 in 1941. The 5-0 start in conference play is their first since 1961, the last year they earned a trip to the Rose Bowl.\n\nMaryland (3-5, 1-4) lost for the fifth time in six games.\n\nNO. 20 IOWA 20, NORTHWESTERN 0\n\nEVANSTON, Ill. (AP) \u2014 Nate Stanley passed for 179 yards and a touchdown and Iowa allowed just 202 yards of total offense.\n\nThe Hawkeyes (6-2, 3-2 Big Ten) had their second shutout of the season and fourth in two years. Northwestern's deepest advance into Iowa territory was the 28 late in the third quarter.\n\nNorthwestern (1-6, 0-5) was lost five in a row.\n\nNO. 21 APPALACHIAN STAR 30, SOUTH ALABAMA 0\n\nMOBILE, Ala. (AP) \u2014 Zac Thomas had a successful return to his home state, passing for 132 yards and a touchdown to help Appalachian State run its winning streak to 13.\n\nAppalachian State (7-0, 4-0 Sun Belt) put on an overwhelming defensive performance at rain-soaked Ladd-Pebbles Stadium. When the Mountaineers took a 23-0 lead with 3:45 left in the third quarter, South Alabama had not run a play beyond midfield and had gained only 43 yards and one first down on 32 offensive snaps. The Jaguars (1-7, 0-4) were held to a season-low 139 total yards.\n\nOKLAHOMA STATE 34, NO. 23 IOWA STATE 27\n\nAMES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Freshman Spencer Sanders threw for 249 yards and two touchdowns and Oklahoma State snapped Iowa State's three-game winning streak.\n\nChuba Hubbard had 116 yards rushing for the Cowboys (5-3, 2-3 Big 12). Malcolm Rodriguez gave Oklahoma State a 34-27 lead with 6:47 to go on an interception he returned 26 yards for a touchdown.\n\nIowa State dropped to 3-2 in the Big 12 and 5-3 overall.\n\n____\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
