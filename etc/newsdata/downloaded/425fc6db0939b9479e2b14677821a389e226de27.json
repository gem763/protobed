Those ticket sales easily crushed the benchmark previously set last year by Sony\u2019s superhero tentpole \u201cVenom\u201d with $80 million.\n\nRelated Video: Cops Increase Security at \u2018Joker\u2019 Screenings\n\nMore from Variety\n\nDirected by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix, \u201cJoker\u201d has been the subject of scrutiny in weeks leading up to its release over fears that the disturbing origin story of Batman\u2019s infamous foe could inspire violence. However, those anxieties didn\u2019t deter moviegoers from turning out en masse to see what all the fuss was about.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d has inspired waves of headlines over apprehensions that its depiction of a mentally ill assassin could incite violence, prompting movie theaters across the country to take extra security precautions. New York and Los Angeles police increased their presence around multiplexes, and exhibition owners outlawed costumes and face masks in some venues. The industry started to make some of these moves the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., at a midnight screening of \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d left 12 people dead and 70 injured. Members of families affected by the Aurora shooting had spoken against \u201cJoker.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoker,\u201d co-starring Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy, takes an unconventional approach to the superhero genre. The film follows Arthur Fleck (Phoenix), an aspiring stand-up comedian who descends into madness as his life and career being to spiral. Village Roadshow and Bron Studios co-produced and co-financed the film, which reportedly cost $55 million before taking global marketing and distribution fees into account.\n\nIn a surprise victory, \u201cJoker\u201d took home the top prize at this year\u2019s Venice Film Festival, with critics lauding Phoenix\u2019s borderline unsettling take on Batman\u2019s arch nemesis. Audiences gave the film a B+ CinemaScore this weekend with customers under 35 representing 66% of the audience, with that sector giving \u201cJoker\u201d an A- CinemaScore. Imax showings accounted for $7.5 million at 392 venues.\n\nJeff Goldstein, Warner\u2019s president of domestic distribution, told Variety that the studio emphasized in its marketing that \u201cJoker\u201d is an R-rated drama.\n\n\u201cPeople knew what the movie was and the noise in the background did not slow it down,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a thought-provoking film. We are enormously proud of Todd Phillips and the whole marketing team.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d dominated international moviegoing with $140.5 million from 22,552 screens in 73 markets. Along with the North American results, the worldwide opening weekend totaled $234 million.\n\nAs the lone nationwide release, \u201cJoker\u201d received majority of box office spoils, earning more than the rest of the films in the top 10 combined. Last weekend\u2019s box office champion, Universal\u2019s \u201cAbominable,\u201d slid to second place, collecting $12 million for a domestic haul of $37.8 million.\n\nIn third, Focus Features\u2019 \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d raked in another $8 million, boosting North American ticket sales to a strong $73 million.\n\nSTX\u2019s \u201cHustlers\u201d landed at No. 4 with $6.3 million. After four weeks in theaters, the Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu-led film has generated $91.3 million domestically.\n\nRounding out the top five is Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cIt: Chapter Two,\u201d which scared up $5.4 million during its fifth outing, taking the terrifying sequel past $200 million at the North American box office.\n\nAmong specialty titles, Roadside Attractions and LD Entertainment\u2019s \u201cJudy\u201d brought in $4.4 million when it expanded to 1,458 locations from 461. The Judy Garland biopic, starring Renee Zellweger as the legendary entertainer, has made $8.9 million to date.\n\nMore to come\u2026\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
