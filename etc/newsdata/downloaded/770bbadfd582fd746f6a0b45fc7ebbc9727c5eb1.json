Sometimes you\u2019re the bean juice, and sometimes you\u2019re the single bean floating in it. That\u2019s just the way it is.\n\nThis perfect metaphor for the way we live now comes to us courtesy of Steve Smith, a 41-year-old man living in Bristol, England, who recently opened a tin of Heinz baked beans only to find \u201cthere was only one bean and some bean juice.\u201d According to The Independent, which reported the story, a Heinz can typically contains 465 beans. Where did the other 464 beans go? And how did one bean have the audacity, the rare conviction, to stay put? Someone get Malcolm Gladwell on this ASAP!\n\nSmith told The Independent, \u201cI thought it was funny \u2014 but annoying. It was the last tin we had in the cupboard. I had to have scrambled egg instead.\u201d Tragic.\n\nArmed with his ability to find the humor in everyday disappointment, Smith logged on to Twitter. There he reached out directly to the manufacturer, writing, \u201cHi @HeinzUK. I enjoy \u2018bean juice\u2019 as much as the next person, but when I opened a can this evening I was hoping for more than one bean.\u201d Heinz has yet to respond, but it seems the company\u2019s mentions are full of similar horrors. Like, what the hell??\n\n@HeinzUK my last tin of beans only had sauce.
