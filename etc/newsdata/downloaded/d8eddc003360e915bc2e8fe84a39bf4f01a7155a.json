Beauty Generation has been beaten.\n\nThe superstar of Hong Kong racing suffered his first defeat in more than 18 months as Rise High and Waikuku ran past him to claim the Group Two Oriental Watch Sha Tin Trophy (1,600m) and stop his winning run at 10.\n\nThe result left fans stunned.\n\nBeauty Generation was bulletproof last season \u2013 winning all eight of his races \u2013 and he returned in stunning fashion with a dominant victory first-up over 1,400m, smashing the track record in the process.\n\nHe was expected to continue on his merry way \u2013 he jumped at $1.30 \u2013 despite the handicap conditions forcing him to carry between 14 and 20 pounds more than all of his rivals.\n\nWeight can stop trains, but it wasn\u2019t meant to halt Beauty Generation on Sunday.\n\nEverything started to unravel right from the start.\n\nJockey Zac Purton had to push a little harder than usual to muster speed after the barriers crashed back and was unable to take up his customary front-running role, with Ka Ying Star and Glorious Forever able to cross.\n\nBeauty Generation seemed to resent being behind horses and trapped in the box-seat, getting his head up and over-racing at one stage.\n\nWhat a stunner! Rise High halts Beauty Generation's win streak at 10. #HKracing pic.twitter.com/lD81tp4pTR \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 20, 2019\n\nPurton shouldered clear as they entered the straight and the seven-year-old responded to hit the lead, but the crowd gasped with 200m to go as Rise High and Waikuku loomed up and it became clear the two-time Hong Kong Horse of the Year had nothing else left in the tank.\n\nHis two rivals cruised on by and Beauty Generation did well to hold on for third. The champ was dethroned.\n\nThe Sha Tin Trophy hasn\u2019t been kind to favourites over the journey \u2013 with just three winning since 1990.\n\nBut there are no secrets to this defeat \u2013 the conditions and circumstances of the race ultimately bringing Beauty Generation undone.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a better horse when he\u2019s left to run along. When he\u2019s in the box seat like that \u2026 he just doesn\u2019t show the same turn of foot,\u201d trainer John Moore said.\n\n\u201cIt was just circumstances that really prevented him from really rolling along like he likes to. You could see that he was heavily restrained in behind. He just wasn\u2019t comfortable. So from that point of view, just forgive him for it. Just wait for the set-weights races and see what happens.\u201d\n\nMoore also pointed to the barrier as a contributing factor to the result.\n\n\u201cI would\u2019ve rather drawn a wider gate, then he could come across and been where he wants to,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting the gate two was probably the negative. But he\u2019s pulled up OK.\u201d\n\nRise High floors Beauty Generation in the G2 Oriental Watch Sha Tin Trophy! #HKracing pic.twitter.com/Hv2HQjbhmP \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 20, 2019\n\nDespite going under, there are no concerns about Beauty Generation in the long run \u2013 his remaining races this season all carry far more favourable conditions (they are at set weights) and he is likely to be a red-hot favourite for the Jockey Club Mile as well as December\u2019s Group One Longines Hong Kong Mile.\n\nBeauty Generation remains the best horse in Hong Kong, but Sunday\u2019s result removes that aura of invincibility.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried. It\u2019s one of those things,\u201d Moore said.", "description": "The streak is over.
