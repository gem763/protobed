He waded into potentially controversial territory by suggesting Italy could boost its bilateral trade with the United States if it were unshackled from EU rules that ban such deals.\n\n\"Without the burdens, as unfair as they are, imposed by the European Union, we would actually have a much higher number than $70 billion between Italy and the United States,\" Trump said at a news conference with Mattarella.\n\nTrump also dangled the prospect of some tariff relief for Rome, whose cheese and wine imports were hit hard on the list of goods facing 25% higher duties on Friday.\n\n\"We're talking to the president about that as it pertains to Italy,\" Trump said. \"He thought we were a little bit harsh on Italy and we don't want to be harsh on Italy. We'll never do that. So we'll look at that very strongly.\"\n\nMore than 80 trade groups and businesses, including the American Cheese Society and the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, this week wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer urging technical exemptions for any goods shipped before Oct. 2, the date the tariffs on EU goods were announced. Many of those shipments will arrive after Friday.\n\nUSTR made a similar accommodation for Chinese goods affected by tariffs earlier this year.\n\nTrump said Washington aimed to avoid broader tariffs for now. \"I could solve the problem instantly but it would be too harsh. It would involve tariffs on European products coming into this country and for right now we're going to try to do it without that,\" he said.\n\nU.S. trade ambassador Dennis Shea said on Monday that Washington preferred a negotiated solution to end the dispute over aircraft launch aid, but said the EU needed to permanently end subsidies to Airbus and ensure they were not revived under another name.\n\nThe WTO has found that Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in a pair of cases that have run for 15 years. An adjudication in the Boeing case is expected early in 2020, which will pave the way for EU tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\nThe United States has said it will impose 10% tariffs on Airbus planes and 25% duties on a range of products, including Italian cheese, French wine, Scotch whiskies and other products from across the continent.\n\nMattarella said the EU wanted a negotiated settlement for the issue. \"I do hope that we can come up with a cooperative based approach ... so that we can avoid retaliation between the two parties,\" he said, speaking through an interpreter.\n\nTrump said he did not expect the EU to retaliate since the U.S. tariffs had been cleared by the WTO.\n\n\"In theory, there can't be a retaliation because...this was an award that we got for the unfair treatment given to the United States by the European Union,\" the U.S. president said. \"This was getting us even.\" (Additional reporting by Steve Holland, Makini Brice and David Shephardson; Writing by Andrea Shalal and Susan Heavey Editing Chizu Nomiyama and Alistair Bell)", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said Washington was in talks with \"some new people\" in Europe about trade issues and he hoped the discussions would be successful, as Italy's president urged Trump to avoid counterproductive tariffs.
