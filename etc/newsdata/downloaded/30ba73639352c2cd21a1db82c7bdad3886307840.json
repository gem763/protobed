It also publicly recounts allegations by Max Stier, CEO of the nonpartisan Washington, DC, nonprofit Center for Presidential Transition, who says he saw Kavanaugh push his penis into the hand of a female student at Yale during a separate incident that didn\u2019t involve Ramirez. Stier talked to the FBI about his allegation, but they did not investigate the matter. The New York Times updated its story to point out that the alleged victim did not wish to comment, and that friends say she did not remember the incident.\n\nKavanaugh has categorically denied engaging in any sexually inappropriate behavior, from Ramirez\u2019s allegations to those of Christine Blasey Ford, who said he drunkenly assaulted her in high school. He\u2019s also denied that he drank excessively (to the point of blacking out) in high school and college \u2014 claims that several of his classmates and friends have denied.\n\nDemocrats called for an investigation into Kavanaugh\u2019s \u201ctruthfulness\u201d during the confirmation process, but got nowhere. As new information \u2014 and another allegation \u2014 comes out, there have been renewed calls to reopen investigations into the Supreme Court justice.\n\nKavanaugh\u2019s truthfulness has repeatedly come into question\n\nEven before Saturday\u2019s report, there were a lot of discrepancies in Kavanaugh\u2019s story \u2014 especially when it came to Ramirez\u2019s allegation.\n\nDuring the confirmation process, an NBC report detailed communication between Kavanaugh, his team, and college friends to rebut Deborah Ramirez\u2019s claim that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at Yale, before she had come forward with allegations in an article in the New Yorker.\n\nNBC\u2019s reporting was in direct contradiction to Kavanaugh\u2019s testimony, in which he angrily denied the multiple allegations of sexual misconduct brought against him and said he learned of Ramirez\u2019s claim through the original New Yorker story:\n\nSEN. ORRIN HATCH (R-UT): When did you first hear of Ms. Ramirez\u2019s allegations against you? KAVANAUGH: \u2026 In the New Yorker. HATCH: Did the ranking member [Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)] or any of her colleagues or any of their staffs ask you about Ms. Ramirez\u2019s allegations before they were leaked to the press? KAVANAUGH: No.\n\nHowever, two friends of Kavanaugh\u2019s \u2014 Kerry Berchem and Karen Yarasavage \u2014 were in contact with the Supreme Court nominee and his team, according to text messages obtained by NBC:\n\nIn a series of texts before the publication of the New Yorker story, Yarasavage wrote that she had been in contact with \u201cBrett\u2019s guy,\u201d and also with \u201cBrett,\u201d who wanted her to go on the record to refute Ramirez. According to Berchem, Yarasavage also told her friend that she turned over a copy of the wedding party photo to Kavanaugh, writing in a text: \u201cI had to send it to Brett\u2019s team too.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Republican congressional staff two days after Ramirez went public, Kavanaugh said he had \u201cheard about\u201d Ramirez calling college friends about the alleged incident. It\u2019s not clear if he had heard about that after the allegations went public.\n\nThese text messages detailing Kavanaugh\u2019s knowledge of Ramirez\u2019s allegations aren\u2019t the first time his truthfulness has come into question. Here are five other instances where discrepancies in Kavanaugh\u2019s testimonies have been raised.\n\n1) Kavanaugh\u2019s drinking: The Supreme Court nominee has been adamant that while he enjoys beer and perhaps at time drank \u201ctoo many,\u201d it was never to the point of passing out, blacking out, or even causing slight lapses in memory.\n\nHis characterization of drinking has been denied by multiple friends and past roommates, as Vox\u2019s Emily Stewart explained. He grew \u201cbelligerent and aggressive\u201d as a drunk, according to Chad Ludington, one of Kavanaugh\u2019s former classmates.\n\nLiz Swisher, another former Yale classmate, recounted to CNN of Kavanaugh\u2019s drinking: \u201cThere\u2019s no problem with drinking beer in college. The problem is lying about it.\u201d\n\n2) His yearbook: During the testimony about the sexual allegations, Democrats asked Kavanaugh to define several lines in his yearbook, which appeared to reference sexual activities. As Vox\u2019s Alex Abad-Santos explained, the word \u201cboof,\u201d a slang term that many have defined to mean anal sex, Kavanaugh defined as \u201cflatulence.\u201d\n\nWhile he and other classmates admitted the yearbook was full of exaggerations, those definitions Kavanaugh provided under oath didn\u2019t hold up with classmates at Georgetown Prep, as the New York Times\u2019s David Enrich reported:\n\nBased on extensive interviews by me and @katekelly with Kavanaugh's former Georgetown Prep classmates, what he just said about the meanings of \"boofed\" and \"Devil's Triangle\" is not true. \u2014 David Enrich (@davidenrich) September 27, 2018\n\n3) Kavanaugh\u2019s involvement in the nomination of a controversial anti-Roe v. Wade judge: In 2004, Kavanaugh said he did not \u201cpersonally\u201d handle the nomination of Judge William Pryor, who currently sits on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals (which covers Alabama, Georgia, and Florida) and is somewhat of a liberal bogeyman, famously calling Roe v. Wade and the legal right to abortion \u201dthe worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh, who worked in Bush\u2019s White House counsel office in the early 2000s, distanced himself from Pryor\u2019s nomination in 2004, saying during his own confirmation hearing, \u201cNo, I was not involved in handling his nomination.\u201d But as the Washington Post\u2019s Seung Min Kim first reported, between 2002 and 2003, Kavanaugh is included in several emails referencing the Pryor nomination. In one exchange between Kavanaugh and White House aide Kyle Sampson, Kavanaugh is asked: \u201cHow did the Pryor interview go?\u201d He responded, \u201cCall me.\u201d In another email chain, Kavanaugh is included in a conversation about a conference call to \u201ccoordinate plans and efforts\u201d around Pryor.\n\n4) There\u2019s also the case of the improperly obtained Democratic files, detailing strategies for opposing Bush\u2019s judicial nominees in the 2000s, which a Republican Senate aide circulated with White House staff.\n\nIn 2004, Kavanaugh claimed that he had never seen \u201cany documents that appeared ... to have been drafted or prepared by Democratic staff members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\u201d But as Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews explained, an email between the Republican staffer and Kavanaugh showed him receiving some of the documents.\n\n5) Democrats have also tried to interrogate Kavanaugh\u2019s possible involvement in the Bush administration torture policy. As Vox\u2019s Li Zhou explained, in 2006 Kavanaugh said, \u201cI was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants \u2026 and so I do not have the involvement with that.\u201d However, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) cited two news reports that said Kavanaugh was present at a meeting on whether US enemy combatants should be given lawyers while they are being detained.\n\nThere\u2019s a high legal bar for perjury\n\nDemocrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee called for the FBI to investigate \u201cthe truthfulness of statements made in relation to these allegations\u201d during Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process\n\nThat wasn\u2019t a call for a formal investigation into perjury. For one, the standard for perjury is high. It\u2019s not a question of credibility or even contradictory statements, but rather proving that someone \u201cwillfully lied under oath.\u201d To claim perjury, the prosecutor would also have to prove that the lies had direct relevance to the testimony.\n\nMany of Kavanaugh\u2019s comments were seen as too fuzzy to actually pursue any perjury prosecution. For example, in the case with Pryor\u2019s nomination, Miriam Baer, a law professor with Brooklyn Law School, told Matthews that \u201cthe fact that Kavanaugh apparently was invited to a meeting (and it is unclear from the email how many other people were invited) doesn\u2019t necessarily demonstrate that Kavanaugh\u2019s statement was untrue, much less that he intentionally lied or misled.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to his testimonies about alleged sexual misconduct, Kavanaugh was directly asked about drinking in high school and his behavior in college, which are related to the allegations of assault. If he deliberately misled a senator, that could qualify as perjury.\n\nFor example, Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) asked Kavanaugh directly: \u201cAre Ramirez\u2019s allegations about you true?\u201d\n\nKavanaugh responded, \u201cNone of the witnesses in the room support that. If that had happened, that would have been the talk of campus in our freshman dorm.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times is now reporting that it was. And as a result, some, including Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro, are calling for an investigation into whether the justice did in fact meet the bar for perjury, and whether he should be impeached.", "description": "New allegations are raising questions about whether he met the very high bar for perjury.", "authors": ["Tara Golshan", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wD2wkVq3lfKzFuIJOpBZYzgcIiM=/0x0:5034x2636/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13171685/GettyImages_1042045300.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
