(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)\n\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 Asian stock markets followed Wall Street higher Monday as investors looked ahead to a crowded week of corporate earnings, a possible U.S. interest rate cut and other potentially market-moving events.\n\nBenchmarks in Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong all rose as fears about U.S.-Chinese trade tension and Brexit receded.\n\nMarkets shrugged off soft earnings from U.S. companies including Boeing and Caterpillar. Some 160 more companies are due to announce their earnings this week, including Alphabet, Apple, Facebook, General Electric and Exxon Mobil.\n\nInvestors are looking to the Federal Reserve for another U.S. interest rate cut this week. Central banks in Japan and Canada also are due to announce interest rate decisions.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury is due to report which governments are deemed to manipulate their currencies to boost exports, a designation that can trigger penalties. A watch list issued in May included China, Japan and Germany.\n\nThis will be \"one of the most substantial data and event risk weeks of the year,\" said Jeffrey Halley of Oanda in a report. \"Stock markets and energy will likely be punished should earnings or data from the U.S. or China disappoint.\"\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.8% to 2,976.89 and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 0.3% to 22,867.27.

The Nasdaq climbed 0.7% to 8,243.12.\n\nInvestor attention shifted to corporate earnings as tension eased after Washington and Beijing resumed negotiations.\n\nBoth sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's goods. The 15-month-old conflict has battered factories and farmers on both sides and spurred fears the global economy might tip into recession.\n\nOn Monday, Vice President Mike Pence is due to deliver a speech on U.S.-China relations amid tension over protests in Hong Kong.\n\nInvestors expect the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.25% following signs of U.S. economic weakness.\n\nAlso, markets are watching a monthly Chinese manufacturing indicator due out Friday for signs of whether economic growth is weakening further after slowing to a three-decade low in the quarter ending in September.\n\nOn Sunday, the government reported profits at China's biggest industrial companies declined by a bigger-than-expected 2.1% from a year earlier in the first nine months of 2019. Profit at state-owned companies fell 9.6% while it rose 5.4% at private enterprises.\n\nIn Europe, the other 27 EU governments agreed Friday to grant Britain's request for an extension to its Oct. 31 deadline to leave the trade bloc. But they failed to settle on how long that delay might be.\n\nBritish politicians want to know the length of the delay before deciding whether to hold an early election. The EU, meanwhile, wants to know what Britain plans to do with the extra time.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 10 cents to $56.56 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
