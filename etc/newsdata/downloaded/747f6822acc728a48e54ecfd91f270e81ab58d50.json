Some 23 percent of our adult population\u201452 million people\u2014suffer from some form of it, most commonly osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. There is a promising new natural arthritis supplement that significantly reduces joint pain, swelling, and tenderness\u2014by \u201ctraining\u201d your\n\nTwo kinds of arthritis?\n\nCollagen: a vulnerable building block\n\nimmune system to change its targeting behavior.originates in wear-and-tear damage to joint, the hard, slick lubricating coating on the ends of bones that lets them swivel and turn without friction. Without cartilage\u2019s lubricating effects, to cartilage can lead to bone grinding on bone. Imagine (if you've never experienced it) something as routine as forming a fist, or bending your elbow to touch your nose, or just getting up from a chain, causing serious pain. This wear and tear can occur over many years, or it can be jump-started by a joint injury or infection. In, your immune system mistakenly attacks the lining of the joint capsule, a tough membrane that encloses all the joint parts. This lining, known as the synovial membrane, becomes inflamed and swollen. The disease process can eventually destroy cartilage and the bone within the joint. Once considered distinctly different diseases, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are more similar than we thought. They're both triggered when the immune system attacks joint cartilage that's been exposed by damage to the synovial membrane. The result? Inflammation, damage to tissues, both at the inflamed site\u2014and wherever more cartilage is found in the body\u2014which is everywhere.\n\nWhat are killer T-cells?\n\nBreakthrough\u2014you can train your T-cells.\n\nCartilage is made up of proteins, water, and small molecules that help lubricate and protect joints. The protein collagen is the most prevalent component. Collagen is protected by the smooth cartilage surface\u2014until it is damaged by wear and tear, illness or trauma. Then, the underlying collagen is suddenly naked\u2014and a target for killer T-cells.Our immune system's T-cells protect us 24 x 7 from attack by foreign cells of all sorts. They do this essential work brilliantly\u2014or we\u2019d all be sick or dead all the time. Any unrecognized cell shape or structure becomes a T-cell target. So the newly naked collagen, which was shielded from T-cells for years, until its protective cartilage broke down, is mistaken by T-cells as a foreign substance. Boom\u2014ruthless, ongoing T-cell attacks and resulting inflammation, for as long as collagen is available beneath damaged cartilage, anywhere in the body.Here's the pivot point that changed the way we treat arthritis\u2014offering very real hope for millions. T-cells can be trained to recognize that collagen is a friend, not an enemy. The training tool?. This is a specially engineered collagen. Unlike the altered, denatured collagen used in many valuable procedures like skin grafts, UC-II resembles natural collagen in structure. Where do we find undenatured collagen?

UC-II is naturally derived from, in a formulation that survives the brutal, acid-bathed journey to the lower end of our small intestine. This is where killer T-cells are \u201ctrained\u201d to recognize collagen, and to not attack it.Clinical studies show that UC-II supplementation provides marked relief from. A large study of osteoarthritis patients, average age 59, showed impressive results when testing UC-II against glucosamine chondroitin \u2014a popular OTC formulation proven to help rebuild damaged joints. Participants were given either:After 90 days, one metric showed that pain was reduced by:A different pain metric showed resulted in pain reduced by:These are impressive results. And just as important, the UC-II group's pain scores declined continuously throughout the 90-day study\u2014while the glucosamine/chondroitin group, after initial improvement, showed no further beneficial effects. The UC-II supplements also reduced measures of\n\nSee what I mean about reason to hope?\n\n, such as \"pain while getting up from sitting\" and \"maximum distance walked\". And there was also this significant, telling bit of data\u2014within the first 30 days, nearly all\u201489 percent\u2014of the glucosamine/chondroitin recipients requested \"rescue medication\" with a painkiller, but only 33 percent of UC-II recipients requested painkillers. Adding to the promise of this treatment, a Harvard-Beth Israel study of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis found a reduction in the number of swollen and tender joints in subjects who supplemented with UC-II for 3 months\u2014and no reduction in placebo recipients. Better still, 14 percent of patients receiving UC-II achievedof the disease, a remarkable, promising finding for any form of treatment. A larger trial of patients with rheumatoid arthritis saw similar results. Finally, in a study of patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, a particularly aggressive form of the disease that begins in childhood, 10 patients were given supplementary UC-II for 12 weeks. Eight of them responded\u2014impressive in itself. And the average reduction in numbers of swollen joints and tender joints was 61 percent and 54 percent, respectively. Importantly, no serious side effects or adverse events were reported in this or any other human study.\n\nUC-II can halt damage to collagen\n\nThe glucosamine/chondroitin formulation can rebuild current damage and prevent future damage\n\nReferences\n\nThese are significant findings:The combination looks like a game-changer\u2014a life changer\u2014for millions of arthritis sufferers.
