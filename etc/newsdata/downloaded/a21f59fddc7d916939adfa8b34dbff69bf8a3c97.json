I must not suggest that the whole ERG is male...\n\n'But it did feel like we had a second female PM being forced out by a group of men.'\n\nMs Rudd said the MPs 'clearly felt that if she had been difficult with the EU' they would have secured 'the deal that they wanted'.\n\n'I think it is going to be similar and they will accept it,' she added.\n\nPressed on whether sexism was involved, Ms Rudd said: 'I think absolutely there was a whiff of sexism.'\n\nShe made clear that there also could be an element that Tory MPs had a 'more trusting relationship' with Mr Johnson, who spearheaded the EU referendum campaign.\n\n'But it felt, as a woman who is actively involved in politics, that there was a whiff of sexism,' Ms Rudd said.\n\nResponding to the comments, Mr Baker tweeted: 'As I've said, I will vote for a tolerable deal. And I'm as ready as ever to vote against an intolerable deal.\n\n'It all hinges on analysis of the legal text of a proposed deal and its effect. Eurosceptics tend to be tediously meticulous on this point. Gender is irrelevant.'", "description": "Former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd said she had been 'disappointed' by the way Mrs May had been 'forced out by a group of men'.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19743066-0-image-a-38_1571147064159.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
