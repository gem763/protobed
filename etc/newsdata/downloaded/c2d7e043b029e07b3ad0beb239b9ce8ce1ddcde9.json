Marriage rates have plummeted and the fertility rate is among the lowest in the world.\n\nThe resulting disaffection is a political problem for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who once enjoyed an 84 per cent approval rating buoyed by even higher levels of support among the youth for his vision of an \"equitable society\".\n\nThe reversal of Moon's political fortune was swift. When the newly appointed justice minister Cho Kuk was forced to resign earlier this month over allegations of corruption, Moon's approval rate crashed to 40 per cent.\n\nStudents train in dance at the K-Pop academy Sandfactory. Supplied\n\nAt the same time, the youth-obsessed K-Pop industry has not only strengthened its hold on the country's young but also swept the globe.\n\n\"South Korea is a market in the process of shifting from 'potential' to 'power player'\", said the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the peak body for recording, in the 2019 Global Music Report.\n\nThe most internationally renowned of the K-Pop groups, Bangtan Sonyeondan, or BTS, became the first band since the Beatles to post three No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 charts.\n\nRiding the wave\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe success of the group, and indeed of Hallyu, is all the more remarkable because its work and frames of reference are distinctively Korean. The shows and songs now have a level of reach that far exceeds their natural audience of 77 million Korean speakers worldwide.\n\nAccording to the South Korean government, the broader culture industry -- including film television, and games - brought in $US9.5 billion ($14 billion) to the economy in 2018, an increase of 9.1 per cent from the previous year.\n\nLee Soo Man is among the executives who sit atop the popular culture industry in South Korea. Supplied\n\nThe South Korean government is understandably eager to capitalise on the rise of Korean culture and highlight its own contribution to Hallyu's success.\n\nChanwoo Nam, director of the pop culture division of the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism (MCST), says the state has always played an \"enabling role\" in the development of the culture.\n\nThis may have been most obvious in the 1990s, when an undercapitalised entertainment industry was reliant on government funding.\n\nBut in a \"high risk, high reward\" industry, the government would always have a role supporting smaller enterprises, Nam explains, citing initiatives to fund indie films and Youtube entertainers as examples.\n\nThe Korean Wave has been instrumental to South Korea's economic growth and diplomacy.\n\nOf the $US9.5 billion income that the government chalks up to the culture industry, just over $US5 billion is attributable to the boost in sales of consumer goods, automobiles, and tourism.\n\nNam says growth in the annual exports of key industry sectors like semi-conductors, steel-making and ship-building has been stagnant at 2 per cent, but the culture sector is growing at 6 per cent to 7 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrowth in the demand for Korean culture has also proven remarkably resilient, even in neighbouring Japan with whom South Korea is engaged in a bitter trade dispute.\n\nNam says consumption in Japan has continued \"without hindrance,\" and adds, \"at a basic level, we believe political issues shouldn't interfere with cultural exchange\".\n\nOn foreign policy, Hallyu is seen both as a result and instrument of South Korea's soft power.\n\nJo Jung-rae says, for all its success, South Korea is uncertain about its own future. Supplied\n\nBlurred borders\n\nThe popularity of Korean culture in Southeast Asia, in particular, dovetails with the government's signature New Southern Policy, which aspires to the creation of a \"Korea-ASEAN community\".\n\nBut cultural influence rarely runs in one direction and the success of Hallyu has also changed the shape and content of Korean culture.\n\nThree members of the K-Pop group G(I)-dle were born overseas - in Taiwan, mainland China, and Thailand - but sing and work in Korean. Meanwhile, South Korean actors have long been making appearances on Japanese and Chinese television.\n\nThe internal diversity of Hallyu may prefigure a broader societal shift. South Korea, which has an ageing population, and which is 96 per cent ethnically and linguistically homogenous, has inched towards embracing \"multiculturalism\" as government policy over the past decade.\n\nNam concedes that as \"borders have become blurred, and the world becomes borderless,\" Korean culture will have to find a way to reach global audiences without losing its character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the government's interest in the rise of Hallyu, a handful of large entertainment companies are firmly in the driving seat.\n\nThe most prominent of these is SM Entertainment, which has a market cap of $1 billion and bears the initials of its founder Lee Soo-man.\n\nLee, a former singer who was inspired by the rise of MTV as a graduate student in the US, describes the SM's core product as \"culture technology\". The term refers to a three-part strategy of creating music acts, expanding their reach across national borders, and then exporting the company's model for nurturing talent to overseas sites.\n\nAt the World Knowledge Forum in Seoul, Lee describes the business plan as \"transcend[ing] physical limitations\" and enabling \"unlimited expansion\".\n\nThe next day, Lee flew to the US and announced a partnership with entertainment company Marvel. Shares in his company jumped up 5.5 per cent in one day.\n\nDespite SM Entertainment's genuine innovations, the company's troubles highlight deeper issues with the culture industry.\n\nSM Entertainment has been hit by a series of contractual disputes from former employees who allege the agency's contracts, which can be up to 13 years, were exploitative.\n\nEarlier this month, Sulli, a 25 year-old actress and singer under SM's management, committed suicide in her apartment, reigniting debate on the strain of the industry on artists' mental health.\n\nSouth Korean pop star and actress Sulli was found dead at her home south of Seoul in October. She was 25.\n\nThese scandals partly stem from the fact that the Korean entertainment industry's stars, and the carriers of Hallyu, are so young. The K-Pop industry, which relies on identifying talent when they are in their tweens, hardly disguises this preference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the K-Pop training academy Sandfactory, chief executive Min-seok Kim says he recognises the limits of training and hard work in ensuring the success of aspiring idols.\n\n\"To put it brutally, if you want to be an idol, you don't have to dance or sing well [to audition]. But your appearance has to hold up,\" he says. \"In the past, the companies planned to invest in plastic surgery. Now they choose people who will require less money\".\n\nKim, whose business also provides vocal and dance training for record companies, says trainees receive up to 10 hours of vocal training per week and 10 hours of dance practice per day.\n\nOpting into that lifestyle requires a certain psychology, he explains. \"Children who dream of being idols or celebrities generally want to be loved more, or experience a lack of affection... They have a certain sadness\".\n\nDuring a visit to Seoul otherwise dominated by popular culture, eminent novelist Jo-Jung rae, whose political novels have attracted the ire of successive South Korean governments, cut a distinctive figure.\n\nThe 76 year-old said the young nation's complex and bloody history put its people in a statement of uncertainty: \"Looking to the future, they feel like they have an answer, but not the answer\".\n\nThe same could be said of the Korean Wave, a potent response to some of its country's needs that nonetheless leaves plenty of questions unanswered.\n\nThe writer travelled to South Korea as a guest of the Korean Culture and Information Service.", "description": "South Koreans say it's a hard time to be young in their country, which they satirise in conversation and on social media as \"hell\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9803%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_650%2C$y_80/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/baa4714c69a36d94ea126f249aaabd193b4e641c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
