The government said the hike, which followed a 20-peso increase in January, was driven by rising oil prices and a weakening peso.\n\nInitially, students and others responded by fare-dodging, but underlying social tensions quickly bubbled to the surface.\n\nOn Friday, the headquarters of the ENEL Chile power company and a Banco Chile branch \u2014 both in the center of Santiago \u2014 were set on fire and heavily damaged.\n\nChile has the highest per capita income of Latin America at $20,000, with expected economic growth this year of 2.5 percent and just two percent inflation.\n\nBut there is an undercurrent of frustration with an economic model that has virtually privatized all health care and education, at a time that falling pensions and rising costs of basic services have exacerbated existing social inequality.", "description": "Santiago (AFP) \u2013 Chilean authorities extended a curfew for a second consecutive night Sunday after two people died in a torched supermarket amid a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/211aaf_two-days-violent-unrest-in-santiago-metros-buses-burned-clashes-riot-police-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
