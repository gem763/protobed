She had almost died of cancer once before\n\nLying on the hospital trolley, staring at the ceiling, I tried not to cry as a radiologist took a biopsy of the penny-sized lump in my neck.\n\nIt was November 2018, I was 35 years old, and had almost died of cancer once before. All I could think was that this scan could be my death sentence \u2014 and I had only just begun to live again.\n\nWelcome to \u2018scanxiety\u2019 \u2014 a state of mind that utterly consumes you if, like me, you dread cancer returning.\n\nAs soon as the appointment letter thuds on your doorstep, fear grips you. And while you wait for the scan \u2014 sometimes for up to four months \u2014 you panic over every change or sensation in your body: are these the signs of history repeating itself?\n\nI\u2019d like to avoid scans, but they\u2019re crucial for making sure that if cancer has come back, it\u2019s treated quickly.\n\nI\u2019m far from alone with this experience; research shows more than 80 per cent of cancer survivors struggle with \u2018scanxiety\u2019. In the UK today, 2.5 million people are living with cancer, and with some facing scans as often as every three months, it makes this little-known mental health condition endemic.\n\nI know how vital scans are. I had to wait 15 months to be diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2014, aged 30. Like many young people, I was repeatedly told I didn\u2019t have the disease, all the while the cancer was spreading.\n\nAfter nine GP appointments and countless ultrasounds, I was finally given a CT scan which revealed I had advanced bowel cancer that had spread to my abdominal wall.\n\nHad I received the CT scan sooner, I may not have faced the eight hours of surgery, nor the seven months of chemotherapy that followed.\n\nLast year. I was so terrified my bowel cancer had spread to this growing lump in my neck, I went to my GP, not once, but twice.\n\nWhile she assured me there was no chance my bowel cancer had spread there, my panic didn\u2019t subside, and she referred me for an ultrasound scan which suggested the lump was benign.\n\nBut after my consultant insisted on a second ultrasound and a needle biopsy last November, I was diagnosed with stage 1 thyroid cancer \u2014 a rare type that affects the small gland at the base of the neck that produces hormones.\n\nUnluckiness seemed to blight me \u2014 for this second cancer was totally unrelated to the first.\n\nAs it was caught early, it was easily removed and a scar on my neck is the only visible sign of what I went through.\n\nLaura had to wait 15 months to be diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2014, aged 30. She was repeatedly told she did not have the disease, all the while the cancer was spreading\n\nDr Jane Spurgeon, a GP in Wokingham, Berkshire, says most cancer survivors experience scanxiety. \u2018Even 20 years beyond cancer, patients still quake in the run up to scans,\u2019 she explains. \u2018Sometimes I have to prescribe anti-anxiety drugs to calm them down.\u2019\n\nAs a breast cancer survivor herself, Dr Spurgeon empathises: \u2018After my first annual scan, all the signs were positive; it didn\u2019t look like the cancer was coming back. But my hands were shaking so much I could barely park my car.\u2019\n\nYet those of us in remission often feel guilty complaining about our struggles; we\u2019re aware that we are alive when so many have died.\n\nDr Frances Goodhart, a clinical psychologist and author of the Cancer Survivor\u2019s Companion, says: \u2018The scans take you back to the diagnosis process. You\u2019re back in the same hospital setting, in the same diagnostic machines, awaiting the same results.\n\n\u2018This brings all the horrible past experiences back \u2014 experiences people would really rather put behind them.\u2019\n\nDr Frances Goodhart, a clinical psychologist and author of the Cancer Survivor\u2019s Companion, says: \u2018The scans take you back to the diagnosis process. You\u2019re back in the same hospital setting, in the same diagnostic machines, awaiting the same results' (stock image)\n\nHearing this has helped me feel less ashamed about my fear of undergoing scans. Mission Remission, the non-profit organisation I set up, is focused on sharing practical strategies to help people move forward after cancer.\n\nRhea Crighton, 37, a clinical nurse specialist from Barnstaple, North Devon, is waiting for scans to check the pain in her lower back as a stage 2 cervical cancer survivor (she was diagnosed with the disease three years ago).\n\nThe wait is agonising \u2014 and it will be a further two months for the results \u2014 but she has developed a strategy to help her rationalise it.\n\nRhea writes a pros and cons list on what could cause the pain she\u2019s experiencing. \u2018I soon realised there\u2019s a very slim chance it\u2019s cancer,\u2019 she says.\n\nInspired by Rhea\u2019s practical attitude, I\u2019ve formulated my own scanxiety treatment plan.\n\nRather than waiting to be sent an NHS scan appointment, nowadays, I take control: I call outpatients and arrange a date myself. I also can\u2019t bear the grim two-month wait for the results.\n\n(Unlike in other countries, UK patients can\u2019t check their scan results online even though CT scan data is generally available within 48 hours.)\n\nLast year. I was so terrified my bowel cancer had spread to this growing lump in my neck, I went to my GP, not once, but twice, writes LAURA FULCHER\n\nSo I arrange to speak to my nurse specialist, an expert in my type of cancer, to get the results early. This is something that all survivors should be able to do.\n\nDr Goodhart says: \u2018No one should feel guilty about asking their nurse specialist for help. Waiting more than a few of weeks for scan results is shocking and needs to be altered.\u2019\n\nAnd as I wait for the results, while the most toxic dread twists my stomach, I don\u2019t put my life on hold; I keep distracted and surround myself with friends and family.\n\nI also follow Dr Goodhart\u2019s advice: \u2018Exercise can reduce many of the physical features of anxiety,\u2019 she says. So I\u2019m regularly out hiking and follow the Couch To 5k running app.\n\n\u2018Progressive muscle relaxation techniques also help,\u2019 she adds. \u2018It\u2019s takes practice and involves systematically tensing and relaxing different muscle groups.\u2019\n\nBut how do you manage the biggest fear of all: the paralysing sense of your own mortality?\n\nInstincts dictate you bury this deep within you, but psychotherapy has helped me feel it \u2014 and to feel less overwhelmed.\n\nIn one-to-one sessions with my therapist, we face worst-case scenarios, how I\u2019d deal with them, and crucially, analyse how unlikely these awful scenarios really are.\n\nWe unpick what I really fear: losing control, insecurity for the future, dying alone . . . being forgotten. For too long, I perceived fear as a sign of weakness \u2014 it made me feel vulnerable. But vulnerability holds such power. Facing your feelings gives you the courage to carry on, regardless of the future.\n\nStrangely, I don\u2019t feel brave for surviving cancer \u2014 but I do feel brave for facing this.\n\nPsychotherapy has never been available to me on the NHS. The support it does offer comes with cripplingly long waiting times. Worse, the longer you wait to address issues, the more entrenched they seem to become. I know my scanxiety will never fully go away, but I can cope with it better now.\n\nLast year, I bought myself a camper van. So next time I find myself waiting for a scan or results, you\u2019ll find me deep in a Highland wilderness, with one of my friends, feeling the rush of life.\n\nmission-remission.com\n\nNUTRIENT STEALERS\n\nEveryday things can \u2018rob\u2019 our body of nutrients. This week: Antibiotics steal friendly bacteria\n\nAntibiotics kill friendly bacteria along with the unfriendly bacteria making you ill\n\nFriendly bacteria are essential for healthy immune and digestive systems. But antibiotics kill them along with the unfriendly bacteria making you ill. The solution is to boost your friendly bacteria with probiotics, found in yoghurts.\n\n\u2018If you take antibiotics, take probiotics, too, separated by a few hours, although it doesn\u2019t matter which you take first,\u2019 said nutritional biochemist Rachell Hipkiss. \u2018Live yoghurts are good but not as strong as probiotic pills. Typically, one pill contains the same amount as six pots of yoghurt. Pills are also useful for people with a lactose or dairy intolerance.\n\n\u2018When the course of antibiotics is completed, continue to take probiotics for several weeks. An inefficient digestive system may also mean below optimal nutrient absorption, so taking a good multivitamin may help, too.\u2019\n\nCHANGING TRAITS\n\nHow our bodies have changed over time. This week: our brain is getting smaller\n\nOver the past 20,000 years the brain has shrunk by 10 per cent\n\nOver the past 20,000 years the brain has shrunk by 10 per cent. One theory for this was that as the population grew there was less need to be ever vigilant for threats, so the visual cortex, the area of the brain related to sight, shrank.\n\nHowever, a 2014 study in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology found every part of the brain shrank apart from the frontal lobe.Associated with speech, reading and writing this area has grown \u2014 which may be the result of a freak genetic mutation. However, our smaller brains are unlikely to make us less clever: the intelligence of a species is linked to the size of the brain relative to the size of the body and for humans this is still favourable.\n\nSome experts believe there is no benefit to large brains anyway, as it means longer connections between the brain cells which may slow down brain functions.", "description": "LAURA FULCHER: Lying on the hospital trolley, staring at the ceiling, I tried not to cry as a radiologist took a biopsy of the penny-sized lump in my neck.
