Today, Discovery announced the U.S. launch of its Food Network Kitchen subscription service which will bring daily live and on-demand cooking classes as well as on-demand classes, step-by-step instructional cooking videos, and more to Amazon Echo devices, including the smart screen Echo Show, as well as Fire TV, Fire tablets, and smartphones.\n\nThe service was initially unveiled in September at Amazon\u2019s hardware event in Seattle, as a demonstration of how Alexa devices can be useful in the kitchen.\n\nAt the event, Bobby Flay spoke (via video) about his involvement, saying he was excited to be able to enter \u201cbasically any kitchen in the world, anywhere in the world,\u201d to teach people how to cook.\n\nFlay isn\u2019t the only celeb chef or on-air personality involved with the new service.\n\nThe first month of live cooking classes will also feature Valerie Bertinelli, Anne Burrell, Giada De Laurentiis, Ree Drummond, Amanda Freitag, Katie Lee, Michael Symon, Buddy Valastro, Molly Yeh, Zac Young, Geoffrey Zakarian, and others.\n\nIn addition, the app will provide access to talent including Rachael Ray, Guy Fieri, Martha Stewart, Alton Brown, Ina Garten, Andrew Zimmern, Daniel Boulud, Sunny Anderson, Jonathan Waxman, Nancy Silverton, JJ Johnson, and more.\n\nThe Food Network Kitchen app itself is something of a mashup of live programming, on-demand video and a more traditional recipe app.\n\nThe live class schedules will be posted a week in advance, so you can make plans to tune in. But if you can\u2019t make the daily classes, there are also hundreds of on-demand classes including 500 beginner courses, 395 international cuisine classes, and 75 family-friendly classes.\n\nThere are also hundreds of step-by-step videos as well as a curated selection of Food Network TV shows available.\n\nHelpfully, the new app will integrate home delivery for all the ingredients used in the classes, recipes, and other instructional videos and shows so you can be ready to cook.\n\nBut what\u2019s most interesting is how the live classes will work. The classes aren\u2019t just being live-streamed to devices, like a live TV show. They\u2019ll actually allow for two-way interaction between the users and the chefs, in real-time. This is, by far, one of the more original use cases for the Echo Show, in particular, to date.\n\nOften, using devices while cooking can be difficult because fingers get messy or your screen shuts off.\n\nPlus, today\u2019s recipes sites are overrun with extra stories for SEO purposes and bogged down with ads and other clutter. And while there are plenty of great recipe apps, not as many have integrated with grocery delivery. They generally just provide a \u201cshopping list\u201d in the app, expecting users to go to the store to buy the ingredients.\n\nIn addition to modernizing the cooking experience, Discovery is also tying together Food Network\u2019s TV channel and the Food Network Kitchen app, at times. For example, Rachael Ray\u2019s 30 Minute Meals will return to Food Network with new episodes on November 9, 2019. The app users will be able to view all 10 episodes and tune in to take live classes with Rachael Ray every day during the week of Nov. 11th.\n\nAt other times, the app will offer seasonal series, like Christmas Cookie Challenge, Holiday Baking Championship, and Ultimate Hanukkah Challenge.\n\nThe service will offer a free 90-day trial and promotional pricing of $47.99 per year ($4/mo) at launch. This seems reasonable for anyone who regularly turns to cooking apps and videos, and wants more hands-on instruction. The price includes the hundreds of on-demand classes, 25 weekly classes, plus all the other recipes and shows.\n\nFood Network Kitchen isn\u2019t exclusive to Amazon devices at launch, because it\u2019s also available on smartphones. But Amazon does have the exclusive in being the first \u201csmart-speaker-with-screen\u201d platform to support the app.\n\nAt launch, Food Network Kitchen will be available across Amazon Alexa and Echo Show, Fire Tablets, Fire TV streaming media devices and Fire TV Edition smart TVs, as well as iOS (iPhone and iPad) and Android mobile devices.", "description": "Someone is finally putting the Echo Show to good use.
