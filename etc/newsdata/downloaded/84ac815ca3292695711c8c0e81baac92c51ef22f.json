After scouring many sectors, they settled on an unusual yet appealing market: death.\n\n\u201cWe thought that it was an industry where no one wanted to work, to innovate in, and that\u2019s exactly what interested us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe thought since the industry was being neglected by entrepreneurs, there were likely some good opportunities.\u201d\n\nHe was right. The funeral business is a growth industry; like many other nations, France\u2019s population is ageing, which means the number of deaths is rising. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies in France, more than 770,000 deaths are expected in 2050 \u2013 up from 531,000 in 2000. A 2018 study by a French consulting group showed that funeral revenues grew 25% between 2006 and 2016, and that the funeral market was worth \u20ac2.5bn in 2018.\n\nEight years on, Nory is the CEO of Simplifia, a funeral services start-up with a staff of 22 people. His company provides software to funeral businesses that helps them streamline the process of organising funerals, and also works directly with bereaved families to handle administrative tasks like closing pension or power accounts. Simplifia now has partnerships with more than 700 French funeral businesses.", "description": "As societies age, death will be a growth business.
