Mayor Cantrell visited the man who had to undergo surgery for a leg injury.\n\nA third man is still missing. On Monday, rescue crews continued their search for Anthony Magrette, 49, a stucco foreman at the hotel.\n\nOfficials said the rescue workers and search dogs are gingerly moving through the dangerously unstable building.\n\nAuthorities declined to say if they have any indication whether the missing worker is alive after the collapse.\n\nNew Orleans Fire Chief Tim McConnell said they are treating their work as a rescue mission until they have evidence the missing person is dead.\n\n'Safety is the No. 1 thing. The last thing you want to do when you are trying to rescue somebody is lose someone else,' McConnell said at a news conference Sunday.\n\nMcConnell says engineers are also in the structure looking for ways to stabilize it.\n\nCrews on Sunday were assembling a 220,000-pound crane driven into the city overnight to begin the delicate process of removing the large amount of fallen debris, McConnell said.\n\nNew Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said on Sunday that the body of one of the two dead has been recovered and the coroner's office is working to identify the victim\n\nOfficials said 30 people (construction workers after the collapse) were injured when a large part of the Hard Rock Hotel project collapsed near the city's historic French Quarter\n\nOnly one victim remains in the hospital.

We got it here in less than 24 hours,' McConnell said.\n\nThe project's contractor, Citadel Builders LLC, was flying in engineers from Europe to help crews remove debris without risking the life of the missing person or nearby buildings and aid in the investigation, officials said.\n\nNeither Citadel Builders nor emergency officials have commented on any potential cause of the building collapse.\n\nThe new Hard Rock Hotel was under construction at the corner of Rampart Street and Canal Street, a broad boulevard just outside the French Quarter that is lined with restaurants hotels and retailers.\n\nCanal, which carries six lanes of traffic divided by a wide median where streetcars roll, separates the Quarter from the city's main business district.\n\nOfficials warned massive disruptions in the area will likely last for weeks.\n\nReports said about 100 residents in the mandatory evacuation zone have been displaced from their homes.\n\nAnthony Magrette, 49, is a stucco foreman at the Hard Rock Hotel that collapsed on Saturday as he was working there. He was working overtime at the hotel at the time of the collapse\n\nOn Monday, rescue crews (pictured) continued their search for Magrette through the dangerously unstable building\n\nSome debris from the building fell on the roof of the Saenger Theatre.\n\nCantrell said the exact damage to the theater has not been determined, but productions of 'Wicked' have been canceled through the end of its run next weekend.\n\nShe urged patience because it could take weeks or even months to clean up the area.\n\n'This structure is not stable. We want people to stay away from the area. How we touch it - it just matters,' the mayor said.\n\nThe cause of the collapse is under investigation. Officials said the last inspection of record at the site was September 24.\n\nThe new Hard Rock Hotel was under construction at the corner of Rampart Street and Canal Street, a broad boulevard just outside the French Quarter that is lined with restaurants hotels and retailers\n\nReports said about 100 residents in the mandatory evacuation zone have been displaced from their homes following the incident (pictured).
