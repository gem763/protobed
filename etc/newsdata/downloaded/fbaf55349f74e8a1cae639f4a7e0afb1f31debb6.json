REUTERS/Zohra Bensemra\n\nYAOUNDE (Reuters) - Cameroon\u2019s President Paul Biya announced in a rare public address on Tuesday the organisation of a national dialogue to solve a separatist crisis in the country\u2019s English-speaking regions.\n\nBiya said the talks, lead by the prime minister and starting from the end of this month, would bring together a wide range of people to seek ways to end violence that has plagued the region in recent months.\n\nAn insurgency erupted in late 2017 after the government cracked down on peaceful protests in Cameroon\u2019s Northwest and Southwest English-speaking regions. Protesters were complaining of being marginalised by the French-speaking majority.\n\nSince then, fighting has killed about 1,800 people and displaced over 500,000, according to United Nations estimates.\n\n\u201cThe dialogue will rally all the sons and daughters of our beloved and beautiful country, Cameroon, to reflect on values that are dear to us, namely: peace, security, national unity and progress,\u201d said Biya in a speech on state television.\n\nHe did not specify if representatives for the separatist movements would be invited to participate to the talks.\n\nIn June, NGO Human Rights Watch said the prospects for talks between the government and separatist leaders were very thin.", "description": "Cameroon's President Paul Biya announced in a rare public address on Tuesday the organisation of a national dialogue to solve a separatist crisis in the country's English-speaking regions.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428613378&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0JK-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
