USA TODAY\n\nSTUTTGART, Germany \u2014 Years from now, Jade Carey will be able to tell people she beat Simone Biles.\n\nOK, so it was only in vault qualifying and it was only by .001 points. But when you top the GOAT, you take it any way you can get it.\n\nCarey had the highest vault score in qualifying, getting a combined 15.2 for her two vaults Saturday night at the world gymnastics championships. That earns her a spot in the vault final, which is next Saturday.\n\nBiles, who is the reigning world and Olympic champion on vault, scored a 15.199.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that I was able to do my best vault and qualify to finals,\u201d Carey said.\n\nJade Carey posted the top qualifying score on the vault Saturday. (Photo: Laurence Griffiths, Getty Images)\n\nCarey also posted the third-highest score on floor exercise, but she was knocked out of that event final because of the International Gymnastics Federation\u2019s \u201ctwo-per-country\u201d rule. Only two gymnasts per country make all-around and event finals, regardless of their scores.\n\nCarey and teammate Sunisa Lee both scored 14.2 on floor, .633 behind Simone Biles. But Lee got the edge in the tiebreaker because her execution score was higher.\n\n\u201cIt just goes to show, getting into finals, every tenth matters,\u201d national team coordinator Tom Forster said. \u201cGoing out of bounds, it\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nOPINION: Biles makes two crazy-difficult skills look so easy\n\nOPINION: Biles' legacy can't be measured in titles or medals\n\nWORLDS: Russian gymnast stays cool after hair issue during floor routine\n\nON THE BUBBLE: 44-year-old waits to see if she qualified for Tokyo Olympics\n\nCarey went out of bounds twice during her routine, on her first and third passes.\n\nWhile Carey said she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d to miss the event final, it didn\u2019t detract from the rest of her night. Especially after she had to watch from home last year.\n\nThe FIG has cut team sizes from five to four gymnasts for the Tokyo Olympics, and will use some of those spots to reward gymnasts who specialize in individual events. At the end of the World Cup series next spring, the top gymnasts on each event will qualify their own spot in Tokyo.\n\nCarey decided to try to do that; the United States is so deep that no one besides Biles is assured of making the Tokyo team. While the move is likely to pay off \u2013 she leads both the vault and floor standings right now \u2013 it meant she had to sit out last year\u2019s world championships.\n\nJade Carey, performs on the floor exercise, posted the third-best qualifying score but did not make the event final. (Photo: Matthias Schrader, AP)\n\n\u201cIt was hard for me to not be able to come,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been really excited to be here.\u201d\n\nThis is Carey\u2019s second world championships, having competed in 2017, when she won silver medals on both vault and floor. But there was no team competition at that world championships, and Carey said she\u2019s enjoying the atmosphere of this one much more.\n\nThe U.S. women topped qualifying, finishing more than five points ahead of China.\n\n\u201cThe energy was higher,\u201d Carey said when asked to compare this year\u2019s worlds to 2017. \u201cWe\u2019re all just out there working toward our one goal. It just made it a lot more fun for me.\u201d", "description": "Jade Carey had the highest vault score in qualifying at the world gymnastics championships, topping Simone Biles by the slimmest of margins.", "authors": ["Nancy Armour", "Published P.M.
