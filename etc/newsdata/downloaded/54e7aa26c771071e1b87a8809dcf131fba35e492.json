People in Iowa are still part of America. We have tea, we have internet, we\u2019re all having the same conversations. They\u2019re just happening in different places, in different ways.\n\nGreen: In your book, you seem ambivalent about something I think about a lot\u2014this desire to understand and find empathy for people who theoretically stand across some kind of \u201cdivide\u201d from us, as journalists or as readers. Clearly, you care about understanding people, because you spent two years researching this book, and you\u2019ve stayed in Iowa instead of moving to the liberal cocoon of Brooklyn. On the other hand, you seem really angry\u2014at these people, and at the fact that the national media fetishize nostalgic white cultures. How do you square that ambivalence?\n\nLenz: It\u2019s just like being in a family. I grew up with seven brothers and sisters, and if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s that you can love someone and be deeply angry at them at the same time. This is a key tension in America: You can love this place and still be pissed at it.\n\nThis is a very personal thing for me. I was married to somebody who voted and pushed for policies that I believed were hurting America. The people in my churches, who have loved me through some really difficult times, were also the people I heard saying very homophobic things and hurting others. I love this place where I live, but I also want it to be better.\n\nGreen: What you just articulated seems to be the opposite of so-called cancel culture. There\u2019s a spirit right now, on both the right and the left, of total elimination of the enemy. Do you see yourself as countering that culture, or homeless in a world that\u2019s driven by those impulses?\n\nLenz: I think I might disagree with the characterization.\n\nGreen: Hit back, Lyz!\n\nLenz: [Laughs] I think that game of both-siderism is really dangerous, and here\u2019s why: The conversation should be about who has power and who is not being given a voice.\n\nI was recently talking with my pastor about this idea that we all just need to \u201ccome together and talk.\u201d And I was saying, \u201cSome people need to be quiet. Some people need to listen.\u201d Right now, the people who have power are really afraid of losing it. And they\u2019re the ones crying victim when other people get a voice at the table.\n\nGreen: I hear what you\u2019re saying, but you\u2019re also speaking from a left perspective, and if we\u2019re going to look at that world, I will say: I hear a lot of, \u201cFuck Trump, and fuck everyone who voted for him.\u201d\n\nLenz: I understand the feeling\u2014I think this president is horrible and toxic. But what you\u2019re saying is correct: A lot of people in America did vote for him, and you cannot just say, \u201cWell, they don\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d What you can do, however, is look a person in the eye and say, \u201cWhat you\u2019re advocating hurts people, and is morally reprehensible.\u201d", "description": "A candid conversation with the Iowa-based writer and thinker Lyz Lenz, who believes that meeting your neighbor is the only solution", "authors": ["Emma Green"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/RTS1WZRJ/facebook.jpg?1567283656"}
