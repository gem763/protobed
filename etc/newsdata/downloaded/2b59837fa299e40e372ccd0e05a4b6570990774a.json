REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo\n\nBut in an interview with Reuters, Ben van Beurden expressed concern that some shareholders could abandon the world\u2019s second-largest listed energy company due partly to what he called the \u201cdemonisation\u201d of oil and gas and \u201cunjustified\u201d worries that its business model was unsustainable.\n\nThe 61-year-old Dutch executive in recent years became one of the sector\u2019s most prominent voices advocating action over global warming in the wake of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.\n\nShell, which supplies around 3% of the world\u2019s energy, set out in 2017 a plan to halve the intensity of its greenhouse emissions by the middle of the century, based in large part on building one of the world\u2019s biggest power businesses.\n\nStill, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from Shell\u2019s operations and the products it sells rose by 2.5% between 2017 and 2018.\n\nA defiant van Beurden rejected a rising chorus from climate activists and parts of the investor community to transform radically the 112-year-old Anglo-Dutch company\u2019s traditional business model.\n\n\u201cDespite what a lot of activists say, it is entirely legitimate to invest in oil and gas because the world demands it,\u201d van Beurden said.\n\n\u201cWe have no choice\u201d but to invest in long-life projects, he added.\n\nShell and its peers have long insisted that switching away from oil and gas to cleaner sources of energy will take decades as demand for transport and plastics continues to grow. Investors have warned, however, that oil companies often rely on forecasts that underestimate the pace of change.\n\nShell plans to greenlight more than 35 new oil and gas projects by 2025, according to an investor presentation from June.\n\nOil and gas remain the backbone of profits for Shell, the largest listed company on London's main FTSE index .FTSE.\n\nWhile oil and gas account for the entirety of Shell\u2019s free cashflow today, it foresees a gradual diversification over the next two decades. Oil and gas are each still expected to provide a third of free cashflow, however, with the rest coming from power and chemicals.\n\nMany oil and gas projects such as gas-processing plants, deepwater platforms or chemical plants take billions of dollars to develop and operate for decades.\n\n\u201cRED HERRING\u201d\n\nShell, like many rivals, has become more selective in its investments as the outlook for oil prices and demand remains unclear. It targets new projects that can be profitable at oil prices of $20 to $30 a barrel and which emit relatively low greenhouse emissions. Oil is trading at around $60 a barrel.\n\n\u201cWe can sustain an upstream portfolio all the way into the 2030s if there is an economic rationale for doing that and a societal rationale for doing that,\u201d van Beurden said.\n\n\u201cFortunately enough, we have more of those than we have money to spend on them.\u201d\n\nVan Beurden rejected as a \u201cred herring\u201d arguments that Shell\u2019s oil and gas reserves, which can sustain its current production for around eight years, would be economically unviable, or stranded, in the future.\n\nA lack of investment in oil and gas projects could lead to a supply shortage and result in price spikes, he said.\n\n\u201cOne of the bigger risks is not so much that we will become dinosaurs because we are still investing in oil and gas when there is no need for it anymore. A bigger risk is prematurely turning your back on oil and gas.\u201d\n\nShell plans to increase its annual spending to around $32 billion by 2025 from the current $25 billion, with up to one tenth allocated to renewables and the power business.\n\nThe company, the world\u2019s largest dividend payer, plans to return $125 billion to shareholders in the five years to 2025.\n\nOn liquefied natural gas, of which Shell is the world\u2019s biggest trader, van Beurden said the market would exhibit oversupply in the near term. \u201cBut (LNG) demand will continue to grow at a pace that is roughly four times that of oil,\u201d he said.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Shell reserves - tmsnrt.rs/35x0xAy)\n\n(GRAPHIC: Shell capex - tmsnrt.rs/35zFjSE)\n\n(GRAPHIC: Shell's share performance - tmsnrt.rs/2LsEuoy)\n\nShell has become a focal point of environmental protests, particularly in Europe, with regular demonstrations outside its London headquarters and the British National Theatre dropping Shell\u2019s sponsorship in recent months.\n\nAt the same time, investors have sharply increased their scrutiny of companies\u2019 environmental performance.\n\nAmid growing uncertainty over future demand, the share prices of Shell and its peers have underperformed relative to other sectors.\n\nVan Beurden expressed concern that some investors could ditch Shell, acknowledging that shares in the company were trading at a discount partly due to \u201csocietal risk\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am afraid of that, to be honest,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think they will flee for the justified concern of stranded assets ... (It is) the continued pressure on our sector, in some cases to the point of demonisation, that scares asset managers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not at a scale that the alarm bells are ringing, but it is an unhealthy trend.\u201d\n\nVan Beurden put the onus for achieving a transformation to low-carbon economies on governments, warning that not enough progress had been made to reach the Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century.\n\n\u201cCan that happen? I think it can ... Increasingly society is not putting up with the fact we are not making enough progress.\u201d\n\nDelaying implementation of the right climate policies could result in \u201cknee-jerk\u201d political responses that might be very disruptive to society, he said.\n\n\u201cLet the air out of the balloon as soon as you can before the balloon actually bursts,\u201d van Beurden said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, speaks during a news conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, February 15, 2016.
