(AP) - John Calipari appreciates discussing the players who returned to Kentucky instead of focusing on who left.\n\nThat\u2019s understandable considering the second-ranked Wildcats have experience in the backcourt and inside, which helps offset their annual roster changeover.\n\nFour regulars, including starting point guard Ashton Hagans, return from a 30-7 team (15-3 Southeastern Conference) that lost in overtime to SEC rival Auburn in the Elite Eight. Despite the change of pace for Calipari\u2019s program to be discussing veterans, the coach warns that putting things together might take more work this season.\n\nBut Calipari is optimistic about the Wildcats\u2019 long-term prospects of pursuing a ninth national championship.\n\n\u201cSome of the best teams I\u2019ve coached weren\u2019t full rosters,\u201d the 11th-year coach said earlier this month.\n\n\u201cPart of it is going to be in the games (where) we\u2019ve got to get them to understand we\u2019re going to have to take it up a notch. The main thing for me will be how do we rebound and how tough are we physically?\u201d\n\nHaving Hagans and Immanuel Quickley in the backcourt and Nick Richards and EJ Montgomery in the middle will help answer some of those questions.\n\nHagans\u2018 return after averaging 7.8 points and 4.3 assists per game last season is significant. He announced he would be back for a second season before teammates PJ Washington, Tyler Herro and Keldon Johnson became first-round NBA draft picks. Hagans hopes to build on a rookie year that established him as one of the nation\u2019s top on-ball defenders.\n\nCalipari has recruited backcourt help in freshmen Tyrese Maxey, Johnny Juzang and Dontaie Allen, who\u2019s recovering from knee and shoulder injuries. Hagans is prepared to lead Kentucky wherever he\u2019s needed and is encouraged by what he has around him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to just show (Calipari) that you\u2019re ready, that you\u2019re out here fighting and going to compete against everybody,\u201d said Hagans, the SEC\u2019s co-defensive Player of the year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got four guys back that have a leadership role on this team, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to need to be at our best.\u201d\n\nSome other things to look for during the Kentucky\u2019s 2019-20 season:\n\nSHORT ON SIZE\n\nThe return of Richards, a 6-11 junior, and 6-10 Montgomery provide post experience, but Kentucky\u2019s height drops off drastically with 6-9 grad transfer Nick Sestina the next tallest player. Richards and Montgomery appear ready for more minutes but they\u2019ll be challenged to avoid foul trouble.\n\nThe frontcourt newcomers include 6-7 Keion Brooks and 6-6 Kahlil Whitney. Calipari said smaller lineups could frequently result to give his post men a break and mitigate foul issues. The Wildcats\u2019 upside is length throughout the roster, which could help with rebounding and spreading opponents out defensively.\n\nVETERAN NEWCOMER\n\nFormer Bucknell forward Nate Sestina is Kentucky\u2019s latest grad transfer with expectations of providing leadership like predecessor Reid Travis. Sestina averaged 15.8 points and 8.5 rebounds last season to earn second team All-Patriot League honors. He has drawn attention for dropping weight and becoming one of Kentucky\u2019s more chiseled players.\n\n\u201cI feel the best I\u2019ve ever felt, and I\u2019ve played basketball for four years,\u201d he said.\n\nFINDING OFFENSE\n\nThe Wildcats return just 27% of their scoring from last season, led by Hagans and Quickley (5.2 points per game). Tyrese Maxey and Johnny Juzang are projected as the likely shooters, though Hagans and Quickley seem primed to take more shots this season. Sestina has shown long range potential.\n\nSERVING NOTICE\n\nQuickley\u2019s offseason improvement has drawn praise from Calipari. The sophomore not only looks more muscular than last season, but is showing aggression. Quickley will likely play off the ball but handles the ball well enough to be able to spell Hagans at the point. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on my body,\u201d he said, \u201cchanging a lot of parts of my game, just working to be the all-around best player I can be. My mindset has changed.\u201d\n\nTHE SCHEDULE\n\nKentucky again opens the season with a big test on Nov. 5 against top-ranked Michigan State at the Champions Classic in New York. December features a steady docket of Power Five opponents including consecutive matchups against Utah and Ohio State in Las Vegas and a home showdown against rival and No. 5 Louisville before beginning SEC play against Missouri. The Wildcats visit national runner-up Texas Tech in the Big 12/SEC Challenge on Jan. 25.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "John Calipari appreciates discussing the players who returned to Kentucky instead of focusing on who left.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gary B.
