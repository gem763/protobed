Superior Court judge will move forward with the proceedings or declare a mistrial based on the defendant\u2019s competency, the judge said Friday.\n\nJudge Danya Dayson ordered a psychiatric report done on defendant Lorenzo Graham after he questioned his accuser while she was on the witness stand, asking un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox questions including whether she found him to be handsome and whether she was familiar with the movie \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Don\u2019t you think the defendant is handsome?\u2019: Rape case takes unusual turn when accused represents himself at trial]\n\nDayson ordered the study done Thursday. A District psychologist who briefly examined Graham said he was not competent to continue with the trial, Dayson said at a hearing Friday. But Dayson wants to query the psychologist, Teresa Grant, in person to determine whether she believes that Graham is not competent to move forward with trial at all, not competent to represent himself at trial or both.\n\nDayson ordered a similar psychological report done on Graham in June. At that point, doctors at St. Elizabeths, the District\u2019s psychiatric hospital, determined that Graham was competent to both move forward with his trial and to represent himself.\n\nBut Dayson said she is now concerned that his competency has deteriorated. \u201cCompetency is a fluid concept,\u201d Dayson said. \u201cOne can be competent one day and not competent the next.\u201d\n\nAt the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Kenya Davis argued that the trial should continue.\n\nGraham also argued that he wanted to move forward. But Graham\u2019s court-appointed attorney adviser, Howard McEachern, who initiated the follow-up competency evaluation Thursday, argued that the trial should be halted.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The judge questioned the competency of the defendant, who is representing himself at trial.", "authors": ["Keith L.
