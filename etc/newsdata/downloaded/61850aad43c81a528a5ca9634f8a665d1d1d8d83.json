Ralph Abraham (R) to claim his spot on the ballot, winning just over 27 percent of the vote with nearly all the votes counted. The outcome was good news for Trump and national Republicans, who had feared just a weeks ago that Edwards could win the election outright.\n\nAD\n\nTrump did not endorse any of the Republican candidates, but the president traveled to Louisiana on Friday night to urge Republicans to vote for either Abraham or Rispone in the race. Trump also fired off more than a half-dozen tweets over the past week attacking Edwards, who is only Democratic governor in the Deep South.\n\nOn Saturday night, Trump fired the first shots of the runoff election.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, has done a poor job. NOW HE IS IN A RUNOFF WITH A GREAT REPUBLICAN, @EddieRispone. Thank you,\u201d Trump tweeted, asserting that Edwards had fallen sharply \u201cafter I explained what a bad job the Governor was doing.\u201d\n\nEdwards, who is pro-gun and opposes abortion, has been relatively popular throughout his term as he\u2019s worked to balance the budget. But Republicans believe he\u2019s vulnerable in the runoff as white voters continue to flee the Democratic Party in Louisiana, a state Trump won by nearly 20 points in 2016.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the final days of the campaign, Rispone argued he was the \u201coutsider\u201d in the race as he overwhelmed Abraham with television ads. Although much of the GOP establishment in the state was backing Abraham, Rispone won over the state\u2019s grass-roots conservative movement, including securing an endorsement from \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d star Willie Robertson.\n\nAD\n\nEdwards, a prolific fundraiser, is expected to attack Rispone as being too partisan and divisive for the state.\n\nThe so-called \u201cjungle\u201d primary included six candidates, but Edwards was always considered the front-runner, while Abraham and Rispone were the leading GOP challengers.\n\nEdwards, 53, was elected governor in 2015 after he easily defeated Republican David Vitter, who at the time was a U.S. senator marred in scandal. Edwards campaigned this year on a record of bipartisan work with the Republican-controlled legislature to balance the budget, expand Medicaid and reduce the prison population.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMedicaid expansion is still the easiest big decision I\u2019ve ever made as governor,\u201d Edwards said during the final debate of the campaign, noting he was able to extend health insurance to nearly half a million people.\n\nAD\n\nBut Edwards, a devout Catholic, had a rocky relationship with abortion rights supporters. In June, Edwards outraged activists and Democratic leaders when he signed a bill that outlawed abortion when a \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d was detected. The legislation, which advocates said could outlaw abortion as early as the sixth week of a pregnancy, did not include an exception for rape or incest.\n\nIn the fight for GOP voters between Abraham and Rispone, both sought to link themselves to Trump as they campaigned as staunch conservatives.\n\nAbraham, a practicing physician and two-term congressman who represents the northeastern part of the state, had the support of many party leaders. In Congress, Abraham, 65, was a reliable vote for GOP leadership but generally maintained a low-key presence on Capitol Hill.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRispone, owner of a large contracting business in Baton Rouge, tried to position himself as the outsider in the race. He spent more than $10 million of his own money to flood airwaves with ads highlighting his Christian faith, his opposition to abortion and support for Trump\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump ran on cleaning up the swamp in Washington,\u201d Rispone, 70, said in a campaign ad. \u201cOf course, we have that in Louisiana today. We have people who make a living off government.\u201d\n\nAt times, though, Rispone struggled to answer questions about some of Trump\u2019s controversial actions. During the debate, a moderator pressed Rispone about how he can campaign on moral values while staying quiet about Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t judge other people,\u201d Rispone finally said. \u201cI just don\u2019t do that. It\u2019s not up to me to judge someone else\u2019s moral character.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome Republicans also criticized the tone of Rispone\u2019s campaign, including an ad that accused Abraham of voting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D) hundreds of times. Abraham noted it\u2019s common for some congressional votes, such as \u201cnaming of a post office,\u201d to be bipartisan and nearly unanimous.\n\nBut Abraham and Rispone spent much of the campaign teaming up to attack Edwards\u2019s record.\n\nAlthough neither Abraham nor Rispone vowed to reverse the expansion of Medicaid, they accused the governor of mismanaging its rollout. They also vowed to fully rescind the 1 percent sales tax increase that Edwards fought for to help balance the budget.\n\nAD\n\nTrump began taking a heightened interest in the contest about a month ago as polls showed that Edwards could win the primary outright.\n\nRepublicans are hoping to rebound after losing seven governorships in the 2018 midterm election, including in Wisconsin and Michigan, two states that are expected to be critical to the president\u2019s reelection hopes.\n\nAD\n\nMississippi and Kentucky are also holding gubernatorial elections this year. Trump easily won all three states in 2016, but Democrats believe they have a shot at winning the gubernatorial races.\n\nIn Kentucky, Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear is locked in a close contest against incumbent Matt Bevin (R) in the Nov. 5 general election. Bevin is deeply unpopular and has also been trying to link himself to Trump, who is expected to campaign for him before the election.\n\nMississippi voters will also choose their next governor that day after Gov. Phil Bryant (R) was term-limited. Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, the GOP nominee, is running against Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood. Mississippi hasn\u2019t elected a Democratic governor in two decades, but Hood has easily won his four prior statewide races for attorney general.\n\nAD", "description": "Gov.
