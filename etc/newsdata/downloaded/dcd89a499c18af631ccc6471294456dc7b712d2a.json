Wochit\n\nTerrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who the president said was killed during a special forces raid in Syria, had reportedly been the captor and tormentor of Arizona's Kayla Mueller, who was taken hostage in 2013.\n\n\u201cWhat this man did to Kayla \u2014 he kidnapped her,\u201d her father Carl Mueller, his voice choking, told The Arizona Republic on Sunday morning, shortly after President Donald Trump announced al-Baghdadi had died.\n\n\u201cShe was held in many prisons,\" Carl Mueller said. \"She was held in solitary confinement. She was tortured. She was intimidated. She was ultimately raped by al-Baghdadi himself.\"\n\n\"He either killed her or he was complicit in her murder,\" Carl Mueller said. \"I\u2019ll let people who read this article make up their own mind how a parent should feel.\u201d\n\nThe Muellers, in Prescott, said they had mixed emotions.They suspect had al-Baghdadi been caught alive rather than dead, he would not have been cooperative in sharing information.\n\n\u201cI still want to know, \u2018Where is Kayla?\u2019 and what truly happened to her and what aren\u2019t we being told,\u201d Marsha Mueller said. \u201cSomeone knows, and I\u2019m praying with all my heart that someone in this world will bring us those answers.\u201d\n\nFor more stories that matter: Click here to subscribe to azcentral.com.\n\nMueller grew up in Prescott and went to Northern Arizona University before traveling the world as an aid worker. While working in Turkey, she crossed into northern Syria with a companion to visit a hospital.\n\nMueller became one of four Americans held hostage by ISIS, though her family kept her captivity secret \u2014 complying, they said, with the demands they received from her captors and the urging of U.S. authorities who worked on her case.\n\nShe was kidnapped and held for 18 months before her death was announced in early 2015. Her parents, Carl and Marsha Mueller, eventually confirmed her death, but her body has never been recovered.\n\nFamily hopes for answers\n\nOn Sunday, the Muellers praised President Donald Trump and the soldiers who pulled off the mission.\n\n\"We are so grateful for them ... we are so grateful,\" Marsha Mueller said. They were glad there was no loss of life on our side. They are grateful their daughter and the others who were tortured and killed by ISIS have not been forgotten.\n\n\"I still say Kayla should be here, and if Obama had been as decisive as President Trump, maybe she would have been,\" Marsha Mueller said.\n\n\"For me what matters most I'm hoping now we will finally get the answers we have been asking for all along,\" Marsha Mueller said. \"I think this administration truly might help us. I don\u2019t think they are as closed about what happened.\"\n\nMORE: For Kayla Mueller's family, dark details of the past\n\nCarl Mueller said Trump mentioned his daughter twice in his morning press conference.\n\n\"He knows her story. He's been briefed on it, and he knows, and that\u2019s important to me,\" Carl Mueller said. \"I don\u2019t think anything would have stopped him from getting this guy.\"\n\nAfter Kayla's death, the Muellers became outspoken critics of the American government's handling of its foreign hostages. They had been encouraged to keep her captivity secret, and discouraged from attempting to free her or pay a ransom.\n\nCarl Mueller also became a vocal supporter of Trump's candidacy for president, speaking at his rallies on the campaign trail.\n\nCLOSE Kayla Mueller is seen in May 2013 working with Syrian refugee families in Turkey through an organization called Support to Life.

Soon, reports emerged that Umm Sayyaf had been responsible for holding Mueller captive so that al-Baghdadi could rape the American repeatedly.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department later issued a criminal complaint against Umm Sayyaf, alleging she conspired to support ISIS and was responsible for Mueller's death, as well as the captivity of others. \"The captives were at various times handcuffed, held in locked rooms, and Mueller was sexually abused by Baghdadi,\" Justice officials charged.\n\nUmm Sayyaf was handed over to the justice system of the Kurdish government in northern Iraq.

John McCain, at the time, questioned the decision not to extradite the woman.\n\nCarl Mueller hugs Senator John McCain during the grand opening of Kayla's Hands Playground in Prescott on August 27, 2016.

On Sunday, President Trump announced he had died after running from a house into a dead-end tunnel while being chased by United States Special Operations commandos in Northwest Syria.\n\n\"He was a sick and depraved man, and now he's gone,\" Trump said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/27/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-held-arizona-kayla-mueller-hostage/2479281001/", "description": "ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi \"either killed her or he was complicit in her (Kayla Mueller's) murder,\" father Carl Mueller says.", "authors": ["Karina Bland", "Published P.M.
