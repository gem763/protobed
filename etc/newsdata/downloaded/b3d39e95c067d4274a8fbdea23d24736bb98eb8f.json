Net revenue inched up to $10 billion from $9.9 billion.\n\nAnalysts were expecting a profit of $1.11 per share on revenue of $9.6 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nOverall sales and trading revenue rose 10%, driven mainly by a 21% jump in fixed-income sales and trading revenue.\n\nRevenue from investment banking, which includes advising on deals and helping corporations raise money, rose 4.3% to $1.64 billion.\n\nHowever, Morgan Stanley, which will handle Airbnb's much-awaited debut next year, swallowed heavy losses from stakes in companies that went public. Investment revenue plummeted to $33 million from $340 million a year ago.", "description": "Morgan Stanley profit beats as bond trading surges; shares jump 4%", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9G13S_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
