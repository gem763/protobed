Photo: Oliver Contreras/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nWith no warning, President Trump announced on Tuesday that John Bolton, the bellicose national security adviser whose instinct for foreign intervention has clashed with the president\u2019s relative dovishness, is no longer working in the White House.\n\nI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2019\n\n....I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2019\n\nBolton was Trump\u2019s third national security adviser, after Michael Flynn (who may be on his way to prison) and H.R. McMaster (whom Trump apparently now misses). Deputy National Security Adviser Charlie Kupperman, a close aide of Bolton\u2019s, was announced as his temporary replacement.\n\nBolton responded to the news of his departure almost immediately on Twitter, seeming to dispute the details of how, exactly, he was let go.\n\nI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \"Let's talk about it tomorrow.\" \u2014 John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) September 10, 2019\n\nA few minutes later, Fox News\u2019 Brian Kilmeade received a text from Bolton claiming that he did, in fact, resign. But Bolton continued to maintain that he was never explicitly asked to do so.\n\nJohn Bolton tells me it is \u201cflatly wrong\u201d to say the President asked him to resign. \"I offered to resign last night,\" Bolton told me. \"He never asked for me to resign directly or indirectly. I slept on it and resigned this morning.\" \u2014 Jonathan Karl (@jonkarl) September 10, 2019\n\nJust an hour before Trump\u2019s tweets, Bolton was leading a meeting about refugee admissions. He had also fired off a characteristically aggressive tweet about Iran on Tuesday morning. And the White House had scheduled an afternoon press conference featuring Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the news came down.\n\nBolton\u2019s many detractors, including at least one lawmaker in his own party, were happy to see him gone.\n\n\u201cThe threat of war world wide goes down exponentially with John Bolton out of the White House\u201d - Senator Rand Paul \u2014 Saher Khan (@SaherMKhan) September 10, 2019\n\nBut Senator Mitt Romney said he was \u201cvery, very unhappy\u201d that Bolton was out, and other Republican lawmakers, including Senator Lindsey Graham, had kind things to say about him.\n\nDating back to Bolton\u2019s stint as undersecretary of state and ambassador to the United Nations and beyond, the mustachioed hawk has maintained a reputation as a ferocious political infighter who tends to alienate those who work for and around him \u2014 including Pompeo, with whom he reportedly had a strained relationship.\n\nBolton\u2019s bomb-first-ask-questions-later philosophy also stood in stark contrast to President Trump\u2019s less martial instincts. On Venezuela, Iran, and North Korea, Bolton has consistently advocated for a more aggressive posture than his boss.\n\nThe latest issue to divide the two was Afghanistan; Bolton disagreed strongly with Trump\u2019s decision to invite Taliban negotiators to Camp David, and did not think the president should support the peace deal he came close to approving. Though the Taliban meeting was ultimately called off and the deal is off the table for now, the New York Times reports that Trump was \u201cirritated\u201d with Bolton over his objections, and that Bolton\u2019s attempt to portray Vice-President Pence as similarly opposed to the peace deal may have been the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. For Bolton\u2019s part, he said it was an \u201caccumulation of things\u201d that led to his resignation.\n\nWith their markedly different philosophies on foreign conflict, Trump and Bolton were an unlikely pair from the start. But Axios reported earlier this year that the president saw him as a \u201cbad cop\u201d who could increase the White House\u2019s leverage against adversaries. But Bolton\u2019s tendency to get under his co-workers\u2019 skin apparently outweighed his value in negotiations.\n\nAt Tuesday afternoon\u2019s press conference, which went ahead with just Pompeo and Mnuchin on Tuesday, the pair did not exactly seem upset about their colleagues\u2019 departure.\n\nTwo dudes super-bummed their co-worker got fired pic.twitter.com/1SrZ74lIZy \u2014 Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) September 10, 2019\n\nLater on Tuesday, Bolton made things official with his resignation letter, which, like the man, was unsentimental.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
