And the number of apprehensions and people found inadmissible last month was significantly lower than the peak in May of 144,000. In all, Morgan said, CBP's enforcement actions at the border totaled close to one million.\n\nThose figures indicate that President Donald Trump's various attempts at curbing illegal immigration \u2014 a key promise of his presidency \u2014 may be having some effects, despite numerous legislative and legal setbacks.\n\nEven without a breakdown of the number of border arrests for the year, Border Patrol has already apprehended the largest number of migrants crossing the southwest border since 2007, when they apprehended more than 858,000, according to CBP data.\n\nAnd despite illegal immigration\u2019s status as a pet issue for Trump, apprehensions in fiscal 2019 had already exploded relative to the year before, when Border Patrol reported nearly 400,000 for the entire year.\n\nMorgan on Monday hailed September\u2019s lower figures as \u201can unprecedented achievement,\u201d noting that last month was the fourth month in a row that Border Patrol \u201caveraged 25 percent lower than the last four months.\u201d\n\nHe used the occasion to ding congressional Democrats for inaction on the surge of migrants coming to the border, proclaiming that \"while Congress has failed to support a single piece of legislation, even introducing it to the floor, we have addressed the crisis.\"\n\nMorgan also said that there was still work to be done, noting that though the number of daily border crossings had dropped from 5,000 four months ago to less than 1,700 presently, he aimed for a daily goal of 500.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/38/61/ead473e846ae83aa1a760cf989d8/191008-mark-morgan-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
