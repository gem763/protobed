He added he thought it would \"the worst movie ever.\"\n\nHe also didn't know who Amy Heckerling or Scott Rudin was, so he didn't know it had some pretty big names behind it.\n\nRudin is actually one of the only producers to have an EGOT - Emmy, Grammy, Tony and Oscar wins.\n\nIn fact, he thought the lines in the movie were \"crazy,\" so for the audition, he drew inspiration from his buddies.\n\nHis nuanced jokes from several sources worked and got him the role.\n\n\"'Keeping it real' came from me,\" he said. \"I heard it in my neighborhood.\"\n\n\"We were all literally kids,\" he said of the cast, adding the jokes came from honesty. \"Paul [Rudd] was the only one in the cast who could drink at the time.\"\n\nHe later revealed that the first time he legally got a drink was with Rudd and Alicia Silverstone.
