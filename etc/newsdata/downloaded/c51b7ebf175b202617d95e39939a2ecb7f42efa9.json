They are equally important to us and we are taking every possible step to flourish the game for women across the country,\u201d he said while talking to the media on the sidelines of the first T20I match between Pakistan women and Bangladesh women at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore.\n\nKhan is delighted to have the support of cricket boards around the world to revamp international cricket in Pakistan. \u201cAfter men\u2019s cricket, now international women\u2019s cricket has also revived in Pakistan. We are thankful to the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) for sending their women\u2019s team here. I hope more international teams will come to Pakistan in the near future,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CEO urged cricket fans in Lahore to fill the Gaddafi Stadium during the series to give confidence to the women cricketers. The entry to the stadium is free.\n\n\u201cI would like to request Lahoris to come in numbers to support women cricketers,\u201d he concluded.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that Pakistan women beat Bangladesh women by 14 runs in the first T20I.
