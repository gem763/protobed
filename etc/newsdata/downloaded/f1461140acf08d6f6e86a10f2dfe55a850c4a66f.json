The theory links back right to the beginning of Stranger Things, when Mr Clarke explains to the boys how they could (theoretically) rescue Will from the Upside Down.\n\nThe show uses the analogy of an acrobat, a tightrope and a flea: Mr Clarke says that our own dimension is a tightrope. An acrobat can only travel forwards and backwards on the tightrope, he can\u2019t go anywhere else because gravity holds him down. But a flea (aka Will, who travelled to the Upside Down) can use the same tightrope in a different way. It can travel up and down, it can basically travel between dimensions.\n\nThe theory is, then, that Hopper has now become that flea. The explosion at the Gate dispersed him through time, probably even dimensions, meaning the sheriff can travel between our world and the Upside Down.\n\nThe scene in the show is remarkably similar to a scene in Interstellar \u2013 which basically boils down to the fact that if our dimension is a straight line on a piece of paper, to travel to another dimension, you have to bend the paper around you and break through to get to the other side.\n\nHopper has also been manipulating the events of the show in tiny ways, thanks to some stuffed animals\n\nNow, here\u2019s where things get a bit trickier. If we accept that at the end of season three Hopper may have accidentally traveled between dimensions, the fan also suggests that he also travelled through time as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA nice example of this \u2013 and some handy foreshadowing that\u2019s been staring fans in the face since literally day one \u2013 is the appearance of three similar stuffed animal toys, which popped up across different points in time during the show\u2019s history. One is with Will in his cubbyhole in the Upside Down, the other is held by Hopper\u2019s now-dead daughter \u2013 who died on cancer before the start of the series \u2013 and the third is found in Eleven\u2019s room in Hawkins lab before she escaped.\n\nThe fan explains these three toys hint at a connection between the three characters, with the most notable binding factor between the three of them being Hopper. They say this visual link is enough to convince them that Hopper has been travelling through time \u2013 and dimensions! \u2013 trying to help Will, Sarah and Eleven in small ways, such as helping to comfort them with a cuddly toy.\n\nDavid Harbour knows what\u2019s happening and is teasing fans on Instagram\n\nThe eagle-eyed sleuth that runs this Instagram account also handily tagged a few posts from David Harbour\u2019s official account.\n\nAnd all this talk about the refraction of light and adding new dimensions now has us pretty much convinced that Harbour has known all along what Hopper\u2019s fate is and he\u2019s basically trolling fans through social media.\n\nThe search for answers, however, does continue and won\u2019t actually be solved until Stranger Things drops its fourth season. The good news, however, is that the show has officially been renewed at Netflix, and the sci-fi serial will be returning to the streaming service to answer fan\u2019s burning questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStranger Things seasons one to three are available to stream on Netflix. Season four is expected to drop in 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
