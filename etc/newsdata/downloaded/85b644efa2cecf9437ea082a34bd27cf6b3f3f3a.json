What do you do when it feels like you were your partner\u2019s second choice? How do you not feel like you\u2019re the runner up after hearing all about how amazing their ex was? What about when your fianc\u00e9e is convinced that you\u2019re cheating on them\u2026 to the point of forbidding you from seeing your friends? And how do you learn to let go of your ex when seeing who even looks like them drives a knife through your heart?\n\nIt\u2019s time to get up with the sun and plow some fertile fields. Let\u2019s do this.\n\nHello Doctor, I\u2019m hoping you can offer me some advice on an issue I\u2019ve been facing for years. My husband and I have been married for five years, but the woman prior to me was a powerful and beloved chunk of his life. He loved her deeply, wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. She, however, decided to cheat on him and couldn\u2019t handle the guilt of doing so. So she broke up with him. This led to my husband wrestling with crippling depression for years up until he started dating me. In the beginning of our initial friendship, he detailed his love and longing for her. I was trying to be a friend and listened to all the reasons why he loved her so much. We weren\u2019t dating at the time \u2014 or even talking about it \u2014 so he felt free to spill his guts out. This included his romantic feelings as well as his sexual desires for her. Knowing all of this has made it hard to move forward. I know he\u2019s moved on with me, I know he loves me, but I still remember all his profound words of love for this other woman. I feel like his second choice. I firmly believe that had he been given a choice, he\u2019d have married and lived happily with this other woman. How do I cope with this? Second Place, First Loser\n\nYou\u2019re looking at this the wrong way, SPFL. You met your husband at what was, undoubtedly, one of the lowest points in his life. He had what he thought was the perfect relationship, and then discovered that it was nothing of the sort. Suddenly he\u2019s having to question everything about him. Part of why break-ups \u2014 especially from long-term partners \u2014 are so hard is that we have restructured our lives around being part of a couple.\n\nWhen that relationship ends, in a very real way, it\u2019s like losing a limb. We have to relearn how to be single again and deal with the phantom pain of all of those habits and patterns we\u2019ve developed over the years we were with our partners.Combine that with the way that finding out your partner cheated can feel like an attack on your sense of self\u2026 yeah, dude was gonna be fucked up for a while.\n\nIn the aftermath of a break-up, it\u2019s really easy to gloss over the bad parts and see your ex as this vision of perfection. It\u2019s part of dealing with the shock of it all; you\u2019re clinging to a golden version of the past instead of dealing with the awful reality you\u2019re facing. So I\u2019m not terribly surprised that he was going on and on about how amazing she was, how her farts smelled like roses and the way she chewed her food was the most adorable thing ever.\n\nI mean, I can relate. There was a point when I thought I had the perfect job and the perfect girlfriend\u2026 then I lost both within the span of a week. For a solid year afterwards, if you asked me what I thought of my ex, I would\u2019ve gone on about how this was the greatest relationship I ever had and I\u2019d never see its like again.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: that shit fades. As we give ourselves closure and get distance and perspective from those relationships, we start to realise that no, it wasn\u2019t perfection. It wasn\u2019t this idyll that only poets could properly express, it was just two people bumping awkwardly against one another and trying to make things work. While we may have some nostalgia for the we way we felt, we move on. Eventually, we find love again. It isn\u2019t the same kind of love, because we\u2019re not the same person we were. That doesn\u2019t make the next relationship better or worse, just different.\n\nLet yourself accept that he genuinely loves and cares for you.\n\nThe only time when this doesn\u2019t happen is when someone can\u2019t let go of their past and their ex. And I hate to say this, but I think the person who\u2019s most hung on on your husband\u2019s ex is\u2026 well, you, SPFL.\n\nThe problem here is that you heard him pouring his freshly-broken heart out to you and took what he was saying as both gospel and eternal, and neither of these were the case. He was in mourning and feeling the fuck out of his feels, and at the time, he was telling you what he believed to be true. And yeah, if at the time, someone could change his timeline so his ex never cheated, I\u2019m sure he would\u2019ve leapt at that so hard he\u2019d bend time and relative dimensions in space. But they didn\u2019t, and he couldn\u2019t. So he did what we all do: he mourned, he found acceptance and closure and he moved on.\n\nAnd in doing so, he found a trusted friend who was there for him, who helped light his darkest hour. Over time, feelings grew, love bloomed again and he chose to marry you. I want to drive that home: he chose to marry you. He didn\u2019t sit around hoping to get his ex back. He didn\u2019t spend all of his time trying to bring back a future that could never be. He moved on and found you and he\u2019s been with you for years.\n\nI\u2019m a big believer in \u201cdeeds, not words,\u201d and it doesn\u2019t sound to me like he\u2019s ever given you any reason to feel like you\u2019re his runner up choice. You\u2019re not what he picked because he couldn\u2019t have her; you\u2019re the one he wants because you\u2019re not her. You\u2019re who he chose because he grew and became a different person and that person loves you.\n\nWith love comes trust. If you love him, then you have to be willing to trust him when he tells you that he loves you and that he wants to be with you. If you need a little reassurance every once in a while, ask for that. Ask him to tell you why he loves you and why he\u2019s happy to be with you. And when he does, you need to let yourself believe him. Because I\u2019m here to tell you: telling someone that you don\u2019t believe they actually love you \u2014 despite all evidence to the contrary \u2014 is a hurtful thing to do.\n\nHe loves you. You love him. Let yourself accept that he genuinely loves and cares for you. Otherwise all you\u2019re doing is letting someone else\u2019s ghosts keep you from having an amazing, wonderful relationship.\n\nGood luck.\n\nDear Dr. NerdLove, First, I wanted to say thanks for taking the time to drop some advice for me for my situation. I enjoy reading your responses to issues regarding relationships. It helps to reflect on what I have done poorly and things I may have missed in my previous relationships. My situation is similar in aspect to a few of those you have published recently on both your blog and Kotaku, albeit with subtle differences. I began to date a girl earlier this year. We matched through one of the dating apps. Unbeknownst to me at the time, because she did not list these on her profile, she was recently divorced (and still dealing with the legal aspect of it), and she also had a son. These two items are preferences I avoid when using dating apps; I am the type of person who wants a fresh start with the person I am dating (i.e. never married, no kids). I was breaking a barrier with this one and wanted to just run with it. We were messaging for about a week before we met for our first date. When we met in person, the energy and electricity was incredibly palpable. We both felt it immediately, and needless to say, almost kissed within the first 15 seconds. We also met at a time where I was in a very bad spot; I was battling through heartbreak after a falling out with a best friend of mine who I had feelings for. I spoke about this early on, so she could be aware of any aloofness on my part. She recognised it before I told her, and luckily for me it did not scare her away. I was super appreciative of her patience with me with that. We became exclusive a week and a half after our first date. She became my first girlfriend/relationship in 6 years (due to career choices on my end) and the first woman whom I said \u201cI Love You\u201d to in 7 years. It was not an easy thing for me to do or come around to doing. We talked early on about the future, plans, and where we see ourselves a few years down the road. I\u2019m not a serial dater and I want to settle down, start a life, and eventually a family, with a potential future spouse. Even though she already had a son, she wanted more kids. There was also a religious aspect in play, that she would\u2019ve compromised on for me. After 3 months of dating, I broke things off with her. During these 3 months, red flags were abundant from both sides because we were both on opposite ends of the spectrum with our personalities and lifestyles. But with the relationship in its early stages I wanted to be as flexible as possible knowing we were in a Struggle Stage. We clashed a lot, mainly because she is not a very good logical thinker. At the same time, our opposite personalities complemented one another cohesively. The one area we were very compatible was intimacy in the bedroom. The final straw for me was, for the third instance in as many months, she went and made a decision; one that had a direct impact on our relationship and did not consult with or start a dialogue with me regarding the situation before acting on that decision (and no, she did not cheat on me). At the end of the day, I fully support her decision and would have done so even if she had brought it up to me before acting on her decision. Her decision truly gutted me, in a sense, and I felt the sensation of someone repeatedly stabbing me for a few weeks after we broke up. I never confronted her about it, and I am still angry about it (because I have a very difficult time letting things go). After a few weeks had passed I was getting back to normal, going on a few dates and wound up dating another girl for a month. One evening I saw a woman who looked a lot like her at a restaurant and it triggered me into an internal rage because of what transpired at the end of the relationship. It took me a few more weeks to really calm down just from that episode. It has now been 5 months since we broke up and I still haven\u2019t seen her since we broke up. I do not want to get back together with my ex. I am not having a difficult time getting over her but it\u2019s driving me nuts that I can\u2019t get her out of my head. It doesn\u2019t help the fact that I see her make/model car on the highway (hers is a very popular car model). I had to stop watching porn after we broke up because I would instantly think of her in the bedroom (which in all honesty is for the best because I\u2019ve been wanting to kick the porn habit for some time anyway). Which is why I am writing to you. I know that over time, everything settles down and eventually wounds heal. But why is it that this girl has dominantly taken over my thoughts, when I know without a doubt, I don\u2019t ever want to be with her again? Could it be because I have a difficult time letting situations go? Is it because I did not get any closure in the final instance of the relationship? Or could it be because I feel guilty that a partner considered me as having all the qualities she wants in a future husband (and yes, she did tell me this)? I know you\u2019re not a psychic, but could you provide some insight as to why it is taking almost double the amount of time to get her out of my head? Sincerely, Ghost of Girlfriends Past\n\nSo GoGP, I picked your letter because it parallels rather nicely with Second Place, First Loser\u2019s; she\u2019s worried her husband is still pining with his ex. Meanwhile we have your situation, as you find it hard to get over yours, for similar reasons: you feel as though you were wronged and the fact that you haven\u2019t gotten closure has left you with an open emotional wound.\n\nNow before we get into what you need to do, I want to walk you through how you\u2019ve ended up in this place, because it\u2019s pretty damn relevant and it\u2019s going to inform how you ultimately get over her. And this is going to sound harsh, but your first mistake was getting with this woman in the first place. This was a relationship that honestly shouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place and almost certainly not at the pace you proceeded at.\n\nThe first issue is that she had a couple major dealbreakers that you chose to overlook. And honestly, that\u2019s not really the problem; if you decide you\u2019re willing to be flexible about things, more power to you. The bigger problem is that she was actively hiding these on her dating profile.\n\nBeing in the middle of getting a divorce isn\u2019t much of an issue, but not mentioning that she has a child is a pretty big one. Being a single parent has a pretty significant effect on your life, especially your dating life; it dictates your priorities and your availability. That\u2019s something that folks have a right to know about in order to make an informed decision about whether they want to date you. Her leaving those off her profile are a not-insignificant detail.\n\nThe next issue is that you were exclusive within a week and a half and saying \u201cI love you\u201d not too much longer after that. That is really goddamn fast, and an indicator that this relationship is progressing to a level of seriousness that you weren\u2019t prepared for. I get that the two of you had more chemistry than an entire season of Breaking Bad but a week and a half is the \u201cI don\u2019t know you at all\u201d stage.\n\nThat\u2019s barely enough time to have had a second date. That\u2019s a level of emotional investment that is far out of proportion to the state of the relationship, and a pretty solid indicator that you weren\u2019t making sound emotional decisions. Whether you were lonely, feeling like you needed to lock this down before she could get away or just so twitterpated that you got carried away, this was a recipe for the heartbreak that was coming down the line.\n\nSmall wonder you broke up within three months; you didn\u2019t know this woman at all, certainly not well enough to be making any sort of commitment beyond \u201cHey, brunch next Sunday?\u201d You weren\u2019t at a point where you knew how she takes her coffee in the morning, never mind being willing to fart in front of one another, and you\u2019re already talking about marriage, kids and the house with the white picket fence.\n\nSo you\u2019re going to have to decide that you have closure.\n\nThe fact that you were having these serious conflicts in those three months were another indicator that this was a relationship that should never have reached this stage. You were dead-bang in the middle of the honeymoon stage, when you\u2019re both fuck-drunk on all of the dopamine and oxytocin from the novelty of a new partner and you are constantly butting heads. If you\u2019re in the \u201cstruggle stage\u201d at three months, that\u2019s not a time to \u201cbe flexible,\u201d that\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re with the wrong person and you should peace out of the entire relationship.\n\nBut you didn\u2019t, and so here we are.\n\nThe reason why I bring all of this up is because it\u2019s exactly the reason why you\u2019re having such a hard time with all of this. You made the wrong play and got hung up on someone who was incredibly wrong for you. If you\u2019d just kept this to \u201cwe\u2019re great in bed and absolutely nowhere else,\u201d then you wouldn\u2019t be having these moments where you freak out seeing someone who vaguely looks like her.\n\nYou\u2019d have had a few months of casual sex that would\u2019ve burned itself out and you\u2019d both go on your merry way.\n\nThe reason why you\u2019re so upset right now is because you\u2019re not angry at her, per se; you\u2019re angry at yourself. Trust me, I know. I\u2019ve been there, done that and printed the shirt.\n\n(No for real; I\u2019m setting up a line of merch as we speak.)\n\nThat whole \u201cstab in the gut because you saw someone with her hair?\u201d I\u2019ve felt that. The \u201coh shit is that her car?\u201d and looking for distinctive signs that it\u2019s not just another lookalike? Yup, played that game more times than I can count.\n\nIt\u2019s reflected anger. Yeah, she did you dirty, but if you sit and think about it for more than a few seconds, you realise that what happened wasn\u2019t that bad. You\u2019re more angry at yourself because you made a mistake and it\u2019s really hard to accept it. You\u2019re basically punishing yourself because let yourself fall for someone who you knew wasn\u2019t right for you. That stabbing feeling is as much self-recrimination as it is \u201cthere she is, the one as what broke my heart.\u201d\n\nHow do you get over this? Well, to start with, allow me to let you in on a little secret: you\u2019re not going to get closure from this, because closure is something that you give yourself.\n\nNine times out of ten, when we look for closure from our exes, what we\u2019re actually looking for is validation. We want them to say \u201chey, you\u2019re right, I was the arsehole and you\u2019re totally justified in being pissed about this.\u201d But you\u2019re not going to get that. Break-ups are rarely so black and white and even when they are, our exes rarely see themselves as the villain of the piece. So if you\u2019re hoping to get the satisfaction of her acknowledging how she broke your heart\u2026 well, it\u2019s not gonna happen.\n\nSo you\u2019re going to have to decide that you have closure.\n\nYou have to be the one to decide how you\u2019re going to draw the curtain on this part of your life, a way of demarcating the difference between the time before your ex and after. It may be as constructive as starting a new hobby or investing in advancing your career. It may be as simple as a new haircut, a long weekend away or just pulling the trigger on something you\u2019ve been planning on doing for a while but have never gotten around to.\n\nOnce you do that, the next step is that you have to forgive yourself. You need to look at everything about this relationship \u2014 all those red flags and mistakes I listed earlier \u2014 and accept that you shouldn\u2019t have let things get this far. Resolve to not make these mistakes again in the future. And then forgive yourself for loving not wisely but too well. Choose to let go of the pain and the recrimination, understand that you know yourself a little better now and then forgive yourself for being a fool for love.\n\nAnd honestly, that\u2019s not a bad thing to be.\n\nGood luck.\n\nHey Doc, I\u2019ve been struggling recently with an issue I have with my fianc\u00e9e of 5 years. About two months ago I went on a work conference trip to Nashville. I usually only have this time to meet with my fellow managers because we live and work so far apart. Most of the time after we were done with \u201cwork\u201d for the day, we would go out to bars and have dinner out on the town. I wanted to become better friends with my co-workers, so I went out to socialise. This is where the first issue began. My fianc\u00e9e did not like that I was going around all the time with one of my female coworkers. I did not understand the problem, as she is engaged herself, and that we\u2019ve known each other for so long. We\u2019re just good friends who have similar interests in things like video games; I have no romantic or sexual feelings for her. After I got back from Nashville, we would text on occasion; we spent one day texting late into the night because we were discussing Fire Emblem: Three Houses and the different story options we had received. That\u2019s when the second issue came up. My fianc\u00e9e had looked in my phone and saw I had been texting my friend in the middle of the night and became very upset. She stormed out of the house early in the morning because she did not like how \u201cchummy\u201d I was with my co-worker. This is when my fianc\u00e9e explained that she did not like how much time I was spending my off time with her. Again, her problem was with this specific female co-worker, as opposed to the other co-workers I was also with. My fianc\u00e9e also did not like how she had asked me if I wanted to go see IT Chapter 2 with her and some of our co-workers from other stores. My fianc\u00e9e summed it up by saying \u201cif you invite someone that is engaged you\u2019re supposed to invite their significant other too.\u201d I could just use some advice as to how I can bridge the subject of talking to my co-worker with my fianc\u00e9e without upsetting her. My co-worker is a good friend of mine and I enjoy talking to her on occasion but now I\u2019m forbidden from speaking to her forever it seems. Any time I tried to talk about it my fianc\u00e9e would just become very defensive and offended about it and how I betrayed her trust by \u201ctalking to other girls.\u201d Also when I would have to go for work reasons to my co-worker\u2019s store she would make a snide comment about having to go see her. I don\u2019t really know what to say to her. I\u2019d like to keep my relationship with my fianc\u00e9e but also hate that I have to stone cold stop talking to my co-worker and block her number and then pretend everything is OK whenever I see her at work, on a conference call or go to her store. Help? Short Leash\n\nFirst of all, your fianc\u00e9e of five years? I\u2019m wondering if you mean that you\u2019ve been with your fianc\u00e9e for five years, not that you\u2019ve been engaged for five years.\n\nThough honestly, if this is how she\u2019s acting, I\u2019m not terribly surprised that you haven\u2019t set a date yet.\n\nSo straight up, SL: your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s behaviour is appalling and unacceptable. You\u2019re allowed to have friends and a life outside of your relationship. You\u2019re allowed to have friends of different genders. You\u2019re allowed to talk with them, spend time with them and even text them late into the night. As long as you aren\u2019t neglecting your partner to spend time with your friends, you\u2019re not really doing anything wrong.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, is crossing all kinds of boundaries and that shit ain\u2019t cool. Snooping through your phone, giving you shit for hanging out with your friends without her, forbidding you from seeing people and complaining that you\u2019re betraying her trust by \u201ctalking with other girls\u201d \u2014 all of those are huge relationship red flags and honestly, at this point, I\u2019d have one foot out the door if I were you.\n\nIf you want to try to fix things with your fianc\u00e9e, then you two need to sit down \u2014 ideally with a relationship counsellor \u2014 and talk this out. It may be that your fianc\u00e9e is feeling neglected and that you\u2019re spending more time with your friends, especially this particular co-worker, than you are with her.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then it may be possible to sort things out. She might just need some reassurance that you still love and care for her and that everything is cool. You can even bring up that your co-worker is happily engaged and that the two of you are entirely on the up and up.\n\nBut just between you, me and everyone reading this? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna work. Your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s behaviour is incredibly controlling and borderline toxic. If she\u2019s gotten to the point that talking to women is a betrayal and going through your phone for evidence that you\u2019re cheating on her, then the relationship\u2019s already on the downward slide.\n\nI think at this point, it\u2019d be better for you to take a good hard look at how your fianc\u00e9e is treating you and ask yourself how long you\u2019d be willing to put up with this, knowing it will never change. Five more years? One year? Six months?\n\nBecause honestly? That shit isn\u2019t gonna get better. And you deserve better. You deserve a fianc\u00e9e who trusts you, who lets you have your own friends and your own life and doesn\u2019t treat you like a cheater waiting to happen.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this position. You\u2019ve got some thinking to do, and I don\u2019t envy the decisions you have to make.\n\nGood luck.
