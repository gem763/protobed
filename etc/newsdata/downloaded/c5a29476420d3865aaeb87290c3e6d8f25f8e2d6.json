REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nMSCI\u2019s world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, reversed earlier losses and was trading flat by 1120 GMT. It was still heading towards its worst weekly performance since mid-August, though. Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 index fared better, adding 0.5% as London\u2019s bourse outperformed on a weaker pound and hopes grew of progress towards resolving the trade war. Wall Street futures also suggested a bright start for U.S. markets, gaining around 0.3%.\n\nInvestors focussed on a whistleblower report that said Trump abused his office in trying to solicit Ukraine\u2019s interference in the 2020 U.S. election for his political benefit, and that the White House tried to \u201clock down\u201d evidence about that conduct.\n\nThe report came after the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi this week launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump, who has denied wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, chances of his being removed from office look slim given that the Republicans control the Senate, where any impeachment trial would be held.\n\n\u201cWhat we are waiting to see is how this might impact the U.S.-China trade negotiations,\u201d said Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that combination this week of weakening economic data and rising political uncertainty that has caused some tricky periods in markets.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS had been buffeted by the political worries in the United States and shed 0.3%.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY measuring it against a basket of currencies was up 0.1% near a three-week high of 99.146, and on track for its best week in a month.\n\nBalancing worries over the ramifications of any possible impeachment of Trump was an apparent easing of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.\n\nThe trade war has upset financial markets and disrupted global supply chains as the world\u2019s two largest economies heap hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs on each other\u2019s products.\n\nChina\u2019s top diplomat said on Thursday that China was willing to buy more U.S. products and that trade talks would yield results.\n\nThose comments fuelled the positive mood after Trump on Wednesday praised the Chinese purchases, saying a trade deal could come sooner than people thought.\n\n\u201cTrade... remains the most important issue for markets, and the news that we have had over the last couple of weeks I would see as gestures of goodwill from both sides - trying to set up a more constructive negotiation in a couple of weeks\u2019 time,\u201d Gimber added.\n\nEuropean shares reacted well to those signals, also getting a boost from moves in currency markets. London stocks .FTSE added 1%, with exporters buoyed by a weaker pound central bank policymaker hinted at a cut in UK interest rates.\n\nSterling GBP=D3 was a other big loser in early London trading, weakening 0.3% after Bank of England policymakers Michael Saunders signalled a possible rate cut amid Brexit uncertainty and disappointing global growth.\n\nMeanwhile the euro EUR=EBS was pinned at its lowest level since May 2017 as a steady drip of negative economic data this week sapped investor demand for the single currency, further helping export-oriented European stocks.\n\nA key market gauge of the euro zone\u2019s inflation expectations fell to its lowest level since early July on Friday, reflecting growing concern that the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus will be unable to fuel price pressures.\n\nSCEPTICISM ON MAJOR DEAL\n\nWashington and China are preparing for another round of trade talks scheduled for Oct. 10 and 11, but investors voiced scepticism at prospects of a major breakthrough then.\n\n\u201cThere is still a huge gulf,\u201d said Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes Investment Management, adding that prospects for a deal had receded from earlier in the year.\n\n\u201cAround April, May time, the main sticking point was the enforcement mechanism - but we have retreated miles from that at this point.\u201d\n\nTech remains a sticking point, with reports on Thursday that the United States is unlikely to allow American firms to supply China\u2019s Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] undermining hopes of a broad bilateral deal.\n\nUnderlining market sensitivity, European chipmakers Infineon (IFXGn.DE) and Siltronic (WAFGn.DE) both fell around 1.5%, mirroring losses for Asian chip-related shares Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and SK Hynix (000660.KS).\n\nMajor Huawei supplier Micron Technology (MU.O) had fallen 7% in after-hours trade after it forecast first-quarter profit below Wall Street targets.\n\nIn commodity markets, Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell $1, or 1.5%, to $61.74 a barrel, weighed down by slowing Chinese economic growth that dampens the demand outlook and a faster-than-expected recovery in Saudi output.", "description": "World shares erased losses on Friday, buoyed by a wave of optimism that U.S.-China trade tensions might be easing as markets largely brushed off concerns about possible impeachment moves against U.S. President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Tom Wilson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434471137&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0KV", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
