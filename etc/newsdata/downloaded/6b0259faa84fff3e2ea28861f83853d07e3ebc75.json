Those shares have now dropped to $31 as of time of publication.\n\nWhile Twitter's revenue rose 9 percent from a year earlier to $824 million, the company missed its Wall Street expectations of $874 million, based on data from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System (IBES) by Refinitiv.\n\nTwitter stocks plummeted after the company reported lower-than-expected ad revenue on Thursday\n\nTotal advertising revenue was $702 million, an increase of 8 percent year-over-year but fell well short of the $756 million in expected advertising revenue.\n\nTwitter forecast that third quarter revenue growth would lag partly due to ending older ad formats, but also encountered unexpected problems, like bugs that impacted its ability to target ads and share data with partners.\n\nAmong those bugs was a flaw in its data collection practices during which the company harvested device-specific information from users even after they declined to give the platform permission.\n\nThis resulted in the company shutting down the practice and impacted its ability to target ads - one of the primary business models of major social platforms like Twitter and Facebook.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Twitter expects total revenue to be between $940 million and $1.01 billion. Wall Street on average expects $1.06 billion.\n\nOn the bright side, Twitter says it recorded a rise in daily users who see ads on the site, beating analyst estimates.\n\nTwitter's CEO Jack Dorsey said the growth in monetizable daily active usage (mDAU) was driven by product improvements, including making the site easier to navigate and more proactively identifying abusive content for removal.\n\nThe company's average monetizable user count hit 145 million, beating analyst expectations of 141 million, according to IBES data. This alternative metric was up 17 percent year-over-year.\n\nLikely bolstering user growth are a number of new features introduced by the platform over the last several months.\n\nThose include a more personalized desktop interface, the ability to follow topics, and test feature like being able to hide replies.\n\nThe company did experience growth in daily active users despite its bug-driven falter in ad revenue\n\nTwitter and other social media platforms will look to realign their target advertising practices amid a new wave of scrutiny over ad policies.\n\nTwitter, Facebook, and Google were recently criticized by US democratic presidential candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, for allowing politicians to run ads containing false or misleading claims.\n\nIn August, Twitter announced it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled news media outlets, shortly after it came under fire for showing ads from Chinese state-controlled media that criticized the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nTwitter also faced heat over its handling of user data when it said in October that email addresses and phone numbers uploaded by users to meet its security requirements may have been 'inadvertently' used for advertising purposes.\n\nThe company expects fourth-quarter operating income to be between $130 million and $170 million.", "description": "Among those bugs was a hitch in its data collection practices in which the company harvested device-specific information from users even after they declined to give the platform permission.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/16/20138796-0-image-a-17_1571930062925.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
