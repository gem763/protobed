REUTERS/Grant Lee Neuenburg/File Photo\n\nMAPUTO (Reuters) - Mozambique\u2019s main opposition party Renamo on Tuesday appealed the result of the Oct. 15 general election, calling on the country\u2019s top court to annul incumbent President Filipe Nyusi\u2019s victory.\n\nNyusi and his ruling Frelimo party won big in the election, which was hoped would calm tensions in Mozambique, soon to become a top global gas exporter. Instead, the contested result has stoked divisions as opposition parties have cried foul.\n\n\u201cWe want the election results to be annulled because they were not elections. They were a caricature, a circus show,\u201d Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane, a Renamo representative, told Reuters by phone.\n\n\u201cToday we filed the appeal to the Constitutional Council (CC) against the deliberation of the National Election Commission, which we do not agree with. We demand that the CC annul the election results,\u201d Mondlane said.\n\nIt was hoped the election could set the seal on a fragile peace pact, designed to put a definitive end to four decades of violence between Frelimo and Renamo.\n\nThe two fought a 16-year civil war that ended in a truce in 1992 but have clashed sporadically since.\n\nRenamo had wanted to win control of a number of provinces in Mozambique\u2019s centre and north but came away empty handed.", "description": "Mozambique's main opposition party Renamo on Tuesday appealed the result of the Oct. 15 general election, calling on the country's top court to annul incumbent President Filipe Nyusi's victory.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446452053&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0GT-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
