Now she wants other would-be victims to learn from her experience.\n\nAmy, a 50-year-old occupational therapist in Miami, says she and her husband, Michael Wang, started receiving credit-card denials and store credit cards in the mail in December of 2015. Eventually, they received actual bills from Macy\u2019s M, -1.01% and Bloomingdale\u2019s totaling north of $25,000.\n\nThe shoppers had expensive taste, Amy said, opting for luxuries like diamond earrings, Gucci and Armani. They made many of these purchases locally, she added \u2014 \u201cwithin a county or two from here\u201d and at most 100 miles away.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like every day we\u2019d get one \u2026 and another one, and another one, and another one,\u201d Amy told MarketWatch of the fraudulent correspondence. \u201cIt was like Whac-a-Mole.\u201d\n\nThe Wangs, to their dismay, had joined the millions of Americans whose identities are stolen and exploited every year.\n\nAbout 14.4 million people were victims of identity fraud in 2018, according to Javelin Strategy & Research, a decline from 2017\u2019s 16.7 million and a reversal from three consecutive years of fraud-rate increases. While that decline was driven by a reduction in card fraud, Javelin said, there was a \u201cresurgence of higher-impact fraud types such as new account fraud, account takeover, and misuse of non-card accounts.\u201d\n\nThings got even worse for the Wangs. In January 2016, the couple received a U.S. Postal Service change-of-address form in the mail. But the form didn\u2019t specify their supposed new address, Amy said. She called the postal service that day to try to rectify the address mistake, and only paid a visit to the post office two weeks later at the urging of her concerned mailman.\n\nPost-office officials advised her to contact the Federal Trade Commission and the nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), Amy said. The couple also filed a police report, which would come in handy when disputing fraudulent credit-card charges, she said.\n\nThe family stopped receiving mail for several weeks. Meanwhile, a veritable \u201cwindfall\u201d of sensitive documents sent during the beginning of the year \u2014 W2s, bank statements, tax forms, and information on college-savings and retirement funds linked to their three teenage children \u2014 was ostensibly routed to an unknown address, Amy said.\n\nCourtesy of Amy Wang The Wangs, to their dismay, had joined the millions of Americans whose identities are stolen and exploited every year.\n\nIt took nearly two months for the Wangs\u2019 regular mail cycle to resume, she said, but the thieves \u201caccessed so much\u201d in that time. \u201cIt was so shocking, because it cost nothing for them to do that \u2014 it was [potentially] a very low-tech way to attack people and access a lot of very valuable information,\u201d she said.\n\nThanks to a forwarding address printed on bank correspondence and some help from the local post office, she later discovered their mail was traveling to a low-income housing complex about five miles away from their home, though she was unable to narrow the address down to one of the dozens of units. Amy would describe at a 2017 FTC conference how \u201cquick and easy\u201d it was to change a person\u2019s address without much personal information.\n\nReached for comment about the Wangs\u2019 case, U.S. Postal Service spokesman David Partenheimer declined to comment on matters regarding individual customers. But the postal service \u201ccontinues to work on balancing the public need for a simple, efficient and accessible platform to handle millions of change of addresses each year with the important requirement of enhanced security protocols,\u201d he told MarketWatch in a statement.\n\n\u201cAs part of this process, the Postal Service requires its customers to show proper identification (ID) to change their address and when applying for other services at Post Offices,\u201d Partenheimer said. \u201cThe Postal Service will accept certain U.S. State or federal government IDs, U.S. or foreign passports, matricula consular (Mexico), or NEXUS (Canada). Additionally, a copy of the change of address request is sent to both the old and new address.\u201d\n\nThe Wangs froze their credit with the three major credit bureaus and successfully disputed the fraudulent charges from the thieves\u2019 five-figure shopping spree. They received an IRS Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN), which would prevent impostors from filing tax returns using their Social Security numbers, and changed passwords and account numbers associated with all of their bank accounts.\n\nBut since they weren\u2019t receiving their legitimate credit-card and utility bills during the mail stoppage, they still racked up between $300 and $500 in late fees, not all of which they were able to extinguish. What\u2019s more, Amy said, they spent a collective 200 to 300 hours working to resolve the fraud \u2014 \u201cnot to mention nights not being able to sleep.\u201d\n\nIn what Amy calls a \u201cdouble whammy,\u201d the ordeal also resulted in costs associated with rental properties she managed and was rehabbing at the time. The credit freeze required her to pass an authentication process in order to have utilities turned on at those properties \u2014 a process she would fail, she said, because of the amount of erroneous information now associated with her identity. She wound up having to send home workers she had hired \u2014 meaning lost wages for them \u2014 and forgo days\u2019 worth of rent money, she said.\n\nThe effects of identity fraud stretch well beyond the financial realm, Amy said; the couple took substantial hits to their time, productivity and emotional and psychological well-being. \u201cIt seems like a nameless, faceless thing, but it really hurts people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt causes distress. And for people who financially wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it \u2026 it would be far more detrimental.\u201d\n\nAbout three in four victims who responded to a 2017 ITRC survey reported that the misuse or attempted misuse of their personal information had been \u201cseverely distressing.\u201d Many respondents said they\u2019d felt rage or anger, fear over their financial security, or a sense of helplessness or powerlessness.\n\nAmy has a few theories as to how fraudsters could have infiltrated her family\u2019s sensitive information: For starters, she said, a generic letter from Wells Fargo WFC, +0.82% about 18 months earlier had informed them that a now-former employee had sold some of their personal information to a third party. And her husband, who works at a large hospital, had several coworkers hit by credit-card fraud in a pattern they speculated could be due to a potential HR data breach.\n\nToday, Amy says, she and Michael still fear what bad actors could do with their compromised personal information \u2014 particularly that of their kids, who are aged 15, 17 and 19. She likens the thieves to \u201csleeper cells\u201d lying in wait.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know at what point they can pop back up and use this information against them, especially when they become adults,\u201d she said. (Her 19-year-old hasn\u2019t run into any issues so far, she added.) \u201cWe always have this identity-theft PTSD: \u2018Oh no, it\u2019s starting again; it\u2019s starting again. We\u2019re not getting our mail.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmy believes she was \u201cvery naive\u201d when this trouble started and didn\u2019t act quickly enough. She urges people to look out for warning signs of identity fraud and follow up immediately on any suspicious communications they receive. If you are targeted, she added, keep a detailed record of calls made and steps taken in an identity-fraud \u201cfile.\u201d File a police report, she added.\n\nPartenheimer also encouraged customers to monitor their mail receipt by subscribing to the postal service\u2019s free \u201cInformed Delivery\u201d notification feature, and to report any suspicious activity or non-receipt of mail over a couple days to their local post office or the agency\u2019s tech-support line.\n\n\u201cListen; pay attention,\u201d Amy said. \u201cKnow what\u2019s going on so you don\u2019t become a victim.\u201d", "description": "The thieves had expensive taste, opting for luxuries like diamond earrings, Gucci and Armani.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ010_amy_MG_20190822182949.jpg"}
