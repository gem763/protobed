Only five people survived, all crew.\n\nThe scuba-diving boat caught fire on Monday as passengers slept below decks.\n\nTwenty bodies - 11 females and nine males - have been recovered but more remain in the submerged wreckage, officials said on Tuesday.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption People have left flowers at the dock where the Conception is based\n\nDivers will attempt to stabilise the 75ft-long (23m) vessel, the Conception, to recover the remaining victims.\n\nThe vessel is upside down in more than 60ft of water, officials said.\n\nWhen asked why DNA material would be necessary, Sheriff Brown told reporters it was an \"inordinately hot fire and the bodies do exhibit signs of extreme thermal damage\".\n\nAccording to preliminary reports, Sheriff Brown said, a 17-year-old and several people in their 60s were probably aboard the recreational diving vessel when it caught fire.\n\nImage copyright EPA/SANTA BARBARA COUNTY FIRE HANDOUT Image caption The boat was totally engulfed in flames as crews tried to rescue those onboard\n\nNo cause of the fire has yet been determined.\n\nWhat have authorities said?\n\nCaptain Monica Rochester of the US Coast Guard said search-and-rescue operations were suspended on Tuesday morning after a reconnaissance aircraft flew over the wreck and found \"no additional signs of distress or debris\".\n\nThe debris field spanned nearly 1.5 miles (2.4km), said Sheriff Brown. He said more than 160 miles of ocean had also been searched.\n\nCpt Rochester told reporters the boat had had an \"open berthing\" plan, meaning there were no locked doors onboard and curtains were used to section off different compartments, such as the sleeping quarters.\n\nImage copyright Getty/Ventura Country Fire Department Image caption Fire-fighters were unable to board the vessel to put it out as flames has already taken hold\n\nShe added that smoke detectors and fire-fighting systems were required to be on the boat, which had passed its most recent annual screening.\n\nWhen asked if the crew were required to post a night watch, Capt Rochester said that matter was still under investigation.\n\nHow did the crew survive?\n\nFive members of the boat's crew escaped the blaze and were able to steer another vessel to a nearby boat, the Grape Escape, where they called emergency services for help.\n\nSheriff Brown said the captain appears to have jumped into the water with others fleeing the burning boat.\n\nThe Conception was split into three decks, Sherriff Brown said, with the passengers being given the bottom level as their chambers.\n\nThe middle deck housed the boat's galley and salon, and the top deck was the crew's quarters and the boat's bridge, he said.\n\nHe said it was \"perfectly normal for the crew to be up on that assigned deck\" and closest to an exit when the fire broke out.\n\nWho was on the Conception?\n\nNone of those onboard have been formally identified, but family members have begun releasing the name of missing loved ones.\n\nThe brother of one marine biologist - 41-year-old Kristy Finstad - told US media she had been leading a dive trip and was presumed dead.\n\nThe Pacific Collegiate School in Santa Cruz said in a statement on its website that several of its students and parents were on the boat.\n\nThe trip was not part of the school curriculum, the statement added.\n\nSt Joseph's Medical Center in Stockton, California, said one of its nurses, Evan Quitasol, was on the ship, along with her father, Michael Quitasol, a former employee at the hospital.\n\nAnother former St Joseph's staff member, Fernisa Sison, was also on board, the hospital said.\n\nSusana Rosas, Evan's mother, wrote on Facebook that two of her other daughters were aboard the Conception.\n\nNicole Storm Solano Quitasol and Angela Rose Solano Quitasol were on a trip with her ex-husband, Michael, and his wife Fernisa Sison, she wrote.\n\nOn the eve of the disaster, three birthdays - including one for a 17 year old girl - had reportedly been celebrated by passengers on the doomed boat.\n\nActor Rob Lowe was among those paying tribute to victims, writing on Twitter that it was \"an unspeakable horror on a boat I've been on many times\".", "description": "Police say DNA is needed because many of the bodies show signs of \"extreme thermal damage\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mbb61.jpg"}
