If none of the candidates drop out between now and the debate \u2014 and Sanders participates in the debate after his recent heart procedure \u2014 it will surpass the previous record of 11 candidates on a primary debate stage, set by Republicans during the 2016 cycle.\n\nThe crowded stage is leading to some grumbling from Democrats, who are already conscious about their speaking time.\n\n\u201cI wish it was six and six,\u201d Klobuchar said during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival last the weekend . \u201cI actually think voters realize ... that it might be more important to see how someone actually answers a question, and what their actual plan is, and how it would affect them, than if they get the best zinger in, or viral moment. It is what it is. I will survive.\u201d\n\nThe debate stage will almost assuredly be larger, not smaller, than the previous debate in September. Two candidates who are set to participate on Oct. 15 \u2014 Steyer and Gabbard \u2014 did not qualify for that September debate. But rules laid out by the DNC gave them more time to make it on stage in October, expanding the field to 12.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is necessarily good. I think we\u2019re at a point [when] we\u2019re really down to five candidates that have actual traction, and you have a lot of people auditioning for something else,\u201d Chris Reeves, a DNC member from Kansas who is neutral in the presidential race, said. \u201cI think it is probably the best you can make of it \u2026 [but] I feel sorry for those people who have to stand on stage and be silent for long periods of time.\u201d Reeves said he would prefer higher thresholds to limit the number of candidates on stage.\n\nBut there\u2019s also some upside to having all the candidates together on one stage. Democrats are asking voters to tune in for only one night. And having all the candidates on one stage means that all of the top-tier candidates are guaranteed to share the stage, something that wouldn\u2019t have necessarily been true if the field was spread across two nights.\n\nWarren and Biden \u2014 the two candidates who will appear at the very center of the wide stage, CNN said Wednesday \u2014 did not meet in either of the first two rounds and didn't appear together until the third debate, when there was only one stage.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s ups and downs. I don\u2019t think the American people really wanted to see two nights,\u201d an aide to one of the campaigns in the debate, who was granted anonymity to speak freely, said. \u201cOne the other hand, 12 candidates on stage is pretty unwieldy. It\u2019ll be tougher for candidates not in the top two or three to get a word in.\u201d\n\nHowever, this may be the last time a stage will be this crowded. The DNC has raised the thresholds to qualify for the next debate in November. And while the new levels aren't expected to significantly cull the field, they could imperil a handful of candidates who qualified for this month's debate.\n\nA crowded 12-person debate stage \u2014 up from an already busy 10-person stage \u2014 could also change the incentives for the candidates on stage. More candidates means less speaking time all around, and past debate rules have encouraged conflict between the candidates.\n\nCandidates who are mentioned by other candidates in past debates have gotten time to respond, which encourages lower-tier candidates to take a swing at a candidate at the center of the stage, in hopes they can trigger an extended back-and-forth discussion. Moderators, too, have goaded candidates, asking pointed questions about specific front-runners\u2019 policies and history to other candidates. (Neither the DNC, nor the two media partners for the debate, CNN and The New York Times, has released the rules for the next debate yet.)\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re putting candidates in a position where they\u2019re going to be jockeying for attention and changing the incentives for some of the candidates, particularly for some of the lower-polling end of the spectrum, to try to get into the conversation,\u201d the aide said. \u201cFinding that balance on how you can get attention and more speaking while doing so in a way that\u2019s tactful is probably hard for some candidates.\u201d\n\nIt can also lead to candidates being caught by surprise by a broadside from someone else on stage. \u201cNormally you\u2019re really only focused on one or two other candidates, in terms of who you\u2019re looking to take down and whose looking to take down you,\u201d veteran GOP strategist Alex Conant said. Conant advised Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s (R-Fla.) 2016 presidential bid, when Rubio participated in the then-record-sized debate.\n\n\u201cGoing into a debate, every candidate has something they want to leave voters with. But with 12 people on stage you might not have a chance to say it,\u201d Conant said. \u201cDebate prep is really about: How do you pivot to your message regardless of what the question is?\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2a/8c/c3be81d840e48269823066c32d5d/191002-biden-warren-getty-773.jpg"}
