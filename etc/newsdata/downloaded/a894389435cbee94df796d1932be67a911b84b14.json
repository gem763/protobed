The business world needs to be better for her.", "language": "en", "text": "Sophia has her sights set on becoming an architect and someday hopes to run her own firm. She\u2019s being home-schooled, in part because D.C. public schools offer limited courses in entrepreneurship and at only three high schools \u2014 two of them alternative schools for at-risk students.\n\n\u201cI wanted Sophia to have a more real-world experience learning about business,\u201d said Shantel Collins, her mother, who is a graphics designer. \u201cI wanted her to learn how to solve problems, not just pick the right answer on a test sheet.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine Sophia realizing her dreams, given her talents and family support. She\u2019s coming of age when it\u2019s not unusual to see women-owned businesses in the city, which can be inspiring.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2016, women-owned businesses in Washington saw a growth rate of 51 percent, one of the fastest in the nation, according to a 2019 report by Beacon, a D.C.-based organization that works to connect and support women entrepreneurs.\n\nThe District is home to 68,236 small businesses, according to census data, with 27,000 owned by women. Black women own about 12,400; white women about 11,000.\n\nBut behind those numbers are indications of the formidable challenges that await women of color seeking careers in business.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThough Black and White women in D.C. have comparable numbers of businesses,\u201d the Beacon report said, \u201cthe differences in total receipts is alarming: with about 11,000 firms, White-women-owned businesses earn nearly $3 billion in receipts, while the approximately 12,000 Black-women-owned businesses earn $600 million in receipts. This gap only widens when factoring in other minority groups.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSimilar troubling patterns show up nationally in a 2018 American Express report of women-owned businesses. In 2007, the average revenue for women-of-color-owned businesses was $84,100; by 2018 it had dropped to $66,400. But outcomes were just the opposite for businesses owned by white women. In 2007, the average revenue for their businesses was $181,000; by 2018 it had jumped to $212,300.\n\nAnd a February report by the JPMorgan Chase Institute makes it clear that no matter the race of the woman, women-owned businesses start with revenue 34 percent lower than firms owned by men. The revenue growth for women doesn\u2019t narrow over time.\n\nAD\n\nSo if that is the burden all women must carry, imagine how much heavier the load is for women of color. They are experiencing not just sexism in a white-male-dominated world of business but racism, too.\n\nAD\n\nAt least the problem of racial disparity has been identified, and various groups of women entrepreneurs are working on remedies. Perhaps in two or three decades, or whenever Sophia decides to set up her architectural firm, the economic playing field will be a little less tilted.\n\nSophia\u2019s mother says she wants her daughter to learn to manage money and realize that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t grow on trees.\u201d And Sophia\u2019s learning fast, putting most of her business profits into savings, investing some and spending a little every now and then.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNot only do I want money \u2014 I want to learn how to make money,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked why she chose to sell candied apples, Sophia said, \u201cI saw one at a carnival when I was little, and it was pretty.\u201d\n\nSophia has a mentor \u2014 as all budding entrepreneurs should \u2014 who runs a coffeehouse in her Riggs Park neighborhood. Veronica Cooper, 68, is owner of Coffee Culture Too. She has a can-do attitude. When it comes to encountering obstacles, in business or life, she says, \u201cYou maneuver around them, or you go through them, and you get things done.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhen she was 13 growing up in Detroit, Cooper had her own business, as a seamstress, repairing and later making dresses. After attending the Pratt Institute of art and design in New York, she traveled the world as a fashion designer.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2005, she moved to Washington to be closer to her mother. She opened Culture Coffee Too in 2017 and took Sophia under her wing.\n\nOn some weekends, Sophia uses Cooper\u2019s business for a pop-up store to sell her treats. Cooper also gives her sewing lessons, which she sees as preparation for becoming an architect.\n\nCooper says she is aware of the economic burdens that sexism and racism can have. But, she says: \u201cYou just have to hang in there. You have to fight. Be ready for battle or stay out of the ring. You have to ask yourself, how badly do I want this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not excusing injustice or unfairness,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m saying deal with it. I\u2019ve been waking up black and female all of my life, and I go out and take care of business.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNot long ago, Sophia paid a visit to Bene Millinery and Bridal Supplies to meet shop owner Vanilla Powell Beane, who was celebrating her 100th birthday. One of the youngest entrepreneurs in the city had come to pay homage to one of the oldest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you,\u201d Sophia said, offering a handshake.\n\nThe hat maker\u2019s century-old hand embraced the candy maker\u2019s, the girl\u2019s fingers soft and nimble from texting. Beane recalled that when she was 10, her hands had calluses from chopping tobacco on a sharecropping farm where she grew up in Wilson, N.C.\n\nBeane moved to Washington in 1942 and spent the better part of the next 60 years creating hats and building a business.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDo you sew?\u201d she asked Sophia. \u201cI could use someone like you helping me make these hats.\u201d\n\nShe gave the girl enough material to try her hand at making a hat, called it homework and told her to come back when she had finished.\n\nAD\n\nBeane, who was born Sept. 13, 1919, grew up in an era of stark racial disparity and injustice. There were times she had been happy just to have a job, no matter how unequal the pay. Reflecting on her life, she paused and shook her head. \u201cHow did I get over?\u201d she asked, sounding amazed to have endured.\n\n\u201cGood lord,\u201d she said.\n\nBeane kept a poem at her shop that had been written and signed by Maya Angelou, called \u201cPhenomenal Woman.\u201d She suggested that Sophia read it sometimes. Words that encouraged black girls to be comfortable with who they were, appreciate how they looked and know that beauty comes from within.\n\nAD\n\nSophia was impressed.\n\nShe said of Beane: \u201cShe had this dream and stuck with it for all these years. I can see myself doing that.\u201d\n\nAnd with any luck, Sophia\u2019s dream will come with fewer challenges and equal pay.\n\nTo read previous columns, go to washingtonpost.com/milloy.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Women-owned businesses have been growing, but challenges remain \u2014 especially for women of color.", "authors": ["Courtland Milloy", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NviWAOzLLwb1krA9mWcweUCCf3M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/25JP6DXEK4I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
