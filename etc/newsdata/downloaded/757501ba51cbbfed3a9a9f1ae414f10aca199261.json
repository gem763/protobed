Giuliani is not invited on television to share his wisdom but to participate in spectacle. He is treated \u2014 and acts \u2014 as a pugilist and a sideshow, not an elder to be honored for his accomplishments or consulted for hard-won prudence. Though certainly possessed of his defenders among the president\u2019s allies and supporters, he is spending his late years awash in public disdain, more laughingstock than dignitary. His insistence that he is the hero, that he merits praise \u201cas someone who has devoted most of his life to straightening out government,\u201d reads to me as some recognition of this circumstance and a desperate plea for it to change.\n\nThis is not how old age should be.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bonnie Kristian", "Theweek.Com Articles Rudy-Giuliani-Challenge-Aging-Well"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
