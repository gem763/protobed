That fact is beyond doubt.\n\n\"But we don't just have a right to offer the people of Scotland a choice over their future. In the circumstances Scotland now faces, we have a duty to do so and that is what we intend to do.\"\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nShe went on: \"But let me be clear about this. The process by which we choose Scotland's future must be capable of actually achieving independence. It must allow majority support to be expressed clearly and unambiguously. It must be legal and it must have the recognition of the international community.\n\n\"Why? Because our job is not just to deliver a referendum. Conference, our job is to deliver independence.\n\n\"And my call is that the referendum must happen next year. And we are getting ready.\"\n\nDelegates took to their feet in a lengthy standing ovation at the announcement.\n\nThe first Scottish referendum, on 18 September 2014, rejected independence by 55% to 45%.\n\nThe timing of the first referendum was set through the Edinburgh Agreement, which set a date \"before the end of 2014\".\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nShe went on: \"By the new year we will have completed our legislative preparations. We are already working to update the independence prospectus.\n\n\"And I can confirm today that before the end of this year I will demand the transfer of power that puts the legality of that referendum beyond any doubt.\"\n\nThe First Minister will try to trigger a second referendum with something called a 'Section 30 order'.\n\nThis is a power under Section 30 of the 1998 Scotland Act.\n\nIt lets \"the Queen in Council\" take something the Scottish parliament doesn't currently control, and give the Scottish parliament control over it.\n\nMs Sturgeon went on to say an independent Scotland, as part of the European Union, would have a \"unique advantage\" which could make it a \"magnet for global investment\".\n\nWith a general election \"imminent\" Ms Sturgeon said her party would fight that campaign with a \"clear, simple and unambiguous\" message.\n\nThat will be: \"Vote SNP to demand independence and secure Scotland's right to choose.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon said: \"Some polls suggest that an election might result in a hung parliament.\n\n\"The SNP will never put the Tories into power.\n\n\"But I have a message for any Westminster party that wants SNP support.\n\n\"If you don't respect Scotland's right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing, don't even bother picking up the phone.\"\n\nThe First Minister said: \"We will be in the EU single market and the closest neighbour to our friends in the rest of the UK.\n\n\"A bridge between Europe and the UK, making our country a magnet for global investment.\n\n\"That's what I call the best of both worlds.\"", "description": "The Scottish First Minister told her party's conference she will have laid the legal groundwork for another IndyRef by the end of 2019", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Image", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20585606.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Scotlands-First-Minister-Nicola-Sturgeon-gestures-during-her-speech-at-the-SNP-autumn-conference-in.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
