But the Mystics had a 2-1 advantage in the series and led by as many as five points in the fourth quarter of Game 4. Now they\u2019ll enjoy home-court advantage in the winner-take-all game, thanks to their 26-8 regular season record and No. 1 seed.\n\nGame 5 is set for 8 p.m. Thursday at the Entertainment and Sports Arena.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
