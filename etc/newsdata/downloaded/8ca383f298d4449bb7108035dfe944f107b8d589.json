None of the three had won on the PGA Tour. Hubbard lost the lead with a bogey on the par-5 16th, while Harrington's big rally ended with a three-putt bogey on the 17th.\n\nGriffin's birdie on the 16th was his first since the eighth hole.

His birdie putt ran 6 feet by the hole, and he dropped his putter and raised both arms when it dropped for the win.\n\nHe finished at 14-under 274 and earned a two-year exemption, along with trips to the Masters and PGA Championship.\n\nEUROPEAN TOUR\n\nROME (AP) - Bernd Wiesberger closed with a 6-under 65 to win the Italian Open and move atop the Race to Dubai standings on the European Tour.\n\nLanto Griffin tees off on the second hole during the fourth round of the Houston Open golf tournament Sunday, Oct, 13, 2019, in Houston.
