There is now hope for a resolution to this conflict,\" she said.\n\n\"In Sudan, the military regime and the opposition have returned to the negotiating table. On the 17th of August, they released a joint draft of a new constitution intended to secure a peaceful transition to civil rule in the country. Prime Minister Abiy played a key role in the process that led to the agreement,\" Reiss-Andersen added.\n\nAs NPR's Eyder Peralta noted in December, \"Seemingly overnight, [Ahmed] opened up a democratic space \u2014 allowing foes, allies and regular Ethiopians a chance to speak their minds \u2014 after decades of authoritarian rule.\"\n\nSeveral names were considered top contenders for this year's prize, including Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong were also under consideration.\n\nThe selection committee consists of five people selected by Norway's parliament.\n\nSince 1901, there have been 100 Nobel Peace Prizes awarded to individuals and 24 have gone to organizations.\n\nThis week, 12 Nobel laureates have been named and 11 of them have gone to men. The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences will be awarded on Monday.", "description": "The Ethiopian leader received the award for his efforts to bring an end to 20 years of war with neighboring Eritrea.", "authors": ["Scott Neuman"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/11/gettyimages-1158934775_wide-64a91156bb9b9e6855d5db04d9d10470d082526d.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
