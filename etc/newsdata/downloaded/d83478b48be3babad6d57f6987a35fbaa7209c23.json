REUTERS/Mohamed al-Sayaghi\n\nU.N. investigators recommended that all states impose a ban on arms transfers to the warring parties to prevent them from being used to commit serious violations.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the continued supply of weapons to parties to the conflict is perpetuating the conflict and prolonging the suffering of the Yememi people,\u201d Melissa Parke, an expert on the independent U.N. panel, told a news conference.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are urging member states to no longer supply weapons to parties to the conflict,\u201d she said.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the main parties in the coalition fighting against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that controls Yemen\u2019s capital, are two of the biggest buyers of U.S., British and French weapons.\n\nThe experts compiled a secret list of suspected war criminals. Investigators found potential crimes on both sides, while highlighting the role Western countries play as backers of the Arab states and Iran plays in support of the Houthis.\n\nPanel chair Kamel Jendoubi declined to reveal details of the list of suspects, adding: \u201cWhat is sure is that we have gathered sufficient facts and sufficient testimonies that would allow to bring those individuals to justice at a later stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no clean hands in this combat, in this contest,\u201d panelist Charles Garraway said.\n\nThe report accused the anti-Houthi coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE of killing civilians in air strikes and deliberately denying them food in a country facing famine. The Houthis, for their part, have shelled cities, deployed child soldiers and used \u201csiege-like warfare\u201d, it said.\n\nNeither the Saudi government communications office nor UAE officials responded immediately to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nThe Houthis drove Yemen\u2019s government out of the capital Sanaa in 2014. The Saudi-led coalition of Sunni Muslim states intervened the following year to restore the ousted government, a conflict that has since killed tens of thousands of people.\n\nThe prospect of famine has created what the United Nations describes as the world\u2019s biggest humanitarian crisis, where 24 million people rely on aid.\n\nSECRET LIST\n\nThe U.N. report said its independent panel had sent a secret list to U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, identifying \u201cindividuals who may be responsible for international crimes\u201d.\n\nIts appendix lists more than 160 \u201cmain actors\u201d among Saudi, Emirati and Yemeni government and Houthi officials, although it said this was separate from the suspects list.\n\nRadhya Almutawakel, chair of independent Yemeni rights group Mwatana, welcomed the report\u2019s findings. \u201cIt sends a message to the parties to stop the war and that they will be held to account,\u201d she told Reuters.\n\nJohn Fisher of Human Rights Watch called on the U.N. Human Rights Council, which opens a three-week session on Monday, to strengthen the panel\u2019s mandate and provide \u201cincreased resources to preserve evidence, identify perpetrators and analyse command structures\u201d.\n\nThe report said: \u201cThe legality of arms transfers by France, the United Kingdom, the United States and other States remains questionable, and is the subject of various domestic court proceedings.\u201d\n\nIt found that a Joint Incidents Assessment Team set up by Saudi Arabia to review alleged coalition violations had failed to hold anyone accountable for any strike killing civilians, raising \u201cconcerns as to the impartiality of its investigations\u201d.\n\n\u201cOf one thing we are pretty sure - things are going wrong in the (coalition) targeting process,\u201d Garraway said.", "description": "The United States, Britain and France may be complicit in war crimes in Yemen by arming and providing intelligence and logistics support to a Saudi-led coalition that starves civilians as a war tactic, the United Nations said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425711544&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF820QF"}
