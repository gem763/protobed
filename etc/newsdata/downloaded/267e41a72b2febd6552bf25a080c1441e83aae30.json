(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nAfter spotting a woman\u2019s Elizabeth Warren bumper sticker, Joseph Schumacher pulled his car alongside hers and rolled down his window. He yelled at her, police said, gesturing toward his own bumper sticker: Trump 2020.\n\nThe two sniped back and forth Monday afternoon while driving along Eighth Street, one of the main drags in the northwestern Minnesota city of Moorhead. Then, authorities say, Schumacher pulled out a gun and waved it at the Warren supporter, who called police.\n\nSchumacher, of West Fargo, N.D., now faces charges of making terroristic threats, a felony, and having a loaded gun inside a vehicle without a permit, a misdemeanor.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speculate on what the suspect\u2019s intent when he did that was, but, obviously for the victim, it was a fearful situation,\u201d Moorhead police Capt. Deric Swenson told The Washington Post. \u201cSo that\u2019s why he\u2019s facing those charges.\u201d\n\n[Man who fatally shot former NFL back Joe McKnight found guilty of manslaughter]\n\nRoad rage episodes happen \u201cnow and then,\u201d the police captain said. But Swenson said couldn\u2019t remember another case where political differences were the cause. He said Schumacher and the woman appeared to have started the exchange \u201chaving fun with it.\u201d They continued sparring while driving about eight blocks before it escalated into Schumacher pulling a gun, he said.\n\nThe 27-year-old remained behind bars at the Clay County Jail on Tuesday, Swenson said.\n\nRead more:\n\nParents of teen killed in crash blamed on U.S. diplomat\u2019s wife call on Trump to intervene\n\nPresidents don\u2019t have \u2018limitless\u2019 immunity, and other takeaways from the Trump tax-return ruling\n\nTrump loves to tout his base.
