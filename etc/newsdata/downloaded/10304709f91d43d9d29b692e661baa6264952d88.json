But from the start, Mr. Trump made it abundantly clear that he wanted out of Afghanistan.\n\nAt one stage halfway through the yearlong negotiations, Mr. Trump stumbled during a Fox interview, incorrectly saying that the number of American troops in Afghanistan was 9,000 and not the 14,000 it was listed at. Many, including some Taliban officials taking part in the talks in Qatar, read that as confirmation that the American decision to draw down had already been made whether the Taliban offered concessions or not.\n\nMuch of the initial effort by American negotiators was trying to persuade the Taliban that the United States was truly committed to Afghanistan, while signaling that the insurgents should not try to wait out the Am ericans .\n\nAmerican military officials, though wary of leaving Afghanistan altogether, had signed off on the first stages of a troop drawdown in a draft peace agree ment that would have seen 5,400 American troops leave the country over about five months. The measure was put forward to show the Taliban that the Americans would abide by the proposed deal in return for the insurgent group reducing violence in Afghanistan, according to officials taking part in the negotiations.\n\nBut the peace talks colla psed last mont h when Mr. Trump pulled the plug on the deal his diplomats had finalized and initialed after a year of negotiations.\n\nAmerican officials have since quietly signaled that they are trying to keep the talks with the Taliban alive. Earlier this month, the chief negotiator for the United States, Zalmay Khalilzad, met informally with Taliban officials in Pakistan.\n\nDuring his visit, Mr. Esper also said a peace agreement was \u201cthe best way forward.\u201d\n\nThe current process of troop reduction outside of peace talks gives more control over the process to General Miller and the government of President Ashraf Ghani, which had criticized the United States for negotiating a troop withdrawal with the insurgents rather than with the country\u2019s elected government.", "description": "The reduction, which officials say could gradually drop the number of troops by several thousand, is happening even without any deal with the Taliban.", "authors": ["Thomas Gibbons-Neff", "Mujib Mashal"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/21/world/21afghan-withdrawal1/21afghan-withdrawal1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
