I\u2019m from Australia, where the Japanese dining landscape is mostly dried seabeds of sushi and tempura bound by rivers of teriyaki sauce. The truly alien encounters await in Japan\u2019s gastronomic world, from surreal sea creatures to pod-like akebi fruit.\n\nThere are 400 Japanese words just to describe food texture. Many are a charming onomatopoeia, like fuwa fuwa (fluffy) or mochi mochi (chewy). This, then, is my onomatopoeic eating journey.\n\nWarning: These foods might confound your taste buds and mess with your psyche.\n\nWith that obligatory message out of the way, like a lightweight Anthony Bourdain, I\u2019ll start with the mildly disconcerting and finish with the fully terrifying.\n\n1. Beta beta yokan\n\nI love pastries and buns. Too bad in Japan they\u2019re often pumped with anko (also called an) most commonly, an azuki (red bean) and sugar paste. From manju (steamed bread) to mochi (rice flour cakes), Japan abounds in anko stealth bombs disguised as dessert.\n\nYokan are bouncy anko and kanten (algae jelly) blocks. It\u2019s the specialty of Toraya, a wagashi (traditional sweets) empire founded in Kyoto circa the early 1500s and a purveyor to the Imperial Palace. You can buy yokan at Toraya department store outlets or caf\u00e9s across Japan.\n\nYokan is rich, dense and (as the Japanese call it) beta beta (cloyingly sticky). As with peanut butter, anko fans like to debate the merits of smooth versus chunky, but for this Westerner, legumes as candy are weird because I think of chili con carne. It\u2019s not unpleasant but won\u2019t replace Pocky as my go-to snack.\n\nClick here to read more.\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://gaijinpot.com/\n\n\u00a9 GaijinPot", "description": "I once thought natto (fermented soybeans) was Japan\u2019s worst culinary bogeyman, but much nastier, nightmarish foods exist in the archipelago to tempt foreign fates.
