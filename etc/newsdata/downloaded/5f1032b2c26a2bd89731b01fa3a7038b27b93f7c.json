Politico\u2019s Virginia Heffernan brings readers up to speed on a burgeoning literary genre in 2020, where Barack Obama and Joe Biden save the universe in one way or another. It\u2019s not actually new, but the presidential fanfic universe is expanding in, ahem, new and interesting ways:\n\nPast presidential fanfic masterworks\u2014like \u201cKim Jong Elmo vs Dick Cheney and George Bush featuring Lapis Lazuli\u201d\u2014might have been relegated to online speakeasies, but so great is the nostalgie d\u2019Obama that new books about Barry and Joe are bringing fanfic\u2019s nerdy tropes into the light of day in print. Parodist Andrew Shaffer has just added a new entry to his enjoyably ludicrous Obama-Biden series, which launched last year with Hope Never Dies and features the duo solving mysteries together. The second entry, published in July, is called, you guessed it, Hope Rides Again. Indie director Adam Reid\u2019s gonzo graphic confection, The Adventures of Barry & Joe, which styles Obama and Biden as time-traveling superheroes, was released this past spring. It is here to, if not to save the day, then at least demonstrate the life-changing magic of putting our heads under the covers and pretending it\u2019s 2015. I respect you if you refuse to look back and entertain fantasies that Obama and Biden might return to deliver the Republic from evil. Biden on the 2020 stump might wield Obama\u2019s name like a talisman to protect himself from criticism, but all sane voters know the Joe-Barack heyday is never coming back.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to take any of this too seriously, especially since we live in an era where political fanfic has firmly established itself as the choice escapist fare of true believers. Hence we have Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a Wonder Woman knockoff with questionable superpowers, or for that matter a ripped Donald Trump as the invincible protagonist of My Hero Magademia, complete with \u201cWALL MIGHT\u201d. (That sounds like a conditional \u2014 a wall might what?? \u2014 until you read the comic.) At least this is explicitly escapist, as opposed to the true believers attempting to explain every move of their heroes in real life as TOTES BRILLIANT IN EIGHT-DIMENSIONAL CHESS.\n\nThe two Shaffer books, Heffernan writes, take the form of Hardy Boys mysteries dedicated to \u201cpoignant nostalgia for libmerica.\u201d Shaffer, a parodist who also brought us The Day of the Donald in the summer of 2016, had Barry and Joe bust the opioid epidemic while solving the murder of an Amtrak conductor in the days after the 2016 election in the first book. The prequel-sequel Hope Rides Again, which came out in July, apparently explains that the pair was too busy solving another mystery in the last couple of years of the Obama presidency for Joe to get around to running for president in 2016. Even for fanfic, that\u2019s a pretty contrived vindication.\n\nBut it\u2019s the Adam Reid graphic novel extravaganza The Adventures of Barry & Joe1 that truly take us to the edge of the fanfic genre. This entry, subtitled Obama & Biden\u2019s Bromantic Battle for the Soul of America, stretches the idea of bromance to its breaking point. It\u2019s supposed to just be a friendship, but Reid manages to get both of them out of their clothes, Heffernan notes, under the watchful eye of \u2026 Samuel L. Jackson?\n\nBut, unaccountably, Reid still wants to see the former president and VP nekkid, so by panel No. 7 of the chapter called \u201cTrue Bromance,\u201d they\u2019re drawn in a locker room, preparing to participate in a time-travel experiment by stripping down to their briefs. By No. 9, we\u2019re to full-posterior nudity. Joe, so you know, has the dusty-rose busting-at-the-seams body of geezer strongman Jack LaLanne. Barry, while also shredded, is only somewhat slimmer. \u2026 Before Joe and Barack disappear into a time-travel vessel that looks like KitchenAid made it, Biden says, \u201cBarack, I want you to know \u2026 I wanna hug even though we\u2019re naked. Is that wrong?\u201d Barry: \u201cLet\u2019s not.\u201d Joe: \u201cI\u2019ll see you on the other side.\u201d\n\nAt first, it\u2019s easy to think this is parody, a skewering of adolescent wish-fulfillment fantasies by those who put political heroes on pedestals. Reading through the Amazon preview of Reid\u2019s book, it becomes apparent that it\u2019s not parody at all \u2013 it literally is the realization of their adolescent wish-fulfillment fantasies. That impulse explains the book\u2019s existence in printed form, in fact; Reid notes that his Kickstarter project attracted 1700 or so donors and made this \u201cbromantic battle\u201d into comic-book reality.\n\nWith that said, we could cluck our tongues all day at the goofiness of the Obama-Biden fanboys who produce this dreck, but we\u2019d have to acknowledge that it\u2019s only a few years before fanboys begin attempting to improve on My Hero Magademia. In the end, the whole comic-book superhero genre is based on perceived impotence (where superhuman powers are needed to cope with life), so perhaps we should be happy that Biden\u2019s fans think he needs time travel, Samuel L. Jackson, and Super Obama to prevail. They may just be right.\n\n1: Link included to let people know I wasn\u2019t making this up.", "description": "And \"the bromantic battle for the soul of America\"?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/barry-joe-fanfic.png"}
