In addition to Marco Asensio, who has a long-term knee problem, Nacho, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Lucas Vazquez are all doubtful for the trip to the Balearic Islanders.\n\nMallorca, meanwhile, will be glad of any advantage as they seek to escape the relegation zone, sitting third from bottom after returning to the top flight this season.\n\nDespite the multiple absentees, which leave Casemiro as the only first choice central midfielder available to coach Zinedine Zidane, Real top the table on 18 points. They are two points clear of nearest rivals Barcelona, who face a testing trip to Eibar earlier on Saturday.\n\nA victory for the Catalans would see them top the standings - at least temporarily - for the first time in what has been an indifferent start to their title defense.\n\nStar man Lionel Messi says they are conscious that their goal should be retaining their title.\n\n\"The Champions League is something special and we all want to win it, but we are conscious that La Liga is the most important,\" he said.\n\n\"We never forget about the Liga and the Copa because we are Barcelona and we always aim to win everything.\"\n\nThe Argentine is fit again after missing the start of the season and admits he needs to adapt as he gets older.\n\n\"It\u00b4s tough because in your head you\u00b4re fine and you think you\u00b4re still 25 and can do what you did back then. But your body tells you otherwise and there\u00b4s circumstances in which you need to take more care of yourself than before.\n\n\"It takes time and you have to prepare in a different way for both training and games.\"\n\nBarca will be without suspended duo Gerard Pique and Ousmane Dembele for the trip to the Basque country, where they were held to a 2-2 draw on their last visit in May.\n\nElsewhere, high-flying Granada host Osasuna on Friday, while Valencia travel to Atletico Madrid on Saturday.\n\nBottom of the table Leganes, who have yet to win this season, visit Getafe in a Madrid derby on Sunday.
