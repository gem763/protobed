They beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-4 in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, completing a dominant \u2014 if surprisingly dicey \u2014 sweep at a delirious ballpark whose denizens preferred not to, or simply couldn\u2019t, sit down. In a town with a baseball history that can best be described as complicated, the significance of that victory is multilayered.\n\nWhat matters, though, is just one thing: The Washington Nationals are going to the World Series.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTuesday night began with an explosion and ended with fingernails hanging onto the edge of a cliff. Cardinals starting pitcher Dakota Hudson recorded only one out and allowed five scorching hits before he was mercifully removed. When the first inning closed, the Nats held a 7-0 lead, and the home crowd of 43,976 bounced with jubilation.\n\nIn those moments, the pennant seemed clinched. Washington had never trailed in the series. Starting pitcher Patrick Corbin struck out seven of the first nine Cardinals he faced. This was a walkover, and the crowd sensed it.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Washington\u2019s baseball past is littered with calamities, and the Cardinals are one of the sport\u2019s proudest franchises. Sweeps aren\u2019t easy. Pennants aren\u2019t granted. By the fifth, St. Louis was within 7-4, and anticipation had turned to anxiety. There would be joy. But torment had to precede it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat, of course, fits with Washington baseball history. The heartache of previous Nationals\u2019 teams is fresh in the minds of so many who crowded in Tuesday night. But the angst for so many generations here comes not only in baseball failures but, worse, baseball\u2019s absence.\n\nWashington\u2019s most recent World Series appearance came in 1933 \u2014 in a different time, with a different team. Back then, the Senators of Goose Goslin, Heinie Manush and Joe Cronin were no match for the New York Giants, losing in five games. Eight years prior, Walter Johnson \u2014 forever the best player in Washington history, a Hall of Famer \u2014 pitched Game 7 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, seeking a third victory of the Series. But shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh booted one ball in the seventh, another in the eighth, and the Pirates came from behind to win.\n\nSo 1924 stands as the high-water mark in Washington baseball\u2019s development, the only World Series title, built not only on the right arm of Johnson, who came out of the bullpen for four shutout innings of relief in Game 7, but on the bad \u2014 or, in Washington\u2019s case, great \u2014 bounce of Bucky Harris\u2019s grounder to third, which scored two runs and allowed the Senators to come back and win the city\u2019s only baseball championship.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore this October, Harris\u2019s ball off a pebble could have been considered the most recent meaningful bounce in District history. It was 95 years ago.\n\nBut at least in those days, in the 1930s and on through the 1960s, there were bad hops \u2014 and lousy finishes \u2014 to lament. The Senators and their fans, a dwindling lot, suffered for decades, posting only four winning seasons between that 1933 World Series and 1960, when the original franchise packed up and headed to Minnesota to become the Twins.\n\nAn expansion outfit replaced it, and in 11 more seasons in town, only one winning season followed. You can\u2019t be a baseball fan in the District and not know the phrase, \u201cWashington: First in war, first in peace, last in the American League.\u201d For so many years, the Senators were a joke \u2014 until they left again, this time for Texas, and the nation\u2019s capital went 33 summers without baseball.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo for longtime Washingtonians, there has been a legitimate question as to what\u2019s worse: the jarring pain from kick-in-the-stomach postseason losses, or the dull ache of not having baseball at all?\n\nWhen Major League Baseball moved the Montreal Expos to Washington before the 2005 season, considering such questions seemed unrealistic. The re-branded Nationals were a mess of an organization that had been owned and run, nearly into the ground, by MLB itself. They made run-down RFK Stadium their temporary home. They finished in last place five of their first six years. Their farm system was threadbare, their scouting operation understaffed, the ballpark outdated. The playoffs seemed out of reach. Not in a specific season. In any season.\n\nIn 2006, MLB sold the franchise to the family of local real estate magnate Ted Lerner, and a slow rebuild began. The first winning season \u2014 and first National League East title \u2014 came in 2012, and October baseball somehow transformed into an expectation. Yet each appearance caused a wound, losses in the first round in \u201912, \u201914, \u201916, and \u201917. Those who care know the gruesome particulars. They also understand those events, when Nationals Park emptied in a near silent shuffle to Metro and beyond, make the accomplishment Tuesday night mean more.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted waters,\u201d said Mark Lerner, Ted\u2019s son and now the club\u2019s managing principal owner. \u201cThe Cardinals have been through it. The Dodgers have been through it. This is all new for everybody in this building.\u201d\n\nThat this club altered that trajectory borders on preposterous. The numbers that need to be known, that could be on T-shirts and tattoos around here, are 19-31 and 5/23. On May 23 \u2014 all together now \u2014 the New York Mets finished off a four-game sweep of the Nationals, who were on pace to lose 100 games. Only one team in the National League owned a worse record. The World Series? Please. A winning record seemed unlikely.\n\n\u201cObviously, I wasn\u2019t too happy,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cNobody was. I couldn\u2019t imagine what happened the rest of the season. I would have never believed where we are today. A turnaround like that only happens once in a blue moon, so I can\u2019t say I totally expected it. I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWho did? Maybe \u2014 maybe \u2014 the people inside the clubhouse, who understand that 50 games gone in a season means there are 112 left. Manager Dave Martinez, criticized in a disappointing 2018 as well as through May, remained outwardly buoyant. His approach, stated perhaps 112 more times, was to enter each day with a single goal: go 1-0 today.\n\n\u201cI want them to have fun,\u201d Martinez said Tuesday. \u201cI want them to be loose. Like I said before, we\u2019re not here solving the world\u2019s problems. We\u2019re here playing a baseball game.\u201d\n\nTo so many people in this town, though, this sweep of the Cardinals, followed by next week\u2019s World Series, will keep the world\u2019s problems at bay. Since its last World Series, Washington has been a laughingstock of a loser, a baseball wasteland, and a reclamation project.\n\nAD\n\nNow, the Nationals are National League champions. It\u2019s the kind of accomplishment that a team and its town can wake up to on Wednesday morning, look at the scars that have now healed, and feel pretty darned good about itself.\n\nAD\n\nRead more Nationals coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Team completes four-game sweep of St. Louis with a 7-4 win at joyous Nationals Park, sending the franchise to D.C.\u2019s first Fall Classic since 1933.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aK_1FBO5u1wAsOropP-sOvYGZ70=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XHACIFHPYII6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
