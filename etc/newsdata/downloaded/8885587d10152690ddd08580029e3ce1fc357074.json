It\u2019s a loud noise, and it can be embarrassing.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m likely to be hiccupping till my grave but it\u2019s become part of me now.\u201d\n\nThe longest period of hiccupping on record is 68 years, according to The British Society of Gastroenterology.\n\nLisa\u2019s case is considered rare. The involuntary contraction of her diaphragm now happens most when she\u2019s comfortable and relaxed, she says.\n\n\u201cFor everyone who knows me know, it\u2019s just a way of life, just who I am,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI can hiccup in the middle of a conversation, and it can be loud.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve grown used to it.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when I\u2019d feel quite embarrassed about it, and would put off going out in public, but now I just get on with it.\n\n\u201cFor my daughters, I\u2019ve hiccupped their entire lives so it doesn\u2019t bother them.\n\n\u201cIt can wake me up in the night, and sometimes my husband too, but it\u2019s only a minor inconvenience.\n\n\u201cKnowing what happened to me during my pregnancy for no reason, I\u2019m lucky.\n\n\u201cIt could have been a lot worse.\u201d\n\nSource: Magazine Features", "description": "A mom of two who started hiccupping when she was pregnant has revealed she still hasn\u2019t stopped \u2013 12 years later!", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9520/947841273c47404e9be7780bb9dfa11a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
