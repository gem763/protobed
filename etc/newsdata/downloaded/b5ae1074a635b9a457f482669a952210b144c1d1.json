Usually, they don't offer anything concrete \u2013 but can give an important indication of the kind of theme that Apple is aiming for in the new products or the event more generally.", "description": "Apple has invited the world to the launch of the new iPhone \u2013 and might have given them a big clue about what they're about to see.
