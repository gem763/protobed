Unsurprisingly, the campaign\u2019s director of communications, Tim Murtaugh, has a different take. \u201cWe have no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted,\u201d he said in a public statement Friday.\n\nThe group of hackers, which Microsoft has dubbed Phosphorus, made more than 2,700 attempts in a 30-day period between August and September to identify email accounts linked to Trump\u2019s campaign as well as those of current and former government officials and journalists. According to the company\u2019s blog post:\n\nFour accounts were compromised as a result of these attempts; these four accounts were not associated with the U.S. presidential campaign or current and former U.S. government officials.\n\nThree Republicans and 19 Democrats have announced plans to run in the 2020 election so far. According to Reuters\u2019 report, Trump is the only major contender whose official campaign site is linked to Microsoft\u2019s cloud email service.\n\nMicrosoft described the hackers\u2019 methods as \u201cnot technically sophisticated,\u201d though the attack was \u201chighly motivated\u201d and used \u201ca significant amount of personal information\u201d Phosphorus gathered on its targets via research and hacking secondary, linked email accounts. They then used this intel to attempt gaming password reset or account recovery features in order to break into a target\u2019s Microsoft account.\n\nPerhaps not uncoincidentally, the attack\u2019s timing corresponds with Trump announcing a new round of U.S. sanctions against Iran that\u2019s put significant pressure on the country\u2019s banks and oil trade. Maybe now the president regrets describing them in his typical overblown language as \u201cthe highest sanctions ever imposed on a country,\u201d per Reuters. (Eh, probably not.) As of yet, the Iranian government has not issued any kind of official public response to Microsoft\u2019s statement or subsequent reports about the hacking.\n\nApparently Iran\u2019s not the only one reportedly trying to rig the 2020 election this soon into the race either. Intelligence officials say Russia and North Korea have also launched cyberattacks targeting organisations that work with presidential candidates, the New York Times reported. Oren Falkowitz, the chief executive of a cybersecurity company called Area 1, told the Times, \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen attacks on several campaigns and believe the volume and intensity of these attacks will only increase as the election cycle advances toward Election Day.\u201d\n\nNow, say you\u2019re a politician up for re-election in the next 13 months who wants to know, for a friend of course, how to help protect your account. Two-factor authentification, while not fool-proof, is the way to go according to Microsoft\u2019s recommendation. Though instead of using potentially insecure SMS messages to deliver the authentification code, opt for a physical security key or authentification app like Authy or Google Authenticator. Case and point, Microsoft said part of Phosphorus cyberattack involved gathering the phone number of targets and using them to authenticate password resets. Microsoft\u2019s security service AccountGuard is also an option for eligible users.\n\nAs much as I hoped to never experience this particular case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, at the same time it\u2019s hardly a shock. President Trump has repeatedly given foreign entities his personal blessing to interfere in U.S. elections, and even with 13 months left before the next election, they\u2019re already responding to the invitation.", "description": "Government-backed Iranian hackers reportedly attempted to crack President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign website Friday, reminiscent of Russian cyber interference in the 2016 election because I guess we\u2019re just stuck in the Groundhog Day of American politics at this point....", "authors": ["Cheryl Eddy", "Jason Torchinsky"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/ertlrnxluvbf7ecqpxkt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
