Apple is banking on the idea that they can attract a higher level of producers and films by first making a theatrical release. This can certainly provide another revenue stream for Apple as well.\n\nIn addition, the theatrical release can broaden the market for Apple TV+. A receptive audience that could want to see the film again makes for potential subscribers for the fledgling streaming service. The exposure in a theater to a broad audience can also create consumer base to stream the same release at a later date via Apple TV+.\n\nAccording to Journal's report, Apple\u2019s first theater release will be Bill Murray\u2019s \u201cOn the Rocks\u201d in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple TV+ will debut in November. A subscription will cost $4.99 a month as the service looks to compete with industry giants such as Netflix and Amazon. In addition, a bevy of new competitors, including Disney+, are creating a crowded marketplace in a streaming war that doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing down.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Apple TV+ is going at things a bit differently, with their feature-length films first going to theaters before they stream.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/movie-theatre-Apple-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
