The United Nations is sending a team to investigate allegations of abuse.\n\nThe national human rights institute INDH said 584 people have been injured and 2,410 detained during the protests.\n\nHundreds of volunteers on Sunday joined in a huge clean-up operation in Santiago, washing down or painting walls that had been scrawled with graffiti and clearing up broken glass and the remnants of burned-out barricades.\n\nThe street movement still lacks recognizable leaders, though, and was mostly roused through social media, which analysts say makes it harder for the government to negotiate any resolution.\n\nThere were fears that continuing protests could put at risk the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) trade summit in Santiago from November 16-17, but the government said on Thursday it would go ahead.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are among those expected to attend the APEC meeting.", "description": "Santiago (AFP) \u2013 Embattled Chilean President Sebastian Pinera on Sunday announced a state of emergency that has lasted more than a week amid mass", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/ce9ef0_chile-president-sebastian-pinera-has-rolled-state-emergency-announced-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
