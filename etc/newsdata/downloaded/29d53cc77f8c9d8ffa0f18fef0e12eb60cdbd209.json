For those who choose to go with the injectable, there are two options.\n\nThe first is a trivalent vaccine, which protects against two influenza A strains, H1N1 and H3N2, and one influenza B strain.\n\nThe second option, the quadrivalent flu vaccine, protects against the same strains as the trivalent vaccine, as well as an extra influenza B virus.\n\nOfficials from the World Health Organization choose the strains for the vaccine that it believes will be the most common for the flu season.\n\n'Every year we have to design and produce a new vaccine to match the most common strains of that year,' co-senior author Dr Ali Ellebedy, an assistant professor of pathology and immunology at Washington University, told DailyMail.com\n\n'But if we had one vaccine that protected against all strains, we could actually be able to say, even if we didn't predict right, that we have a universal vaccine.'\n\nThe antibody, IG01, was discovered in the blood of patient hospitalized with the flu at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St Louis in winter 2017.\n\nDr Ellebedy noticed the blood sample didn't just contain antibodies fighting hemagglutinin, the main protein found on the surface of the influenza viruses, but three other antibodies targeting unknowns.\n\nHis colleague at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City tested the sample and found that IG01 blocked proteins across all flu viruses.\n\nThis was new because antibodies typically fight against one flu subtype, such as H1N1, but not across all subtypes.\n\nFor the study, published in the journal Science, the team gave mice given a lethal doses of the virus.\n\nAll three antibodies were effective against many strains, but IG01 protected against all 12 strains tested, including all three groups of human flu virus, and nonhuman strains, like avian which is lethal in humans.\n\n'We were surprised by how broad [the antibody] can protect,' said Dr Ellebedy.\n\n'Even though they got sick, we were able to save the mice. And it worked even when we gave them the antibody three days after infection.'\n\nHe compared this to Tamiflu, which is currently the most widely used drug for severe flu infection.\n\nTamiflu must be administered with 24 hours of flu symptoms so, theoretically, the antibody could be used when it it's too late to use Tamiflu.\n\nSo how does the antibody work?\n\nIG01 attacks neuraminidase, a protein also found on the surface of the virus that helps it replicate throughout the body.\n\nThe antibodies have loops hat slide in between the active sites of neuraminidase similar to gears fitting in place.\n\nThis prevents neuraminidase from sending out new virus particles and allowing the virus to make copies.\n\n'We are in a time where we are desperately looking for a universal vaccine,' said Dr Ellebedy.\n\n'We know where [the antibody] attacks and that allows us to tailor the vaccine to be able to optimally induce that particular antibody. We don't think the current vaccines are doing that.'", "description": "A new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis has found an antibody that attacks a protein found on the surface of a flu virus and prevents it from copying.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/17/20142056-0-image-a-9_1571934533176.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
