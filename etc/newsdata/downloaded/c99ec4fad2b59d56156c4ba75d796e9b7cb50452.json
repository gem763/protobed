In the first post, Cox shares a glammed up photo of herself with a big broad smile. In the second, she shares a sexy video of herself posing in a one piece with a jacket covering her sleek body.\n\n\"Single lady here,\" the Emmy nominee captioned the video. \"It's ok to slide into my DM's gentlemen. Don't be scared. Just be respectful. Los Angeles area preferred. Talk soon.\"\n\nShe then added the hashtag, \"TransIsBeautiful.\"\n\nAlthough some might deem the actress as bold to open up her DMs to the world, many fans were supportive of Cox's efforts.\n\n\"I need to step up my game and try this too,\" wrote one fan.\n\n\"Wow. What a whole queen. I love,\" beamed another.\n\n\"Rip to your dm inbox,\" joked another. \"You\u2019re beautiful.\"\n\nCox has yet to reveal if she's received any worthy offers.", "description": "Laverne Cox is now letting the world know that she's single and ready to mingle.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/laverne-cox-gty-jt-191001_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
