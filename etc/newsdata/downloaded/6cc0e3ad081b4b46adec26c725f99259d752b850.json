The main card streams on DAZN following prelims on MMA Junkie.\n\n(Click here to open a PDF of the staff picks grid in a separate window.)\n\nIn the headliner, welterweight champion Rory MacDonald (21-5-1 MMA, 3-1-1 BMMA) puts hits title on the line in a rematch against Douglas Lima (31-7 MMA, 13-3 BMMA), the man he took the belt from in early 2018. The fight doubles as the final of Bellator\u2019s welterweight grand prix tournament, and the winner gets a $1 million bonus. Although he\u2019s the champion, the oddsmakers have made MacDonald the underdog. Lima is a favorite of around -160, and our 13 MMA Junkie editors, writers, radio hosts and videographers are taking him at a heavy 11-2 clip.\n\nIn the co-main event, Saad Awad (23-12 MMA, 11-9 BMMA) steps up on short notice to take on Paul Daley (41-17-2 MMA, 7-4 BMMA) in a welterweight fight. Daley is a heavy 4-1 favorite, and he\u2019s the pick of 11 of our 13 staff members.\n\nThere are two unanimous picks on the main card. In the first, Patrick Mix (11-0 MMA, 1-0 BMMA) will try to stay unbeaten in a bantamweight fight against promotional newcomer Isaiah Chapman (9-3 MMA, 0-0 BMMA). Mix is a 6-1 favorite.\n\nThe other unanimous pick belongs to Nick Newell (16-2 MMA, 1-0 BMMA), who fights in front of his home fans in Connecticut again. He\u2019s more than a 6-1 favorite over Manny Muro (10-6 MMA, 1-0 BMMA) in their 160-pound catchweight fight.\n\nAnd to open the main card, Robin van Roosmalen (2-0 MMA, 0-0 BMMA) makes his Bellator debut and is a heavy 12-1 pick against Cris Lencioni (5-2 MMA, 2-2 BMMA) in their lightweight fight.\n\nIn the MMA Junkie reader consensus picks, Lima (53%), Daley (81 percent), Mix (91 percent), Newell (90 percent) and Van Roosmalen (62 percent) are the choices.\n\nCheck out all the picks above.\n\nGallery Photos: Rory MacDonald through the years view 36 images", "description": "Check out our staff members' picks for the Bellator 232 main card in Connecticut, featuring Rory MacDonald vs. Douglas Lima.", "authors": ["Matt Erickson", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Mmajunkie Staff", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bellator-232-staff-picks.jpg?w=640&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
