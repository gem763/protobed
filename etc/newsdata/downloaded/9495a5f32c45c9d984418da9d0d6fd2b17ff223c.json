Jennifer Aniston gets featured in the new issue of InStyle Magazine, and one of the shots looks a bit heavy on the spray-tan treatment. NBC News wonders whether Aniston might be considered guilty of a little ethnic appropriation:\n\nIn fact, NBC references Dolezal as the comparison made by several critics:\n\nIn the image \u2014 in which Aniston is wearing a black DKNY bra, a Lalaounis necklace and Elizabeth Locke, John Hardy and Reinstein Ross bracelets \u2014 the actress, who discussed with the magazine how it felt to turn 50 earlier this year, looked airbrushed and dark, many social media users were quick to note. Much of the criticism seemed to be aimed firmly at the magazine. Some compared her complexion to that of Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who gained national attention in 2015 for masquerading as black while serving as a local NAACP leader. \u201cI get that these covers are supposed to be channeling the glamour of yesteryear but that \u2018glamour\u2019 routinely marginalized women of color for white women (whether made tan or otherwise),\u201d Instagram user Patricia Birch, commented on the InStyle photo. \u201cSeeing Jennifer Aniston several shades darker than normal reminds me of that legacy. In 2019, if you want a brown skinned woman on your cover, put a brown-skinned woman on your cover.\u201d\n\nCall me crazy, but the magazine may have just wanted Aniston on its cover, not a skin tone. That assumption is backed up by InStyle\u2019s Instagram feed, which features several different looks for Aniston as cover shots for the issue. Others have varying degrees of tan, and perhaps also of airbrushing, but the tan isn\u2019t the feature \u2014 it\u2019s the 50-year-old Aniston and how she exemplifies \u201cBeauty,\u201d the theme of the issue.\n\nTossing a Dolezal reference into the mix is grossly dishonest. Dolezal didn\u2019t just show up after an overdone bronzing session \u2014 she actively defrauded people into believing she was an African-American woman. (And she\u2019s still at it, too.) Aniston\u2019s not doing anything except being herself, and InStyle isn\u2019t featuring her to feed stereotypes. In fact, they\u2019re trying to contradict the stereotype that women in their fifties can\u2019t exemplify beauty in many different ways.\n\nGive Aniston a break, give InStyle a break, and in fact give us all a break. It\u2019s a fashion shoot, not a conspiracy. It\u2019s silly beyond belief for a national news outlet to cover this rather than, say, a leading presidential candidate in his mid-70s bleeding in his eyeball on national television. Of course, when you\u2019re Friends with Democrats, those decisions are more explicable. We\u2019ll be there for you when the ratings are poor \u2026.", "description": "A Tale of Two Rachels?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/aniston-instyle.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
