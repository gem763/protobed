The event organized by research and advisory firm Gartner Inc. runs through Wednesday.\n\nFor the CIO, the possibility of a downturn can present an existential challenge. It can take years for digital transformation efforts to show returns. What happens if the economy hits a bump right in the middle of it? Such efforts involve not only investing in new technologies including artificial intelligence, but also adopting new processes and training models to take advantage of new capabilities.\n\nLarge corporations are spending less on technology, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. survey of tech sellers found, with demand declining sharply between June and September, Barron\u2019s reported last week. A Morgan Stanley survey of 100 chief information officers detected similar caution around spending.\n\nSigns of an economic slowdown are among three forces creating uncertainty for CIOs, according to the Gartner keynote, along with increased government activity in taxes, tariffs and tech regulations including data sovereignty, as well as encroachment by big digital companies.\n\n\u201cGlobally, many economists and CFOs believe we are heading towards another set of economic downturns,\u201d Val Sribar, a Gartner senior vice president, said in the keynote. \u201cIf they\u2019re right...how would you respond?\u201d\n\nThe answer, according to Gartner and IT executives interviewed here, is for CIOs to prepare their organizations for uncertainty, pushing ahead with digital initiatives while remaining fast and flexible enough to adjust to major changes in the direction of the economy or the marketplace, which Gartner calls \u201cturns.\u201d\n\nIn such situations, CIOs often must perform two opposing actions at once, just as race-car drivers must learn to accelerate and brake around the same time, Mr. Sribar said. For example, when the economy slows, CIOs must cut costs and invest at the same time, he added: \u201cYou have to analyze and execute, cut and grow.\u201d\n\nAs crude-oil prices were crashing several years ago. Royal Dutch Shell PLC executed a pivot, slowing down Arctic exploration efforts. The company then bought a power utility and invested in electric charge points. \u201cShell cut and invested in growth and innovation. Through the turn, they braked and accelerated,\u201d Mr. Sribar said.\n\nConference attendees pointed to technologies that could help companies weather a downturn.\n\nArtificial intelligence in call centers could help reduce labor costs while helping customers get answers to questions more quickly, Don Schuerman, chief technology officer at Cambridge, Mass.-based Pegasystems Inc., said in an interview. The company sells software that lets developers build and deploy applications with minimal coding.\n\nSome CIOs are closer than others to the turns.\n\nJulio Pivaral, corporate digital transformation manager at Corporaci\u00f3n Multi Inversiones.

It owns a 40% stake in Madrid-based Telef\u00f3nica SA \u2019s business in Central America, as well as Pollo Campero, a fast-food chain.\n\nSlowing business at CMI reflects economic conditions in the U.S., as well as economic, social and political problems in some of its key markets in Latin America, including Nicaragua and Honduras, Mr. Pivaral said in an interview.\n\nCMI is responding to the slowdown by making cuts in some areas while investing in technology that will support longer-term growth. \u201cFirst, we automated steps that were on the traditional side, rather than trying to explore and create new challenges for us. It is a challenge for a lot of companies in Latin America,\u201d Mr. Pivaral said. Now, he said, \u201cwe look into technology, to be more efficient and to be more close with the customer.\u201d\n\n\u2014Sara Castellanos and Steven Rosenbush contributed to this article.", "description": "Chief information officers are finding their costly digital-modernization plans challenged by the possibility of a global downturn, which many economists predict could happen within the next few years.", "authors": ["Tom Loftus", "Thomas.Loftus Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FG634_gartne_SOC_20191021175521.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
