The trailers for Spy, The Heat and A Simple Favour, for example, paint pictures quite different from the finished movies. Often, you leave the cinema feeling as if you have been pleasantly fooled.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly true with Last Christmas, which the director is sitting down to talk about in early September, and which appears, based on its teaser, to be a mushy festive romcom. Naturally, it doesn\u2019t quite go where you would expect it to, which of course means we can\u2019t really talk about the film we are here to talk about. \u201cExactly,\u201d he says, smiling. He is wearing, as is his custom, an impossibly dapper three-piece suit, and he has a sweetly nervous cough/chuckle that ripples up as he speaks. \u201cA lot of the movies I do just happen to have something like that in it. But I like people being surprised.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Last Christmas\n\nLast Christmas, very loosely inspired by the music of George Michael and Wham!, stars Emilia Clarke as a woman recovering from a life-threatening illness and whose day-to-day existence is a boozy, reckless mess. It turns out that Daenerys Targaryen is an excellent comic actor. \u201cIsn\u2019t it crazy?\u201d Feig says. A huge Game of Thrones fan, he summoned her for a meeting. \u201cI was expecting her to be very Daenerys, you know, proper: \u2018How do you do?\u2019 She comes in, and she\u2019s just funny, goofy and effervescent. I equate her in this movie to when Meg Ryan was in When Harry Met Sally. The whole country just goes: we\u2019re in love with you.\u201d\n\nThe film is also Feig\u2019s love letter to London, where he has been living for the past year, even if it takes some geographical liberties: \u201cThey walk from the Embankment to Ally Pally [Alexandra Palace, which is several miles away]. Then they run out of Ally Pally on to the Strand! I have great guilt about that.\u201d He loves London so much that he and his wife are making plans to move here. He got involved with the film when he went for a walk with Emma Thompson on Hampstead Heath to talk about directing Mindy Kaling\u2019s Late Night, in which Thompson starred, but the timings didn\u2019t work out. However, a friendship was born. \u201cI was in the process of signing on to do a different film somewhere else, and into my inbox popped up this email from Emma, titled The Script What I Wrote, in good old Morecambe-and-Wise tradition.\u201d He always gets nervous when friends send him scripts. \u201cThe best people in the world will send me a script sometimes and you\u2019re just like: \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 But I read this and was completely out of my mind, and so impressed by it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paul Feig \u2026 \u2018Like it or not, London, you do Christmas amazingly well.\u2019 Photograph: Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP\n\nThis is his second Christmas movie. The first, Unaccompanied Minors, came out in 2006, but was a flop. What did he learn from it? \u201cApparently nothing,\u201d he laughs, \u201cbecause I did another Christmas film.\u201d The script, by Thompson and Bryony Kimmings, and the prospect of being in London in December tempted him back. \u201cLike it or not, London, you do Christmas amazingly well.\u201d Also, its seasonal setting means it is guaranteed to come out for Christmas, and the release won\u2019t get bumped. \u201cI\u2019m just desperate for people to see my movies,\u201d he says. Is he really worried they won\u2019t? \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cEvery new movie is a chance to fail.\u201d\n\nFeig\u2019s film career came off the back of a hugely successful one in television. He created the cult teen series Freaks and Geeks, produced by Judd Apatow, and he seems to have directed at least a few episodes of the greatest shows from the past two decades: Mad Men, 30 Rock, The Office, Parks and Recreation. But film was a slow starter. \u201cI had done two unsuccessful movies, one being the first Christmas movie. That really stuck me in movie jail. It lost money for the studio.\u201d Just before that one came out, he had been invited to the table read of a script that would become Bridesmaids. \u201cI remember going: \u2018Oh my God, this is what I want to do \u2013 a movie filled with all these funny women.\u2019 Then it fell away for three years. I would call Judd occasionally, and be like: \u2018Is that movie around?\u2019 And he\u2019d say: \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna go.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bridesmaids \u2026 \u2018Making it was terrifying.\u2019 Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar\n\nFeig found himself in a funk, which became apparent when he was directing an internet campaign for a department store. \u201cIt was a fun job, but one of the people I was directing was Donald Trump.\u201d He laughs, awkwardly. \u201cIt was so unnerving, and he was unnerving. He was actually a fan of The Office, so he was like: \u2018Hey, that\u2019s the guy who did The Office.\u2019 But he had such a weird energy about him. I remember being back at my hotel room and thinking: \u2018I\u2019m so far away from doing what I want to do.\u2019\u201d Then the phone rang. \u201cI got a call from my agent going, hey, I think the wedding movie is gonna go.\u201d\n\nBridesmaids transformed his career. \u201cBut making it was terrifying. I always called it strike three, because if this one bombs, I\u2019m dead.\u201d He says there was additional pressure on it as a funny film written by and about women. \u201cIt shows how crazy and terrible the town can be, because really, they\u2019re like, before we do other movies with women, let\u2019s see how this one does. Would they ever say that when they\u2019re making The Hangover? Like, all right, if this men-driven movie works, we can make more of these?\u201d\n\nFeig has always related to women, and since Bridesmaids, all his films have had female leads. They\u2019re usually about women as outsiders; not quite managing to fit in where they are supposed to. \u201cI was an only child. I grew up next to a family of eight kids, six of whom were girls. I liked the humour of joking around with my female friends because male humour devolves, eventually, into homophobia, punching and name-calling. I\u2019d rather just have goofy fun.\u201d Later, when he was acting and directing, he was frustrated with what he was seeing on screen. \u201cI had [female] friends who were actors and comedians, and they would show up in movies and I\u2019d be, like: \u2018Oh yay, they\u2019re going to be funny. And, what, they\u2019re not funny?\u2019 I love School of Rock, but I remember thinking: \u2018Sarah Silverman is one of the funniest people on the planet. Why is she just being this mean girlfriend who\u2019s not funny?\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ghostbusters \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m very proud of the movie.\u2019 Photograph: Allstar/Sony Pictures\n\nAfter Bridesmaids, he was sent scripts in a similar vein, but he has hopped around genres with joyful promiscuity: thriller, action, spy heist, buddy-cop movie. On the day we meet, it is announced that he will direct a classic monster movie called Dark Army, but there are more still that he wants to try. \u201cWell, a musical, first and foremost. I want to do a big sci-fi epic. But not a pre-existing franchise.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Feig found himself at the centre of an internet storm, when his all-female Ghostbusters reboot unwittingly poked the hornet\u2019s nest of online misogynistic trolls. Is that why he wouldn\u2019t go for anything that already exists? \u201cA little bit, yeah,\u201d he says, his nervous cough/laugh returning. \u201cWhat is weird is when you come into something that brings a set of rules that are unbreakable because, as a storyteller, you\u2019re, like, why can\u2019t I break that? Can\u2019t I have fun with that?\u201d That\u2019s why he did the reboot. \u201cFor better or worse. I mean, we\u2019ll find out when Jason\u2019s movie [Reitman, who is making a Ghostbusters sequel] comes out. If that goes through the roof, I\u2019ll go: \u2018Sure, I guess I made a mistake doing a reboot.\u2019 But I will never apologise for it because I\u2019m very proud of the movie.\u201d\n\nIs Emilia Clarke about to fall in love with a ghost in Last Christmas? Read more\n\nHe is writing Dark Army at the moment. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are going to be websites that get completely up in arms about it, but I\u2019m at a point now where I don\u2019t care. I used to care, and Ghostbusters was a really cathartic, terrible thing to go through, but it was cathartic.\u201d He used to think everybody on the internet had to like him. Now, he cares a lot less. \u201cYou go: \u2018It\u2019s just the internet.\u2019 I love all the amazing people I\u2019ve connected with over the years on the internet, but then the ones that hate you, you\u2019re like: \u2018I can\u2019t do anything about you.\u2019\u201d\n\nFeig is not one for sequels. There is, as yet, no Bridesmaids II, no The Heat II, no Spy II. In an age of TV classics being rebooted, I ask if he would ever consider bringing the much-loved Freaks and Geeks back. \u201cI get asked all the time to do it. I\u2019m very scared of sequels or continuations of things because they\u2019re very easy to screw up. James Brown is my inspiration: he says hit it and quit it.\u201d\n\nThat said, he would like to make another Spy. Then he surprises me. \u201cAnd I would actually make another Ghostbusters, if anybody ever wanted it, because I loved that world. I was like a kid in a candy store.\u201d I tell him I would love to see it. \u201cWell, some day,\u201d he laughs. \u201cProbably not. But thank you.\u201d\n\nLast Christmas is released on 15 November", "description": "The director adores working with women \u2013 but did the all-female Ghostbusters furore change that?
