NBN Co and the federal government reject this argument.\n\nMr Mullen went on to complain about the cost of reselling the NBN, saying the high wholesale price was unprofitable and causing companies to lose money. He said this meant most NBN retailers would be forced to leave the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said it was also pushing telcos to develop NBN bypass products such as fixed wireless over 4G and 5G mobile networks.\n\n\"Ironically, it is actually becoming in the interests of those competitors that are embracing these new technologies that NBN\u2019s prices remain high, so the alternative technologies become more attractive,\" he said.\n\n\"The bottom line of this is that Australia already has some of the highest wholesale broadband pricing in the world, and if this trend continues, over time most resellers of the NBN will withdraw or go broke.\"\n\nMr Mullen defended company director and former AMP chief executive Craig Dunn, calling him \"one of the best public company directors in the country\". He urged shareholders to vote in favour of his re-election. Mr Dunn's association with the scandal ridden wealth company have led to calls for him to be sacked as director.\n\n\"We are aware that there has been commentary about Craig\u2019s association with AMP where he was CEO more than six years ago. However, it is important to note that at no time has Craig ever been accused of anything improper himself,\" Mr Mullen said.\n\nMr Mullen said Telstra was currently going through its \"greatest transformation [it has] has ever undertaken\" in its T22 plan.\n\nHe said the world of telco monopolies had \"gone forever\". \"Our industry today is exploding into a world of cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, IoT [Internet of things], autonomous vehicles, big data, drones, satellite technologies, and more,\" he said.\n\n\"This is the new technological world and the old world is not coming back. And while we may not like it, the days of Telstra\u2019s high legacy margins and 100 per cent dividend payout ratio are not coming back either.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Mullen defended chief executive Andy Penn's remuneration package, on which shareholders will also vote.\n\nOutside the convention centre on Tuesday morning, trade unionists were handing out leaflets calling on shareholders to vote down the remuneration report.\n\nCEPU Communications Union National president Shane Murphy said shareholders should send a message that \"it is outrageous that the Telstra CEO\u2019s salary continues to rise exorbitantly despite the company a declining share price, slashed dividends and major job losses\". As part of the T22 plan, Telstra is cutting a net of 8000 jobs.\n\nAhead of the vote on Tuesday morning, sources were confident they would go the Telstra board's way.", "description": "Telstra chairman John Mullen has slammed NBN Co's aggressive move into the enterprise market as a 'waste of collective resources'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_707%2C$y_182/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2e836d23c545d41b156c68d5cbc78fd2755383e0", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
