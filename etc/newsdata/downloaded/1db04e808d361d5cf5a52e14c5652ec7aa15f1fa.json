Compliance issues and regulatory delays in Canada, have also weighed on Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB). CRON stock, though, has fared the best of that bunch.\n\nCRON Stock Continues to Lag Due to Several Headwinds More\n\nYet, despite the problems, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a faster-growing industry than cannabis. According to recent research, the global market size is expected to reach $66.3 billion by the end of 2025, though these estimates vary widely.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut Wall Street still has mixed reactions when it comes to Cronos Group stock. Out of the 14 analysts reviewing the stock, eight have given it a hold rating. Here are a few reasons why analysts aren\u2019t more bullish about CRON stock.\n\nCronos Delivered Mixed Q2 Results\n\nCRON stock hit a new 52-week low in early August, thanks in part to a mixed earnings report. Initially, the company\u2019s shares rose due to better-than-expected sales. But Cronos Group also saw its operating losses widen.\n\nAnd on the earnings call, company executives said they expect these losses to increase during the second half of the year. This is due to Cronos\u2019 investments in sales and marketing and other growth initiatives.\n\nAs well, Cronos Group lags behind other cannabis companies in terms of production. While it produced nearly 1,600 kilos during the second quarter, that\u2019s less than one-fifth of the the 29,000 kilos Aurora Cannabis produced.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaping Concerns Could Affect CRON Stock\n\nCanadian cannabis companies are currently waiting on the second wave of cannabis legalization, set for the middle of next month. This will include a limited supply of items like vapes, cannabis-infused beverages, and edibles.\n\nBut there is a growing concern in the U.S. about the safety of vaping. More than 450 Americans dealt with vaping-related lung illnesses and five of these patients died. It\u2019s unclear what\u2019s causing the illnesses but there does seem to be a link between THC-infused products and vaping. (My InvestorPlace colleague Josh Enomoto has a contrarian take on this today.)\n\nIn March, Cronos Group received an equity investment from the tobacco giant Altria Group (NYSE:MO). Altria also owns a stake in the e-cigarette makers Juul, which gives Cronos access to additional vaping technology. However, this could pose a problem is the health-related concerns continue to gain traction.\n\nExpect More Supply Issues in Canada\n\nCanada continues to deal with ongoing supply issues since legalizing cannabis in October 2018. The regulatory agency Health Canada is dealing with a backlog of licensing applications.\n\nMost likely, Canada will still be dealing with this issues when cannabis derivatives hit the shelves in December. And it will continue to slow the ability of companies like CRON to harvest, process, and sell cannabis.\n\nAs of this writing, Jamie Johnson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Cronos Group Stock Continues to Lag as Canada Headwinds Hold Back Sector appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "description": "Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) is not alone as its shares have fallen more than 33% since April 5.
