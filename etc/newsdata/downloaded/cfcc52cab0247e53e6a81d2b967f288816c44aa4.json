Splunk\u2019s Head of Blockchain and DLT Nate McKervey explained in a tweet sent on Oct. 21 that over 10,000 event attendees were able to spend Buttercup Bucks (BCB):\n\n\u201cBCB is a digital currency running on the #Ethereum based @xdaichain. >10,000 attendees can earn and spend #BCB to buy special swag, donate to charity, and much more from their \u2018Pony Purse.\u2019\u201d\n\nSplunk advertises itself as \u201cThe Data-to-Everything Platform.\u201d At press time, its market cap was just under $18 billion, according to NASDAQ. Crunchbase estimates the company\u2019s annual revenue at $2 billion.\n\nMost won\u2019t even know they\u2019re using blockchain\n\nInterestingly, McKervey also noted that users did not need to download an app or manage private keys to interact with the system. He said:\n\n\u201cMost users won't even know they are interacting with blockchain based digital tokens.\u201d\n\nHe also explained that the BCB distribution method was rather unorthodox, with the tokens having been airdropped to 25,000 wooden poker chips. Users scanned the QR code with their phone and got hold of the value previously contained on the chip.\n\nAccording to the xDAI block explorer, there are already over 22 thousand addresses involved with the tokens and over 48 thousand BCB transactions have already taken place. Lastly, McKervey said that more announcements concerning the project will come in the future:\n\n\u201cEverything starts with the data. I'll share more throughout the week as we turn data into doing. I can't show the really cool stuff until some announcements are made :)\u201d\n\nXDAI is a crypto asset pegged to DAI, an Ethereum-based decentralized stablecoin pegged in turn to the United States Dollar. The chain\u2019s native xDAI tokens are created by locking DAI tokens in a smart contract on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. They can also be destroyed to redeem them as DAI tokens once again.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported in January, the attendees of Ethereum hardware hackathon ETHDenver have been issued an xDAI wallet that ran on their phone\u2019s default browser and came preloaded with a dedicated coin.", "description": "Publicly traded software firm Splunk is using Ethereum sidechain xDai Chain to power payments at its Las Vegas SplunkConf 2019", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNjMzYzUzNjE3NzA2NTNiNmU0Y2RiNjFlNzM2MjdiMDkuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
