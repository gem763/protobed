All that will change one day as ultimately EVs are going to prevail and automakers are already giving us signs of what\u2019s to come in terms of small performance cars without an ICE.\n\nBack in March 2017, Renault introduced the exciting Zoe E-Sport concept with a monster output of 460 bhp and 472 pound-feet of torque. Shortly after its reveal, the company with the diamond logo has said it might build the feisty electric hatch with dual electric motors, and a recent report indicates an electric Zoe RS could replace the Clio RS.\n\nNow, Renault\u2019s alliance partner Nissan is unveiling a test car based on the Leaf e+ that\u2019s similar in philosophy with the Zoe E-Sport. Thanks to a pair of electric motors \u2013 one for each axle \u2013 the EV offers a combined output of 304 bhp and 501 lb-ft. With one electric motor powering the front wheels and the other driving the rear ones, it means the experimental vehicle benefits from an AWD layout.\n\nPerformance details have not been disclosed, but Nissan says the dual-motor setup enables the Leaf to deliver \u201chighly responsive, yet uncommonly smooth, acceleration.\u201d It goes without saying it\u2019s quicker than the standard Leaf e+, which offers 214 bhp and 251 lb-ft for a 0 to 62 mph in 6.9 seconds. With an extra 90 horses and double the torque, the speedy Leaf must be a real blast to drive.\n\nNissan's electric ambitions:\n\nIt rides on 17-inch Volk Racing forged wheels with 215/55 front and 235/50 rear tyres housed in fatter wheel arches courtesy of a set of overfenders. The EV\u2019s physical dimensions have been modified a bit as it\u2019s slightly shorter, wider, and lower. Nissan also made some changes on the inside where the centre console is dominated by a massive 12.3-inch display providing real-time information about the car.\n\nEven though the sporty Leaf is not going into production, it does demonstrate Nissan can develop a performance electric hatch and also gets us ready for a soon-to-be-revealed \u201cnext-generation EV that will be a true breakthrough.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "With 501 lb-ft of torque, the electric hatch should be a real hoot.", "authors": ["Feedback", "Adrian Padeanu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2b8Ivx5DKFKc_G3fIV6l_A--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/motor1_uk_340/1fb6538fef4d922a23a46a2465c1ebf9", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
