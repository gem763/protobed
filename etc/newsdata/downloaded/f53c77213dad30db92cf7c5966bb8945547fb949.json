Do you like cats? I have a cat. I love my cat. And I love the Olympics.\n\nBy Mason Dayot Oct 3, 2019 2 min read\n\nBeing an ALT in Japan, the mantra \u201cit depends on your school\u201d really does dictate your teaching experience. Whether you\u2019ve got preschool kids slapping their backside or you\u2019re being asked if your skin tastes like chocolate, it\u2019s different for all of us in different ways.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one common ordeal that all ALTs will encounter at some point in their tenure\u2014the infamous English speech contest.\n\nNo matter which term, year, town or school you\u2019re at, this all-too-regular event always follows the exact same plotline. This is largely thanks to the generic roster of competing students who can be categorized into the five following types.\n\nCompetitor #1: The \u201cI like cats\u201d\n\nThis student will offer a forgettable run-of-the-mill speech about a personal experience that doesn\u2019t evoke any strong debate but just shows they can speak the language and gesture at appropriate times. She\u2019s ready to talk about her cat and talk about it a whoooole lot.\n\nCompetitor #2: The train otaku\n\nYes, out of the 95% female competitors, there rises a single boy. Usually, this one will speak about his passions very\u2026 passionately. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t able to express these opinions in Japanese, but he can in English because his classmates probably won\u2019t understand him.\n\nCompetitor #3: The returnee\n\nYou\u2019ll listen to this student with perfect intonation, pronunciation, and expression, all while wondering if they\u2019re a hafu or not.\n\n*Looks in the program for a Marie Brown or Yuki Smith*\n\nThen BOOM! Right when their account of a deeply personal experience comes to an end the big plot twist is revealed: they\u2019ve lived overseas for a number of years. Surprise!\n\nCompetitor #4: The forgetter\n\nOf course, not everyone is as amazing and well prepared as your own prodigy student. Sometimes they\u2019re just there because they\u2019re forced to be. These are the guys and gals who don\u2019t remember their speech but are really good at filling the room with excruciating pauses that seem to last a lifetime.\n\nCompetitor #5: The woke kid\n\nJust when you thought the content of the English speech contests ended at cats, trains, and omotenashi at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, up steps the woke kid. They tackle big societal issues about Japan and seek to be the change they want to see\u2014leaving you feeling totally inadequate with your ALT self.\n\nJokes aside, English speech contests are one area where ALTs can really make a difference with their students. At the very least, helping them get ready to duke it out against rival schools\u2019 students is an opportunity to bond over why you became a foreigner. Come to think of it, that would actually make a winning topic for an English speech contest.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mason Dayot"], "top_image": "https://gaijinpot.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2019/10/English-Speech-Contests-in-Japan-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
