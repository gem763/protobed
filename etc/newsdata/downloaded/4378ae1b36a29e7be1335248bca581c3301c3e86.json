Check out this dazzling new snapshot from the Hubble Space Telescope, which is the \u201cbest look yet at an interstellar visitor,\u201d according to NASA.\n\nThe radiant comet, called 2I/Borisov, was discovered by Crimean amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov on August 30. Scientists following up on his observations rapidly calculated the bizarre trajectory of the comet, and its unusually high speed of 110,000 miles per hour.\n\nThe International Astronomical Union confirmed that the comet was \u201cunambiguously interstellar in origin\u201d on September 24, meaning that it originally hails from another star system and crossed many light years to get here.\n\nComet 21/Borisov is the first interstellar comet ever detected in our solar system, but it is not the only exile from another star that has turned up in recent years. In 2017, a strange spliff-shaped rock called \u02bbOumuamua became the first interstellar object known to scientists. While \u02bbOumuamua may have been a comet at one time, it now lacks the cometary atmosphere that gives comet 21/Borisov its reflective glow.\n\nThese two objects offer a rare glimpse of the contents of distant star systems. Astronomers think there are probably thousands of other interstellar objects in the solar system that are too dark or distant to observe, but they are on the lookout for more.\n\nIn the meantime, Hubble will keep its lenses trained on comet 21/Borisov as it hurtles toward its closest approach to the Sun on December 8.\n\n\"New comets are always unpredictable,\" said Max Mutchler, a NASA astronomer who is part of the observation team, in a statement. \"They sometimes brighten suddenly or even begin to fragment as they are exposed to the intense heat of the Sun for the first time. Hubble is poised to monitor whatever happens next with its superior sensitivity and resolution.\"", "description": "Unlike \u02bbOumuamua, the first interstellar object ever detected, comet 2I/Borisov is radiant and gassy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da75208df4e600009d5ed1f/lede/1571246717470-Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-10601-PM.png?crop=1xw:0.7877186588921283xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
