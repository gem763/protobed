They had not even allowed a goal to the Canadians in four previous matches dating to 2007.\n\n\u201cThe first thing that stands out to me is desire, the desire of Canada,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cGive them credit, but having said that, the minimum we expect is to match that. We need to compete on every single play in games like that, and that\u2019s important. I don\u2019t think it was lack of effort, I don\u2019t think it was purposeful, but I wasn\u2019t happy with the desire that we displayed.\n\nThe U.S. already had lost to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final in July, the first competitive tournament after Berhalter was hired last December and tasked with rebuilding the program. Just 11 months remain before the start of qualifying for the 2022 World Cup.\n\nCanada went ahead in the 63rd minute after Scott Arfield dispossessed Michael Bradley on the edge of the center circle. After several passes, U.S. captain Tim Ream made a poor clearance. The ball was played back toward the American goal, and Anfield\u2019s low cross went across the goalmouth. Davies got behind DeAndre Yedlin and Aaron Long, redirecting the ball in.\n\n\u201cWhat stands out to me is just the sloppiness with the ball,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cToo many mis-controlled touches, too many missed passes, too many easy things that we normally make that we weren\u2019t making tonight.\u201d\n\nJonathan Osorio lifted the ball behind the American defense in the first minute of stoppage time. Cavallini allowed the ball to bounce twice and beat Steffen to the near post with a right-footed shot from 12 yards.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the same energy that they did,\u201d star American midfielder Christian Pulisic said. \u201cThat\u2019s very disappointing. That\u2019s the one thing that we can control and we weren\u2019t able to tonight.\u201d\n\nPulisic had a point-blank shot saved by goalkeeper Milan Borjan in the 51st minute.\n\n\u201cI should have scored no problem,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cThat\u2019s on me. Just wasn\u2019t my day, I guess.\u201d\n\nPulisic was replaced by Paul Arriola in the 60th minute. Berhalter said Pulisic has been suffering from flu-like symptoms and a \u201clight fever.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted to continue,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cYou could see the disappointment in his face.\u201d\n\nThe 21st-ranked U.S., coming off last week\u2019s opening 7-0 home rout of Cuba, had nine wins and eight draws against Canada since a 2-0 exhibition defeat at Vancouver, British Columbia, in April 1985.\n\nCanada, ranked 75th, is trying to climb past No. 72 El Salvador and into the top six in the region in FIFA rankings. The June 2020 rankings will be used to determine the nations in the hexagonal will produce the three direct qualifiers from the North and Central American and Caribbean region for the 2022 World Cup\n\nDavies, an 18-year-old budding star, said he felt \u201cmillions of emotions running through me on that goal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey treated it like it was a cup final,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cThey stepped up harder, they reacted quicker to every loose ball. In all the little ways in a game like that, they were on top of things. We\u2019re disappointed with ourselves that we couldn\u2019t do more in terms of better reactions, stepping up harder, coming away with little plays in different parts of the field that make a bigger difference.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and Canada meet again Nov. 15 at Orlando, Florida, and the U.S. faces Cuba four days later George Town, Cayman Islands.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to respond in a strong way,\u201d Bradley said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The U.S. keeps coming up with underwhelming performances in its first year under Gregg Berhalter, whose tenure as American coach is starting to draw criticism.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ian Harrison"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/concacaf_us_canada_soccer_93303_c0-103-2469-1543_s1200x700.jpg?9a7c6a0ef8ecf2d7f9befe1474573f52886cf8f7", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
