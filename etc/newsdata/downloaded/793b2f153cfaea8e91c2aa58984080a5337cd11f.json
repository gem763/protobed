Though all are showing double-digit rent inflation, for the moment, prices are static, said Doug Shephard, director at Home.co.uk.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll the top-performing boroughs in the lettings market\u2014in terms of rent growth\u2014will soon translate into the top performing sales markets in London, as increasing numbers of investors spot the opportunity and capitalise on better yielding housing assets,\u201d Mr. Shephard said in the report.\n\n\n\n\u201cSales stock levels in the central London boroughs haven\u2019t been this low for several years and prices look set to surge accordingly as demand picks up,\u201d he said. \u201cEven Brexit pandemonium is not enough to quench the natural re-emergence of vigor in the London property cycle.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Salvador Dali\u2019s Art and Sculptures on Selling Exhibition in London\n\nRental supply has been falling steadily as new taxes and regulations implemented in the lettings sector have made the market less appealing for landlords.\n\n\n\nIn April 2017, the U.K. began effectively increasing taxes on landlords by phasing out a mortgage interest deduction on buy-to-let properties. The deduction has been lowered by 25% each year since and will be eliminated next year.\n\n\n\nThe rise came on the heels of a 3% increase to the stamp duty tax for additional and buy-to-let home purchases introduced in 2016.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-106659?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
