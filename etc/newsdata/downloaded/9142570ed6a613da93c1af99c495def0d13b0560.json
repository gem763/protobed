In 927, King Aethelstan invaded Northumbria, occupied York and expelled King of Ireland Anlaf Guthfrithson's kinsmen, the rulers of York and Dublin. Ten years later, in the summer of 937, Anlaf and Constantine launched their invasion with 'the biggest Viking fleet ever seen in British waters'. At some point later in the year Aethelstan advanced out of Mercia and attacked the main allied army around Brunanburh. In a battle described as 'immense, lamentable and horrible', King Aethelstan defeated a Viking fleet led by the Anlaf and Constantine, the King of Alba. Anlaf escaped by sea and arrived back in Dublin the following spring. Had King Athelstan - grandson of Alfred the Great - been defeated it would have been the end of Anglo-Saxon England. But upon victory, Britain was created for the first time and Athelstan became the de facto King of all Britain, the first in history.\n\nDespite the significance of the historical conclusion archaeologists have refused to disclose the exact location to the public, reports The Sun.\n\nThe Battle of Brunanburh is one believed to have shaped the countries we know now as England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nAt the time of the battle, Britain was a divided nation ruled by the Celts in the far north, the Earls of Northumberland (of Norse, viking decent) in the north of England and most of Ireland while the Anglo Saxons controlled central and southern England.\n\nBrunanburh saw the Anglo Saxons go head to head with a joint army of Celts and Norse warriors.\n\nIn the bloody battle, six kings and seven earls are believed to have been slain.\n\nUntil now, proposed sites for the battle have stretched from southwest England to as far as Scotland with Professor Michael Wood, a TV historian for the BBC believing it unfolded 100miles away from Merseyside in South Yorkshire.\n\nExperts at Wirral Archaeology said the location of the battle is yet to be disclosed to the public due for 'security purposes'.\n\nA spokesman told The Sun: 'Several eminent historians and academics have examined a range of evidence we have collected, including physical artefacts\n\n'They have concluded that the lost site of the Battle of Brunanburh may have been identified by Wirral Archaeology.\n\n'There is still a great deal of investigative work that needs to be done.'\n\nAdding that the investigations were being carried out by a variety of experts including historians, archaeologists and scientists.\n\nIn 927, Anglo Saxon King Aethelstan invaded Northumbria, occupied York and expelled King of Ireland Anlaf Guthfrithson's kinsmen, the rulers of York and Dublin.\n\nA consensus emerged that the battle took place in Bromborough on the Wirral, Merseyside, but TV historian Professor Michael Wood is convinced it actually unfolded 100 miles away in South Yorkshire\n\nThreatened by Aethelstan's advances, ten years later in the summer of 937, Anlaf and Constantine launched their invasion with 'the biggest Viking fleet ever seen in British waters'.\n\nAt some point later in the year Aethelstan advanced out of Mercia (central England) and attacked the main allied army around Brunanburh.\n\nIn a battle described as 'immense, lamentable and horrible', King Aethelstan defeated a Viking fleet led by the Anlaf and Constantine, the King of Alba.\n\nAnlaf escaped by sea and arrived back in Dublin the following spring.\n\nThe name Bromborough comes from an Old English place name Brunanburh or 'Bruna's fort' which is the same as the battle.", "description": "For decades archaeologists have disagreed over the location of the\u00a0Battle of Brunanburh, 937 AD.
