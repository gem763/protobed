But I also pray that God will illuminate him to see right from wrong. It's very problematic.\u201d\n\nPelosi also said that Attorney General William Barr had \u201cgone rogue\u201d in his handling of the whistleblower complaint and that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire broke the law by taking the complaint to the White House even though Trump and Barr were mentioned in it.\n\nPelosi also said that she still hoped to work with Trump on an infrastructure funding bill.\n\n\u201cI think where they are going is the coverup of the coverup, and that's really very sad for them,\u201d said Pelosi. \u201cTo have a Justice Department go so rogue \u2014 well, they had been for a while \u2014 and now it just makes matters worse that the attorney general was mentioned, the president was mentioned, and yet the Justice Department directed the director of national intelligence to take it to the White House.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and President Trump.

I think that what he did broke the law. The law is very clear.\u201d\n\nMore than 218 House Democrats now support the impeachment inquiry, and if they were to all vote yes on an article of impeachment, it would pass and Trump would be officially impeached. The proceedings would then move to a Senate trial in which two-thirds of the chamber would need to vote to remove him from office. On Thursday, a number of Republican senators said they hadn\u2019t had time to read the full whistleblower complaint that details Trump attempting to pressure the Ukrainian government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The complaint is nine pages.\n\nPolling done since Pelosi formally announced the inquiry on Tuesday shows support for impeachment growing, but it\u2019s still short of a majority of Americans.\n\nWhile Pelosi was on MSNBC, the president spent his morning demanding the resignation of Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s House Intelligence hearing with DNI chief Maguire, Schiff laid out how he believed the July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky transpired. Schiff made it clear he was giving his interpretation of how the call went, but Trump wrote that he was \u201csupposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public,\u201d wrote Trump. \u201cHe has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s likely Trump or his staff saw a viral tweet from conservative operative Benny Johnson, which included a video of Schiff at the hearing that cut off the part where he described the call as, \u201cWell, it reads like a classic organized crime shakedown. Shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words, this is the essence of what the president communicates.\u201d\n\nDuring the House hearing Thursday, Maguire said he thought the whistleblower had acted in good faith and had done \u201cthe right thing.\u201d\n\nTrump also took time out from his presidential duties on Friday morning to defend his English grammar and usage.\n\n\u201cTo show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is, I used the word Liddle\u2019, not Liddle, in discribing Corrupt Congressman Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff,\u201d wrote Trump. \u201cLow ratings @CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!\u201d\n\nThe punctuation mark to which Trump referred in the tweet was an apostrophe, not a hyphen. The president also misspelled \u201cdescribing\u201d and capitalized \u201cCorrupt,\u201d which is not standard English, since it does not constitute Schiff\u2019s formal title. Most grammarians prescribe a hyphen in a compound adjective, such as \u201cnever-ending.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Trump took to cable news and Twitter on Friday morning as the first week of the impeachment battle came to a close in Washington.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/crdCurwd8uctrYzVYLMZEQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/795e9390-e12d-11e9-bbed-76de82af4e9a", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
