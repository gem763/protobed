Read this first", "language": "en", "text": "On Aug. 22, 2001, Enron vice president Sherron Watkins presented CEO Ken Lay with documents and a summary of facts regarding the Houston-anchored energy company\u2019s accounting problems. The scandal would eventually bring down Enron.\n\nWatkins thought Lay would consult with accounting and legal experts and realize Enron had manipulated its financial statements and likely committed fraud. She also expected her boss would form a crisis management team, figure out the salvageable business lines and brace for a financial tsunami.\n\nAlso see: Trump whistleblower expected to testify \u2018very soon,\u2019 with identity concealed\n\nOf course, Lay took no such actions. Enron soon imploded, declaring bankruptcy on Dec. 2, 2001, and cemented itself in the annals of corporate America as a classic case of greed and hubris.\n\nWatkins would later learn that Enron\u2019s outside law firm, Vinson and Elkins, had advised the company\u2019s lawyers on the potential consequences of discharging employees who raised accounting concerns.\n\nTheir letter was dated just two days after Watkins\u2019 meeting with Lay.\n\n\u201cI was naive as to why the messenger gets shot,\u201d Watkins, 59, told MarketWatch in an email. \u201cNo one wants to hear bad news, and they tend to ignore and [shoot] the messenger.\u201d Watkins, who lives in Georgetown, Texas, now speaks publicly about leadership and ethics.\n\nMark Wilson/Getty Images Former Enron vice president Sherron Watkins watches as former Enron president Jeffrey Skilling testifies in 2002.\n\nBlowing the whistle today\n\nWhistleblowers have dominated headlines in recent months. For instance, former Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.28% accountant Sandra Kuba said she had alleged to the Securities and Exchange Commission that employees at the company had inflated revenue for years by billions of dollars, MarketWatch reported this week. (Disney dismissed Kuba\u2019s claims as \u201cutterly without merit.\u201d)\n\nIn another case, a memo released in early April revealed that Tricia Newbold, a career official in the White House\u2019s personnel security office, had told a congressional committee that dozens of security-clearance application rejections administered by her office were later overturned despite \u201cdisqualifying issues.\u201d (The White House did not return a request for comment, but some Republicans suggested at the time that Democrats used \u201ccherry-picked excerpts\u201d from Newbold\u2019s testimony to \u201cmanufacture a misleading narrative.\u201d)\n\nMeanwhile, Theranos whistleblowers Erika Cheung and Tyler Shultz attracted renewed attention this past spring with the debut of a new ABC News podcast and HBO documentary about the so-called Silicon Valley unicorn.\n\nCheung and Shultz, who alerted health regulators to their concerns about the now-defunct blood-testing startup and spoke with Wall Street Journal investigative reporter John Carreyrou, launched an Ethics in Entrepreneurship nonprofit earlier this year.\n\nSome also frame the #MeToo movement, through which many employees have spoken out about workplace abuses of power, as a form of mass whistleblowing.\n\nJohn Kostyack, the executive director of the National Whistleblower Center advocacy nonprofit, says he believes there has never been a better time to be a whistleblower in this country.\n\n\u201cWe like to destroy the myth that in order to help fight corruption or wrongdoing, you have to sacrifice your livelihood and put yourself and your family at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can do this confidentially [and] anonymously, and you can benefit financially.\u201d\n\nAmerican politics and business are strewn with famous and sometimes infamous whistleblowers \u2014 among them Watergate informant Deep Throat (later revealed to be FBI official W. Mark Felt), former Pentagon staffer Linda Tripp and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden \u2014 who have shone a light on legal and ethical misdeeds, often at great professional and personal risk.\n\nSome live with complicated legacies: Snowden, alternately deemed a hero and a traitor for his role in uncovering the United States\u2019 domestic surveillance practices, lives in exile in Moscow. Tripp, whose secretly taped phone calls with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky eventually led to Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment, now says she endured \u201ca real high-tech lynching\u201d for the role she played \u2014 but only regrets \u201cnot having the guts to do it sooner.\u201d\n\nA professional and personal toll\n\nBlowing the whistle can be a thankless job. More than a third of respondents who reported wrongdoing and were identified as the source were either threatened with or received a reprisal as a result, according to a 2010 survey by the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d agency that hears federal employees\u2019 appeals of removals, demotions and suspensions.\n\nWhistleblowing can take a substantial emotional toll, too. One 2018 analysis in the Netherlands found that \u201cwhistleblowers were significantly more at risk for severe mental-health problems, poor global health, and worsening health\u201d than other population-based groups.\n\nMany also indicated that whistleblowing had a \u201csevere and negative effect\u201d on work; income; and relationships with ex-colleagues, partners and children, according to the research, which was published in the peer-reviewed journal Psychological Reports.\n\n\u201cThose risks are higher when you\u2019re in a place with a bad culture that does not support whistleblowing,\u201d Jennifer Pacella, an assistant professor of law at Baruch College, told MarketWatch. \u201cI\u2019m confident that with future generations, that will start to shift.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower who inspired \u2018The Informant\u2019 says he wouldn\u2019t do it again\n\nMark Whitacre, a high-ranked executive turned FBI informant in the mid-1990s lysine price-fixing scandal at food-processing company Archer Daniels Midland ADM, +0.32%, says many whistleblowers struggle to find work after coming forward.\n\nThree former executives were eventually sentenced for their roles in a global scheme to fix prices, including Whitacre. Whitacre lost his immunity from prosecution as a witness when it was discovered that he was taking millions of dollars from the company while working as an informant. He eventually pleaded guilty to fraud.\n\n\u201cMost of them say they would have left the company and not [gotten] involved,\u201d Whitacre, 61, told MarketWatch. \u201cI rarely hear one that says they\u2019re glad they did what they did.\u201d\n\nWhitacre, whom Matt Damon portrayed in the 2009 Steven Soderbergh film \u201cThe Informant,\u201d says he had grown consumed with greed, power and corporate ladder-climbing at ADM. He credits his wife of nearly 40 years, Ginger Whitacre, with demanding he turn himself in to the FBI.\n\nTimothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images Mark Whitacre was the subject of the 2009 film \u2018The Informant!,\u2019 starring Matt Damon.\n\nWhitacre wore a wire at work for almost three years, and in 1995, the FBI raided ADM. The company later fired Whitacre and alleged he had embezzled millions from ADM; his subsequent conviction landed him in federal prison for nine years.\n\nGinger and their children relocated to each of Whitacre\u2019s prison locations during his incarceration, he said, visiting every weekend and holiday. The couple calls their saga \u201ca messy story with a good ending,\u201d he said. But they wouldn\u2019t do it again, he added.\n\n\u201cKnowing what we know today, we would have left,\u201d said Whitacre, a Cornell University Ph.D who now works as the chief operating officer of a biotech company. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it was our responsibility to have to do that.\u201d\n\nNearly three decades later, Whitacre admits \u201cthere\u2019s a little more respect for whistleblowers\u201d in society today. \u201cI still don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy for them \u2014 but I think it would be easier, for what we did 25 years ago, to do it today,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit more protection for them.\u201d\n\nWhistleblowers have more protections than ever\n\nHere are some of the most salient whistleblower and anti-retaliation protections available now:\n\n\u2022 The SEC whistleblower program, created under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, entitles eligible whistleblowers to an award of 10% to 30% of the amount recovered, provided sanctions exceed $1 million. The program allows whistleblowers to submit information anonymously.\n\n\u2022 The 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act offers whistleblowers at publicly traded companies protection against retaliation in fraud cases.\n\n\u2022 The 1863 False Claims Act, amended in 1986 and multiple times thereafter to strengthen whistleblower incentives, allows people to sue federal contractors for fraud on behalf of the government and receive a bounty of between 15% and 30%. (Whistleblowers in an FCA case, aka \u201crelators,\u201d aren\u2019t guaranteed anonymity.)\n\n\u2022 Many states have their own false claims acts that cover state funds.\n\n\u2022 The Internal Revenue Service offers a payout of up to 30% to whistleblowers with information on people who fail to pay their taxes.\n\n\u2022 The 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act and 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act protect federal employees.\n\n\u2022 The Affordable Care Act offers whistleblower protections to employees who receive an IRS credit under the ACA and those who report violations of the ACA.\n\n\u2022 There are also legal protections for environmental whistleblowers, food-safety whistleblowers, airline-employee whistleblowers and several other groups.\n\nDespite these protections, there is a \u201cfairly complex\u201d set of laws and procedures that can land you in trouble if you fail to navigate them properly, Kostyack said. \u201cThere\u2019s a way to address corruption and to not put yourself at personal risk like there was at one point,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it requires following procedures, and staying within timelines, and having an intermediary who can represent you and communicate with law enforcement.\u201d\n\nHow to blow the whistle without putting yourself at risk\n\nHere are tips from legal experts and whistleblowers on how to say something when you see something \u2014 while minimizing your own risk:\n\nFirst, talk to a lawyer. A lawyer who specializes in whistleblower law should be able to answer questions about possible bounties and anti-retaliation protections, and give a second opinion on whether an issue is whistleblower-worthy, said attorney Reuben Guttman of the firm Guttman, Buschner & Brooks, which has represented whistleblowers in False Claims Act cases. Look for an attorney who has tried cases, Guttman added, and review their writings and case histories.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is something you want to try to do on your own,\u201d Kostyack said. Preserving your confidentiality and having a lawyer help you understand the risks and rewards associated with collecting information is a wise move, he said. Plus, \u201cin many corruption cases, multiple statutes are violated. A qualified attorney will be able to advise a whistleblower which laws apply to her or his situation.\u201d\n\nWeigh the consequences on both sides, Whitacre said. \u201cWhat will happen if you don\u2019t blow the whistle? How critical is it? Are people\u2019s lives in danger if you don\u2019t blow the whistle?\u201d he said. On the other hand, he added, consider what your next steps might be if you forge ahead. \u201cMy wife and I went up against one of the biggest companies in the world, and it was a tough go,\u201d he said.\n\nFully inform yourself of the potential risks involved, including retaliation, added employment attorney Paula Brantner. \u201cThe laws are complicated, the protections aren\u2019t always straightforward, and there can be consequences,\u201d she told MarketWatch.\n\n\u201cThe legal system offers what protection it offers, but it\u2019s rarely tilted in favor of the little guy and gal \u2014 so it can be very scary, it can be very intimidating, and relief may be a long time in coming.\u201d\n\nEstablish a support network. \u201cObviously, you\u2019ll want the support of your family and your close friends,\u201d Brantner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very isolating experience.\u201d\n\nFigure out whether it makes sense to blow the whistle internally. \u201cInternal whistleblowing is actually very beneficial to the organization, because it allows an organization to address a problem in a very early stage,\u201d Pacella said.\n\nOn the other hand, \u201cif eliminating the wrongdoing is going to eliminate a material part of the company\u2019s profits, then it\u2019s pretty clear that solving the problem internally is not going to work,\u201d Guttman added.\n\nPacella and Guttman advise considering your workplace culture \u2014 is it retaliatory, or does management encourage feedback? \u2014 as well as the track record of your company\u2019s ethics department. (A number of companies also provide confidential, anonymous whistleblower hotlines.)\n\nDocument everything, take notes, and suss out potential witnesses, Brantner said. Gather as much documentation as you can by \u201clegitimate means,\u201d she added. That means no stealing documents, snooping in someone else\u2019s files or compiling information by deceptive means. \u201cDon\u2019t engage in wrongdoing yourself,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd after you\u2019ve blown the whistle, document any events you think may constitute retaliation, Pacella said. \u201cKeep good records for yourself, so you\u2019re building a body of evidence in the event that you seek to get redress for having experienced retaliation,\u201d she said.\n\nBe mindful of time. \u201cVarious so-called statutes of limitations place limits on how much time can pass between the last illegal act and when the whistleblower files her or his claim,\u201d Kostyack said.\n\nBe smart about how you communicate. Don\u2019t use company-issued computers, phones, electronic devices or WiFi signals to reach out to attorneys or journalists, Kostyack said. \u201cWhistleblowers should know that when a company is committing fraud, every internal communication is likely being tracked by their superiors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis includes emails, phone conversations, and website visits using company technology, as we recently found in the Theranos case.\u201d Instead, he recommends in-person meetings or using encrypted email or secure websites \u2014 accessed off company property and with non-company-issued technology.\n\nTake care not to use exact phrases or figures that could be traced back to you with a quick search of your emails by management. That was how management at Theranos first earmarked Shultz as a whistleblower and, subsequently, threatened him with legal action \u2014 a process that cost him six figures in legal-defense fees.\n\nIf you played a role in the misconduct, \u201cbe aware that your own conduct will be scrutinized,\u201d Brantner said. Consult with a lawyer about your potential risks in coming forward based on your own actions.\n\nJoin forces. \u201cTalk amongst your peers, find others who agree with your assessment and report together,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cThere is strength in numbers. Ken Lay could dismiss my concerns as the opinion of one person.\u201d", "description": "Legal experts and whistleblowers share advice on how to say something when you see something.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP854_holmes_ZG_20190821095812.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-10"}
