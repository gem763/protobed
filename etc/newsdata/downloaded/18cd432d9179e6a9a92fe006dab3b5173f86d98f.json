Even if the plug is pulled at the last moment, the campaign is starting already and all the parties will have to decide what manifesto they will offer the voters.\n\nAs we report today, the Labour leader is coming under pressure from many of his shadow cabinet colleagues to harden the commitment to a referendum on any Brexit deal. So far, it is an option that has to be kept \u201con the table\u201d, and senior members of the shadow cabinet have said different things about whether it would be required under any circumstances and about what might be on the ballot paper.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The argument of principle is that a new referendum is the only democratic way to resolve the Brexit morass. Parliament and the nation are now divided three ways, between leaving the EU with a deal, leaving without a deal, or not leaving at all.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Then it was assumed that we would negotiate a deal and leave. That history has now been rewritten by fundamentalist Brexiteers as being a vote to leave without a deal \u2013 although they say a deal, entirely on the UK\u2019s terms, would have been an acceptable optional extra.\n\nThus the Leave majority at that referendum has fractured. Many Conservative MPs and party members regard the prime minister\u2019s exit deal as a form of remaining in the EU. They have more in common with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party than they do with their own leader.\n\nThere is no majority in the House of Commons for either a no-deal Brexit or for the prime minister\u2019s deal, and no way of restructuring the way MPs vote seems likely to yield one \u2013 despite the pretence by Ms May and Mr Corbyn that they are negotiating to find one.\n\nThe only way to avoid endless deadlock and repeated requests for extensions to the Brexit deadline, therefore, is to return the decision to the people, as The Independent has argued since last year.\n\nAnd if the argument of principle does not persuade Mr Corbyn, the tactical case should do so. He knows that the petition to revoke Article 50 has attracted 6 million signatures. He knows too that Labour won 4 million votes in the last European elections five years ago. And he knows that the Independent Group of MPs, standing as Change UK, are likely to attract considerable support in next month\u2019s elections. Change UK will be campaigning on a platform of a new referendum with a view to cancelling Brexit.\n\nJust as there will be many Tory voters tempted to vote for Mr Farage\u2019s new outfit, there will be many Labour voters keen to vote for the new pro-EU option. If Mr Corbyn wants to maximise the Labour vote, he should match Heidi Allen and Chuka Umunna\u2019s policy of a referendum.\n\nThis is an important test for the Labour leader. If he is in doubt, he should listen to his own democratic instincts and say: let the people decide.", "description": "For many months Labour\u2019s leaders have hedged and fudged and dodged on the subject of a new referendum on Brexit.
