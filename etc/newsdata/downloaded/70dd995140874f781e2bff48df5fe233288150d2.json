An unprecedented number of black renters in Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago and other urban centers became homeowners.\n\nBut the program was troubled from the start. The conditions that allowed for homeownership also set the groundwork for fraud. Racist exclusion gave way to predatory inclusion.\n\nSpeculators bought decrepit or even condemned houses on the cheap and then quickly flipped them. F.H.A. appraisers, often part-time real estate agents, would sometimes pocket bribes to inflate the value of the house.\n\nMeanwhile, bankers signed off on bloated appraisals because Washington absorbed the risk. These bankers made money on both the fees to make the loan and the closing costs to sell the house, so they cared only about issuing a huge number of mortgages, which they\u2019d package and resell. It didn\u2019t matter to them whether a house went into foreclosure.", "description": "", "authors": ["Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Sunday Blacks-Hud-Real-Estate.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
