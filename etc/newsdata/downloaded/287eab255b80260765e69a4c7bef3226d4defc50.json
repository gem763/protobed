He claimed that the Turkish forces had 'neutralised' around 750 Syrian Kurdish fighters.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan speaking during his meeting with foreign journalists at Dolmabahce Office in Istanbul today\n\nA man injured during the ongoing Turkish offensive against Kurdish-controlled areas of northeastern Syria receive treatment at a hospital in Tal Tamr, near the Syrian Kurdish town of Ras al-Ain today\n\nTurkish soldiers stand on top of an army tank before moving towards the Syrian border today in Ceylanpinar, Turkey\n\nPeople are being carried in the trunk of a truck as residents continue returning home after Tal Abyad city centre was cleared of PKK forces\n\nThe Turkish leader said Turkey and allied Syrian opposition forces captured some 65 settlements, including the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al Ayn.\n\nErdogan added his country 'cannot forget' the harshly worded letter from President Donald Trump about the Turkish military offensive into Syria.\n\nBut he said the mutual 'love and respect' between the two leaders prevents him from keeping it on Turkey's agenda.\n\nThese are Erdogan's first comments concerning the October 9 letter from Trump, in which among other things he warned Erdogan not to be a 'tough guy'.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Istanbul, Erdogan said Turkey would 'do what's necessary' concerning the letter 'when the time comes'. He did not elaborate.\n\nHe said: 'President Trump's letter, which did not go hand in hand with political and diplomatic courtesy, has appeared in the media. Of course we haven't forgotten it. It would not be right for us to forget it.'\n\nThe Turkish president claimed Syrian Kurdish fighters are withdrawing from parts of northeast Syria. That follows a cease-fire agreement reached between Turkey and the United States a day earlier.\n\nHe said his country's defence minister confirmed that the Kurdish fighters had begun withdrawing. However, Erdogan added that Turkish troops will remain in northeast Syria to monitor whether 'this terror organisation [is] truly leaving the area'.\n\nActivists and a Syria war monitor says the Kurdish-led force and Turkey-backed fighters are clashing on the outskirts of Ras al-Ayn, a town along the border that is part of a ceasefire agreement.\n\nPresident Bashar al-Assad (third right) meeting with Alexander Lavrentyev (fourth left), Russia's special envoy on Syria, and Sergei Vershinin (third left), Russia's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in charge of Syrian affairs, in the capital Damascus today\n\nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad meeting with his Kremlin backers in Damascus today.

These are all speculation, disinformation.'\n\nThe Turkish leader said he would hold further talks on northeast Syria with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week.\n\nHe said: 'With these discussions, God willing we will bring peace to the area.'\n\nThe Rojava Center said its activists on the ground reported advances by Turkey-backed forces on two villages.\n\nOther activists reported a new exodus of civilians from the villages as fighting continued.\n\nA Kurdish fighter said there were attacks near the hospital in the centre of Ras al-Ayn.

I said they're going to have to fight a little while.\n\n'Like two kids in a lot, you have got to let them fight and then you pull them apart.\n\n'They fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious.'\n\nMore than 500 people have been killed including dozens of civilians, mostly on the Kurdish side, and 300,000 civilians have been displaced within Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaking during a campaign rally last night at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas.

They're going to move back a little bit,' Trump said.\n\n'We are going to keep ISIS nice and locked up. We are going to find more of them, and Turkey is all set.'\n\nYesterday Trump hailed the success of the peace agreement as a 'great day for civilization' despite Turkish officials down playing the outcome of the deal.\n\nPence announced the US and Turkey reached a deal to suspend Ankara's operations in northern Syria for five days to allow Kurds time to withdraw to a 'safe zone'.\n\nAlong with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Pence spent more than four hours meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other officials in Ankara in order to get a deal.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement requires the Kurdish fighters to vacate a swathe of territory in Syria along the Turkish border, largely solidifying Turkey's position.\n\nTurkish officials down played the agreement, saying they agreed to suspend operations to let the Kurds withdraw and emphasised it was 'not a ceasefire'.\n\nAnd within 13 hours of the announcement, shelling and smoke could be seen around the town of Ras al-Ayn this morning.\n\nSmoke billowed over the buildings as gunfire and shelling could be heard inside the city, though it was unclear which side was firing, according to official observers.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (left) meeting Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (right) at the Presidential Complex in Ankara yesterday to broker a deal\n\nSyrians poses with a Turkish flag while Turkish-backed Syrian fighters move by with armored vehicles from the north of the country for military operations\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian rebel fighters gesture as they stand at a back of a truck in the border town of Tal Abyad, Syria, yesterday\n\nTurkish soldiers are seen in an undated image (above) in the border town of Tal Abyad, Syria, in this photo released yesterday\n\nA woman wringing a garment at the Kurdish-run al-Hol camp for the displaced where families of ISIS foreign fighters\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported intermittent clashes in Ras al-Ayn but relative calm elsewhere since the ceasefire.\n\nThe city, also known as Sari Kani, has been the centre of the majority of the fighting since Turkish President Erdogan invaded the country more than a week ago following Trump's US troops withdraw.\n\nHowever Erdogan claimed today that there were no ongoing clashes in northeastern Syria.\n\nHe added it will continue its offensive into Syria more rapidly than before if the agreement with the US to pause the operation and allow a Kurdish withdrawal is not fully implemented.\n\nReaction around the world to continued fighting in northern Syria French President Emmanuel Macron branded Turkey's military operation in Syria as 'madness'. Speaking in Brussels today after a meeting of the European Union, Macron said he wants France, Germany and Britain to organise a meeting 'in the coming weeks' with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Macron reaffirmed that foreign fighters from ISIS who might flee Syrian detention centres and go to Iraq should be arrested and sent to trial there. For those who would try to go to France, 'there's no direct airline from the Syrian camps to Paris-Charles de Gaulle [airport]', he said. Macron said French members of the ISIS group who might got to Turkey on their way to France would be arrested and sent to trial in France, according to a cooperation protocol between France and Turkey. Boris Johnson, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron are expected to meet with Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan in London in the coming weeks over Syria, the French President has said. He told a press conference at the close of the EU summit in Brussels that members 'expressed our joint position condemning Turkey's incursion in the north-east of Syria'. 'Together with Prime Minister Johnson and Chancellor Merkel we decided that we would be meeting President Erdogan probably in London in the coming weeks,' Macron said. 'It's about bringing some more coherence within Nato, and let me remind each and every one that Turkey is a member of Nato, which should also bring about some form of solidarity.' EU Council President Donald Tusk says the 'so-called' Syria cease-fire is 'a demand of capitulation of the Kurds' and called on Turkey to immediately halt its operation.\n\nErdogan also told journalists that it was not a problem for Turkey if Syrian government forces, backed by Russia, were to enter areas cleared of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, adding that Ankara had no intention to stay in areas under its control.\n\nHe also said he informed Trump about the offensive in a phone call three days before the operation started, adding that 'what is necessary will be done when the time is right' about a letter from Trump in which he told Erdogan to not be a 'fool' and 'tough guy'.\n\nThe United Nations said today that more than 2,300 people, mostly women and children, had fled fighting in northeastern Syria and crossed into Iraq in recent days.\n\nThe fighting today came after the commander of Kurdish-led forces in Syria, Mazloum Abdi, told Kurdish TV late on Thursday: 'We will do whatever we can for the success of the ceasefire agreement.'\n\nBut one Kurdish official, Razan Hiddo, declared that the Kurdish people would refuse to live under Turkish occupation.\n\nToday a member of the Syrian Kurdish force said its fighters will not pull back from border towns, asserting that an agreement with Turkey to vacate those areas 'will not work'.\n\nA spokesman for the Syrian Kurdish forces said today the border town remains besieged and is being shelled by Turkey and its allied forces.\n\nMervan, a spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, said Friday his group's militiamen are not withdrawing in accordance with the cease-fire deal reached overnight because the town of Ras al-Ayn remains besieged. He says Turkey and allied fighters continue to target the town.\n\nWhen asked about pulling fighters back to vacate border areas, Mervan said: 'So far there is nothing.'\n\nMervan, who goes by this nickname in accordance with the group's regulations, added: 'It seems that under this deal they want to commit more massacres.'\n\nThe Kurdish Red Crescent said its vehicles can't reach Ras al-Ayn to evacuate the wounded.\n\nWhile the Kurds call it a cease-fire, Turkey refers to the agreement as a pause and the two sides disagree on the size of the cease-fire area.\n\nKurdish fighters have already been driven out of much - but not all - of a swathe of territory that stretches about 60 miles along the middle of the Syrian-Turkish border, between Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad.\n\nStill entrenched in Ras al-Ayn, Kurdish forces were fiercely battling Turkish-backed Syrian fighters trying to take the town yesterday.\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian fighters riding in the back of a pick up truck in the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad today\n\nAn injured man during the ongoing Turkish offensive against Kurdish-controlled areas of Syria receiving treatment at a hospital in Tal Tamr, near the Syrian Kurdish town of Ras al-Ain today\n\nAn armoured Turkish army vehicle is transported near the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, Sanliurfa province, Turkey, today\n\nSmoke rising over the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, as seen from the Turkish border town today in Ceylanpinar, Turkey\n\nTurkey's pro-government dominated media hailed the US-Turkish ceasefire deal as a victory for Turkey's president.\n\nErdogan's plan for a 20-mile deep 'safe zone', instigated by his so-called 'Operation Peace Spring', were scuppered last night when President Bashar al-Assad's Syrian forces rolled into the symbolic border stronghold of Kobane.\n\nKurdish commanders begged the Syrian regime in Damascus to come to their aid after their US allies during the fierce battle to push back the so-called caliphate left them to the mercy of Turkish-backed forces.\n\nTurkey says the 'safe zone' would make room to settle up to 2 million Syrian refugees it is currently hosting, and would push back the YPG militia which it deems a terrorist group because of its links to Kurdish insurgents in southeast Turkey.\n\nA Turkish official told Reuters that Ankara got 'exactly what we wanted' from the talks with the United States.\n\nWith the United States pulling its entire 1,000-strong contingent from northern Syria, the extent of Turkey's ambitions is likely to be determined by Russia and Iran, filling the vacuum created by the US retreat.\n\nThe government of President Assad, backed by Moscow and Tehran, has already taken up positions in territory formerly protected by Washington, after an invitation by the Kurds.\n\nKurdish officials posted a video on social media showing children with burns, injuries that one doctor in Hasakeh province claimed were consistent with the use of banned weapons.\n\nBut the British-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said it could not confirm the allegation that napalm-like weapons were being used on the Kurds.\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian fighters driving armored vehicles from northern Syria for a military operation in Kurdish areas near the border today\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian fighters sitting in the middle of a roundabout in the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad yesterday\n\nFighting continued in a northeast Syrian border town Ras al-Ayn (pictured above today) despite a US-brokered ceasefire that went into effect overnight\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) fighters driving in Sanliurfa, Turkey, today as they head for the border to reach Tal Abyad in Syria\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan greeting people as he leaves from a mosque after the Friday prayers in Istanbul today\n\nThe war monitor did say it had seen a spike in burn wounds over the last two days from casualties, including civilians.\n\nAmnesty International today said that Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies had committed 'war crimes', including summary executions and and 'unlawful attacks' during their offensive in northeast Syria, which began on October 9.\n\nIt also said Kurdish female politician Hevrin Khalaf and her bodyguard were summarily executed by members of the Syrian National Army, a Turkish-funded and trained group.\n\nAt least two more executions of Kurdish fighters were confirmed, while Turkey's Syrian allies had kidnapped two employees of a local medical organisation, Amnesty added.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels after a meeting of the European Union, Macron said he wants France, Germany and Britain to organise a meeting 'in the coming weeks'.\n\nThe French president also decried NATO's inability to react what he called Turkey's 'crazy' offensive said it was time Europe stopped acting like a junior ally when it came to the Middle East.\n\nDiscovering through Twitter that the US was pulling its troops out of northern Syria, which forced France to also withdraw its special forces, made it seem as if Europe was an inconsequential ally, Macron said.\n\n'I consider what's happened in the last few days (in northern Syria) to be a serious mistake by the West and NATO in the region', Macron told reporters after a European Council summit in Brussels.\n\n'I thought we were in NATO. I thought that the United States and Turkey were in NATO, and then I discovered by tweet that the US had decided to withdraw its troops and pave the way [for Turkey's offensive] in the area.\n\nTurkish President Erdogan wanted to install an 20-mile 'safe zone' along the Syrian side of the border as part of his 'Operation Peace Spring'.

So that raises questions about how NATO functions.'\n\nEuropean Council president Donald Tusk said today after a meeting of EU leaders that Turkey's US-brokered truce was not serious and demanded Ankara halt its offensive against Kurdish forces.\n\n'The situation is quite obvious. This so-called 'ceasefire' is not what we expected. In fact it's not a ceasefire, it's a demand of capitulation for the Kurds,' he told reporters.\n\nTrump has already faced accusations even from usually loyal supporters in Washington that his withdrawal of 1,000 US troops betrayed Kurdish militants who bore the brunt of the fight against Islamic State in recent years.\n\nBrett McGurk, former presidential special envoy for the anti-ISIS coalition, described Trump's remarks about 'two kids' fighting as 'obscene and ignorant.'\n\nHe said on Twitter: '200k innocent people displaced. Hundreds dead. Credible reports of war crimes. ISIS prisoners escaping. US evacuating and bombing its own positions or handing them to Russia. Two kids in a lot?'\n\nAfter the peace deal was announced the White House repeatedly touted the fragile five-day ceasefire.\n\nTrump told the crowd at the campaign rally, the deal was the product of 'a gentleman' \u2013 Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2013 seeing his own self-interest after 'a little tough love' in the form of a week of armed conflict.\n\n'American combat troops should not be at the center of ancient sectarian conflict all over the world,' he said. 'Bring our soldiers back home.'\n\nHe then described the American death toll from what he called 'stupid, senseless, endless wars'.\n\nA man who was injured in the ongoing Turkish offensive against Kurdish-controlled areas yesterday.
