(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Fans in Washington and Houston may be excited, but the rest of the country is reacting to the World Series with a collective yawn.\n\nThrough the first five games, the World Series has been averaging 11.6 million viewers, the Nielsen company said. That puts it on pace to be the least-watched Fall Classic ever, although ratings tend to pick up when a series reaches a sixth or deciding seventh game. Game 6 is Tuesday in Houston.\n\nThe previous low point came in 2012, when an average of 12.64 million viewers watched the San Francisco Giants complete a four-game sweep over the Detroit Tigers.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFrom an audience perspective, the Series was really hurt Sunday night, when 18.3 million people watched an NFL game between Green Bay and Kansas City compared to the 11.4 million who tuned into baseball at the same time.
