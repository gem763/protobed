The euro and regional stocks tumbled.\n\n\"The bit that will worry markets is that services that have been largely immune now show signs of substantial contagion effect from the slowdown in manufacturing,\" said Marc Ostwald, global strategist at ADM Investor Services.\n\n\"In terms of today's price action it will put a big old dent in equities and give the whole spectrum of government bonds a boost.\"\n\nAcross the euro zone, 10-year bond yields were down 5 basis points on the day .\n\nGermany's benchmark 10-year bond yield fell to -0.576% -- its lowest level since the Sept. 12 European Central Bank meeting that concluded with rate cuts and fresh asset purchases to boost weak growth.\n\nRishi Mishra, interest rates strategist at Futures First Info Services, said he would not be surprised if the German Bund yield now returned to all-time lows around -0.70%.\n\nA key long-term measure of the market's euro zone inflation expectations fell to just below 1.23% -- its lowest since just before the last ECB meeting.\n\nSpanish bond yields received an additional boost from a credit ratings upgrade after Friday's market close.\n\nSpain's 10-year bond yield was down 6 bps at 0.17% , outperforming euro zone peers.\n\nS&P Global Ratings lifted Spain to A from A-, citing economic resilience and an improving budgetary position and changed the rating outlook to stable from positive.\n\nRival ratings agency DBRS also changed the outlook on Spain's rating to positive from stable, which suggests the next move could be an upgrade. It rates Spain at A.\n\nJim McCormick, global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets, said Spain's average ratings score is now the highest in seven years.\n\n\"Spain\u2019s fundamentals already look more semi-core than peripheral,\" he said. \"Importantly, this is slowly bringing Japanese investors into the market in bigger size.\"\n\nJapanese investors bought a net 33.8 billion yen of Spanish bonds in July according to data from Japan's Ministry of Finance.\n\nOutgoing ECB chief Mario Draghi speaks to the European Parliament later in the day. His comments are likely to be scrutinised closely after the weak PMI data.\n\n(Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Catherine Evans)", "description": "Bond yields across the euro area tumbled on Monday after weaker-than-expected business activity data from the bloc's biggest economies that deepened investors' recession fears.
