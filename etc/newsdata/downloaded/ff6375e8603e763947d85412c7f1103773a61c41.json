Led by the visionary Scottish hotelier, Gordon Campbell Gray, the group \u2013 which both owns and manages hotels \u2013 has a reputation for creating hotels that neither follow or set trends but somehow nail a modern sense of luxury.\n\nTake One Aldwych, which opened in London in the late 1990s, or Carlisle Bay which opened in 2002 in Antigua; both were luxurious and cocooning but in an indefinable way \u2013 like a James Bond smile - whether in their art collection, sleek bedrooms or genuinely warm service.\n\nBoth are no longer part of the group, but Campbell Gray has been busy elsewhere, opening The Machrie in Islay last year, The Merchant House in Bahrain earlier this year followed, in July, by the latest, Hotel Alex, in Zurich, Switzerland. The latter is their first mainland European hotel which is a bit puzzling. Given the group\u2019s high-design, arty profile, why safe-and-steady Zurich and not Milan, say, or Paris? Technically, the hotel isn\u2019t even in Zurich but five miles south on the lakeshore at a rather dull, self-effacing town called Thalwil. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely selective in our brand, so that gives us a lot of constraints,\u201d explains Alan O\u2019Dea, the group\u2019s Managing Director. \u201cWe see nice properties in Paris, Milan, London but,\u201d he pauses tactfully, \u201c\u2026 they\u2019re not quite nice enough.\u201d\n\nMost of the 44 rooms have direct lake views Credit: JAMES MCDONALD More\n\n\u2022 This month's best new hotel openings\n\nWhat piqued their interest with Alex \u2013 which sits on the site of the former 1950s-built Hotel Alexander, and explains the rather unsexy name \u2013 was the potential of a lakeside location. Very few downtown Zurich hotels have a waterside position, points out O\u2019Dea. \u201cAlex has unspoiled views across the lake to the Gold Coast.\u201d The latter is the seriously moneyed, east side of the lake; ask nicely, and someone may point out to you which is Tina Turner\u2019s house.\n\nThe lake plays centre-stage in the design and feel of the hotel. Certainly, the best \u2013 and most fun \u2013 way to arrive is the 20-minute spin across the lake from the city centre in the hotel\u2019s motorboat. Admittedly, first impressions of the hotel are muted: a flat-roof, modernist, rather functional-looking, low-rise building. It\u2019s not until you get closer that you notice the huge lakeside terrace invitingly set with smart tables, the pearly light-reflecting stone (travertine), the big balconies, the big windows. Especially, the big windows.\n\nAll rooms \u2013 bedrooms as well as public rooms \u2013 have floor-to-ceiling windows while the restaurant sits like a glass box jutting out over the lake. (The trick is to get down early for breakfast to bag a window-side table although, rather cleverly, the room is built on three levels to ensure everyone has a chance of a view.)\n\nWhile it\u2019s not quite correct to say the lake is viewable from every part of the hotel \u2013 in some of the entry-level bedrooms, you need to squint sideways \u2013 it\u2019s pretty accurate. The semi-open-plan ground-floor segues from reception through the bar and a couple of semi-enclosed sitting areas, with lake views increasing from glimpses to full-on, and finally tips you out in the full-on lake glare of the Boat House restaurant and its terrace.\n\nIn the distinctive Campbell Gray style \u2013 perhaps more accentuated here, so as not to distract from the lake \u2013 the luxury is low-key but high quality with pale-oak flooring in subtle patterns, chic white-marble tables and Scandi-style furnishings. Colours are pale or nautical-blue, walls lightly textured, curtains gauzy and decorations minimal: fat arty books, a carefully placed bowl of orchids or a ceramic vase on a plinth drawing the eye to the end of a light-flooded corridor. Nothing is over-dressed.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The opening of a new Campbell Gray hotel always causes a stir.
