The amendment offers a path for the commander-in-chief\u2019s removal if the \u201cpresident is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\u201d\n\nBakaj founded the Compass Rose Legal Group, which is representing the central so-called whistleblower on the matter of Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president. Bakaj previously interned for Hillary Clinton and did work for other Democrats.\n\nOn Sunday, Bakaj confirmed that his law firm is representing \u201cmultiple whistleblowers in connection to the underlying August 12, 2019, disclosure to the Intelligence Community Inspector General.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo further comment at this time,\u201d he added.\n\nMark Zaid, senior counsel with the Compass Rose Legal Group, said on Sunday that his firm is representing a second so-called whistleblower in the Ukraine case.\n\nOn Feb 15, 2017, toward the start of Trump\u2019s presidency, Bakaj and the firm each tweeted about the discounted pricing for potential Trump administration informants:\n\nMembers of the IC, @DeptofDefense & @WhiteHouse staff, see stmt re protected v unauthorized disclosures & rate drop. https://t.co/Nyhzoz6pWA \u2014 Compass Rose Legal (@CompassRosePLLC) February 15, 2017\n\nGiven seriousness of the situation,CLG will drop rates for IC + @WhiteHouse staff cntmplating disclosures. Lawyer-up https://t.co/UDSdZ6VqCO \u2014 Compass Rose Legal (@CompassRosePLLC) February 15, 2017\n\nThat same year, Zaid, Bakaj\u2019s partner at the firm, co-founded Whistleblower Aid, a small nonprofit that blasted advertisements around D.C. actively seeking whistleblowers during the Trump administration.\n\nOn Twitter, Bakaj appealed for potential Trump-era whistleblowers to come forward:\n\nIf you're having #securityclearance issues, a #whistleblower, or under investigation, now is not the time to go it alone. Seek counsel! \u2014 Andrew P. Bakaj (@AndrewBakaj) January 23, 2017\n\n\u201cYour loyalty is to the Constitution, not to an individual,\u201d Bakaj and the law firm told U.S. government clients.\n\nCRLG Managing Attny Reminds our clients: Your loyalty is to the Constitution, not to an individual. That is your obligation, per your oath. https://t.co/6PpPhE3YUV \u2014 Compass Rose Legal (@CompassRosePLLC) May 12, 2017\n\nPrior to Trump\u2019s inauguration, Bakaj tweeted that \u201cthe security of the nation rests with career federal employees (DoD, CIA, etc.) doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nThe security of the nation rests with career federal employees (DoD, CIA, etc.) doing the right thing. \u2014 Andrew P. Bakaj (@AndrewBakaj) December 30, 2016\n\nBakaj repeatedly promoted the idea of invoking the 25th amendment to remove Trump from office:\n\n25th Amendment. \u2014 Andrew P. Bakaj (@AndrewBakaj) August 11, 2017\n\nHe is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. That's the standard. 25th Amendment. It says nothing about mental health. https://t.co/BlJRV0Lm1u \u2014 Andrew P. Bakaj (@AndrewBakaj) August 16, 2017\n\nIf it's about restricting access b/c of trust issues, by def. @realDonaldTrump isn't able to discharge the powers and duties of his office. https://t.co/9WDJ7ajPLr \u2014 Andrew P. Bakaj (@AndrewBakaj) August 25, 2017\n\nSec 3 of 25th Amendment says nothing about mental health. It's about @POTUS inability to discharge duties. We are there. \u2014 Andrew P. Bakaj (@AndrewBakaj) August 16, 2017\n\nAt one point, Bakaj called on then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and then-Defense Secretary James Mattis to take cabinet action and invoke the 25th amendment:\n\nTillerson and Mattis could pull together a majority of the cabinet and invoke the 25th. https://t.co/8x4MB2zI3t \u2014 Andrew P. Bakaj (@AndrewBakaj) October 10, 2017\n\nThe activist lawyer referred to the Commander-In-Chief as \u201cPresident Drumpf.\u201d\n\nDriving back to Washington and getting iced #Covfefe near President Drumpf. \u2014 Andrew P. Bakaj (@AndrewBakaj) August 15, 2017\n\nIn 2001, Bakaj interned for both Clinton and Senator Chuck Schumer.\n\nZaid tweeted his firm would represent whistleblowers who believe Trump is a danger:\n\nWe're available to help any one who wants to go that route. @BradMossEsq @AndrewBakaj #1stAmendment works very well when lawyers who know how to weaponize it do so legally to protect #whistleblowers https://t.co/lkXLWwJ8pa \u2014 Mark S. Zaid (@MarkSZaidEsq) March 21, 2018\n\nMeanwhile, missing from the avalanche of news media coverage about the so-called whistleblower clients of Bakaj and Zaid is that at the beginning of Trump\u2019s presidency Zaid co-founded Whistleblower Aid. The group is heavily tied to far-left activist organizations and Democratic politics.\n\nIn his twitter profile, Zaid describes himself as a \u201cnon-partisan\u201d attorney \u201chandling cases involving national security, security clearances, govt investigations, media, Freedom of Information Act, & whistleblowing.\u201d\n\nMissing from Zaid\u2019s twitter profile is that he co-founded Whistleblower Aid. That detail is also not mentioned in Zaid\u2019s bio on his attorney website.\n\nThis even though Whistleblower Aid has been actively helping the first whistleblower also being represented by Zaid by setting up a GoFundMe page seeking to raise funds for the purported whistleblower\u2019s defense. The page already brought in some $210,066 with a goal of raising $300,000.\n\nWhistleblower Aid was founded in September 2017 in the wake of Trump\u2019s presidency to encourage government whistleblowers to come forward.\n\nThe group did not sit around waiting for whistleblowers. Upon its founding, Whistleblower Aid actively sought to attract the attention of Trump administration government employees by reportedly blasting advertisements for its whistleblower services on Metro trains, using mobile billboards that circled government offices for 10 hours a day, and handing out whistles on street corners as a gimmick to gain attention.\n\nWhen Whistleblower Aid was first formed, the main banner for the mission statement of its website contained clearly anti-Trump language.\n\n\u201cToday our Republic is under threat. Whistleblower Aid is committed to protecting the rule of law in the United States and around the world,\u201d read the previous statement which can still be viewed via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.\n\nThat part of the mission statement received attention in the conservative media.\n\nThe sentence \u201ctoday our Republic is under threat,\u201d has since been scrubbed from the website. The mission statement now only reads, \u201cWhistleblower Aid is committed to protecting the rule of law in the United States and around the world.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Washington Post just after Whistleblower Aid\u2019s founding, John Tye, who co-founded the organization with Zaid, claimed, \u201cThis is not a partisan effort,\u201d and then went on to express seemingly partisan alarm about Trump.\n\nTye continued, \u201cAt the same time, yes, the rule of law starts with the office of the president. Like many other people, we are definitely concerned about things that are happening in the administration. The decision to fire [FBI Director] James Comey. The lack of transparency. A lot of people have questions about whether this administration respects the rule of law.\u201d\n\nFar-left ties, Democrat links\n\nZaid doubles as Executive Director and founder of the James Madison Project, which says it seeks to promote government accountability. The Project features on its four-person advisory board John Podesta, who led Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, served as Chief of Staff to Bill Clinton and founded the Soros-funded Center for American Progress pushing a progressive agenda.\n\nWhistleblower Aid co-founder Tye himself is a whistleblower. He is a former State Department official who went public in 2014 about U.S. government electronic surveillance practices.\n\nTye\u2019s bio on Whistleblower Aid\u2019s website brandishes his work for far-left groups.\n\nThe bio reads:\n\nMr. Tye has worked at the Southern Poverty Law Center, Avaaz, and also Southeast Louisiana Legal Services as a Skadden Fellow. He was on the board of directors of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center is known for its anti-conservative stance and controversially publishes a \u201chate map\u201d listing groups that warn about radical Islam such as Jihad Watch, the Clarion Project, the Center for Security Policy. On that same \u201chate map\u201d are racist extremist organizations like Global Crusaders: Order of the Ku Klux Klan and United Klans of America.\n\nTye\u2019s other former employer, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), is financed heavily by billionaire activist and Democratic Party mega-donor George Soros and is known for its hyper-partisan liberal activism.\n\nAvaaz, a radical group where Tye served as campaign and legal director, describes itself as a \u201cglobal web movement to bring people-powered politics to decision-making everywhere.\u201d The group has repeatedly engaged in anti-Israel activism.\n\nChanneling the mantra of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, Avaaz says it aims to \u201corganize citizens of all nations to close the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want.\u201d\n\nAvaaz was founded in 1997 by the Soros-funded, partisan MoveOn.org organization and by the Soros-funded Res Publica activist group.\n\nTax forms from Soros\u2019s Open Society document donations to Res Publica specifically earmarked for support to Avaaz. Res Publica oversees Avaaz activism.\n\nThe same year that Whistleblower Aid was founded, Avaaz\u2019s former general counsel and campaign director, Ian Bassin, in 2017 formed United to Protect Democracy. The latter is a grouping of former top lawyers for the Obama administration working to utilize legal advocacy methods to oppose Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nBassin\u2019s United to Protect Democracy works in partnership with the Brennan Center for Justice, located at NYU School of Law. The Brennan Center is heavily financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations and is the recipient of numerous Open Society grants.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
