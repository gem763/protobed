Peter DeFazio, who chairs the federal transportation committee, said Wednesday the panel plans to pursue legislation with or without the companies\u2019 cooperation. (Reuters)\n\nTalking point: The inquiry is part of lawmakers\u2019 process to regulate the ride-hailing industry amid pushback against the companies\u2019 treatment of workers, as well as its impact on congestion and emissions. In September, employees in Uber\u2019s special investigation unit said they were under pressure to put the company\u2019s interest over passenger safety, and Lyft was recently accused of mishandling sexual harassment reports. The companies have so far resisted regulations. For example, Uber maintains that a California law passed in September that would require app-based companies to give their core workers employee status doesn\u2019t apply to it.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
