The Meme-ing of the Joker.", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Warner Bros.\n\nI have not known peace since I learned who Gary Glitter was. I wish I could go back to a time before Joker, when I had never heard of something called \u201cRock and Roll Part 2\u201d and thought that riff was just the background music for 16 bars of the Jock Jams Megamix. Some early viewers of Todd Phillips\u2019s Joker were surprised to learn that there was a song in it that wasn\u2019t yet another rendition of \u201cSend in the Clowns,\u201d and that the song in question was written by a known pedophile and child molester who is currently serving a 16-year sentence.\n\nOn October 18, Twitter user @sherlwatson tweeted out the Joker stairs dance scene set to \u201cRock and Roll Part 2,\u201d the one that earned the movie a place in the Significant Stairs on Film canon alongside Rocky and The Muppet Show, and compelled fans to make pilgrimages to the \u201cJoker stairs\u201d in the Bronx. Whether Twitter users had seen the film yet or not, we were all familiar with the image of a greasy Joaquin Phoenix in clown paint dancing down a city staircase, ubiquitous as it was on posters and billboards for the film.\n\nthe dance of freedom. the death bells. the rising of the joker.\n\n\n\none of the most magnificent, sublime, monumental, extraordinary scenes in cinema history pic.twitter.com/uczsga2AZQ \u2014 gabriela (@sherlwatson) October 18, 2019\n\n\u201cthe dance of freedom. the death bells. the rising of the joker. one of the most magnificent, sublime, monumental, extraordinary scenes in cinema history\u201d\n\nTo Joker skeptics, there\u2019s something inherently gratifying about finding this type of sincere Joker stanning in the wild, in such hyperbolic language. In @sherlwatson\u2019s spiel, they seem to be reading meaning and depth into a scene that may not have all that much of it. As Daniel D\u2019Addario from Variety pointed out, \u201cthe death bells\u201d is in no world a thing.\n\nthe really weird thing about that Joker tweet is not that it treats Joker as one of the great films of all time (whatever) but that it treats \"the death bells\" as this incredibly common phrase that everyone has heard and intuitively understands \u2014 Daniel D'Addario (@DPD_) October 23, 2019\n\nThe needle drop in this clip is so laughable that some Twitter users who hadn\u2019t seen the movie assumed it was a joke. As Funny or Die editor @cottoncandaddy put it:\n\nthis is literally any commercial for yogurt that helps you shit https://t.co/fOysm2QQId \u2014 sloane (sipihkopiyesis) (@cottoncandaddy) October 22, 2019\n\nSo why did this tweet spawn an unholy legion of dancing Jokers soft-shoeing down your timeline? Part of it is that \u201cthe death bells\u201d is just a fantastically operatic way to describe any video or song you pair it with. Another is that at a time when Film Twitter is taking contentious sides over the artistic legitimacy of superhero films, Joker is a battle line. But mostly? I think it\u2019s just that people like clown memes, and dancing memes, and dancing clown memes.\n\nJoker dancing memes generally come in two flavors. The first is the tried-and-true method of an aural \u201copen for a surprise,\u201d where the scene dubs over with different songs, such as this fire track from our girl Peppa Pig:\n\njoker dancing to bing bong zoo by peppa pig pic.twitter.com/1Z7l1fkodw \u2014 critchy (@ChrissyTiber) October 23, 2019\n\nThe fact of the matter is, \u201cBing Bong Zoo\u201d is only half a step more ridiculous and out of place than the Gary Glitter song in question. There\u2019s nothing lamer, or less anarchic sounding, or countercultural, or just straight-up uncool, than the riff people do the wave to at hockey games.\n\nA much more thematically on-point choice would have been, for example, the Song of Summer, \u201cMisbehavin\u2019\u201d from The Righteous Gemstones. Because nothing says \u201ctwisted menace who doesn\u2019t play by society\u2019s rules\u201d quite like running through the house with a pickle in your mouth.\n\nthe dance of freedom. the death bells. the rising of the joker.\n\n\n\none of the most magnificent, sublime, monumental, extraordinary scenes in cinema history pic.twitter.com/VixBgiigXn \u2014 Jade Budowski (@jadebudowski) October 21, 2019\n\nVibe check:\n\n\"Joker DANCED\ud83d\ude2c? did he do the thumbs and the litle kicks\"\n\n\n\n\"wait u know about this?\" pic.twitter.com/zovWAbLtmk \u2014 Seinfeld Current Day (@Seinfeld2000) October 21, 2019\n\nAnd of course, the song that has every ounce of swagger and foreboding that \u201cRock and Roll Part 2\u201d lacks:\n\njoker dancing to the succession theme pic.twitter.com/YBzgILvWpz \u2014 gina (@chalameche) October 21, 2019\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the other varietal, the Cool Ranch to the dubs\u2019 Nacho Cheese, that takes @sherlwatson\u2019s rapturous, bizarrely worded, entirely misplaced praise and just applies it to different iconic dance scenes.\n\nSuch as Fergie doing one-handed cartwheels while riffing:\n\nthe dance of freedom. the death bells. the rising of the joker.\n\n\n\none of the most magnificent, sublime, monumental, extraordinary scenes in cinema history pic.twitter.com/BdDukcFEdq \u2014 ASAB (assigned sad at birth) (@FeelingFisky) October 23, 2019\n\nOr another highly memed outcast of 2019 cinema, Ma:\n\nthe dance of freedom. the death bells. the rising of the ma.\n\n\n\none of the most magnificent, sublime, monumental, extraordinary scenes in cinema history pic.twitter.com/MNB7myTH92 \u2014 kate\u2019s bush (@iamkatesbush) October 21, 2019\n\nThe rise of Ryan Gosling:\n\nthe dance of freedom. the death bells. the rising of ryan gosling.\n\n\n\none of the most magnificent, sublime, monumental, extraordinary scenes in cinema history pic.twitter.com/NYSEoNrztx \u2014 \ud835\udcc8\ud835\udcb6\ud835\udcce\ud835\udcc3\ud835\udcb6 (@DAREDEVllLS) October 20, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s the Americana at Brand mall-appreciation meme account doing what they do best, which is appreciating the Americana at Brand:\n\nthe dance of freedom. the death bells. the rising of the golden statue.\n\n\n\none of the most magnificent, sublime, monumental, extraordinary scenes in cinema history pic.twitter.com/mOWC6984Qj \u2014 The Americana BAT Brand Memes (@americanamemes) October 23, 2019\n\nSnooki on the boardwalk:\n\nthe dance of freedom. the death bells. the rising of the joker.\n\n\n\none of the most magnificent, sublime, monumental, extraordinary scenes in cinema history pic.twitter.com/Q1PisvC8F2 \u2014 Conor Behan (@platinumjones) October 22, 2019\n\nAnd the most chillingly Joker-like may be this video posted by Ayo Edebiri of Tom Cruise on BET:\n\nthe dance of freedom. the death bells. the rising of the joker.\n\n\n\none of the most magnificent, sublime, monumental, extraordinary scenes in cinema history pic.twitter.com/Tdur7Cp5CU \u2014 Ayo Edebiri (@ayoedebiri) October 22, 2019", "description": "You\u2019ve seen it all over your TL: the meme\u2019d video of the Joker dancing down the stairs to the music of known child molester Gary Glitter.
