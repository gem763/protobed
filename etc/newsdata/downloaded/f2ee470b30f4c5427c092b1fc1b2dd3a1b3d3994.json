Amid furious scenes in the House of Commons, Johnson repeatedly described attempts to block no-deal as the \u201csurrender act\u201d and dismissed a Labour MP\u2019s complaint that his \u201cinflammatory\u201d language risked provoking attacks as \u201chumbug\u201d.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned that the PM\u2019s language was encouraging people to behave in a \u201cdisgraceful and abusive way\u201d.\n\nWhen Cummings was asked if he blamed MPs for the abuse, he replied: \u201cThe MPs said we will have a referendum, we will respect the result and then they spent three years swerving all over the shop.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising some people are angry about it. I find it very odd that these characters are complaining that people are unhappy about their behaviour now and they also say they want a referendum.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf you are a bunch of politicians and say that we swear we are going to respect the result of a democratic vote, and then after you lose you say, we don\u2019t want to respect that vote, what do you expect to happen?\u201d\n\nPM's divisive \u2018surrender bill\u2019 phrase is neither careless nor casual Read more\n\nCummings was also asked if MPs have themselves to blame for the abuse.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way you\u2019re putting it. I am using my language,\u201d he replied, while at a London event marking the launch of a new book by Vote Leave supporter and businessman Stuart Wheeler.\n\nHe said that both leave and remain campaigners have had \u201cserious threats\u201d of violence, which he said should be taken seriously.\n\n\u201cIn the end the situation can only be resolved by parliament honouring its promise to respect the result,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso at the book launch, Cummings painted a picture of calm at Downing Street, despite the PM\u2019s multiple Commons defeats and the supreme court ruling that his prorogation was unlawful.\n\nThe Vote Leave campaign director said: \u201cWe are not under pressure, the referendum was pressure. The referendum was difficult.\n\n\u201cThis is a walk in the park compared to the referendum, we are enjoying this, we are going to leave and we are going to win.\u201d", "description": "PM\u2019s adviser says it\u2019s not surprising people are angry at MPs: \u2018What do you expect?\u2019", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ede67a8da00c4bdfef5a93f73f13949f07c177/474_574_4998_2999/master/4998.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=de6d61fcfbb77f17ded5697b67677a08", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
