(ABBN.EB) reported results for its third quarter earlier today. Here's what you need to know:\n\nPROFIT: Net profit for the period fell to $515 million from $603 million a year earlier, the company said. It beat expectations of $363 million for the quarter.\n\nREVENUE: Revenue for the period fell to $6.89 billion from $7.10 billion the previous year, it said. Analysts expected $6.94 billion.\n\nOPERATIONAL EBITA: Operational Ebita fell to $806 million from $814 million. The company beat another consensus forecast of $792 million, but consensus for this figure had been lowered by 6% recently, according to Citi.\n\nWHAT WE WATCHED:\n\n-SALE & ACQUISITION PROGRESS: ABB's sold power-grids business was reported as discontinued operations in the earnings report. The unit's performance was \"surprisingly weak at $128 million EBIT,\" Morgan Stanley says.\n\n-CAUTIOUS OUTLOOK: As expected, ABB remained cautious, with a mixed outlook for Europe and China and a weakening one for the U.S. The company said it continues to expect a \"slight revenue growth and improved operating margins,\" which could lead to consensus upgrades of margins, UBS says.\n\n-MODERATE GROWTH: ABB's electrification and motion businesses grew in revenue, while robotics and discrete automation as well as industrial automation declined, with the latter negatively impacted by the revaluation of a project. \"Given the magnitude of the recent upcycle, which is ending, we are disappointed by the overall growth performance,\" Morgan Stanley says.\n\nWrite to Kim Richters at kim.richters@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 23, 2019 06:49 ET (10:49 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
