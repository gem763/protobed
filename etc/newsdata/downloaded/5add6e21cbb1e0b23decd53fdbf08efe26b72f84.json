Elizabeth Warren has made an entire political career out of denouncing Big Business, Wall Street, Big Pharma and of late, Big Tech. So, too, most of the rest of the Democrats on the campaign trail and in Congress.\n\nBut America should tread cautiously on ye olde \u201cHate Business\u201d path.\n\nNot only do corporations, obviously, provide jobs that lead to self-sufficiency. But they also bail out plenty in need. They also help keep America free by taking on costly responsibilities that would otherwise fall to Big Government.\n\n\u201c51 Popular Companies That Donate to Nonprofits,\u201d ran one headline from Double the Donation, a site that helps the charity-minded make the most of their financial giving.\n\nAmong?\n\nBank of America has a couple of programs that help those in various needs \u2014 one that matches employees\u2019 charitable contributions, up to $5,000 per year. And there\u2019s another program that provides direct aid to low-income communities.\n\nGeneral Electric has been matching employees\u2019 donations to nonprofits since 1954. The GE Foundation, meanwhile, gives money to causes around the world that foster good health, educational access and entrepreneurship.\n\nGoogle matches employees\u2019 gifts; Google Dot Org donates $100 million each year in grants and another $1 billion in products.\n\nBP gives. Intuit gives. State Street gives. Darden Restaurants gives. McAfee gives.\n\nBest Buy, Starbucks, Chevron, Outerwall, CVS, Kohl\u2019s, Verizon? They all give. There are more, many more.\n\n\u201cJust last year,\u201d Double the Donation reported, \u201cDisney gave over $315 million to nonprofits that help children and families.\u201d\n\nWalmart in September announced $500,000 in cash and donations for Hurricane Dorian victims.\n\nBut that\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared to what else the company donates.\n\n\u201cSince 2007,\u201d the Red Cross wrote on its online donations\u2019 page, \u201cWalmart and its Foundation have donated more than $35 million for disaster preparedness and disaster relief efforts. \u2026 [B]y hosting blood drives \u2026 Walmart and its associates have provided an opportunity for people in the U.S. to give nearly 500,000 blood donations. Each blood donation can help save up to three lives.\u201d\n\nThirty-five million. That\u2019s $35 million of taxpayer funding the Federal Emergency Management Agency didn\u2019t have to give because Walmart did.\n\nYes, Walmart, the very corporation leftists love to hate.\n\nThe very company both Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have denounced in recent weeks \u2014 for the crime, in essence, of making money. For the crime of being successful. How is that even American?\n\nSanders, in June, disparaged the Walton family for the crime of being \u201cthe wealthiest family in America,\u201d with a net worth of $170 billion.\n\nWarren, in April, tweeted this: \u201cThe Walmart heirs make $4 million an hour. A new Walmart associate makes $11 an hour. My two-cent wealth tax on families like the Waltons would help level the playing field for working families and rebuild the middle class.\u201d\n\nNo. What it would really do is raise prices on the consumers and quite possibly, cut into corporate giving.\n\nAnd therein lies the skinny. This is what political condemnations of big business are really all about \u2014 control and power.\n\nBig Government types like Warren and Sanders and the rest on the left like to condemn the wealthy corporate world because it\u2019s easy political punching. It\u2019s easy to point fingers at those supposedly soulless Big Business types who collect millions upon millions of profits on the backs of the hardworking peons they employ \u2014 and pay little.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to give the impression of caring for the little guy, particularly the low-information voting little guy, by pretending to be a man or woman of the people while being whisked from campaign stop to campaign stop by limousine. Or by private aircraft.\n\nAsk Michael Moore, the Hollywood propagandist who habitually pretended poverty and donned hobo dress, all the while banking big bucks from his anti-capitalism movie messages.\n\nThing is, Big Business indeed has its demons. Bernie Madoff, certainly, reached new heights in greed. Executives at Walgreens, Publix, CVS and others, definitely, are trouncing Second Amendment rights by trying to restrict lawful gun owners from openly carrying in their stores \u2014 though honestly, this should draw the left closer to the corporate world, not farther away.\n\nBut if charity helps keep America free \u2014 which it does, because the more the private sector gives, the less the citizens have to turn to government for assistance \u2014 then Big Business absolutely plays a crucial role.\n\nBig Business itself helps keep Americans free.\n\nIf Warren and Sanders and Democrats and leftists truly wanted to help the poor and downtrodden, rather than seize power for themselves, they would stop condemning the very sources that provide for the poor and downtrodden \u2014 the job creators; the charitable givers; the distributors of educational, entrepreneurial, and economic development assistance dollars.\n\nThey would stop pitting Big Business against the very people Big Business so often serves.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
