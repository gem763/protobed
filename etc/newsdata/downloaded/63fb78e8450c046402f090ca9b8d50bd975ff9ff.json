(500209.BY) reported second-quarter results on Friday. Here is what you need to know:\n\nNET PROFIT: The India-based software and services provider reported net profit of 40.19 billion Indian rupees ($566.7 million), compared with INR41.10 billion a year earlier. A poll of analysts by S&P Global Market Intelligence had predicted net profit of INR40.16 billion.\n\nREVENUE: Revenue for the period rose to INR226.29 billion from INR206.09 billion. The analysts' poll had tipped revenue of INR224.98 billion.\n\nWHAT WE WATCHED:\n\n--MARGINS: Infosys' operating profit margin expanded 120 basis points on quarter to 21.7%, helped by an absence of visa and travel expenses and better cost optimization. The management indicated that cost discipline will be the key focus area in coming months with plans for automation and some onsite-offshore rationalization, brokerage Motilal Oswal said.\n\n--CONTRACT WINS: The company's total contract value hit an all-time high of $2.8 billion in the September quarter, but net new deal wins stood at a multi-quarter low of $290 million, brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher said. Total contract value rose 40% on year helped by renewals. \"We continue to believe moderation in demand in financial services, slowdown in manufacturing and weakness in retail vertical will lead to weak demand outlook\" for the remainder of this financial year and the next, it added.\n\n--GUIDANCE: Infosys raised the lower end of its revenue growth guidance for the current fiscal year through March. It now expects revenue to grow 9%-10% in constant currency terms from 8.5%-10% projected earlier. The guidance upgrade is smaller than expected, BOB Capital Markets said. It expected the company's new growth guidance to be 9.5%-10.5%. U.S. bank Jefferies said the company's \"management is being conservative\" as the revenue has grown 11.9% on year in the first half of its fiscal year.\n\nWrite to Saurabh Chaturvedi at saurabh.chaturvedi@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 14, 2019 02:08 ET (06:08 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
