This game features the SEC\u2019s top two rushers in Mississippi State\u2019s Kylin Hill (91 carries, 551 yards, 5 TDs) and Auburn\u2019s JaTarvious Whitlow (82-408-4). Mississippi State\u2019s chances of pulling the upset depend on whether Hill can find running room against a stingy Auburn defensive line featuring Derrick Brown and Marlon Davidson. Brown recorded two sacks and three tackles for loss and also forced a fumble and broke up two passes last week in Auburn\u2019s 28-20 victory over No. 23 Texas A&M;, which was ranked 17th at the time of the game.\n\nMATCHUP OF THE WEEK\n\nMississippi wide receiver Elijah Moore vs. Alabama cornerbacks Patrick Surtain II and Trevon Diggs: Moore is the SEC\u2019s fourth-leading receiver and has 29 catches for 380 yards and three touchdowns. Moore had 11 catches for 102 yards last week in a 28-20 loss to No. 15 California. He faces an even bigger challenge Saturday against second-ranked Alabama\u2019s secondary. Whether Moore is lining up against Surtain or Diggs, he could have a much tougher time getting open.\n\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS\n\nNo. 4 LSU is averaging 57.8 points per game to lead all Football Bowl Subdivision programs. LSU\u2019s 231 points are the most ever by an SEC team through its first four games. \u2026 Alabama has 10 takeaways and just two turnovers to rank second nationally in turnover margin, behind only Boston College. \u2026 Arkansas\u2019 31-24 loss to San Jose State last week dropped the Razorbacks\u2019 record against Group of Five opponents to 2-3 since Chad Morris took over the program last year. Arkansas lost to Colorado State and North Texas last year. \u2026 No. 9 Florida joins Washington State as the only FBS teams that have six players with at least five catches and 100 yards receiving this season. \u2026 Mississippi State and No. 5 Ohio State are the only Power Five teams that have run for 200-plus yards in four games this year. \u2026 Kentucky has won its last five meetings with South Carolina heading into Saturday\u2019s matchup, though the Gamecocks lead the series 17-12-1. \u2026 Texas A&M; will try to beat Arkansas for an eighth straight time Saturday, though Arkansas leads the series 41-31-3.\n\nUPSET WATCH\n\nIt\u2019s tough to pick an upset in the SEC this week. South Carolina\u2019s only favored by two over Kentucky, so it wouldn\u2019t be much of an upset if either team wins that game. And most of the other games taking place this week shape up as likely mismatch. One team on upset alert may be winless Vanderbilt, which is favored by 6 \u00bd over Northern Illinois. Vanderbilt\u2019s the more talented team, but the Commodores\u2019 confidence level could be an issue after they opened the season losing to No. 3 Georgia, Purdue and No. 4 LSU by a total of 70 points.\n\nIMPACT PERFORMER\n\nA defensive tackle rarely leads a conference in sacks, but South Carolina\u2019s Javon Kinlaw is tops through the first four weeks of the season. Kinlaw recorded his fourth sack of the season last week in a 34-14 loss to Missouri. Although Kinlaw was named the co-MVP of South Carolina\u2019s defense along with T.J. Brunson last year, this marks a breakthrough season for the senior from Charleston, South Carolina. He entered the year with 4 \u00bd career sacks and has already nearly doubled that total.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Mississippi State and Ohio State are the only Power Five teams with 200-plus yards rushing in four games.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Here are some things to watch during the fifth week of the Southeastern Conference football season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Megargee"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/kentucky_mississippi_st_football_44286_c0-206-4921-3075_s1770x1032.jpg?e2b56d88622cbb994a2b2cedc0bbc9af5218c8f6", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
