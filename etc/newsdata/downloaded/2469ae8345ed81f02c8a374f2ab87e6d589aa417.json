Its branding and advertising has centered around the idea that cigarettes are bad and JUUL is good. \u201cMake the Switch,\u201d the company encouraged (until a month ago, when the company pivoted away from the slogan in a series of internal decisions). \"We certainly don\u2019t want youth using the product,\" the company said, as it pulled flavors from shelves.\n\nA lawsuit filed this week by Siddharth Breja, a former JUUL executive, makes it seem like the company never actually believed any of its own moral signaling. The lawsuit claims that former JUUL CEO Kevin Burns brushed off concerns that his company was shipping at least a million contaminated pods earlier this year, dismissing his customers as \u201cdrunk\u201d people who \u201cvape like mo-fos.\u201d As BuzzFeed News reports, Breja alleges he was wrongfully terminated in March 2019 for raising concerns about the shipment of bad pods.\n\nAre you a current or former JUUL employee?

According to details from the lawsuit obtained by BuzzFeed News, in February 2019, Breja protested selling pods that were nearly a year old by the time they shipped, and asked the company to at least include an expiration or manufacture date on the packaging. Burns allegedly shot this down, saying, \u201cHalf our customers are drunk and vaping like mo-fos, who the fuck is going to notice the quality of our pods.\u201d\n\nThe answer to that is\u2026 a lot of people. The problem with having an extremely devoted customer base is they tend to be a bit obsessed with the product. Stan culture misses nothing. A smattering of posts from the r/juul subreddit complain of declining pod quality; while these complaints aren\u2019t necessarily related to the shipment mentioned in the lawsuit, they show how dedicated and attentive avid JUULers are. Posts from the subreddit routinely compare clarity of pod juice and complain of anything suspect, like leaking pods or pods that are already brown (signifying age, perhaps) when opened. It\u2019s impossible to speak to the mental state of the people posting about pod quality online, but even if they are, in fact, \u201cdrunk and vaping like mo-fos,\u201d they\u2019re still very much noticing the quality of JUUL\u2019s products.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Hannah Smothers on Twitter.", "description": "\"Half our customers are drunk and vaping like mo-fos, who the fuck is going to notice the quality of our pods.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db9a9b2dc27d70092f41287/lede/1572448937674-GettyImages-1168822427.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8429xh;0xw,0.1264xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
