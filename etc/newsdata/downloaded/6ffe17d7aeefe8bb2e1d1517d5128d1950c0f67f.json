It\u2019s a bit blurry, but at least he\u2019s not camera shy\n\nName: Pete.\n\nOccupation: Plant.\n\nAppearance: Delicate leaves and shiny stalks.\n\nHobbies: Respiration, differential growth, photography.\n\nWait, photography? I thought you said Pete was a plant? He is! He\u2019s a maidenhair fern, of the genus Adiantum, to be precise, He lives at London Zoo, in the Rainforest Life exhibit.\n\nOK. But you said he enjoyed photography? That\u2019s right.\n\nHow is that possible? Don\u2019t try to put limits on what Pete can do. It\u2019s very dehumanising.\n\nDoes he also play boardgames and go to Zumba classes? He does not. Mainly he just grows, photosynthesises and deposits biomatter into the soil around his roots.\n\nThat\u2019s disgusting, Pete! The microbes in the soil don\u2019t think so. They munch it all up and release energy in the process.\n\nDo these microbes have names? Do they play squash? I don\u2019t think so. But the energy they release does slowly charge a super-capacitor. When this is full, it releases enough electricity to operate a digital camera \u2026 which has just made Pete the world\u2019s first plant to take a selfie.\n\nOr a photograph of any kind, I imagine? Yes, I expect so.\n\nPete\u2019s selfie tries to capture his fronds at their best. Photograph: ZSL\n\nWhat\u2019s it like? Well \u2026 it\u2019s a blurry picture of some leaves (see above). But Pete\u2019s doing his best! London Zoo encouraged visitors over the past few months to come and cheer him on.\n\nCome on, Pete! Respire! Deposit that biomatter! That kind of thing? Yes, that kind of thing.\n\nIs Pete doing any interviews? He\u2019s played it cool so far.\n\nVery wise. Too much fame too fast can damage anyone. Although the technology specialist at the Zoological Society of London, Al Davies, is very proud of him.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised! \u201cSeeing Pete\u2019s first selfie was an incredible moment for the ZSL team,\u201d Davies says. \u201cPlugging into plants unlocks the potential to deploy sensors, monitoring platforms, camera traps or other electronics that require power and must operate for extended periods of time \u2013 all remotely and without interference.\u201d\n\nWhy would you want to do that? It allows scientists to record data in remote and shady places without having to replace batteries all the time.\n\nLazy scientists, you mean? That\u2019s right. Although it is valuable work that can help us to understand climate change and habitat loss, and thereby protect plants, fungi, animals and other organisms.\n\nSo Pete\u2019s a humanitarian? Or a plantitarian, I guess.\n\nDo say: \u201cCan I follow Pete on Instagram?\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cIn reality, Pete spends hours posing for those \u2018spontaneous\u2019 snapshots.\u201d", "description": "London Zoo has announced that a maidenhair fern that is part of its Rainforest Life exhibition has taken its own picture.
