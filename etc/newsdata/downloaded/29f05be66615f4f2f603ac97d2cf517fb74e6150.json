This year, whether you\u2019re enthralled with the phone\u2019s new camera capabilities or rather underwhelmed by the lackluster improvements of what\u2019s usually a boundary pushing piece of personal tech, if you do change or upgrade, you will need to consider how to wrap that rascal (unless you\u2019re one of those folks that likes to go naked).\n\nWalking around with \u00a5100,000 worth of tech in your pocket \u2014 whether that\u2019s a bespoke suit, a pair of skinny jeans or yoga-slash-athleisure wear\u2014 warrants at least a minimal protective case that can match your panache. Or better yet, something classic that works well with whatever your chosen style for the day.\n\nOne choice that never goes out of style is supple, functional Italian leather. It elegantly encases your hi-tech and future-forward pinnacle of modern technology. It looks good brand new and gets better looking and more personalized with age and patina and it\u2019s as at home in the boardroom as it is in the local lounge or the fitness studio.\n\n\"Plus, there\u2019s a new color: Alpine Green, inspired by a gorgeous '65 Ferrari 500 Superfast Speziale.\" Mujjo Co-Founder Remy Nagelmaeker\n\nApple usually releases some simple, well-designed leather cases for its devices. Usually. This year, however, the Cupertino company seems to have left new iPhone 11 owners in particular naked and afraid.\n\nNever fear, Mujjo has you covered. We\u2019ve featured this Dutch company before \u2014 it makes top quality leather cases and sleeves for Apple mobile devices as well as warm and stylish touchscreen gloves. A pioneer in the phone case market, the company\u2019s vegetable-tanned, Italian leather mobile phone wallets have won plaudits from the likes of Wallpaper, the Los Angeles Times, Esquire and TechCrunch.\n\nFor the latest iPhone, Mujjo has once again released a case for each model \u2014 the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro (\u00a54,995 \u2013 \u00a55,495) and the iPhone 11 Pro Max (\u00a55,395 \u2013 \u00a55,795) \u2014 that fit like a glove. The new cases are based on the company\u2019s hugely popular iPhone X-series designs: seamlessly wrapped with full-grain leather and durable finishes that get more beautiful with wear. The supple cowhide offers protection from everyday knocks and bumps while adding a \u201cgrippier\u201d feel to your newest sleek, metallic device. The case interiors are lined with the finest Japanese microfiber, a slim, super-strong fabric that is also exceptionally lightweight. Its sophisticated, satin-like finish provides luxurious padded comfort for your iPhone 11.\n\nThe case itself adds very little thickness to the iPhone. The edges are raised by 1 mm around the sides so that your prized OLED screen doesn\u2019t touch the surface when you put it down. The buttons are even covered in leather yet optimized to take nothing away from responsiveness. Openings for the latest camera bulges and mute button are chamfered, adding to the slim aesthetic.\n\nOffered in basic brown or black as well the company\u2019s own unique Monaco Blue and Alpine Green colorways, the Mujjo cases come in plain, card sleeve or leather wallet styles. Besides their refined good looks, the sleeve and wallet versions can hold up to three Suica/Pasmo/credit or ID cards if you\u2019d like to leave your bulky monstrosity of a wallet at home and go minimal. Plus they make a perfect replacement for Apple\u2019s own (nonexistent) iPhone 11 leather cases and sleeves. Now all you need to remember are you keys.\n\nSays Mujjo co-founder Remy Nagelmaeker: \u201cWe've made the cases to live up to our legacy of quality full-leather cases which have consistently been ranked among the best. They're also available as a wallet, a well-known Mujjo original. Plus, there\u2019s a new color: Alpine Green, inspired by a gorgeous '65 Ferrari 500 Superfast Speziale.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s gloves and sophisticated leather cases are available on the Mujjo website (ships worldwide) and Amazon.jp.\n\nExternal Link\n\nMujjo https://www.mujjo.com/\n\n\u00a9 Japan Today", "description": "Like September clockwork, Apple has released the latest iterations of its ubiquitous iPhone: the iPhone 11 series.
