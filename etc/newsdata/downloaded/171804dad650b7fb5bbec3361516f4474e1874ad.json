Breed, File)\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Some of the people rushing to emergency rooms thought the CBD vape they inhaled would help like a gentle medicine. Others puffed it for fun.\n\nWhat the vapors delivered instead was a jolt of synthetic marijuana, and with it an intense high of hallucinations and even seizures.\n\nMore than 50 people around Salt Lake City had been poisoned by the time the outbreak ended early last year, most by a vape called Yolo! \u2014 the acronym for \"you only live once.\"\n\nIn recent months, hundreds of vape users have developed mysterious lung illnesses, and more than 30 have died. Yolo was different. Users knew immediately something was wrong.\n\nWho was responsible for Yolo? Public health officials and criminal investigators couldn't figure that out. Just as it seemed to appear from nowhere, Yolo faded away with little trace.\n\nAs part of an investigation into the illegal spiking of CBD vapes that are not supposed to have any psychoactive effect at all, The Associated Press sought to understand the story behind Yolo.\n\nThe trail led to a Southern California beach town and an entrepreneur whose vaping habit prompted a career change that took her from Hollywood parties to federal court in Manhattan.\n\nWhen Janell Thompson moved from Utah to the San Diego area in 2010, the roommate she found online also vaped. Thompson had a background in financial services and the two decided to turn their shared interest into a business, founding an e-cigarette company called Hookahzz.\n\nThere were early successes. Thompson and her partner handed out Hookahzz products at an Emmy Awards pre-party, and their CBD vapes were included in Oscar nominee gift bags in 2014. In a video shot at a trade show, an industry insider described the two women as \"the divas of CBD.\"\n\nIndeed, Hookahzz was among the first companies to sell vapes that delivered CBD, as the cannabis extract cannabidiol is known. Now a popular ingredient in products from skin creams to gummy bears, cannabidiol was at that time little known and illegal in some states.\n\nThe partners started other brands that offered CBD capsules and edibles, as well as products for pets. Part of Thompson's pitch was that CBD helped treat her dog's tumors.\n\nBy autumn 2017, Thompson and her partner formed another company, Mathco Health Corporation. Within a few months, Yolo spiked with synthetic marijuana \u2014 commonly known as K2 or spice \u2014 began appearing on store shelves around Salt Lake City.\n\nSynthetic marijuana is manmade and can be manufactured for a fraction of the price of CBD, which is typically extracted from industrial hemp that must be farmed.\n\nSamples tested at Utah labs showed Yolo contained a synthetic marijuana blamed for at least 11 deaths in Europe \u2014 and no CBD at all.\n\nAuthorities believed that some people sought out Yolo because they wanted to get high, while others unwittingly ingested a dangerous drug. What authorities didn't understand was its source.\n\nInvestigators with Utah's State Bureau of Investigation visited vape stores that sold Yolo, but nobody would talk. The packaging provided no contact information.\n\nBy May 2018, the case was cold. But it was not dead.\n\nThat summer, a former Mathco bookkeeper who was preparing to file a workplace retaliation complaint began collecting evidence of what she viewed as bad business practices.\n\nDuring her research, Tatianna Gustafson saw online pictures showing that Yolo was the main culprit in the Utah poisonings, according to the complaint she filed against Mathco with California's Department of Industrial Relations.\n\nGustafson wrote that while at Mathco she was concerned about how Yolo was produced, that it was excluded from Mathco's promotional material and that the \"labels had no ingredients or contact listing.\"\n\nJustin Davis, another former Mathco employee, told AP that \"the profit margins were larger\" for Yolo than other products.\n\nGustafson's complaint asserted that Mathco or JK Wholesale, another of the companies that Thompson and her partner incorporated, mixed and distributed Yolo. Financial records in the complaint show Thompson's initials as the main salesperson for Yolo transactions, including with a company in Utah. The records also show Yolo was sold in at least six other states, including to an address in South Carolina where a college student said he vaped a cartridge that sent him into a coma.", "description": "Some of the people rushing to emergency rooms thought the CBD vape they inhaled would help like a gentle medicine.
