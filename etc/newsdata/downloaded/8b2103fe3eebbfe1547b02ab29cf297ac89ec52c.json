People often refer to Apple's OS X operating system and iPhone X as \"oh ess ecks\" and \"iPhone ecks\" \u2014 but Apple thinks of those X symbols like the Latin numeral for 10, thus \"OS ten\" and \"iPhone ten.\"\n\nThat isn't stopping anyone from calling them OS X and iPhone X, of course, and that clearly applies in Sony's case as well.", "description": "The X button on the PlayStation gamepad has been a staple since the controller was introduced in the mid-'90s.
