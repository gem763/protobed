We are facing a tragedy but we will try our best to ensure the rehabilitation of affected people as soon as possible,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\nMahboob Ahmed, a doctor at a village hospital near Mirpur, said they treated 700 people and most of them were later discharged or referred to the district's main hospital, where better health facilities were available.\n\nRaja Qaiser, a deputy commissioner, said rescuers were still transporting victims to hospitals in Mirpur. An emergency was declared in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\n\nHe said a main road near Mirpur was also badly damaged, causing accidents and damaging buses and other vehicles.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw dozens of partially damaged homes along a road leading to Mirpur, where doctors were treating quake victims at open areas outside the city's main government-run hospital due to a shortage of beds.\n\nTV footage also showed cracked roads, damaged homes, shops and vehicles in Mirpur, where a breach at a main canal was submerging villages.\n\nAccording to Pakistan's Meteorological Department, the epicenter of the 5.8 magnitude quake was located near the mountainous city of Jehlum in eastern Punjab province. The earthquake shook walls across the country and left people waiting in the streets fearing aftershocks.\n\n\"The shallow earthquake was 10 kilometers (six miles) deep and that is why it caused so much damage in Mirpur in Kashmir,\" which was not far away from the quake's epicenter, meteorologist Muhammad Riaz said.\n\nMohammad Afzal, chairman of National Disaster Management Authority, said the country's main Mangla Dam located in the region was safe.\n\nResidents in Islamabad were seen rushing out of multistory buildings into the streets.\n\nShortly after the tremor hit, Pakistan's military dispatched troops and medical teams to the quake-affected area to assist civilian authorities in helping victims.\n\nAuthorities said helicopters will also be used if needed to evacuate people from the earthquake-affected area.\n\nSome residents in Mirpur said shortly after the quake struck, they came out of their homes reciting verses from the Quran, Islam's holy book.\n\n\"I was sitting in my shop when suddenly the walls started swaying. I knew that it is a strong earthquake. The moment I came out of my shop, its roof caved in,\" one shop owner told Pakistan's Geo news channel as he stood in a street littered with debris of houses and nearby damaged shops. The shop owner was not identified.\n\nMohammad Arif, whose home was damaged in Mirpur, said when the quake hit, he started shouting to alert his family.\n\n\"God saved me. God saved all of my family members, but our home was partially damaged,\" he told Geo.\n\nPakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Arif Alvi in separate statements expressed their grief over losses caused by the quake.\n\nThe temblor was also felt in the northwest and in many towns and cities in eastern Punjab province, but it caused no damages or casualties there.\n\nA magnitude 7.6 quake in 2005 killed thousands of people in Pakistan and Kashmir.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAhmed reported from Islamabad", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
