The speaker has become a polarizing figure in a country divided sharply along Brexit lines.\n\n[Who is British House of Commons Speaker John Bercow? And why does his resignation matter?]\n\nWith Parliament suspended for the next five weeks, Tuesday\u2019s defeat leaves Johnson with virtually no chance of getting a fresh vote before Oct. 31, the deadline by which Britain is due to leave the E.U.\n\nThe prime minister had hoped an election could restore the majority he lost last week through a combination of defections and ejections and give him a free hand to follow through on his promise to lead Britain out of the E.U. \u2014 even if there\u2019s no deal with European leaders.\n\nInstead, Johnson is in a bind: He has insisted he will not ask the E.U. for an extension \u2014 he said last week that he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch.\u201d But a law passed by rebel lawmakers requires him to seek one if there\u2019s still no deal by Oct. 19.\n\nHard-line Brexiteers have suggested, and Johnson critics have warned, that the prime minister could defy the law. Johnson himself has refused to say he will comply. There is no modern precedent for a British leader willfully ignoring an act of Parliament. To do so would risk being held in contempt of court \u2014 and put in jail. Top ministers insist that will not happen.\n\nAnalysts say Johnson\u2019s best hope may be to strike a slightly improved deal with the E.U. European leaders, however, appear in no mood to give ground, and Johnson may struggle to get any agreement passed in Parliament even if they do.\n\n[Boris Johnson has four options to escape his Brexit mess. One of them is to go to jail.]\n\nThe sudden narrowing of Johnson\u2019s options represents a remarkable turn of events for a prime minister who, less than two weeks ago, appeared to control his own destiny \u2014 and the fate of Brexit.\n\nAs summer waned, he announced a plan to suspend Parliament for much of September and half of October, leaving lawmakers with little time \u2014 perhaps not enough, some theorized \u2014 to block his plans to lead Britain over the cliff of a no-deal Brexit if no agreement could be reached.\n\nBut the formerly fractious opposition quickly unified to disrupt his plans. When he offered an election just two years after the last one \u2014 something opposition leaders had repeatedly demanded \u2014 they turned him down. Along the way, Johnson shed allies, including his own brother, who resigned from the cabinet.\n\nA series of halting public performances added to the sense that Johnson, in office since only late July, had already begun down the path of his two predecessors, David Cameron and Theresa May, who were both casualties of treacherous Brexit politics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that every single defeat and every awkward speech and all the difficulties were part of some master plan to produce a future election victory,\u201d said Tony Travers, a political scientist at the London School of Economics. \u201cBut if you stand back and look at what\u2019s going on, they have, to a degree, lost control of events.\u201d\n\nWhether he can regain that control could hinge on his dealings with Europe in the coming weeks.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Johnson had struck a notably conciliatory tone during a visit to Dublin \u2014 an indication, perhaps, that the prime minister knows his best hope for escaping his Brexit quagmire lies with his European counterparts, who are eager to avoid a chaotic British exit.\n\nStanding beside Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, Johnson insisted again that Britain \u201cwill come out on October 31.\u201d But he also cited a clear preference for a deal to manage the withdrawal and said there is still plenty of time to come to terms before E.U. leaders meet for a summit Oct. 17-18.\n\n\u201cThere is a way forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we really focus, I think we can make a huge amount of progress.\u201d\n\nHe declined, however, to specify new proposals. And Varadkar maintained that he had not seen any.\n\n[Boris Johnson\u2019s statements about the state of Brexit negotiations bear little relationship to reality, E.U. officials say]\n\nThe Irish leader also savaged a favorite Johnson talking point, insisting that a British exit without a deal would lead only to more rounds of negotiation \u2014 not to an end to Britain\u2019s Brexit agony.\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a clean break,\u201d Varadkar said as Johnson grimaced.\n\nA joint statement following the news conference and a subsequent hour of meetings said that \u201ccommon ground was established in some areas although significant gaps remain.\u201d\n\nThe question of how to handle the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland, which will remain a member of the E.U., has bedeviled Britain\u2019s Brexit plans from the start \u2014 and will be key to talks in the coming weeks.\n\nBoth the British and Irish governments say they don\u2019t want a hard border, complete with checkpoints and barriers, dividing the island. But the Irish, and the E.U., have insisted on a \u201cbackstop\u201d that would in effect keep Britain in the E.U.\u2019s customs union until a solution can be found that allows for two trading systems to exist side by side.\n\nJohnson has rejected such an arrangement, saying it would keep Britain from striking deals with other countries, such as the United States, and reaping the benefits of life outside the E.U.\n\nIf there are benefits to be had, they remain stubbornly elusive three years after a majority of Britons voted in a referendum to exit the E.U.\n\nWith the country still polarized along Brexit lines, polls show Johnson\u2019s Conservatives with a significant lead over the opposition Labour Party. Whenever an election comes \u2014 analysts say November is now likely \u2014 the prime minister is expected to play on frustration among pro-Brexit voters who blame Corbyn and other opposition leaders for the country\u2019s inability to get out.\n\nBut with multiple choices for both the pro- and anti-E.U. side on the ballot, any election is highly unpredictable.\n\n[Phillip Lee defied Boris Johnson. Now the prime minister\u2019s party is gunning for his seat, with Brexit on the line.]\n\nJust how polarized Britain has become was evident Monday afternoon with the surprise announcement by Bercow, the colorful and controversial speaker of the House of Commons, that he would leave his post by the end of October.\n\nKnown for his enthusiastic shouting of \u201cOrder! Order!\u201d his loud ties and his soaring oratory, Bercow is a cult figure in the Brexit drama.\n\n[Order! Order! The sharp-tongued speaker of the House of Commons is changing the rules \u2014 and maybe Brexit.]\n\nHe is also a stalwart defender of parliamentary power, one who used his traditionally low-key and nonpartisan role to ensure that lawmakers could effectively check executive power at a time when critics say Johnson is flouting important conventions of the British political system.\n\nThat stance was significant last week, with Bercow giving lawmakers the chance to block Johnson\u2019s attempts to take Britain out of the E.U. without a deal.\n\nMost lawmakers gave Bercow a standing ovation on Monday \u2014 a rare display on the House floor. But many hard-line Brexiteers, who believe Bercow is biased toward the pro-E.U. camp and had vowed to try to defeat him in the next election, stayed seated.\n\nIn an emotional farewell address, with his wife looking on from the gallery, Bercow pleaded for an institution that is taking heavy abuse as frustration with Britain\u2019s interminable E.U. exit builds \u2014 and is likely to take more.\n\n\u201cWe degrade this Parliament at our peril,\u201d he said.\n\nFerguson reported from Dublin.\n\nRead more\n\nHe defied Boris Johnson.
