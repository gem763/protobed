The judgments relate to an illegal bid by the former Catalan government to declare independence from Spain two years ago.\n\nWhile separatist parties have a slim majority in the Catalan parliament, polls show support for independence is shared by less than half the population.\n\nProtests on Tuesday lacked the intensity of events Monday when crowds blocked roads and laid siege to Barcelona airport.

A crowd of as many as 40,000 gathered in Barcelona, the newspaper said, citing police estimates.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Charles Penty in Madrid at cpenty@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at cthomas16@bloomberg.net, Robert Jameson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Josep Borrell, Spain\u2019s acting foreign minister, accused Catalan separatist leaders of acting in a \u201ctotalitarian\u201d way as protests continued at the jailing of former officials who plotted a bid for independence in 2017.When Catalonia\u2019s secessionist president, Joaquim Torra, claims to be", "authors": ["Charles Penty"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dPrFkMCyb4nwCo.yyMzIlg--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/e66a56d15a5d0ea257200a31a24c819b", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
