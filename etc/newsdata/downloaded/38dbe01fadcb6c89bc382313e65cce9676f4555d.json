Instead, he cast the impeachment fight in more basic terms \u2014 a battle between him and what he calls the \"swamp\" in Washington.\n\n\"They want to erase your vote like it never existed,\" Trump told the capacity crowd.\n\n\"They want to erase your voice, and they want to erase your future.\"\n\nWhat the Republican described as an \u201cinsane impeachment witch hunt\" was doomed to failure, he said, and would \"produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before.\"\n\nTrump's supporters revelled in the Republican president's angry and energised performance. [Leah Millis/Reuters]\n\nInsults and anger\n\nIn the American heartland, the Minnesota city is represented by Democrat Ilhan Omar, an American of Somali descent.\n\nTrump tore into Omar and other political opponents, calling the congresswoman \"a disgrace\" and an \"America-hating socialist.\"\n\nHe said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was \"really stupid\" and insulted Biden.\n\nAt his rally just now, Trump called me an \u201cAmerica-hating socialist\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d He shouted xenophobic conspiracy theories about me. He scolded my district for voting for me.\n\n\n\nHis hate is no match for our movement.

Lock him up! Lock him up!\" in reference to Trump himself.\n\nSome brought helium-filled balloons depicting Trump as a baby, similar to the giant Baby Trump balloon that flew above a nearby building.\n\nLora Torgerson clutched a sign that read \"Liar Liar Diaper on fire.\"\n\n\"I'm a registered GOP member, and I've never been more ashamed of our party,\" she said. \"I didn't vote for him.\"\n\nProtesters outside the campaign rally carried 'Baby Trump' balloons and shouted 'Lock him up! Lock him up!' in reference to the president. [Jim Urquhart/Reuters]\n\n'Ridiculous'\n\nInside the arena, Lori Glass, a longtime Republican dismissed the talking of impeachment with one word: \"Ridiculous.\"\n\n\"He's done so much for the country,\" she said, citing the economy as Trump's top accomplishment and claiming the Democrats were pressing for impeachment because they didn\u2019t have a \u201cgood candidate\".\n\nWhile the president has pushed back against the inquiry, refusing to cooperate and seeking to turn the entire scandal into a boost for his re-election campaign, public support for impeachment appears to be growing.\n\nA new poll from Fox News -- a channel favoured by US conservatives -- showing 51 percent now back his removal from office.\n\nWith control of the lower house of Congress, Democrats are likely to impeach in the coming months, even if few believe the Republican-led Senate will actually convict Trump and force him from office.\n\nTrump argues that his call with Zelensky did not feature any kind of pressure, but was an innocent proposal for pursuing corruption.\n\nHe got a boost Thursday when Zelensky backed his version of events, telling journalists \"there was no blackmail.\"\n\n'Shooting holes'\n\nDemocrats say that given the vast power differential between the two leaders, Trump did not need to make explicit threats and that his request to Zelensky for \"a favour\" was enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden gave a blistering speech in which he called for impeachment, accusing Trump of \"shooting holes in the constitution.\"\n\nOn Thursday, two Florida-based businessmen linked to Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani -- who is at the heart of the controversy -- were arrested over alleged campaign finance violations.\n\nThe pair, Americans born in Ukraine and Belarus, were accused of funnelling foreign funds to US political campaigns, including $325,000 which went to a fundraising committee for Trump's 2020 re-election.\n\nTrump, who has been photographed with both men, said he had no idea who they were. \"I don't know about them. I don't know what they do. I don't know,\" he told reporters.", "description": "President rallies the faithful at Minneapolis rally insulting opponents and vowing to win in 2020.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/11/8160c50c536b4ac88dff7f37781dad3a_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
