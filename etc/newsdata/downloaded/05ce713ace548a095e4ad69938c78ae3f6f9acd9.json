That sweet boy followed close behind me wherever I went, especially when it was time to prep dinner. He was never interested in watching a show while I cooked; he\u2019d rather be with me \u2014 as close as physically possible \u2014 as I moved from the dining room to the kitchen, from the refrigerator to the sink, from the sink to the stove.\n\nIt was endearing but also stressful when things like pots of boiling pasta were involved. He and I both would have loved this idea from Susie Allison at Busy Toddler:\n\nHer idea is to write letters with dry erase markers on a sliding glass door or large window, hand the kid a towel and call out, \u201cErase the K! Erase the first letter in the word \u2018cow!\u2019 Erase the last letter in your name!\u201d When they run out of letters, write them again, rinse and repeat.\n\nYou\u2019re connecting with them without being physically attached and they\u2019re practicing their letters. This is an activity that can grow with the child, too. The ABC Erase game would be great for kids ages 2-4(ish). For older kids, use it to practice sight words or simple maths equations. Or let siblings play a few rounds of Tic-Tac-Toe on a rainy day.\n\nOnce they\u2019re old enough (trustworthy enough), you can hand over the markers and walk away. I recently gave my stash of dry erase markers to my nine-year-old and asked him to decorate our dining room windows for Halloween. I came back later to a haunted house scene that included this jaunty little devil:\n\nI\u2019m sure the neighbours will love him.
