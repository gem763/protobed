Aguilar believes the vandalism happened because of the pro-2nd Amendment stickers on his ride.\n\n\u201cI would never expect anyone to have that hostility towards somebody just expressing their opinion,\u201d Aguilar said. Aguilar is a big supporter of the second amendment and isn\u2019t afraid to show it. One of his bumper stickers says \u201cControl your kids, not our guns.\u201d \u201c[I\u2019m] just kind of perplexed that people would think that you\u2019re a killer just because you are for guns; that\u2019s not really what guns is about,\u201d Aguilar said.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Aguilar couldn\u2019t park on campus, so he ended up in a neighborhood not far away. It\u2019s entirely possible that the vandal, whoever it was, wasn\u2019t a college student at all. It\u2019s also entirely possible it was a college student. CBS Sacramento had no problem finding one student who took offense to Aguilar\u2019s bumper stickers.\n\nChris Lau said the stickers are easily offensive, specifically referring to one that read \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in the right to keep and bear arms, shut up and be a good victim.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s basically a threat..you\u2019re telling them hey you better watch out. I see that as a threat,\u201d Lau said.\n\nOh come on now. The message of the sticker is clearly \u201cif you don\u2019t support the right to keep and bear arms, good luck fighting back if you\u2019re ever attacked\u201d, not \u201cI will victimize you for not supporting the 2nd Amendment.\u201d But if one student is offended, I guarantee there are others.\n\nMeanwhile, Aguilar says the car\u2019s being repainted and will soon look as good as new, though he is making one change.\n\nAguilar is working on getting his car repaired. He said he also gets positive feedback for his stickers, but after all this, he\u2019s planning on standing down. \u201cI plan on taking them off because I don\u2019t want any more problems; I don\u2019t want any more negative views,\u201d Aguilar said.\n\nI think it\u2019s sad that he\u2019s taking the stickers off his car, but I can\u2019t necessarily blame him. A few years ago, after my wife and purchased our small farm in central Virginia, I spent about 18-months working in the DC-area and commuting home on the weekend. I rented a small bedroom in a townhouse in Alexandria to sleep in during the week, and I too worried about my pro-2A stickers, wondering if I would be the target of a break-in or vandalism in the deep-blue suburb of Washington, D.C. Ultimately it was a non-issue; the stickers stayed and my car was untouched, but not without some internal debate on my part.\n\nI decided that if someone was going to deface my vehicle just because they didn\u2019t like the thoughts expressed on a bumper sticker, I\u2019d rather deal with that when the time came rather than silence myself because I was concerned about the tolerance (or lack thereof) in the neighborhood. It worked out all right for me, but not so much for Jose Aguilar.", "description": "The war on speech continues in California, and the latest casualty is California college student Jose Aguilar's Nissan Versa, which now has the words \"killer\" and \"bitch\" keyed into the paint.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://bearingarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sacstate.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
