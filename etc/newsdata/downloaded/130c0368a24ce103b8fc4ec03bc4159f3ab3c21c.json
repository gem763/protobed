Thousands gathered in the surrounding streets chanting: \u201cThe streets will always be ours!\u201d\n\nPolice struggled to control the situation, firing rubber bullets, teargas and, later in the night, a water cannon was deployed against demonstrators for the first time since it was bought from Israel in 1994.\n\nNew generation, new tactics: the changing face of Catalan protests Read more\n\nOfficers from both national and regional forces have been criticised for their heavy-handed actions and a journalist from El Pa\u00eds was arrested while covering Friday\u2019s skirmishes. Other members of the Spanish media have been intimidated and targeted by some independence supporters.\n\nFifty-four people were arrested and 182 received medical treatment on Friday night.\n\nAda Colau, the mayor of Barcelona, said the violence could not continue. She criticised both the throwing of objects by protesters and the police\u2019s use of rubber bullets as well as \u201cthe attacks on media professionals\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cUnfortunately, we endured some very serious moments of violence last night in a peaceful city that believes in dialogue.\u201d\n\nThe city council says the violence this week has cost the city more than \u20ac2m (\u00a31.7m) \u2013 much of it lost by the burning of more than 1,000 rubbish bins. Many Barcelona residents woke up on Saturday to find there was no where to put their garbage.\n\nHundreds of council workers were on the streets on Saturday trying to clean up from the previous night.\n\nSpain\u2019s interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, travelled to Barcelona on Saturday to meet his Catalan counterpart and to visit national police officers injured in Friday\u2019s violence.\n\nThe march that had preceded the unrest had been overwhelmingly peaceful. According to Barcelona police, about 525,000 people congregated in the city, many of them having marched there from around Catalonia.\n\nA radical movement of young Catalan separatists, Arran, has called for a new demonstration \u201cagainst repression\u201d in central Barcelona on Saturday afternoon.\n\nQ&A What do the lengthy Catalan sentences mean?

Spain is due to hold its fourth general election in as many years on 10 November.\n\nAlthough S\u00e1nchez has taken a more conciliatory approach to the Catalan question than his predecessor, he has ruled out any referendum on Catalan independence and insisted any negotiations will have to respect the Spanish constitution, which stresses the \u201cindissoluble unity\u201d of the country.", "description": "Quim Torra urges dialogue for democratic solution to tensions following fifth consecutive night of violence", "authors": ["Stephen Burgen", "Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d476724505d604254284f0243161f8afefa4b7b/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1719bd5730901f12d6201d428a3c18c2", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
