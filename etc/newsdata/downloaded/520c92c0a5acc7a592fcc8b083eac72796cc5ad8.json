Insurgent violence had intensified as U.S. negotiators said they were nearing an agreement. American politicians, military figures and diplomats had warned that a bad deal aimed primarily at removing U.S. troops from the country could lead to disaster.\n\n\u201cThere is definitely a silver lining to this. There was total confusion before,\u201d said Haroun Mir, a Kabul-based analyst. \u201cEveryone was afraid the U.S. would sign a cease-fire but the Taliban would continue their war against the Afghan government and people. Now President Trump has personally rectified this with his own tweet.\u201d\n\nFew Afghans had trusted the closed-door process from the beginning, fearing that the U.S. government would make too many concessions to the insurgents, giving them free rein to return to extremist Islamic rule and allowing Afghan democratic rights and personal freedoms to be sacrificed.\n\nPresident Ashraf Ghani, who had fumed for months about being excluded from the talks, prepared to fly to Washington this weekend without public explanation, but the trip was then postponed. Most observers here had assumed he was going to express his concerns about the proposed peace settlement.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump in Biarritz, France, Aug. 26, 2019. (Christian Hartmann/Reuters)\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet, however, disclosed that a secret meeting had been in the works that would bring Taliban leaders face-to-face with Ghani and his senior aides. He tweeted that he had canceled it due to the most recent Taliban attack Thursday, a bombing near the U.S. Embassy here that killed 10 Afghans, one U.S. service member and one Romanian soldier. It was not clear whether Taliban leaders had agreed to the meeting or not.\n\nOn Sunday, Ghani\u2019s government quickly welcomed Trump\u2019s announcement, saying it coincided with official concerns here that the Taliban were manipulating the peace process and reiterating the government\u2019s long-standing insistence that only direct bilateral talks between Afghan and Taliban leaders could bring about an enduring and substantive settlement.\n\nSediq Sediqqi, the chief spokesman for Ghani, said Trump\u2019s decision \u201cshowed he has a proper understanding of the situation and sees that the Taliban are not committed to peace.\u201d He added that the government was grateful to the United States for its efforts, but that now the Taliban must \u201cstop killing Afghans and agree to negotiate directly with the Afghan government. We have always been behind a meaningful peace process and we will always be the implementer of that process.\u201d\n\n[Trump says he canceled secret meeting with Afghan president, Taliban at Camp David]\n\nBut later Sunday, at a news conference, Sediqqi said direct talks among Afghans could not begin any time soon because of ongoing attacks. \u201cWe do not have conditions for talks, but peace has conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cHow is it possible to sit in talks and continue the violence?\u201d He said the Taliban had been enjoying a \u201choneymoon\u201d in Qatar while \u201ccheating Afghanistan and the world. This needs to come to an end.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfghan security officials stand guard on a road side as security has been intensified during the sacred month of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic Calendar, in Herat, Afghanistan, Sept. 8 2019. (Jalil Rezayee/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nSeveral of Ghani\u2019s rivals in a presidential election scheduled for Sept. 28 expressed similar comments after offering to quit the race if needed in the interests of peace. Many Afghans have called for the polls to be postponed, but Sediqqi said they would still be held on schedule. Ghani has been running hard for reelection to a five-year term despite Taliban threats to attack the polls.\n\n\u201cIt is time for the Taliban to step forward, stop the bloodshed, announce a cease-fire and start direct talks with the Afghan side,\u201d said Rahmatullah Nabil, a candidate and former national intelligence chief.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from the Taliban to Trump\u2019s statement, but late Saturday night a spokesman for the group based in Qatar, where the U.S.-Taliban talks have been held, sent out a tweet hinting at fatal problems with the talks and indicating that the group would seek other avenues for negotiations among Afghans.\n\n\u201cSo far there has not been a settlement of the interstate talks. There may be numerous inter-Afghan talks in different countries,\u201d spokesman Sohail Shaheen tweeted. \u201cThere has not been a decision where to go next.\u201d In a separate tweet he said \u201cthere is enmity with the ongoing peace process,\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate indication that the insurgents would stop or slow their attacks, which have killed scores of people in the capital and across the country in suicide bombings and ground assaults during the past two weeks. Some analysts warned that the insurgents might even intensify their attacks in the wake of Trump\u2019s sudden change of policy.\n\nThere were reports Sunday that the Taliban had stepped up attacks in northern Kunduz and Baghlan provinces, possibly blocking a major highway to Kabul. The insurgents, who are based in the Afghan south, launched offensives in both strategic provinces over the past two weeks, likely seeking leverage at the now-cancelled talks.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement came just before a week of public religious observances and political events that could be targets for further violence. Monday is the death anniversary of Ahmad Shah Massoud, the anti-Taliban militia leader who was assassinated in 2001. Tuesday is the emotional peak day of Muharram, a Shiite religious mourning period, when Shiite mosques and communities have been attacked in previous years.\n\n\u201cA lot of Afghans are happy about Trump\u2019s tweets because they may stop a bad deal with the Taliban, but they ignore the fact that there is a fundamental lack of strategy in Afghanistan that could prolong and exacerbate the bloody conflict,\u201d tweeted Haroun Rahaimi, a law instructor at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul. \u201cI fear for what may come next!\u201d\n\nSome prominent Afghans took a hard line against the Taliban Sunday, saying the insurgents should never be forgiven for their wanton attacks on civilians, and that they had used the bilateral peace process as an excuse to show military might, while never abandoning the desire to return to power.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban were never interested in peace \u2026 they just kept killing people indiscriminately to get a stronger bargaining position,\u201d tweeted Raihana Azad, a member of parliament from Daikundi province. \u201cNow the government should ask for the extradition of the Taliban based in Qatar. They should stand trial for all the atrocities they have committed.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s Ghani to visit Washington as peace deal limps and violence surges\n\nAfter Taliban bomb kills civilians, Afghans call for foreign compound to be closed\n\nAs U.S.-Taliban deal nears, Afghanistan\u2019s Ghani hardens resolve to hold elections on time\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Supporters of the Afghan government have long been deeply uneasy with the Taliban peace talks.", "authors": ["Pamela Constable", "Foreign Correspondent Covering Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "South Asia", "Latin America", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OpR5jJg7v493CW3X4maWquq92n0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/23G5RAGSEYI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
