Though he remains in the concussion protocol, the big picture outlook for Rudolph\u2019s recovery looks promising. It\u2019s harder to say the same about his team\u2019s season.\n\nThough Devlin Hodges filled in capably after Rudolph exited in the third quarter on Sunday - twice leading the Steelers on go-ahead scoring drives - JuJu Smith-Schuster\u2019s overtime fumble helped the Ravens escape with a 26-23 victory and left Pittsburgh at 1-4 heading into a visit to the Los Angeles Chargers next weekend.\n\nSave for a Week 1 blowout in New England, the Steelers have been competitive regardless of who is at quarterback regardless of their pedigree. Their past three losses are by a combined nine points, and in two of them they led deep into the fourth quarter. Yet they were unable to close out San Francisco and Baltimore, done in by a series of self-inflicted mistakes.\n\nSmith-Schuster\u2019s fumble off a well-timed strip by Baltimore\u2019s Marlon Humphrey set up the winning score on Sunday. It was similar to what happened in San Francisco in Week 3, when James Conner\u2019s fumble deep in Pittsburgh territory allowed the 49ers to somehow survive on a day they gave it away five times.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the Steelers haven\u2019t been good. They just haven\u2019t been quite good enough, even after the defense responded to coach Mike Tomlin\u2019s decision to kick off in overtime against the Ravens rather than take the ball. Baltimore went nowhere and punted, just as Tomlin planned. It was a massive vote of confidence for a unit that began the year as a major question mark. The time, however, for moral victories has come and gone.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no solace in that because all we\u2019re worried about is outcomes,\u201d defensive tackle Cam Heyward said. \u201cWe don\u2019t care if it\u2019s ugly, pretty, as long as we get a winning outcome. We\u2019re going to circle the wagons and get better.\u201d\n\nAnd they might have to do it - for the time being at least - with a 23-year-old quarterback from Kimberly, Alabama (population 3,173) who was brought in as a \u201ccamp\u201d arm in the offseason and now finds himself as the most likely option if Rudolph isn\u2019t cleared in time to face the Chargers.\n\n\u201cI feel like I know the offense,\u201d said Hodges, who completed 7 of 9 passes for 68 yards and also added a 21-yard scramble. \u201cI just went out there and executing when depending on what play is called. I have always been a guy who is aggressive in throwing the ball and what not.\u201d\n\nHodges played with a fearlessness he\u2019ll need to rely on if he walks onto the field with the starters in Los Angeles. Whatever margin for error the Steelers had is now gone.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe defense sacked Lamar Jackson five times and created three more takeaways, exactly the kind of splash plays the Steelers focused on during the offseason. Pittsburgh has created 12 turnovers in five weeks, just three fewer than it created all of last year.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nFor as solid as the defense looked over the last 40-plus minutes against Baltimore, it was just as shaky over the first 20 minutes as the Ravens raced to a 17-7 lead. Linebacker Bud Dupree chalked it up to communication issues that plagued the Steelers early in the season. The issues were ironed out eventually, but asking an offense still trying to figure things out to claw out of multiple 10-point deficits is a dangerous habit to get into.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nSafety Kam Kelly looked to be overmatched when he was thrust into the starting lineup in the opener against New England. Things have slowed down considerably over the past month. Now playing exclusively in sub packages rather than starting, Kelly picked up his first NFL interception when he got his hands on Jackson\u2019s pass in the second quarter.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nLife comes at you fast in the NFL. Look no further than Jaylen Samuels for proof. The running back\u2019s play while working out of the wildcat in a romp over Cincinnati last Monday helped the Steelers roll to a 24-point win. Sunday, he was a non-factor. He collected just 17 yards of total offense and an ill-advised pass attempt out of the wildcat gave the Ravens the ball deep in Pittsburgh territory.\n\nINJURED\n\nWide receiver James Washington\u2019s left arm was in a sling on Monday. Washington injured his shoulder while catching a 26-yard pass on the play Rudolph was drilled by Thomas.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n1 - The number of times in Pittsburgh\u2019s past 12 games the Steelers have gone over 100 yards rushing dating back to last season. Pittsburgh is 4-8 over that span.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nHope the spark Hodges showed while filling in for Rudolph wasn\u2019t a mirage. Pittsburgh has struggled on the West Coast recently but beat the Chargers in San Diego in 2015 in a game in which Michael Vick started in place of Roethlisberger.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mason Rudolph ambled through the Pittsburgh Steelers locker room on Monday, a welcome sight less than 24 hours removed from a harrowing collision with Baltimore safety Earl Thomas that left the second-year quarterback lying unconscious on the Heinz Field turf.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Will Graves"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/ravens_steelers_football_96422_c0-126-3000-1875_s1770x1032.jpg?85e3f3a90d2b6cb216aa7875ca9e51bf768c5416", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
