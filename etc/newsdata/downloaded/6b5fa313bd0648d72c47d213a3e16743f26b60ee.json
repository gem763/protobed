According to Vogue, the royal couple touched down at the Pakistani Air Force Base Nur Khan in Chaklala, Rawalpindi, Punjab, where William wore a suit with a royal blue tie while Kate wore what looked to be a long dress and pants, similar to the traditional shalwar kameez, also know as a churidar or kurta.\n\nPrincess Diana wore a similar outfit, complete with the buttons on the sleeves, when she visited a hospital in Lahore in 1996 \u2013 and the resemblance is striking.\n\nSEE THE PHOTOS HERE:\n\n(1996 and 2019: Princess Diana and Duchess Kate.

She eventually accepted the invitation, and although she travelled to Pakistan many times, it was her trip just before her tragic death that made headlines.\n\nPrincess Diana was famously pictured holding a blind and gravely sick seven-year-old boy at a cancer hospital who had weeks to live.\n\n(1996: Princess Diana on her last visit to Pakistan.
