That information has been added to the article.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions \u2013 but played the game badly. They should be sued!\u201d\n\nMr Trump also tweeted a quote from Fox & Friends contributor Dan Bongino: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to Justice Kavanaugh is a disgrace. This guy is not a good man, he is a great man. He has to go to his church with his family while these terrible reports are being written about him, a disgrace!\u201d\n\nHe appeared to be referring to the media as well as Democrat politicians, who have used the latest revelations to call for Mr Kavanaugh to be impeached.\n\nAnother tweet read: \u201cThe New York Times walks back report on Kavanaugh assault claim. @foxandfriends The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh \u2013 assaulted by lies and fake news! This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner, the Dems.\u201d\n\nThe new allegations of Mr Kavanaugh\u2019s behaviour have raised significant questions about how much the FBI investigated him when he was being considered for the Supreme Court. Led by senator Elizabeth Warren, all frontrunners in the Democratic primary have now called for Mr Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment, with the exception of Joe Biden.\n\nMr Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings were a bleak moment in recent American history, during which the now Supreme Court Justice became increasingly furious about the allegation that he had assaulted Christine Blasey Ford. He was confirmed in the closest vote on a Supreme Court appointee in 130 years.", "description": "Donald Trump\u00a0has tweeted an angry\u00a0defence of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u00a0over fresh sexual misconduct\u00a0allegations, as pressure to impeach the controversial judge continues to build.", "authors": ["Lily Puckett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/31/13/trump-2018-year-31.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
