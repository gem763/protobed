It is their actions that matter. In all cases, you\u2019d be better off being represented by a sack of potatoes, or a tub of lard.\n\nEven a particularly dim King Edward or Maris Piper would not be ignorant and rash enough to think that the decriminalisation of drugs was a good idea, as these MPs \u2013 members of the Health and Social Affairs Committee \u2013 said it was in a \u2018report\u2019 last week.\n\nThere is hardly a voice to be heard, either in Parliament, or the BBC, or in most major newspapers, against this literally mad policy of permitting the free use of terrible mind-destroying, family-destroying poisons [File photo]\n\nLook, our drug possession laws have not been enforced for decades. They cannot be the cause of the problem. And drug abuse is a voluntary crime, not a compulsory disease, as these fools constantly pretend. All its consequences were freely chosen by the abuser. Cancer sufferers would love to be able to give up having cancer. But they cannot.\n\nI have read the document they grandly call a report. I doubt they even know the arguments against the fashionable surrender position which they took and endorsed.\n\nI strongly suspect they do not know that Japan and South Korea, law-governed democracies and among the most advanced societies on earth, successfully reduce and prevent drug use by enforcing their laws against drug possession.\n\nMaybe they were gulled by the racialist argument that these countries have a different \u2018culture\u2019 from us. In fact they have pretty much the same culture as this country had before the drug lobby got to work here in the late 1960s.\n\nLook, our drug possession laws have not been enforced for decades. They cannot be the cause of the problem. And drug abuse is a voluntary crime, not a compulsory disease, as these fools constantly pretend [File photo]\n\nBut, of course, they focus on Portugal, the supposed drug paradise, where the drug laws (though feeble) are on paper significantly tougher than here (drug abusers can have their passports taken away and be banned from pursuing their professions, as well as facing significant fines).\n\nThere they saw what they wanted to see, which did not include a 40 per cent increase in the use of marijuana since decriminalisation in 2001.\n\nI wonder if they were given pause when, on September 30, Rui Moreira, the mayor of Porto, Portugal\u2019s second biggest city, made a startling U-turn on the issue. He called for the reintroduction of criminal penalties for drug use in public spaces.\n\nDid they make any serious effort to find out about any opposition to decriminalisation? Would it have helped if they had?\n\nI rather doubt it. The problem goes deeper than knowledge.\n\nA few years ago I and some allies tried to state the anti-drug, pro-enforcement case to the Home Affairs Committee of the House of Commons, who at least had the manners and sense to invite witnesses who might not agree with what I am sure they were already planning to say. It was as close as I have ever come to a mystical experience.\n\nI strongly suspect they do not know that Japan and South Korea, law-governed democracies and among the most advanced societies on earth, successfully reduce and prevent drug use by enforcing their laws against drug possession [File photo]\n\nAs I spoke to these lawmakers, I was both in the room and not in it. I provided the fruits of years of research on actual drug law enforcement and public policy.\n\nThe MPs could plainly hear me. But there was no human contact. For all the impression I was making on their minds, I might as well have been speaking Martian. And their report said what all these reports say: \u2018Give Up!\u2019\n\nThere is hardly a voice to be heard, either in Parliament, or the BBC, or in most major newspapers, against this literally mad policy of permitting the free use of terrible mind-destroying, family-destroying poisons.\n\nYet in the real world of our cities, where the stink of dope is seldom absent and the crazy violence grows and grows, millions know from grim experience that they are wrong.\n\nHow can these MPs claim to be our representatives? And what is it that makes them so receptive to the wicked, dangerous and greedy drug legalisation lobby. I\u2019d like to see a report on that.\n\nA story they don't want you to read\n\nHere\u2019s a curious story, that for some reason the BBC and the major international news agencies have not covered, though they definitely know about it.\n\nDid Britain, France and the USA have right on their side when we bombed Syria in April 2018 \u2013 supposedly in response to a poison gas attack by the Damascus regime? Or was the action rash and lawless?\n\nIn fact, we and the other countries did not actually wait for any investigation by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) \u2013 the recognised international watchdog.\n\nSo imagine how awkward it would have been if the OPCW (which receives much support from Paris, London and Washington) had reported that claims of a poison gas attack were untrue, or at least unproven. Our bombing would then have been illegal.\n\nDid Britain, France and the USA have right on their side when we bombed Syria in April 2018 \u2013 supposedly in response to a poison gas attack by the Damascus regime? Or was the action rash and lawless? The impact of a regime airstrike is pictured above\n\nAnd imagine the relief in those capitals when the OPCW duly reported that it was reasonable to conclude that chlorine gas had been used. It was a pretty weak conclusion (and the original, more serious claim, that sarin had been used, was dismissed).\n\nAnd imagine the rage and upset in those same capitals when a whistleblower at the OPCW leaked information suggesting that this conclusion may have been wrong, and that gas cylinders supposedly dropped by helicopter could in fact have been placed at the scene by hand.\n\nSince the only people in the conflict who have helicopters are the Syrian state, this detail is pretty crucial.\n\nHe said this rather important information had been mysteriously left out of the official report.\n\nLast week, a former boss of the OPCW, Jose Bustani, backed the whistleblower, and publicly accused the organisation of \u2018irregular behaviour\u2019 during its investigation.\n\nMr Bustani said he had long held doubts about the alleged attack in Douma, on the outskirts of Damascus, saying: \u2018I could make no sense of what I was reading in the international press. Even official reports of investigations seemed incoherent at best.\u2019\n\nWe have had quite enough wars on false pretences. It costs lives, including those of our soldiers. This stuff is important.\n\nWorld On Fire makes facts go up in smoke\n\nI am gripped, but entirely in the wrong way, by the BBC drama World On Fire. It is ludicrously bad (with the exception of the waspish, clever performance of Lesley Manville as a rich and therefore bad person).\n\nEvery single politically correct button is pressed. People turn up in places where they could not possibly be.\n\nHistory and geography are violated. Absolutely no knowledge at all is shown of the events involved. And every cliche is milked to the limit.\n\nTonight we reach Dunkirk. I am agog to see how they will manage to misunderstand that.\n\nEvery single politically correct button is pressed. People turn up in places where they could not possibly be. History and geography are violated\n\nIf you want to comment on Peter Hitchens click here", "description": "PETER HITCHENS: I have read the document they grandly call a report.
