Then, Fiji was on the receiving end of one of the World Cup\u2019s big upsets when it lost 30-27 to Uruguay, which went on to be soundly beaten 33-7 by Georgia.\n\nIt means that victory for Georgia against Fiji in Osaka on Thursday will all-but guarantee third place - likely behind Wales or two-time champion Australia - and a slot at the 2023 World Cup. It would be a perfect way for head coach Milton Haig to bid farewell after eight years in charge.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be fair in saying that if Georgia wins this game, we\u2019ll qualify for the next World Cup,\u201d Haig said. \u201cLogistically, nobody else could catch us unless there are some huge, huge upsets. So we are confident that if we get this job done, we\u2019ll have qualified. This is what we\u2019ve worked hard for over the past three years. It\u2019s come down to this and we always knew it would.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s fully braced for a Fiji backlash, however, and expects to see the team which fared so well early on against Australia rather than the side which lost to Uruguay.\n\n\u201cThe whole world knows about the Fijian team,\u201d Haig said. \u201cThey\u2019ll look to run the ball, I\u2019m absolutely certain of that.\u201d\n\nFiji\u2019s had an eight-day turnaround since losing to Uruguay, in what is a must-win game before it faces group leader Wales - the Six Nations Grand Slam champion.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s national-record tally of five tries against Uruguay carried on the momentum generated from the second half of its 43-14 loss to Wales. The Georgians trailed that one 29-0, but matched the Welsh 2-2 in converted tries after the break and often dominated in the scrum.\n\nFiji\u2019s pack has its work cut out, considering five of Georgia\u2019s seven tries so far have been scored by forwards. So Fiji has to handle Georgia\u2019s imposing pack before getting its own flying backs into the game.\n\n\u201cThey are a very strong set-piece team and it\u2019s about getting our set piece right to provide some good ball for our deadly backline,\u201d Fiji prop Campese Ma\u2019afu said. \u201cAnyone who knows the Flying Fijians well, we get our name from flying around the pitch a lot. But this week the main focus is to execute our plays and really apply some pressure at the set piece.\u201d\n\nFiji head coach John McKee has made 11 changes from the Uruguay game, choosing a considerably stronger lineup containing 13 of the 15 players who started against Australia.\n\nPeceli Yato, who missed the Uruguay match after showing signs of concussion following a high and heavy tackle in the Australia game, returns at No. 8 in a significant boost for McKee\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cPeceli has been a massive loss for us. He was in outstanding form against the Wallabies, and at the time he got injured was probably one of the best players on the park,\u201d McKee said. \u201cIt has been good to have had an eight-day turnaround to give us time to regroup and have a full week\u2019s training going into this game.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nGeorgia: Soso Matiashvili, Giorgi Kveseladze, David Kacharava, Merab Sharikadze (captain), Alexander Todua, Lasha Khmaladze, Vasil Lobzhanidze; Beka Gorgadze, Mamuka Gorgodze, Giorgi Tkhilaishvili, Konstantine Mikautadze, Giorgi Nemsadze, Beka Gigashvili, Shalva Mamukashvili, Mikheil Nariashvili.
