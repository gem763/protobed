Nevertheless, he may have a distinctive role to play in the coming months. After his hometown of El Paso, Texas, was hit by a deadly mass shooting in a Walmart, the former congressman has pivoted his 2020 campaign to focus primarily on guns. His impassioned arguments for gun control, born from his lived experience of leaving the campaign trail to sit with the victims of gun violence and their families, may set the Democratic conversation around guns, not least because O\u2019Rourke\u2019s competitors seem eager to hand him the mic and listen.", "description": "", "authors": ["Emma Green", "Theatlantic.Com Politics Archive"], "top_image": ""}
