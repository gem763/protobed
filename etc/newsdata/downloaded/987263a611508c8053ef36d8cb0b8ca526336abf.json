Ralph, a sequential arts professor at Savannah College of Art and Design, told Business Insider he has ideas for a follow-up to the book.\n\nBut he doesn't want to think about how it could relate to the Netflix series.\n\n\"I've been working on another book in that world, but I don't want to be concerned with how people think it might relate [to the show],\" he said. \"I just want to make the comic for the sake of making it, like that initial pure interest in making the first book.\"\n\nRalph started drawing the comic book \"for fun\" and posting pages to his personal blog before it gained a fanbase and was published as a graphic novel in 2011. He said he was inspired by his students' conversations about video games.\n\n\"I don't play any video games, but my students always talk about video games,\" he said. \"I was jealous of the adventures they were describing and I wondered if I could make a comic that's as engaging and is a journey that you go on with a character.\"\n\n\"Rampage\" director Brad Peyton pitched an adaptation of the graphic novel to Ralph in 2012 as \"Ferris Bueller in the apocalypse.\" Years went by before Netflix picked it up for a 10-episode season.\n\nIf Ralph were to create a sequel book, he'd want to do it on his own terms \u2014 and not think about Hollywood while making it.\n\n\"It just came from an interest in making it,\" he said. \"And maybe that's why Brad wanted to make it, because it was heartfelt. That's what I like to think.\"", "description": "Brian Ralph, the creator of the \"Daybreak\" graphic novel, doesn't want to be consumed with how a sequel could relate to Netflix's new series.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db0bb2ddee0190a33657c12?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
