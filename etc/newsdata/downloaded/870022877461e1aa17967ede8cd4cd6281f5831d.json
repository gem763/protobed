I don\u2019t know what success looks like at the moment.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s competitive at the top of the league and I don\u2019t think the league has given itself any real form yet other than Liverpool who are deservedly right up there and City, but the rest of us are trying to bridge that gap.\n\n\u2018If we can keep improving, I do believe we can start to bridge that gap.\n\n\u2018Hopefully this season and then we can look beyond that and see where we can go. We know we are young and hopefully that means we are going to get better.\u2019\n\nMORE: Man Utd should have sold Anthony Martial instead of Romelu Lukaku - Jenas", "description": "Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has named Manchester City star David Silva as his favourite Premier League player.
