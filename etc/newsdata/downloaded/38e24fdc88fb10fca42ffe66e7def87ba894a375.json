Donovan stayed clear of controversial remarks in his opening note on Wednesday, which covered topics from trade taxes to Brexit and global bond yields.\n\nA frequent commentator in financial media, Donovan set off a furor during a discussion of Chinese consumer prices, which had risen because a pig virus drove up pork costs. The situation mattered, he said, \u201cif you are a Chinese pig. It matters if you like eating pork in China.\u201d Social media commentators quickly condemned the first remark, interpreting it as a derogatory reference to local people rather than to ill swine.\n\nEven as many English speakers viewed the phrasing as innocuous, it set off a firestorm on Chinese social media. The comment was condemned by two Communist Party publications and by trade groups representing Chinese brokerages.", "description": "UBS Chief Economist Donovan Returns to Work After Swinegate Saga", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picbfbea105da937c8bd536d26cd47fc0b2.jpg"}
