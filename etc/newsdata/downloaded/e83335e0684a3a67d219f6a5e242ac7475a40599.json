We conceded possession of the ball too cheaply.\n\n\u201cParticularly in the first half we didn\u2019t create enough chances. Second half we had some good chances that we didn\u2019t take and throughout the night we were too open out of possession.\n\n\u201cSome of that was because of giving the ball away. So we gave the Czechs, who played well, got to give them credit, we gave them too many opportunities to score.\u201d\n\nFew could have foreseen this outcome given the way England carved the Czechs open to win March\u2019s Group A opener 5-0.\n\nBut, much like last month\u2019s 5-3 win against Kosovo, Southgate\u2019s side looked shaky at the back \u2013 and this time they lacked the attacking spark to get them through.\n\n\u201cI think whatever the balance, we didn\u2019t use the ball well enough,\u201d the England boss said.\n\n\u201cAnd in terms of a wake-up call, I think we\u2019ve had a lot of plaudits. I think we\u2019ve always maintained that there\u2019s a lot of work to be done to be a really top team.\n\n\u201cI think tonight was clear evidence of that. We have to respond in the right way.\n\n\u201cWe have a couple of days to regroup, not long, and we have to reward our supporters with a better performance than we gave tonight.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a night for positives, that\u2019s for sure. I think it\u2019s a night to accept the defeat, congratulate the Czechs and accept that we have to be better than we were.\u201d\n\nCzech counterpart Jaroslav Silhavy spoke in the pre-match press conference about targeting England\u2019s imperfections, yet could hardly believe how much joy they experienced on Friday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously over the moon but I have to thank my players, first and foremost, because they played great,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was a 100 per cent performance and that is the only way to succeed really, so we are very happy and I think time will show that we made history tonight because we defeated England after so many years and at a time when they are playing really well.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Gareth Southgate believes England\u2019s first qualification defeat in a decade shows how far they are from becoming \u201ca really top team\u201d.
