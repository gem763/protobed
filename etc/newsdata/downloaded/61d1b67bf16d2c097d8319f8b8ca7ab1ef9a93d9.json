Kelly says investing in her home renovation raised the value of her property from $500,000 to upwards of $650,000.\n\nThey converted a portion of their home into a 900-square-foot studio apartment last year, adding in a small kitchen and bathroom. Renters get access to the rest of her home, complete with 1940\u2019s wicker furniture and the laid back luxury of an indoor hammock for $2,800 a month.\n\n\u201cAs long as you pay, you can stay,\u201d says Kelly of her newfound entrepreneurial effort.\n\nShe enlisted the help of a local rental agent to advertise, handle home showings and run credit checks on perspective renters.\n\n\u201cWe used a local rental agent who handled everything \u2013 we didn\u2019t pay a penny. For us, it made a big difference because we don\u2019t know how to check credit.\u201d\n\nThe majority of people in the U.S. over the age of 60 want to \u201cage in place\u201d by staying in their current home or neighborhood, according to a report by AARP, however, they may face financial challenges in retirement that can make it difficult to do so.\n\nRenting seems to be solving that problem. Online vacation home rental site Airbnb said in a survey last year that more than 400,000 people over the age of 60 were renting out their homes worldwide using the site.\n\nAnd since the number of people over the age of 75 who are living alone is slated to almost double from 6.9 million to 13.4 million by 2035, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, having a little company can combat feelings of loneliness and isolation in addition to helping seniors make extra money.\n\nSome apps are marketing to seniors who may be looking to start a side hustle mainly for social interaction. The app Nesterly pairs seniors with empty rooms in their homes with students and young people who may be saddled with student loans or high housing costs with affordable places to live. It aims to combat loneliness for empty nesters while giving young people access to affordable living spaces.\n\n\u201cSometimes seniors engage in side hustles primarily for the experience, socialization and structured activities that you tend to lose when leaving the workplace,\u201d Kathy Kristof, editor-in-chief of SideHusl.com, an online platform that helps people find work, said.", "description": "Seniors are cashing in on home rentals to fund big trips post retirement.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2017/12/0/0/seniors-making-turkey_gettyimages-5-160498398244a510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
