A seasonal shuttle bus system, in place since 2000, has helped alleviate congestion along the park\u2019s scenic byways and at its entrance stations, but even stricter measures are under consideration, such as caps on visitor numbers and a reservations system to enter the park.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPark rangers suggest timing a trip during the shoulder months of October, November, March and April, or rising early to beat the crowds that flock to popular hiking trails such as Angels Landing and the Narrows. Bryce Canyon National Park, about 80 miles northeast of Zion, is a smaller and less crowded alternative, although its visitor numbers also have increased markedly in recent years. Home to the world\u2019s largest concentration of the weathered rock formations known as hoodoos, Bryce received nearly 2.7 million visits last year.\n\nLocation: Zion National Park is near Springdale, Utah, about 300 miles southwest of Salt Lake City.\n\nUnder-the-radar Capitol Reef is spectacular but not congested\n\nCapitol Reef National Park gets less attention than Utah\u2019s other national parks, in part because of its remote south-central locale and its relatively new stature as a park (Congress reclassified it from monument to national park in 1971). Like Zion, Capitol Reef offers spectacular ribbon-colored rock formations, jagged monoliths and gorge hikes that should be on any adventure traveler\u2019s bucket list. Unlike Zion, however, it also provides plenty of solitude, especially for those willing to navigate its unpaved roads and twisting canyons. Capitol Reef logged 1.2 million visits in 2018 \u2014 nearly a quarter of Zion\u2019s visitation numbers \u2014 and at 245,000 acres, it\u2019s nearly 60 percent bigger than Zion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe park gets its unusual name from the Waterpocket Fold, a 100-mile-long ridge in the earth\u2019s crust where sheer cliffs and white sandstone domes (which reminded early settlers of the U.S. Capitol building) formed a \u201creef,\u201d or barrier to travel.\n\nCapitol Reef was also once home to Native American tribes, who left their mark in petroglyphs, and Mormon pioneers, who established orchards that continue to produce fruits such as apples, peaches, pears and apricots today. Between June and October, visitors may stroll through and sample the fruit or fill a bag for a fee. (Hand-pickers and ladders are provided; a fruit-picking hotline provides up-to-date information on harvests: 435-425-3791.)\n\nAnother reason to add Capitol Reef to any Utah itinerary: its proximity to Scenic Byway 12, one of the most photogenic and geographically diverse roads in the world. Pick it up near Bryce Canyon and follow it north as it winds across a stunning swath of red-rock desert, green valleys, alpine forests and endless multihued plateaus. The road ends in Torrey, a pleasant town of motels and cafes known as the gateway to Capitol Reef, where more magnificent scenery awaits.\n\nLocation: Capitol Reef is near Torrey, Utah, about 220 miles south of Salt Lake City.\n\nRandall is a writer based in Los Angeles.\n\nMore from Travel:\n\nAD", "description": "The remote destination offers similarly spectacular vistas and hikes, and a location near Scenic Byway 12.", "authors": ["Laura Randall"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rO2kmcQdiN0SDwN6BresQyomauA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G42UWEHJCMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
