The body was found after the dumpster was taken to a landfill area.\n\nThis undated file photo released by the FBI shows 3-year-old Kamille \"Cupcake\": McKinney, who was abducted while attending a birthday party on Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019, in Birmingham, Ala. Her body was found 10 days later in a dumpster. Two people have been charged with murder in the case. More\n\nArrest warrants state that Kamille died of asphyxiation by suffocation on Oct. 12, the same day she went missing, AL.com reported.\n\nChildren at the birthday party where Kamille was abducted around 8:30 p.m. said she was grabbed by a man who took off in an SUV.\n\nThe abduction sparked an uproar in the community and an overwhelming response to a local crime stoppers program with both tips and reward money.\n\n\"This 3-year-old has Herculean power,\" said Birmingham police chief Patrick Smith. \"She has unified our city. She has brought people together ... She has touched a cord within the city. It was kind of a 'how-dare-you' crime \u2014 how dare you touch our children.\"\n\nSmith said there was no known connection between the suspects and Kamille or her family.\n\n\"They saw an opportunity to take a young child, and they did,\" Smith said.\n\nStallworth's family issued a statement after his arrest saying they were \"deeply saddened\" by Kamille's death.\n\n\"We offer our heartfelt prayers and sympathy to her family, but we know this is not enough,\" the family said. \"This precious child should have had a chance to enjoy life and pursue her dreams.\"\n\n\"We can\u2019t find enough words to express our grief, and we are distraught by the fact that a member of the Stallworth family is charged with this heinous act,\" they added. \"Patrick Stallworth\u2019s fate will be determined by a system of laws \u2013 a system that we revere and respect.\"\n\nThe statement said he was \"reared in a family with strong values.\"\n\n\"The actions he is alleged to have done in no way reflect who we are as a family,\" the statement said. \"We ask that our family not be judged by the actions of one individual. We abhor senseless violence, and even more so, we condemn acts of violence against defenseless children.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Kamille McKinney death: Child found in dumpster died of asphyxiation", "description": "An Alabama couple have been charged with capital murder in the suffocation death of 3-year-old Kamille \"Cupcake\" McKinney who was found in a dumpster", "authors": ["Doug Stanglin", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vMv7BAN_cpHQDl0VF4tDWQ--~B/aD0yMDAyO3c9MjYxNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/6028b6d6281cca4cca9c2e336af1aac1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
