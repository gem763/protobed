In his candid memoir of traveling with Ford, the former Newsweek correspondent Thomas DeFrank vividly described the cramped small jets and propeller planes that typically served as \u201cAir Force Two\u201d\u2014a phrase that began as a joke.\n\nRead more: The fragility of the Trump\u2013Pence relationship\n\nFord\u2019s travels might have been controversial. In this moment of national crisis, a new vice president acting as such an eager partisan for a damaged party? But criticism was held back by the knowledge, shared by Democrats and Republicans alike, that America was going to need Ford. The country was going to need him to be clean, and the surest way to protect him was to keep him far from Washington. Ford\u2019s intact reputation enabled Congress and the country to turn the page definitively in August 1974. Nixon\u2019s most tainted appointees had been forced from office before him. When Nixon resigned at last, the government could reset and begin a new era.\n\nDonald Trump may not know much of this history, but he intuits its lessons. From the beginning, he has appeared determined to implicate as many members of his administration as possible in his scandal\u2014Vice President Mike Pence heading the list.\n\nAt a press conference at the United Nations on September 25, Trump delivered a warning message. \u201cThe word is, they\u2019re going to ask for the first phone conversation. You can have it any time you need it. And also Mike Pence\u2019s conversations, which were, I think, one or two of them. They were perfect. They were all perfect.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Pence seems to have been involved up to the eyeballs in the Ukraine plot. His team\u2019s messaging\u2014Yes, he pressed the Ukrainians to investigate corruption, but he never appreciated that Trump\u2019s true purpose was to pursue the Bidens\u2014fails the laugh test. Pence\u2019s taint presents a political problem for him, but raises a much graver question for the country. If the Senate ever could muster the integrity to remove Trump from office, there would be no Ford to put in his place, only a vice president who participated in Trump\u2019s dirty schemes, from staying at a remote resort to direct government funds to Trump\u2019s failing Irish golf course to extorting an invaded country to fabricate political dirt to help Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nTrump\u2019s compromised attorney general remains on the job, as does his apparently compromised secretary of state. As the text messages from Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, confirm, the corruption permeates Trump\u2019s second- and third-level appointments, too.\n\nNot only is this scandal worse than Watergate\u2014the break-in at the Democratic National Committee offices did not betray the national-security interests of the United States\u2014but the outlook for the country is worse, too. There is no easy exit from the scandal by removing the president. Nixon\u2019s party broke with him after the release of the \u201csmoking gun\u201d tape in August 1974 removed any possibility of honest belief in Nixon\u2019s innocence. Trump\u2019s guilt has now passed that point\u2014and Trump\u2019s party protects him anyway.", "description": "The vice president is supposed to be prepared to step into the nation\u2019s highest office if necessary.", "authors": ["David Frum", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19244506641271/facebook.jpg?1570202353", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
