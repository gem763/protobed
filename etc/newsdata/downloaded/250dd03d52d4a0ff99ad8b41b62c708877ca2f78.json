Nike (NKE) was one of the names that came up Friday night. \"I think this stock goes higher. That was a great quarter,\" said Cramer.\n\nLet's check out the charts and indicators.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of NKE, bellow, we can see that prices consolidated from February to late September before recently breaking out to the upside. Prices are above the rising 50-day simple moving average line and above the rising 200-day moving average line.\n\nThe movement of the daily On-Balance-Volume matches the price strength and confirms the move to the upside. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is pointed up from above the zero line to add to the bullish story.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of NKE, below, we can see that prices made a new high for the move up and NKE is above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is close to a new high for the move up and this will be a good confirming indicator.\n\nThe weekly MACD oscillator just crossed to the upside from above the zero line for a fresh outright go long signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of NKE, below, we can see a potential upside price target of $107.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Maintain NKE longs and add to longs on strength. Risk a close below $89 now and look for strength to the $107 area.", "description": "Nike's Run Could Continue to New Highs...NKE", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Nike'S Run Could Continue To New Highs", "A Look At Nike'S Latest Charts", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "Bob Lang", "Timothy Collins", "Paul Price", "Doug Kass", "Jim"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/e384b2ea-d3d5-11e9-822b-27fa8f0fc82c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
