It's in Croydon. Probably best viewed at night,\" he adds \"This showroom is for display purposes only.\"\n\nThe post includes a flyer that reveals more about the project, hinting at an imminent online sale of the items on display. The website grossdomesticproduct.com currently shows an \"opening soon\" message.\n\n\"This shop has come about as a result of legal action. A greeting cards company are trying to seize legal custody of the name Banksy from the artist, who has been advised the best way to prevent this is to sell his own range of branded merchandise.\"\n\nRelated video: Banksy's shredded artwork renamed\n\nFrom Instagram: banksy\n\nThe flyer also states that prices start from \u00a310 (about $12) and availability will be limited.\n\nAmong the items on display are several prints, a baby's crib with CCTV cameras pointed at it, and a rug in the shape of an apparently defunct Tony the Tiger, the cereal mascot.\n\nThe stab-proof vest, bearing a large British flag, is a reference the the ongoing knife crime crisis in London. Stormzy was born in Croydon.\n\nFrom Instagram: banksy", "description": "A new Banksy installation has appeared in Croydon, South London, featuring the stab-proof vest worn by British star Stormzy during his headline set at the Glastonbury festival in July.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191001153813-banksy-croydon-01-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
