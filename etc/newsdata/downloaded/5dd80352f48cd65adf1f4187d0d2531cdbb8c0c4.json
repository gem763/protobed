The brothers are veteran dealmakers who have raised billions of dollars at RRJ and invested in a number of companies globally.\n\nRRJ\u2019s latest move comes as Malaysia\u2019s government, which inherited a debt-laden economy last year, is encouraging the private sector to play a bigger role in the economy. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, however, has struggled to win consensus for related policies.\n\nPLUS Malaysia is 51% owned by engineering infrastructure and services firm UEM Group Bhd, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Khazanah. State pension fund EPF owns the remainder.\n\nEPF did not respond to a request for comment. Khazanah said it was up to the government to decide on any such proposal.\n\n\u201cThere have been several proposals on toll highways. Khazanah itself has submitted its own proposal to the government. Ultimately, it is up to the government to consider these proposals and decide what is best for the country and the people,\u201d a Khazanah spokesman told Reuters.\n\nRRJ said the proposal to buy the firm in its entirety includes the interest of UEM Group and EPF in the redeemable convertible unsecured loan stock issued by Project Lebuhraya Usahasama, a wholly owned unit of PLUS Malaysia.\n\n\u201cRRJ is very focused on making long term private equity investments in Southeast Asia. Our focus will be large companies and major infrastructure investments such as airports, container ports, water treatment plants and toll roads,\u201d it said in an emailed response to a Reuters query.\n\nRRJ said it was open to partnering with Malaysian pension funds and working closely with the government on projects. It declined comment on specific projects.\n\nThe proposed acquisition is subject to conditions including an extension of the toll concessions period for an additional 20 years by the government.\n\nEdge Malaysia reported news over the weekend of RRJ\u2019s proposal to acquire PLUS Malaysia.", "description": "A consortium led by Asian private equity group RRJ Capital has proposed buying PLUS Malaysia Bhd, the country's biggest expressway toll firm, for 3 billion ringgit ($716 million), a document seen by Reuters showed.", "authors": ["Anshuman Daga", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
