The bank has not officially launched yet.\n\nMotsepe, ARC's chairperson, said in a statement that the transaction, once completed, would culminate in the first \"black-owned and controlled commercial, retail and digital bank in South Africa\".\n\n\"Growth and transformation of the economy remains an important objective, and something that all South Africans should be supporting. Economic growth will come about as a result of ongoing investment, including the type of investment we are announcing today.\"\n\nMotsepe said economic inclusivity would increase if the SA public were presented with a \"greater choice of bank products and when products are made available at significantly lower bank costs relative to peers\".\n\nIn September 2017, SA fintech outfit Tyme announced it had been granted a licence by the SA Reserve Bank. The operating licence to TymeDigital by Commonwealth Bank SA was the first issued to a new bank by SARB since 1999. At the time ARC acquired 10% of the bank's shares.\n\nARC said on Wednesday that TymeDigital was still trialling its operations as it works towards an official launch. \"[The bank] aims to provide affordable and accessible banking services through a growing network of partners, including Pick n Pay as its leading distribution partner, with 750 Pick 'n Pay and Boxer stores,\" ARC said in a statement.\n\nTymeDigital CEO Sandile Shabalala said in a statement that the digital bank was \"delighted [that] our business will have a much stronger association with ARC, which is becoming a formidable force in the financial services industry\".\n\n* Sign up to Fin24's top news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO FIN24 NEWSLETTER", "description": "Motsepe said completion of the transaction would culminate in the first \"black-owned and controlled commercial, retail and digital bank in South Africa\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5243/8081e11e8c694fb7b8c95cb0647dafab.jpg", "published_at": "2018-08-08"}
