Nearly 3,000 people died in the Sept. 11 terror attacks and thousands more suffered injuries.\n\nAbraham described One World Trade as \"gorgeous, beautiful and in memory of a lot of loved ones and a lot of others lost,\" and added she believes it's important for her 9-year-old daughter to learn about Sept. 11, as she wasn't alive when it happened.\n\nCELEBRITY 9/11 TRIBUTES: ALYSSA MILANO, MARK WAHLBERG, KALEY CUOCO AND MORE STARS MARK 18TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nWhile Abraham seemingly didn't notice her mistake in her video, which she uploaded to Instagram and YouTube, social media users were quick to condemn her, claiming the error was disrespectful.\n\nOne commenter said while they don't normally judge others, they felt Abraham's video \"is so disrespecting towards the people who lost and probably still are in pain of what happened that day... Many have fought to help a lot of people and many have lost their lives that day.\"\n\nFARRAH ABRAHAM SUFFERS MAJOR WARDROBE MALFUNCTION AT VENICE FILM FESTIVAL\n\n\"Just another vlog for you to get likes.
