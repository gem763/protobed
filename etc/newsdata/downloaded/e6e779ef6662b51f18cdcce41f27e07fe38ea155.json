Historically, our polls have shown a modest increase in support for the idea of a national health plan (Figure 1) once we included the phrase \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d which has only recently slightly decreased to about half (51%) holding favorable views. There has also been relatively stable support for the federal government doing more to help provide health insurance for more Americans since before the passing of the 2010 Affordable Care (Figure 2). Recently, we have found broad support for proposals that expand the role of public programs like Medicare and Medicaid as well as a government-administered public option (Figure 3). Overall, a majority of Democrats and about half of independents favor a national Medicare-for-all plan while most Republicans oppose (Figure 4). Yet, how politicians discuss these different proposals does affect public support (Figure 5 and Figure 6). In addition, when asked why they support or oppose a national health plan, the public echoes the dominant messages in the current political climate (Figure 7). A common theme among supporters, regardless of how we ask the question, is the desire for universal coverage (Figure 8).\n\nThere is robust support among Democrats, and even support among Republicans, for an expansion of the Medicare program through a Medicare buy-in or a Medicaid buy-in proposal (Figure 9). Yet, it is unclear how much staying power this support has once people become aware of the details of any plan or hear arguments on either side. Current KFF polling finds that Americans know little about how the leading Medicare-for-all proposals would reshape the way all Americans get and pay for health care (Figure 10) and public support for Medicare-for-all shifts significantly when people hear arguments about potential tax increases or delays in medical tests and treatment (Figure 11). KFF polling also shows many people falsely assume they would be able to keep their current health insurance under a single-payer plan (Figure 12), suggesting another potential area for decreased support especially since most supporters (67 percent) of such a proposal think they would be able to keep their current health insurance coverage (Figure 13).\n\nMedicare-for-all, an issue which really gained traction during Bernie Sanders\u2019 run during the 2016 presidential primary, does seem to be on the minds of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents at the beginning of the 2020 primary season. But KFF polling finds more Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents would prefer voting for a candidate who wants to build on the ACA in order to expand coverage and reduce costs rather than replace the ACA with a national Medicare-for-all plan (Figure 14). So while the general idea of a national health plan (whether accomplished through an expansion of Medicare or some other way) may enjoy fairly broad support in the abstract, it remains unclear how this issue will play out in the 2020 election and beyond.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.kff.org/wp-content/themes/kaiser-foundation-2016/static/images/kaiser-grey-logo-4x3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
