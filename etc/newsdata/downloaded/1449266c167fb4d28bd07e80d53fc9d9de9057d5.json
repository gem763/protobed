I'm letting you go.\" \"Letting me go where?\" \"You've done terrific for me, but I'm going to bring in some of the young kids.\"\n\n'This is when the Class of '92 were around. I was older then, a little bit gobby.\n\nPhelan is back at Old Trafford working as assistant manager to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\n\n'\"Who?\" \"I'm going to play Gary Neville.\" \"Gary Neville? What's he got? Come on, Gaffer. You're gonna play a kid?\" \"Yeah\".'\n\nPhelan would go on to join West Brom, where he would spend 18 months before deciding to hang up his boots.\n\nPhelan would end up serving as Ferguson's assistant between 2008-2013 and he returned to Old Trafford last year to work alongside Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.", "description": "The versatile right-back signed for the Old Trafford outfit from fellow English side Norwich back in 1989 but his career with the club came to a frustrating end five years later.", "authors": ["Jonathan Spencer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/17/20091808-0-image-a-2_1571846520374.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
