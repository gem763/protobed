Friday, rejecting its $36.6 billion bid and questioning Hong Kong\u2019s future as a financial gateway to China.\n\nUndeterred, the HKEX said it was disappointed the LSE had failed to properly engage in talks and said it would continue to talk to LSE shareholders about its unsolicited offer.\n\nThe U.K. operator said it remains committed to buying financial-information and terminal company Refinitiv Holdings Ltd., a $14.5 billion deal it struck in July that would have been scrapped if the Hong Kong exchange succeeded in its bid.\n\nShares in LSE were 2% higher after the rejection, having already risen almost 6% on Wednesday after HKEX announced its unsolicited offer, surprising investors. Analysts say HKEX could improve its offer with a larger cash component, or that other exchanges may want to bid for the London exchange.\n\nHKEX\u2019s bid has led some investors and analysts to question whether a new round of global exchange consolidation is coming, potentially involving the U.S. exchange giants: NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc., known as ICE, or futures-exchange behemoth CME Group Inc., the world\u2019s biggest exchange operator by market cap.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d expect the U.S. exchanges might be viewed as logical additions to fill the North American presence of a truly global exchange model,\u201d Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners wrote in a research note Thursday. ICE explored a possible bid for the LSE in 2016 but ultimately backed away.\n\nRepresentatives of CME and ICE declined to comment.\n\nIn a letter to the Hong Kong exchange issued publicly, LSE Chairman Don Robert said LSE\u2019s board doesn\u2019t believe HKEX is the best partner for its long-term positioning in Asia, and that the company\u2019s cash-and-shares offer is unattractive because of \u201cinherent uncertainty\u201d around the value of HKEX shares.\n\n\u201cWe question the sustainability of HKEX\u2019s position as a strategic gateway in the longer term,\u201d Mr. Robert said. He added that the Shanghai Stock Exchange is its preferred and direct channel to access opportunities in China.\n\nA successful tie-up between LSE and HKEX looked like a long shot to many analysts because of regulatory and political hoops. Hong Kong is reeling from a summer of antigovernment protests that have raised concerns about China\u2019s tightening grip on the financial center. London is grappling with its own political upheaval in the form of Brexit.\n\nThe history of the exchange business over the past decade is riddled with failed cross-border deals. Many of these were blocked by regulators out of concerns that a prized national asset would be taken over by foreigners, or that the takeover would give the combined company monopolistic pricing power in crucial financial markets. Exchanges themselves have often failed to agree on deal terms and how to structure a combined entity.\n\nThe bid from Hong Kong was the latest for LSE, which has become a highly sought-after target for a range of suitors over several years, attracting multiple bids and making multiple acquisitions of its own. The group, which has been offering stock trading for more than 200 years, now derives much of its value from data services and the popularity of passive investing.\n\nRevenue from LSE\u2019s clearing house and financial indexing business far outstrips a 20% contribution from its more traditional exchange businesses of floating companies and securities trading. That was the big lure for the Hong Kong exchange group.\n\nDeal or No Deal The London Stock Exchange has been a favorite target and an active acquiror in the deal market, though many attempts failed. London Stock Exchange OM Gruppen 2000 $1.58 billion Withdrawn merger $1.55 billion July 2001 LSE market debut \u201902 Deutsche Boerse $2.19 \u201904 Macquarie Bank $2.37 Nasdaq $4.01 \u201906 Nasdaq $4.56 Borsa Italiana $2.15 Dubai International Financial Centre $1.65 \u201908 Completed merger TMX Group $2.53 \u201910 Acquisition \u201912 Frank Russell $2.70 \u201914 Russell Investments $1.15 Deutsche Boerse $13.88 \u201916 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Refinitiv $27 \u201918 $36.6 Proposed offer Pending merger $31.19 billion LSE Sept. 11 market cap\n\nLSE\u2019s stock has soared ninefold in the past 10 years, compared with a 47% rise in the FTSE 100 index of the U.K.\u2019s largest companies. It had risen 80% this year even before the HKEX offer.\n\nThat performance sets it apart from other U.K. financial companies such as banks whose stocks have been dragged down by low interest rates and stricter regulation since the financial crisis. In contrast, LSE has benefited from postcrisis rules pushing more derivatives through its LCH clearing house and a boom in indexed funds.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Is Refinitiv the LSE\u2019s best option for growth or should it be open to other potential deals? Join the conversation below.\n\nTracing its roots to City of London coffee houses where stockbrokers set up shop, LSE thrived as London established itself as a global hub for company fundraising and trading. It floated its own shares in 2000, and spent much of the next decade fending off takeover attempts by rivals including Nasdaq and Deutsche Boerse AG .\n\nIt has averaged a bid approach every 2\u00bd years since its initial public offering, according to analysts at Berenberg Bank.\n\nBut while British banks during the 2000s were multiplying in value from global expansion and increased risk taking, the London exchange was at threat of becoming obsolete. Its monopoly on domestic stock trading was ended by a 2007 European Union directive that paved the way for alternative trading platforms. It suffered more and its shares slumped as company listings and trading volumes collapsed after the financial crisis.\n\nXavier Rolet, who was LSE\u2019s chief executive between 2009 and 2017, is credited with reversing the decline and transforming the company into a global force. He led the acquisition of around 25 companies, including LCH and the FTSE Russell financial indexing business.\n\nAs of June 30, LSE\u2019s post-trade services made up 38% of its \u00a31.14 billion ($1.41 billion) in revenue, and information services made up 39%.\n\nIn an interview Thursday, Mr. Rolet said his vision for LSE was to deepen its role connecting companies, banks and investors globally, and to let users pay for the products and pieces of financial plumbing they needed access to, rather than making them pay for bundled services at a single price.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be one of the two or three financial infrastructure companies with the full set of products,\u201d Mr. Rolet said. He predicted LSE will eventually have an American or Chinese owner as the industry continues to consolidate.\n\nHis successor, David Schwimmer, set three goals for the group: to expand globally, become more diversified by asset class and bolster its data analytics business. In August, Mr. Schwimmer said the plan to buy Refinitiv, which supplies market information and operates foreign-exchange and bond trading platforms, addresses all of those ambitions.\n\nLSE\u2019s earlier smart bets made the Refinitiv bid possible, since it has a strong share price to use as currency, said Chris Turner, a senior equity analyst at Berenberg. The planned purchase, agreed with Refinitiv\u2019s shareholder Blackstone Group, shot LSE stock up 30%.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem for Hong Kong exchange. Now you need to pay a premium over that premium. It\u2019s too expensive now for others,\u201d Mr. Turner said.\n\n\u2014Alexander Osipovich and Caitlin Ostroff contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Margot Patrick at margot.patrick@wsj.com", "description": "The U.K. exchange operator rejected a $36.6 billion bid from Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, saying it had \u201cfundamental concerns\u201d about the price and Hong Kong\u2019s long-term future as a financial gateway.", "authors": ["Margot Patrick", "Margot.Patrick Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106917/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
