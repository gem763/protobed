Originally conceived as a safe space for \u201c Republicans and all who identify with the GOP movement\u201d to establish their websites, .gop is one of hundreds of new top-level domains approved in 2014 by internet authorities as alternatives to old familiar suffixes like .com and .org.\n\n\u201c The .gop registry is a technology endeavor dedicated to positioning the Republican Party at the forefront of innovation and advancing Republican principles,\u201d the RSLC writes on its website, describing .gop as \u201cthe place where you can find conservative people and ideas on the web.\u201d\n\nSprinkled among those are some websites that don\u2019t exactly advance Republican principles, such as the satirical \u201cPutin/Trump 2020 campaign\u201d blog at Putin2020.gop and the long-running \u201casshat.gop,\u201d which consists of nothing but a photo of President Trump.\n\nIt turns out you don\u2019t have to be a Republican to register a .gop domain. Some top-level domains have rules and restrictions on who is allowed to use them\u2014to register a domain ending in .scot, for example, you must be a member of the Scottish community. But .gop isn\u2019t one of them. It\u2019s open to anyone willing to pay $20 a year for a domain.\n\nNow, with the GOP\u2019s no quid pro quo website giving the suffix new exposure, more Trump critics may be moving in.\n\nThe most recent addition in this vein is Putins.GOP, set up last Friday by 63-year-old network engineer and amateur domain prospector Michael Monsport. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Monsport said he\u2019s been grabbing domains for prospective resale since 1996, when he scored \u201castronaut.com.\u201d Lately he\u2019s been snarfing up domains critical of Trump, whom he dislikes, but it wasn\u2019t until he saw one of the GOPs anti-impeachment ads that he realized he could be erecting anti-Trump sites in the Republicans\u2019 own internet backyard.\n\n\u201c I register names out of anger, irony, and profit. I\u2019ve got all sorts of dot-coms, \u2018QueensGrifter,\u2019 \u2018TrumpsATraitor.\u2019 When Nancy Pelosi said, \u2018All roads lead to Putin,\u2019 nobody registered it. So i did\u2026 \u201d \u2014 Michael Monsport\n\n\u201cI register names out of anger, irony, and profit,\u201d Monsport said. \u201cI\u2019ve got all sorts of dot-coms, \u2018QueensGrifter,\u2019 \u2018TrumpsATraitor.\u2019 When Nancy Pelosi said, \u2018All roads lead to Putin,\u2019 nobody registered it. So i did\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t know .gop was available,\u201d Monsport added. \u201cThat they administer the domain yet they didn\u2019t buy up all the potentially problematic ones is really odd to me.\u201d\n\nDespite the initial fanfare in 2014, .gop domains peaked in popularity at about 3,000 registered addresses in September 2015, just before the first round of unrenewed domains dropped out of the system and sent the numbers plummeting. Today there are about 1,200 .gop domains, largely Republican politicians and regional party offices, according to statistics from nTLDstat. (The RSLC declined comment for this article.)\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign season, the .gop was so neglected that neither the Trump campaign nor the RNC registered DonaldTrump.gop. It was finally picked up by a former Clinton campaign staffer one month before Election Day.\n\n\u201cI was actually surprised it was available,\u201d said Matthew Ortega, a political web consultant. \u201cI just started searching a bunch of terms and after a while I collected a bunch of these.\u201d\n\nDespite drawing middling traffic, Ortega held on to DonaldTrump.gop, and today he redirects incoming visitors to another website he runs cataloging corruption allegations against the Trump administration.\n\nHe said he might have grabbed more of the GOP\u2019s online real estate if the $20 registration fee didn\u2019t go to the Republicans. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I haven\u2019t gone hog wild buying the domains,\u201d he said.", "description": "It turns out you don\u2019t have to be a Republican to register a .gop domain\u2014and trolls are taking full advantage, with Putins.GOP the latest addition to the roster.", "authors": ["Kevin Poulsen", "Sr. National Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572374835/191029-gop-sites-tease_a7owdb", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
