The casualties were so great that the water would turn red and thus became known as \u2018The River of Blood.\u2019 It is my great honor to have preserved this important section of the Potomac River! \u2060\u2014 Donald John Trump\u201d\n\nThree local historians, however, told the Times the story wasn\u2019t accurate.\n\n\u201cNo. Uh-uh. No way. Nothing like that ever happened there,\u201d said Richard Gillespie of the Mosby Heritage Area Association.\n\n\u201cHow would they know that? Were they there?\u201d then-candidate Trump responded.\n\nHashtags poking fun at the president\u2019s historical embellishments and inaccuracies have been popping all year, like #LostTrumpHistory and #RevolutionaryWarAirports.\n\nAD\n\nThis isn\u2019t even the first time Civil War rhetoric has launched a million joke tweets. In July 2018, #SecondCivilWarLetters satirized conspiracy theorists Alex Jones\u2019s baseless claim that Democrats planned to launch a second domestic rebellion on July 4.\n\nAD\n\nMy Darling,\n\nWar is hell. The Battle of Trader Joe's lasted many days. We lost half our battalion, some to enemy fire, some to the dreaded Covfefe virus. I still live, but for how much longer I do not know.\n\n\n\nPray for us.#secondcivilwarletters \u2014 Kelli Crackel (@KelliCrackel) July 3, 2018\n\nThis time, though, it was the commander in chief invoking the language of insurrection, so not everyone got the joke.\n\nHistorian and journalist David M. Perry tweeted Monday: \u201cI don\u2019t really mind if y\u2019all make #CivilWarSignUp jokes if it helps you cope. But remember some of us aren\u2019t laughing. I\u2019m not laughing.\u201d\n\nApproximately 620,000 soldiers died during the American Civil War, according to the American Battlefield Trust. That\u2019s a little fewer than the number killed in all other conflicts in U.S. history combined.\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nHow the Founding Fathers saw impeachment and \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors\u2019\n\n#LostTrumpHistory: Trump\u2019s 9/11 claims become a George Conway-pushed meme\n\nTrump\u2019s Fourth of July history speech: Turns out there weren\u2019t airports back then\n\nDoctors demanded male nurses during the Civil War.
