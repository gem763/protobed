Expected to be available to customers from mid-2020, the facility will be an essential addition to the Singapore telco's datacentre network with the emergence of 5G services.\n\nStarHub added that the new 60-megawatt hyperscale campus would be \"carrier-neutral\" and could interconnect to public cloud providers also located at the AirTrunk SGP1 site. Located in Loyang and close to the Changi North Cable Landing Station, the Singapore telco said in a statement Wednesday that the data centre served as a critical gateway to for several major submarine cables that linked Singapore with other global markets.\n\nAirTrunk in April said it was investing SGD$450 million in the new facility, which would push its data centre footprint in the region to three. The Australian company said the site would be the largest neutral data centre in Singapore and was specifically designed for hyperscale cloud, content, and enterprise customers.\n\nGoogle talks up APAC cloud support as Alibaba intensifies gameplay Amid Alibaba's increased efforts to build up its cloud footprint, Google also is beefing up its coverage in Asia-Pacific where it says it will operate seven cloud regions by early-2019, up from just one region two years ago.

The data centre also was expected to secure the Building and Construction Authority Green Mark Platinum certification and industry-low power usage effectiveness (PUE).\n\nA StarHub spokesperson told ZDNet the telco operates seven data centres, including facilities it owns as well as sites leased from partners.\n\nHyperscale data centres are expansive facilities comprising hundreds of thousands of servers and highly scalable. According to Synergy Research Group, the top five hyperscale spenders in 2018 were Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Apple. The sector clocked nearly $120 billion in capex last year, up 43% from the previous year.\n\nOutside of the pack of five hyperscale spenders, Synergy Research pointed to China's Alibaba, Tencent, JD.com, and Baidu as amongst the world's leading hyperscale spenders in 2018. The year also saw telcos as big spenders including China Mobile, NTT, Deutsche Telekom, AT&T, and Verizon.\n\nThe research firm said a bulk of the hyperscale capex went towards building, expanding, and equipping huge data centers, which had grown to 439 worldwide. Synergy Research's chief analyst John Dinsdale said: \"The hyperscale operators are quickly becoming the capex kings of the IT world. On average, hyperscale operator revenues are growing by 20% per year driven by expansion of cloud services, e-commerce, social media, and online advertising.\"\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nAirTrunk raises SG$450m for new Singapore data centre\n\nThe Australian company plans to boost its APAC presence by building a new 60+ megawatt hyperscale data centre in Singapore.\n\nSingapore commits resources to drive 5G, earmarks key verticals for adoption\n\nIndustry regulator Infocomm Media Development Authority has set aside S$40 million (US$29.53 million) to support research and development efforts and drive adoption of 5G, which include initiatives focused on key verticals such as urban mobility and maritime.\n\nHow hyperscale data centers are reshaping all of IT\n\nIn a world where technology and miniaturization are often considered BFFs, the most important innovations of the 21st century take place in facilities that may be seen from space.\n\nInfrastructure needs to be ready for cloud to take off in APAC\n\nMarkets such as Indonesia still are grappling to roll out fibre connectivity to all users, without which cloud adoption will be premature, while some large businesses also have to ensure it makes economic sense to do so.\n\nAPAC firms look to edge for faster response but worry over data security\n\nEdge computing is being sought out for faster response and cost savings, but there are concerns about security and latency when large volumes of data are processed on such platforms.", "description": "Available to StarHub customers from mid-2020, AirTrunk's 60-megawatt facility will be essential in meeting anticipated need for hyperscale data centre support with the emergence of 5G mobile edge computing capabilities, says the Singapore telco.", "authors": ["Eileen Yu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/03/10/63387c43-1d17-11e4-8c7f-00505685119a/thumbnail/770x578/2bae2168f96ab2634313066b6e9d039a/data-centre-thumb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
