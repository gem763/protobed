He was not aware of any electronic recordings made by the U.S. government on calls between Trump and other world leaders.\n\nEvelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense during the Obama presidency, said not only would any so-called transcript be based on notes, but it would also likely be incomplete because the note-takers usually do not include issues that could be controversial if they became public.", "description": "", "authors": ["Reuters.Com Article"], "top_image": ""}
