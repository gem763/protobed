Why don\u2019t you go to the library?\u2019\n\nMy cheeks were on fire. I would spend a lot of time in the library over the next seven years.\n\nI can\u2019t remember a time when I wasn\u2019t called a nerd, geek or a swot at school. It was part of my identity before I even knew what an \u2018identity\u2019 was. I was incorrigibly bookish with a perfect homework record and great marks, and well-behaved and enthusiastic in class.\n\nI was lucky enough to find many subjects easy and also had a respect for the authority of teachers that I can\u2019t quite explain as an adult. I had to do my homework, or else.\n\nBeing a nerd meant more than good behaviour and good marks (Picture: Amelia McGoldrick for Metro.co.uk)\n\nIn primary school, my label wasn\u2019t a bad thing. It was a small school where we knew what each other were like and just accepted it: This lot were the swots, those boys were naughty, so and so went for extra English help, and so on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in high school it became more hostile; names were shouted across the playground, whispers in the classroom, teasing when the teachers were out of earshot.\n\nI was never beaten up or bullied the way you see in US high school films, but it definitely fostered a profound sense of discomfort, like I didn\u2019t belong.\n\nBeing a nerd meant more than good behaviour and good marks. Other girls got straight As, but they weren\u2019t labelled like me. Nerdiness went hand in hand with my weirdness.\n\nNormal teenage behaviour like trying your first drink or kissing someone is instantly hilarious to others because it\u2019s you doing it (Picture: Amelia McGoldrick for Metro.co.uk)\n\nIt was the glasses, the horrendous dress sense, the chronic social awkwardness, the complete lack of interest in boys.\n\nA friend once sent me a joke Valentines card saying \u2018My heart is yours\u2026 but you\u2019ll never have my kidneys!\u2019 just so the popular kids would see me getting a red envelope in assembly.\n\nBeing labelled a nerd doesn\u2019t just shape your own identity, it determines how everyone else sees you, too.\n\nNormal teenage behaviour like trying your first drink or kissing someone is instantly hilarious to others because it\u2019s you doing it. You\u2019re constantly living up to the label through your academic success because it defines you.\n\nI don\u2019t think society sees geeks as bad. Despite the implications of eccentricity and awkwardness, we associate it with accomplishment, dedication, and an almost childlike fascination with our abstruse academic field of choice \u2013 especially if that\u2019s a highly lucrative field of computer programming.\n\nIt\u2019s been years since anybody has called me a swot or a nerd, but if they did, I would own it (Picture: Amelia McGoldrick for Metro.co.uk)\n\nHow many films and series are protagonised by geeks cast as the plucky underdog with a kooky obsession with science?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s been years since anybody has called me a swot or a nerd, but if they did, I would own it. I know that caring about your studies and trying your best is a good thing.\n\nPicking on someone for being a swot is about resentment, frustration, and responding to someone else\u2019s success by dragging them down.\n\nThat attitude is the product of a high school culture that defines you by academic ability, carefully grading the whole class and ranking you by this one narrow metric. It\u2019s important to recognise the role people\u2019s life circumstances play in their school performance, too.\n\nI\u2019m from a supportive middle-class family \u2013 would I have kept up my academic performance if I\u2019d had to work evenings so my family could make ends meet?\n\nIt was only when I started university at Cambridge that I felt my label dissolve around me; suddenly, everyone was a good student and I was average.\n\nHere, nobody looked at me twice for reading a book at lunch \u2013 mostly because they were too engrossed in books of their own.\n\nI\u2019m in the second year of my masters now, and I\u2019m considering applying for PhDs afterwards. My boyfriend of 10 years is a total nerd too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m still capable of raising eyebrows when I wax lyrical about my subject, but while it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019m still geeky and weird, I\u2019ve made my peace with the label.\n\nLabels Labels is an exclusive series that hears from individuals who have been labelled \u2013 whether that be by society, a job title, or a diagnosis. Throughout the project, writers will share how having these words ascribed to them shaped their identity \u2014 positively or negatively \u2014 and what the label means to them.
