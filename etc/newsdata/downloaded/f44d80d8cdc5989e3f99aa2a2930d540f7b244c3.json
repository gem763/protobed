Friday's employment report, which is projected to show moderate job and wage growth, will update policy makers on how households are positioned to sustain their spending.\n\nFour service industries reported decreased activity in September, including real estate, rental and leasing and wholesale trade.\n\nThe ISM's gauge of services employment decreased to 50.4, the lowest level since February 2014 and just above a reading of 50 that indicates firms are neither adding to nor reducing their payrolls.\n\nThe pullback in hiring doesn't bode well for the Labor Department's monthly employment report.

Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM non-manufacturing business survey committee, told reporters Thursday that \"there's a combination of things going on in employment\".\n\n\"It's just tough getting workers to fit certain open positions,\" he said. \"There has been some pullback as well by the respective companies.\"\n\nThe ISM's index of business activity among non-manufacturers, which parallels the group's measure of factory production, fell to 55.2 in September, erasing most of the prior month's gain. The measure of new orders dropped by the most since August 2016, reaching a three-year low of 53.7.\n\nThe group's measure of prices paid by non-manufacturing industries climbed to 60 in September. The import gauge sank into contraction at 49 while the export index improved to 52.\n\nAnother gauge of service industries from IHS Markit rose slightly to 50.9, showing near-stagnant activity, according to a separate report Thursday.\n\nBloomberg\n\nWashington Post", "description": "The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index dropped 3.8 points to 52.6 in September, the lowest since August 2016.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6391%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_170%2C$y_104/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d5b44ff9c5ccf52e764954a398e969d4fc560461", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
