He had been issued subpoenas along with former top White House aides Rob Porter and Rick Dearborn.\n\nPorter and Dearborn did not show up on Tuesday afternoon, with Porter\u2019s attorney citing direction from White House counsel Pat Cipollone for him to refuse to testify. Lewandowski agreed to appear, but only to discuss matters that were in the report on the Russia investigation made public last spring by former special counsel Robert Mueller. In particular, Democrats hoped to question Lewandowski about Trump instructing him to deliver a message to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia investigation, about Trump being treated \u201cvery unfairly\u201d\u2019 by Mueller. The exchange between Lewandowski and Mueller took place in the Oval Office, and is described in detail in the Mueller report.\n\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.

In his opening statement, ranking member Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., angrily denounced the hearing as a case of \u201clet\u2019s read the Mueller report for audiobook.\u201d In other words, in his view, House Democrats were simply reciting Mueller\u2019s report over and over, hoping that doing so would lead to Trump\u2019s impeachment. He added that the \u201cimpeachment charade\u201d was, in his view, \u201cimpulsive and poorly designed.\u201d\n\nBut many of the recitations of the Mueller report that followed came at Lewandowski\u2019s insistence. Questioned by the committee\u2019s chairman, Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., about the June 19, 2017, meeting between Lewandowski and Trump, Lewandowski said he needed \u201cthe exact language of the report\u201d to answer if the meeting had simply taken place.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I need to do that,\u201d Nadler retorted.\n\nLewandowski insisted. \u201cCongressman, I\u2019d like you to refresh my memory,\u201d he said, \u201cby providing a copy of the report so I can follow along.\u201d That led to a search for a printed copy of the report, which Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., produced. By then, however, Nadler\u2019s five-minute questioning time was up, and Collins forced the committee to take a vote on whether Nadler was allowed to exceed that limit.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler during a hearing with Corey Lewandowski, former campaign manager for President Trump, on Tuesday.

He later tweeted that Lewandowski had given a \u201cbeautiful\u201d opening statement.\n\nPerhaps the preeminent Trump loyalist in Washington, Lewandowski seemed to immensely enjoy the chaos he was causing. He had an eager supporting cast in the committee\u2019s Republicans. One of those Republicans, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, had given Lewandowski a hug before the hearing began, in what proved a potent sign of what was to come.\n\nCollins, for example, charged that the Democrats\u2019 \u201coverbroad subpoenas\u201d made it difficult to focus the hearings. \u201cWe could have talked today about your favorite football team,\u201d Collins mused.", "description": "If former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski\u2019s goal during Tuesday afternoon\u2019s testimony before the House Judiciary Committee was to stonewall and frustrate Democrats, he can safely proclaim his mission accomplished.", "authors": ["Alexander Nazaryan", "National Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ddwuwdv9zLAHPukvUoIhGg--~B/aD0yMzU3O3c9MzUzNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/977d7bf0-d982-11e9-be1d-c441b33859bb", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
