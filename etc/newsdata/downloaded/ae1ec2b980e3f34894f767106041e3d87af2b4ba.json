A Downing Street source said that Johnson would \u201cstress to Mr Juncker that, while he wants to secure a deal, if no deal can be agreed by 18 October his policy is to leave without a deal on 31 October \u2013 and reject any delay offered by the EU\u201d. In turn, Juncker is expected to ask Johnson to spell out his ideas for replacing the Irish backstop, the key issue in any new Brexit deal. The lunch meeting with Juncker comes 26 days after Johnson met Angela Merkel in Berlin and declared he had 30 days to persuade the EU there was a viable alternative to the backstop. EU officials poured scorn on Johnson\u2019s assertion that, like the Incredible Hulk, he was poised to break free of the EU\u2019s \u201cmanacles\u201d. Guy Verhofstadt, the chief Brexit representative for the European parliament, tweeted that the remarks were \u201cinfantile\u201d. A bigger ticking off came from Mark Ruffalo, the actor who plays the Marvel superhero: \u201cBoris Johnson forgets that the Hulk only fights for the good of the whole. Mad and strong can also be dense and destructive,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nPeter Walker writes that Labour will face increased pressure from local party activists to adopt a more wholehearted anti-Brexit stance at its upcoming conference, according to an analysis of submitted motions, which shows 90% want the party to openly back remain in any future referendum. Meanwhile, only half of UK universities are ready for a no-deal Brexit, according to a survey by Universities UK, with 80% of universities worried about the impact of crashing out of the EU without a deal.\n\n\u2018Locked and loaded\u2019 \u2013 Donald Trump says he\u2019s ready to respond to the drone attacks on an oil processing plant in Saudi Arabia, saying he has \u201creason to believe that we know the culprit\u201d behind them. In a tweet last night Trump said the US was \u201clocked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom [of Saudi Arabia] as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed!\u201d. Meanwhile oil prices have soared in the wake of the attack to reach six-month highs. Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, gained almost $12 a barrel, reaching up to $71.95 a barrel, before dropping back to $68 a barrel. Iran denies it was behind the drone attacks on Saturday.\n\n\u2018Dehumanising\u2019 \u2013 The government\u2019s chief adviser on extremism, Sara Khan, has called the language used by Boris Johnson to describe Muslim women \u201cdemeaning\u201d and \u201cdehumanising\u201d, and warned that politicians and the media risk provoking violence through their rhetoric. Khan criticised the use of inflammatory phrases and terms such as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d and \u201csaboteurs\u201d \u2013 both of which featured in Daily Mail headlines \u2013 in political discourse. Asked if it was wrong for the prime minister to liken Muslim women wearing burqas to \u201cbank robbers\u201d and \u201cletterboxes\u201d as he did in a Daily Telegraph column in 2018, she said: \u201cPoliticians from across the divide need to be very careful of their language,\u201d adding that inflammatory language was \u201cdeeply unhelpful\u201d.\n\nFarm subsidies \u2013 Just 1% of the $700bn-a-year subsidies given to farmers is being used to benefit the environment, according to a new report by the Food and Land Use Coalition (Folu). Instead, most of it goes to promoting high-emission cattle production, forest destruction and pollution from the overuse of fertiliser. The report rejects the idea that subsidies are needed to supply cheap food and found that the cost of the damage currently caused by agriculture is greater than the value of the food produced. It also finds that producing healthy, sustainable food would actually cut food prices, as the condition of the land improved. \u201cThere is incredibly small direct targeting of [subsidies at] positive environment outcomes, which is insane,\u201d said Jeremy Oppenheim, principal at (Folu). \u201cWe have got to switch these subsidies into explicitly positive measures.\u201d\n\nWork rights \u2013 More than a million workers in Britain do not receive any of the holiday pay according to a report by the Resolution Foundation thinktank. It found that as many as one in 20 workers did not receive any holiday pay despite being legally entitled to at least 28 days a year. According to the research, almost one in 10 workers do not receive a legally required payslip, making it hard for them to calculate whether they are receiving the right level of pay, pension and holiday and to check for any deductions.\n\nRoman beef \u2013 A fourth-century Romano-British butcher\u2019s business unearthed at Ipplepen in south Devon has beefed up the case for redrawing the map of the Roman empire. Experts believe the business was set up to prepare the best cuts of beef that were transported to customers miles away along a Roman road found at the site. The discovery of a ditch full of 1,700-year-old cattle bones has undermined the notion that ancient Rome\u2019s influence had not stretched further south-west in the British Isles than Exeter, 20 miles to the north of the site.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The remains of a high-quality Romano-British butcher\u2019s business unearthed by archaeologists in Devon.

The success of The Sopranos lies in the instantly recognisable relationship between Tony and his toxic mother Livia, which its creator, David Chase, based on his relationship with his own mother. Looking back, he thinks he went overboard in characterising his childhood as bad. Was she proud of his TV career? \u201cNot particularly. She didn\u2019t understand it. My mother was a great one for saying, \u2018who do you think you are?\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Chase and the late James Gandolfini, pictured in 1999. Photograph: Jill Connelly/Associated Press\n\nHis first idea for The Sopranos came from the central dynamic between Tony and \u201cthe mother who was problematic and sent to a nursing home; she was his real enemy\u201d. A mobster-in-therapy was a funny idea, but Chase didn\u2019t see it as a sendup. He himself had been saved by therapy, which he began at 31. \u201cI was just totally selfish. And my wife said to me, \u2018You need help.\u2019\u201d Without it, he says he would almost certainly have driven away his wife, Denise Kelly, to whom he has been married for almost 50 years: \u201cShe saved my life.\u201d\n\nSport\n\nJoe Root claimed to have found the blueprint for his Test side and hailed the summer as a success after England followed up the World Cup triumph in July by denying Australia an outright Ashes win. Jonny Bairstow was again excellent behind the stumps at the Oval but his batting position must be questioned, while for a weary Steve Smith it was apparent from his body language that Australia\u2019s hero of the series was no longer piloting in perfect control. The England captain, Owen Farrell, has had to change his tackling technique amid fears of a flurry of red and yellow cards at the World Cup. In the kind of denouement script writers lie awake conjuring up, Europe pulled off a miraculous 14\u00bd-13\u00bd Solheim Cup victory over the US at Gleneagles, when Suzann Pettersen sank the final putt of the tournament to seal a home victory. And Granit Xhaka reignited the debate about Arsenal\u2019s mental toughness when he said his team had been scared during the second half of the 2-2 draw at Watford.\n\nBusiness\n\nThe UK is facing its most prolonged investment slump in 17 years, according to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), with spending due to decline 1.5% this year, fuelled by Brexit uncertainty. The length of the downturn was already poised to exceed the slump after the 2008 financial crisis, when business investment fell by a greater degree but only for two years. The BCC warned that relentless Brexit uncertainty was preventing firms from investing and diverting resources into no-deal planning.\n\nThe pound is buying \u20ac1.127 and $1.249.\n\nThe papers\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: The Guardian\n\nThe fallout from the attacks on a Saudi oil processing plant feature on the front page of the FT: \u201cSaudis seek to reassure markets as attack halves oil production\u201d and the Times: \u201cIran tells US it is ready for \u2018fully fledged war\u2019\u201d.\n\nThe Guardian has a story about \u201cSurge in UK children linked to \u2018county lines\u2019 drug gangs\u201d and the Daily Mail reports: \u201cShock rise in crime probes abandoned in 24 hours\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019re back on Brexit on the front pages of the Telegraph: \u201cJohnson confident he is closing on a deal\u201d, the Express: \u201cBrexit deal is within our grasp\u201d, and the i: \u201cJohnson\u2019s bid to save Brexit on 31 October\u201d. The Mirror has a report that Rod Stewart is in remission: \u201cRod: I have beaten cancer\u201d and the Sun says \u201cFlunkies warn Queen\u2019s guests... Don\u2019t mention Meghan\u201d.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
