I reached around to grab her bag but I couldn\u2019t grab it in time and she fell.\n\n\u2018I looked, but I could not see her because my eyes are not that good.\n\n\u2018I shouted for Hannah\u2019s mother and she came over. We tried to get down but had to go back up.\u2019\n\nAround half an hour later, Hannah was found dead at the foot of the waterfall.\n\nShe had suffered catastrophic brain injuries and an investigation found that there were no suspicious circumstances.\n\nSergeant Trevor Seed said in a report read at the inquest: \u2018They sat and talked about their future and how happy they were.\n\n\u2018It was Adam\u2019s 30th birthday the next day and they were completing the purchase of their first house.\u2019\n\nHannah Lowe was physically fit and had been a fan of climbing since she was a girl\n\n\u2018They were saying what a wonderful time they were having and how very happy they were.\n\n\u2018But as they got to their feet to return to the rest of the group Hannah lost her footing.
