He surpassed Mr Obama\u2019s third-year total just recently.\n\nBack in 2012, Mr Trump had tweeted: \u201cWhy Is @BarackObama constantly issuing executive orders that are major power grabs of authority?\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

He can\u2019t even get along with the Democrats, and he goes around signing all these executive orders. It\u2019s a basic disaster. You can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nBut Mr Trump appears to have learned what his predecessors discovered as well: It\u2019s easier and often more satisfying to get things done through administrative action than to get Congress to go along, said Andrew Rudalevige, a professor at Bowdoin College who studies the history and effectiveness of presidential executive actions.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He surpassed Mr Obama\u2019s third-year total when, in the last two weeks, he issued five executive orders relating to Medicare, government transparency, federal spending and imposing sanctions on Turkish officials.\n\nAn executive order can have the same effect as a federal law \u2014 but its impact can be fleeting. Congress can pass a new law to override an executive order and future presidents can undo them.\n\nEvery president since George Washington has used the executive order power, according to the National Constitution Centre, and some of those orders played a critical role in American history. President Franklin Roosevelt established internment camps during World War II. President Harry Truman mandated equal treatment of all members of the armed forces through executive orders. And President Dwight Eisenhower used an executive order to enforce school desegregation in Little Rock.\n\nWhen Mr Obama became frustrated with how difficult it was to push legislation through Congress, he warned Republicans he would take executive action when he considered it necessary.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I\u2019ve got a pen, and I\u2019ve got a phone.\u201d\n\nFew candidates for office have placed so much emphasis on criticising a predecessor\u2019s executive orders as Mr Trump did. He reasoned that Mr Obama\u2019s use of executive orders made him look like a weak negotiator. But Mr Trump himself has had little success with Congress in that regard. His biggest legislative achievement so far, a $1.5 trillion (\u00a31.15 trillion) tax cut, failed to gain one Democratic vote.\n\nMr Trump has so far issued 130 executive orders. By comparison, Obama issued 108 in his first three years.\n\nStill, Mr Rudalevige says that comparing executive orders from one president to the next can provide a misleading snapshot of a president\u2019s propensity for taking executive action. That\u2019s because presidents also use memoranda and proclamations to achieve policy goals or to get the message out about their priorities. One president\u2019s executive order might be another\u2019s memoranda, or phone call even.\n\nMr Obama relied on memoranda and proclamations for some of his most disputed executive actions, so just counting his executive orders understates his efforts to take action without Congress passing a bill.\n\nFor example, protections for young immigrants brought into the country illegally as children came about through a Department of Homeland Security memorandum. That effort allowed eligible individuals to request temporary relief from deportation and apply for authorisation to work in the US.\n\nMr Obama took the action after Congress had declined to pass the Dream Act, legislation that would have helped a similar group of migrants. Republicans argued Mr Obama overstepped his constitutional authority. In November, the US Supreme Court will hear arguments over the Trump administration\u2019s plan to end the program, which has protected roughly 700,000 young immigrants from deportation. Lower courts have so far blocked the administration from ending the program.\n\nMr Obama also issued proclamations to declare new national monuments in Utah and Nevada in his final days in office. In all, he issued 34 monument proclamations, including designating 29 new monuments and enlargement of five existing monuments as he brandished his conservation legacy. Some of the largest monument designations were heavily criticised by state and local officials.\n\nMr Rudalevige said that Mr Trump appears to favour the pomp and ceremony that often comes with an executive order. He routinely makes a speech, administration officials and potentially affected Americans get to thank him for taking action and Mr Trump often signs the order before the cameras, holding it up in the air for photographers to capture the moment.\n\n\u201cI think it fits his personality,\u201d Mr Rudalevige said.\n\nAssociated Press", "description": "It wasn\u2019t too long ago that Donald Trump derided presidential executive orders as \u201cpower grabs\u201d and a \u201cbasic disaster.\u201d He\u2019s switched sides in a big way: In each year of his presidency, he has issued more executive orders than did former President Barack Obama during the same time span.
