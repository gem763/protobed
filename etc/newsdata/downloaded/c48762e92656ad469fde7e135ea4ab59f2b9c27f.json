They were regarded as endangered, but were reclassified as \"vulnerable\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, following an increase in numbers.\n\nChina loans the animals to countries around the world as a way of strengthening diplomatic ties.\n\nThere's extensive reporting in China about the animals' lives overseas, and Chuang Chuang's early death has received widespread coverage in state media.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Panda diplomacy: China's cutest peacemakers\n\nAccording to Chinese news agency Xinhua, an investigation will be carried out to establish the cause of death, and experts from the China Conservation and Research Centre will travel to Chiang Mai to work with their Thai counterparts.\n\nSome social media users on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo were concerned, saying: \"Thailand is not suitable for raising pandas\", and \"they don't treat animals as well as we think\".\n\nOthers asked for the remaining female panda in Chiang Mai, Lin Hui, to be returned to China.\n\nChuang Chuang had been at the Chiang Mai zoo since 2003, alongside his female companion.\n\nFailing to show any sexual interest in Lin Hui, the zoo tried various methods to boost his sex drive, including putting him on a low-carb diet, and showing videos of mating pandas.\n\nWith all efforts failing, the zoo eventually resorted to artificial insemination and Lin Hui gave birth in 2009.", "description": "The death of Chuang Chuang, who was famous for efforts to stimulate his sex drive, has caused anger.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4FA0/production/_108848302_a0d15811-30d8-4a51-8dd3-ab45f3dbc387.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
