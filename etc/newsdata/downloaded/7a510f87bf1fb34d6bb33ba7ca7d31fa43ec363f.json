The trend toward convenience and low prices has elevated discounters and big box stores, but it\u2019s left other retailers in a riskier position, having to continually prove themselves\u2014or else.\n\nBest Buy (BBY), for instance, fell 8.8% on Thursday, even after reporting better-than-expected earnings. The problem was that growth in sales at stores open at least a year fell short of expectations, while results were weak in key categories like gaming. Investors chose to overlook a surge in appliance sales, a trend that\u2019s probably unsustainable because Best Buy competes with Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) in that category. And tariffs could cause a particularly big headache for the chain: Imports from China account for 60% of its cost of goods, Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem estimates. No wonder Best Buy lowered the upper end of the range of sales it forecast for the full year, implying that it might face challenges in the holiday season.\n\nOther specialists have also struggled.\n\nTiffany (TIF) stock wobbled on Wednesday after management reported higher earnings than expected, but said that the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong had disrupted business there, among other challenges. The shares ended the day higher, but are up just 6% for the year.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA), which we recommended in this space last week (and wish we hadn\u2019t), tumbled nearly 30% after missing earnings forecasts and lowering its guidance. \u201cFor a company that has been one of the most consistent models across our universe over the past five-plus years, today\u2019s results were about as shocking as one could imagine,\u201d Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow wrote on Thursday. He downgraded Ulta to Market Perform from Outperform.\n\nDiscounters, however, continue to impress Wall Street. Dollar stores and their ilk have proven they can flourish in good times and bad, and are some of the few retail concepts that continue to expand.\n\n\u201cAgainst a somewhat volatile consumer sector backdrop, we see increased investor appetite for recession-resistant and defensive stories,\u201d wrote Credit Suisse analyst Judah Frommer. Five Below (FIVE) was up 5.2%, as of Thursday afternoon, even though same-store sales fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations. Also on Thursday, Dollar General (DG) reported results that were much better than expected, sending the stock up 10%. Burlington Stores (BURL), another Barron\u2019s pick, soared 18%.\n\nInvestors have been impressed with how the discount chains are managing looming tariffs. All of them rely on China for their goods to one degree or another, but have clearly been rethinking their supply chains. \u201cWe\u2019ve negotiated price concessions, canceled orders, modified specs, evolved product mix, and diversified vendors,\u201d says Gary Philbin, CEO of Dollar Tree (DLTR), which fell 1.2% after reporting mixed earnings.\n\nBut among its peers, Dollar General is likely to weather the storm best. It doesn\u2019t obtain as many goods from China.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Dollar General is uniquely positioned, relative to most retailers, to manage these tariffs for three reasons,\u201d wrote Guggenheim analyst John Heinbockel. \u201cOne, it operates with a sales mix heavily skewed to consumables\u201475%\u2014that are not subject to China tariffs. Two, we believe it has healthy comp momentum\u20143%-4%\u2014with which to leverage most operating costs. Three, it will cycle significant promotional investments in the fourth quarter, which should bolster profitability in the most important period of the year.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to retail, the best bets are still in stories offering the best bargains.\n\nWrite to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.com", "description": "Specialist retailers like Best Buy and Tiffany have had a harder time.", "authors": ["Avi Salzman"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-102520/social"}
