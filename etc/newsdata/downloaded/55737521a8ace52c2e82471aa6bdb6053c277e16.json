But some of those movies that dramatically flopped are finding a modicum of new life through digital.\n\nEvery week, Fandango Now provides Business Insider with its top movies that people are renting or buying through the service. Fandango Now is movie-ticket service Fandango's on-demand video service, in which viewers can rent or buy from a selection of over 900,00 movies on digital, including recent theatrical releases, without a subscription. It's available on platforms including desktop, Roku, Chromecast, Movies Anywhere, and Apple and Android mobile devices.\n\nREAD MORE: We compared the top movie franchises at 6 major Hollywood studios, from Disney to Paramount\n\nThis week includes blockbusters like \"Toy Story 4\" and \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" as well as movies that failed to attract audiences while in theaters, such as the comedy \"Stuber\" and the \"X-Men\" movie \"Dark Phoenix.\" It suggests that audiences are far more willing to watch a movie they are hesitant of on digital at a lower cost than they are to go to the theater.\n\nWe've included the percentage of the total of buys/rentals the movie has on Fandango Now. A lower percentage doesn't necessarily mean it's not desirable, just that bigger or newer movies are making up a larger percentage.
