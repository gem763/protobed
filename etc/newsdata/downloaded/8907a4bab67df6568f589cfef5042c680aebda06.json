And work it does work brilliantly, most of the time.\n\nThe newly designed pencil is also now far more useful as you can magnetically store and charge it on the side of the iPad, with a satisfying click\n\nApple's redesigned Pencil is definitely more attractive to the average user\n\nI found it far more reliable than even the iPhone, and given people tend to use their iPad at weird angles (this really is the perfect machine for watching Netflix in bed on), this is a good thing.\n\nThe only slight gripe is that, as a left hander, when the iPad is in its keyboard case, quite often my arm would obstruct the camera, throwing up a \u2018camera is covered\u2019 message.\n\nHowever, the iPad quickly tries again, and nearly always worked perfectly on the second attempt.\n\nOne other interesting point about the new design is that, for most of the time, it's hard to tell what way up you\u2019re holding the iPad.\n\nHowever, the only time I found this a problem was occasionally using the iPad in bed to read, and finding the camera at the bottom was covered.\n\nOne interesting point about the new screen and edge to edge design is that it makes the larger size, with a 12.9inch screen, far more manageable - I struggled with the older version to travel with it as it was just a little too big.\n\nThe new version however, feels smaller - although to be honest, I do still prefer the smaller one, but then I tend to use my iPad for browsing, watching video and reading, rather than anything more high powered.\n\nApple has even improved its keyboard case, adding in protection for the back of the iPad, and two positions for the screen - although it does add a little bit more bulk.\n\nFor anyone using an iPad for work, however, the larger screen is a godsend, and makes everything from drawing to emails a dream, particularly with the ability to split the screen.\n\nApple\u2019s general thinning down of the design does mean the new iPad feels very different, and more like the sheet of glass Apple is aiming for.\n\nIt's easier to carry without a case, and feels safe and secure - more so than the previously, curved edge version, I found.\n\nThe new iPad pros are 5.9mm thin, making them 25% less volume than the previous version.\n\nThe newly designed pencil is also now far more useful as you can magnetically store and charge it on the side of the iPad, with a satisfying click. It\u2019s definitely going to make the Pencil more attractive to the average user - although do bear it mind it\u2019ll probably fall off it you put it into your bag still attached.\n\nThere are also changes to power, with USB-C now being used to recharge. This isn\u2019t a problem if you\u2019ve already got a recent Macbook, and I was able to use by existing laptop charger (although obviously there\u2019s a charger in the box anyway).\n\nUSB-C also allows you to plug the iPad into a monitor easily, and this opens up whole new ways of using it - for instance, video and photo editing can be done on a bigger screen, using the iPad screen as a control panel.\n\nHowever, one omission is the headphone socket - which is a shame, but also seemed pretty inevitable given the same move with the iPhone.\n\nOne interesting point about the new screen and edge to edge design is that it makes the larger size, with a 12.9inch screen, far more manageable - I struggled with the older version to travel with it as it was just a little too big.\n\nFor professional apps, it once again blurs the line between tablet and \u2018real\u2019 computer.\n\nThe processing speed of the new Pros is astonishing. Apple boasts they are now faster than most desktop and laptop PCs on the market, and it really shows.\n\nSome of the demos Apple showed off were just jaw dropping, and you get the impression the sheer power of the new A12X powered the device will revolutionise creative apps.\n\nThis can already be seen in the full version of Photoshop Adobe has demoed, along with some of the games coming the the new device.\n\nThe processing speed of the new Pros is astonishing. Apple boasts they are now faster than most desktop and laptop PCs on the market, and it really shows.\n\nThe one thing holding back the iPad is software - in the short term, at least, is softare. There\u2019s a huge amount of potential here, and one gets the feeling developers will take a while to take advantage of the processing power.\n\niOS itself also feels a little stale, particularly the app layout, which leaves huge amounts of unused space - but if the rumours are to believed, iOS 13 could address this.\n\nApple has even improved its keyboard case, adding in protection for the back of the iPad, and two positions for the screen - although it does add a little bit more bulk.\n\nCrucially, the new Pro is enough of a boost in speed and design for existing users to want to upgrade, and it does feel like a big step forward for the iPad.\n\nIt is, it must be said, also one of the most expensive tablets out there, and rather like Apple's XS, feels like a luxury, no expenses spared device\n\nOverall, the new iPads really do blur the line between devices - and for the majority of users, there really is no reason to buy a traditional laptop over the iPad anymor", "description": "Apple's new iPad is blazingly fast, gorgeous to look at, and quite simply the best tablet out there - and for a lot of people, probably the best computer out there.", "authors": ["Mark Prigg For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/05/16/5714666-0-image-a-4_1541433833995.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-05"}
