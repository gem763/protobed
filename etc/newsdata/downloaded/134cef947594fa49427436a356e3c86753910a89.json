The eggs in question were marked with the British Lion stamp, which is supposed to guarantee they are safe.\n\nSalmonella can cause food poisoning, and in the most severe cases can be fatal. There have been no deaths in this outbreak. Previously the FSA had insisted British Lion eggs were safe to eat raw, even for pregnant women, children and the elderly.\n\nIt has now emerged that regulations designed to ensure high standards in the UK egg sector were breached several thousand times by farms, packing stations and wholesalers over the last three years, according to records seen by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Guardian.\n\nInspection records have shown that more than a hundred tests for salmonella had been missed, or carried out too late, increasing the chance of contaminated eggs entering the food chain.\n\nOver three years egg farms in England had more than 100 breaches of the rules around the government\u2019s programme to prevent salmonella.\n\nSome offending farms were issued with penalty notices, which can result in a fine or other enforcement action.\n\nDozens of people poisoned this year by salmonella-infected British eggs Read more\n\nThe records \u2013 compiled by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) \u2013 also show that one in six of all inspections carried out in the past three years found infractions on issues including hygiene, animal welfare and egg quality.\n\nEnsuring farms are regularly cleaned and disinfected, alongside strict pest control and biosecurity measures, is key to preventing salmonella, which can be spread by contaminated wild birds and animals, in water, and via farm workers.\n\nA single lapse in hygiene could introduce salmonella on to a farm or enable the pathogens to spread, industry sources have said.\n\nLast week an investigation revealed how a major outbreak of one of the worst strains of salmonella had affected several farms and two egg-packing factories, including one that supplies major supermarkets.\n\nMore than 50 egg-laying flocks were found to have tested positive for salmonella since January 2018, 11 of them contaminated with the most serious strains of the bacteria. Egg-packing factories were also found contaminated on five occasions in the period.\n\nAlmost all of the 13bn eggs eaten in the UK come from British farms. More than half of the market comes from free-range hens, while most of the rest is from birds in \u201cenriched cages\u201d \u2013 indoor enclosures for dozens of birds with perching spaces and scratching areas.\n\nThe salmonella outbreak revealed by the Bureau is understood to have affected some free-range egg farms.\n\nThe government confirmed on Friday that it was \u201cinvestigating and taking action\u201d to control the outbreak along with industry and local authorities. In its food alert the FSA said there was a \u201cpotential but low risk of illness\u201d and advised people to cook their eggs thoroughly to eliminate the bug.\n\nA spokesperson for the APHA said: \u201cAll egg producers are subject to rigorous and regular inspections to ensure standards are being met and to minimise the risk to public health. If any producers are found to have hygiene breaches or fail to carry out salmonella testing, we will not hesitate to take action to bring them into compliance with our strict regulations. We prevent producers selling whole table eggs if their flocks are confirmed to have regulated strains of salmonella which endanger human health.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman stated that the numbers of breaches cover a period of three years and take in more than 8000 inspections. \u201cThe risk of contaminated eggs being allowed into market is very small\u2026 Flock prevalence of regulated serovars (variations of salmonella) in UK laying flocks is very low, ranging between 0.09% and 0.16% in the 3 years under consideration.\u201d\n\nResponding to the revelations, Professor Erik Millstone, a food safety expert at Sussex University, said: \u201cIf 100 cases of salmonella poisoning from UK eggs has not been sufficient to withdraw the advice that UK produced eggs can safely be eaten raw, how many will be enough? How many people will need to get sick before the advice will be changed?\u201d\n\nKerry McCarthy, a Labour MP, said the investigation served as an \u201curgent warning\u201d to the poultry industry, government and consumers to avoid complacency. \u201cWhile progress has been made on controlling salmonella in eggs \u2026 one case is a case too many.\u201d\n\nC\u00f3il\u00edn Nunan, scientific advisor to the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, told the Guardian the problem was still less serious than in previous major outbreaks. \u201cThere is far less salmonella in [laying hens] than there was back in the 1980s and 1990s and it isn\u2019t true that it was ever eradicated, but the overall threat to human health from salmonella in eggs is a lot less than it used to be. There is however a continuing problem with salmonella in poultry and other species, which continues to lead to human infections, including antibiotic-resistant infections.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian contacted the British Egg Council for comment but received no reply.\n\nHygiene on farms and food safety for consumers are sensitive issues for the government at present, as difficulties over checks on livestock and farm produce are a major factor in Brexit negotiations over the Irish border, while consumers and farmers are concerned that looser trade rules after Brexit may result in imports of food from farms with lower animal welfare or hygiene standards from overseas.", "description": "Warning follows joint investigation that uncovered hundreds of regulation breaches by farms, packing stations and wholesalers", "authors": ["Andrew Wasley", "Alexandra Heal", "Fiona Harvey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4939e9f0947c763b6878db24f9161558aa7b4ba6/0_178_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=99a045cc6feaaa092e7fa0ce9e364348", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
