Clayton County Georgia and Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarada were brought by homosexual men who claimed they were fired because of their sexual orientation.\n\nR.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC centers on a man who was fired after he announced he had changed his name and would now be coming to work as a woman. The business\u2019s sex-specific dress code required women to wear skirts as their work uniform.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch had an exchange with David Cole, attorney for Aimee Stephens, who was William Stephens for the six years he worked at the funeral home, first as an apprentice and then as a funeral director and embalmer.\n\nCole said that Stephens would have been fired even if he complied with the dress code for women in the funeral home because he was a man, a clear case of sex discrimination, he argued. Gorsuch said:\n\nI guess I \u2014 I\u2019d just like you to have a chance to respond to Judge Lynch in his thoughtful dissent in which he lamented everything you have before us, but suggested that something as drastic a change in this country as bathrooms in every place of employment and dress codes in every place of employment that are otherwise gender neutral would be changed, that that \u2014 that that\u2019s an essentially legislative decision.\n\n\u201cJudge Lynch is a very thoughtful judge and \u2014 and wrote a very thoughtful opinion that I \u2014 I think he probably regretted having to write,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cWhat do you say to him?\u201d\n\nCole said:\n\nI say that recognizing that transgender people have a right to exist in the workplace and not be turned away because of who they are does not end dress codes or restrooms. There are transgender lawyers in this courtroom today.\n\n\u201cOf course, there are,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the question, Mr. Cole.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Cole, the question is a matter of the judicial role and the modesty in interpreting statutes that are old. And that\u2019s the question he posed,\u201d Gorsuch said.\n\n\u201cNobody is questioning, and he certainly did not, the legitimacy of the claims and the importance of them,\u201d Gorsuch said.\n\n\u201cThe question is about judicial interpretation,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cIf you wish to address it.\u201d\n\nCole said that the Plaintiff was not asking to change the definition of sex as it was defined in 1964 but argued that it was because of his sex as a man who wanted \u201cto present\u201d as a woman that caused the termination.\n\nGorsuch responded that the case could be close on the \u201ctextual\u201d review of the 1964 law but that social implications are much broader. He said:\n\nAt the end of the day, should he or she take into consideration the massive social upheaval that would be entailed in such a decision, and the possibility that \u2014 that Congress didn\u2019t think about it. That is more effective \u2014 more appropriate a legislative rather than a judicial function?\n\nBut Cole argued transgenders are not \u201cdisruptive.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, first of all, federal courts of appeals have been recognizing that discrimination against transgender people is sex discrimination for 20 years,\u201d Cole said. \u201cThere\u2019s been no upheaval.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I was saying, there are transgender male lawyers in this courtroom following the male dress code and going to the men\u2019s room and the Court\u2019s dress code and sex-segregated restrooms have not fallen,\u201d Cole added.\n\n\u201cSo the notion that somehow this is going to be a huge upheaval, we haven\u2019t seen that upheaval for 20 years, there\u2019s no reason you \u2014 you would see that upheaval,\u201d Cole said. \u201cTransgender people follow the rule that\u2019s associated with their gender identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not disruptive,\u201d Cole said.\n\nIn previewing the cases, Steven D. Schwinn, professor of law at the University of Illinois Chicago John Marshall Law School, said that the court\u2019s ruling \u201cmatters deeply to the estimated 11.3 million LGBTQ adults in the United States.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cemployers, the government and their amici argue that the plaintiff\u2019s reading of Title VII would so \u2018expand\u2019 the concept of \u201csex\u201d that employers would not know show to comply, and courts would not know how to enforce it.\u201d\n\nSchwinn wrote:\n\nMoreover, the defendants and their amici argue that the plaintiffs\u2019 reading of Title VII could mean the end of things like sex-specific restrooms and locker rooms and this could actually undermine Title VII by threatening other sex specific practices and institutions that are designed to provide an equal playing field between men and women.\n\nThese cases are Bostock v. Clayton County Georgia, No. 17-1618, Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, No. 17-1623, and R.G. &G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC, No. 18-107 in the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday heard oral arguments asking the court to expand federal sex discrimination law to protect gays and transgenders.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/04/wi/ap/21/20ac3dm.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
