You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFollowing the death of 39 people in a lorry this week, attention has been drawn to what Europol previously described as the \u201ctremendous amount of crossover\u201d between smugglers transporting people across borders and gangs ensnaring people for forced sexual and labour exploitation.\n\nCriminal gangs, often installed in migrant encampments in Calais and other ports, profit from the desperation of refugees by charging them money to attempt boarding lorries. In cases where children cannot pay, they give them so-called \u201cdebts\u201d, which can be paid off in the form of \u201cwork\u201d once they reach the UK, according to charities.\n\nBritain currently uses a number of EU-wide databases, including Schengen Information System (SIS II), to report and investigate such activity, as well as missing children, across Europe, but after Brexit this access is likely to be either reduced or removed completely.\n\nChild protection experts said that while the current mechanisms in place were in need of improvement, the expected loss of safe routes and reduced law enforcement cooperation after Brexit would cause the system to \u201ccompletely fall apart\u201d, placing more young people at risk.\n\n\u201cThings are not anywhere near perfect, but this just means things are going to go backwards instead of forwards in terms of being able to strengthen cooperation between member states with regards to safeguarding children,\u201d said Laura Duran, senior policy and research officer at Ecpat UK (Every Child Protected Against Trafficking).\n\n\u201cThere will be very little initiative or methods to investigate the human rights violations committed against them on the law enforcement side of things.\u201d\n\nMs Duran said the loss of the family reunion route to the UK would compound this, saying the lack of a legal route for children would make them \u201cmuch more likely to take dangerous journeys\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The consequences are huge in terms of there will be no legal options we can advocate for, and we are fearful that we\u2019ll see many more cases of trafficking and fatalities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe also know that the process of getting onto this legal route is not easy, it\u2019s not child-centred, so to get them to buy into it is really, so difficult, within a community where they believe they\u2019ll pass quicker on a lorry.\u201d\n\nMr Aldred said that a particular worry when children crossed the Channel on lorries or boats with the help of smugglers was that they remain in danger once they reached the UK, as they are often not known to any public authority.\n\n\u201cA real fear is that once they enter the UK, the situation is often not better for them. The visibility they had here goes, which leaves them at the mercy of those who want to exploit them, especially if they don\u2019t enter into child protection and declare themselves, they\u2019re fundamentally invisible,\u201d he said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 39 bodies found in lorry container in Essex Show all 15 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.
