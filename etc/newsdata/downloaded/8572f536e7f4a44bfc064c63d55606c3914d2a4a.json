Or is she saying it is Rebekah\u2019s account? When I read that, although the end bit talks about it being the account, there\u2019s a couple of uses of the word \u201cperson\u201d beforehand, I think there\u2019s a good argument that is saying it is Rebekah, or at least very likely it is Rebekah.\n\nShe is carrying out a forensic investigation (Picture: David Fisher/REX)\n\n\u2018At that point, Rebekah has a claim. But where does that take her? That takes her to court where we will establish if it\u2019s true or not.\u2019\n\nHe went on: \u2018Everything on the internet is traceable to an individual, so we will be able to find out one way or another whether this was someone using Rebekah\u2019s account without permission, or if it was her with the data behind it.\u2019\n\nVictoria asked: \u2018So you can pinpoint exactly how you can find out who has had access to your account?\u2019\n\nTo which Phil replied: \u2018Yes, Rebekah will be able to go to Instagram and ask \u201cwhich time and date my Instagram was accessed,\u201d they will say for example, \u201c10am on this Monday and someone accessed your account using this broadband account, say BT.\u201d\u2018\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u2018So then we will go to BT and ask for the address that had that account, so we will get an address and get down to a person in a house.\n\nColeen has accused Rebekah of selling stories (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018And it\u2019s true, with everything on the internet, if you look hard enough you can find out who it is.\u2019\n\nThe comments come after Coleen\u2019s furious rant on Twitter where she accused Rebekah of selling stories about her life to the press \u2013 something Rebekah has denied.\n\nShe said: \u2018There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account.\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Coleen Rooney (@coleen_rooney) on Oct 9, 2019 at 2:29am PDT\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nRebekah insisted: \u2018I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n\u2018If you thought this was happening you could have told me and I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.\n\n\u2018Over the years various people have had access to my Insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself.\u2019\n\nShe said she was \u2018so upset\u2019 over the scandal and was struggling to deal with the stress of it all while pregnant.\n\nThe star added: \u2018I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019\n\nA spokesman for Coleen later insisted: \u2018It is irrefutable that the leaks came from one account, and one account only.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
