Prices have turned in Melbourne and Sydney which probably brings the investor back into the market.\"\n\nDr Debelle estimated that the overall downturn in residential construction would subtract around 1 percentage point from GDP growth from peak to trough, given that dwelling investment accounts for around 6 per cent of GDP. But the broader economic impact could be more.\n\nHe said that the concern was that many smaller operators would not survive this downturn and that had big consequences for the broader economy.\n\n\"Gross mixed income, which is primarily small business income, declined by 3.8 per cent over the past year...a sizeable part is low income growth from contractors in the residential construction sector. This has contributed to the overall historically low growth in household incomes.\"\n\n\"We estimate that this explains around half of the recent slowing in consumption.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also addressed lending conditions suggesting that banks had not created a credit squeeze and that it was more demand driven rather than supply.\n\n\"The slowdown in housing credit growth to households has primarily reflected the housing cycle rather than driven it. That is, the slowdown in credit growth is primarily a demand story rather than a supply story.\"\n\nAlthough he did note a slowdown in credit for small businesses.\n\n\"While I believe that the slowdown in housing credit is more a result of weaker demand than tighter supply, I said last November \u2018the effect of a tightening in lending to developers seems to me to be a higher risk to the economic outlook than the direct effect of the tighter lending standards on households...\"\n\n\"Relatedly, there may also be a bigger impact on lending to small business given the extensive use of property as collateral for small business loans. This still is very much the case nearly twelve months on.\"\n\nThe deputy governor also said the housing construction downturn was a key determinant of low inflation readings at the moment and a reason why the central bank had cut interest rates by 75 basis points to 0.75 per cent.\n\n\"One other area where the spillover from housing to the rest of the economy has been larger than we had expected is its impact on inflation.\"\n\n\"The two largest housing-related components of the consumer price index basket are rents and new dwelling purchases by owner-occupiers, which together account for around one-sixth of the CPI basket,\" he said.\n\nDr Debelle also mentioned the level of negative equity in households was quite low even after having risen because of the fall in home prices up to May this year.\n\n\"We estimate that around 3.75 per cent of mortgage balances [by value] are in negative equity, up from around 2 per cent a year ago.\"", "description": "Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle said a shortfall in housing supply was \"quite likely\" in the foreseeable future and that would trigger a \"larger price response\" in property values.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1839%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fb5343d15d90f6993b6212e42aee28e5b4b71941", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
