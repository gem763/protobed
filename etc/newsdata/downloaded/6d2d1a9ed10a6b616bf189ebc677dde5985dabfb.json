Bush. It became infamous in the interim for being used by the government to arbitrarily and indefinitely detainee foreign-born prisoners, and Democrats including Mr. Obama have unsuccessfully tried for years to have it closed.\n\nMr. Obama had campaigned on shuttering the detention camp, but multiple attempts to follow through as president were blocked by Republicans on Capitol Hill. Instead, he nearly emptied it before his administration ended, releasing all but 40 detainees prior to leaving office in early 2017.\n\n\u201cMembers of Congress who obstruct efforts to close the facility, given the stakes involved for our security, have abdicated their responsibility to the American people,\u201d Mr. Obama wrote in a terse letter sent to congressional leaders during his last day in the White House. \u201cThey have placed politics above the ongoing costs to taxpayers, our relationships with our allies and the threat posed to U.S. national security by leaving open a facility that governments around the world condemn and which hinders rather than helps our fight against terrorism.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump took an opposite stance from Mr. Obama when he campaigned to succeed him in 2016, vowing at the time to \u201ckeep it open\u201d and \u201cload it up with some bad news.\u201d The real estate mogul raised concerns about the cost on the campaign trail, however, saying at the time that he would like to make running the prison more affordable.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
