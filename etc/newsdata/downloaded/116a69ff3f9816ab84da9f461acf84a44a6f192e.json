It also comes amidst growing angst in tech and financial sectors about her growing popularity in polls\n\nUnder the the Massachusetts senator's legislative proposal, companies that spend between $500,000 and $1 million per year on lobbying Congress and federal agencies would pay a 35% tax on those expenditures.\n\nFor every dollar above $1 million spent on lobbying, the rate will increase to 60% \u2013 and for every dollar above $5 million, it would increase to 75%, Warren explained in a Medium post. Under data compiled from the Center for Responsive Politics, Warren\u2019s proposal would have resulted in companies such as Koch Industries, Pfizer, Boeing, Microsoft, Walmart, and Exxon being subject to the 75% rate for lobbying spending above $5 million in every year over the last decade.\n\nWarren in March unveiled a plan that called for regulators to roll back big tech mergers such as Amazon acquiring Whole Foods and Facebook purchasing the messaging platform WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nWarren then slammed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Tuesday after The Verge published leaked audio in which he lamented that if Warren were elected president Facebook would find itself caught in a legal battle with U.S. government.\n\nIn this file photo taken on September 19, 2019 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg walks to meetings for technology regulations and social media issues on Capitol Hill, in Washington, DC. - Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has pledged to More\n\n\"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" Zuckerberg said in the audio that was among snippets from two meetings held with Facebook employees in July. \"And does that still suck for us? Yeah.\"\n\nBig tech clash: Warren hits back at Facebook's Zuckerberg after he criticized her plan to break up big tech\n\nMore: Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders slam Big Tech but their campaigns spend heavily on them\n\nShe took to Twitter last week to push back against a CNBC report citing anonymous Democratic Wall Street donors who told the financial network they would sit out the election or support Trump in Warren becomes the nominee.\n\n\u201cI'm fighting for an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cI'm not afraid of anonymous quotes, and wealthy donors don't get to buy this process. I won't back down from fighting for the big, structural change we need.\u201d\n\nWarren has steadily climbed in the polls. She hovered in the single-digit percentages in most national and early voting states\u2019 polls early in the year. Two recent polls \u2014 one in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa and a national survey of voters \u2014 found her slightly ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nWhere would the money go\n\nWarren says revenue generated by her lobbying tax would be poured into a \u201cLobby Defense Trust Fund\u201d that would be used to reinstate the dormant Office of Technology Assessment and increase the budget for congressional support agencies, such as the Congressional Budget Office. The senator said she\u2019d also push to have revenue used to fund a public advocate\u2019s office tasked with helping Americans \u201cengage with federal agencies and fight for the public interest in the rule-making process.\u201d", "description": "Warren\u2019s proposal\u00a0 would have resulted in companies such as Pfizer, Microsoft, Walmart, and Exxon \u2013 being subject to a 75% rate for lobbying spending.", "authors": ["Aamer Madhani", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VGBR5mLLcZPluw3xMepcPA--~B/aD0zMDAwO3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/215dd4c305968c0e5eb965d72ab35720", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
