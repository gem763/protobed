A proper talent for taking the best out of the car in qualifying, a proper talent for taking the best out of the car in the race, a proper feeling of the car in the wet. I think he is a complete driver.\n\n\u201cIt is something that you could see when Ayrton Senna was driving, when Michael Schumacher was racing and winning everything. (Juan Manuel) Fangio as well, Jackie Stewart. He is absolutely complete.\u201d\n\nHowever, Massa has warned that the impending rule changes that are proposed for 2021 could end the dominance of Mercedes in F1.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMassa sits in the world council meetings that decide on rule changes in his role as president of the CIK for karting.\n\nBut while he understands change could be frustrating for Hamilton, they are essential for the future of the sport.\n\n\u201cThe mentality is that they have to change, or the sport can die,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe changes need to be done for the sport, for the budget. Nobody can spend that amount of money anymore - even the big companies.\n\n\u201cThis can make a big effect at the end, and for the show. Something needs to be done.\u201d\n\n(Image: GETTY)\n\nAs for Hamilton, Massa added: \u201cYou always need to wait and see which car he is going to have. This is the most important thing - you have to have the car to win. If he has the car to win, he can make the difference as a driver.\n\n\u201cMaybe next year he can have the car to win, because the rules remain the same.\n\n\u201cThe year after, the rules will change so we need to wait and see, but I really believe that he can beat all the records.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Massa, who now drives in the ever-growing Formula E, believes that Hamilton will go on to break every possible record", "authors": ["Aaron Flanagan", "Image", "Reuters", "Afp Getty Images", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20726841.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Formula-One-F1-Mexican-Grand-Prix.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
