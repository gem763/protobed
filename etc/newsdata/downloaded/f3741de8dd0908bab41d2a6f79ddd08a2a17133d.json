No, he's not the reason one way or the other they got there. Current Nats explain. USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2013 Just to be certain, He Who Is Not Here is hardly looming over the proceedings at Minute Maid Park.\n\nAt the same time, as the Washington Nationals play in their first World Series, Bryce Harper is out of sight, but rarely out of the minds of casual observers wondering how a franchise could lose its icon and go where it never has.\n\nHarper\u2019s departure to the Philadelphia Phillies for a $330 million contract his old club was not willing to match, followed by said club\u2019s 93-win grind of a season and stunning 8-2 march to the National League pennant creates the temptation to oversimplify.\n\nWith Harper: Nationals can\u2019t get out of first round.\n\nWithout: Unstoppable playoff force.\n\nWith Harper: Dugout choke holds.\n\nWithout: Dugout dance parties.\n\nBut of course, it\u2019s never that simple.\n\nFor one, the Nationals chose wisely in spending $140 million on free agent lefty Patrick Corbin, creating a pitching-heavy roster that has mostly dominated opponents in a manner Gio Gonzalez and Co. never could in October.\n\nThe Nationals also enjoyed the fortune of good sequencing. In short: It all went to hell early on, from a bullpen that turned the eighth inning into a nightly hallucination to a rash of early injuries that sidelined stalwarts Trea Turner, Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto.\n\nLittle wonder they started the year 19-31 \u2013 and that their fortunes turned when the big boys came back and the bullpen was repaired.\n\nWORLD SERIES: Aces give this Fall Classic an old-school feel\n\nRENDON: Nationals' MVP candidate back in his hometown\n\nThe Nationals made the playoffs in four of Harper\u2019s seven seasons; his .900 career OPS is the best in the franchise\u2019s Washington history, and he was the 2015 NL MVP.\n\n\u201cHe played great. He did a lot of things people have never done from ages 19 to 25, so he deserves everything that he got,\u201d says veteran infielder Ryan Zimmerman.\n\nSoto, who like Harper debuted at 19 and proceeded to put up historic numbers for his age, won\u2019t soon forget the manner in which No. 34 eased his transition to the bigs upon debuting in May 2018.\n\n\u201cHe was always right there for me,\u201d Soto said of Harper. \u201cThat was the first guy I saw when I come up here \u2013 he just gave me a hug and said \u2018Hey, anything you need, we\u2019re going to be here.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really sad we lost him, but we have to keep going, we have to keep playing baseball. We play as a team and try to play baseball and enjoy.\u201d\n\nThat they did, finishing 74-38 after their dismal start to claim the NL\u2019s top wild-card spot.\n\nA fan mocks Bryce Harper during the NLCS. (Photo: Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nHarper wasn\u2019t as fortunate, at least on the field. The Phillies finished 81-81, fired manager Gabe Kapler and for now lack the bedrock of starting pitching that will make the Nationals and New York Mets almost certain contenders in 2020.\n\nOff the field? The Nationals know he\u2019s rich in more than just a monetary sense.\n\n\u201cBryce did so much for this organization and he even said it \u2013 he made the best decision for his family,\u201d says Rendon, a pending free agent who may be playing his final games as a National himself. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for him. I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled for him and they welcomed a child into this world as well.\u201d\n\nBut what about that whole can\u2019t-win-a-playoff-series curse \u2013 and not even making the playoffs his final year?\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s so hard to make the playoffs,\u201d Rendon insists, \u201cas much as everybody thinks it\u2019s so easy. And they think, \u2018It\u2019s not that hard to win a Division Series, and do this, do that.'\n\n\u201cThe amount of games we play, the grind we endure, it\u2019s tough.\u201d\n\nThey fought through this year, with second-year manager Dave Martinez finding his groove, midseason acquisition Gerardo Parra gaining considerable clubhouse and cultural currency with his gregarious nature and kid-friendly walk-up jam.\n\nEven typically laconic ace Stephen Strasburg seemed like a different man this year, waltzing with Parra after winning the NL pennant and partaking in the perfunctory dugout dance party after a startling home run.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of guys who like to have a lot of fun,\u201d Strasburg said by way of explaining his apparently newfound exuberance. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not one to be a Debbie Downer.\u201d\n\nTuesday night, the Nationals will soak in all that comes with a World Series appearance, and should they snag a game off the Houston Astros here, can count on a raucous welcome at Nationals Park for Friday\u2019s Game 3.\n\nAs Zimmerman glanced around at the media throngs and the field below, October legends waiting to be made, he pondered the future of his old mate. Fourteen years is a long time \u2013 long enough for fortunes to turn, and, perhaps, for everyone to have a happy ending.\n\n\u201cI hope he obviously has an unbelievable career,\u201d Zimmerman said of Harper, \u201cand gets to do this.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some part of me that somehow thinks he will.\u201d", "description": "After homegrown superstar Bryce Harper left for Philadelphia, the Washington Nationals pulled off a miraculous run to the World Series.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published A.M.
