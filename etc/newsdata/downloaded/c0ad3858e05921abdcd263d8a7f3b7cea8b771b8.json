That it got up and running again so quickly masked the lasting damage wrought by the storm waters. Since then, the MTA has been methodically rehabilitating its assets.\n\nOf the nine subway tunnels inundated by Sandy, the MTA has repaired and strengthened seven. The MTA\u2019s two car tunnels \u2014 the Queens Midtown and the Hugh L. Carey \u2014 now have 25-ton floodgates. The MTA has devised temporary anti-flooding devices for the 3,500 places where flood waters can enter the subway system. At the Coney Island Yard, where six subway lines converge, the MTA is installing a 12,000-foot-long steel perimeter wall that construction workers have driven 30 feet into the ground. The work there should be completed within three years. Two other vulnerable subway yards are still undergoing repairs, too.\n\nAll of which prompted a reporter to ask if the MTA is prepared, right now, for another storm like Sandy.\n\n\u201cThe answer is 'much better prepared,'\u201d Foye said.\n\nFoye, outgoing MTA Managing Director Ronnie Hakim and Sandy-era MTA Chairman and CEO Joe Lhota \u2014 who was credited with helping quickly resurrect the system \u2014 spoke from beneath a blue pop-up tent in the drizzle. Work trains passed slowly behind them.\n\n\u201cWe learned valuable lessons from Sandy, and one of the most sobering lessons was that severe weather is no longer an anomaly, and the effects of climate change have only worsened,\u201d Foye said.\n\nThe Coney Island Yard sits in low-lying southern Brooklyn, close to Coney Island Creek. Sandy sent 27 million gallons of water and debris rushing into it, damaging 18 subway cars, more than 22 miles of power and communications cable, more than 39,000 feet of track, more than 300 signal locations and nearly 200 switches.\n\nWork to permanently protect the rail yard began last year, as part of the MTA's $7.7 billion hurricane recovery and resiliency plan. The MTA has thus far spent down about half of that $7.7 billion, according to spokesperson Abbey Collins.\n\n\u201cWe are using available funds responsibly,\u201d she said.\n\nAbout a year ago, Columbia University scientist Klaus Jacob took part in an analysis of the MTA\u2019s resiliency plans, with a particular focus on the subways.\n\nAfter analyzing the MTA\u2019s various methods for temporarily blocking the holes where floods might rush in, Jacob and his team determined the MTA was \u201cin pretty good shape for a couple of decades,\u201d he said in an interview on Tuesday. His team had one major caveat.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that we pointed out to the MTA is that it\u2019s a one-line defense, so if there are any failures in the system, in particular in key locations ... then you probably have a situation as if the other several thousand protective devices wouldn\u2019t be there,\u201d he said. \u201cOur question to the MTA was largely one of redundancy.\u201d", "description": "Subway executives gathered Tuesday to highlight all they've done to mitigate against future disasters \u2014 but they acknowledged it's a work in progress.", "authors": ["Dana Rubinstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c5/a0/b6e524db46f38dbb592e26741b8e/ap-17300735016275-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
