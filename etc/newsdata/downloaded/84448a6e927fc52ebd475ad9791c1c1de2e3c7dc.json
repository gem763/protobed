It is Clinuvel\u2019s only approved treatment and brought in A$25.8 million ($17.4 million) in 2018.\n\nThe disorder, which affects one in 75,000 to 200,000 worldwide and has no approved treatment in the United States, can force patients to cover up their exposed skin and in some cases avoid daytime altogether.\n\nScenesse has been shown to help patients stay outdoors longer without experiencing painful reactions to the sunlight.\n\nThe disease results from a genetic mutation that causes accumulation of a chemical compound called protoporphyrin in the blood and the skin, making them sensitive to light.", "description": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Australian drugmaker Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals Ltd's treatment for a rare inherited disorder that causes skin damage from exposure to light, sending its shares to a record high on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
