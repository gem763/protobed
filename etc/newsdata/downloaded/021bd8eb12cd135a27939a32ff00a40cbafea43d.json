India has rich ecological history with presence of dinosaurs. In Gandhinagar (one of the biggest site for dinosaur fossils) & Sirmaur in HP we have fossil parks about them. In Kolkata museum we have dinasaur skeletons. \u2014 Parveen Kaswan, IFS (@ParveenKaswan) October 22, 2019\n\nHowever the most interesting piece of trivia the IFS enlightened Twitterati with, is about a dinosaur that is named after the poet, writer and First Nobel prize winner of India - Rabindranath Tagore.\n\nDo you know #Rabindranath Tagore has a dinosaur named after him.\n\nBarapasaurus #tagorei was a 18 metre long & 7 tonned #dinosaur which walked through #India once. It was the first complete mounted dinosaur skeleton discovered in 1960s in Adilabad district of #India. \u2014 Parveen Kaswan, IFS (@ParveenKaswan) October 22, 2019\n\nDon't Miss 28 K SHARES 11.9 K SHARES 6.9 K SHARES 3.7 K SHARES 9.1 K SHARES\n\nHe tweeted, \u2018Barapasaurus #tagorei was a 18 metre long & 7 tonned #dinosaur which walked through #India once. It was the first complete mounted dinosaur skeleton discovered in 1960s in Adilabad district of #India\u2019.\n\nRabindranath Tagore still has a lot of impact on Indian literature and music, he is considered the predecessor of Bengali Renaissance and Indian Modernism, and Rabindra Sangeet is his legacy. It is another honour on his list of many, for one of the oldest creatures to have ever existed on earth, to be named after him.\n\nThe species tagorei Barapasaurus was located in the lower part of Kota Formation and it is one of the most completely known sauropods.\n\nDmitri Bogdanov\n\nTalking about etymology, Bara in a lot of Indian languages means \u2018big\u2019, pa means \u2018leg\u2019 even in Bengali and saurus as we know means \u2018lizard\u2019. So Barapasaurus is the \u2018big-legged lizard\u2019.\n\nThe first year of field work on the fossil was carried out in the centenary year of Tagore\u2019s birth.\n\nTagore became the first non-European to win a Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. He declined Knighthood that British offered him, after the Jallianwalla Bagh incident. He wrote the national anthem for our country and even Bangladesh. Even the Sri Lankan national anthem is known to be inspired by his work.", "description": "\u2018India has rich ecological history with presence of dinosaurs\u2019, IFS Parveen Kaswan tweeted sometime ago and it has revived our interest in the history of dinosaurs in India.
