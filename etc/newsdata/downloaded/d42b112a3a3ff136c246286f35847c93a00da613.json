Under his plan, L\u00f3pez Obrador said, there will be seven runways serving the metropolitan area: the two existing ones at Benito Juarez, three at Felipe Angeles and two at Toluca, compared with four under the Texcoco plan.\n\n\u201cWe are going to solve the problem for the long term,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said, \u201cfor 80 years going forward according to the specialists.\u201d\n\nThe president has been criticized by some for canceling Texcoco, whose partially built crisscross foundations can be seen by passengers landing at and taking off from Benito Juarez. And local groups argue that Santa Lucia has environmental risks and was pushed through without consulting indigenous people.\n\n\u201cWe still have time to protect the rights, traditions, way of life \u2026 of those peoples upon whom this country was built,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Antonio Lara Duque, president of the Zeferino Ladrillero Human Rights Center, said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\u201cOtherwise you condemn us to the destruction our relationship with Mother Earth and that is what has other people destroying the planet,\u201d Lara Duque added. \u201cLet us not do that, Mr. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador.\u201d\n\nThe groundbreaking took place a day after a court cleared the last of over 100 appeals that had delayed the onset of the project - something the president likened to \u201clegal sabotage.\u201d\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has argued that the project, begun under the administration of his predecessor, was susceptible to corruption. He also called the Texcoco option unsuitable for its location atop a sinking lakebed prone to soil subsidence.\n\n\u201cThis decision was better because this is better soil for construction where we are,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said. \u201cOver there (Texcoco) it\u2019s a lake, there is no solid ground. Just 30, 40, 50 meters below the surface it\u2019s a lake, it\u2019s mud, it\u2019s an area of constant sinking.\u201d\n\nKnown for both a personal ascetic lifestyle and imposing austerity on government agencies as president, L\u00f3pez Obrador also criticized the scope of the Texcoco project and said the Santa Lucia option will save $6.2 billion by comparison.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be doing pharaonic projects,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen there are so many needs in our country.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mexico broke ground Thursday on a project to supplement the capital's overtaxed international airport, finally making headway on a controversial alternative to another, equally controversial one that was scrapped last year after being about a third built.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Peter Orsi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/mexico_new_airport_61445_c0-160-5541-3392_s1200x700.jpg?b7553dd1116aa37ffb5ba79d835e1100a2452b2c", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
