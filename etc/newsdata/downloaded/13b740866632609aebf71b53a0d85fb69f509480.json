REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha\n\nCrowds later gathered in their thousands to the east in the shopping district of Causeway Bay and were heading towards the Central business district, the scene of mob street violence last weekend.\n\nThe Chinese-ruled territory has been rocked by weeks of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests, with demonstrators angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city\u2019s affairs despite a promise of autonomy.\n\nThe Sino-British Joint Declaration, signed in 1984, lays out Hong Kong\u2019s future after its return to China in 1997, a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that ensures freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\n\u201cSino-British Joint Declaration is VOID,\u201d one placard read. \u201cSOS Hong Kong,\u201d read another.\n\n\u201cOne country, two systems is dead,\u201d they shouted in English under the sub-tropical sun, some carrying the colonial flag also bearing the Union Jack. \u201cFree Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nSome broke into a refrain of \u201cRule Britannia\u201d.\n\nThe protesters handed in a petition and drifted away. Thousands were gathering in Causeway Bay and heading towards Central along the artery of Hennessy Road where the tram tracks lie.\n\nSHUTTERS CLOSE JUST IN CASE\n\nMajor shops in Central and Causeway Bay closed their shutters in case violence breaks out like on previous weekends when protesters trashed metro stations and set street fires, with the police responding with tear gas, rubber bullets and water canon.\n\n\u201cEven though the march is officially cancelled that is not a problem. If they won\u2019t stand up, we still will,\u201d a 27-year-old protester said.\n\nMany protesters at the British Consulate held flyers calling for \u201cequal rights\u201d for their British National (Overseas) passports.\n\nWith many young people looking for routes out of Hong Kong, campaigners say Britain should change the status of the British National (Overseas) passport, a category created, on certain conditions, after Britain returned Hong Kong to China.\n\nThe passports allow a holder to visit Britain for six months, but do not come with an automatic right to live or work there.\n\n\u201cI am here to demand the UK protect our citizens\u2019 rights in Hong Kong and speak up for Hong Kong under the Joint Declaration,\u201d Jacky Tsang, 25, told Reuters.\n\nThe spark for the protests was planned legislation, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, despite Hong Kong having its own much-respected independent judiciary.\n\nThe protests have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.\n\n\u2018LEGALLY BINDING\u2019\n\nChina says it is committed to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement, denies meddling and says the city is an internal Chinese issue. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest and told them to mind their own business.\n\nBritain says it has a legal responsibility to ensure China abides by the 1984 declaration.\n\nHong Kong island was granted to Britain \u201cin perpetuity\u201d in 1842 at the end of the First Opium War. Kowloon, a peninsula on the mainland opposite Hong Kong island, joined later, after the Second Opium War.\n\nThe colony was expanded to include the New Territories, to the north of Kowloon, on a 99-year lease, in 1898.\n\nBritain returned all of the territory to China, which never recognised the \u201cunequal treaties\u201d, in 1997.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\n\u201cThe Joint Declaration is a legally binding treaty between the UK and China that remains as valid today as it was when it was signed and ratified over 30 years ago,\u201d a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said in June.\n\n\u201cAs a co-signatory, the UK government will continue to defend our position.\u201d\n\nBut it was not immediately clear what Britain could or would want to do to defend that position. It is pinning its hopes on closer trade and investment cooperation with China, which since 1997 has risen to become the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after it leaves the European Union at the end of next month.", "description": "Hundreds of Hong Kong protesters singing \"God Save the Queen\" and waving Union Jack flags rallied outside the British Consulate on Sunday demanding that the former colonial power ensures China honours its commitments to the city's freedoms.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Farah Master", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430020345&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E032", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
