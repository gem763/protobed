As Trysta Krick details, they do have one saving grace. USA TODAY\n\nSome notable \u2014 and not-so notable \u2014 accomplishments and performances from Week 6 of the 2019 NFL season, by the numbers:\n\n5: The Pittsburgh Steelers' Devlin Hodges became the fifth undrafted rookie quarterback to win his first start in the last 15 years. Matt Moore, Max Hall, Matt McGloin and Kyle Allen were the others.\n\n12-1: The New York Jets wrecked a lot of survivor pool hopes with their stunning 24-22 win over the Dallas Cowboys. The Jets also put a blemish on the Cowboys' record when Ezekiel Elliott has 150 or more yards from scrimmage. Dallas was 12-0 in such games until Sunday.\n\n11: With three interceptions thrown in the Cleveland Browns' loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Baker Mayfield has now thrown 11 INTs through six games, the most for a Browns quarterback through the first six games since Paul McDonald had 12 picks in the first six games of the 1984 season.\n\n30-95-1: After Sunday's loss to the Seahawks at FirstEnergy Stadium, the Browns fell to 2-4 on the season and 30-95-1 (a whopping .242 winning percentage) since the release of the \"Factory of Sadness\" video on Nov. 6, 2011 following a 30-12 loss to the Houston Texans (h/t @JaceTEvans).\n\n1990: With Sunday's statement win over the Los Angeles Rams, the San Francisco 49ers are 5-0 for the first time since 1990, when the team opened 10-0 and went on to lose the NFC title game to the New York Giants, who then went on to win Super Bowl XXV in epic fashion. The 49ers also opened 6-0 en route to finishing 15-1 and winning Super Bowl XIX during the 1984 season.\n\nWEEK 6: 32 things we learned\n\n'HUMBLING DAY': Rams aren't in crisis yet but know they need to rebound\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER: Sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox\n\nJimmy Garoppolo celebrates after Sunday's win over the Rams. (Photo: Orlando Ramirez, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n13-2: 49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo made his 15th career NFL start Sunday, and by improving to 13-2 as a starter he became the eighth quarterback in the Super Bowl era to win 13 of his first 15 career starts.\n\n7 sacks, 5 INTs: The Carolina Panthers had seven sacks and five interceptions in the win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in London. Carolina is the first team with at least seven sacks and five interceptions in a game since the Miami Dolphins had eight sacks and six interceptions of poor Donald Hollas in a win over the Oakland Raiders on Dec. 6, 1998. Buccaneers QB Jameis Winston has five games of at least four turnovers since entering the NFL in 2015. No other player has more than two in that span. That's not ideal, Bucs fans.\n\n7,508: With 280 yards passing in the Houston Texans' win over the Kansas City Chiefs, Deshaun Watson now has 7,508 passing yards through 29 career games, tying Marc Bulger, Dan Marino and Matthew Stafford as quarterbacks to reach 7,500 career passing yards in the second-fewest games. Kurt Warner reached 7,500 career passing yards in 27 games.\n\n17: There were 17 punts in the Denver Broncos' not-exactly scintillating 16-0 win over the Tennessee Titans. It was a brutal day for the Titans, who benched Marcus Mariota in favor of Ryan Tannehill.\n\n69: There are 69 short days until the lone remaining winless teams, the Cincinnati Bengals and Miami Dolphins, face off in a Week 16 showdown that could decide which team gets the No. 1 overall selection in the 2020 NFL draft.
