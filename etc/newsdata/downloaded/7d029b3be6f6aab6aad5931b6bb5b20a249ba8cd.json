The other major indexes ended the day with meaningless moves as well, and breadth was just barely positive. In other words, nothing much happened.\n\nThere was a gap-down at the open that was bought and then some buying interest in the middle of the day, but late selling wiped out the gains.\n\nWithout more volatility, it is a very difficult market to trade. The main problem seems to be that there is enough negativity to prevent negative surprises, but no confidence in the market's ability to produce sustained strength. The risk of a \"good\" news headline is probably greater than the risk of a \"bad\" news headline, but this market has not been able to generate momentum on any of the major news events lately.\n\nIt may take some more severe downside action before we can see good upside strength. There are too many people who are confident about buying even minor weakness and they are preventing the downside from developing. They need to lose some of that confidence and be shaken out before better buyers will step up.\n\nI don't know how this action is going to eventually resolve itself, but the market is doing a remarkable good job of annoying everyone -- which is its main goal most of the time.\n\nBuyers want to buy weakness and sellers want to sell strength, and the net result is that we are going nowhere right now.\n\nHave a good evening. I'll see you Tuesday.", "description": "Those looking to add stocks are waiting for weakness and those aiming to shed shares want to do so on strength -- the net result is that we are going no where right now....SPY", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Market Continues To Annoy Sellers", "Buyers Alike", "Those Looking To Add Stocks Are Waiting For Weakness", "Those Aiming To Shed Shares Want To Do So On Strength -- The Net Result Is That We Are Going Nowhere Right Now.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "Bruce Kamich", "Stephen Guilfoyle"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/bc4dd04c-cded-11e9-848d-d3878ca814a3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
