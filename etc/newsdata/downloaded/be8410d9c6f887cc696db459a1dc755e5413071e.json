And her numerous green articles of clothing.\n\nThe pop star served as musical guest for the second episode of the season, which meant she got to play two songs.\n\nFirst up: \"Lover.\" After she had a much flashier rendition of the title track of her new album at the VMAs, Swift sat solo at the piano for the song on Saturday. The singer was decked out in a green turtleneck, green pants, green earrings, green nail polish and at a green piano with a green floor and green walls to look like a scene out of her kaleidoscopic \"Lover\" music video. Sheet music appeared as if it were frozen midair while Swift tickled the ivories and sang her romantic tune, smiling while cooing lines like \"I take this magnetic force to be mine, lover.\"\n\nShe ended the song with a huge grin and a little, celebratory shimmy from her (green) piano bench.\n\nSong No. 2: \"False God.\" Swift's live debut of the song was vibey, with a saxophonist, drummer and background singers. Swift and her voice were front and center, though, as she sang and snaked her mic-free arm while wearing black sequined pants and an oversized black blazer. All around her, bare lightbulbs shone and smoke rose from the floor.\n\nThe stripped-down songs had Twitter buzzing: The hashtag #TaylorOnSNL continued to trend even after \"SNL\" ended.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/06/taylor-swift-snl-lover-false-god/3889769002/", "description": "As musical guest on \"SNL,\" Taylor Swift played \"Lover\" on piano and sang with a sax player for \"False God.\"", "authors": ["Carly Mallenbaum", "Published A.M.
