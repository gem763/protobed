REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nWith a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit considered by markets to be off the table, some estimates of the scale of that portfolio rebalancing run to as high as a quarter of trillion pounds.\n\nMarkets wobbled after the UK parliament refused to approve Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal timetable, but a Brexit extension and even an election should not meaningfully change the equation for UK assets amid hopes 3-1/2 years of political uncertainty is ending - at least for now.\n\nSunil Krishnan, head of multi-asset funds at Aviva Investors, said UK assets had been viewed as being in a \u201ctoo-difficult box\u201d, meaning they were either shunned or \u201cshorted\u201d \u2014sold with the aim of buying back at a lower price.\n\nNow some of those short positions are being covered, he said.\n\n\u201cThe skew of risks is marginally now towards the upside and that\u2019s an upside we haven\u2019t seen for a year,\u201d Krishnan said, adding that some of Aviva\u2019s absolute return funds had recently taken on sterling exposure versus the dollar.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of professional investors who haven\u2019t covered their positions and won\u2019t do that before we get 100% clarity on the Brexit outcome,\u201d Krishnan said.\n\nHEAVILY GEARED\n\nOverseas investors have especially avoided shares in sectors such as homebuilders and retailers that are heavily geared to the UK economy, but these have rallied around 5% since an Oct. 10 Brexit breakthrough and many analysts reckon they have further to go.\n\nSimilarly, the pound weakened almost 20% between the referendum and early October.\n\nGraphic: UK mid-cap stocks hit highest in a year - here\n\nOf late though, short pound positions have slipped to $5.8 billion, off this year\u2019s high of $7.8 billion, according to the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission, which is estimated to capture around 10% of outstanding market positions.\n\nGraphic: In for a short squeeze? - here\n\nBut there is a lot more out there than speculative bets.\n\nA Morgan Stanley report estimates that if companies and asset managers unwind even a fraction of the currency hedges they had put in place to protect against pound weakness, sterling demand could spike to around \u00a3300 billion by year end.\n\nForeigners will have FX-hedged at least part of the \u00a33.4 trillion they hold in British securities and some of this could be unwound, the bank calculated.\n\nOn the other hand, UK funds holding foreign assets might also need to buy sterling on a forward basis to offset the impact a firmer pound has on overseas investments.\n\nWhile hedge ratios don\u2019t usually change quickly, a Brexit deal \u201cmay bring urgency to this process,\u201d Morgan Stanley told clients, advising buying sterling against the dollar.\n\nNOT MUCH DOWNSIDE\n\nDean Turner, UK economist at UBS Wealth Management, also doesn\u2019t see too much downside for the pound even if an election is called and the withdrawal bill is pulled.\n\nThat\u2019s because an election will see the UK either exit the EU under the terms of Johnson\u2019s deal or hold a second referendum that could cancel Brexit altogether.\n\nAn orderly Oct. 31 Brexit would have lifted sterling to $1.35, but a delay will only push it to \u201cmid-$1.20s to $1.32\u201d, Turner added. It trades at $1.2850 GBP=D3.\n\nGraphic: Sterling still cheap - here\n\nYet any euphoria may not last beyond a few months, given the reality of navigating life outside the EU will soon set in especially against a backdrop of trade wars and slowing world growth.\n\nFocus will also likely turn to future trade ties with the EU once the transition period expires in Dec. 2020.\n\nBut for the time being investors seem ready to bet that the worst of the turmoil in the world\u2019s No.5 economy is drawing to a close.\n\nGraphic: UK stock market valuations cheap versus peers - here\n\nUK-exposed shares are under-owned in portfolios and undervalued relative to peers - allocations to UK equities hit record lows of 7.46% last month, according to Copley Fund Research, which tracks more than 400 funds managing $800 billion in assets.\n\nBefore the referendum, allocations were around 9.2%.\n\nCompare also the amount of shares in the FTSE 250 .FTMC that are out on loan, probably for shorting purposes - IHS Markit calculates the short loan value for the FTSE 250 at 1.63%, double the level for the FTSE 100 .FTSE, an index with more exporters and international firms.\n\nThat\u2019s down however from highs around 2%, hit in early-2019 when no-deal Brexit looked plausible.\n\nGraphic: Short positions on UK stocks fall as Brexit nears - here\n\nA 5% rise in the FTSE 250 is likely once the path and timing of Brexit is clarified, analysts canvassed by Reuters broadly expect, especially given earnings expectations for domestic firms have recovered from a near-decade lows earlier this year.\n\nBarclays advised clients to increase exposure to domestic companies, predicting they would benefit disproportionately. It also last week closed its long-held preference for UK-listed exporters.\n\nGraphic: FTSE 250 versus FTSE 100 earnings - here", "description": "Even though Brexit is set for another delay beyond this month, investors still appear confident enough to start unwinding tens of billions of pounds worth of bearish bets against the pound and domestically-focused UK stocks.", "authors": ["Sujata Rao", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444180776&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1EX", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
