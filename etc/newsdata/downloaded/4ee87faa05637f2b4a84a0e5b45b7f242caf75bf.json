It's the engagement: Bindi Irwin 'has been planning this' since age 7, her mom says", "language": "en", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 Bindi Irwin is a hugger. She hugs everyone.\n\nBut when the daughter of late wildlife expert Steve Irwin first met professional wake boarder Chandler Powell at Australia Zoo, she gave him a handshake.\n\nShe was so overwhelmed, she couldn't bring herself to hug him. \"I was so nervous; he was so gorgeous,\" she tells USA TODAY.\n\nMore than half a decade later, she and Chandler are engaged to be married. The engagement was filmed for the second season of Animal Planet's \"Crikey! It's the Irwins,\" premiering Saturday (8 EDT/PDT), which continues Steve Irwin's mission to bring people and animals closer together.\n\nTo propose, Chandler enlisted the help of Bindi's mother, Terri, and her brother, Robert.\n\nNow that Chandler and Bindi work at the zoo together, pulling off a surprise proposal required coordination.\n\nHe told Bindi he was planning a birthday photo shoot for her 21st. It served as a good reason to shed their typical khaki garb.\n\n\"Terri took Bindi to get her nails done and have a day away from the zoo, so Robert and I could scout out the perfect location,\" Chandler says.\n\n\"Very sneaky,\" says Robert, who photographed the engagement from the bushes.\n\nThey found the perfect spot for Robert to hide, and he laid out sticks in the grass where Chandler would propose.\n\nThe next day, he suggested a walk through the zoo and popped the question.\n\nShe said yes immediately and began crying before Robert jumped out of the bushes and terrified her, she recalls, laughing.\n\nBindi, whose family compares her to Amy Poehler's super-organized Leslie Knope of \"Parks and Recreation,\" has nearly all of the wedding details hammered out.\n\n\"If you want to know the real truth, she has been planning this since she was about 7,\" Terri says.\n\nThe wedding is planned for next year at Australia Zoo in Beerwah, where the couple will be surrounded by friends and family, Bindi says. Robert will walk Bindi down the aisle.\n\n\"Everything comes so easily,\" she says. \"It's my backyard; it's my home.\"\n\nThe wedding will certainly be a wild (animal) one. Bindi and Chandler are thinking about having a \"first croc feed\" as a married couple, he says.\n\n\"You are now husband and wife; you may feed the crocodiles,\" Terri jokes.\n\nBindi says it would be fun to have everyone walk down the aisle with koalas. Although the bride will wear white, there will definitely be touches of khaki.\n\nBindi found her dress in New York City. As soon as she tried it on, she and Terri were in tears. The dress is a tribute to Terri's; she married Steve in what Bindi calls \"the most gorgeous lace gown.\" Since she was a little girl, she knew she wanted to wear something similar.\n\nThe bride-to-be posted a photo on Instagram that was a nod to Animal Planet's sibling channel TLC: \"I said yes to the dress.\"\n\nThe couple just need to pick a date. It shouldn't be too difficult to reserve the venue. \"Hopefully your wedding is on season three,\" Robert says.\n\n\"Crikey! It's the wedding,\" Chandler chuckles.\n\n'Crikey!':Steve Irwin's family starts 'beautiful new chapter' with Animal Planet show\n\nBindi Irwin:Compares dad Steve Irwin's death to 'losing a part of your heart'\n\nIn addition to the engagement, the second season is filled with daring missions, koala romance, animal rescues and releases and preparations leading up to the 50th anniversary of Australia Zoo.", "description": "See Chandler Powell propose to Bindi Irwin in Season 2 of \"Crikey!
