You\u2019ll die bro. I promise you. I promise you!\u201d\n\nThe skinny man is then seen carrying what appears to be a metal bar in his hand as the man in the shirt continues to stand up to his assailant.\n\nHis face has been covered in his own blood, but continued to walk towards them, until the gang left.\n\nThe video has been viewed over 100,000 times with the beaten man winning the adulation of the commenters.\n\nTony Maughan said: \u201cSeen cowards, but never so many together bouncing on their toes giving it the bigness as though [they are] boxers, big lad hardly moved when they hit him, only one winner there.\u201d\n\nKelvin Roberts wrote: \u201cRespect to the big guy\u2026 took so much and kept his cool\u2026 would have been a different story if he had a one on one.\u201d\n\nJc Osborne said: \u201cBunch of absolute f***ies, that guy took everything they had and still walked them off the pub grounds.\u201d\n\nJosh Renshaw added: \u201cHe took all the shots like a boss until that cheap shot from behind. Fair play to him, as for the others, [they are] a set of wet wipes.\u201d\n\nDean Humphries wrote: \u201cPack of dogs jumping in, big guy stood his ground and acted inside the law.\u201d\n\nWest Midlands Police said the incident had not been reported to them.", "description": "Footage of the violent incident shows the victim being repeatedly punched in the face and thrown to the ground outside a Birmingham pub as screaming staff try to break the group up", "authors": ["Cameron Ward"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645884.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-MAN_ASSAULTED_BY_THUGS_OUTSIDE_PUB_DN01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
