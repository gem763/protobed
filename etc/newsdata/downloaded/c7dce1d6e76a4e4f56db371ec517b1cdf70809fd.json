China is instead building its own permanent station and has invited other countries to join in the effort.\n\nChina last year launched more missions to orbit than any other country, and is on track to do the same this year. Those missions include the first-ever soft-landing of a space craft on the far side of the moon.\n\nThe visa incident came amid a simmering trade war between China and the U.S. that includes accusations that China steals or coerces foreign firms to hand over sensitive technology.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
