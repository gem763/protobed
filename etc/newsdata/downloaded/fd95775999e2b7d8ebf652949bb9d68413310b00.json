Matt Farwell\n\nTaking a blacked-out flight to this particular black site is a tradition as old as the facility itself, and one grounded in tragedy. The idea was brilliant: Put a secret testing ground inside of a secret testing ground, fly in the best scientists, pilots and engineers, and swear them to secrecy. But early on, in 1955, an Air Force C-54 carrying 14 souls through a blizzard crashed near the summit of Mount Charleston, 50 miles west of the Las Vegas strip. Publicly, it was a flight of businessmen, but the crew were technicians sent to work on the design of the then-new U-2 spy plane. The flight\u2019s strict secrecy, including radio silence, may have contributed to the crash, which killed all onboard. \u201cSo secret was the crew and passengers\u2019 involvement in the U-2 project,\u201d reads a plaque honoring the Silent Heroes of the Cold War near the crash site, \u201cthat the families were not told of the mission or deaths for over four decades.\u201d\n\n\n\nI\u2019d already told my family where I was going, and flying wasn\u2019t an option: Doug, Marie Claire and I would drive 150 miles through the desolation of December desert, tiny patches of thin white snow popping against the flat dun. By the time we were a half-hour north of Las Vegas, we hardly saw another car. Later on, we stopped at E-T Fresh Jerky\u2014open daily\u2014to use the restroom, check out the kitsch and buy supplies, and I had a new appreciation for how remote and inhospitable, not to mention de-populated, the area around Area 51 really is.\n\nAfter World War II, a government study called \u201cProject Nutmeg\u201d was responsible for selecting another continental atomic testing ground. Sites in Alaska, Canada, coastal North Carolina, Texas, Utah, and New Mexico were all considered before the government finally settled on \u201cthe area between Las Vegas and Tonopah, Nevada, somewhere on the Las Vegas Bombing and Gunnery Range,\u201d according to an official Department of Energy history released on the project\u2019s 50th anniversary in 2000. America\u2019s atomic tests moved in 1951 from the Trinity site in New Mexico to approximately \u201c1,375 square miles of remote desert and mountain terrain owned and controlled by the Department of Energy\u201d north of Las Vegas, a barren desert where kit foxes, sidewinder rattlesnakes, mule deer, striped whip snakes, coyotes, golden eagles, mountain lions and even the \u201coccasional bighorn sheep and antelope\u201d roam. \u201cFew areas of the continental United States are more ruggedly severe and inhospitable to humans,\u201d the DOE history notes; in the desert between Las Vegas and Tonopah, \u201cwater\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014is the dominating climactic characteristic.\u201d\n\nHere, between 1951 and 1992\u2014when President George H.W. Bush signed congressional legislation mandating a moratorium on U.S. nuclear weapons tests\u2014the American government (and, occasionally, the British) would detonate 1,021 nuclear devices. It started with a \u201cshot\u201d code-named \u201cAble\u201d on January 27, 1951\u2014the first of 100 above-ground nuclear explosions in Nevada, which quickly became tourist attractions, according to the Atomic Heritage Foundation:\n\nMushroom clouds from the atmospheric tests could be seen up to 100 miles away in the distance. This led to increased tourism for Las Vegas, and throughout the 1950s and early 1960s the city capitalized on this interest. Many guests could see clouds, or bursts of light from hotel windows, and the hotels promoted these sights. Some casinos also hosted \u201cdawn parties\u201d and created atomic themed cocktails, encouraging visitors to view the tests. Calendars throughout the city also advertised detonation times, as well as the best viewing spots to see flashes or lights or mushroom clouds.\n\nUnder the cover that radioactive detonations provided, the CIA operated an air strip, \u201c5000 feet by 100 feet,\u201d carved out of the Atomic Energy Commission test facility near Groom Lake and called \u201cWatertown,\u201d in a nod to the hellish upstate New York hometown of the Dulles brothers\u2014Allen, then the CIA director, and John Foster, the secretary of state. This airfield, where that ill-fated C-54 had been headed, was used to develop the U-2 spy plane in the early 1950s. In 1961, under Operation Nougat, nuclear tests moved underground. By this time, the CIA was already working on its next secret aircraft, Project Oxcart, which the Air Force would adapt as the SR-71 supersonic spy jet. According to the CIA\u2019s declassified project history, the really impressive thing about Oxcart\u2014despite the fact that it could fly higher and faster than any other airplane in the world\u2014was that \u201cIts development had been carried out in profound secrecy\u201d:", "description": "As the secret base gets \"stormed,\" a veteran of war and conspiracy reporting reflects on the Nevada desert's dirtiest un-secrets.", "authors": ["Matt Farwell"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/e9cedf792c1d7ab24a77c9af21a67ba4748540f3.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
