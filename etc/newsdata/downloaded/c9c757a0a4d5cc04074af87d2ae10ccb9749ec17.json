Now, records show how far beyond Silicon Valley the practice extends \u2014 encompassing scores of banks, credit agencies, cellphone carriers and even universities.\n\nThe demands can scoop up a variety of information, including usernames, locations, IP addresses and records of purchases. They don\u2019t require a judge\u2019s approval and usually come with a gag order, leaving them shrouded in secrecy. Fewer than 20 entities, most of them tech companies, have ever revealed that they\u2019ve received the subpoenas, known as national security letters\u2026\n\nThe credit agencies Equifax, Experian and TransUnion received a large number of the letters in the filing. So did financial institutions like Bank of America, Western Union and even the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. All declined to explain how they handle the letters. An array of other entities received smaller numbers of requests \u2014 including Kansas State University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, probably because of their role in providing internet service.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Data-Privacy-Fbi.Html"], "top_image": ""}
