This is the tripe that comes from the mouths of spoiled little social parasites who harbor a fear of being forced into working real jobs, having to earn their own money and think their own thoughts.\n\nFor those Americans who do not have the luxury of sitting idly by while fabricating absurd buzz words and phrases, the 2020 elections are not about anything more or less than putting a halt to the Stalinist stupidity that has caused so much pain in America. Those of us who do not care who takes a knee or which sneaker company supports the socialist agenda (because we\u2019re working too hard supporting the national GDP), are relieved to discover that what we have is a list of people and companies who will never enjoy the fruits of our labor.\n\nWe refuse to watch a football game wherein a mediocre player kneels during the National Anthem, or to purchase footwear from a company who seems to have forgotten that it is those like us, who work, who have the money to buy their junk. I will buy my coffee from patriots who have faced the darkness on my behalf and lived to come home. I will buy my clothing and pillows from Americans who understand real words such as \u201chonor\u201d and \u201csacrifice\u201d and who know the value of something that is \u201cMade in America.\u201d\n\nTo me, the word \u201cwokeness\u201d is leftist spittle for believing your own press and having a sense of worth derived from the fantasy world of the morally bankrupt. Even if it were a real word, it would represent nothing because it is the construct of psychosis born of delusion.\n\nJEFFREY H.
