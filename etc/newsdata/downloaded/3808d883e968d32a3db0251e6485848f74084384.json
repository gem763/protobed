No, the Redskins briefly held a 7-0 lead early in the second quarter, scoring on the formerly banished Adrian Peterson\u2019s one-yard run.\n\nThat disappeared eight minutes later when Dallas (2-0) quarterback Dak Prescott went at the Spanish bullfighter, Josh Norman, and hit Devin Smith with a 51-yard touchdown pass to tie the game 7-7. Six minutes later, Prescott found unretired tight end Jason Witten on a 2-yarder to give the Cowboys a 14-7 lead, a lead they continued to build on.\n\nBut here are the similarities \u2014 32 points last week, 31 points Sunday, 436 yards given up last week, 474 yards Sunday. This from a defense that was touted by, among others, Norman, before the start of the season, as \u201cthe best\u201d defense since he arrived four years ago, one that could wind up being \u201call time.\u201d\n\nTime may be running out, though, for this defensive coaching staff \u2014 particularly beleaguered coordinator Greg Manusky.\n\nThere is the legendary story about owner Dan Snyder, in his first year in 1999, leaving gallons of 31 Flavors ice cream on Redskins defensive coordinator Mike Nolan\u2019s desk with a note that said, \u201cThis is what I like. Not vanilla.\u201d\n\nManusky may find a different food group on his desk at Redskins Park this week \u2014 Swiss cheese. Perhaps that was the smell coming from the field Sunday \u2014 a moldy, Swiss-cheese defense that has failed to show any ability to connect the talent with results on the field. Remember, they spent all off-season interviewing defensive coordinator candidates in an unsuccessful effort to replace Manusky.\n\nCoach Jay Gruden was under attack in the postgame press conference for his defensive coaching staff. Asked about making changes, he responded, \u201cYou\u2019re talking about playing two very good offensive football teams and two of the best offensive lines in pro football we just played back to back. That\u2019s no excuse whatsoever, but I don\u2019t think we need to hit the panic button yet. We just have to continue to focus on what we can do better to win.\u201d\n\nHe cited the absence of injured defensive players, such as tackle Jonathan Allen and cornerbacks Quinton Dunbar and Fabian Moreau. But even when healthy, the same inconsistent defensive lapses have continued one season into the next since Manusky was named coordinator in January 2017.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this together,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time with Coach Manusky already this week and we\u2019re going to work through this thing.\u201d\n\nIt was the presence, though, for the second week in a row of one particular defensive player \u2014 the highly-paid cornerback Josh Norman, world traveler who spent the off-season running with the bulls in Pamplona \u2014 that has caused much of the defensive damage. After getting lit up by DeSean Jackson last week, Norman found himself targeted again, with the same disappointing results.\n\nHe had something to say about that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not putting anybody under the bus,\u201d Norman said. \u201cI\u2019m not putting my teammates under. Overall, I take it on the chin. I have to hold my head high and keep going forward. I\u2019ve never been in this adverse state before. When adversity strikes, what do you do with it? Two times in two weeks this happened to our secondary and I take full responsibility for it. Who else is going to do it \u2026. we just have to be better in situations like that, and we will. The season is still young. I\u2019m not overall concerned. We got 14 more to go man \u2026 our time will come, and when it does, it will break the opponent\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nLast week, Norman seemed to run some tires over Prescott, who finished Sunday completing 26 of 30 passes for 269 yards and one interception. After Prescott completed 25 of 32 passes for 405 yards in a 35-17 win over the New York Giants, Noeman didn\u2019t seem too impressed, telling reporters: \u201cYou stand back there in the pocket all day and go through your first, second and third reads and come back to your first one, OK, cool. Anybody can do that. At the end of the day, he\u2019s been playing well. As you can see, he\u2019s evolved. He\u2019s growing in the system. He\u2019s just taking his keys and picking his targets and throwing the ball on time.\u201d\n\nIt turns out Norman was angrier Sunday about what he claims was a report taken out of context than his matador defense on the field.\n\n\u201cWhat was said earlier in the week about what I was saying about the quarterback, that the narrative of the media always take what they wanted and put whatever spin on it to try to get more clout than what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cI think when you look at that whole entire situation, what we say always gets taken out of context. Anybody can sit back in the pocket and do what they want when you have nobody pass rush. When you get people in your face it\u2019s a different story. I\u2019m not taking anything away from anybody, that\u2019s any quarterback, not just one person. To change that narrative, I\u2019m going to take control of it. He\u2019s a great football player, Dak always has been a great football player. They did a great job out here today, and they showed that.\n\n\u201cWhat I will not do is allow the media or whoever the case may be to change my words into what they want it to be,\u201d he said.\n\nSomewhere in Spain there is one happy bull.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesdays and Saturday and Sunday mornings.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
