Biden Jr.,\" wrote New York Times' Ken Vogel. | Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nEIGHT TIMES, via WSJ\u2019s Alan Cullison, Rebecca Ballhaus and Dustin Volz: \u201cPresident Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden \u2019s son, urging Volodymyr Zelensky about eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, on a probe, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201c\u2018He told him that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know\u2019 whether allegations were true or not, one of the people said. Mr. Trump didn\u2019t mention a provision of foreign aid to Ukraine on the call, said this person, who didn\u2019t believe Mr. Trump offered the Ukrainian president any quid-pro-quo for his cooperation on an investigation.\u201d WSJ\n\n-- NYT\u2019S KEN VOGEL: \u201cBehind the Whistle-Blower Case, a Long-Held Trump Grudge Toward Ukraine\u201d: \u201cFor months this spring and summer, Ukraine\u2019s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, tried to deflect pressure from President Trump and his allies to pursue investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Biden\u2019s son and other Trump rivals.\n\n\u201cThe pressure was so relentless that Mr. Zelensky dispatched one of his closest aides to open a line of communication with Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers. Mr. Giuliani was the loudest voice among those demanding that Ukraine look at Mr. Biden\u2019s dealings with the country when he was vice president at the same time his younger son, Hunter Biden, was doing business there.\n\n\u201cOver breakfast in early July at the Trump International Hotel, Mr. Zelensky\u2019s aide asked the State Department\u2019s envoy to Ukraine for help connecting to Mr. Giuliani. Several days later, the aide discussed with Mr. Giuliani by phone the prospective investigations as well as something the Ukrainians wanted: a White House meeting between Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cBut if Mr. Zelensky\u2019s goal was to reduce the pressure to pursue the investigations and win more support from the White House \u2014 not least for Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia \u2014 he would be disappointed.\u201d NYT\n\n-- WAPO\u2019S ASHLEY PARKER: \u201cUkraine, if you\u2019re listening . . .: How Trump tries to quell controversies by saying the quiet part out loud\u201d\n\nTHE BIDEN CONUNDRUM -- WAPO\u2019S MATT VISER: \u201cScrutiny over Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal may also complicate Biden\u2019s campaign\u201d: \u201cBiden faced two dueling realities: The president he is hoping to defeat next year \u2014 and who he describes as morally unfit for office \u2014 is under scrutiny for behavior some view as treasonous. But the story is inextricably linked to Biden\u2019s son, pushing one of the topics that Biden is least comfortable discussing into the spotlight.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of taking advantage of this political moment without becoming ensnared was evident by how Biden responded to the news Friday afternoon. First, he reacted defensively in an exchange with reporters in Iowa. Then later, in a formal statement from his campaign, he forcefully denounced Trump\u2019s actions.\u201d\n\nBIDEN\u2019S STATEMENT: \"If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump\u2019s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country. This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes.\n\n\u201cIt means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation\u2014a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia\u2014pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor.\u201d\n\nTO WIT \u2026 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP THIS A.M. -- (@realDonaldTrump) at 8:31 a.m.: \u201cThe Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won\u2019t get a very large amount of U.S. money, so they fabricate a.....\n\n\u201c....story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine. Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden\u2019s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. The Fake News knows this but doesn\u2019t want to report!\u201d\n\nGood Saturday morning.

On Thursday, the Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously approved a bipartisan spending package containing $250 million to help states safeguard voting systems. Among the co-sponsors was the majority leader, Mr. McConnell, who, in a floor speech before the committee\u2019s vote, declared himself \u2018proud\u2019 to support the measure.\n\n\u201cTo say this was a welcome surprise would be an understatement. Mr. McConnell has spent the past year-plus blocking multiple bipartisan proposals for election security. This despite warnings from the intelligence community and others that American elections remain vulnerable to outside interference. In his testimony before Congress on Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential race, Robert Mueller, the former special counsel, stressed that Russia was still \u2018doing it as we sit here\u2019 even as other foreign actors were poised to do the same.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Baldor and Robert Burns: \u201cThe Pentagon on Friday announced it will deploy additional U.S. troops and missile defense equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as President Donald Trump has at least for now put off any immediate military strike on Iran in response to the attack on the Saudi oil industry.\n\n\u201cDefense Secretary Mark Esper told Pentagon reporters this is a first step to beef up security and he would not rule out additional moves down the road. Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said more details about the deployment will be determined in the coming days, but it would not involve thousands of U.S. troops.\n\n\u201cOther officials said the U.S. deployment would likely be in the hundreds and the defensive equipment heading to the Middle East would probably include Patriot missile batteries and possibly enhanced radars.\u201d AP\n\nIT\u2019S OFFICIAL \u2026 KENNEDY JUMPS IN -- \u201cKennedy plays an unfamiliar role in Senate primary clash \u2014 insurgent,\u201d by Stephanie Murray and James Arkin in Boston: \u201cThe first days of Joe Kennedy\u2019s Senate primary campaign offer a glimpse at the coalition he hopes to assemble in his challenge to Sen. Ed Markey, a blockbuster contest that could reorder Massachusetts\u2019 congressional delegation.\n\n\u201cAfter launching with a breakfast Saturday in East Boston, where the Kennedy family traces back to a neighborhood populated by Irish immigrants in the mid- to late-1800s, he\u2019ll embark on a three-day statewide tour that begins Saturday. The roughly 15-stop trip is largely focused on immigration, affordable housing and the opioid crisis. He\u2019ll meet with LGBTQ asylum seekers and refugees in Worcester, and talk about climate change and union jobs in New Bedford. In Boston, he\u2019ll tour an affordable housing development.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strategy that focuses less on winning over activists and establishment leaders, and more on turning out new voters \u2014 particularly immigrants and people of color \u2014 who typically vote at lower rates than white voters do. It\u2019s a model that worked spectacularly here for Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley in her insurgent 2018 House campaign against another fixture of the state political establishment, then-Rep.

In fact, what was most notable about it was what it did not say.\u201d NYT\n\nVALLEY TALK -- \u201cFacebook CEO tries the quiet approach to soothing Washington,\u201d by Cristiano Lima and Nancy Scola: \u201cMark Zuckerberg\u2019s Washington tour this week represents a new approach to politics for him: low-key, closed-door but highly solicitous of the most important players in town. Facebook's CEO had previously addressed concerns about privacy and social media through acts of public contrition and limited engagement with Congress or the White House. Zuckerberg\u2019s last appearance in the nation's capital was a contentious congressional hearing in April 2018.\n\n\u201cThis time, the social media giant\u2019s founder \u2014 clad in a suit and tie, saying nothing to reporters \u2014 spent three days engaged in quiet diplomacy with members of Congress and President Donald Trump. That included a final day of private meetings on Friday, including with lawmakers pursuing antitrust investigations of the tech industry and others drafting legislation to restrict how websites use consumer data.\n\n\u201cThe personal touch seemed to resonate with some members, though others remained critical of the industry. While it wasn\u2019t quite clear what Zuckerberg accomplished on the host of questions Facebook faces on issues like user privacy, anti-competitive behavior, Russian election interference and the company\u2019s plans for a cryptocurrency, the mood music was certainly different.\u201d POLITICO\n\nMEDIAWATCH \u2026 NEWSMAX inked a new carriage distribution agreement with Cox, which they believe will put the conservative news organization in the homes of 3 million subscribers in California, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia.\n\n-- \u201cAs a foreign reporter visiting the US I was stunned by Trump's press conference,\u201d by Guardian\u2019s Lenore Taylor\n\nCLICKER \u2013 \u201cThe nation\u2019s cartoonists on the week in politics,\u201d edited by Matt Wuerker -- 18 funnies\n\n\n\nA message from Softbank: Learn more about SoftBank's investment in the U.S. and watch our new video at politico.com/sponsor-content/softbank.\n\nGREAT WEEKEND READS, curated by Daniel Lippman (@dlippman), filing from New York:\n\n-- \u201cAmerica, the Gerontocracy,\u201d by Tim Noah in POLITICO Magazine: \u201cIn 1982 ... the median age of a Politburo member was 71. ...
