Catherine has been wooden and stompy for weeks, not much improvement from week to week. Mike was technically better last night. @ShirleyBallas has a tough job, but she had to do it, the Twitter hate campaign will stop soon enough\".\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut she didn't stop there. Shirley liked another and it suggested fellow judge Craig Revel-Horwood should also receive some of the blame for sending Catherine home.\n\nAnother said: \"My god do I feel sorry for @ShirleyBallas getting all this abuse! She had a job to do and she used her professional experience. Why does that deserve death threats. And why isn't Craig getting the same backlash? His vote contributed to it all! People need to grow up\".\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nIt comes as Shirley has previously received death threats from fans after Dev Griffin was kicked out of the competition - and viewers even called for Len Goodman to return.\n\nSpeaking at the Pride of Britain Awards, she blamed the fans for the head judge told Mirror Online: \"I just have one question for the viewers. Why was she in the bottom two? That's my question.\n\n\"When we have to judge it we do what we feel and it came down to my choice this week. I stand by it 100%.\n\n\"I absolutely adored [Catherine] in past weeks. She did really well. She was just unfortunate this week.\"", "description": "Head judge Shirley Ballas criticises Catherine Tyldesley's dancing as she likes tweet calling her 'wooden and stompy'", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Pa", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20750590.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Shirley-Ballas-comments.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
