Uncertainty over future trade agreements with the EU and other countries could leave companies in the lurch and unsure how to prepare for the different possible outcomes of those trade agreements.\n\nThe other scenario, that Brexit is once again extended, would also mean continued uncertainty over the future. As BoE Governor Mark Carney pointed out earlier this month, this scenario could also lead to a rate cut.\n\nAnd then finally, the no deal Brexit. Mark Carney and the government itself (think yellowhammer) have painted a pretty grim picture for the UK economy and under this scenario, which would inevitably be bad news for the pound.\n\nPound traders are finding little to be cheerful over this morning, Saunders\u2019 comments dented an already weak sentiment surrounding the pound. Brexit talks later today are unlikely to be a source of optimism either.\n\nLevels to watch :\n\nGBP/USD Chart\n\nThe pound dropped 0.3% and is trading at three-week lows. A break below $1.23 has set the stage for further depreciation to $1.2270. A breakthrough here could see the pair slip back towards $1.22. On the flip side, resistance can be seen at $1.2370 prior to $1.2400.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Fiona Cincotta covering: GBP/USD.
