The prices at which it can deliver electricity to utilities \u201ccould be lower without those tariff prices,\u201d he said Friday in an interview at Bloomberg\u2018s offices in Washington.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the tariffs that were imposed on solar panels in 2018, he said. Duties on steel and inverters are also boosting installation costs. All that has become a drag on the U.S. solar industry, according to Smith. Lightsource is partly owned by BP (LON: ) Plc.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be 10,000, 12,000 megawatts of solar built in the U.S. in 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could have been more without those tariffs.\u201d\n\nSmith stressed that even with the tariffs, solar is still an attractive, low-cost option for utilities and corporate buyers inking deals to buy it. \u201cSolar energy is still being viewed in a lot of markets as the cheapest source of energy supply, and you win projects on that basis,\u201d he said.", "description": "Trump\u2019s Tariffs Drag Down U.S. Solar Industry, Developer Says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic6d39e5b7580f6b7150d4f60feb4ecfab.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
