The enormous move to the upside in Hong Kong spread around the world. Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, called for the withdrawal of the extradition of the bill, and that set the tone for the markets yesterday.\n\n\n\nEuropean and US equity markets finished higher as there was some positive news for a change. The Hang Seng closed up nearly 4%, and the bullish sentiment rippled out around the world. At the height of the unrest in Hong Kong, President Trump warned Beijing they should handle the situation in a \u2018humane\u2019 way, so the cooling of tensions in Hong Kong could help with the trade dispute between the US and China.\n\n\n\nIt was announced overnight that US and Chinese delegates would meet in October to discuss trade. Combined with the developments in Hong Kong, it helped the positive outlook in Asia. US equity index futures have been given a boost, and European stock markets are called high too. The news came from China\u2019s ministry of commerce, but a US representative confirmed the phone call, but not the October meeting, so the positive move might be on hollow ground.\n\n\n\nSterling soared yesterday in tandem with the chaos of UK politics. MPs voted in favor of delaying the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, and to make matters worse for Prime Minister Johnson, lawmakers voted against holding a snap general election. Amid the madness of British politics, the pound rallied on the news, as the possibility of a no-deal Brexit has been pushed back in the near-term.\n\n\n\nTo a lesser extent, the broadly positive services PMI data from China and the eurozone helped shape the positive mood yesterday. Earlier this week we saw largely poor manufacturing readings from the major economies of the currency bloc, and as we saw yesterday, the services sector in the region is in rude health, and that added to the optimistic sentiment.\n\n\n\nGold gained ground yesterday on the back of a sharp drop in the US dollar. The metal has typically moved higher on the back of a softer US dollar, but the positive move in stocks points to a risk-on attitude, and that acted as a cap to gold\u2019s positive move.\n\n\n\nAt 7 am (UK time), Germany will post the industrial orders report, and economists are expecting a decline of 1.5%, which would be a sharp decline from the 2.5% growth registered in the previous update.\n\n\n\nThe US will reveal a couple of jobs reports today. The ADP employment report and the jobless claims report will be announced at 1.15pm (UK time) and 1.30pm (UK time), and economists are expecting 149,000 and 215,000 respectively.\n\n\n\nAt 3 pm, the US factory orders update will be announced, and dealers are expecting 1%, and the ISM non-manufacturing report will be posted at the same time, and dealers are expecting 53.3.\n\n\n\nThe energy information report will be posted at 4 pm (UK time), and oil stockpiles are tipped to fall 2.48 million barrels, and gasoline inventories are expected to fall by 1.52 million barrels.\n\n\n\n\u2013 remains in the wider downward trend of 2019, and if the bearish moves continue, it might target the 1.0900 area. A move back through 1.1000, might pave the way for 1.1164 to be retested.\n\n\n\n\u2013 Tuesday\u2019s daily candle has the potential to be a hammer, and a break above the 1.2200 area might bring 1.2309 into play. Support might be found at 1.1900, should the wider bearish move continue.\n\n\n\n\u2013 the weekly candle from mid-August appears to be a bearish reversal, and if the downward movement continues, it might target 0.8872. A rebound in the currency pair might bring 0.9200 into play.\n\n\n\n\u2013 rebounded last week, and a break above the 107.00 area, might bring 108.47 (100-day moving average) into play. Should the wider downtrend continue, it might retest the 104.50 area.\n\n\n\nis expected to open 31 points higher at 7,342\n\n\n\nis expected to open 120 points higher at 12,145\n\n\n\nis expected to open 52 points higher at 5,584\n\nDISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution-only provider.
