It has also propelled the candidacy of Alberto Fernandez, whose surge has sent jitters in the financial markets over a possible return to interventionist polices of Cristina Fernandez's 2007-2015 administration.\n\nMacri's camp has tried to capitalise on that unease, portraying her as a puppet master waiting in the wings. But the presidential candidate has dismissed those fears and voters gave him a decisive victory over Macri in August primaries, which are a barometer of support for candidates ahead of the presidential election.\n\n\"I don't see a conflict there,\" Alberto Fernandez said recently in an interview with The Associated Press. \"Argentina's problem is not Cristina. It's what Macri has left behind.\"\n\nFernandez served as chief of staff from 2003 to 2007 for Cristina Fernandez's predecessor and late husband, Nestor Kirchner. He remained in the position during a portion of her term as president but left after a conflict with farmers in 2008.\n\nPeronism is a broad and splintered political movement that many Argentines claim some allegiance to.\n\nOn the election trail, Fernandez has criticised Macri's decision to seek a record $US56 billion ($82 billion) bailout from the International Monetary Fund, a deeply unpopular institution in Argentina that is blamed for creating the conditions that led to the country's worst economic meltdown in 2001.\n\nMacri is credited with returning Argentina to international global markets following a break after the 2001 crisis and with helping strike a free trade deal between South America's Mercosur bloc and the European Union amid global trade tensions and rising protectionism. But he failed to deliver on promises to jump-start the economy of the recession-hit country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the campaign trail, Macri has pleaded for more time to reverse fortunes and reminds voters of the corruption cases facing Cristina Fernandez, who has denied any wrongdoing and remains a powerful if divisive figure in Argentina.\n\nTo avoid a runoff on Nov.ember 24, a candidate needs to win 45 per cent of the vote, or 40 per cent support with a 10 percentage point lead over the nearest rival. Nearly all recent surveys give Fernandez more than 50 per cent support, which would guarantee his outright victory in a first round.\n\nNearly 34 million Argentines were eligible to vote in Sunday's election. Argentines were also set to pick 130 lower house seats and 24 senators in Congress, as well as regional mayors, governors for three provinces and the head of government for the Argentine capital.\n\nAAP", "description": "Poverty under the current President has soared, the value of the local currency has sharply depreciated and the inflation rate remains among the highest in the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3215%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_172%2C$y_30/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6a60ee7271be6bf20bbfd2dd68a22b45030de567", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
