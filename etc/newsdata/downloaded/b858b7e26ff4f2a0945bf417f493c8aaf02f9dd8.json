While Markle\u2019s business manager, Andrew Meyer, reportedly filed documents allowing her to keep ownership of the website until 2021, it was apparently only done as a precaution so nobody capitalized on the name without Markle\u2019s permission.\n\nAccording to People, a palace spokesperson confirmed that there are no plans to relaunch the Tig. \u201cThe lasting trademark is to prevent false branding, to avoid others purporting to be the Duchess or affiliated with her,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nAfter launching the website in 2014, Markle shared the usual lifestyle blog content, like shopping picks, travel recommendations, recipes, and interviews with celebrities, including her close friend, Serena Williams. Markle decided to shut it down in April 2017, a few months before she became engaged to Prince Harry. Imagine giving up your blog for the throne!\n\nIn her goodbye post, which can still be seen on the the Tig\u2019s landing page, Markle wrote that it was time to say goodbye to her \u201cpassion project,\u201d and encouraged her readers to keep \u201cfinding those Tig moments of discovery, keep laughing and taking risks, and keep being \u2018the change you wish to see in the world.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe celebrity lifestyle market may currently be ruled by Martha Stewart, Reese Witherspoon, Jessica Alba, and Goop, but a Meghan Markle blogging comeback would have been a true joy. I , for one, would have looked forward to an autumnal stew recipe from the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nStay in touch.
