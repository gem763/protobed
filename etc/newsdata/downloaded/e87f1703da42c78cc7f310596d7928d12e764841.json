The study evaluated different appliance-makers based on information the organization collected from members on more than 381,000 kitchen and laundry appliances purchased between 2008 and 2018.\n\nSpeed Queen, a company that exclusively manufactures clothes washers and dryers came was No. 1 in Consumer Reports\u2019 ranking.\n\nSpeed Queen, a company that exclusively manufactures clothes washers and dryers, was No. 1 in the ranking.\n\nTo rank the brands, Consumer Reports asked members how often the appliance broke or stopped working adequately. It looked at eight different types of appliances: refrigerators, dishwashers, ranges, cooking tops, wall ovens, over-the-range microwaves, washers and dryers.\n\nRead more: These features could boost your home\u2019s sale price by over 30%\n\nConsumers rated reliability as more important than price or performance in determining which appliance they purchased, said Eric Hagerman, home editor at Consumer Reports.\n\n\u201cThe stakes are high for major appliances,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are really expensive products that you buy for your home. They\u2019re things you have to have installed and they basically become a part of your home.\u201d\n\nAppliance brand ranking Speed Queen Miele Ikea LG Thermador Bosch GE Kenmore Whirlpool Maytag Sub-Zero/Wolff Frigidaire Estate Hotpoint Roper KitchenAid Samsung JennAir Asko Fisher & Paykel Dacor Electrolux Viking\n\nAs for brands that produce appliances across all eight product categories, LG 066570, +2.61% came out on top, followed by Bosch, General Electric HRELF, +1.98% and Kenmore SHLDQ, +0.57%.\n\nMeanwhile, brands that ranked in the bottom half of the pack included KitchenAid WHR, +0.58%, Samsung SSNLF, +0.00% and Electrolux ELUXF, +4.69%.\n\nRoughly 40% of all refrigerators had problems crop up in the first five years after they were purchased, as did 30% of washers and 25% of ranges.\n\nNotably, Viking MIDD, -0.19%, which sells expensive, chef-grade appliances, came in last on the Consumer Reports ranking. A Viking gas range can cost upwards of $15,000.\n\n\u201cThe reliability rating doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the price they charge or the marketing campaign,\u201d Hagerman said.\n\nAlso see: Remember the price spikes for appliances after Trump\u2019s tariffs? Well, they\u2019re fading away\n\nViking president Kevin Brown defended the brand\u2019s products in an email to MarketWatch. \u201cWe are confident in the quality of today\u2019s Viking products,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSince Middleby\u2019s purchase of Viking in 2013, Viking has completely re-engineered the entire Viking product line and has implemented 100% testing to ensure the best reliability, quality and customer satisfaction.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for GE Appliances said the company had not yet seen the results of the study and could not yet offer comment. MarketWatch contacted the other companies for comment, but has not yet received any response.\n\nA spokeswoman for JennAir said, \u201cJennAir is committed to exceptional performance, masterful execution and provocative design; reliability and owner satisfaction are at the core of everything we do.\u201d Customers who have problems with the brand\u2019s appliances are encouraged to call the company (1-800-JENNAIR) where \u201cdedicated specialists will connect them to the troubleshooting they need or set an appointment for timely white-glove service,\u201d she said.\n\nA Miele spokesman said the company was \u201cpleased\u201d with its No. 2 ranking. \u201cMiele is the only manufacturer in our branch of industry to test products such as our washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers and ovens to the equivalent up to 20 years\u2019 use,\u201d said spokesman Kevin Pchola.\n\nThe rankings are predictions based on previous customer experiences, meaning there are some happy Electrolux customers and disappointed Speed Queen buyers out there.\n\nMoreover, some appliances are more prone to breaking down. Roughly 40% of all refrigerators had problems crop up in the first five years after they were purchased, as did 30% of washers and 25% of ranges.\n\nAnd while maintenance won\u2019t necessarily double the life span of an appliance, it can improve its working condition and prevent major calamities from arising. Keeping appliances clean, inspecting their different parts regularly and treating them with care (don\u2019t slam the microwave door, for instance) can go a long way in keep them in fine condition.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "description": "This ranking evaluates the reliability of appliance-makers using real-world data.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HL750_applia_ZG_20190619180909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-20"}
