He said the company, which provides cloud-based collaboration and file-sharing software is focused on accelerating growth and improving profitability while cutting back on sales and marketing costs in the coming quarters.\n\nBox is aiming to sell more of its products to each customer to yield more revenue from its existing client base. That approach could help explain why Starboard sees the stock as undervalued.\n\n\"We see a tremendous amount of opportunity within our customer base, as well as the new logos we're going after,\" Levie said.\n\nIn the most recent quarter Box broke even, excluding certain items, on revenue that was up 16% from the prior year. Even after the recent rally, the stock is up just 2.8% this year and remains down 27% over the past 12 months, badly trailing the S&P 500.\n\nLevie said those struggles haven't caused him to change his view on the company's 2015 IPO.\n\n\"I don't regret going public at all,\" he said.\n\nWATCH: Box CEO Aaron Levie: We're still in early stages of the cloud", "description": "Box CEO Aaron Levie said his company's interests are aligned with those of new investor Starboard.", "authors": ["Jordan Novet"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104683835-IMG_3200.JPG?v=1519933762", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
