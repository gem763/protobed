A return to full production at the mine, which produces about 30 million tonnes a year or over 82,000 tonnes a day, could take longer still.\n\nThe shutdown at the mine has left some power plants in eastern and central India scrambling to secure alternative supplies of fuel.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to achieve 30,000 tonnes production per day from the upper and middle benches of the mine in 10 days,\u201d Dayal said.\n\n\u201cWe will start pumping out water from the lower benches where water has become quite voluminous and that will take at least a month.\u201d\n\nA video shot on Monday by a volunteer at rights group Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan showed black water gushing down a slope and into the mine.\n\nReuters could not independently authenticate the video.\n\nA senior official at South Eastern Coalfields, a unit of Coal India which operates the mine, said efforts to pump out water from the mine were being conducted on a \u201cwar footing.\u201d\n\nThe official, who did not wish to be named, said water inflows into the mine had eased considerably.\n\nCoal India\u2019s production has been hampered by the heaviest monsoon rains in India in 25 years, with seasonal rains continuing for longer than expected.\n\nThe company, which has consistently missed annual production targets over the last few years, wants to produce 660 million tonnes during the year ending March 2020, up 8.7% from 2018/19.\n\nDayal said it will try to achieve the ambitious target by ramping up production at other mines.\n\n\u201cWe are working out an emergency plan, we will try to achieve the target,\u201d he said.", "description": "Coal India Ltd has resumed some production at its Dipka mine after flooding and aims to have at least a third of output back up and running within 10 days, a company official said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Sudarshan Varadhan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
