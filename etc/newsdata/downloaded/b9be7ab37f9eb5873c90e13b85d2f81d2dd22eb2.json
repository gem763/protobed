Now follows a few days of well needed rest while enjoying the spectacular nature of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.

Lead by example ! \u2014@CanuckGTA\n\nPriya Mignault with Fridays for Future Calgary \u2014 a local chapter of the larger movement inspired by Thunberg \u2014 said she has been attending climate strikes since March.\n\n\"She was the only person striking last year, but now there's millions, which I think is incredible,\" Mignault said. \"I definitely think it was about time. All of us youth really needed a leader, and I think Greta just happened to be that.\"\n\nMignault said she hoped that Thunberg was aware of Alberta's context as an oil and gas industry.\n\n\"A whole lot of Albertans make their money on that and that's how a lot of Albertans are fed. So I hope she considers that,\" she said. \"But I'm aware that a lot of us who are climate activists are trying to push for renewable energies and transition away from oil and gas.\"\n\nPriya Mignault with Fridays for Future Calgary said she was very enthusiastic about Thunberg's upcoming visit. (Helen Pike/CBC)\n\nEvan Kayne said he hoped those working in the oil and gas industry would use Thunberg's visit as an opportunity to learn.\n\n\"Oil and gas is not going to go away overnight, but we need to find a better way,\" he said. \"Screaming about it, blaming a 16-year-old and getting angry at a 16-year-old girl for saying, 'The emperor has no clothes' is not the way to handle things.\"", "description": "Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg will travel to Alberta after a series of appearances in the United States.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5301655.1569702033!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/climate-change-strike-canada.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
