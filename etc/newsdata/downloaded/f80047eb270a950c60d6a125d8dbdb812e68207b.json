I went in for a handshake. He hugged me.\n\nWhat did you talk about?\n\nFrom current affairs to Kim Woodburn, no stone was left unturned.\n\nAny awkward moments?\n\nHe talked at length about Fleabag, which I had heard of but knew nothing about. I must have looked like a glazed, uncultured potato.\n\nGood table manners?\n\nHe dropped a bit of sweet-and-sour sauce on the table, but he\u2019s veggie, too, so he was forgiven.\n\nBest thing about Ollie?\n\nHis energy. He encouraged me to ask for a second bottle of free wine \u2013 a good quality in a person.\n\nWould you introduce him to your friends?\n\nYeah, I think so. Turns out we have a few mutuals already.\n\nDescribe him in three words\n\nBourgeois. Intellectual. Handsome.\n\nWhat do you think he made of you?\n\nHe hinted I undo more buttons on my shirt. I think he thought I was sex on legs, to be honest.\n\nDid you go on somewhere?\n\nYes, to the nearest Wetherspoon. We were out until 1am. I\u2019m exhausted just thinking about it.\n\nAnd... did you kiss?\n\nMultiple times. For quite a while, tbh.\n\nIf you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t have moved on to beer. Bad idea.\n\nMarks out of 10?\n\n8.\n\nWould you meet again?\n\nWhy not?\n\nOllie on David\n\nWhat were you hoping for?\n\nTo avoid being publicly shamed.\n\nFirst impressions?\n\nWell-dressed, friendly and very attentive.\n\nWhat did you talk about?\n\nMasculinity, Grindr, the appropriate number of shirt buttons to undo on a first date.\n\nAny awkward moments?\n\nTrying to fleece a second free bottle of wine from a very lovely waiter \u2013 not our best moment.\n\nGood table manners?\n\nWe were both outshone by Kelly Holmes on the table next to us, who lent us some chopsticks.\n\nBest thing about David?\n\nA great conversationalist and a lot of fun. He asked interesting questions.\n\nWould you introduce him to your friends?\n\n\n\nFor sure.\n\nDescribe him in three words\n\nThoughtful, warm, handsome.\n\nWhat do you think he made of you?\n\nHopefully, open and relaxed, although he did say I didn\u2019t seem used to first dates.\n\nDid you go on somewhere?\n\nSoho \u2019Spoons, of course.\n\nAnd... did you kiss?\n\nYes.\n\nIf you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?\n\nFor him not to have the same name as my dad. And probably to have drunk a bit less.\n\nMarks out of 10?\n\n8.\n\nWould you meet again?\n\nI hope so!\n\n\u2022 Ollie and David ate at The Banana Tree Soho, London W1. Fancy a blind date?
