That's why school-ranking website Niche released its 2020 list of public high schools in America with the best teachers. Being a teacher isn't easy: Many teachers have a range of issues to grapple with, from dealing with helicopter parents to using their own salary to pay for classroom supplies.\n\nThe methodology for Niche's teacher rankings is based on factors like teacher ratings by parents and students, teacher salaries, days absent, teacher tenure, student-teacher ratio, and Niche's academics rating for the school. All of that data was drawn from Niche user ratings, the US Department of Education, and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).\n\nThe top spot went to the Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science, which is in Columbus, Mississippi. Charter schools also made up a significant portion of the list, with three of the top 10 being part of the BASIS school system, a worldwide network of charter schools with 27 tuition-free locations in the US.\n\nHere are the 15 US public high schools with the best teachers.", "description": "The rankings are based on factors like student and parent reviews, student-teacher ratio, and teacher tenure.", "authors": ["Ivan De Luce"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d682fc62e22af29135371b3-1136-568.jpg"}
