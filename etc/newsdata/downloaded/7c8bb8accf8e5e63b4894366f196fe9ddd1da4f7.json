The ministry tweeted: \"Ras al-Ayn's residential center has been taken under control through the successful operations in the east of Euphrates\" river.\n\nAn Associated Press journalist across the border heard the sound of sporadic clashes as Turkish howitzers struck the town and Turkish jets screeched overhead.\n\nSyrian Kurdish forces appeared to be holding out in some areas of the town.\n\nThe Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces released two videos said to be from inside Ras al-Ayn, showing fighters saying that it is Saturday and they are still there.\n\nThe fighting was ongoing as the Kurdish fighters sought to reverse the Turkish advance into Ras Al-Ayn, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.\n\nThe push deeper into northern Syria by Turkish troops came days after U.S. President Donald Trump cleared the way for Turkey's air and ground invasion, pulling back U.S. forces from the area and saying he wanted to stop getting involved with \"endless wars.\"\n\nTrump's decision drew swift bipartisan criticism that he was endangering regional stability and risking the lives of Syrian Kurdish allies who brought down the Islamic State group in Syria. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces was the main U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State group and had lost 11,000 fighters in the nearly five-year battle against the extremists.\n\nEarlier in the day, Turkish troops moved to seize control of key highways in northeastern Syria, the Turkish military and the Observatory said.\n\nTurkey's state-run Anadolu news agency said that Turkey-backed Syrian opposition forces had taken control of the M-4 highway that connects the towns of Manbij and Qamishli.\n\nThe SDF said that Turkish troops and their Syrian allies reached the highway briefly before being pushed back again.\n\nTurkish troops also cut the route linking the northeastern city of Hassakeh with Aleppo, Syria's largest city and once commercial center, according to the Observatory.\n\nSince Wednesday, Turkish troops and Syrian opposition fighters backed by Ankara have been advancing under the cover of airstrikes and artillery shelling, reaching the Manbij-Qamishli road about 30 kilometers (19 miles) south of the Turkish border.\n\nTurkey has said it aims to push back the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, which it considers terrorists for its links to a decades-long Kurdish insurgency within its own borders. The YPG is a main component of the SDF.\n\nThe U.N. estimated the number of displaced at 100,000 since Wednesday, saying that markets, schools and clinics also were closed. Aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian crisis, with nearly a half-million people at risk in northeastern Syria.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday Turkey won't stop until the Syrian Kurdish forces withdraw below a 32 kilometer (20 miles) deep line from the border.\n\nThe Turkish military aims to clear Syrian border towns of Kurdish fighters' presence, saying they are a national security threat.", "description": "Turkish forces captured a key Syrian border town under heavy bombardment Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106177713-1570825495130gettyimages-1175345568.jpeg?v=1570825521", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
