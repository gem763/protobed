And, because it\u2019s being built not in a factory but out in the open, it\u2019s become a roadside attraction, drawing gawkers to an area so remote that the county trucks in drinking water once a month to the few who live nearby.\n\nThey\u2019re coming to see Elon Musk\u2019s latest creation, a prototype called Starship that he hopes will one day carry people by the dozens to the moon and Mars. Musk, in a presentation here Saturday, said his goal of building a \u201crapidly reusable spacecraft\u201d here would lead to the fulfillment of his ultimate goal of creating \u201ca city on Mars.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut first, he\u2019ll need to pull off another improbable feat, building a private, commercial spaceport here, in what the top local elected official called a \u201cmind-boggling\u201d juxtaposition: SpaceX, one of the hottest companies in the world, led by a Silicon Valley celebrity with nearly 29 million Twitter followers, building a rocket in a border town where nearly a third of the residents live below the poverty line.\n\n\u201cI never in a million years would have imagined it,\u201d said Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevi\u00f1o Jr.\n\nFive years ago, SpaceX started building a launchpad here, hauling in dirt by the ton, that would allow the company a measure of freedom without the restraints that come with shooting rockets off from government sites, such as Cape Canaveral or Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, where several other companies operate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is really going to be a new kind of spaceport that is optimized for commercial operations,\u201d Musk said during a groundbreaking ceremony in 2014. \u201cCape Canaveral and Cape Vandenberg are great launch sites, but they are military launch sites.\u201d\n\nThe company has been welcomed by local officials as a Walt Disney-like messiah that would help spark an economic revival in an area that desperately needs it. The state set aside $15.3 million to help the company build its facilities here and has bought into SpaceX\u2019s vision to transform the area into a commercial spaceport that would be sending people throughout the solar system.\n\n\u201cYou know the term \u2018visionary\u2019; they\u2019re the ones who make the world go 'round,\u201d Trevi\u00f1o said.\n\nAD\n\nOutside the county courthouse, the downtown here is replete with boarded-up businesses. Real estate prices are depressed. Schools are surrounded by security fences. For years, the area has been caught in an unending \u201cvicious cycle,\u201d Trevi\u00f1o said, so bad that people who \u201care fortunate to get a college education or a postgraduate degree don\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhile he knows SpaceX\u2019s presence has led to \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d he said those are merely the turbulent spasms of progress in an area that has seen very little.\n\nBut now, across the water on South Padre Island, the county has spent about $31 million building new pavilions and an amphitheater that would host concerts and weddings and make a prime viewing area for rocket launches. Local officials hope for a future where residents and tourists line the beach, the way they have for years along Florida\u2019s Space Coast, cheering rockets as they tear through the sky.\n\nAD\n\nThe comeback coast\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d said Sofia Benavides, a county commissioner who represents Boca Chica. \u201cI\u2019m 69 years old and have never been to a rocket launch. For my children and grandchildren, it\u2019s great that this is happening in their backyard.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is cheering, though.\n\nAD\n\nA handful of residents who live next door to SpaceX\u2019s facilities recently received letters from SpaceX, which said the company\u2019s footprint in the area was going to be bigger and more disruptive than originally imagined. As a result, it was seeking to purchase their properties at three times the value determined by an appraiser hired by SpaceX. The deal was nonnegotiable, the letter said, and the company wanted an answer within two weeks, although some have received extensions.\n\nCalled Boca Chica Village, the area is made up of about 30 homes within walking distance of the Gulf of Mexico, occupied mostly seasonally. Many are boarded up. A few have weeds as high as the mailboxes.\n\nThe few full-time residents moved here seeking an end-of-the-road refuge. It\u2019s nothing fancy \u2014 an outpost with little more than surf and sun and spotty cell reception, where fishermen drive their trucks up on the beach. There\u2019s no running water, so the county brings in giant water tanks for residents once a month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRay Pointer discovered the area by accident in 2002. He was trying to make his way to South Padre Island, the resort town just to the north but, instead, made a wrong turn, ended up in Boca Chica and decided he had found an oasis where he would plant his flag.\n\nHis neighbor Bonnie Heaton moved to Boca Chica 18 years ago from Minnesota with her husband after they retired. It was a place so desolate and tranquil she recalled the UPS delivery man once saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone lived out here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe came across this place and never left,\u201d she said.\n\nThe letter from SpaceX, then, came as a shock, one that she said felt like \u201ca hostile takeover.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thought of a company that\u2019s going to shoot a rocket to the moon or Mars, that\u2019s exciting, that\u2019s history,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you get to the other side of the coin, and you lose your house, it\u2019s terrifying.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRay Pointer and his wife, Maria, feel the same way. They were offered $233,000 for their home, Ray Pointer, 72, said, a figure he believes is outlandishly low. (Zillow estimates the value of their home at $103,655.)\n\n\u201cTo tell me to leave and not really compensate me is unconscionable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not the right thing to do. SpaceX is better than that.\u201d\n\nWhile many of their neighbors, who don\u2019t live in Boca Chica year round, have taken the offer, they continue to try to negotiate.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a NASA astronaut in the celebrity space age?\n\nTo Trevi\u00f1o and other local officials, moving a few residents is a small price to pay to make way for SpaceX and its starry ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe have to think big-picture,\u201d Trevi\u00f1o said. \u201cAnd the fact that an individual with the vision like Elon Musk is investing his time, his money and his efforts to build his dream of launching to the moon and Mars here \u2014 it\u2019s important that we be a part of that.\u201d\n\nSpaceX chose the area because of its location and comparative desolation \u2014 you want to launch rockets near the equator and over unpopulated areas. On Saturday night, Musk was here himself, to show off the rocket his team had been working to complete and to discuss his vision of the future. As for the rocket ranch he is building, he said it would continue to grow with more buildings and increased activity that forced the company to buy out residents\u2019 property.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInitially, SpaceX had intended to launch its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets from here. But as the concept for Starship began to form in his imagination, he decided to switch gears and make Boca Chica home to the new, massive rocket he hopes will take people deep into the solar system.\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot more buildings and a lot more stuff \u2014 way more stuff than is currently here,\u201d he said. A sense of urgency to get Starship built led the company to do it in the ramshackle way it has \u2014 outside, without a factory in sight, in a barren setting fit for Star Wars that, as he wrote on Twitter earlier this month, could be labeled \u201cDroid Junkyard, Tatooine.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince it was going to take too long to build the buildings we built [Starship] outside,\u201d he said. \u201cMy new thing is management by rhyming: If the schedule is long, it\u2019s wrong; if it\u2019s tight, it\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost of the presentation focused on technical details, the benefits of stainless steel vs. carbon composites (\u201cI\u2019m in love with steel,\u201d he said at one point), orbital mechanics, reentry vectors (\u201cIt\u2019ll look totally nuts to see this thing land.\u201d), the importance of orbital refueling and a future where humanity is \u201cout among the stars.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe critical breakthrough that\u2019s needed for us to become a spacefaring civilization is to make space travel like air travel,\u201d Musk said. The first flight of the test vehicle \u2014 which looks as if it were born from a collaboration between Wernher von Braun, the designer of the Saturn V Apollo-era rocket, and Frank Gehry, the modernist architect \u2014 would come within a couple of months, he said, a short, suborbital hop to about 12 miles high.\n\nSaturday\u2019s presentation was the latest in a series of grand space talks that Musk\u2019s fans have lauded as visionary and critics have derided as fantasy. But for all the hype SpaceX has received, and for the myriad times Musk has talked about making humanity a \u201cmulti-planet species,\u201d it still has not flown a single human being anywhere, let alone the moon or to Mars.\n\nAll the talk, then, of futuristic spaceships and deep space exploration rubbed NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine the wrong way. SpaceX is preparing to fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station under a contract worth $2.6 billion. SpaceX, like Boeing, the other company hired to fly astronauts to the station, is years behind schedule. And in April, SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon capsule, designed to carry the crews, exploded during a test of its emergency abort engines.\n\nIn a tweet Friday, Bridenstine took the bold and unusual step of firing a shot at the company, saying that while was looking forward to SpaceX\u2019s announcement, the agency \u201cexpects to see the same level of enthusiasm focused on the investments of the American taxpayer. It\u2019s time to deliver.\u201d\n\nIn response Saturday, Musk said that the company\u2019s \u201cresources are overwhelmingly on Falcon and Dragon,\u201d the rocket and spacecraft that would be used to fly NASA astronauts. And company officials stressed that flying NASA\u2019s astronauts is SpaceX\u2019s top priority.\n\nBut Musk\u2019s focus is clearly on the next-generation spacecraft he has been envisioning for years, one that has gone through multiple iterations and is still evolving, a stubborn problem not fully solved.\n\nMeantime, Bonnie Heaton wonders where she\u2019ll go next and whether she\u2019ll ever be able to afford another place so close to the water, where during the evening, the \u201csun melts into the ocean,\u201d she said.\n\nThere is one thing she knows for sure, though: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to Mars. Let him do that.\u201d", "description": "On a spit of Texas land past the Border Patrol checkpoint, where the Rio Grande meets the Gulf of Mexico, there is a spaceship being assembled off State Highway 4 just before it dead-ends into the sea.
