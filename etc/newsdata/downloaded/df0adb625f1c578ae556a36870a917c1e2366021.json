That\u2019s not because the staff hasn\u2019t figured out who\u2019s the best player. It\u2019s that injuries have shattered all hope of stability.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat's the one position where in a perfect world, you want a guy that is your guy,\u201d Coach Michael Locksley said. \u201cYou build around him. You build around his skill set.\u201d\n\nThis week, it appears Maryland will lean on its first-choice quarterback, Josh Jackson, the graduate transfer from Virginia Tech. He practiced with the first-team group Tuesday and said he feels back to himself. Jackson proved to be a reliable passer early in the season before he struggled a bit and then suffered a high ankle sprain against Rutgers. He\u2019s had a few weeks to recover. Both Jackson and Locksley seem optimistic.\n\nBut then again, Locksley said last week Jackson had returned to 100 percent and would play against Minnesota. Jackson did indeed play, but only for three snaps. Locksley decided to revert to backup Tyrrell Pigrome on the following series. When Jackson spoke with Locksley on the sideline after missing his receiver on third down, Locksley said, \u201cI didn't really feel like he had his confidence.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo Pigrome led the team until he hurt his knee. Tyler DeSue finished the game after spending the week primarily working with the scout team.\n\nFrom his teammates\u2019 perspective, DeSue\u2019s outing showed \u201ca lot of guts,\u201d senior offensive lineman Ellis McKennie said, noting DeSue\u2019s first career touchdown, a 59-yard pass to running back Tayon Fleet-Davis. DeSue had hardly worked with the second-team offense in the week leading up to the game, one in which he ultimately took a significant number of snaps for Maryland.\n\n\u201cThey try to teach everybody everything we're going to run,\u201d said DeSue, who threw for 88 yards while completing four of his 12 passes. \u201cI knew what we were doing conceptually, but I hadn't seen it all week. It's still no excuse. \u2026 Getting put in the game, it was a little bit of a shock at first, trying to figure out how the looks were and what it looked like in person, rather than just seeing it on film.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore the season, just after Jackson earned the starting job, he downplayed his school\u2019s history of injuries at the position, joking that Maryland didn\u2019t mention that in the recruiting pitch.\n\nPigrome has played all the roles in the position\u2019s revolving door. In 2017, Pigrome earned the starting job but tore his ACL during the opener against Texas. The next season, Kasim Hill, who has since transferred to Tennessee, received the spot ahead of Pigrome, but Pigrome stepped in as the starter for the final two games after Hill tore his ACL. This year, Pigrome has started three games and dealt with minor injuries, most recently a hyperextended knee against Minnesota. Pigrome practiced in a limited capacity Tuesday, taking part in primarily individual drills, but he hopes he will be available Saturday.\n\nAfter watching all those injuries unfold over the past few years, a reporter asked whether Pigrome has ever thought that they\u2019ve \u2014 then Pigrome chimes in to finish the question \u2014 \u201cgot bad luck here? Yeah,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI said that before. I\u2019m just joking about it. It\u2019s kind of weird here, though.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFortunately for Maryland, this year\u2019s setbacks haven\u2019t been of the season-ending variety. Jackson\u2019s ankle injury sparked concern when it took few minutes before trainers helped him off the field. Jackson broke his fibula last year at Virginia Tech, and those moments on the turf at Rutgers prompted some flashbacks for Maryland\u2019s starter.\n\nWith the injury last week, Pigrome knew immediately he hadn\u2019t torn his ACL like he did in 2017. (\u201cThe ACL pop is different,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to know when you mess that up.\u201d) In Maryland\u2019s previous matchup against Indiana, Pigrome limped off the field and into the injury tent, but he returned for the following drive. After that game, Pigrome said he felt a pop in his same knee but still not one that indicates torn ligaments. (\u201cThat\u2019s a different pop, too,\u201d he said, showing off the topical expertise no player wants to have.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs Pigrome compared the injuries and wondered about the fate of quarterbacks who enter this program, his optimism never wavered. He\u2019s confident he\u2019ll be back soon. Jackson shrugged off any concerns, too, preferring to instead worry about this game in front of him. Perhaps then, if Jackson does show he\u2019s returned to full strength against Michigan, this quarterback carousel will finally stop turning.\n\nRead more on college sports:\n\nAD", "description": "Injuries have created a lack of continuity in starting quarterbacks, but this weekend against Michigan, it's likely Josh Jackson.", "authors": ["Emily Giambalvo", "Reporter Covering University Of Maryland Athletics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1zNg0-V30Jz4rmcXEH9zYz0NKt0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UJMAR4WRTAI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
