Adam Schiff, not that he cares, will nonetheless stand for a test of fire from fellow House Republicans who are forcing a vote on his censure.\n\nWhat good will the vote do? Likely: Little. The House is Democratic-controlled and honestly, censuring someone as \u201cshifty\u201d as Schiff, as Rep. Jody Hice calls him, would have about as much effect on controlling his anti-President Donald Trump rhetoric, behavior and performances as pelting him with marshmallows.\n\nBut let the vote commence. No sense wasting good marshmallows.\n\n\u201cBig vote tonight as the House finally votes on censuring the shifty & dishonest @RepAdamSchiff,\u201d Hice tweeted.\n\nHice went on: \u201cCensure shows the House\u2019s deep disapproval of a Members\u2019 behavior and, if passed, he must stand in the well while @SpeakerPelosi formally rebukes his lies, corruption and misconduct.\u201d\n\nFellow Republican representative Andy Biggs, meanwhile, tweeted this: \u201cTonight, I will force a vote on my motion to condemn and censure Adam Schiff. he must be held accountable for misleading the American people. 173 Members of Congress have cosponsored this motion.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump weighed in with this: \u201cCensure (at least) Corrupt Adam Schiff! After what he got caught doing, any pol who does not so vote cannot be honest \u2026 are you listening Dems?\u201d\n\nSchiff has been under fire, mostly by Republicans, for his handling of the \u201cimpeachment Inquiry\u201d \u2014 a term the Democrats adopted as a means of keeping alive the dreaded anti-Trump \u201cI-word\u201d in the media, without having to take yet another formal vote on impeachment. \u2018Cause they know such a vote would fail. \u2018Cause it already has.\n\nAnyway: Schiff has been one of the loudest, most vicious callers of impeachment \u2014 besting even Rep. Maxine Waters, if you can believe it. One of Schiff\u2019s most widely panned shenanigans? He put on a parody performance of Trump telephone conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that featured a massive White House quid pro quo \u2014 without bothering to mentioning, for the record, oh, yes, this is all fun and parody games.\n\nIn other words: He parodied for the purpose of inflicting political damage, while maintaining plausible deniability. Busted, congressman.\n\nBiggs, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said in a recent interview on Fox News that yes, his censure motion is going forward; that yes, Republicans would be holding several private meetings in coming days to root out the \u201cStalinesque, Soviet-style\u201d impeachment crap; and that yes, the intelligence community would be under scrutiny.\n\nWhat\u2019s the purpose of a Republican-pressed censure vote on a Democratic member of the House in a Democratic-controlled atmosphere?\n\nIt\u2019s symbolic, true.\n\nBut it\u2019s also educational.\n\nIt\u2019s also revealing.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that the American people understand what Adam Schiff is doing is not the normal way you conduct an impeachment inquiry,\u201d Biggs said. \u201cI would say it gives the Democrats an opportunity to show the American people where they are on due process.\u201d\n\nJust in case we missed that whole Brett Kavanaugh thing, right?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s filled with a lot of symbolism, but it\u2019s also got the harsh reality of it as well,\u201d Biggs said.\n\nMaybe.\n\nBut the harsh reality of American politics is this: Schiff probably isn\u2019t going to be censured. In a House controlled by Pelosi \u2014 it just isn\u2019t going to happen.\n\nStill, the vote is necessary if only to show even more clearly the political battlefields on Capitol Hill: On one side, the moral; the other, the immoral. No doubt, the vote will fall utterly on partisan political sides, as well. And with election season upon us, Americans can sure use the clarity.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
