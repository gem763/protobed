Absolutely. No question about that. But that\u2019s it. And that\u2019s why we held up the money. . . . The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate.\n\nEvery member of the U.S. House and Senate knows that this is not done all the time, and that a quid pro quo to further a president\u2019s political interests is verboten. Trump and his cronies are making it increasingly difficult for Republicans to find a reason not to vote for impeachment and removal. Compulsive confessions are a major stumbling block to retaining the loyalty of congressional Republicans.\n\nSecond, as if one confession were not enough, the ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, reportedly told the House impeachment panel \u201cthat President Trump outsourced the job of handling U.S. policy on Ukraine to Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, a decision that made Sondland uncomfortable but one he still carried out.\u201d He further claimed at the time to have been in the dark about Giuliani\u2019s role in scrounging for dirt on former vice president Joe Biden, a questionable defense, given Giuliani\u2019s many public statements boasting that this was precisely what he was doing. The evidence of a quid pro quo is piling up, giving Republicans one more reason to jump ship on Trump.\n\nFinally, in an unprecedented display of chutzpah, Trump announced that next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit would be held at his Doral golf resort near Miami, one of the clearest instances yet of self-enrichment and unconstitutional receipt of emoluments. The emoluments controversy had receded in light of the Ukraine scandal, but such a blatant example of Trump\u2019s willingness to smash government and reap personal financial benefits weighs heavily in favor of removing him. We\u2019d better get him out of there before he makes off with any more loot. The urgency of his removal is intensified when he displays an ever-increasing appetite for unethical, unconstitutional and illegal conduct, about which his aides tell us to \u201cget over it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) seemed to recognize the gravity of Mulvaney\u2019s confession. \u201cMr. Mulvaney\u2019s acknowledgment means that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse,\u201d he said.\n\nA steady stream of witnesses continue to testify in the impeachment inquiry, increasing the volume of evidence of what is already an air-tight case. At some point House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will need to decide that there is enough evidence to convince most persuadable voters of goodwill that Trump\u2019s continued presence in the Oval Office is a danger to the republic. Frankly, that might be any day now.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Three major developments may move the dial on impeachment.", "authors": ["Jennifer Rubin", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Policy", "Foreign", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ge13m2S144_9YSmluyJe4F1Q2Qs=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-17-2019/t_722a2991a6ed4d9db043b43e74271745_name_a723583c_f105_11e9_bb7e_d2026ee0c199.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
