The OG American Idol\u2019s brand-new daytime talk show, The Kelly Clarkson Show, radiates joy from your screen like vitamin D from the sun. Even though the most of a daytime TV show I\u2019ve seen in the past year is this clip from The Ellen Show where she asks her \u201chunks\u201d trivia questions, I am officially stanning The Kelly Clarkson Show. Every episode kicks off with a different \u201cKellyoke,\u201d where she covers a popular song. For instance, the premiere had Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201c9 to 5,\u201d complete with a montage of Kelly working in different professions and a Steve Carell introduction. The second episode featured \u201cBad Romance\u201d by Lady Gaga in a cover that would be unrecognizable if it wasn\u2019t such an iconic song. Kelly\u2019s stripped back version ditches the (again, iconic, don\u2019t come for me, stans!) synth pop and transforms it into a 1980s headbanger. Simply put: It rocks. Kellyoke rocks. If we don\u2019t get a Kellyoke soundtrack eventually, NBC will be hearing from me and my lawyers. More Kellyoke, straight into my bloodstream, please!\n\nRelated", "description": "Watch Kelly Clarkson cover Lady Gaga\u2019s song \u201cBad Romance,\u201d on her new daytime talk show, \u2018The Kelly Clarkson Show.\u2019", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/11-kelly-clarkson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
