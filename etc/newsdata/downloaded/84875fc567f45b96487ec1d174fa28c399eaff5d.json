The government had already begun the construction of a mausoleum at the National Heroes Acre after Mugabe was declared a national hero.\n\nBut the Mugabe family seized the funeral programme and took his body for burial in Zvimba. The government had insisted on a hilltop burial. Mugabe\u2019s family said the late former leader had instructed his wife to bury his remains in Zvimba. The family said Mugabe had been humiliated during the November 2017 coup that ended his 37-year rule.\n\nOn Thursday, Mugabe\u2019s family took over funeral arrangements and took the body for burial in Zvimba. Family members who spoke during the final funeral service before burial said it was Mugabe\u2019s wish to be buried at his rural home.\n\n\u201cI spoke to him personally as to why he would not want to be buried at the national hero\u2019s acre, he said to me \u2018I was humiliated\u2019.

What has happened here was [Mugabe\u2019s] wish. When we had discussions the burial issue was non-negotiable. We want to say thank you to president Emmerson Mnangagwa for respecting his wishes . \u201d\n\nMnangagwa and Zanu PF stalwarts did not attend the burial ceremony.\n\nMugabe had been in Singapore for four months. He reportedly succumbed to cancer. Zanu PF released a statement on Saturday expressing dismay at the family\u2019s decision to bury Mugabe at his rural home while the state was preparing a mausoleum at the hilltop National Heroes Acre.\n\n\u201cThe revelation that former president Robert Mugabe who passed on 6 September will have a private burial at his rural home in Zvimba is most unfortunate,\u201d the party spokesperson, Simon Khaya Moyo said.\n\nA funeral mass was held before the burial while students from Mugabe\u2019s former school, Kutama College, sung hymns in honour of their former patron.
