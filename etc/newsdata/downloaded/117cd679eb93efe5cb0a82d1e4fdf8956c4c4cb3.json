[nL5N25Z0IX]\n\nNO-DEAL BREXIT BLOCK\n\nJohnson and other senior ministers say they are coming up with new proposals and that progress is being made in talks.\n\nFinance minister Sajid Javid said Johnson would go to an EU summit on Oct. 17 to try to secure that deal.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister will go to the council meeting on the 17th and 18th (of October), he\u2019ll be trying to strike a deal. He absolutely will not be asking for an extension in that meeting,\u201d Javid told the BBC.\n\nOne of the main sticking points has been disagreement over the Irish \u2018backstop\u2019 - an insurance policy to prevent the return of visible checks on the border between the Irish Republic and the British province of Northern Ireland.\n\nJohnson goes to Dublin on Monday for talks with his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar, but expectations are low.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the meeting tomorrow is a high-stakes meeting in that I don\u2019t anticipate a big breakthrough,\u201d Varadkar said on Sunday. \u201cIf we come to an agreement, that will happen most likely in October at the EU summit.\u201d\n\nThe bill requiring Johnson to seek a Brexit extension is due to become law on Monday when it receives the assent of Queen Elizabeth, a move Johnson said would destroy Britain\u2019s negotiating strategy by removing the threat of a \u2018no-deal\u2019 exit.\n\nForeign minister Dominic Raab said the government would \u201ctest to the limit\u201d what the law would require ministers to do, and the Daily Telegraph reported that his office was exploring how it could sabotage any extension request by making it clear to the EU that it did not want a delay.\n\nIrish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told BBC radio: \u201cI think it would be reasonable to say that, from our point of view, we would be in favour of an extension that would create the space to hopefully conclude where we are. But it is a matter that needs full agreement across the European Council.\u201d", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will try for a second time on Monday to call a snap election, but is set to be thwarted once more by opposition lawmakers who want to ensure he cannot take Britain out of the European Union without a divorce agreement.", "authors": ["Michael Holden", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427876193&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880OA", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
