That was, until she launched her own online investigation to find it, and a local IT salesperson-turned Good Samaritan swooped in to help her track it down.\n\n\u201cI lose things all the time, and I\u2019ve gotten very, very good at finding them again,\u201d Sproul-Latimer said told \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nAre you ready for a story that has single-handedly restored my faith in humanity, ending in a shameless plug for this local IT business owner, Imran Moorad of Dotsight Solutions, everybody please hire him? pic.twitter.com/2WqGL2wb6y\n\n\u2014 Anna Sproul-Latimer (@annasproul) October 8, 2019\n\nThe literary agent from Arlington, Virginia, didn\u2019t realize until she got home that she had left her laptop on the Amtrak train ride from New York City to D.C. Knowing the drill on lost electronics, she said she used the Find My iPhone app and located her laptop in Woodbridge, Virginia.\n\nAt first, Sproul-Latimer said she assumed that her cab driver had found her laptop in the backseat and taken it home with him for safe-keeping. When she called the cab company, however, they told her the employee did not live in Woodbridge.\n\nThen she called Amtrak and was told that it was against their company policy to take lost items off property. She realized her laptop was likely stolen.\n\n\"I began to get depressed and panicked and sad when I realized that whoever had [my laptop] \u2026 was a bad actor,\" Sproul-Latimer said.\n\nStill determined, she left messages on her computer through Find My iPhone -- at first polite messages requesting help and then later messages of righteous anger demanding its return.\n\nBefore anyone could wipe the laptop and take it off the grid, she said she memorized its last listed location -- a nice residential area in Woodbridge.\n\n\u201cI lost momentum, and I was like, who am I kidding? This is never going to work out,\u201d Sproul-Latimer said.\n\nShe tried calling the police in her area, but there wasn't much that could be done since the laptop went missing in a state outside of the police's jurisdiction. They told her that the most they could do is accompany her to the last listed location -- a prospect that even with a police escort could prove dangerous.\n\n\u201cThis is a MacBook Pro. My life is worth at least two MacBook Pros,\u201d Sproul-Latimer joked.\n\nIn the meantime, she bought a new laptop, but hadn\u2019t given up her search. She went to Google Earth and mapped the last location. Online, she found contact information for a couple who lived in the neighborhood. She took a chance and emailed them informing them of her hunt for her missing laptop. Then, she waited. She never heard back.\n\nThe neighbors received her emails, but instead of answering, instead consulted with their tech-savvy neighbor -- the founder of a computer repair and buy back company, DotSight Solutions -- to help them.\n\nCoincidentally, the neighbor, Imran Moorad, had just returned from the Apple Store repairing a used computer he had purchased. When he heard about Sproul-Latimer\u2019s story, he put two and two together.\n\nAlthough Moorad said his company double checks every person they buy laptops from, he did some digging of his own and found that one of the serial numbers of the computers he\u2019d done buybacks for in the last few weeks matched Sproul-Latimer's.\n\n\u201cShe was ecstatic over the phone,\u201d Moorad said.\n\n\u201c \u201d He chose to do the good thing, and I think that\u2019s something that all of us can do.\n\nMoorad and Sproul-Latimer met up soon after at a Starbucks in Alexandria. Though Moorad had spent $600 on the laptop purchase, not to mention recent upgrades, he gave it back to her, no charge.\n\n\u201cShe offered me money for it,\" he said. \"And I was like, 'I can\u2019t take money from you because this belongs to you.'\"\n\nSproul-Latimer said that she started to cry because she was touched not only by Moorad\u2019s generosity but also by his \u201cmeaningful\u201d choice to help her even though he had no reason to -- just because it was the \u201cright thing\u201d to do.\n\nAnna Sproul-Latimer\n\n\u201cThat was the nicest thing someone has done for me in years and years,\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe chose to do the good thing, and I think that\u2019s something that all of us can do. But it\u2019s something hard to do.\"\n\nI\u2019m sitting in my car weeping now, because it\u2019s so important to remember that most people in the world are kind. They are aching to help. This story started in one of the darker moments of my adult life so far, and look where it ended. Imran, thank you. \u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Anna Sproul-Latimer (@annasproul) October 8, 2019\n\nSproul-Latimer took to Twitter to share the story of Moorad's act of kindness that \"single-handedly restored (her) faith in humanity.\"\n\nIn complete disbelief at the level of support from the community for something that I didn't think was a big deal. Simply getting @annasproul her MacBook back was my good deed for the day, but I'm even more honored that my good deed touched so many people. Thank you everyone \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f https://t.co/xIS09QaJpU \u2014 DotSight Solutions (@DotSightS) October 8, 2019\n\nMoorad said he never considered keeping the laptop because he values honesty -- not to mention her dogged pursuit to find it.\n\n\u201cI was really happy to see that she was happy,\u201d Moorad said. \u201cWhen we start putting money over people\u2019s feelings, that\u2019s when things start going south.\"\n\nHe added that he has been \u201cblown away\u201d by her appreciation and the positive buzz online. To Moorad, even though he lost $600, Sproul-Latimer\u2019s happiness and appreciation made it all worth it.\n\n\u201cAny act of kindness goes such a long way. You just don\u2019t know what the person on the receiving end is going through,\u201d Moorad said.", "description": "It\u2019s every laptop owner\u2019s worst nightmare.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/lost-laptop-ht-jef-191011_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
