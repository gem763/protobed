Now Tariffs.", "language": "en", "text": "The United States was allowed to apply the tariffs, expected to go into force on Friday , after a World Trade Organization ruling settled a yearslong dispute over subsidies for the aviation company Airbus. They create a double whammy for Scotland.\n\nWhisky underpins the economy of Islay (pronounced EYE-la) and much of Scotland. Kilchoman and eight rival Scotch whisky distilleries have flourished here in the past decade. Tourists from the United States, Europe and Japan come to wonder at Islay\u2019s coastal beauty, take pictures of hillsides filled with sheep and hairy Highland cattle that look as if they\u2019ve had vigorous blow dries, and soak up the pricey local spirits.\n\nAnnual exports of Scotch whisky are worth 4.7 billion pounds, or about $5.9 billion, accounting for 70 percent of Scotland\u2019s food and drink exports and 21 percent of Britain\u2019s.\n\nMore than \u00a31 billion worth of the strong stuff goes to the United States. Almost \u00a31.4 billion is sold in the European Union.", "description": "The 25 percent U.S. tariffs to be imposed Friday are causing headaches for single malt distilleries, already struggling with Brexit.", "authors": ["Amie Tsang"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/business/17whiskytariffs-1/17whiskytariffs-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
