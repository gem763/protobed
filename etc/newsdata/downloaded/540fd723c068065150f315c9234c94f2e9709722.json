Other runs will happen in the next few days as I try to get back to the good running days.\n\nHowever, the thought of missing out on the Soweto Marathon has become a recurring one.\n\nMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have given up my entry so quickly. Maybe I should have continued exercising instead of giving in.\n\nBut the milk has already been spilt and there is no way I can run the People\u2019s Race this year.\n\nI can only wait for next year\u2019s edition, and while I wait and start all over again, what I am learning is that running is a serious addiction which has no known cure.\n\nTemporary wounds aren\u2019t enough to put the mind off the sport.\n\nIn the meantime, I plan to be at FNB Stadium to watch fellow runners conquer this monster.", "description": "In mid-September, I stepped on a nail with my right foot while removing the ceiling of my house.", "authors": ["Dumisane Lubisi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8479/00634ef6cf7c4b829136c4e16f41d3f2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
