Thinking she was in her own apartment, she shot and killed Jean, a 26-year-old black man, who had been sitting on his couch and eating ice cream. She was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\n\u201cIf you truly are sorry \u2014 I know I can speak for myself \u2014 I, I forgive you,\u201d Brandt Jean told Guyger during a sentencing hearing. \u201cAnd I know if you go to God and ask Him, He will forgive you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you just like anyone else,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say I hope you rot and die, just like my brother did. \u2026 I personally want the best for you.\u201d\n\nJean then turned to Judge Tammy Kemp. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is possible, but can I give her a hug, please,\u201d he asked. \u201cPlease?\u201d\n\nThe judge said yes and Jean stepped down from the witness stand and wrapped Guyger in his arms. Both sobbed.\n\nWe are not so naive to suggest that we can all be as forgiving and understanding as Jean. We suspect that a significant number of internet denizens who watched the video and gushed about how uplifting it was were, minutes later, back at their keyboards mocking \u201ctheir opponents.\u201d Yet, we should take a lesson from his extraordinary action, which has been shared by media around the world.\n\nThere is much more that unites us in our shared human experience than divides us. We are all human, no matter our race and ethnicity, our religion, our sexual orientation or party affiliation.\n\nWe live in a time when building walls \u2014 metaphorical and real \u2014 is a too common response to our misperceptions, our misunderstandings and our fears. Denigrating and fighting against those who cast a ballot for a different candidate, who came from a different country, or who worship a different god (or none at all) is wearing us down.\n\nJean reminds us that we have a different choice \u2014 we can choose forgiveness and understanding, despite what feels like a chasm between us.\n\nWe are all striving for a better life for ourselves and our family. For some, the path is straight and easy. For many, there are hardships that require assistance and understanding. Some make horrific mistakes. But, as Brandt Jean so eloquently voiced, we should all want what is best for one another \u2014 even if we have different ideas of what that means.\n\nWhen we condemn one another for how we look, how much money we make, what we value, where we come from, how we drive, who we love, where we shop and many other small differences, we throw up unnecessary roadblocks to our wellbeing as a nation, and a planet.\n\nThere was another popular video on social media this week. It showed an out-of-control catering cart circling perilously close to an airplane parked at a gate at O\u2019Hare airport in Chicago, spilling its cargo and scattering airport workers. Many joked that the chaos symbolized the current state of American affairs.\n\nBut there is a deeper question raised by the video. Who are we? Are we the circle of people mostly standing by, wondering what to do? Or are we the person who acts, using a ramp truck to stop the runaway cart, ending the chaos and danger?", "description": "\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t have been an extraordinary request, except that the woman Brandt Jean wanted to hug had the day before been convicted of murdering his brother, Botham Jean..
