And if people like it and resonate with it, then that\u2019s a bonus. But this felt so good, to just like let it out and be me.\u201d\n\nOver the last several years, Hough, 31, said she became more comfortable sharing who she is with people.\n\nJulianne Hough | Steven Taylor More\n\nRELATED: Julianne Hough Debuts First New Song in Nearly a Decade During America\u2019s Got Talent Finale\n\n\u201cI love being 31,\u201d she said. \u201cI have never felt more like a woman in my life, and I\u2019ve always been the girl next door, all-American sweetheart. And that\u2019s a version and a part of me, but it\u2019s not all of who I am, and I didn\u2019t even know that about me. So the last few years have been about me picking up all parts of who I am and the parts that I\u2019ve suppressed over probably 25 years.\u201d\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t easy for Hough to finally show herself to the world, she said it was \u201cso liberating to come out the other side and know that like, this is who I am and I\u2019m so freaking proud of who I am.\u201d\n\nIn Women\u2019s Health September cover story, Hough admitted that as she was undergoing a personal evolution, she was fearful that her husband, an NHL player and entrepreneur, wouldn\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201cI was connecting to the woman inside that doesn\u2019t need anything, versus the little girl that looked to him to protect me,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Is he going to love this version of me?\u2019 But the more I dropped into my most authentic self, the more attracted he was to me.\u201d\n\nJulianne Hough and Brooks Laich | Michael Tran/Getty More\n\nRELATED: Julianne Hough Doesn\u2019t Actually Like When Brooks Laich Sucks on Her Toes: \u2018Let Me Clear That Up\u2019\n\nAs a result, Hough said they now \u201chave a more intimate relationship.\u201d\n\nBecoming more emotionally and physically intimate allowed Hough to be open with her husband about her sexuality \u2014 and reveal that she isn\u2019t straight.\n\n\u201cI [told him], \u2018You know I\u2019m not straight, right?\u2019 And he was like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry what?\u2019\u201d explained the pro dancer, who created a new dance concept called Kinrgy. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m not.
