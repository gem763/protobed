They put it into their sizer. I flew to Aberdeen with the bag, everything was fine.\n\n\u201cFour days later I was returning and stopped at the gate at Aberdeen airport - and I suppose one of the most crucial differences is not by Flybe staff - but by ground staff at Aberdeen airport using a sizer which wasn\u2019t identified as a Flybe sizer.\n\n\u201cThey determined that the bag wasn\u2019t complaint and to get on the flight, I had to pay them \u00a350. Let\u2019s just say I was not happy, particularly as the bag still had the compliance sticker from the flight from four days earlier.\u201d\n\nAfter a phone call to Flybe\u2019s Exeter office and 10 emails without resolution, Mr Gormley decided to take the airline to the small claims court as he felt that whatever his narrative the airline just gave \u201canother reason to reject it\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe whole charge is arbitrary, it\u2019s inconsistent, it\u2019s open to personal interpretation and more than anything it\u2019s penal - \u00a350 to take a bag!\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe overriding issue is that the starting position for all these organisations is to say \u2018no\u2019 and keep saying \u2018no\u2019 because they do probably work on the basis that you are just going to go away.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t, and after paying \u00a337 to go to the small claims court \u201cwhich is a very straight forward process\u201d he went to court, where he disputed the claim he \u201cjust got lucky\u201d with his bag on the other flights.\n\nLuckily for him the judge agreed.\n\n\u201cMy objection is not that they have a policy about the size of their bags, my objection is the application of how it is interpreted... and is open to mistakes. I don\u2019t accept that I got lucky - the people in Aberdeen got it wrong,\u201d he added.\n\nThe judge ruled in Declan\u2019s favour and Flybe were told to pay back his \u00a350 plus his \u00a337 court fee.\n\nNow he hopes the case will make the airline think about their baggage policy as \u201cit is clearly not being applied in a fair manner\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for the airline said: \u201cFlybe can confirm that it has received and is complying with the NI court and tribunal service ruling dated 10 Oct 2019.\n\n\u201cThe airline continues to have a generous hand baggage allowance, which since 2016, allows passengers to take on board 2 pieces of cabin baggage. This includes 1 item that does not exceed 55 x 35 x 20cm, and one smaller additional piece such as a handbag or laptop case. Any hand baggage which exceeds these stated dimensions is charged as highlighted to customers during the booking process and again in all pre-flight communications. All information can be found on Flybe website .\n\n\u201cFlybe works closely with its ground handling team to regularly check that its hand baggage policy is being properly and consistently adhered to and applied.\u201d", "description": "Declan Gormley took the airline to the small claims court over the baggage charge on his return flight from Aberdeen to Belfast", "authors": ["Shauna Corr", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20753057.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Flybe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
