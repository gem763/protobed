(Earthlings, that is)", "language": "en", "text": "HIKO, Nev. \u2014 The stage was set Thursday for music and other space-themed entertainment as Earthlings descended on the Nevada desert for events inspired by an internet hoax known as \u201cStorm Area 51.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt started as a joke, but it\u2019s not a joke for us,\u201d Alon Burton, guitarist and member of the group Wily Savage, said as he and several other men wrestled a tarp over a makeshift stage near the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn motel and cafe in Rachel.\n\nGusts of wind billowed the white canopy like a sailboat spinnaker as they tied it down.\n\n\u201cWe know people will come out. We just don\u2019t know how many,\u201d he said.\n\nBy early afternoon, several hundred people had made their way to the site where secrecy surrounding Area 51 has long fueled speculation that it\u2019s where the government studies space aliens.\n\nAs they arrived for the weekend events, campers in trucks and trailers staked out space on federal land across a highway.\n\nAnticipating a big crowd, a beer company had produced alien-themed cans, and a brothel in offered discounts to \u201cE.T. enthusiasts.\u201d\n\nEvents were planned in Rachel and Hiko, a 45-minute drive away, the two towns closest to Area 51.\n\nThe festivities sparked by the internet joke inviting people to \u201csee them aliens\u201d could become a cultural marker, monumental dud or something in between.\n\n\u201cThis phenomenon is really a perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies, and the desire to know what we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Michael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity.\n\nThe result, Borer said, was \u201chope and fear\u201d for events that include the \u201cArea 51 Basecamp,\u201d featuring music, speakers and movies in Hiko and festivals in Rachel and Las Vegas competing for the name \u201cAlienstock.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve,\u201d Borer said. \u201cArea 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can\u2019t go. When you tell people they can\u2019t do something, they just want to do it more.\u201d\n\nEric Holt, the Lincoln County emergency manager overseeing preparations, said he believed authorities could handle 30,000 visitors at the events in Rachel and Hiko.\n\nStill, neighbors braced for trouble after millions of people responded to the \u201cStorm Area 51\u201d Facebook post weeks ago.\n\nJoerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who can see the festival grounds from his home, said he installed outdoor floodlights, fencing and \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs on his 30-acre property.\n\nHe also organized a radio-equipped night watch of neighbors who fear there won\u2019t be enough water, food, trash bins or toilets for visitors.\n\n\u201cThose that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,\u201d Arnu said.\n\nHowever, others won\u2019t if they show up in shorts and flip-flops, he said.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t protect you against critters, snakes and scorpions,\u201d Arnu said. \u201cIt will get cold at night. They\u2019re not going to find what they\u2019re looking for, and they are going to get angry.\u201d\n\nSome cellphones didn\u2019t work Thursday in Rachel, and officials expect what service there was to eventually be overwhelmed.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration closed nearby air space, although Air Force jets could be heard in the sun-drenched skies, along with an occasional sonic boom.\n\nGeorge Harris, owner of the Alien Research Center souvenir store in Hiko, said the \u201cArea 51 Basecamp\u201d Friday and Saturday will focus on music, movies and talks about extraterrestrial lore.\n\nElectronic dance music DJ and recording artist Paul Oakenfold is Friday\u2019s headliner in Hiko.\n\nThe event also promises up to 60 food trucks and vendors, trash and electric service, and a robust security and medical staff.\n\nHarris said he was prepared for as many as 15,000 people and expected they would appreciate taking selfies with a replica of the Area 51 back gate without having to travel several miles to the real thing.\n\n\u201cWe just want people to be safe,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAs long as they don\u2019t go on the desert floor and destroy the ecosystem, everyone will have a good time.\u201d\n\nBurton said he had promises from almost 50 performers to appear at the Rachel site, off a state road dubbed Extraterrestrial Highway.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force has issued stern warnings for people not to approach the gates of the Nevada Test and Training Range, where Area 51 is located.\n\nAuthorities in Nye County, home to a conspicuously green establishment called the Area 51 Alien Center, are discouraging Earthlings from trying to find extraterrestrials.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking precautions and checking the back roads,\u201d Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said.\n\nHer deputies last week arrested two Dutch tourists attracted by \u201cStorm Area 51.\u201d The men pleaded guilty to trespassing at a secure U.S. site nowhere near Area 51 and promised to pay thousands in fines.\n\nArnu said the military added razor wire to barbed cattle fencing on the Area 51 boundary near his home, installed more cameras and battery-powered lighting, and erected an imposing spike barrier just inside a gate. He noted a new sign telling trespassers they\u2019ll be arrested and fined $1,000.", "description": "The stage was set Thursday for music and other space-themed entertainment as Earthlings descended on the Nevada desert for events inspired by an internet...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR701_area51_ZG_20190919233220.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
