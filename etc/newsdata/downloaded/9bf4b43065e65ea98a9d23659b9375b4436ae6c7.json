Rashida Tlaib. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images Congress Ethics panel reviews campaign payments to Rashida Tlaib\n\nThe House Ethics Committee is reviewing a potential campaign finance violation by Rep. Rashida Tlaib during her 2018 campaign, her office confirmed Monday.\n\nThe Office of Congressional Ethics has recommended an investigation into claims that Tlaib reimbursed herself from her campaign fund after the 2018 election, when she was no longer a candidate. Tlaib\u2019s office denied any misuse of funds, stating that the Michigan freshman \u201cfully complied with the law and acted in good faith at all times.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile candidates are allowed to pay themselves a salary during the campaign, Tlaib reported a salary of $17,500 in two payments after the Nov. 6 election, according to her disclosure. The payments were dated Nov. 16 and Dec. 1.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission states that salary payments may continue \u201cuntil the date of the general election.\u201d\n\nTlaib\u2019s salary payments were first reported by the conservative Washington Free Beacon.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

That initial step, however, does not mean a violation occurred.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee now faces a 45-day deadline to announce whether to go ahead with a full investigation, or once again extend the review period and release the OCE report.\n\nJohn Bresnahan contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "Tlaib\u2019s office denied any misuse of funds.", "authors": ["Sarah Ferris"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c1/76/a18aa39b4c1d8e9be793e2a8fc31/20190930-tlaib-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
