Repairs were expected to finish this Friday.\n\nThe bacteria that can cause Legionnaires\u2019 disease was found in the system during a routine test last month. About 700 staffers and 273 patients at the District-owned facility have since relied on bottled water and running water substitutes such as wipes and portable showers. The lack of potable water also means the hospital\u2019s food service is being outsourced.\n\nOfficials say no one has shown any symptoms related to the bacteria first reported on by the Washington City Paper.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Officials say a public psychiatric hospital in the nation's capital may go another week without drinking water.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
