The party decided earlier this year that no disciplinary action was necessary, prompting the woman to tell her story to the media. Since then, Labour Party President Nigel Haworth and the man at the center of the allegations, who worked in parliament and hasn\u2019t been identified, have both resigned.\n\n\u201cThere are no excuses for the handling of the complaints by the Labour Party, and I will offer none,\u201d Ardern said at a post-cabinet press conference in Wellington on Monday, a week after the sexual assault allegation was detailed by website The Spinoff. \u201cWe have a duty of care, and we failed in it.\u201d\n\nA year out from a general election, the scandal has the potential to undermine support for Labour and Ardern, whose popularity has much to do with her image as a caring leader and champion of the disadvantaged, including women in the workplace. Questions are being asked not only about the culture of the Labour Party, which mishandled a separate sexual assault allegation last year, but also whether Ardern knew about the allegations sooner than she says she did.\n\nThe Labour Party looked into multiple complaints against the man from several people, including harassment and bullying, but Ardern says she was not aware of the sexual assault claim until The Spinoff article.\n\nWhile Haworth said the woman\u2019s complaint about the man didn\u2019t include the allegation of sexual assault, she insists it did. A lawyer is currently conducting an appeal process, and Ardern said today that an independent third party would review Labour\u2019s handling of the allegations. Ardern has also agreed to meet with the complainants.\n\n\u201cWhile the party has continued to maintain that they weren\u2019t in receipt of the complaints that have since been published in the media, that is secondary to the fact that the complaints made to the party were of significant concern and needed to be heard in a timely way,\u201d she said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Matthew Brockett in Wellington at mbrockett1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Matthew Brockett at mbrockett1@bloomberg.net, Edward Johnson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s leadership is under scrutiny after her Labour Party botched its handling of an alleged sexual assault on a 19-year-old party volunteer.Ardern has been forced to apologize to the woman and take control of an investigation into the allegations,", "authors": ["Matthew Brockett"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/I.iF2IqXZlFZvLATZWhB3g--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/1d02d8c7033b9b4b60ee5b457c98a504", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
