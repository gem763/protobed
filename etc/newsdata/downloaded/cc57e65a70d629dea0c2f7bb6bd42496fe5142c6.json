All time can now be split into BC (before Coleen) and AD (after drama).\n\nBut it seems like footballer Jamie, who currently plays for Leicester City, is less than impressed by Coleen\u2019s decision to publicly accuse his wife of three years of wrongdoing \u2013 which she denies \u2013 and wants nothing more to do with the Rooney clan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresentatives for Vardy have denied these claims.\n\nA source close to Jamie reportedly told The Sun (ironically): \u2018[Jamie] is totally behind Becky and furious with the Rooneys for the way they have gone about this.\n\nOnline commenters named the scandal \u2018Wag-ileaks\u2019 and nicknamed Coleen \u2018Wagatha Christie\u2019 (Picture: Jean Catuffe/Getty)\n\n\u2018He and Wayne always got on well and he likes him. But he has made his feelings clear. Cutting him off on social media is a totally deliberate snub.\u2019\n\nThey continued: \u2018He won\u2019t stand for having his wife hung out to dry in public like this.\u2019\n\nWhile the story has undeniably been the cause of much hilarity (and endless memes), the accusations have negatively impacted life for Rebekah, with the mum-of-four even being visited by the police after receiving receiving graphic death threats from online trolls.\n\nThe 37-year-old, who is seven months pregnant with her fifth child, took to Instagram on Wednesday evening to share some of the disgusting messages she had received, with one reading: \u2018F**k you dirty sly c*** I hope that baby dies within you b***h.\u2019\n\nIn response, Rebekah simply wrote: \u2018Well played.\u2019\n\nNo matter your team, Coleen or Rebekah, there\u2019s never any need for that.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
