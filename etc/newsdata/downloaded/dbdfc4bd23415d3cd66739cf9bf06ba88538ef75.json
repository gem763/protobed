How did we get there?\u201d\n\nAfter noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.\n\n\u201cThe problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,\u201d he declared.\n\nAs Carlson nodded and said \u201cthat\u2019s true,\u201d Rubin continued, complaining that this isn\u2019t how \u201cfreedom is supposed to operate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is supposed to happen\u2014imagine if your house was on fire,\u201d he added. \u201cWould you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It\u2019s just absolutely ridiculous.\u201d\n\nThe Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E\u2019s preemptive blackouts to a lack of \u201clibertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t keep the lights on and you can\u2019t keep the place from burning down, you\u2019ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,\u201d Carlson concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s falling apart. It\u2019s a disaster. It\u2019s not civilized anymore.\u201d", "description": "\u201cThe problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke... eventually breaks down.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572405375/tucker-carlson-tonight_-_2019-10-29T221010.971_n2gntk", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
