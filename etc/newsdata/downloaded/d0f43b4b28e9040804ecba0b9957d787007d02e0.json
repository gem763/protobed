He was 86.\n\nKonr\u00e1d's family said he had been ill, but gave no specifics.\n\nKnown internationally for books like his 1969 novel The Case Worker and his 2007 memoir A Guest in My Own Country: A Hungarian Life, Konr\u00e1d was considered a steadfast advocate for individual freedoms. He was president of the writers' association PEN International from 1990 to 1993 and president of the Academy of Arts in Berlin from 1997 to 2003.\n\nAfter the communist regime lifted a publication ban on him, Konr\u00e1d described himself in a 1990 piece: \"A 57-year-old novelist and essayist. Hungarian in language and citizenship. Of the Jewish faith. The father of four children from two marriages. Wardrobe rather modest, but does own several typewriters.\" He later had a fifth child, born in 1994.\n\nBorn to a prosperous Jewish family on April 2, 1933, in Debrecen, eastern Hungary, Konr\u00e1d and his immediate family survived the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of numerous relatives. He spent his childhood in Berettyoujfalu, near Debrecen, until his parents were deported to Austria in 1944.\n\nAllowed to visit relatives in Budapest, Konr\u00e1d and his sister Eva, along with two cousins, survived by finding refuge in a safe house under Swiss protection. A day after their departure from Berettyoujfal, the remaining Jewish residents of the town were deported and nearly all killed in Nazi death camps.\n\nIn Budapest, he studied at the Department of Hungarian at Eotvos Lorant University and finished his studies in 1956 despite being expelled twice. As punishment for his role in the aborted anti-Soviet uprising in 1956, he lost his job and was unemployed from 1957 through 1959. He had joined the National Guard during the uprising, but, as he wrote, \"never used my gun, only took it for walks.\"\n\nIn the early 1960s, Konr\u00e1d got work as an editor at a literary monthly, then between 1965 and 1973 switched to social work and wrote studies on urban sociology.\n\nHis first novel, The Case Worker, was inspired by his job as a children's welfare officer. The book described the lives of the poor in a working-class district, painting a picture in stark contrast with the official line about the \"happy workers building socialism.\"\n\nThe novel, published in 6,000 copies, sold out in days. A second edition was not allowed until after the collapse of communism in 1989.\n\nKonr\u00e1d was blacklisted almost permanently between 1973 and 1988 and many of his works were first published abroad.\n\nThe essay-like The City Builder, a perspective of totalitarianism through the experiences of an architect, was banned for political reasons in 1973, though a heavily edited version appeared in 1977.\n\nAlong with friend Ivan Szelenyi, Konr\u00e1d wrote The Road of Intellectuals to Class Power, but the manuscript was confiscated by the secret police in 1978 because it dared to contradict the party notion that workers constituted the ruling class.\n\nKonr\u00e1d and Szelenyi were both arrested and held for a week. They were given the option to emigrate and Szelenyi left. Konr\u00e1d by then had thrown in his lot with the dissident movement, the democratic underground, and opted to stay, publishing his books in the alternative \u2014 and illegal \u2014 \"samizdat\" press.\n\nHis work was rewarded with the prestigious Herder Award, conferred by German and Austrian universities, in 1983, an event not announced in Hungary at the time.\n\nDuring his stint as president of Berlin's Academy of Arts after the fall of communism, Konr\u00e1d worked to promote writers and artists from Eastern Europe. He also received high state awards from Hungary, France and Germany as well as numerous prizes in recognition for his literary and human rights activities.\n\nKonr\u00e1d is survived by his wife, Judit Lakner, and his children.\n\nKonr\u00e1d spoke to Eleanor Wachtel on Writers & Company in 2005. You can listen to their conversation below:\n\nThe celebrated Hungarian author, known for books such as \"The Case Worker\" and \"A Guest in My Own Country,\" spoke to Eleanor Wachtel in May 2005.
