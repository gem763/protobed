UPDATE 2-Algeria launches tender to buy milling wheat\n\n(Confirms offer deadline)\n\nHAMBURG, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Algeria's state grains agency OAIC has issued an international tender to buy milling wheat to be sourced from optional origins, European traders said on Monday.\n\nThe tender sought a nominal 50,000 tonnes, but Algeria often buys considerably more in its tenders than the nominal volume sought.\n\nThe tender deadline is Tuesday, Oct. 22, with offers having to remain valid until Wednesday, Oct. 23, traders said.\n\nThe wheat was sought for shipment in two periods, Dec. 1-15 and Dec. 16-31. If sourced from South Africa, shipment is between Nov. 1-15 and Nov. 16-30.\n\nIn its last reported tender on Sept. 18, OAIC bought up to 600,000 tonnes of wheat for shipment in Nov. 1-15 and Nov. 16-30, after Algeria caused concern among wheat exporters by apparently skipping October imports.", "description": "UPDATE 2-Algeria launches tender to buy milling wheat", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEABN09S_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
