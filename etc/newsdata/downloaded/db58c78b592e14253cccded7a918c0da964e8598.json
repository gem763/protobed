Courtesy of the Dunn Family\n\nSacoolas, who is married to an American diplomat assigned to the U.K. and is being treated as a suspect in Dunn's death, returned to the United States after the crash northwest of London.Sacoolas' departure prompted Dunn's family to appeal for justice and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to raise the issue with President Donald Trump.Speaking from Heathrow Airport, Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, said that she was \"very, very open\" to meeting with Sacoolas. But, she added, \"Sorry just doesn't cut it.\"\"It's not really quite enough,\" she said.In her statement, Sacoolas said she had cooperated with authorities at the scene of the accident and later at her home.The police superintendent in Northamptonshire told NBC News the department had sought to conduct additional interviews with Sacoolas but needed the U.S. Embassy to waive her diplomatic immunity.The application for a waiver was declined and Sacoolas returned to the United States, said the superintendent, Sarah Johnson.Boris Johnson has said diplomatic immunity wasn't appropriate for such an incident, while Sky News reported Sunday that the country's Foreign and Commonwealth Office told Dunn's family that immunity was no longer \"relevant\" because Sacoolas had returned to the United States.Asked to confirm the report, a spokesperson for the department said in an email to NBC News: \"I can't officially confirm this but I'm not steering you away from what you have just suggested.\"", "description": "\"Sorry just doesn't cut it,\" said the mother of Harry Dunn, 19, who was killed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4229994/1000x563_nbc-191006-harry-dunn-cs-148p_11f7a0c664b12c40dab94b0c97e95bb1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
