Smaller hotels would have to follow suit in 2024.\n\nKaminsky, a Democrat representing Long Island, cited that hotels in New York City alone dispose of an estimated 27million plastic toiletry bottles annually.\n\nIn a statement announcing the bill, he said: 'Little everyday actions, like eliminating small plastic bottles, will have a positive impact on our environment.\n\n'By barring hotels from giving single-use plastic toiletries to customers, we are safeguarding our environment, and mitigating plastic waste and waterway pollution.'\n\nThe Hotel Association of New York City and the state Hospitality and Tourism Association both back Kaminsky's bill, reflecting growing industry support for the idea.\n\nVijay Dandapani, president and CEO of the Hotel Association of New York City, called it 'an important environmental protection effort'.\n\nMarriott International, the world's largest hotel chain, announced plans last month to eliminate small plastic toiletry bottles worldwide by December 2020.\n\nEarlier this year IHG, which owns Holiday Inn, Kimpton and other brands, said it would eliminate about 200million tiny bottles each year by 2021.\n\nHotels would have to use wall-mounted dispensers, larger, multi-use bottles or materials other than plastic to package single-use bottles\n\nMeanwhile, in April, a bill was passed in California that would ban mini toiletries in plastic bottles in hotels across the state.\n\nIf successfully implemented as a law, 'lodging establishments', including hotels, motels, resorts, bed and breakfasts, and vocational rentals, would be forbidden from offering plastic bottles that hold 12 ounces of fluid or less.\n\nLawmakers in New York are expected to consider Kaminsky's proposal after they reconvene in Albany in January.", "description": "State lawmakers in New York are proposing that the tiny plastic bottles should be ditched from hotels in favor of wall-mounted dispensers or larger, multi-use bottles in order to reduce plastic waste.", "authors": ["Jennifer Newton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/23/12/18821426-0-image-a-6_1569237361129.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
