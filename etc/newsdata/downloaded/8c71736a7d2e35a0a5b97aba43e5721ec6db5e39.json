Organic sales have been strong for decades growing at 12% a year since 2000.\n\nIn the near term, the Canadian cannabis market will be worth $5 billion and organic demand will ultimately make up 20% of the market, creating a $1 billion revenue opportunity. This would equal the medium-term demand potential of $8.5 billion for organic cannabis.\n\nBy 2020 there will only be four certified organic producers operating globally and their supply will struggle to keep up with rapidly growing demand.", "description": "Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - September 16, 2019) - Capital 10X announces the release of an Initiation Report on the Organic Cannabis Market that features The Green Organic Dutchman among other organic cannabis producers.
