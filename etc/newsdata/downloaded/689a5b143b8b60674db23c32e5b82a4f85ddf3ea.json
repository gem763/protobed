REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - Carrefour (CARR.PA), Europe\u2019s largest retailer, said on Tuesday that sales growth slowed in the third quarter, reflecting a weaker performance in its core French market where fewer promotional periods notably hit hypermarket sales.\n\nCarrefour nevertheless said that it was on track with a strategic overhaul plan aimed at boosting earnings and sales and that it was sticking with its targets under the plan.\n\nThird-quarter sales came to 20.2 billion euros(17.39 billion pounds). Growth reached 2.3 percent on a like-for-like basis - excluding fuel and calendar effects - against 3.9% in the second quarter.\n\nCarrefour is in the midst of a five-year plan to cut costs, boost e-commerce investment and step up its focus on organic food and convenience stores to tackle competition from the likes of unlisted rival Leclerc and Amazon (AMZN.O).", "description": "Carrefour , Europe's largest retailer, said on Tuesday that sales growth slowed in the third quarter, reflecting a weaker performance in its core French market where fewer promotional periods notably hit hypermarket sales.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443782876&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L1E4", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
