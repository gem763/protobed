It will be on-air from 5pm to 10pm Monday to Friday on TV.", "description": "The constant, unrelenting bluster, confusion and contradiction of seemingly never-ending Brexit updates has seen people switch off from the news - so a new channel has launched", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Bloomberg Via Getty Images", "Wiktor Szymanowicz", "Barcroft Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13657755.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Murdochs-News-Corp-Bids-for-Full-Control-of-BSkyB-Satellite.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
