Some 400,000 U.S. overdose deaths between 1997 and 2017 were linked to opioids, according to government data.\n\nOn Friday, talks collapsed aimed at reaching a broader $48 billion settlement covering thousands of lawsuits filed by counties, towns and states from across the country over the crisis.\n\nThe value of the settlement could not be determined. Opening arguments at trial were scheduled to begin at 9:30 am ET in Cleveland.\n\nAttorneys were seen hugging and congratulating each other outside the courtroom.\n\nThe outcome of the trial was expected to help shape a broader settlement of the more than 2,300 lawsuits against a larger number of defendants, including health conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N).", "description": "Four drug companies reached a last-minute legal settlement over their role in the opioid addiction epidemic, a source said on Monday, just as a nine-week trial was scheduled to start in Cleveland.", "authors": ["Kathy Gray", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443342609&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0R5", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
