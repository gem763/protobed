The missile had been there since a failed test in February 2018.\n\nAfter the explosion, Russian officials called for an evacuation of an area near Nyonoksa, Russia, and then called it off.\n\nFour nuclear monitoring stations went offline shortly after the accident, and Russian officials did not tell doctors treating victims of the accident about potential radiation poisoning. Later, Russian security agents requested that hospital staff sign non-disclosure agreements, The Moscow Times originally reported.\n\nAn entrance checkpoint to a military garrison near the village of Nyonoksa in Arkhangelsk Region, Russia, October 7, 2018. Reuters\n\n\"One of the things we were clear about is Russia has to answer for this \u2014 they have a lot to answer for,\" not just to the Russian people and nearby countries but to the entire world, DiNanno said.\n\n\"This affects countries in South America [and] Africa as much as it does those immediate countries. It's not specifically about the accident. It's about how reckless Russia's weapons development program is, how aggressive it is,\" he said.\n\nThe weapon, the 9M730 Burevestnik, a nuclear-powered cruise missile also called Skyfall, is part of what DiNanno referred to as an exotic weapons package. The Skyfall missile is not covered by the new START treaty, a nuclear nonproliferation treaty between the US and Russia.\n\n\"We believe these exotic systems either shouldn't exist, and if they do exist, we have to have a discussion on ... how they would be controlled,\" DiNanno told Insider. The Skyfall missile is one of five so-called exotic systems Russia announced last year that are not authorized under the treaty.\n\nDiNanno estimated that the missile, which was not armed with nuclear warheads, was between about 60 miles and 120 miles from a population center while it was the bottom of the White Sea after the failed test last year.\n\nBut when the weapon's nuclear reactor exploded during recovery efforts, \"The Russian reaction to this was immediately to cover it up and shut off the international monitoring stations in Russia that are part of the CTBT,\" or Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, although the treaty is not yet entered into force, DiNanno said.\n\n'This behavior is not acceptable'\n\nA street in the military garrison near the village of Nyonoksa in Arkhangelsk Region, Russia, October 7, 2018.

This behavior is not acceptable.\"", "description": "State Department officials told Insider that Russia's actions after an August 8 nuclear accident amount to a cover-up.", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/557ad42feab8ead12a9dba88?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
