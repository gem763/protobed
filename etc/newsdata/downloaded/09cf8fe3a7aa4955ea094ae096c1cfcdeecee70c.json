A Stealth Tanker Could Solve It.", "language": "en", "text": "Key point: Tankers are vulnerable but needed to extend the range of stealth fighters, so why not make a stealth tanker?\n\nThe United States has devoted billions of dollars to building stealth fighters, stealth bombers, stealth cruise missiles and stealth spy drones. Surely a stealth tanker for refueling aircraft midflight would be an extravagance too much?\n\nHowever, the concept of a stealth tanker is not as absurd you\u2019d think for one simple reason: the Pentagon\u2019s F-35 and F-22 stealth fighters, which it has made the lynchpin of its twenty-first century air warfare strategy, simply can\u2019t fly far enough.\n\nAt first glance, the F-35\u2019s six to eight-hundred-mile range doesn\u2019t seem bad compared to conventional fighters like the Super Hornet or F-16. But those non-stealth designs can carry fuel in in underwing tanks into combat\u2014meanwhile, an F-35 can\u2019t carry those extra lumps of metal under its wings if it wants to preserve its miniscule radar cross-section.\n\nAnother problem with the short range of stealth and non-stealth fighters alike is the need to deploy them airbases or aircraft carriers well within range of an adversary\u2019s ballistic and cruise missiles. Conflicts ranging from World War II to Afghanistan have shown that advanced fighters are never more vulnerable than when they are caught on the ground (or a carrier deck). It is virtually a given that in the event of a great power conflict, a terrifying missile barrage would rain down on forward airbases; and just how many airframes would emerge intact from that hail of death is anybody\u2019s guess.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "The United States has devoted billions of dollars to building stealth fighters, stealth bombers, stealth cruise missiles and stealth spy drones.
