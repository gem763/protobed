Some of the most important posts have gone to other elected officials. Jon Huntsman and Terry Branstad, who respectively serve as ambassadors to Russia and China, previously served as governors. So did Nikki Haley, who represented the U.S. at the United Nations until earlier this year. Scott Brown, the current ambassador to New Zealand, is a former Massachusetts senator. But even key diplomatic posts aren\u2019t off-limits to those who\u2019ve made financial contributions: David Friedman, who donated $50,000 to the Trump campaign and the RNC in 2016, currently serves as U.S. ambassador to Israel.\n\nTelecommunications advancements and the modern campaign-finance system helped transform top diplomatic posts into lucrative sources of patronage. The White House taping system recorded Richard Nixon discussing the process in candid detail. \u201cMy point is that anybody who wants to be an ambassador must at least give $250,000,\u201d he instructed White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman in 1971. \u201cYeah,\u201d Haldeman replied, \u201cI think any contributor under $100,000 we shouldn\u2019t consider for any kind of thing.\u201d Nixon later suggested in the tapes that his personal lawyer had told donors that a quarter-million dollar contribution to his 1972 re-election campaign would be the minimum requirement for an ambassadorship.\n\nThere\u2019s strong evidence that lush overseas postings flow frictionlessly to a presidential candidate\u2019s most generous backers.\n\nModern presidents probably aren\u2019t so explicitly transactional about the practice. But there\u2019s strong evidence that lush overseas postings flow frictionlessly to a presidential candidate\u2019s most generous backers. In 2012, two Pennsylvania State University researchers published a study that found a strong correlation between non-career appointments, placement in safe countries, and the size of the nominee\u2019s campaign contributions. Drawing upon data from Barack Obama\u2019s first term, the researchers found that campaign donations between \u201c$650,000 and $700,000 generate a 90% probability of appointment to a [wealthy developed country] for personal and bundled campaign contributors respectively.\u201d\n\nA quick glance at the list of U.S. ambassadors to the Court of St. James\u2019s\u2014the formal title for diplomats sent to the United Kingdom\u2014underscores the situation. Woody Johnson, the current ambassador and an owner of the New York Jets, donated $1.5 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and campaign efforts. Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Matthew Barzun, served as Obama\u2019s national finance chairman and bundled more than $1 million for his campaign. Barzun\u2019s predecessor, Louis Susman, reportedly earned the nickname \u201cthe Vacuum Cleaner\u201d for his fundraising skills on behalf of Democratic politicians. Susman\u2019s predecessor, Robert Tuttle, gave more than $100,000 to George W. Bush\u2019s campaign. Tuttle turned out to be quite fortunate to have earned the post with such a scant offering: The PSU study estimated that the price range for London \u201clies between $650,000 and $2.3 million.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile their personal connections to presidents may give donor-ambassadors an edge when it comes to policy decisions, they are hardly the most qualified people to take the job. That inexperience can bring scandal. Cynthia Strom, one of Obama\u2019s ambassadors to Luxembourg, resigned the post in 2011 shortly before an inspector\u2019s general report described her as \u201caggressive, bullying, hostile, and intimidating.\u201d NPR reported that some State Department employees accepted transfers to Kabul and Baghdad as a result. Larry Lawrence, who raised millions for Democrats and later served as Bill Clinton\u2019s ambassador to Switzerland in the 1990s, was fined by the FEC for exceeding federal donation limits. Lawrence\u2019s body was later exhumed from Arlington National Cemetery after it emerged that he had fabricated his service in World War II.", "description": "The Sondland scandal should prompt lawmakers to end the practice of rewarding deep-pocketed cronies with plum overseas postings.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/c5faa47fd9d2ecd83be9a25fc3d46a2c68993865.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
