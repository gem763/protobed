He started smoking marijuana at 13, snorted cocaine at 15, sampled crystal meth at 17, eventually becoming addicted to liquid cocaine and heroin.\n\nWhen Sawyer asked him candidly how close he was to dying, he answered, \"Probably pretty close.\"\n\nCameron Douglas wrote that he was \"playing a game of chicken\" with his life.\n\nOn July 28, 2009, Cameron Douglas was arrested by the Drug Enforcement Administration in a sting operation and later pleaded guilty to heroin possession and conspiracy to distribute drugs. He served seven years and was released in 2016.\n\nHe agreed with Sawyer that its \"a kind of miracle\" he is OK today.\n\n\"I like the sound of that word,\" he said with a smile. \"It sounds good.

I should've changed my priorities. My career was first. My career came before my family.\"\n\n\"My marriage was not great,\" Michael Douglas added. \"So you do hide yourself in your work -- I should've focused more on my family, but that's hard to say when you're in the midst of a career, when you are in your own mind, stepping out of your father's shadow, trying to create a life for your own.\"\n\nPHOTO: Cameron Douglas, Kirk Douglas and Michael Douglas attend the ceremony honoring Michael Douglas with a Star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame held on November 06, 2018, in Hollywood.
