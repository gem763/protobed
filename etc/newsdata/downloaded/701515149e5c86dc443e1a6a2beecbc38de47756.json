REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nThe main index .FTSE, which earns more than two-thirds of its profits in dollars, rose 0.3% by 0801 GMT as sterling weakened ahead of the parliament votes on whether to hold an early election on Oct.15.\n\nShell (RDSa.L) and BP (BP.L) climbed higher by 1% each, tracking a rise in crude prices. [O/R]\n\nThe FTSE 250 midcap index .FTMC was up by roughly the same level, led by a 17% jump in Intu Properties (INTUP.L) after the Times reported that private equity firm Orion Capital Managers was looking to buy the shopping centre operator.\n\nRises on both the bourses come ahead of a slew of British economic data, including gross domestic product data, scheduled this morning.\n\nInvestors are expecting central banks to step in with stimulus plans after a data showed an unexpected fall in China\u2019s exports last month, while another one pointed to a slowdown in Japan\u2019s economy in the second quarter.\n\nThe weakness reflected an impact from the prolonged Sino-U.S. trade war to global economic growth.\n\nThe dispute saw a sharp escalation last month when the United States announced tariffs going up to $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. That had dragged the FTSE 100 to its biggest monthly fall so far this year that month.\n\nOn Monday, the FTSE 100 saw some sharp news-related falls, with Associated British Foods (ABF.L) losing 3.3% after poor outlook for its Primark fashion chain and British Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L) dropping 2.6% as it cancelled nearly all its flights due to strikes.\n\nSmaller airlines such as easyJet (EZJ.L) and Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) were also down 3% and 2.5%, respectively.\n\nLloyds (LLOY.L) was the biggest drag with a 2% dip after Britain\u2019s largest lender said it is suspending its 2019 share buyback programme and will make extra provisions for payment protection insurance claims.\n\n\u201cInvestors may also worry about the dividend, however we do know that the later the claims, the less chance they have of success,\u201d Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said.", "description": "London's FTSE 100 inched up on Monday as shares of oil majors rose on hopes that Saudi Arabia's new energy minister will continue to support output cuts, while a fall in the local currency also aided the exporter-heavy bourse.", "authors": ["Indranil Sarkar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427861268&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880IR", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
