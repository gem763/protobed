It is thought that one of them has since been arrested on suspicion of people smuggling\n\nThey are left floating in the water with fire still raging around them. The boat was completely destroyed.\n\nIt is believed the fire was caused by an explosion in a near-empty fuel tank.\n\nThe dramatic incident happened off the coast of the Mediterranean island of Albor\u00e1n between the Spanish mainland and north Africa.\n\nIt was spotted by a Portuguese aircraft patrolling the borders who called in Maritime Rescue.\n\nLife boats were thrown into the water for the immigrants to climb into whilst one of the 34 was plucked to safety by the emergency helicopter.\n\n'We feared for our lives,' said one of them.\n\nMore than 1,000 migrants have died trying to cross the Mediterranean so far in 2017, the vast majority of those by drowning (pictured, the migrants are rescued by the Spanish coastguard)\n\nA spokesman for Spain's maritime rescue said. 'There was panic, tension and nerves but luckily it all worked out well in the end.'\n\nAll 34 were treated by the Red Cross on their arrival at the port of Motril in Granada before being taken on to hospital. They were then put in a make-shift camp before they are processed and sent back home.\n\nIt is understood one man has been arrested in connection with illegal trafficking.\n\nUN figures released in April showed the death toll of migrants crossing the Mediterranean has already passed 1,000, with around 150 thought to be children.\n\nMany drowned after over-filled boats capsized, while some were crushed to death, suffocated or starved while adrift at sea.", "description": "A group of 34 migrants, including nine women, were making their way from Africa to Spain when an explosion in the fuel tank of their dinghy caused the boat to burst into flames.", "authors": ["Rita Sobot For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/30/15/40EFF34100000578-0-image-a-125_1496152900690.jpg", "published_at": "2017-05-30"}
