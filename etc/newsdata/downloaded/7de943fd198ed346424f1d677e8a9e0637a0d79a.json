Kevin Leighton/UK Supreme Court/Handout via REUTERS\n\nOnly in existence since 2009, the Supreme Court and its unashamedly feminist president Brenda Hale, 74, are to rule next week on the constitutional crisis engulfing Britain over its torturous, mooted departure from the European Union (EU).\n\nSpecifically, the nation\u2019s top court is to decide whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully by asking Queen Elizabeth to suspend parliament for five weeks in order, as foes allege, to sidestep opposition to his Brexit-or-die agenda.\n\nNever in its short history has the Supreme Court weighed such a momentous case. And never have Britons been treated to so many modern trappings at a core establishment institution.\n\nUnlike other British courts, Hale and her fellow judges do not wear wigs nor do they sit in an elevated position.\n\nWhile TV cameras are barred from nearly all other tribunals, the Supreme Court\u2019s live stream on the first day of the hearing over Johnson was accessed on its website more than 4 million times.\n\n\u201cWe will have to decide what the answer is and we will have to decide in one way or another what the consequences of that answer is,\u201d Hale told the court of a matter throwing British politics and society into turmoil.\n\n\u201cNone of this is easy.\u201d\n\nAs well as having a major impact on how Brexit plays out with an Oct. 31 divorce deadline looming, the court\u2019s ruling could be a pivotal determination on the future balance of power between Britain\u2019s government and parliament.\n\nBrexiteer Johnson, a former London mayor known for his mop of blond hair and getting stuck on a zip-wire during a London Olympics publicity stunt, advised the 93-year-old queen on Aug. 28 to prorogue - UK parlance for suspend - parliament.\n\nBREXIT MAELSTROM\n\nThe shutdown duly came into effect on Sept. 10 amid chaotic protests by opposition lawmakers in the lower House of Commons on the banks of London\u2019s River Thames.\n\nLawmakers will not sit again until Oct. 14, just over a fortnight before Britain is set to leave the EU, with Johnson promising that will happen with or without a deal with the bloc.\n\nCritics say he wants to stymie parliament where a majority do not support a no-deal Brexit. Johnson says he merely wants to introduce a new legislative agenda and parliament would be off for most of the intervening time anyway.\n\nThrust into this Brexit maelstrom, Hale has insisted her court is determining points of law, not politics.\n\n\u201cI must repeat that this case is not about when or on what terms the United Kingdom leaves the European Union,\u201d she told the court as hearings finished on Thursday.\n\nThe case will show how far the Supreme Court\u2019s judicial reach can go in Britain\u2019s unwritten constitution, and to what extent the powers of the executive should be limited.\n\nSifting through legal precedence from cases and laws dating back hundreds of years, Johnson\u2019s team argued judges should not interfere in politics and limit the prime minister\u2019s use of prerogative powers - functions he carries out in the monarch\u2019s name.\n\nIn this week\u2019s hearings, however, some of the 11 justices on the court seemed more keen to know why the prime minister had not signed a witness statement with reasons for the suspension.\n\nThe 2016 Brexit referendum has divided Britain bitterly and the question of whether Johnson acted unlawfully has split its courts. Scotland\u2019s top court declared his suspension of parliament illegal, but the High Court of England and Wales said it was a political issue and not one for judges.\n\nWhen the courts in 2016 last trod into matters of such constitutional significance - whether the government needed parliament\u2019s approval before triggering the formal EU divorce process - they drew the ire of Brexit-supporting newspapers.\n\n\u201cEnemies of the People,\u201d said the Daily Mail headline above a photograph of three senior High Court judges after they ruled parliament\u2019s approval was needed.\n\nIt was a decision backed by the Supreme Court, which has replaced the House of Lords, Britain\u2019s upper parliamentary chamber, as the nation\u2019s highest judicial body over criminal, civil and constitutional matters. Hale noted three lawyers arguing the Johnson case were themselves lords.\n\nLEGAL PIONEER\n\nShe became Supreme Court president two years ago and is emblematic of its surprisingly modern face.\n\nUnlike most contemporaries, Hale, brought up in northern England and educated at a state school, was an academic lawyer specialising in family and welfare issues and spent most of her career as a pioneer in her field.\n\nWhen she became a High Court judge in 1994, she was the first to have done so having had a career as an academic and public servant rather than a practising courtroom lawyer.\n\nShe was Britain\u2019s first female law lord in 2004 and until recently the top court\u2019s only woman. Last year, she made a brief appearance on a TV cooking show MasterChef.\n\nIn a speech in May at Girton College, Cambridge, where she attended in the 1960s, graduating top of her class, she said a former senior judge had described her in his diaries as \u201ca formidable, vigorous person with a strong agenda of her own\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat is this \u2018Brenda agenda\u2019 and why should voicing it arouse such feelings? It is, quite simply, the belief that women are equal to men and should enjoy the same rights and freedoms that they do,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo why is that \u2018an agenda\u2019? Quite simply, because we have not yet achieved the equality we seek in the law, let alone in life.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nNot shy about promoting equal rights for women and greater diversity in the judiciary, Hale\u2019s reforms of divorce and child law have led to her being singled out.\n\n\u201cThe Marriage Wrecker\u201d, one Daily Mail columnist described her as in a 2003 article, criticising her views on gay partnerships, heterosexual cohabitation and divorce.\n\nWhatever she and her 10 colleagues decide next week, Hale may once again take some heat.", "description": "Britain is renowned for its ancient, august and male-dominated institutions - yet its biggest moment since World War Two may be shaped by a mere decade-old court run by a very modern woman.", "authors": ["Michael Holden", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432035499&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1MQ", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
