(Vincent Thian/AP)\n\nThe fire-red Chinese flag was hoisted soon after day broke in Hong Kong on Tuesday, accompanied by the rousing national anthem, billowing in a square overlooking the glimmering Victoria Harbor: a ceremonial nod to the territory\u2019s sovereign masters on their 70th anniversary.\n\nBut no officials were to be seen. They were all inside a sprawling convention center hall, watching the ceremony on an LED screen. A designated public viewing area was empty, without anyone around to clap and cheer. Roads surrounding the ceremony were shut, as were nearby subway stations. The pomp and circumstance was reduced to a lone tugboat chugging through Victoria Harbor, water cannons spraying in the air and two helicopters towing flags flying past. An annual fireworks show planned for the evening was scrapped.\n\nThe muted celebrations underscore heightened tensions here as protesters and police gear up for what is billed to be perhaps the most significant \u2014 and violent \u2014 day in almost four months of sustained demonstrations in the Chinese semiautonomous territory.\n\nProtesters are hoping to send a clear message to Beijing on the 70th anniversary of Chinese Communist Party rule: Protect Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and grant it full democracy, or face continued and unending dissent designed to shame Chinese President Xi Jinping at a sensitive time in his tenure. Authorities are responding by putting in the city in lockdown mode, closing almost two dozen shopping malls, roads and key subway stations while warning of chaos.\n\n\u201cWe have to send a message to the government and the police, that we are not afraid of them, and that going out to protest is our right,\u201d said Fok, a 24-year-old who spoke on the condition that he be identified only by his last name, as he was already arrested once over protest participation. \u201cIt is time to show China they picked the wrong people to bully. This is a war, and we will win it.\u201d\n\nPolice warned of violence ahead of the anniversary, after another bloody and chaotic weekend of unauthorized protest in the city. At a news conference Monday, Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of the police\u2019s public relations branch, warned that the city was \u201con the verge of extreme danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll acts are one step closer to terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are deeply concerned about public safety tomorrow and we express the strongest condemnation against all criminal and violent acts.\u201d\n\nThe police force also sent text messages to all in Hong Kong, warning residents to stay alert and brace for \u201csevere disruptions.\u201d\n\nThe protests started as a rebuke against a now-scrapped piece of legislation that would have allowed fugitives to be transferred from Hong Kong\u2019s independent legal system to mainland China. But perceptions of government inaction and shock over police use of force has turned the movement into a full-blown rebuke of Beijing\u2019s tightening controls over the city, and revived a years-long demand for direct elections of city leaders.\n\nProtesters have settled on a list of five demands \u2014 withdrawal of the extradition bill was just one of them \u2014 but the government has declined to make further concessions, including an independent investigation into the police.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam traveled to Beijing with a delegation of more than 240 people to attend the anniversary extravaganza there, which will include a show of Chinese military firepower. Lam\u2019s party was made up of business tycoons and pro-Beijing lawmakers.\n\nMatthew Cheung, the territory\u2019s chief secretary, took over as acting chief executive in her absence and delivered Hong Kong\u2019s national day speech.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s special status under \u201cOne Country, Two Systems,\u201d Cheung said, has rendered \u201cit the most open and freest city\u201d in China.\n\nRecent instability, however, \u201chas seriously undermined social order and impacted the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cShocked and saddened by the violence that has turned the city that we call home into an unfamiliar place, Hong Kong people desperately yearn to get out of the existing gridlock,\u201d Cheung said, adding that his government has shown the \u201cgreatest sincerity\u201d in offering a dialogue with the community.\n\nTimothy McLaughlin and Tiffany Liang contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nWill China crush Hong Kong protests?
