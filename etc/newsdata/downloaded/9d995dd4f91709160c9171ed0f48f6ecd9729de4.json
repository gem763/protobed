Beech was jailed for 18 years in July after being found guilty of perverting the course of justice.\n\nSir Richard\u2019s report says there were numerous opportunities to spot his lies in the early stages of the inquiry and shut the case down.\n\nMs Dick admitted receiving initial briefings on Operation Midland, but insists that as she left the Met in December 2014 - before returning as Commissioner in 2017 - her knowledge of the investigation was limited.\n\nSir Stephen House, the Met\u2019s deputy commissioner, issued an apology following the report\u2019s publication, stating: \u201cI am deeply, deeply sorry for the mistakes that were made and the ongoing pain these have caused \u2026 I promise we will do all we can to prevent them in the future.\u201d", "description": "Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has been accused of \u201cwashing her hands\u201d of her force\u2019s handling of bogus VIP sex ring allegations.", "authors": ["Patrick Sawer", "Edward Malnick", "Martin Evans", "Senior News Reporter", "Sunday Political Editor", "Crime Correspondent", "David Trimble", "Roderick Crawford", "Stephen Barclay"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000208986626-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqufPWexoDNO0wvV3FQMbBIMPgwNfBwKBHKlx2e4jvRJ0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
