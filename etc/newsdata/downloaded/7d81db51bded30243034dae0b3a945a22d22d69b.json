On Monday, a second woman, an unnamed artist, alleged that Brown exposed himself to her while she was working on a mural for him at his Pittsburgh home in 2017.\n\nBrown's lawyer denied the assault allegations.\n\nDespite being wary of Brown\u2019s \u201cflighty\u201d reputation, Prisk said he took the initial meeting with the NFL star and subsequently took him on as a client. Now, the doctor is suing Brown for $11,500 in unpaid fees.\n\nPrisk said whenever he would bring up the payments, for which he claimed they had an oral agreement that he would be paid $500 an hour, Brown would pivot to promises of the two going into business together.\n\n\u201cIn his very first meeting with me he said, \u2018I want to get you on salary, I want you on my team,\u2019\u201d Prisk said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cHe tells you he\u2019s going to make it totally worth your while,\u201d Prisk added. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna invest in your business, invest in you.
