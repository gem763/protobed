The service, built in collaboration with Radisys, a U.S.-based subsidiary of Reliance Industries, can be accessed via a 4G phone call and does not require installation of any additional app, Jio said.\n\nExecutives of Reliance Jio demonstrated the technology on Monday at the third installment of Indian Mobile Congress, similar to but not affiliated with the trade show Mobile World Congress. They said they have already courted a number of customers for this service, including HDFC Bank.\n\nIn the demo, a user dials a regular phone number and sees a video chat option. Once tapped, the user is greeted by a pre-recorded video message from a human. To demonstrate the AI\u2019s capabilities, an executive of Reliance Jio asked the bot what was the interest rate on personal loans. The human-looking bot was able to answer the question without any delay.\n\nThe company, which became the largest telecom operator in India in three years, is also offering audio and text bot options to brands, executives said. \u201cIt may be a large business or small, our bot service is built for all,\u201d one of the two executives said.\n\nThe company said its developer toolkit \u2014 called Jio Bot Maker \u2014 will allow brands to build and deploy the AI assistant in \u201cjust five minutes.\u201d\n\nThe company is hoping to address the \u201ccurrent customer pain points like endless call-hold music or seemingly never-ending IVR wait-times,\u201d it said, as it looks to court more businesses in the country.\n\nEarlier this year, Reliance Jio inked a deal with Microsoft to bring Office 365 and other services from the Redmond-headquartered giant to small businesses in India for subsidized cost.\n\nThe company has also developed a point-of-sale machine that its agents are increasingly trying to sell to neighborhood stores in the nation. Popularly known as kirana stores, these millions of mom and pop shops dot the entire country.\n\nReliance Industries, parent firm of Reliance Jio and the largest industrial house in the nation, also operates the largest retail chain in the country, called Reliance Retail. Despite billions of dollars spent on India\u2019s e-commerce market, online sales still amount for just 3% of the overall sales in the nation, according to industry estimates.\n\nThe person who appears on the video chat could be replaced by anyone from the CEO of a company to a brand ambassador, Reliance Jio said. \u201cWe aim to democratize AI by enabling small businesses to create their own AI-based Bot with no coding and with minimal effort,\u201d it added.\n\nThe company plans to introduce support for multiple languages to its bot service and serve \u201cmillions of businesses\u201d across various industries in India.\n\nJio did not reveal when it plans to launch the developer kit to the public, but a spokesperson told TechCrunch that it will be made available \u201cin the near future.\u201d\n\nJio has made no secret that it wants to develop AI assistants to help businesses. Last year, it acquired Haptik, a Mumbai-based startup that develops \u201cconversational\u201d platforms and virtual assistants. The size of the deal was $100 million.\n\nAakrit Vaish, co-founder and CEO of Haptik, told TechCrunch in an interview earlier that the startup was developing voice bots.", "description": "Before Google moves to bring its human-sounding robot calling service Duplex to help users automate their interactions with businesses to international markets, an Indian giant is deploying its own solution to get a jumpstart on the local market.
