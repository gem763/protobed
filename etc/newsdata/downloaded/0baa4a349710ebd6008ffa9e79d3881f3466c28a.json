Canadian authorities said in September a youth had been hospitalized, but so far no other countries have reported anything similar.\n\nPublic and political opinion appears to be hardening, however, with the administration of US President Donald Trump announcing in September it would ban in the coming months flavored e-cigarette products which are particularly attractive to young people.\n\nIndia has issued an outright ban on all e-cigarette products, as has the US state of Massachusetts.", "description": "Officials have yet to identify the cause for the outbreak, which dates back to late March, and are pursuing multiple lines of investigation.
