You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nLloyd George showed no loyalty to his liberal ideology and no loyalty to his former colleagues. Liberal MPs who did not receive the coalition coupon were by-and-large defeated.\n\nHe was in every sense the Boris Johnson of his day interested only in his status as prime minister. He was seen as a man without principles, interested only in office, and as unfaithful to his wife and family as our own prime minister.\n\nThe election was called with the kind of feverish language we hear from Dominic Cummings about Brexit.\n\nAnti-German demagogy about \u201csqueezing the Germans until the pips squeak\u201d and demands to \u201cHang the Kaiser\u201d were on the front page of the Daily Mail just as anti-European headlines have filled that paper since the Brexit referendum.\n\nThe Labour Party was presented as in the grip of mad Marxists inspired by the Bolshevik revolution much as Jeremy Corbyn is presented as a demented socialist controlled by communist aides seeking to turn Britain into Venezuela.\n\nThe coupon election handed over political control of Ireland to Sinn Fein. Ireland was quickly plunged into its short brutal war of independence as Lloyd George now firmly under the control of the Tory right refused any compromise or negotiated settlement much as Boris Johnson refuses all compromise on Brexit or meeting the EU half-way.\n\nLloyd George stayed in Downing Street but the coupon election reinforced the right and the Commons was full of what Stanley Baldwin called \u201clot of hard-faced men who look as if they had done very well out of the war\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, Boris Johnson will issue coupons to any Tory or indeed Labour candidate prepared to parrot the Brexit lines and the denunciations of Europe that he believes is the essence of modern English identity if he gets his way and holds an election. He hopes to see a \u201clot of hard-faced men and women\u201d on the benches behind him who look as if they have done very well out of denigrating Europe.\n\nWill he get his way? Does every Tory MP want to swear eternal obeisance to Johnson and the offshore owners of our press with their description of judges as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d and describing any MP who did not vote for extreme anti-European measures as guilty of \u201ctreason\u201d and \u201csabotage\u201d in the kind of extremist language used in the coupon election of a century ago?\n\nIt is far from clear that Johnson is our new Lloyd George, as much as he might like to be cast in this light.\n\nScotland is today what Ireland was a century ago, a nation no longer sure it wants to be ruled by an Old Etonian public school elite from southern England. Support for Scottish secession and separatism has increased strongly since 2016. A poll carried out by Lord Ashcroft soon after Johnson became prime minister showed for the first time since the European referendum a majority of Scots prepared to vote for secession.\n\nIn any general election that will be confirmed so like Sinn Fein in 1918, the SNP can expect to win most seats in Scotland.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nThere is a confusion between seats in the north that voted Leave, with the assumption they are all uniformly ready to vote for Johnson as prime minister. In fact in many so-called safe Labour working class seats up to half or more voters in a general election vote Tory, UKIP, BNP or for other opposition parties.\n\nIt is the UK\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system that makes seats so solidly Labour. But the majority of Labour voters also voted against cutting off economic ties with Europe and in a general election when there will be many more hearth and home issues in voters\u2019 minds \u2013 housing, health, zero hours contracts, crime, air quality, huge student loan debts \u2013 of far greater import than Brexit.\n\nThe BBC and broadcasters will have to give equal time to Corbyn and the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, and it is far from certain that a four- or five-week election campaign can be sustained only on the issue of Brexit. The Liberal Democrats today are insurgents unlike the tired old Asquith-Liberal ex-cabinet ministers in 1918. Johnson has terrible poll ratings with women, for obvious reasons.\n\nAny offer he makes on more spending on public services or raising the minimum wage can be easily matched by Labour.\n\nIn the end, Boris Johnson is not Lloyd George. He does not have Lloyd George\u2019s record of winning the great war still less of the progressive social reforms associated with George like bringing in pensions. About the only thing he shares with George is a keen interest in women or, as Sir Max Hastings crudely put it \u201cthe willy problem.\u201d\n\nIt is far from clear that a Brexit coupon election will work for Johnson. But like the First World War, Brexit is changing everything we thought we knew about politics in Britain.", "description": "In Simon Heffer\u2019s new 900-page history of the First World War, Staring at God, he describes the coupon election hysteria of a century ago.
