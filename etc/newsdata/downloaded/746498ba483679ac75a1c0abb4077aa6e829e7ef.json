The reason? NASA won\u2019t put a final price tag on the program.\n\nThe project is called the Artemis Program. Originally it was slated to launch a crewed mission to the Moon in 2028, but President Trump demanded that not only should the timeline be moved up to 2024, but that NASA should skip the Moon and go straight to Mars. Now, it\u2019s unlikely either will occur during the Trump presidency.\n\nAccording to a report from ArsTechnica, the House today expressed its reluctance to fund the mission under its new parameters. House Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee chair Jose Serrano told those present he was concerned that moving the original 2028 timeline up by four years posed a significant risk of failure. He also said:\n\nTo a lot of Members, the motivation appears to be just a political one\u2014giving President Trump a moon landing in a possible second term, should he be reelected.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time officials have had to intervene in the president\u2019s ill-advised attempts to rush the US into a space race. Just four months ago Trump tweeted his disdain for the \u201cMoon to Mars\u201d portion of the Artemis Program:\n\nFor all of the money we are spending, NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon \u2013 We did that 50 years ago. They should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part), Defense and Science! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 7, 2019\n\nAs The Verge reported, Bridenstine had to talk the president into the idea in person, ultimately explaining that astronauts and researchers needed the practice. Per Loren Grush\u2019s report in July:\n\nBridenstine explained: \u201cThe challenge is if we go direct to Mars, there\u2019s going to be a lot of things that we haven\u2019t yet proven out.\u201d Bridenstine went on to explain that the lunar surface contains water ice that could be mined and turned into rocket fuel, and NASA needs to practice using resources like this on other worlds.\n\nThe president eventually relented, and Bridentsine began the process of requesting billions in extra funding to meet the new 2024 goal. The White House came up with a plan to take the money from various other programs \u2013 including the Pell Grant \u2013 but the House today rejected it on the basis that Bridenstine, NASA, and the Trump administration can\u2019t seem to come up with a total cost for the project.\n\nRepresentative Serrano, according to the ArsTechnica report, told hearing attendees that \u201cUnless we know what this is going to cost at the end, it would be irresponsible for us to take the first step.\u201d Other Congressional members compared the prospect of funding an open-ended mission to that of making payments on a car without knowing the final, total cost.\n\nThis news makes yesterday\u2019s unveiling of the Artemis Program spacesuits all the more awkward \u2013 here\u2019s hoping NASA has some mothballs in its budget.\n\nRead next: Elon Musk\u2019s plan for sending people to Mars is probably a suicide mission", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F06%2FMoon.jpg&signature=aad8257798c6bdf04a2da51b9f66b573", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
