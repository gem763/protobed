Dedek was part of the majority.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Dedek said he still leaned toward leaving rates unchanged.\n\n\"Since the last meeting, where I voted for stable rates, there has been no argument which would push for raising rates,\" he said.\n\nThat includes inflation above the central bank's target level of 2%, he said, but still within a 1 percentage point tolerance band, which he said should be utilised.\n\n\"As we face negative news from abroad, I am not a hawk in a sense that I would insist on returning to 2%. The complete width of the fluctuation band needs to be used,\" he said.\n\nIn September, headline consumer price growth slowed to 2.7%, which Dedek called a \"pleasant surprise\".\n\nThe central bank is balancing a solid domestic economy, low unemployment and rising wages with global trade worries and weakening economies among its trade partners, notably Germany.\n\nEurope's largest economy should grow in the final quarter after contracting earlier in the year, the Ifo economic institute said last Friday.\n\nDedek said it was still early to debate rate cuts.\n\n\"I think a debate on a potential rate cut is very far away in view of inflation being close to the upper end of the tolerance band,\" he said. \"In this, the Czech economy is dealing with the opposite problem of the euro zone.\"\n\nThe situation abroad influences the crown's exchange rate , one of the factors weighed by the central bank's board. A stronger currency tightens monetary conditions; weakening loosens them.\n\nIn the past 90 days, the crown's average exchange rate was 25.72 to the euro, weaker than a 25.40 forecast by the central bank's staff outlook for the third quarter.\n\n\"It seems to me that there is no threat of a more pronounced weakening at the moment. However, that is one of the biggest uncertainties,\" Dedek said.\n\nHe also rejected the idea of the bank using its reserves to influence the exchange rate.\n\n\"We certainly would not want to make the impression that with the exchange rate not strengthening, we would try to push the exchange rate by some active currency policy. That is definitely not where the debate stands,\" Dedek said.
