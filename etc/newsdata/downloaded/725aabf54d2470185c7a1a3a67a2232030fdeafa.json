We\u2019re just coming up to 15 weeks pregnant and we\u2019ll be able to find out the gender of the baby soon.\u2019\n\nThe baby is due in April and Sue said that she wants a boy. She said: \u2018I wonder if it will be 11 of each \u2013 I am feeling a bit boy.\u2019\n\nThe couple live in a 10-bedroom house and rely on Noel\u2019s income as a baker and receive just \u00a3170 a week in child benefits.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe ever-growing family is about to get a little bigger (Picture: Rex Shutterstock)\n\nSue says she wants to have another boy to make it 11 of each (Picture: Rex Shutterstock)\n\nThey previously tried to put an end to their ever-growing brood when Neil had a vasectomy after baby number nine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he had that reversed so they could have more children and now they have Chris, 30, Sophie, 25, Chloe, 23, Jack, 22, Daniel, 20, Luke, 18, Millie, 17, Katie, 16, James, 15, Ellie, 14, Aimee, 13, Josh, 12, Max, 11, Tillie, nine, Oscar, seven, Casper, six, Hallie, three, Phoebe, two, and Archie, one, Bonnie Raye who was born last November.\n\nOnly the two eldest children do not live at home and Sophie has three kids of her own.\n\nIt costs around \u00a3350 a week to feed all their children and it takes three hours a day to tidy up the house.\n\nGoing out can be something of an ordeal for the Radfords (Picture: The Radford Family)\n\nSue also says that the pile of washing is \u2018non-stop\u2019 with nine loads of clothes going through the machines every day.\n\nEvery day they get through 18 pints of milk, four toilet rolls and three boxes of cereal.\n\nLast year, Sue told Femail: \u2018We do like to go to the cinema, especially in the holidays when the kids are a bit bored, it\u2019s raining and there\u2019s not much else for them to do. But it can be up to \u00a310 per person so it can work out really expensive!\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018Believe it or not, we don\u2019t tend to get group discounts because we find family tickets are usually for two adults and two children \u2013 and obviously there\u2019s a lot of us.\n\n\u2018We often look for the different discount codes you can find on the internet and go with whatever offers they\u2019ve got on.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOffering advice to other parents, she added: \u2018A lot of our best days out have been packing up a picnic and just going for a walk with the kids, or going to a park, or to the beach \u2013 and they\u2019re all free days out.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
