Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are getting back into the action in the new Bad Boys for Life trailer. Will Smith\u2019s Mike Lowrey is just as trigger happy as another Smith character, Deadshot. But Martin Lawrence\u2019s Marcus Burnett is ready for an extended vacation. The duo decide on one last all-out investigation and if Mike gets to shoot criminals along the way, well, then everyone\u2019s happy. Bad Boys for Life is the third iteration of the Bad Boys franchise. Bad Boys II came out 14 years ago, in 2003. Alexander Ludwig, Vanessa Hudgens, and Charles Melton feature in the film plus DJ Khaled and Nicky Jam. Bad Boys for Life comes out January 17, 2020, so in the meantime we will be listening to any other song on repeat.\n\nRelated", "description": "Watch the latest trailer for Martin Lawrence and Will Smith\u2019s \u2018Bad Boys for Life,\u2019 the third installment in the franchise.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/04/04-bad-boys-3.w1200.h630.jpg"}
