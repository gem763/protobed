But their cheers stopped suddenly, when Adam Eaton hit the mute button with a run-scoring single to left center. Anthony Rendon doubled off the wall moments later, giving Washington a 3-0 lead in Game 2 of the NLDS.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJust like that: Kershaw\u2019s night was effectively over, doomed by his poor first impression and a margin for error so thin as to be practically nonexistent. The Nationals held on through a tense ninth inning for a 4-2 win to even the series, leaving Kershaw with the loss and another round of unfulfilled expectations.\n\nThese were adverse circumstances and the playoffs are an especially hostile work environment. Every night in October, Kershaw pitches against the opponent and against his own track record. There were extra layers of shadows everywhere for him Friday. Walker Buehler had been dominant during a 6-0 Game 1 win. Compared to Buehler, Kershaw looked unprepared for the moment. And Strasburg looked electric through 4 2/3 perfect innings on just two days rest. Compared to the superhuman Strasburg, Kershaw was a mere mortal.\n\n\u201c[Trea] Turner hit a really well-placed groundball which is tough to start the game,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cYou\u2019re on the defense after that. And in the second inning, you hit [Victor] Robles to start the inning, that\u2019s tough. After that, I started getting leadoff hitters out a little bit better. It was a little bit too late.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSvrluga: Stephen Strasburg, in command of his full arsenal, puts the Nats on his back in Game 2\n\nThere is no tidy explanation for why a three-time Cy Young winner with a career .695 winning percentage and 2.44 ERA has fallen to 9-11 with a 4.32 ERA in the postsason. Reporters wondered whether he was tipping pitches. And even his manager, Dave Roberts, seemed a touch perplexed when he questioned why Kershaw wasn\u2019t relying heavily enough on his breaking balls during an in-game interview on TBS.\n\nTo crush Kershaw without qualification would be misguided. He responded to Rendon\u2019s double by retiring eight straight batters. After his early wobbles, he kept it together for six innings, giving up six hits and throwing 99 pitches. While the Nationals hit him hard all night, he salvaged a quality start in a fine outing. But this was a situation that called for more than fine.\n\n\u201cI thought Clayton did a good job of limiting damage,\u201d Roberts said. \u201c[The Nationals] were taking good swings and putting together good at-bats. It\u2019s a grind. The pitch count got up early.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the viewing public \u2014 those with the towels in the stadium and those with the tweets at home \u2014 expects Kershaw to inflict damage in high-pressure situations, rather than merely limit it.\n\nBehold the Astros, a team with no weaknesses. Good luck to everyone else in MLB playoffs.\n\nKershaw\u2019s desire and focus appear beyond reproach. When he stands on the mound and raises his hands high above his head before settling into his motion, his entire being snarls. When he pounced on a dribbler in the fourth inning, Kershaw seemed intent on decapitating the ball before throwing to first.\n\n\u201cOn game days, he\u2019s a completely different animal,\u201d Dodgers infielder Gavin Lux said before Game 2. \u201cSuper routine. You can learn a lot from him just watching how he goes about his business, and he\u2019s so fine in his routine and it\u2019s the same every single day.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome might suggest that Kershaw actually wants it too much, a charge that Nationals Manager Dave Martinez levied at his own team after a lackluster Game 1. That could help explain his early jitters, but it still feels lacking for a player with Kershaw\u2019s record of sustained greatness.\n\nAD\n\nThere is something unsettling about watching a star, even a diminished one, repeatedly fall short of his peak abilities. For the Dodgers, that sensation is surely amplified by the knowledge that Kershaw could face Strasburg again in a decisive Game 5.\n\nRoberts, though, chose to credit Kershaw with an indirect victory in defeat against a Nationals team that has now turned to Strasburg and starter Max Scherzer in relief stints during the postseason.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor Clayton to save our bullpen [was big],\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAs you look out, our high-leverage guys are rested and ready for Game 3. For him to give us six innings was big.\"\n\nMore Nationals and MLB playoffs:\n\nJuan Soto is a very quick learner.
