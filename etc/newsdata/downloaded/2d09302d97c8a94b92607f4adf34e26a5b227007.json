You can talk about results, I can talk about six out of seven good performances. West Ham, we know, was below par [losing 2-0] but it wasn\u2019t as bad as you lot made it out to be.\u201d\n\nAubameyang and VAR earn Arsenal draw to leave Manchester United in mire Read more\n\nIn a match of low quality, Scott McTominay had given United a first-half lead but Arsenal equalised just before the hour when VAR overturned an offside decision that had initially ruled out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s goal.\n\n\u201cHow many times have we been 1-0 up and not got the second goal?\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cThis is a steep learning curve for us and we\u2019ll keep working hard and, with more experience, we\u2019ll make the right decisions. It\u2019s another game that we\u2019re 1-0 up \u2013 Southampton, Wolverhampton, we need to learn to win these games.\u201d\n\nThe draw leaves United in 10th position while Arsenal move up to fourth but the Old Trafford crowd remained supportive of Solskj\u00e6r and his players \u2013 and the manager also received the backing of Roy Keane, his former team-mate.\n\nKeane\u2019s view in his role as a television pundit was that Solskj\u00e6r should \u201c100%\u201d be given more time. \u201cI think he has been brilliant, a good honest guy,\u201d the former United captain told Sky Sports. \u201cIt is hard work at the moment but there are six or seven young players learning their way. We\u2019re all very impatient, we want success yesterday, but you have to give the man time. He is frustrated, under pressure, but dealing with it. He\u2019s a classy guy but no doubt he will be disappointed at not winning enough games.\n\n\u201cThey have given him the job, so support him in a couple of transfer windows. Are there more tough days ahead? You bet your life but you need to stick with it. There was a lack of quality from both teams tonight. Their lack of goals, the lack of opportunities they\u2019re creating. Give these boys time. But on tonight\u2019s performance, none of them [neither Manchester United nor Arsenal] will be in the top four.\u201d\n\nHighlights fail to hide plight of two fallen giants lost in transition | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nUnai Emery, the Arsenal manager, described the game as 50-50 and tried to exonerate Granit Xhaka, the club\u2019s newly-installed captain, for seeming to duck out of the way of McTominay\u2019s shot for the opening goal. Xhaka had played with \u201cbig commitment\u201d, according to his manager. Emery added that he had not seen the replays of United\u2019s goal but that he had noted how determined Xhaka was to sprint back into position as the home team launched their counter-attack from an Arsenal corner.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r, who said that Anthony Martial might not be back from injury until after the next international break, thought his team ought to have been awarded a penalty and he was also unhappy about the unusual circumstances leading to Aubameyang\u2019s goal.\n\nUnited\u2019s argument was that their players hesitated when they saw the flag being raised. \u201cAshley [Young] certainly holds his hand up,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cHe looks straight at the linesman and maybe hesitates when he could have got a block in. That probably would have helped David [de Gea] but it is no consolation. It\u2019s a perfectly good goal for them, the linesman probably should have kept the flag down.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe didn\u2019t get out of the blocks quickly enough at the start of the second half. It felt like Arsenal were the more proactive until they scored their goal. I felt we could get a goal at the end and we sent men forward. I\u2019ve been in that situation as a player when you come off and think you could have got more out of a game but we\u2019ll learn from this.\u201d", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, the Manchester United manager, was frustrated by the 1-1 draw with Arsenal while Unai Emery was supportive of Granit Xhaka despite United\u2019s goal", "authors": ["Daniel Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89e012e656d71df1eefa3cbd70014de6ce221d93/98_270_3148_1889/master/3148.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=15523b04cb29cd3c3baa0cd372de0c76", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
