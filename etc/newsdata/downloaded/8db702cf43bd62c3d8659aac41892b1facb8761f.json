Evidence Reveals One Culprit: Russia.", "language": "en", "text": "The Russian Air Force has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Syria in order to crush the last pockets of resistance to President Bashar Assad, according to an investigation by The New York Times.\n\nAn analysis of previously unpublished Russian Air Force radio recordings, plane-spotter logs and witness accounts allowed The Times to trace bombings of four hospitals in just 12 hours in May and tie Russian pilots to each one.\n\nThe 12-hour period beginning on May 5 represents a small slice of the air war in Syria, but it is a microcosm of Russia\u2019s four-year military intervention in Syria\u2019s civil war. A new front in the conflict opened this week, when Turkish forces crossed the border as part of a campaign against a Kurdish-led militia.\n\nRussia has long been accused of carrying out systematic attacks against hospitals and clinics in rebel-held areas as part of a strategy to help Assad secure victory in the eight-year-old war.\n\nPhysicians for Human Rights, an advocacy group that tracks attacks on medical workers in Syria, has documented at least 583 such attacks since 2011, 266 of them since Russia intervened in September 2015. At least 916 medical workers have been killed since 2011.\n\nThe Times assembled a large body of evidence to analyze the hospital bombings on May 5 and 6.\n\nSocial media posts from Syria, interviews with witnesses, and records from charities that supported the four hospitals provided the approximate time of each strike. The Times obtained logs kept by flight spotters on the ground who warn civilians about incoming airstrikes and cross-checked the time of each strike to confirm that Russian warplanes were overhead. We then listened to and deciphered thousands of Russian Air Force radio transmissions, which recorded months\u2019 worth of pilot activities in the skies above northwestern Syria. The recordings were provided to The Times by a network of observers who insisted on anonymity for their safety.\n\nSpotter logs from May 5 and 6 put Russian pilots above each hospital at the time they were struck, and Air Force audio recordings from that day feature Russian pilots confirming each bombing. Videos obtained from witnesses and verified by The Times confirmed three of the strikes.\n\nRecklessly or intentionally bombing hospitals is a war crime, but proving culpability amid a complex civil war is extremely difficult, and until now, Syrian medical workers and human rights groups lacked proof.\n\nRussia\u2019s position as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council has shielded it from scrutiny and made U.N. agencies reluctant to accuse the Russian Air Force of responsibility.\n\nThe scene outside a bombed hospital in Syria. (Orient News via The New York Times) More\n\n\u201cThe attacks on health in Syria, as well as the indiscriminate bombing of civilian facilities, are definitely war crimes, and they should be prosecuted at the level of the International Criminal Court in The Hague,\u201d said Susannah Sirkin, director of policy at Physicians for Human Rights. But Russia and China \u201cshamefully\u201d vetoed a Security Council resolution that would have referred those and other crimes in Syria to the court, she said.\n\nThe Russian government did not directly respond to questions about the four hospital bombings. Instead, a Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed to past statements saying that the Russian Air Force carries out precision strikes only on \u201caccurately researched targets.\u201d", "description": "The Russian Air Force has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Syria in order to crush the last pockets of resistance to President Bashar Assad, according to an investigation by The New York Times.An analysis of previously unpublished Russian Air Force radio recordings, plane-spotter logs and witness accounts", "authors": ["Evan Hill", "Christiaan Triebert"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ALUEQhtWr9IUEgGHtbid_A--~B/aD0xMDc4O3c9MTkxMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/c119a31da1bb72c26bd968b86199cc6d", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
