MUST WATCH\n\n'Unbelievable'\n\nHowever, there is still an outside chance that German Daniel Deusser can cause an upset.\n\nDeusser, who is in third place, would need to rely on both men above him not qualifying for the weekend's Grand Prix event, which is unlikely given both are likely to bring their best horses -- Claire Z (Devos) and Explosion W (Maher) -- to the US.\n\nAmong the big-name Americans competing in front of their home crowd at the Governors Island venue off the southern tip of Manhattan are Georgina Bloomberg, Jessica Springsteen and Jennifer Gates.\n\n\"This is the first time in years that we will have the best showjumping riders in the world - not just in the country, in the world - come and jump in the highest level of competition,\" said Bloomberg, the daughter of businessman and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\n\"This is really the best of the best in the world and I think that anybody who comes will really see the excitement of the sport. I think that it's going to be the one that all the top riders really want to aim for.\"\n\nNew Jersey-raised Springsteen, who won the most recent LGCT Grand Prix in Saint-Tropez , added: \"It's my home town, my whole family are coming. I think it is going to be unbelievable - I'm so looking forward to it.\"\n\nPhotos: Best images from 2019 Global Champions Tour and GCL Saint-Tropez \u2013 Jessica Springsteen rode RMF Zecilie to her very first individual victory on the Global Champions Tour.
