Slack went public in June.\n\nThe slide followed the report that showed a larger-than-expected operating profit loss in the second quarter and a slightly trimmed outlook for the company's performance in the second half of fiscal 2020.\n\nHere's what the company reported, versus what analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected.\n\nRevenue: $145 million reported versus $142 million expected\n\n$145 million reported versus $142 million expected Loss per share: loss of $0.14 reported versus loss of $0.19 expected\n\nloss of $0.14 reported versus loss of $0.19 expected Gross margin: 87.1% reported versus 86% expected\n\n87.1% reported versus 86% expected Operating profit: loss of $364 million reported versus loss of $72.21 million expected\n\nThe company also noted that revenue was negatively impacted by $8.2 million of credits \"related to serve level disruption.\" Slack was down for two hours in the last quarter, which led to the credit cost.\n\nMarkets Insider is looking for a panel of millennial investors.

While the company raised its sales forecast to between $603 million and $610 million for the rest of the year, the midpoint was slightly under analyst expectations of $607.2 million.\n\n\"We remain focused on expansion within existing customers and growing our large enterprise customer base, and ended the quarter with 720 Paid Customers greater than $100,000 in annual recurring revenue, which is up 75% year-over-year,\" said Allen Shim, the chief financial officer at Slack, in a press release.\n\nIn addition, the release showed that the company's paid customer base is seeing slowed growth. The company added 5,000 paying customers in the quarter to 100,000 total, the growth represents a 37% increase from last year, down from 55%.\n\nWall street analysts that cover the company were unimpressed by the growth, which Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Bernstein, called \"anemic.\" He lowered his price target to $29 from $31.\n\nNine analysts say to buy Slack shares, while seven remain neutral. Only one analyst - Daniel Romanoff of Morningstar, Inc.- has a sell rating on the shares. He also has a price target of $14 for slack, much less than where the stock is currently trading around its direct-listing price of $26.\n\nShares of Slack were up 20% through Wednesday following its direct listing in June.\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "Slack reported its first quarterly earnings as a public company Wednesday.
