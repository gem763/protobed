That\u2019s because bad news is sure to follow.\n\nToday was a prime example in the stock market.\n\nA lucrative industry does not mean that every company is a good investment. And even when a company is good, it does not mean that the stock is appropriately priced. In addition, marijuana stocks in particular are vulnerable to unsustainable valuations, sentiment shifts, high volatility, short squeezes, and \u201cpump and dump\u201d schemes.\n\nAt this time, the last thing marijuana stock investors needed was a punch in the gut, but they got one anyway.\n\nLet\u2019s explore what happened today with the help of a chart.\n\nRead: Cannabis-stock sector slammed, with losses of as high as 24%\n\nChart\n\nPlease click here for an annotated chart of marijuana stock Tilray TLRY, -13.49%.\n\nNote the following:\n\n\u2022 The chart shows the zone that represents the price paid for Tilray\u2019s stock by a large number of investors who are still holding the stock.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows that, on average, a typical investor appears to have lost about 75% of her investment.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows the Arora signal to short-sell or sell Tilray as high as $280. The profits on the last tranche have been taken as low as $24. In short-selling, money is made when a stock falls.\n\n\u2022 The latest downturn in marijuana stocks is in response to an announcement by marijuana company Hexo Corp. HEXO, -22.55%. Hexo said fourth-quarter net revenue will be about $14.5 million to $16.5 million, and net revenue for the year will be about $46.5 million to $48.5 million. Both numbers are disappointing and below consensus estimates.\n\n\u2022 Hexo withdrew its fiscal 2020 outlook.\n\n\u2022 Hexo attributed the shortfall to slower-than-expected store roll-outs, pricing pressure, regulatory uncertainty and a delay in the approval of marijuana derivative products.\n\n\u2022 Hexo\u2019s stock promptly fell more than 20% for the day.\n\n\u2022 The inference is that the same factors are applicable to other popular marijuana stocks such as Canopy Growth Corp. CGC, -10.56%, Cronos Group CRON, -7.23%, Aphria APHA, -14.29% and Aurora Cannabis ACB, -9.49%.\n\n\u2022 Recently, in a surprise announcement, MedMen Enterprises MMNFF, -13.26% abandoned its buyout of PharmaCann, whose price was originally set at $600 million. It was the biggest marijuana deal in the U.S. at that time. MedMen\u2019s CFO was ousted. Those developments created a negative environment prior to Hexo\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u2022 The vaping-illness crisis is adding to negative sentiment, especially for a stock like Greenlane Holdings GNLN, +1.18%. For full disclosure, an Arora Report service has a highly profitable short position in Greenlane.\n\nAsk Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies.

The year-end is approaching. At The Arora Report, we expect significant tax-loss selling in marijuana stocks between now and Dec. 31 unless there is good news that buoys the industry.\n\nWhat to do now\n\nThe plan is to opportunistically pick the points when the selling is the greatest and buy select marijuana stocks. It is important that investors bring sophistication to their marijuana investing by implementing concepts such as long-term core positions and short-term trade-around positions. We also plan to selectively short-sell if there are \u201cup\u201d spikes.\n\nMarijuana investors ought to learn the skill advocated by Arora\u2019s 14th Law of Investing and Trading: \u201cTo be successful at investing and trading, become a master of position sizing.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: Subscribers to The Arora Report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time.
