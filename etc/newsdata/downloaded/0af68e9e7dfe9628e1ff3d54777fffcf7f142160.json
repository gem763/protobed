Time\n\nJennifer Garner may have been \"13 going on 30,\" but she says her 13-year-old won't be going on Instagram any time soon.\n\nThe 47-year-old actress discussed the phenomenon of parents posting pics of their kids on social media and why she doesn't allow her teen daughter Violet on Instagram, in an interview on \"Next Question with Katie Couric\" published Thursday.\n\nThough Garner, who shares three children with her ex-husband Ben Affleck, conceded social media \"makes you feel more connected,\" she worries about the toll these sites can take on kids' mental health.\n\n\"Without even having parents who are well-known, I worry about all kids having to deal with this new pressure,\" she said\n\nGarner added she's seen the power social media plays in her daughter's world.\n\nMore: Jennifer Garner criticizes 'People' magazine over cover story\n\n\"My daughter's at an all-girl school, and it's such a huge problem, and she'll occasionally talk to me about getting Instagram, and I can see why, because I'm on there (Instagram),\" she continued. \"It's something kind of fun that I do, and I am modeling the opposite of what I want for her to do. How often is that in parenting?\"\n\nJennifer Garner poses with her children Violet, left, Seraphina and Samuel in Hollywood last year.

The real thing is that there is no judgment in what other people do. It is such a personal choice.\"\n\nShe added: \"We really were hunted for so long, and I am not a whiny 'wah wah' person who put myself out in public and then said, 'Why are you taking pictures of me?' But it was so out of control, and it really marked my children's experience out in the world, and it shaped who they became in certain ways.\"\n\nIn addition to Violet, Garner and Affleck share Seraphina, 10, and Samuel, 7.\n\nMore: Jennifer Garner laments not being able to pick out her kids' Halloween costumes anymore\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/25/jennifer-garner-why-her-13-year-old-daughter-cannot-use-instagram/2459182001/", "description": "Jennifer Garner may have been '13 going on 30,' but here's why her 13-year-old won't be going on Instagram any time soon.", "authors": ["Charles Trepany", "Published P.M.
