British customs authorities would check goods going into Northern Ireland from the U.K. mainland and could collect customs duties if those goods are at \u201crisk\u201d of subsequently entering the EU market.\n\nEven though those duties are charged on goods entering the EU market, Brussels agreed the revenues would remain in the British budget: \u201cCustoms duties levied by the United Kingdom ... are not remitted to the Union,\u201d the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland says.\n\nBerlin, however, believes this is not the final word on the issue, according to Gunther Krichbaum, a senior lawmaker from Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and chair of the Bundestag\u2019s committee for European affairs.\n\n\u201cOf course, we have to see that we can retroactively find an appropriate compensation,\u201d he said in an interview, adding: \u201cThis view is also shared by the federal government.\u201d\n\n\"We have to see that we can retroactively find an appropriate compensation.\" \u2014 senior CDU lawmaker Gunter Krichbaum\n\nMichael Link, the liberal FDP party\u2019s EU spokesperson, said it would be \u201cquite strange\u201d if the U.K. was allowed to keep customs duties it levied on goods crossing the Irish sea and entering the EU market.\n\nThe German government on Monday briefed selected lawmakers on the Brexit deal and said that it would push for a compensation, according to another person, who was present at the meeting.\n\nA spokesperson for the German ministry of foreign affairs said Berlin \u201cof course stands by the decision\u201d of EU leaders to back the Brexit deal agreed with the U.K. prime minister, but did not comment on whether Germany would seek to obtain retroactive compensation.\n\nHowever, a European Commission official said the arrangement was \u201ca logical consequence of Northern Ireland remaining in the UK\u2019s customs territory,\u201d and that Brussels had no plans to arrange compensation.\n\nThe decision to allow Britain to keep the customs duties comes at a sensitive moment for the EU finances, as leaders debate the next seven-year budget cycle and grapple with how to fill the hole left by the departure of the U.K., which is a major net contributor.\n\nA European Commission official said the arrangement was \u201ca logical consequence of Northern Ireland remaining in the UK\u2019s customs territory.\"\n\nBerlin could seek to make compensatory payments a precondition for granting the U.K. market access under a planned future trade deal with the EU. Such a trade deal would see both sides lowering their tariff barriers, but the EU market is much bigger, giving it more leverage in the talks.\n\nFranziska Brantner, a German MP and the Green party\u2019s spokesperson for European affairs, also backed the call for reimbursement, and suggested Berlin could request compensation through the fees the U.K. would have to pay to remain in certain EU programs. That could include its membership of Eurodac, the fingerprint database for asylum seekers, she said.", "description": "New Brexit agreement would see London keep duties it levies on goods entering the EU.", "authors": ["Hans Von Der Burchard", "Joshua Posaner", "Emilio Casalicchio", "David M.
