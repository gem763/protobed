Each has its own unique character and long list of impressive alumni. You can visit most of the colleges \u2013 either wander at will or, better still, plan via the university website. A good way to get your bearings is to take a free two-hour walking tour with a student, who will regale you with stories while leading you past the city\u2019s landmarks.\n\nIf you can only do one college, make it the mighty Christ Church, where past students include 13 British Prime Ministers and Albert Einstein. Harry Potter fans can see some filming sites there, plus the dining room which provided the inspiration for Hogwarts\u2019 Great Hall (look out, too, for the stained glass window featuring Alice Liddell \u2013 the inspiration for Alice in Wonderland). The chapel at Christ Church serves as the cathedral for the diocese of Oxford and visitors can attend evensong here for free.\n\nAdmire the architecture\n\nThis is one well preserved city. Tempting Instagram opps include the iconic Radcliffe Camera, the first circular library in the country, The Sheldonian Theatre (where university graduation ceremonies take place and visitors can catch a concert) and The Bridge of Sighs \u2013 named after its similarity to the famous bridge in Venice \u2013 which links two parts of Hertford College.\n\nTake a punt\n\nSure, you can hire out a rowboat or pedalo on Oxford\u2019s River Cherwell but we can guarantee they\u2019re not nearly as much fun as punting. There\u2019s a knack to it, using a huge, heavy pole to push off the river bed, propel and steer the boat by dragging it through the water. Whoever is not in charge can lie back, sip on a glass of bubbly and soak up the city views\u2026 while trying not to laugh. Punt hire at the central Magdalen Bridge Boathouse costs from \u00a322-24 an hour, extra if you want to employ a \u2018punter\u2019.\n\nPack a picnic\n\nSeek out the 18th-century Covered Market for hunks of cheese, crusty bread and a bag full of warm-from-the-oven Ben\u2019s Cookies (now nationwide but they started right here). Then wander into Oxford Botanic Garden (Philip Pullman fans can spot the bench where His Dark Materials\u2019 characters Lyra and Will say goodbye for the last time), or Christ Church Meadow, or bag a spot by the river in University Parks.\n\nMake for a museum\n\nOxford is blessed with many rainy \u2013 or even not so rainy \u2013 day options. There are museums for every interest, and many are free to visit (donations welcomed), including the wonderful Ashmolean for its art and antiquities \u2013 from drawings by Michelangelo to the lantern that Guy Fawkes carried and a death mask of Oliver Cromwell.\n\nThe Oxford University Museum of Natural History appeals to families, with its dinosaur, dodo and whale skeletons and regularly changing exhibitions. Visitors here should not miss the adjoining Pitt Rivers Museum, the personal collection of a Victorian explorer. It\u2019s gloriously quirky and full of just the kind of things kids love to ogle \u2013 think shrunken heads from South America and reindeer knickers from Siberia (made from reindeer skin, not worn by reindeer, in case you\u2019re wondering).\n\nModern Art Oxford offers a culturally diverse and exciting mix of contemporary art, films, music and performances.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nGuests don\u2019t mind doing time at Malmaison Oxford. Set in a former prison, original features such as the thick cell doors and window bars have been retained, but there are also soft carpets, mood lighting and all the accoutrements you\u2019d expect from a four-star hotel. Doubles from \u00a3139, room only.\n\nThe Head of the River is an atmospheric pub with a huge outdoor terrace and bar and fabulous rooms. It\u2019s on the banks of the River Thames but only a few minutes\u2019 walk into Oxford city centre. Doubles from \u00a3144, B&B.\n\nStay in the university colleges and buildings and feel several (hundred) IQ points higher by association. Prices start from around \u00a340 per night for a single room, B&B, but increase according to the location and popularity of the college and facilities available.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nA great lunch or afternoon tea spot with glorious views is the light and airy Rooftop Restaurant at the Ashmolean Museum.\n\nYou can buy food and drink at Thirsty Meeples Caf\u00e9, but the real focus in on board games. There are more than 2,500 to choose from and if you get stuck with the rules, the Game Guru will come to your rescue.\n\nFor dinner, The Parsonage Grill at The Old Parsonage Hotel is an institution. It has an intimate, boho feel, with moody colours and oil paintings of Oxford luminaries gracing the walls. Food is simple and classic.\n\nAfter a night out on the town, Gee\u2019s is a good place to sip on a Bloody Mary in a plant filled Victorian conservatory and enjoy something from the all-day brunch menu.\n\nMany of Oxford\u2019s most interesting restaurants are just outside the city centre. In Summertown, Pompette dishes up French delights and The Oxford Kitchen has the city\u2019s only Michelin star, with tasting menus that positively sparkle. Kazbar, on the Cowley Road, offers interesting Moroccan/Spanish fusion tapas. Oli\u2019s Thai, a little further out and off the same road, serves up the best food this side of Bangkok at bargain prices.\n\nWhere to drink\n\nIf the walls could tell stories, then the Eagle & Child pub would be the chattiest in the land. It was here that J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis used to meet up for a beer and a chinwag in hobbit sized snugs.\n\nThomas Hardy preferred the Lamb & Flag on St Giles Street and wrote Jude the Obscure here. Incidentally, by drinking in this pub you are helping fund needy students at St John\u2019s College.\n\nCocktails more your scene? Raoul\u2019s Bar and Liquor Store in the trendy Jericho area of the city offers more varieties than you could shake a swizzle stick at with many good enough to eat \u2013 like the delicious sounding White Chocolate Martini or Popcorn Cream Soda.\n\nHappy hour is always just that at The House, where you can sit on a Philippe Starck sofa on the outdoor terrace and feel like you\u2019ve wandered into the pages of a home interiors magazine.\n\nWhere to shop\n\nBookworms will be in literal literary heaven at Blackwell\u2019s \u2013 the Norrington Room at the city\u2019s original Broad Street branch has over three miles of bookshelves to browse. There are, unsurprisingly, plenty of other bookshops around Oxford, including two specialist Oxfam stores.\n\nThe \u00a3440m Westgate Oxford shopping centre opened in 2017, bringing many high street names to the city.\n\nOxford is awash with creativity, so there is a thriving indie shop scene, too, from custom jeweller FTE Metalworks, to ethical coffee makers New Ground.\n\nBicester Village is a few miles outside the city and home to designer names like Chlo\u00e9 and Gucci at slashed prices.\n\nNuts and Bolts\n\nPublic transport\n\nOxford is a small city so it\u2019s easy to walk. There\u2019s a good bus service and one of the many open top bus tours is good for getting an idea of what\u2019s where. Or, make like the students by getting on your bike. Dockless cycles, such as those by Mobike, are a good option, especially when you can pick up and drop off at any point.\n\nBest view\n\nThe Carfax Tower (\u00a32.70 entry) is often heralded for the sweeping vistas afforded after climbing to the top. It\u2019s the tallest building in the city at 23m high (a law actually decrees that nothing in the centre can be built above it). But for our money, the view from the top of the University Church of St Mary (\u00a34) just pips it, with glimpses into almost every major college as well as other city beauties. Bonus \u2013 if you go to St Mary\u2019s Passage, around the back of the church, you can see the beautifully ornate door and lamp post that were thought to have given C. S. Lewis the idea for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\n\nInsider tip\n\nMost visitors admire the Bodleian Library from afar. Book a tour to see the extraordinary medieval Duke Humfrey\u2019s Library and Divinity School here (and expect another treat for Potter fans as they starred as the Hogwarts Library and Infirmary respectively). A 30-minute tour costs \u00a36.", "description": "The Independent\u2019s hotel recommendations are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
