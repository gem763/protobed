It was unclear if the new disclosure would change the thinking of any of the parties that agreed to the settlement.\n\nThe attorneys general of a majority of states, including New York and Massachusetts, have already balked at the proposed deal, contending that the Sackler family has siphoned off company profits that should be used to pay for the billions of dollars in damage caused by opioids.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Health Sacklers-Purdue-Opioids.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
