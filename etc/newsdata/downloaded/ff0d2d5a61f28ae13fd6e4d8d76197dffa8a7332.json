The EU is specifically concerned with the country's structural balance, which excludes one-off revenues and expenditures.\n\nThe draft budget \"plans a change in the structural balance in 2020 amounting to a worsening by 0.1% of GDP (gross domestic product),\" the Commission said in the letter.\n\nThe Italian government had previously agreed to improve its structural balance by 0.6% of its GDP in 2020.\n\nThe Commission also asked Italy why its net primary expenditure \u2014 which does not include interest payments \u2014 is expected to grow by 1.9% next year, instead of falling by 0.1%.\n\nThis is not the first time that the EU has raised concerns about Italy's fiscal path. With the previous Italian government, which came to power in June 2018, the European Commission demanded stronger fiscal responsibility twice. The long-standing conflict between Rome and Brussels during those two periods caused market turmoil and a spike in Italian bond yields.\n\nItaly changed government during the summer and a new leadership was sworn in by September. The current coalition is now formed by the Five Star Movement (M5S), which promotes initiatives that would extend social benefits for citizens, and Partito Democratico (PD), which criticizes both the trade unions and the banking industry.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Italian government bond traded higher on Tuesday morning.", "description": "The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, is grappling once again with Italy's spending plans.", "authors": ["Silvia Amaro"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106195345-1571743771576gettyimages-1174361937.jpeg?v=1571743793", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
