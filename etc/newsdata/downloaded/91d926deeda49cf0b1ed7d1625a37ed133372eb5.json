It has one of the world's highest inflation rates, running at 22% during the first half of the year.\n\nArgentina's economy contracted by 5.8% in the first quarter of 2019, after shrinking 2.5% last year. Three million people have fallen into poverty over the past year.\n\nHow is the move likely to be received?\n\nOrdinary Argentines have traditionally had little faith in their own currency, preferring to convert their spare pesos into dollars as soon as they can.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThey don't trust financial institutions much either, so they resort to what is locally known as the \"colch\u00f3n bank\" - that is, stuffing their dollars under the mattress.\n\nAnecdotal stories abound of people keeping money buried in the garden, hidden in the walls or even stuffed in heating systems - occasionally with disastrous consequences if there is an unexpected cold snap.\n\nWhen you consider Argentina's history of rampant inflation and currency volatility, they arguably have a point.\n\nBut it does mean that any restrictions on people's ability to buy dollars have an enormous psychological impact.\n\nHow does this compare with previous crisis measures?\n\nThe $10,000 ceiling for dollar transactions is certainly generous in comparison with past actions.\n\nPeople still have bad memories of the \"corralito\", imposed in 2001, which stopped all withdrawals of dollars from bank accounts for a whole year.\n\nThe only serious attempt to wean Argentines off their dollar dependency dates back to the 1990s under President Carlos Menem, when the peso's value was fixed by law at parity with the dollar.\n\nBut that put the financial system under severe strain, leading to the economic meltdown of 2001-02.\n\nHow bad can Argentina's crisis get?\n\nThe country is struggling to stave off its fifth debt default in 30 years.\n\nLast week, it said it would seek to restructure its debt with the IMF by extending its maturity. This would give the country more time to pay back the money it owes to the IMF.\n\nRating agencies, including Standard & Poor's and Fitch, decided that amounted to a default and downgraded the country's credit ratings.\n\nWhatever happens in Argentina, the risk of financial contagion is low, say analysts.\n\nEven in the rest of Latin America, markets are unlikely to suffer. The US-China trade war and the slowdown in global growth are much more of a threat.", "description": "Firms will have to seek central bank permission to buy foreign currency and make bank transfers abroad.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11109/production/_108579896_arg_afp.jpg"}
