The president and chief executive has resigned. (Ben Margot/AP)\n\nDevin Wenig, eBay\u2019s president and chief executive, has resigned as the online retailer pursues an extensive review of its business and weighs whether to sell more of its assets, the company announced Wednesday.\n\nWenig, a former Reuters CEO, joined eBay in 2011 and had held the top job since July 2015. The company\u2019s chief financial officer, Scott Schenkel, will serve as interim CEO while the board searches for a permanent replacement.\n\n\u201cIn the past few weeks it became clear that I was not on the same page as my new Board,\u201d Wenig said Wednesday in a posting on Twitter. \u201cWhenever that happens, its best for everyone to turn that page over. It has been an incredible privilege to lead one of the worlds great businesses for the past 8 years.\u201d\n\nHe did not elaborate on the differences.\n\nThomas Tierney, the board chairman, praised Wenig as a \u201ctireless advocate for driving improvement\u201d in a statement. \u201cIndeed, eBay is stronger today than it was four years ago. Notwithstanding this progress, given a number of considerations, both Devin and the Board believe that a new CEO is best for the Company at this time.\u201d\n\nEBay was founded in 1995 as a snail-mail business before evolving into a pioneer of e-commerce. But the company struggled to maintain its dominance amid rising competition, particularly from Amazon, despite efforts to revamp its image and modernize. Its shares were down more than 2.3 percent Wednesday after Wenig\u2019s departure was announced.\n\nAs Amazon expanded its behemoth third-party platform, which now makes up the bulk of Amazon\u2019s retail sales, eBay has languished; Amazon\u2019s 2018 revenue in North America was 13 times eBay\u2019s total revenue. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nIn October, eBay sued Amazon, accusing it of poaching its sellers as \u201cpart of a larger pattern of aggressive, unscrupulous conduct.\u201d The suit was eventually sent to arbitration.\n\nIn January, activist investors at Elliot Management sent eBay\u2019s board a letter criticizing the company\u2019s poor performance, compared with its peers and outlining a plan to usher eBay into a new era of profitability. The letter called for a review of its assets and \u201cincreasing operational efficiency,\u201d among other recommendations, and stressed that leadership would be key in enacting changes.\n\nIn March, eBay said it would undergo restructuring, lay off some employees and begin a \u201cstrategic review\u201d of assets, including online ticket marketplace StubHub and eBay Classifieds Group. The review will continue with assistance from Goldman Sachs, the company said in a news release.\n\nSchenkel, the interim chief executive, is a former General Electric executive who oversaw eBay Marketplace for several years before being named chief financial officer in 2015.\n\n\u201cDuring his 12 years at eBay, Scott has demonstrated that he is a strong and dynamic leader who knows our business inside and out,\u201d Tierney, the board chairman, said in a statement. \u201cHe has worked closely with our teams across the Company to execute our strategy. We are confident that Scott\u2019s experience at eBay positions him well to lead the Company during this time.\u201d\n\nAndy Cring, eBay\u2019s vice president of global financial planning, will step in as interim chief financial officer.\n\nDuring his tenure as chief executive, Wenig spearheaded efforts to modernize eBay and court younger shoppers, including a site redesign and the implementation of artificial intelligence for shopper insights. But some attempts to refashion eBay made it less appealing to core users, while failing to change public perception of the company as an auctioning platform, first and foremost.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to please two user bases at once: they want a more modern experience, which has been helpful for new users ... but for the core user base, people who know how to operate the site and find deals that they want, it\u2019s been very hard to sell this change to them,\u201d said Ygal Arounian, an e-commerce analyst with Wedbush Securities.\n\nit stands for economic democracy, and has a culture and community that are examples of how technology can enable, empower, and bring us together. I will be forever grateful for having been given the honor to lead this special place. and I will always, always, be in @ebay's corner \u2014 Devin Wenig (@devinwenig) September 25, 2019\n\nOn Twitter, Wenig praised eBay as a pioneer of responsible big tech.\n\n\u201cEBay is an example of why we shouldn\u2019t give up on big tech companies,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt stands for economic democracy, and has a culture and community that are examples of how technology can enable, empower and bring us together. \u2026 I will always, always be in eBay\u2019s corner.\"", "description": "Chief Financial Officer Scott Schenkel will serve as interim CEO while the board searches for a permanent replacement.", "authors": ["Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "September At Pm", "Taylor Telford Is A Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DP5eYriSmsgnsvjxuf88QwOl3pk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SWPICGR4FQI6TMIL6BNCFZ2YMU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
