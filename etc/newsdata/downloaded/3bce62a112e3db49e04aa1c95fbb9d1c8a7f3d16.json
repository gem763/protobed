China denied the charge of meddling and said Hong Kong is an internal affair.\n\nThe rating agency said it expects Hong Kong's financial buffers to remain intact, although it anticipates that the region's revenue will underperform budget forecast.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)", "description": "Hong Kong's rating outlook is negative, Fitch Ratings said in its statement.
