Phosphorous made \u201cmore than 2,700 attempts to identify consumer email accounts belonging to specific Microsoft customers and then attack 241 of those accounts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe targeted accounts are associated with a U.S. presidential campaign, current and former U.S. government officials, journalists covering global politics and prominent Iranians living outside Iran.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s announcement comes as the presidential campaign heats up amid concerns the 2020 election faces the same dangers as the Russian hacking and social-media effort in 2016.\n\n\u201cWhile the attacks we\u2019re disclosing today were not technically sophisticated, they attempted to use a significant amount of personal information both to identify the accounts belonging to their intended targets and in a few cases to attempt attacks,\u201d Burt said in the post. \u201cThis effort suggests Phosphorous is highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering.\u201d\n\nReuters and the New York Times reported that President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign was targeted in an attack by Iranian hackers, citing people familiar with the issue. \u201cWe have no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted,\u201d Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign communications director, said in a statement to Bloomberg.\n\nCyber-attacks during the 2016 election included the targeting of personal email. It\u2019s unclear if the \u201cconsumer email accounts,\u201d highlighted by Microsoft are personal or official campaign accounts that would be considered part of a campaign\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nSpokesmen for the campaigns of Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders declined to comment. The campaign of Democrat Kamala Harris has \u201cno indication\u201d it was the organization referenced by Microsoft, Ian Sams, a campaign spokesman, said. Other major presidential campaigns couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee received an alert about the cyber-attack from Microsoft and warned the campaigns of its presidential candidates, according to an email obtained by Bloomberg News. \u201cAs always, please be sure everyone in the organization has completed the DNC Device and Account Security Checklist and that your organization is incorporating our top 10 list for running an effective security program,\u201d the committee wrote in its email.\n\nThe campaigns were asked to tell the DNC if they \u201chave seen any trace of this actor\u201d so the committee could track investigations into the hack.\n\nThe Phosphorous group has previously targeted dissidents, activists, the defense industry, journalists and government employees in the U.S. and Middle East, according to Microsoft. The company announced in March it had taken successful court action against Phosphorous and seized 99 websites from the hackers, preventing them from using the pages for cyber-operations.\n\nCybersecurity company FireEye Inc. has seen a spike in Phosphorous activity in the U.S. and Middle East since the summer, said John Hultquist, the company\u2019s director of intelligence and analysis.\n\n\u201cWhile we suspect that a lot of this activity is about collecting intelligence, Iran has a history of carrying out destructive attacks,\u201d Hultquist said. Phosphorous, known by FireEye as APT 35, is \u201cone of a handful of Iranian actors that we\u2019ve seen actively carrying out large scale, noisy intrusion attempts,\u201d which have taken place in countries including the U.S., Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, he said.\n\nIn July, Microsoft announced it had countered almost 10,000 hacks globally stemming from state-sponsored attacks in the previous 12 months. The effort included hundreds of attacks on democracy-focused groups, particularly non-governmental organizations and think tanks, which were mostly based in the U.S., the company said.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- An Iranian-government linked group of computer hackers tried to infiltrate email accounts of a U.S. presidential campaign, current and former U.S. officials and journalists, among others, Microsoft Corp. said.Four accounts, though none connected to the unnamed presidential campaign or", "authors": ["Alyza Sebenius"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
