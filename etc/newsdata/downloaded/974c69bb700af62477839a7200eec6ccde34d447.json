(ZBRA) was favored by Jim Cramer Thursday night during the Lightning Round of his popular Mad Money program. \"Zebra keeps doing great and I'm a believer,\" said Cramer. Let's visit with the charts to see how great the stock price has been.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of ZBRA, below, we can see that prices have formed what looks like a five-month triangle formation. Prices have traded sideways in a narrowing pattern with smaller and smaller high/low swings.\n\nTrading volume declined through the pattern, which is typical because as the swings get shorter the odds of making money decline and trading volume goes elsewhere. The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line declines slightly suggesting that sellers are slightly more aggressive. The trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has been hugging the zero line which is not surprising because prices have gone nowhere for months.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of ZBRA, below, we can see that investors in ZBRA have done well the past three years. Prices are above the cresting 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is steady and the MACD oscillator is holding above the zero line. An upside breakout in price will turn the oscillator to the upside for a fresh buy signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of ZBRA, below, we can see that the software is projecting an upside breakout and a potential price target in the $238 area.\n\nBottom-line strategy: ZBRA could break out to the upside at any moment. Buy a starter position now and when prices start to move up add the balance of what you want to buy. Risk a close below $185 and $238 is the first target.", "description": "Zebra Technologies' Stripes Are Bullish and Ready to Break Out...ZBRA", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Zebra Technologies' Stripes Are Bullish", "Ready To Break Out", "Shares Of The Cloud Name Could Break Out To The Upside At Any Moment.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/dcb7f92f-0397-11e9-86d7-0f3a395c3013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
