Before the news, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials were in positive territory.\n\nFor months, Wall Street has bounced up and down with signs of improvement or deterioration in trade talks, often based on comments or tweets from Trump, a cycle investors have grown accustomed to.\n\n\u201cIn this case, it\u2019s a bit more concerning because it\u2019s China making the decision, rather than Trump,\u201d said Willie Delwiche, markets strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.\n\nTrade optimism in recent weeks helped elevate the S&P 500 .SPX to just shy of its all-time high hit in July.\n\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors fell on Friday. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD and tariff-sensitive S&P 500 information technology index .SPLRCT declined the most, down 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively. The Philadelphia chip index .SOX slid 1.8%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 0.59% to end the week at 26,934.46 points, while the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.49% to 2,991.99.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 0.8% to 8,117.67.\n\nFor the week, the S&P 500 fell 0.52%, the Dow lost 1.05% and the Nasdaq declined 0.72%.\n\nNetflix tumbled 5.5% after CEO Reed Hastings made comments underscoring growing costs and rising competition from Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and other video streaming services.\n\nAdding to Netflix\u2019s woes, Evercore ISI said recent data painted an uncertain picture of the company\u2019s international subscriber growth.\n\nThe S&P 500 healthcare index .SPXHC, which has been the worst performing S&P sector this year, clocked the biggest gain among the 11 major sectors, up 0.6%.\n\nMerck & Co (MRK.N) gained 1.4% after the company\u2019s drugs Pifeltro and Delstrigo received FDA approval for use in certain adult patients with HIV-1 who are \u201cvirally suppressed.\u201d\n\nRoku Inc (ROKU.O) slumped 19.2% after Pivotal Research started coverage of its shares with a \u201csell\u201d rating.\n\nXilinx Inc (XLNX.O) dropped 6.8% after Chief Financial Officer Lorenzo Flores said he would step down, prompting Bank of America Merrill to downgrade the chipmaker to \u201cneutral.\u201d\n\nA Wall St. street sign is seen near the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 17, 2019.
