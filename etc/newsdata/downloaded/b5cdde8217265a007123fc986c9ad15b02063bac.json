To be fair last year wasn\u2019t his team,\u2019 Winterburn told Gambling.com.\n\n\u2018Now he\u2019s had significant funds this season to make those changes. He\u2019s brought in younger players which I agree with. But I would think that if Arsenal don\u2019t get into the top four there will be a review.\n\nUnai Emery is under pressure in north London (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018They can\u2019t get into the same position as with Arsene Wenger where 50 per cent of the supporters want him to stay and the other 50 per cent want him out and every time something goes wrong on the pitch it\u2019s almost as if the supporters are in crisis with each other.\u2019\n\nWinterburn is already considering who should replace Emery in the hot seat, and feels that a former players is the right way to go.\n\nHe sees current Arsenal coach Freddie Ljungberg and Manchester City coach Mikel Arteta as options, but feels that former captain Vieira is the most interesting option.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know if they would be as brave to go with someone like Ljungberg or Arteta. They may be terrific coaches but when you take that manager\u2019s role it steps up another couple of levels again.\n\n\u2018I would say keep an eye on what\u2019s happening with Patrick Vieira. If someone like that could prove they are able to run a club in the right way, then Arsenal may look towards that eventually.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVieira is currently in charge of Ligue 1 side Nice, taking over in June last year and enjoying a solid first season in charge, finishing seventh.\n\nHowever, the current campaign is not going especially well for the World Cup winner, with three straight Ligue 1 defeats leaving Nice 15th in the table.\n\nMORE: Jose Mourinho open to replacing Unai Emery as Arsenal manager\n\nMORE: Arsenal decide against disciplining Granit Xhaka due to his \u2018fragile\u2019 mental health", "description": "Arsenal cannot let Unai Emery go the same way as Arsene Wenger and should be considering Patrick Vieira as a potential replacement, believes club legend Nigel Winterburn.
