Over the weekend, her presidential campaign purposefully ran an ad promoting a false claim that Zuckerberg endorsed President Trump Donald John TrumpDemocratic senator rips Trump's 'let them fight' remarks: 'Enough is enough' Warren warns Facebook may help reelect Trump 'and profit off of it' Trump touts Turkey cease-fire: 'Sometimes you have to let them fight' MORE, pointing out that the company faces challenges in restricting misinformation on the site.\n\n\u201cBreaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,\u201d Warren\u2019s campaign wrote in the Facebook advertisement, which featured a picture of President Trump and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shaking hands. \u201cYou\u2019re probably shocked, and you might be thinking, \u2018How could this possibly be true?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not,\u201d the advertisement reads. \u201cBut what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform \u2014 and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\u201d\n\nBut Zuckerberg has defended Facebook\u2019s controversial decision to allow politicians to post ads with misleading or false claims, saying it is \u201csomething we have to live with.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople worry, and I worry deeply, too, about an erosion of truth,\u201d Zuckerberg told The Washington Post before a speech at Georgetown University. \u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t think people want to live in a world where you can only say things that tech companies decide are 100 percent true. And I think that those tensions are something we have to live with.\u201d\n\nHe continued to defend the policy during the speech, saying that the company had considered banning all political ads, but they rejected that approach because they can be \u201can important part of voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolitical ads on Facebook are more transparent than anywhere else,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe don\u2019t factcheck political ads \u2026 because we believe people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying.\"\n\n\u201cI know many people disagree, but in general I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy. And we are not an outlier here.\u201d\n\nFacebook also came under fire after Trump\u2019s reelection campaign released an advertisement accusing former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenWarren warns Facebook may help reelect Trump 'and profit off of it' Trump accuses Biden of 'quid pro quo' hours after Mulvaney remarks Testimony from GOP diplomat complicates Trump defense MORE, without evidence, of using his office to pressure Ukrainian officials to end an investigation into a company on which his son, Hunter Biden, sat on the board.
