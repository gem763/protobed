Expecting a lot of carnival colour, I wasn\u2019t disappointed by the time we got to the showstopper.\n\nAlice has spent the week marking, on top of her bake off prep. I\u2019ll be impressed if she can whisk after all of that \u2013 I get cramp writing my shopping list!\n\nThings kicked off with an Easter favourite: hot cross buns. I may have misheard Prue and thought we were getting unicorn hot cross buns\u2026 turns out she said uniform. Bit of a shame.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve seen Prue and Paul linger in the background, like exam invigilators.\n\nThere\u2019s more dodgy camera work this week too, with a zoom on the buns in the oven through the legs of a mystery baker. I was trying to identify the baker by their buns and I think it might have been David.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a relief to see this episode seems to have settled back down; the judges are cheerier, the bakes are going well, this is much easier viewing than last week.\n\nWhen it came down to the bun judging, somehow Prue cheerfully saying Alice\u2019s bakes \u2018look homemade\u2019 sounded like a backhanded compliment.\n\nThe bakers are looking like meerkats during this challenge, with heads popping up and down from counter to oven every couple of minutes (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nI certainly didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be saying \u2018I want Henry\u2019s buns\u2019 out loud, but Paul apparently also wants them, gifting him with his first, very well deserved handshake. Yes, shut up.\n\nNext up in the tent were Sicilian Cassatelle and they look delicious. I\u2019ve never heard of them but I really want to try one now and it\u2019s enjoyable to learn about new bakes. Also, hands up anyone who\u2019s ever sieved cheese? Anyone? No? That\u2019s what I thought.\n\nWe\u2019ve been missing some good presenter/ baker interaction so it was nice to see Sandi taking her time to give the time\u2019s up order to Michael and helping Henry in his pasta rolling.\n\nI felt for the bakers during the technical judging \u2013 aside from the occasional burst Cassatelle, they all looked genuinely pleased with themselves for creating something they\u2019ve never eaten before. Yet Paul and Prue proceeded to pick them apart swiftly and sharply.\n\nThe world\u2019s worst ever game of Hide and Seek. #GBBO pic.twitter.com/oirTyzerzt \u2014 British Bake Off (@BritishBakeOff) October 8, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey didn\u2019t have time to dwell though, with Sarawak layer cake making me glad I didn\u2019t have it as a showstopper when I was in the tent. It\u2019s full of layers, fried layer at a time, deconstructed and then reassembled and traditionally served in Malaysia on special occasions.\n\nDescribed as a complicated battenberg, this is a bake that requires lots of advanced planning and mapping out. It wasn\u2019t until I went to culinary school that I appreciated the importance of cracking out pen and paper and carefully crafting a plan of action before starting.\n\nThe bakers are looking like meerkats during this challenge, with heads popping up and down from counter to oven every couple of minutes.\n\nThere\u2019s something a little unnerving about Paul staring into your eyes while taking a bite of your bake.\n\nI\u2019m really impressed with their showstoppers, they\u2019re not flawless but they\u2019re beautifully put together and for four hours 15 mins of tent time, they\u2019ve done really well. It\u2019s nice to see our bakers being truly tested and having them rise to the occasion.\n\nHenry got his second handshake this week, this time earning a comedy handshake from Sandi \u2013 the boy is on a roll and then goes and gets himself awarded star baker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately it\u2019s also time to say goodbye to another baker. I\u2019m sad to see Michael go, he\u2019s been great to have in the tent. He does go out on the best quote so far though: \u2018I wish I was a pretty crier, like in a black and white French film.\u2019\n\nAnd with that ladies and gents, we\u2019ll be heading into quarter finals next week \u2013 well timed with the rugby!\n\nMORE: The Greatest Bake Off: Sandi Toksvig makes dig about Henry\u2019s \u2018girlfriend\u2019 amid Alice romance rumours\n\nMORE: The Great British Bake Off\u2019s Michael Chakraverty crashes out after tough Festival Week\n\nMORE: With such dull challenges, it\u2019s no surprise the Bake Off contestants have hit a wall", "description": "GBBO columnist Selasi Gbormittah shares his review of Bake Off's festival week.", "authors": ["Selasi Gbormittah", "Great British Bake Off Semi-Finalist"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-882082934_1570618651.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
