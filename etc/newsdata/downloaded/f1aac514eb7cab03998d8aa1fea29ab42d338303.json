I express condolences to his family and colleagues.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mr. Biggs criticized House Democrats for continuing with their impeachment inquiry this week while cutting short floor action.\n\n\u201cIt is terribly disrespectful that Chairman Schiff could not find a warm spot in his heat to delay his rush to impeach the President for even a single day so that we might all reflect on Chairman Cummings, his life, and things that are bigger than any of us,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDemocrats mourned their colleague on Monday, who, in part of his iconic legacy in Congress, was a central pillar in their impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe Oversight committee is investigating the Trump administration on several fronts, including whether President Trump pressured Ukraine to open an investigation into the Biden family and allegations of 2016 election interference.\n\n\u201cWe will proceed with what we are doing, as he would want us to do,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi told her members in a closed-door hearing, according to a Politico report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
