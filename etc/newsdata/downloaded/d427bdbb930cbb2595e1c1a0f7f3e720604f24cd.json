According to an expert, talking to them and showing that you care will help calm them down.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Form Six student from De La Salle Secondary School N. T., in Sheung Shui, was charged with wounding with intent after allegedly slashing a sergeant\u2019s neck with a box cutter during Sunday\u2019s anti-government protests in Kwun Tong.\n\nThe charge carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and the case was heard in the Eastern Magistrates\u2019 Courts on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nPolice officer slashed in neck, another drop-kicked during 19th straight weekend of demonstrations\n\nLocal media also reported that the police found the 18-year-old student\u2019s will at his home.\n\nDr Wan Lap-man, the supervisor of Services for Youth at Risk at Hong Kong Playground Association, said the student might be overly caught up in the social movement. Given the facts, Wan suspected that the student was suffering from depression and saw no hope for the future.\n\n\u201cThe cognitive thinking of people who already suffer from mental health conditions could be twisted,\u201d said Wan, a registered social worker. \u201cFor example, they might perceive things in [completely different ways]. Their analytical thinking could also turn very radical.\u201d\n\nFace off: Should we talk about politics in schools?\n\nIn the current situation, Wan said such people might become pessimistic about their current social conditions and move towards the \u201cgive me liberty or give me death\u201d mentality.\n\n\u201cWhen emotions take over a person, their decision-making would be affected,\u201d Wan added. \u201cAlthough we can\u2019t be sure about the 18-year-old student\u2019s intentions now, the act and consequences of slashing the policeman in the neck might not be thoroughly considered.\u201d\n\nWan pointed out that a dangerous situation may arise from the incident.\n\nStudents at Hong Kong Design Institute vandalise campus, demanding surveillance footage of classmate found dead in sea\n\n\u201cSome students might consider the 18-year-old as a hero and glorify his actions and even call him a martyr. For those who already share the same mentality as this student, they might start imitating his actions.\u201d\n\nWan said people should try to calm their aggressive friends down, perhaps by trying to discuss whether it really would be the end of the world if the five protester demands aren\u2019t met.\n\nThere have been and will continue to be, though, critical moments, where talking things out isn\u2019t possible. At those times, Wan suggests simply asking them to calm down.\n\nMental health in Hong Kong amid ongoing protest is at an all-time low but there is help\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t help if you preach, or [try to] analyse the whole situation with them in great detail,\u201d Wan said. \u201cThere\u2019s simply no room for that [kind of] discussion. Instead, we need to remind them that there\u2019s a way out.\u201d\n\nDe La Salle has said it will not expel the student who attacked the officer.\n\n\u201cIt is a serious case, and our teachers and students are all very upset and concerned after learning of his arrest,\u201d De La Salle\u2019s vice-principal, Poon Man-yiu, said.\n\nIs your mental health suffering? It might be compassion fatigue\n\n\u201cBut I believe the school\u2019s priority right now is to offer help and support to him and his family, and to remind students to stay away from dangerous public events at this tense time in our society.\u201d\n\nPoon said school staff had visited the student at Tseung Kwan O Police Station on Sunday night, where he was still detained.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the injured sergeant is in a stable condition at United Christian Hospital in Kwun Tong.\n\nEdited by M.
