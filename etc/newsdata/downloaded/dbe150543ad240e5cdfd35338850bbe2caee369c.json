That was the feeling of an Australian woman who sued her neighbor for barbecuing in their own backyard.\n\nCilla Carden, a vegan massage therapist from Girrawheen\u2014a suburb of the Western Australian city of Perth, believed that her neighbors were using a barbecue as a new front in a long-running war between neighbors. \u201cThey\u2019ve put [the barbecue] there so I smell fish, all I can smell is fish. I can\u2019t enjoy my back yard, I can\u2019t go out there,\u201d Carden told Nine News Perth.\n\nCarden believes the barbecuing is not just a family preparing their supper, but part of a campaign to irritate her, which is why she filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the state of Western Australia, claiming that her neighbors, Toan Vu and his wife and children, breached residential laws. \u201cIt\u2019s deliberate, that\u2019s what I told the courts, it\u2019s deliberate,\u201d she said in the local news interview.\n\nWhile Carden claims all she \u201cwanted\u2026is to live my life in peace,\u201d the lawsuit she filed also alleged that it was more than just the smell of grilling fish that was disturbing her. She also took issue with cigarette smoke in their garden, because the fumes waft over into her yard. She is also frustrated by the sound of the neighbors\u2019 children playing basketball and making noise in the yard. The legal saga has dragged on since August 2017, according to The Guardian.\n\nWhile Carden sought relief from the onslaught of smells and noise in the courts, her case was thrown out by a tribunal and a Supreme Court judge who sided with the neighbors. \u201cWhat they are doing is living in their backyard and their home as a family,\u201d said the State Administrative Tribunal of Western Australia, according to the Evening Standard.\n\nCarden wasn\u2019t ready to give up yet, though, and filed an appeal. That too was dismissed by the court. While Carden may not be satisfied with the outcome of her legal case, according to Australia\u2019s News, her neighbor removed the barbecue from his yard and banned his children from playing basketball. Carden, though, plans to continue her legal fight.", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s deliberate, that\u2019s what I told the courts, it\u2019s deliberate,\u201d the vegan said in a local news interview.", "authors": ["Melissa Locker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IhtVtJTt5LLeBb5XrqqC4g--~B/aD0xNDE0O3c9MjEyMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/d7ae23fa5a7c3cf2b2e3fdfba4c14807"}
