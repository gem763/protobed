Ayotzinapa is where the students' all-male college is located.\n\nOfficials added they had conducted nine searches since June to find traces of the trainee teachers, and would call Jesus Murillo, the attorney general who oversaw the Pena Nieto-era probe into the disappearances, to make declarations next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nPROBE 'DISCREDITED'\n\nLopez Obrador took office in December pledging to re-open the case. His government has called the original probe into the crime \"discredited\" and vowed to go after the officials who led it.\n\nAngela Buitrago, a consultant named by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights who is helping to oversee the new probe, said it was vital to investigate military officials who were present in Iguala five years ago.\n\nLopez Obrador said in December that military officials should also be put under the spotlight, but it is not clear what questions, if any, they have so far faced.\n\nAccording to the Pena Nieto administration's account, local drug gang Guerreros Unidos mistook the students for members of a rival outfit, killed them, incinerated their bodies in a nearby garbage dump and tipped their remains into a river.\n\nHowever, the remains of only one of the 43 was ever definitively identified, and a group of independent experts later picked several holes in the official version of events.\n\nThe U.N. human rights office said in a report last year that it appeared Mexican authorities had tortured dozens of people during the investigation. Out of 142 suspects detained in the case, more than half have been released.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Lizbeth Diaz; Writing by Daina Beth Solomon and Delphine Schrank; Editing by Sandra Maler and Pravin Char)", "description": "Scores of local government officials from 31 U.S. states pressured McDonald's Corp's on Thursday to do a better job of protecting workers from groping, obscene comments and other forms of sexual harassment, adding their voices to an employee-led campaign that has seen walkouts at several stores", "authors": ["Lizbeth Diaz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CDLtUpjVoyZrYGlnEd1ZsA--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/9766ca7e9d13dfbbd730607cd0dadf68", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
