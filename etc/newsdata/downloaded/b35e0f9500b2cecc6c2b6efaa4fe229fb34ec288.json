He recognizes that people accord less weight to information that nobody bothers to conceal. If shooting someone were that big a deal, the reasoning goes, Trump wouldn\u2019t do it in full public view. The logic works even better when it comes to Trump\u2019s comments about Ukraine and China. Most Americans know murder is against the law. Whether inviting foreign meddling in an American election constitutes a \u201chigh crime or misdemeanor,\u201d by contrast, is less well established. By openly inviting such meddling, therefore, Trump sends the message that it\u2019s not that important. If it were, he\u2019d have kept his request a secret.\n\nBut brazenness entails more than just a lack of secrecy. It also entails confidence. And here too, there\u2019s ample evidence that Trump\u2019s confidence works to his political benefit.\n\nIf people use secrecy as a heuristic to gauge importance, they use confidence as a heuristic to gauge competence. As Cameron Anderson, a professor at UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, explained to me, \u201cThere is a lot of research showing that when people exhibit confidence, they come across as more competent, intelligent, skilled, and so forth.\u201d The word con man, the Harvard professor and former Obama-administration official Cass Sunstein has noted, is short for confidence man. That\u2019s because \u201cwhen con men succeed,\u201d Sunstein observes, \u201cit\u2019s usually because they enlist the confidence heuristic. They don\u2019t show any doubts. They act as if they know what they are doing.\u201d Thus, they win people\u2019s trust.\n\nAdam Serwer: The mad king\u2019s enablers\n\nBy openly asking Ukraine and China to investigate a political rival, Trump expressed confidence that he\u2019s doing nothing wrong. And while one might think the majority of Americans would view Trump\u2019s confidence as an outrageous sham, academic evidence suggests that con men can be surprisingly difficult to unmask. In a 2019 article in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, researchers at the University of Utah and UC Berkeley noted, \u201cPrior research is split on whether this exposure of overconfidence diminishes a person\u2019s social standing. In some studies, individuals who expressed confidence, and were later revealed to be wrong, lost credibility in the eyes of others \u2026 However, in other studies, individuals who were exposed as overconfident were not held liable.\u201d Sometimes confidence men pay a price when they are revealed to be bullshitters. Sometimes they don\u2019t.\n\nThe key, the Utah and Berkeley researchers suggest, is whether the con man retains \u201cplausible deniability\u201d in the face of evidence that he has been proved wrong. They note, for instance, that people who express confidence through nonverbal cues\u2014speaking loudly, interrupting others\u2014tend to retain their reputation for competence and good judgment better than those who express confidence through overt claims that can be clearly falsified. But even people who do make specific, falsifiable claims can maintain their plausible deniability in other ways, the researchers note\u2014for instance, by \u201cundermining the expertise or credibility of those reporting the error.\u201d", "description": "His brazen attempts to redefine the norms of acceptable conduct work for a reason.", "authors": ["Peter Beinart", "Professor Of Journalism At The City University Of New York"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX2PF5Z/facebook.jpg?1570457651", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
