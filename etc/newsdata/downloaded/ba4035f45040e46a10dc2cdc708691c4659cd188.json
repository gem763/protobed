The new holding company will be called Sibanye-Stillwater and the gold subsidiary will retain the name Sibanye Gold Limited.\n\nThe current corporate structure of Sibanye Gold has the current South African gold assets at holding company level.\n\nWith the growth of the company the platinum group metals (PGMs) acquisitions of Aquarius, Rustenburg Platinum, Stillwater and more recently Lonmin have been incorporated as subsidiaries of the holding company.\n\n\"To ensure structural flexibility and efficiency it is deemed appropriate to have the gold assets included as a subsidiary of the holding company,\" Sibanye states in an announcement made on Friday.\n\nThe transaction entails that Sibanye-Stillwater will acquire all of the Sibanye Gold shares, with each shareholder receiving one Sibanye-Stillwater share for each Sibanye Gold share.\n\n\n\nSibanye Gold will then become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sibanye-Stillwater.\n\nThe Sibanye-Stillwater shares will be listed on the main board of the JSE and the Sibanye Gold shares will be delisted.\n\nSibanye Stillwater's local gold mines reported a R2.9bn loss (before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) following a lengthy strike.
