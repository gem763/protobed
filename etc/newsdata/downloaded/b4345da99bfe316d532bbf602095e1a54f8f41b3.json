Gregus perfectly slotted the ball ahead to Toye, who left-footed it into the top far corner from a difficult angle just outside keeper box.\n\nToye got his sixth goal when he unleashed a high, hard shot from well outside the box into a top corner.\n\nMannone made two stops in the first half diving to his right. In the second half he made a leaping save on a free kick as LAFC put pressure on the visitors. LAFC had 24 shots, eight on target; the Loons (13-9-6) had just five shots.\n\nMinnesota coach Adrian Heath earned his 50 MLS win as his team jumped from seventh to a three-way tie for fourth in the Western Conference.\n\nLAFC (19-4-5) could have clinched the top seed in the West with a win. Its home record is now 11-1-2.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mason Toye scored twice within four minutes in the first half and Minnesota United held on to hand Los Angeles FC its first home loss of the season, 2-0 on Sunday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
