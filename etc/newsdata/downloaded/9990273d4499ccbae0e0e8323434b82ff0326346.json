Minnesota extended its major league record to 271 homers with nearly four weeks left in the season.\n\nWith Cleveland\u2019s loss to the White Sox, Minnesota extended its lead in the AL Central to seven games over the Indians. The Twins also dealt a setback to Boston\u2019s slim postseason hopes with just 24 games remaining.\n\nRafael Devers and Andrew Benintendi homered for the Red Sox, who struggled against a parade of relievers and couldn\u2019t rally all the way back after falling behind 6-0.\n\nSix Twins pitchers combined on a six-hitter, with only four hits allowed before Benintendi\u2019s two-out homer in the eighth off Taylor Rogers.\n\nRogers returned for the ninth and got his 23rd save, striking out Devers for the final out with the tying run at second.\n\nLewis Thorpe (2-1) got the win despite allowing three runs and two hits in 3 1/3 innings following opener Randy Dobnak.\n\nRick Porcello (12-11) struggled from the start, allowing one run in the first and two more in the third on Cave\u2019s triple to center. Porcello\u2019s night ended in the fifth after Cruz hit his 35th homer and San\u00f3 went deep two batters later for a two-run shot that put the Twins up 6-0. San\u00f3\u2019s shot was his 27th.\n\nPorcello allowed six runs and eight hits, walked two and hit a batter. He also struck out five over four-plus innings.\n\nThe Red Sox struck out 12 times and went 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nTwins: C Mitch Garver was out of the lineup a day after a pitch deflected off his glove and struck him in the jaw, causing him to leave a win at Detroit in the fourth inning. \u2026 Minnesota bolstered its bullpen by recalling RHPs Ryne Harper, Trevor Hildenberger and Fernando Romero from Triple-A Rochester.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTwins: RHP Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos (11-7, 3.57 ERA) faces the Red Sox for the first time since striking out 10 and holding Boston to five hits over eight innings in a 2-0 loss on June 17.\n\nRed Sox: LHP Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez (16-5, 3.97) has won his last three starts and leads Boston in victories.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nelson Cruz and Miguel San\u00f3 connected in the fifth inning to pad Minnesota's record home run total, and the Twins beat the Boston Red Sox 6-5 Tuesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Alden"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/twins_red_sox_baseball_20621_c0-100-2395-1496_s1770x1032.jpg?3991c52861e5e89a7c17b7b745e30ce3e471e909"}
