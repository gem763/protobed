TT News Agency/Henrik Montgomery/via REUTERS\n\nDUBLIN (Reuters) - It will be very difficult to secure a Brexit agreement by next week with big gaps remaining in the British position, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Tuesday following a phone call with his British counterpart, Boris Johnson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll certainly work until the very last moment to secure that (a deal) but not at any cost... I think it will be very difficult to secure an agreement by next week, quite frankly,\u201d Varadkar told Irish national broadcaster RTE.\n\n\u201cEssentially what the United Kingdom has done is repudiated the deal that we negotiated in good faith with Prime Minister May\u2019s government over two years and has sort of put half of that now back on the table and are saying that\u2019s a concession and of course it isn\u2019t really. There are two big gaps.\u201d\n\nJohnson has consistently said the United Kingdom will leave the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal, though a law passed by parliament demands he write a letter to the EU asking for a delay if he cannot strike an exit deal by Oct. 19.\n\nHe has said he would abide by the law but Britain would leave the EU by the end of the month, without explaining that contradiction. He has also repeatedly demanded an election but parliament has refused to grant one.\n\nThe European Union has accused Britain of playing a \u201cstupid blame game\u201d over Brexit after a Downing Street source said a deal was essentially impossible because German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made unacceptable demands.\n\nWith just 22 days before the United Kingdom is due to leave the bloc, the future of Brexit remains deeply uncertain as both London and Brussels position themselves to avoid blame for a delay or a disorderly no-deal Brexit.", "description": "It will be very difficult to secure a Brexit agreement by next week with big gaps remaining in the British position, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Tuesday following a phone call with his British counterpart, Boris Johnson.", "authors": ["Padraic Halpin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438720993&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971QN", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
