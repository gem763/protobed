In such situations, the result shall be allocated two points each and no score registered\".\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHowever, SRU chief executive Mark Dodson says they believe they have a case, should Typhoon Hagibis cause Sunday's crucial showdown to be cancelled.\n\n\"For World Rugby to simply state that the game has to be cancelled goes against the whole sporting integrity of the tournament,\" Dodson told BBC Radio 5live.\n\n\"World Rugby have pointed us back to the participation agreement and that it is clearly stated there. We've had a legal opinion and then we've taken a leading sports QC opinion in London that challenges that and unravels the World Rugby case.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWorld Rugby chiefs are hopeful that the game can still go ahead on Sunday.\n\nHowever Dodson remains angry by a refusal to consider moving the game to another time or venue if the worst of the storm has not passed.\n\n\"We've been preparing for this tournament now for the last four years, our guys are over 100 days in camp, we've played three games already and the fourth game in this particular case is pivotal,\" he added.\n\n\"My view is that we're not going to let Scotland be the collateral damage for a decision that was taken in haste.\"", "description": "Typhoon Hagibis has already seen the cancellation of Saturday's matches and similar on Sunday would see Scotland eliminated", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20338190.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Scotland-v-Samoa-Rugby-World-Cup-2019-Group-A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
