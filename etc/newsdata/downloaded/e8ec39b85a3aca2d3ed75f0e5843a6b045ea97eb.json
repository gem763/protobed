Raised in a Catholic family in Wauconda, a suburb of Chicago in the US state of Illinois, Bickner nurtured this vision through Catholic middle and high school; even after university she still figured she\u2019d have a large family, though her ambitions had grown more modest \u2013 perhaps just four or five kids.\n\nThen, at 23, she joined the Peace Corps in Malawi, and began seeing reasons to revise her plan.\n\n\u201cIn Malawi for four years, I got to see quite a bit of the impacts of climate change on a country that is largely subsistence farmers,\u201d says Bickner. She saw up close how changing weather patterns increasingly dictated whether or not her neighbours and friends would be able to eat \u2013 and she found herself feeling guilty over America\u2019s carbon-intensive way of life. \u201cI wanted to support policies that will help, but also wanted to see what I could do on a personal level.\u201d\n\nBickner, now 28, quickly recognised that having a child in America \u2013 let alone four, five or 13 \u2013 would be the single most carbon-intensive choice she could make. In the developed world the carbon footprint of a child is roughly 58.6 metric tonnes annually, whereas that of a Malawian child has consistently been estimated between 0.07 and 0.1 metric tonnes annually.\n\nWhile working in Malawi, and struggling with these personal questions, Bickner was also building a relationship with fellow Peace Corps member Chase Morgan. They started dating a year into their service, and now live together in Washington, DC. Bickner works as a public affairs specialist at a federal agency and Morgan works for an international development agency for energy infrastructure.", "description": "In the age of climate crisis, childbearing has become a fraught question for couples around the globe.", "authors": ["Ted Scheinman"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7n/t0/p07nt0xs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
