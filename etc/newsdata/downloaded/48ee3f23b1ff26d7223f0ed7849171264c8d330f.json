The S&P 500 index , meanwhile, gained 5.77 points to 3,010.29, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 66 points, or 0.81%, at 8,185.80.\n\nFor the week, the S&P 500 is on track to post a 0.8% weekly gain, the Nasdaq is poised for a 1.8% weekly rise while the Dow is set for a more modest 0.1% gain, as of Thursday's close.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nCorporate earnings results remain the catalyst for the stock market this week, with earnings from Intel and Amazon.com the focus.\n\nIntel (INTC) shares rose after better-than-expected earnings and revenue but Amazon (AMZN) disappointed investors with its third-quarter results (link)sending the stock down,\n\nMore than 38% of S&P 500 companies posted quarter earnings for the third quarter thus far, according to FactSet. Of those companies, 78% have beaten analyst expectations.\n\nSee: Intel stock shoots higher but one key number has analysts worried (link)\n\n\"We expect the trend in earnings results to be similar to previous quarters, where consensus reduced estimates into the reporting season, only to be revised higher as the results were out,\" J.P. Morgan Cazenove analyst Mislav Matejka wrote. \"EPS estimates for the third quarter have now fallen below Q2 2019 delivered EPS. This is way too conservative, in our view.\"\n\nSee: Amazon earnings miss is the price of growth, analysts say (link)\n\nInvestors also are closely following developments related to Britain's exit from the European Union and the status of U.S. - China trade talks as global economic growth slows.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron blocked the EU's attempt to delay Brexit for three months (link), but the European Commission said work on this would \"continue in the coming days\".\n\nMeanwhile, there is some doubt that a substantive U.S. - China trade agreement can be finalized Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials will discuss plans on Friday for China to buy more U.S. farm products, but in return, Beijing will request cancellation of some planned and existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, people briefed on the talks told Reuters (link).\n\nIn U.S. economic news, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to 95.5 in October, from 96.0. \"The economy is still in a good place consumers feel for now,\" MUFG chief economist Chris Rupkey said. \"The consumer is more than willing to go it alone if necessary when it comes to the heavy lifting of the economy that is required for growth as business investment spending weakens due to the uncertainty caused by trade war tensions.\"\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nIntel Corp. (INTC) shares rose 7% after the chip maker raised its outlook for the year (link)on Thursday evening after it posted an increase in third-quarter earnings.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (AMZN) dropped 3% on Friday after the tech giant reported a 26% fall in profit (link) late Thursday as it invested heavily to speed up shipping times.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (VZ) stock gained after an earnings beat (link). (link) The telecommunications giant added new phone subscribers and net income attributable to Verizon was $5.19 billion, up from $4.92 billion a year earlier. Quarterly revenue edged up slightly to $32.9 billion from $32.6 billion a year ago.\n\nBoeing Co.'s (BA) 737 MAX was blamed formally in the Lion Air fatal nose dive (link)into the Java Sea nearly a year ago by Indonesia investigators.\n\nHow are other markets performing?\n\nTreasury yields were little changed on Friday as a lack of fresh developments on Brexit and U.S-China trade drew investors' attention to next week's Federal Reserve meeting, where another quarter point rate cut is expected. The 10-year Treasury note yield was up 0.4 basis point to 1.770%,\n\nOil futures drifted into negative territory Friday, but remained on track for weekly gains as concerns over supply appeared to take over the spotlight from longer-term worries over global economic growth and the outlook for crude demand. West Texas Intermediate crude for December on the New York Mercantile Exchange was off 10 cents, or 0.2%, at $56.13 a barrel, but was on track for a 4.4% weekly advance after ending Thursday at a nearly one-month high.\n\nGold futures extended a gain above a key $1,500 price on Friday and looked poised to carve out a fresh near-term settlement high as investors positioned for more easing from global central banks, which could add further support for bullion. December gold on Comex gained $9.20, or 0.6%, to $1,514.20 an ounce, which would mark the highest close for the most-active contract since Oct. 4, if it holds, according to FactSet data, following a 0.6% gain for the metal on Thursday.\n\nEuropean stocks edged lower on Friday.
