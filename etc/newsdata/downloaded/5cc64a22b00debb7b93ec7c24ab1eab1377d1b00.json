We're going to continue to review the situation, have conversations with (Astros owner Jim) Crane. It's one thing to comment and investigate for 24 hours on a specific incident.\"\n\nAccording to a story Monday by Sports Illustrated's Stephanie Apstein, Taubman taunted three female reporters following the Astros' pennant-clinching win against the New York Yankees.\n\nTaubman shouted about Astros closer Robert Osuna, whom the team acquired last season while he was serving a 75-game ban for allegedly assaulting a woman. One of the reporters was wearing a purple bracelet for domestic violence awareness.\n\n\"Thank God we got Osuna!\" he yelled, according to Apstein. \"I'm so (expletive) glad we got Osuna!\"\n\nThe Astros initially called Apstein's story \"misleading\" and \"irresponsible.\"\n\nFollowing interviews of media members and Astros employees conducted over the past several days by the team and by MLB, the team admitted its mistake.\n\nManfred sounded as if the league wants to discuss with the Astros just how poorly it handled the situation from the start.\n\n\"I didn't say that there is going to be further action, but there are things we want to talk to the Astros about, continuing to have those conversations and gather information,\" Manfred said. \"I think it was important that they recognize that they had made a mistake. They issued an apology and they dealt with the individual situation in a decisive way, and those are all positives.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Just because the Houston Astros fired assistant general manager Brandon  Taubman on Thursday for inappropriate comments toward a group of female  reporters...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
