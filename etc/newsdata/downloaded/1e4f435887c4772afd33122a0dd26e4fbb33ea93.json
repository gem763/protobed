I don't even have that a month.'\n\nAnother added: 'I don't think \u00a3185 after everything is paid is poor. I must live on a different planet to some of these people'.\n\nRich House Poor House viewers were left baffled when a 'broke' family living on the minimum wage swapped lives with a multimillionaires who rent out their mansion for \u00a3800-a-night Pitctured left to right: Jack, Sian and Jason holding Oscar, standing outside the Donovans' home\n\nWhile the two families from Dorset were clearly words apart, fans were scratching their heads after Sian and Jason White were deemed poor, despite admitting to a weekly spending budget of \u00a3185. Pictured, from Left: Matt, Claire and Taylor standing outside their home\n\nUsed to not having a garden, Sian and Jason were delighted by life in the Donovan's lavish home, with a swimming pool, hot tub, conservatory and five acres of gardens.\n\nThey quickly became used to splashing the cash, with Sian forking out a whooping \u00a3450 in an upmarket farm shop picking up artisan cheese, expensive wine, seafood and a plethora of treats for their children.\n\nHalf way through the week they moved out, to the Donavan's smaller cottage because the main property was being rented out to holidaymakers.\n\nThe episode saw the Whites, who live in a two-bedroom cottage with their children, Oscar, five and Jack, 13, swap lives with Claire and Matt Donovan, who live in a six-bedroom house 20 minutes away. Pictured: Taylor, Claire and Matt standing in the Whites' kitchen with dinner\n\nSian was in awe of the quirky property, saying that 'this is the sort of thing, artistic and imaginative - this is what life is about for me, not the money, not showing off.\n\n'It's actually making me quite emotional, I can't stop looking at it all.'\n\nMeanwhile, Claire, originally a hairdresser who's built up several salons, quickly adjusted - managing to get two bottles of wine included in her weekly shop, without breaking the budget of \u00a350.\n\nHow much money do you take home on minimum wage? Jason works four days a week in a warehouse on minimum wage, which is \u00a38.21 an hour, while Sian also works part time in a community centre. As they have two children under 16, they'll also take home \u00a3149 a month child benefit. If they work 40 hours between them, they'll take home around \u00a31261 a month after tax, depending on exactly how the work is split. This means, after their rent (\u00a3500 a month) and bills (\u00a3100 a month) they'd have just over \u00a3800 left to spend on food and anything else. In the show they say they have \u00a3185 a week, and they spend \u00a350 a week on food leaving them with \u00a3135.\n\nProving she's thrifty, she also offered her skills as a hair dresser in order to buy a barbecue.\n\nLater, unable to afford a birthday cake for Matt's birthday, she made him one from scratch, but her teenager son Taylor, who spends \u00a3300 a month on takeaways, struggled more.\n\nAt the end of the week, her husband, a painter who sells his work to celebrity clients including Robbie Williams and Sting for up to \u00a320,000 a piece, was keen to make friends aspiring tattoo artist Jason.\n\nClaire and Matt standing outside the Whites' house with a barbeque. Hoping to treat her husband on his birthday, Claire throws Matt a street party as their new home doesn't have a garden\n\n'I can take a break whenever I want to at home, but when you're here working for somebody it has to be all the time,' he said.\n\n'I'd like to invite Jason to come and join me, have a get together do some painting and drawing. I think that would boost his confidence as well'\n\n'You do have those moments when something gives you a knock but you have to dust yourself off, pick yourself up and get on with it.\n\n'The most important thing is hard work, determination and having a dream.'\n\nTaking to Twitter, fans questioned why the Whites were deemed poor, despite having more than \u00a3800-a-month to spend after rent and bills\n\nTeenager Taylor admitted he was 'looking forward to getting back in the hot tub and just having a nice bathe' but Claire said she had remorse over the situation.\n\n'I really feel for Sian and Jason and what they are up against.\n\n'People like myself have got lots of property that they rent out to people, it's making things unobtainable for people to buy and also the asking price for rent, well the sky is the limit.\n\n'I feel a little bit ashamed.'\n\n'Watching Rich House Poor House - they have \u00a3185 a month to spend but claim to struggle. I don't even have that a month!' one person wrote. Another added: 'I don't think \u00a3185 after everything is paid is poor. I must live on a different plant to some of these people'. Left to right: Jack, Oscar (on his back), Sian and Jason standing outside the Donovans' home\n\nHowever, not all viewers at home agreed, with one commenting: 'This programme just takes the p*** out of people who are really hard up. \u00a3500 rent, \u00a3185 a week spending money... that's rich! Try living next to Heathrow, and double that just for rent and a room!'\n\nA fourth questioned the family's motives for being on the show.\n\n'Turned Rich House Poor House off as can't watch this family doing 'woe is I' when in reality they're not bad off. Moans the child is sick because he's lactose intolerant yet she's just given him a milkshake. Clearly on the show to sell her husband's art and not because they're hard off!'\n\n'Am I missing something because this 'poor family' really isn't surely. I mean spare \u00a3185 a week seems pretty okay, even sustaining four people?' a fifth penned.", "description": "Sian and Jason White from Dorest swapped lives with multi-millionaires Claire and Matt Donovan for the Channel 5 show Rich House, Poor House, but viewers questioned their monthly budget.", "authors": ["Bridie Pearson-Jones For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/11/19581930-0-image-a-33_1570788239315.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
