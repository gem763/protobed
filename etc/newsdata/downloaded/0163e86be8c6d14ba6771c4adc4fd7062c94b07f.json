If there\u2019s an argument that Hunter Biden joining Burisma while his father was VP wasn\u2019t a brazen attempt at influence peddling, I\u2019ve yet to hear it.\n\nPhilip Klein is shrewd about the politics of this issue on the Democratic side, though. Under any circumstances, the liberal commentariat would swat away concerns about the Bidens\u2019 dealings with Ukraine as a feeble attempt to change the subject from Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. But after the GOP used Emailgate so effectively against Hillary in 2016, Democrats will be even more aggressive about enforcing a \u201cno distractions!\u201d rule this time. They insist that this election be a referendum on Trump, period.\n\n[T]here are plenty of important lines of inquiry for Biden. For instance: Was he aware of Hunter\u2019s deal? Did he think it was OK? Did he raise any concerns within the Obama administration about potential conflicts of interest, especially if he was being made the messenger on Ukraine policy? Furthermore, looking forward, how would he, as president, handle potential conflicts of interest should corporations try to influence policy through his son? After all, as president, he would no longer be the messenger but the decider\u2026 In the liberal narrative of the 2016 election, the media paid too much attention to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server and thus overlooked all of Trump\u2019s corruption. They see any questioning of Biden on this matter as falling into the same trap. Democratic opponents are also reluctant to bring up the issue because they don\u2019t want to appear as if they\u2019re echoing Trump\u2019s talking points.\n\nDemocrats have a self-interested reason to ignore questions about Hunter Biden, Klein adds, but the media does not. To which I\u2019d add a caveat: Some Democrats have a reason to ignore those questions, but not all. Obviously it\u2019d be right in the wheelhouse of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d campaign to make an issue of an obvious appearance of impropriety in her chief rival\u2019s contributions to Ukraine policy as VP. It\u2019s too risky for her to do so right now when it\u2019s still unclear whether Democratic voters will rally to Biden\u2019s side against Trump or abandon him in the belief that this Ukraine matter will erode his \u201celectability\u201d in the general election. But grassroots left-wingers who loathe the idea of nominating Biden obviously have every reason \u2014 for now \u2014 to pursue the Hunter Biden story. They don\u2019t even need to accuse Biden of anything, merely to wring their hands about how bad the whole thing looks in hopes of convincing swing voters in the primary that Warren would prove more \u201celectable\u201d than Biden in the long run after all.\n\nBiden\u2019s advisors are naturally keenly aware of how dangerous this story is to him and, per the Times, are doing their best to choke off media coverage of Hunter Biden\u2019s Ukraine business:\n\nBiden advisers, who argue that Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on the former vice president underscores his fears about Mr. Biden, have mounted a ferocious offensive against reporters who have questioned Mr. Biden\u2019s record on Ukraine or raised his son\u2019s business dealings. It is a strategy they say will continue; whether Mr. Biden faces doubts from voters over those issues will become clearer in the coming weeks. Privately, some of Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers and allies said this week that they would like to see the former vice president speak out more forcefully against Mr. Trump, in a way that channels the outrage of the party\u2019s base and the resolve of Democrats in Congress.\n\nBiden is keeping his comments about Trump and Ukraine mostly low key for now, probably because he too is uncertain how the politics of the Ukraine matter will shake out. If he gets theatrically indignant about it and starts lambasting Trump in order to show the left that \u201che fights!\u201d, he risks making Hunter a bigger factor in the campaign than he is right now. If instead he continues to lie low and focus on policy, he\u2019s destined to be knocked for not fighting hard enough and for ducking the sort of legitimate questions Klein raised in the excerpt above.\n\nEveryone\u2019s waiting for polling. Trump, Biden, Warren, Pelosi, McConnell \u2014 everyone. If Biden gets a sympathy bounce in the polls \u2014 \u201cthe Orange Grinch is scapegoating Joe for his own scandal!\u201d \u2014 Warren may steer clear of making Hunter Biden an issue for the time being, fearing it would alienate Democratic voters. If instead Biden sinks, it\u2019s open season. The lower-polling candidates may end up doing her dirty work for her, in fact; it\u2019s easy to imagine Kamala Harris trying to knife Biden about the Ukraine episode at the next debate in hopes of generating a little buzz for herself. However it plays out, Trump seems increasingly likely to end up stuck inside a \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d episode in which his Ukraine ploy to destroy Biden worked a little too perfectly, sinking Grandpa Joe before he won the nomination and leaving Trump himself weakened by an impeachment scandal as Warren prepares to face him in the general election.\n\nSpeaking of Biden fading, here\u2019s some interesting gossip from yesterday:\n\nSCOOP\u2014Sources inside @JoeBiden camp bracing to lose Iowa, New Hampshire primaries to @ewarren but banking on Super Tuesday wins to reverse Warren\u2019s momentum. Democrat fundraisers withholding contributions to Biden as Warren surges more now @FoxBusiness @TeamCavuto \u2014 Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) September 27, 2019\n\nRumors about Biden writing off Iowa and even New Hampshire have swirled before. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the Ukraine matter that has him panicked, though; I think it\u2019s the round of polling that showed him neck and neck with Warren *before* the Ukraine story really took off that\u2019s left him anxious. News broke a few days ago that Biden might roll out a Warren-esque plan to tax Wall Street financial transactions, an obvious pander to try to buoy up his support. Another story claimed that Biden supporters might break the informal \u201cno Super PACs\u201d pact that Democratic candidates have forged and unleash an outside group on Biden\u2019s behalf. The guy\u2019s clearly worried about his chances, especially now that Ukraine will be front and center in American politics for the next several months.
