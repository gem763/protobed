Miley Cyrus thought she could fit in one early morning erotic a\u00e7a\u00ed experience in L.A. on Thursday, but TMZ spotted her (making) out with Australian musician Cody Simpson. While most patrons try very hard not to watch us making out at our a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl places, Miley doesn\u2019t have that luxury, so she first tried to poke fun at the situation on Instagram, posting a thirst trap of Simpson, before taking to Twitter with a sincere reminder: once in a while, if we are very lucky, we might find ourselves with the opportunity to make out over an a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl. Is it really so very wrong if we decide to go for it?\n\n\u201cI am just trying to THRIVE/survive in a \u2018mans\u2019 world,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf our president can \u2018grab em by the pussy\u2026,\u2019 can\u2019t I have a kiss and a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl?\u201d Having separated from husband Liam Hemsworth and briefly dated Kaitlynn Carter earlier this fall, Cyrus asks everyone to please refrain from slut-shaming her, and instead take her a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl make out for what it is: part of the normal dating life of a very, very, very famous person.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fucking pity me, not what I\u2019m asking for. I have a great life I wouldn\u2019t trade for \u2018privacy\u2019 but PLEASE don\u2019t make this awkward for me!,\u201d the singer posted. \u201cI am trying to make light and like always MAKE FUN of myself / and the public\u2019s perception of me!
