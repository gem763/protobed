The states\u2019 effort is expected to be bipartisan and could include more than 30 attorneys general, one of the people said.\n\n[Facebook, Google and other big tech giants are about to face a \u2018reckoning,\u2019 state attorneys general warn]\n\nOver the past year, regulators around the country have grown increasingly wary of the power wielded by Silicon Valley, questioning whether the industry\u2019s access to vast amounts of proprietary data \u2014 and deep pockets \u2014 allow companies to gobble up rivals and maintain their dominance to the detriment of consumers. Two federal antitrust agencies have opened probes targeting the industry broadly, while lawmakers in Congress have grilled executives from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google about the business practices. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nOutside of the nation\u2019s capital, however, state officials also have started questioning the growing influence of big tech. Attorneys general in multiple states have threatened that competition probes could be on the horizon, The Post first reported in March, and states such as Louisiana and Mississippi have sharply criticized Google for its handling of users\u2019 personal information and its algorithms for surfacing search results. Those states did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTexas officials have raised similar concerns. They have also said that Google may be violating state consumer-protection laws if political bias at Google resulted in the censorship of conservative viewpoints. A spokesman for the attorney general there also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n[The Justice Department is preparing a potential antitrust investigation of Google]\n\nOver the summer, some attorneys general met privately with officials from the Justice Department, which announced its own broad review into big tech, to discuss their antitrust concerns. The agency\u2019s antitrust leader, Makan Delrahim, later said at a conference in August that the federal government is coordinating with state leaders, which he numbered at more than a dozen, but declined to offer further details about the agency\u2019s plans.\n\nIt is unclear whether the Justice Department will join the states at the event, and a spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s services help people every day, create more choice for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country,\u201d spokesman Jose Castaneda said in a statement. \u201cWe continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.\u201d\n\nThe states\u2019 looming antitrust investigation of Google threatens to saddle the company with years of regulatory scrutiny, even though the federal government has the most powerful tools at its disposal \u2014 including the ability to try to break up a business for violating competition laws.\n\nBut state attorneys general can contribute to federal action. For example, in the 1990s, the states helped build a broader case against Microsoft after rivals complained that it leveraged its Windows monopoly as it entered new markets and used it to erect barriers to competitors.\n\n\u201cIf multiple states \u2014 and I mean not just Democratic attorneys general but Republican attorneys general as well \u2014 are all looking into potential antitrust violations, one of the biggest effects might be to pressure the federal government to do a deeper dive,\u201d said Doug Gansler, the former attorney general of Maryland and a top lawyer at the firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.\n\n[Facebook, Google and other tech giants to face antitrust investigation by House lawmakers]\n\nFor Google, the states\u2019 heightened interest comes about six years after the U.S. government formally studied the tech giant\u2019s search-and-advertising business but opted against slapping it with significant penalties. The inaction in the United States came to stand in stark contrast with Europe, which later issued a series of stinging, multibillion-dollar fines against the company for the way it displays search results and manages its Android smartphone operating system.\n\nThe Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s broad reviews into big tech could evolve into more formal probes of Google and its Silicon Valley peers. Senate lawmakers on Tuesday announced they would hold a hearing focused on tech giants that acquire smaller rivals.", "description": "More than half of the nation\u2019s state attorneys general are readying an investigation into Google, scheduled to be announced next week.", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter", "September At Pm", "Tony Romm Is A Technology Policy Reporter At The Washington Post.
