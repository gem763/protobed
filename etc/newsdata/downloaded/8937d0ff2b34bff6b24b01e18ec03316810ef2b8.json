On Wednesday, it was a hot and humid 88 degrees in New York City. So, put that cashmere bra you ordered on ice for a bit. The heat wave didn\u2019t stop Rihanna from wearing a bedazzled green turtleneck dress following her Savage x Fenty show at the Barclays Center that night, though. And it didn\u2019t keep her from wearing a black velvet turtleneck dress to the Diamond Ball on Thursday, either.\n\nShe arrived to her annual charity event, which benefits the Clara Lionel Foundation, founded in honor of her grandparents, wearing a thick Givenchy Haute Couture gown. If the top-half looked somewhat familiar, that\u2019s because Meghan Markle is also a fan of designer Clare Waight Keller\u2019s work, and wore a similar-looking black velvet gown to the British Fashion Awards back in December. Markle happened to be pregnant at the time, and the internet seemed to think the same of Rihanna the following morning. But having seen the singer dance in a sheer bodysuit the night before, this rumor seems unfounded and downright rude. Let her live! The whole point is that this dress is both flattering and super comfortable.\n\nThe bottom-half of Rihanna\u2019s look is really where you should be focusing, anyway. A white mesh and wire hoop skirt explodes from the hem of her dress like a mermaid tail. It\u2019s very Marie Antoinette, but make it a turt. See the stylish surprise for yourself, below.\n\nClick to reveal", "description": "Despite New York\u2019s fall heat wave, Rihanna wore a black velvet Givenchy Haute Couture turtleneck dress with a hoop skirt hemline to the Diamond Ball on Thursday.
