It was sort of a diatribe,\" he continued. \"Not focused on the facts, particularly the facts about how to contain Isis.\"\n\n\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the Democratic leaders were \"deeply offended\" by the president's comments and walked out of the meeting.\n\nMs Pelosi also announced the White House had cancelled a classified briefing scheduled for Thursday with House members about the latest developments in Syria.\n\nShe said scrapping the meeting prevents Congress from learning about \u201cthe dangerous situation\u201d caused by Mr Trump\u2019s withdrawal of troops in the region.\n\nMs Pelosi said she was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d because House members have a right to be informed about such decisions.\n\nSoon after the meeting a letter from Mr Trump to the Turkish president, dated 9 October, was released. In it the US president tells his counterpart: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2013 and I will!\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cHistory will look upon you favourably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool! I will call you later.\u201d\n\nEXCLUSIVE: I have obtained a copy of \u2066@realDonaldTrump\u2069\u2019s letter to #Erdogan. \u2066@POTUS\u2069 warns him to not \u201cbe a tough guy! Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d Says he could destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if #Syria is not resolved in a humane way.

The South Carolina Republican said Mr Trump would \u201cbe held accountable\u201d, adding that the president\u2019s decision was \u201cagainst all sound military advice\u201d.\n\nHe also said he hopes Mr Trump \u201cwill reconsider, stop the bloodshed and reset the table before it\u2019s too late\u201d.\n\nMr Graham said that if Mr Trump continues along those lines, \u201cthen our foreign policy is in a very bad spot in the Middle East and to those who think the Mideast doesn\u2019t matter to America, remember 9/11 we had that same attitude on [11 September] 2001\u201d.\n\nAnother Republican senator, Florida\u2019s Marco Rubio, told reporters that he didn\u2019t know what could be done to undo the harm that\u2019s resulted from the withdrawal. Mr Rubio said: \u201cThere are some mistakes that are not easy to reverse. And there are some that are irreversible.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by AP\n\nRead more\n\nErdogan tells Trump Turkey will \u2018never declare ceasefire\u2019 in Syria\n\nTrump angrily denies giving Turkey \u2018green light\u2019 for Syria invasion\n\nTurkey \u2018effectively holding 50 US nuclear bombs hostage\u2019 at air base\n\nRussian soldiers filmed apparently moving into US Syria base\n\nNine suspected Isis members escape from camp in Syria, says France\n\nHow Russia is filling the gap left by Trump\u2019s withdrawal of US troops", "description": "Donald Trump had a \u201cmeltdown\u201d at the White House in a meeting with House leadership on Wednesday, Democrats said, after Congress passed a bipartisan resolution rebuking him for his withdrawal of troops in northeastern Syria.In a press conference held immediately after the meeting, Senate Minority Leader", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hAB11smAkEgrBHkZ5BqRRw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/9199e5ebaab9489592bbc04bf4e4210b", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
