But the British player committed 35 unforced errors to Svitolina's 13, including a whopping 20-5 margin in the second set, and fell to 0-5 against the Ukrainian.\n\nFederer dominant on hard court\n\nRoger Federer resumes his bid for his first U.S. Open title in 11 years with a quarter-final under the lights at night against unseeded Grigor Dimitrov.\n\nThe 38-year-old Federer is trying to become the oldest male Grand Slam semifinalist since Jimmy Connors was 39 during his 1991 run at the U.S. Open.\n\nFederer's potential path to the final no longer includes nemesis Novak Djokovic -- or anyone else who ever has beaten him on a hard court, for that matter.\n\nThat's because Federer is a combined 26-0 on that surface against the players left on his half of the bracket. He is 6-0 on hard courts against Dimitrov, 17-0 against Stan Wawrinka and 3-0 against Daniil Medvedev.\n\nMedvedev tops Wawrinka\n\nDaniil Medvedev is continuing his hard-court roll right into the U.S. Open semifinals after beating Stan Wawrinka 7-6 (6), 6-3, 3-6, 6-1.\n\nThe No. 5 seed reached the final four at a major tournament for the first time and improved his tour-leading total to 49 victories this year. He reached the final in three straight tournaments on hard courts leading into the U.S. Open, winning the last one.\n\nWATCH | Medvedev advances to 1st career Grand Slam semifinal:\n\nDaniil Medvedev defeats Stan Wawrinka in 4th sets, moves on to U.S. Open semifinals. 1:09\n\nMedvedev, 23, had his legs treated twice in the first set but played through the pain to become the youngest semifinalist at the U.S. Open since Novak Djokovic was also 23 in 2010.\n\nHe will play five-time champion Roger Federer or unseeded Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals.\n\nWawrinka eliminated the defending champion Djokovic in the fourth round but fell short of getting back to the semifinals for the first time since winning the 2016 U.S. Open title.", "description": "Fifth-seeded Elina Svitolina followed her first appearance in the final four of a major at Wimbledon in July by getting right back there at the U.S. Open Tuesday, where she will face either six-time champion Serena Williams or Wang Qiang.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5268972.1567536068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/svitolina-elina-190903-1180.jpg"}
