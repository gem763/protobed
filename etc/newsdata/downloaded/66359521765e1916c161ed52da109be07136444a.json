Adam Schiff (D-CA) know about the complaint and when did he know it?\n\nSchiff was aware of the complaint from at least August 12 when he allegedly received it from the whistleblower. Yet he didn\u2019t inform his colleagues in Congress until last week. He went on ABC on the Sunday and told George Stephanopoulos that \u201conce he found out about the complaint\u201d he demanded answers and went public right away. But that wasn\u2019t true, he waited a month.\n\nHis colleague Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) called him out on it, asking why had he not informed Congress.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8IMPT question \u2013 when did Adam Schiff have access to the complaint or any related information? The letter to Schiff and Burr was dated August 12th. Did Schiff have ANY access earlier than Committee & if yes, why did he not immediately share this with his Committee? \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 \u2014 Elise Stefanik (@EliseStefanik) September 27, 2019\n\nNow there\u2019s another strange connection that Schiff has in the case.\n\nAs Breitbart notes, one of Schiff\u2019s Congressional staffers, Thomas Eager, took a trip to Ukraine between August 24-31 with other Congressional staffers after the whistleblower complaint was filed. Rep. Adam Schiff approved his staffer\u2019s travel as his signature on the travel request revealed.\n\nThat trip was paid for by the Atlantic Council.\n\nOne of the senior fellows of the Council is CrowdStrike founder Dmitri Alperovitch. You may recall Crowdstrike is the company that supposedly concluded the Russians were behind the hack of the DNC in 2016 during the campaign. The FBI never had access to the server. Trump asked about Crowdstrike on the call with the Ukrainian president.\n\nAccording to the transcript, Trump told Zelensky, \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nTwo prominent names are among the folks who fund the Atlantic Council. One is George Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundation. And the other? Burisma, the company which appointed Hunter Biden to its board and who the subject of the investigation that was allegedly stopped when Biden pressured Ukraine, according to the prosecutor who was fired.\n\nIn January 2017, the Atlantic Council and Burisma signed a cooperative agreement, which stated Atlantic Council would develop transatlantic programs with Burisma\u2019s support, focusing on European and international energy security.\n\nSo Hunter Biden\u2019s old company Burisma is funding the group paying for Schiff\u2019s staffer\u2019s trip to Ukraine. Once again that raises questions if there was anything said or done in relation to the whistleblower\u2019s case between Schiff or his staff and the Ukrainians.\n\nWho did they talk to when the staffers were in Ukraine and did any of it relate to the complaint or the Bidens and Trump?\n\nBreitbart asked the Atlantic Council what the staffers were doing there. According to the Atlantic Council:\n\n[T]he pre-planned trip was part of the fellowship program, which also includes a full year of round tables and other educational events. She said it was not within her portfolio to comment on issues of funding from Burisma or other donors.\n\nBreitbart said they did not get a response from Eager about the trip.\n\nHT: Diane B", "description": "Schiff\u2019s Staffer Traveled to Ukraine, Trip Was Paid for by Group Funded by Hunter Biden\u2019s Old Firm", "authors": ["Nick Arama", "Alex Parker", "Sarah Lee", "Sister Toldjah", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Joe Cunningham", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/schiff-this-week-memo-e1517769294589.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
