The Double Tourbillon 30\u00b0 movement, which launched the brand in 2004, has been reinterpreted with translucent sapphire crystal, which is extremely hard and challenging to machine.\n\nIn reconstructing the movement, Robert Greubel and Stephen Forsey embraced that challenge as a means to heighten the visual impact of the mechanism. Particularly daunting were the three-dimensional sapphire bridges machined from single blocks of sapphire crystal with flanks polished using different finishes, a process that required special tools and exceptional expertise.\n\nThe beveled angles have a matte finish to create a contrast with the polished surfaces, while the clear bridges provide a window into the mesmerizing movement\u2019s layers of wheels and pinions.\n\nTaking the transparent concept to its extreme, the tourbillon bridge, barrel bridge, differential bridge, and power-reserve bridge were removed and recreated in sapphire in order to fully reveal the watch\u2019s inner workings. Even tiny details such as screws were re-evaluated, and the bridges had to be specially mounted for heightened shock absorption.\n\nThe hour and minute ring, as well as the four-minute tourbillon-rotation indicator at 6 o\u2019clock are also made from clear sapphire crystal to allow light to flow through the mechanism, while the hands have been skeletonized to amplify the piece\u2019s ethereal character.\n\nIt's the first watch the brand has ever produced with a ceramic case. Greubel Forsey\n\nThe eye is immediately drawn to the whirling Double Tourbillon 30\u00b0 mechanism with two suspended cages pirouetting at different speeds. The outer cage completes a revolution in four minutes while the inner smaller cage, containing the balance and spring assembly, completes its rotation in one minute, while inclined at a 30\u00b0 angle relative to the first cage.\n\nThat 30\u00b0 inclination combined with the different rotational speeds of the two tourbillons, delivers heightened precision by averaging out positional errors due to gravity. Meanwhile, four coaxial barrels coupled to a spherical power-reserve differential, provide a chronometric power reserve of 120 hours.\n\nHeightened performance is not merely theoretical at Greubel Forsey. Seven years after the partners unveiled the Double Tourbillon 30\u00b0 Technique, it took first prize at the Concours International de Chronom\u00e9trie, with an average timing rate of between 0.3 and 0.8 seconds per day over the entire course of the competition.\n\nFrom the case back side, the unusually large, multilevel gear train bridge reveals the finely finished movement structure beneath. The lower tourbillon bridge is also sapphire made to exactly mimic the steel bridge of the original Double Tourbillon 30\u00b0 Technique, which was no small feat working with such an extremely hard material.\n\nAnother first for the brand is the colored case made of ceramic, sintered at very high temperatures to endow it with extreme resistance to scratches and corrosion. The toughness of that material makes it more difficult to finish\u2014from polishing to linear or circular satin finishing that impart a subtle shimmer, complementing the radiant sapphire movement.\n\nThe special U.S. edition is fitted with a ceramic crown featuring a tone-on-tone engraved Greubel Forsey logo, and it comes on a blue rubber strap with the company\u2019s guiding principles spelled out on the interior.", "description": "Limited to 11 pieces, the watch will sell for $695,000 only in the U.S. market", "authors": ["Laurie Kahle"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-105679/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
