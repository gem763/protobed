Subreddit", "language": "en", "text": "Image: Lionsgate Films\n\n\u201cAm I the Asshole?\u201d is a subreddit where users tell a story of interpersonal conflict, and ask who\u2019s in the wrong. Redditors give their opinions, and the most-upvoted comment becomes the verdict. While a crowd of 1.2 million redditors may not be the ideal jury for deciding appropriate social behaviour, reading these stories is messy fun. Here are the best.\n\n\u201cAITA for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that\u2019s just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?\u201d\n\nThe most famous post in the subreddit. This went around Twitter and Facebook too, until everyone knew about this poor arsehole, who won\u2019t take his girlfriend out on a date. \u201cNow that I\u2019m thinking about it,\u201d he writes, \u201cshe\u2019s gotten kinda gloomy because I\u2019ve asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often.\u201d The whole internet made fun of this jerkoff who didn\u2019t realise he was treating his girlfriend like his servant.\n\nHis updates were even better: This isn\u2019t some early relationship, they have kids together. He took his girlfriend out for one dinner of tapas, then got so excited that he proposed to her. She said no. Then the post went viral, the girlfriend saw it, and she got mad \u2014 as we learn from an update post, in which the guy admits he\u2019s still making his girlfriend cook every night. Breathtaking. As one commenter says, \u201cThe way you talk about being fed casserole for the thousandth time as if youre serving time in purgatory instead of being fed by a loving girlfriend is insane to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAITA for sleeping naked on top of the covers to teach my flatmate\u2019s gf a lesson?\u201d\n\nGuy gets sick of his roommate\u2019s girlfriend barging into his room without knocking (sometimes when he was still in bed, naked under the covers), even after he asked her not to. So one morning he lays on top of his covers naked, she walks in on him, and now the roommate and the girlfriend both think our redditor is a creep. (He says in the comments that his lease doesn\u2019t allow a lock on the door, and that he\u2019s \u201cgay as spring.\u201d) Consensus is that he\u2019s the good guy here, and that he needs to get a doorstop. Seems a bit late for that.\n\n\u201cAita for giving all of my coworkers a different reason for why I have missing fingers?\u201d\n\nRead enough of these and you\u2019ll find one where you disagree with the majority opinion. Redditor \u201cthrowawaycwdrama\u201d is sick of people asking about TCWD\u2019s three missing fingers. So when each of the redditor\u2019s new co-workers asked, TCWD gave a different silly answer. The co-workers believed them, argued amongst themselves over the real reason, and got mad at the redditor for lying to them.\n\nCommenters mostly agreed that there\u2019s no arsehole here and this is all silly \u2014 which is ridiculous! It\u2019s rude to ask a new co-worker about a physical condition! It\u2019s ludicrous to ice them out because they\u2019d rather not tell you! There was a lot of controversy in the thread over whether or not the co-workers were arseholes, but somehow \u201cno arseholes here\u201d won out. UGH\n\n\u201cAITA For calling my co-worker \u2018chunky\u2019 after she repeatedly calls me \u2018slim\u2019 and makes references to my weight after I asked her multiple times not to.\u201d\n\nReddit has a fat-shaming problem, and it shows up a lot in this subreddit. I was ready to vote \u201cYTA\u201d \u2014 you\u2019re the arsehole \u2014 from this headline, but then I read the story: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t call me by name she calls me \u2018slim\u2019 and I even heard her say one time \u2018go ask toothpick\u2019 and she has said stuff like \u2018you need some meat on your bones\u2019 & \u2018you need to eat.\u2019 I have only worked there 8 days. I have asked her very nicely to stop.\u201d\n\nSo the next time her co-worker said \u201cHey Slim,\u201d she replied, \u201cHey Chunky.\u201d And the co-worker cried. Commenters widely agree that the redditor isn\u2019t the arsehole here, though a few wise ones suggested getting out of the body-shaming game and going with \u201cGood morning, verbally abusive stranger!\u201d \u2014 or simply replying \u201cHey Slim!\u201d right back.\n\n\u201cAITA for not allowing my best friend to crash at my house after his wife died?\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t about a friend wearing out his welcome \u2014 this redditor\u2019s friend is trying to raise a 3-year-old daughter alone after his wife died, and he asked the redditor to put them up for one night because he can\u2019t sleep at home surrounded by memories of his wife. The redditor says, hoo boy, \u201cI tell him she can stay but he can\u2019t because he has to get over it eventually.\u201d Everyone agreed the redditor is the arsehole; some don\u2019t believe this story could even be real.\n\n\u201cAITA for telling cashier that wasn\u2019t the girls credit card?\u201d\n\nThe mods had to tell people to stop insulting this redditor, even though she is clearly the arsehole. (It\u2019s an important rule of this subreddit: don\u2019t be an arsehole, even to an arsehole.) This redditor overheard a teen girl saying she was going to buy an expensive pair of boots on her dad\u2019s credit card. She decided this means the teen is a spoiled brat. So she followed the girl to the register and told the cashier, \u201cThat\u2019s not her card.\u201d Then the cashier wasn\u2019t allowed to sell the teen the boots.\n\nThe teen cried, and the redditor took this as proof the teen was spoiled \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t think she was ever told no.\u201d And then the teen used her own card to buy the boots. Which really seems like the nail in the coffin for our redditor. Cashier and the redditor\u2019s husband both feel that she was out of line for shaming this teen. Reddit heartily agrees.\n\n\u201cAITA for suggesting my 7yo name his new stuffed tiger Tig Bitties?\u201d\n\nKid names his stuffed tiger Tig, asks for a last name. Dad suggests \u201cBitties.\u201d Kid loves it, wife is \u201cpissed.\u201d The vast majority of redditors decided, \u201cNAH\u201d: No Arseholes Here. Mum\u2019s right, that name could cause a little trouble, but so what?\n\nRead more of the greatest arsehole stories on the subreddit\u2019s top posts page, and follow new stories here. Remember, even when replying to an arsehole, do not be an arsehole. The goal is to have fewer arseholes in the world, is it not? (For a subreddit with fewer rules and sillier submissions, try the spinoff Am I the Butthole?)\n\nAnd think very carefully before posting your own story in this subreddit. Most popular threads have a post from the moderators up top, telling everyone to stop threatening and abusing each other. (They\u2019re pretty good at cleaning up the bad comments, so if you get to a post after the first few days, it\u2019s usually only appropriate comments up top.) And you\u2019ll get lots of direct messages from supporters and detractors.\n\nThe author of \u201cAITA for asking my brother not to bring his boyfriend to my wedding?\u201d posted an update to their legitimately difficult post: \u201cI wanna thank the redditor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!\u201d", "description": "\u201cAm I the Asshole?\u201d is a subreddit where users tell a story of interpersonal conflict, and ask who\u2019s in the wrong.
