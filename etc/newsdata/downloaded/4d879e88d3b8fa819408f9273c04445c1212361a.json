REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nRisperdal was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2002 to treat schizophrenia, but was not cleared for use in children until 2006.\n\nWhile the drug\u2019s label does note that gynecomastia was reported in 2.3% of Risperdal-treated patients in clinical trials involving 1885 children and adolescents, the lawsuits generally claim the company understated the risk.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is also among drugmakers named in lawsuits seeking to hold the pharmaceutical industry responsible for the nation\u2019s opioid crisis and in August was asked to pay $572.1 million to the state of Oklahoma for its role in fueling the epidemic.", "description": "Shares of Johnson & Johnson dipped 2% on Wednesday after a jury awarded $8 billion in punitive damages to a man who accused the drugmaker of failing to warn that young men using its antipsychotic drug Risperdal could grow breasts.", "authors": ["Tamara Mathias", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438847408&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9818C", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
