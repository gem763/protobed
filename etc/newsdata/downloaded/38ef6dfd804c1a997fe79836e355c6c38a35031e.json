Guyger was convicted of murder last week for shooting a neighbor, Botham Jean, in September 2018.\n\nGuyger said she entered Jean\u2019s unlocked apartment, which was one floor above her own, by mistake, and shot him in the belief he was a burglar. Brown, who lived on the same floor as Jean, was a witness for the prosecution in Guyger\u2019s murder trial and was set to testify in a civil suit brought by his family against the city.\n\nJean was black. Guyger is white.\n\nBrown was killed Friday night outside his new apartment, in a different building. On Tuesday, the Dallas Police Department said they had two suspects in custody and a warrant for a third.\n\nLee Merritt, an attorney who represented Jean\u2019s family and is now representing Brown\u2019s, called for an independent investigation by the Dallas County Sheriff\u2019s Office or the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\n\u201cThis family and their representatives have consciously avoided speculating about law enforcement involvement in this tragedy; however, due to the proximity of this murder with the trial of Amber Guyger \u2014 rumors abound,\u201d Merritt wrote, adding, \u201cA cloud of suspicion will rest over this case until steps are taken to ensure the trustworthiness of the process.\u201d\n\nThose sentiments were echoed by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund after Brown\u2019s death but before the arrests. The organization endorsed calls from Allison Jean, Botham\u2019s mother, for the Dallas Police Department to \u201cclean up inside\u201d amid concerns of evidence tampering during the Guyger trial.\n\nJoshua Brown testifying during the murder trial of former Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger.

Most importantly, it demands an independent investigation of how and why he was killed,\u201d said Sherrilyn Ifill, the legal defense fund\u2019s president and director-counsel. \u201cWe urge state or federal authorities to follow the trail of misconduct left by this case and fully investigate the circumstances surrounding Mr. Brown\u2019s death. It is critical to public confidence in the administration of justice that witnesses who speak out against police violence are fully protected. The suspicious circumstances of Mr. Brown\u2019s killing should cause great alarm and demand an immediate and piercing inquiry. We echo Allison Jean\u2019s statement that the \u2018corruption we saw during this process must stop,\u2019 and support her request for a comprehensive federal investigation of the Dallas Police Department.\u201d\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., referred to Brown\u2019s death as an \u201cinjustice\u201d in a Sunday tweet.\n\n\u201cJust when we caught a glimpse of justice for Botham Jean, much of it feels stolen back with the murder of Joshua Brown, a key witness in the case,\u201d wrote Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cMy heart breaks for his family and for everyone touched by this tragedy. We must get to the bottom of this injustice.\u201d\n\nAccording to the police, Brown died in a drug deal gone bad. The department said there was an altercation outside Brown\u2019s apartment complex involving three Louisiana men that ended with Brown shooting one of the men and being killed himself before the men fled, taking Brown\u2019s bag and gun. The wounded suspect was brought to a hospital, and survived.\n\nActing on a tip, the police said they found 12 pounds of marijuana, 149 grams of THC cartridges and more than $4,000 in cash in Brown\u2019s apartment.\n\nThere was no testimony at Guyger\u2019s trial indicating that Brown was dealing drugs.", "description": "The family of Joshua Brown, who was expected to be a witness in a civil case against the city of Dallas, has called for an independent investigation into his killing.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MbfaSg.NrWH4ebjeOFQo1A--~B/aD00NDA2O3c9NjUxOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/37f0caf0-ead2-11e9-bf9d-5cfa30f1309e", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
