Add Interest\n\nAndrew Bakaj, an attorney for the whistleblower, writes that \u201cthe events of the past week have heightened our concerns that our client\u2019s identity will be disclosed publicly and that, as a result, our client will be put in harm\u2019s way.\u201d Bakaj also claimed that \u201ccertain individuals have issued a $50,000 \u201cbounty\u201d for \u201cany information\u201d relating to our client\u2019s identity.\u201d\n\nThe legal team declined comment on the specific security issues raised.\n\n\"The current environment is one that requires sensitivity and intelligence about security and there are ongoing discussions about how to best to prepare for worst-case scenarios,\" a source close to the case told ABC News.\n\nErin Scott/Reuters\n\nIn the letter to Maguire, Bakaj cited President Trump\u2019s comments about the whistleblower\u2019s sources as cause for concern. In a closed door meeting last Thursday, a video recording shows Trump saying telling an audience \u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person that gave the whistleblower, who\u2019s the person that gave the whistleblower the information, because that\u2019s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nAlthough the president\u2019s comments were directed at the person or persons who shared information with the whistleblower, Bakaj said it \u201cdoes nothing to assuage our concerns for our client\u2019s safety.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s legal team also forwarded their letter to Maguire to the leadership of the House and Senate intelligence committees, calling on both parties to call out for whistleblower protection and \u201creiterate that this is a protected system where retaliation is not permitted, whether direct or implied.\u201d\n\nIn Bakaj\u2019s letter to Maguire, he states \u201cwe expect this situation to worsen, and to become even more dangerous for our client and any other whistleblowers, as Congress seeks to investigate this matter.\u201d\n\nTom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nIn a tweet sent Monday afternoon, Bakaj said, \"The Intel Community Whistleblower is entitled to anonymity. Law and policy support this and the individual is not to be retaliated against. Doing so is a violation of federal law.\"\n\nSen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told ABC News on Monday, \u201cI think it would be reasonable, if this person were to come forward, that he or she probably deserves some protection, protective services for a while because of the jeopardy by the president's, I think, irresponsible comments has potentially put this person in.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told ABC Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on \u201cThis Week\u201d Sunday that an agreement had been reached with Maguire to allow the whistleblower to appear before his committee. \u201cWe'll get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower,\u201d Schiff said, adding that the committee is \u201ctaking all the precautions\u201d possible to protect the whistleblower's identity.\n\nThe president, who has denied any wrongdoing alleged in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint focusing on a July phone call between Trump and the president of the Ukraine, tweeted Sunday \u201cI deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called \u201cWhistleblower,\u201d represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way.\u201d Trump also doubled down on his threats directed at the whistleblower\u2019s sources, saying they would face \u201cbig consequences.\u201d\n\nThe intelligence community\u2019s inspector general found that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was \u201ccredible\u201d and of \u201curgent concern.\u201d That complaint was released to the public last Thursday, ahead of acting Maguire\u2019s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on his handling of the complaint.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies have attempted to discredit the whistleblower\u2019s credibility. Mark Levin, a radio host and Trump supporter, appeared on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d on Saturday to demand more information on the whistleblower, saying \u201cI want to know everything about him! I want to know what kind of dogs they have, how many marriages they've had, if they have a DUI, if they're a partisan, I want to know everything!\u201d\n\nAlthough the House and Senate are on a two-week break, members of the House involved in the impeachment inquiry are working through the recess, with depositions related to the probe scheduled to begin this week.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s legal team said in a statement that they were continuing to work \u201cwith both parties in the House and Senate and we understand and agree that protecting the whistleblower\u2019s identity is paramount.\u201d\n\nA time or date has yet to be set for the hearing, which will likely occur behind closed doors to protect the whistleblower\u2019s anonymity. When asked about projected timing for the testimony, Schiff said he expected to hear from the whistleblower \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nABC News' James Gordon Meek contributed to this report.", "description": "The lawyers for the Ukraine call whistleblower have expressed concerns for their client's safety in the wake of President Donald Trump's comments and other criticism.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/trump-5-ap-er-190926_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
