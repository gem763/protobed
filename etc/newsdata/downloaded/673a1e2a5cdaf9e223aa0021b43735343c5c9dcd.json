We\u2019re in Italy in a fire brigade training center. Today, robots are being tested by researchers. Their mission: to help the rescuers.\u201d\n\nWhat do robots need to do ... to work in these human-robot teams? Ivana Kruijff-Korbayova TRADR project coordinator\n\nAfter industrial accidents or natural disasters, the collection of information is crucial and robots can be precious allies to assist with this.\n\nGround robots and drones were developed within European research project TRADR. Remotely controlled, their mission is to search and explore the accident site. They can even create digital maps of the environment in three dimensions.\n\nRenaud Dub\u00e9, autonomous systems engineer, ETH Zurich:\n\n\u201cThere is a laser sensor on the robots that measures the distance on a map, and in two dimensions. Rotating it makes it possible to make a truly three-dimensional map. Most of the time we use two to three robots, each of which is equipped with one of these sensors.The aim is to merge all the measurements together to have a global representation of the environment.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to better assess the risks and protect the lives of the rescuers. Experts in robotics work directly with the final users, firefighters.\n\nEmmanuele Gisi, fireman, Vigili del Fuoco:\n\n\u201cThis collection of information is very useful to us. This is the first phase of our intervention and is the one that allows us, while arriving at night or in the rain, to schedule the intervention operation and to ensure the safety of operators.\u201d\n\nRobots can carry any sensor needed in a particular situation, such as exposure to gas or radioactivity. Some even have articulated arms to gather samples.\n\nFor researchers, the challenge is to optimise the interaction between machines and humans.\n\nIvana Kruijff-Korbayova, TRADR project coordinator, German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence:\n\n\u201cNowadays, robots are kind of everywhere. What they typically do not do is really tight collaboration with people and collaboration between different robots. So that\u2019s one of the big topics to look into \u2012 what do robots need to do in order to be able to work in these human-robot teams.\u201d\n\nScientists were able to put their research to work during the devastating earthquake in Amatrice, central Italy, last August.\n\nAt the request of the firemen and the authorities, they managed to deploy their robots to assess the damage of two classified 14th- century churches, San Francesco and San Agostino.\n\nLuigi Freda, computer engineer, Sapienza University of Rome:\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult mission because the churches were in very bad condition, so much so the firefighters could not get in to make a detailed analysis.\n\n\u201cFirst, a robot came in to monitor the back of the church and then another robot entered at the front. We then managed to get a drone and we filmed the entire interior, which resulted in the 3D model.\u201d\n\nMission accomplished. High quality textured 3D images will assist in building reinforcement and heritage protection.\n\nIvana Kruijff-Korbayova:\n\n\u201cWe have seen that such a deployment is possible. Even with the research tools that we have. My hope is that we\u2019ll actually be able to build a European robot-assisted disaster response readiness [team].\u201d\n\nFirefighters and scientists are working to deepen their collaboration to have a team set for rapid deployment, ready to face any type of disaster.", "description": "European research project TRADR has allowed scientists and firefighters to use ground robots and drones to assist in post-disaster rehabilitation.", "authors": ["Ivana Kruijff-Korbayova"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/362448/1000x563_362448.jpg", "published_at": "2017-04-10"}
