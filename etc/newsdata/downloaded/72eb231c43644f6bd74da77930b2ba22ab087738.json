Dating back to last season when the Red Sox took Games 4 and 5 in Los Angeles, visiting teams have won seven straight World Series games for the first time.\n\nDuring the first two games of the Series in Houston, the visiting Nationals outscored the Astros by a 17-7 margin. Back home in Washington with a chance to close out the visitors, the Nats were outscored by Houston 19-3 in three games, all losses.\n\n\u201cWe took a pretty heavy punch in the gut when it came to the first two games,\u201d said Astros manager AJ Hinch. \u201cThe Nats came out hot. They won a close game, then they blew us out late. And then you take a step back, and you\u2019re like, we\u2019re still in the World Series and it\u2019s still a race to four wins. You win that first win. I said that: I think the vibe was going to start to pick up a little bit.\u201d\n\nWith the Series now shifting back to Houston for Game 6 and the Astros in a position to clinch their second title in three seasons, history is on their side.\n\nIn the two previous instances (1906 and 1996) when road teams won the first five games of the World Series, the home team won Game 6, and the title, both times. Overall, home teams in MLB are 43-24 in Game 6s and have won five of the last six.\n\nPrior to the Series, home teams were 17-13 in the postseason.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at The Associated Press", "description": "For just the third time in Major League Baseball history, the road team has taken the first five games of the World Series.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1183868976-e1572276582289.jpg?fit=837%2C558", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
