Brexit day. It stands for Brexit, it stands for Britain, it stands for Boris, it stands for back off Brussels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m paraphrasing here but God said something like \u2018Noah, if you build that ark, animals will get on it\u2019 and he said to me \u2018Graham, if you get that tattoo, we will definitely crash out without a deal\u2019.\n\n\u2018Something which I am looking forward to.\n\n\u2018Come the 31st of October, someone is going to be looking silly.\u2019\n\nHis persona Graham is a central character in the spoof news network Hey News.\n\nThe finished artwork (Picture: Argus/Sussex News and Pictures)\n\nThe group of comedians mock national politics and local issues in a series of short mockumentaries for social media.\n\nPrevious creations include a \u2018death cult\u2019 who follow Nigel Farage and a group of conspiracy theorists who believe the M25 is straight.\n\nAsked whether he would be getting the tattoo removed, Ruari said: \u2018I think something like this, there\u2019s no going back from.\n\n\u2018Like Brexit.\u2019\n\nThe UK is set to leave the European Union at 11pm on October 31.\n\nIt was originally due to happen in March this year, two years after the triggering of Article 50.\n\nBut the deadline for leaving has since been delayed twice, and there\u2019s no guarantee it will actually happen this time around.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
