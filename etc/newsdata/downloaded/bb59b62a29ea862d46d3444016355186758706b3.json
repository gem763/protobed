That's according to a new CBS report that was published Sunday.\n\nWashington and Cincinnati been receiving calls for a while now, yet so far \"ownership has declined to even consider moving forward on them,\" Jason La Canfora writes. Those around the league are apparently quite annoyed by this, with one GM saying specifically of the Redskins, \"It's not like you are dealing with a normal team.\"\n\nThe Browns have been particularly aggressive in going after Trent Williams, but the Burgundy and Gold have rebuffed Cleveland time and again. Ryan Kerrigan is also garnering some interest from contending teams, per La Canfora, but those organizations don't believe he'll be moved before the deadline, either.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFor quite some time, Bruce Allen has maintained that the Redskins are on the right path despite a hideous record that would suggest otherwise. Because of that record, Washington should, at the very least, entertain whatever offers come their way.\n\nHowever, as long as Allen seriously believes that his plan is working, then it's likely no trades will happen, considering he's the one who executes them.\n\nThe deadline strikes at 4 p.m. on Tuesday. Some major swaps have already been made well ahead of it, and more could happen as things wind down. The indication, though, is that the Redskins won't be involved in any them, unless they drastically change their approach.\n\nMORE REDSKINS NEWS:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Redskins are reportedly not acting like a 'normal team' ahead of NFL trade deadline originally appeared on NBC Sports Washington", "description": "A CBS report is stating that, before Tuesday's trade deadline, the Redskins are frustrating other NFL teams by refusing to seriously entertain any incoming offers for certain players.", "authors": ["Peter Hailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qbxsRCH6erzmpHhgHbVwKw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwOTY7aD01ODY-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MmtKNOkGQt2_XYHgXyUppg--~B/aD0yOTM7dz01NDg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnwashington.com/41eb2728738bb61baf72674af99ef71c", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
