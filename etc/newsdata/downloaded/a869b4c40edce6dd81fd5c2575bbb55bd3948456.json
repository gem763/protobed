Elizabeth Warren says she wasn\u2019t referring to former Vice President Joseph R.

If we get rid of Trump, everything is going to be just fine,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat said Tuesday evening on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren has risen into second place behind Mr. Biden in some of the recent public polling on the 2020 Democratic presidential field and drew an estimated 20,000 or so people to the speech on Monday evening.\n\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s a lot at stake in this election. And I know, people are scared,\u201d she had said at the New York event. \u201cBut we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in just because we\u2019re too scared to do anything else.\u201d\n\nMuch of polling on the 2020 field has shown potential Democratic primary voters pick Mr. Biden as the candidate most likely to defeat President Trump in 2020, and that they value a candidate perceived to have a better shot to oust the president than one they might agree with more on the issues.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
