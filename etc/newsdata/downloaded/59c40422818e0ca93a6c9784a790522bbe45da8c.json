Photo: Joan Marcus\n\nIf the presence of two British theater grandees playing a couple who\u2019s been married for half a century, along with the title The Height of the Storm, makes you think you\u2019re in for 90 minutes of Strindbergian Sturm und Drang, you\u2019re in entirely the wrong ballpark. Come down from the furious fjords, with their long lineage of theatrical battles of the sexes, and you\u2019ll find yourself in a big airy house outside Paris, long inhabited and comfortably cluttered, full of books, with a garden outside the kitchen window. Here live Andr\u00e9 and Madeleine, played in Christopher Hampton\u2019s translation of the hip French playwright Florian Zeller\u2019s rather wispy drama by Eileen Atkins and Jonathan Pryce. They\u2019ve been married for ages, they like mushrooms, and they love their adult daughters, uptight Anne (Amanda Drew) and serial-dating Elise (Lisa O\u2019Hare), but they prefer it when they\u2019ve got the house to themselves. Mostly, they love each other, truly and entirely. Except \u2026 Madeleine is dead.\n\nOr is Andr\u00e9 dead? Or is the nearness of death \u2014 for either or both \u2014 just looming in the air? The trick of Zeller\u2019s play, directed by a mostly unobtrusive Jonathan Kent, is that we\u2019re never quite sure what reality we\u2019re in. It\u2019s as if Zeller wrote out several scenarios, cut the dialogue into pieces, spread it out on the floor, and intertwined the possibilities. Dimensions overlap. Conversations that imply the absence of (and the family\u2019s mourning for) one parent will be diverted by the appearance of that parent. Andr\u00e9 or Madeleine will go silent for a long stretch, dropping out of a scene as a living presence and instead haunting it as a ghost, but then someone will acknowledge one of them, and he or she will speak and live again.\n\nZeller approaches his play like someone fiddling with the dial on an old radio. He hops between frequencies, creating not so much a narrative as a meditative haze. In the playwright\u2019s 2016 Broadway debut, The Father, Frank Langella won a Tony as an 80-year-old former dancer descending into Alzheimer\u2019s. In The Height of the Storm, though Madeleine remains tack-sharp, Andr\u00e9 shows signs of disintegration. Zeller\u2019s territory is fragmentation, pointillism with half the dots missing. In some ways, the delicacy of The Height of the Storm is its strength \u2014 in the opportunity it offers for powerful actors to work with small brushes, and in the notable and refreshing absence of rage and resentment from its central characters. But this gauziness of tone also keeps the play from feeling intellectually or emotionally filling. It feels, to use the French, like an \u00e9tude \u2014 a chance for performers to play briefly, and at times movingly, on certain themes, but without much ultimate sense of consequence.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Zeller\u2019s bendy-twisty approach to time and reality allows him to get away with a certain number of dangling threads, enigmatic gestures that hint at meaning but seldom do more than hint. On the night before the play begins, there\u2019s a big storm. \u201cIt woke me up,\u201d Anne says to her father in the first scene. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time since I\u2019ve seen such a violent storm. It was impressive. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d There\u2019s recurring reference to a news story about an elderly couple who committed happy suicide-via-poison-mushroom at the hotel where they honeymooned in their youth \u2014 the same hotel where mushroom-loving Andr\u00e9 and Madeleine honeymooned. There\u2019s a mysterious bunch of flowers sent without a card. There are figures known only as the Man (James Hillier) and the Woman (Lucy Cohu) \u2014 but while the Woman shifts identity, portraying a couple of different figures from the past with a hefty helping of smoky-voiced je ne sais quoi, the Man only ever really represents Elise\u2019s boring boyfriend, Paul. The flowers, the dead couple, the strangers in the house, the titular storm: They all could be something, but none of them quite is. Well-honed mystery undergirded by a foundation of authorial certainty is one thing, but Zeller\u2019s play doesn\u2019t seem to set rules for itself. Instead, it banks on titillation through ambiguity, which can make it feel coy.\n\nThe production\u2019s saving grace is the absolutely wonderful Eileen Atkins. Though Pryce\u2019s Andr\u00e9 \u2014 with his shaking hands, faraway stare, and sporadic outbursts both of cheer and aggrieved frustration \u2014 is more accurately the center of the show, he\u2019s too consistently lost to captivate us as fully as Atkins\u2019s brisk, no-nonsense Madeleine. If there is a One Reality to Rule Them All in the play, it\u2019s the one in which Andr\u00e9 has lost his wife and, along with her, his grip on himself and the world around him. Pryce is vulnerable and affecting, his big forehead furrowed and his hands constantly twitching, as if searching for something small and precious he let fall. His, though, is a strong performance, while Atkins seems, simply and a little magically, to be breathing through Madeleine\u2019s lungs. She\u2019s so completely at ease with herself, so entirely un-acty, so agile and sharp without the slightest hint of force, that it\u2019s hard to stop watching her whenever she\u2019s onstage. Late in the play, she also delivers a brilliant lesson in how to turn Zeller\u2019s sometimes writerly dialogue into sheer, fluid elegance. As Anne in the play\u2019s first scene, Drew does her best but understandably stumbles through a long, trope-y chunk of text spoken to her father \u2014 one of those, \u201cI\u2019m going to keep talking even though you aren\u2019t answering because this is a play and there are things we need to know\u201d bits. Madeleine\u2019s got the same kind of set piece near the show\u2019s end, and Atkins tosses it off with total grace and self-possession, setting the stage for the finale, a quiet duet between Madeleine and Andr\u00e9, to be truly and deeply touching. She, at any rate, is an artist at the height of her particular storm.\n\nThe Height of the Storm is at the Samuel J.
