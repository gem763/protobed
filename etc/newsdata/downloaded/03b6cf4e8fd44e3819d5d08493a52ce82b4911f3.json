That is not right.\u201d\n\nA pro-democracy protester who only gave his name as Wong defended the use of violence.\n\n\u201cWe know that they will not listen if we rally in peace because we are not on the same level,\u201d he said.\n\nSome Lennon Walls were torn down by pro-Beijing activists last weekend. The large mosaics of Post-it notes calling for democracy have cropped up in underpasses, outside shopping centers, at bus stops and universities.\n\nThe anti-government protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula guaranteeing freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina vehemently denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.\n\n\u2018NOT SURE WHEN PROTEST WILL END\u2019\n\n\u201cLennon Walls carry the spirit of civil disobedience from the Umbrella movement,\u201d said pro-democracy protester Kelvin Law, 24.\n\n\u201cI am not sure when this protest will end. Either we win or we lose. But as long as we are united and fight, generation after generation, we can achieve democracy.\u201d\n\nProtesters appealed to the British two weeks ago to rein in China and ensure it respects the city\u2019s freedoms.\n\nBritain says it has a legal responsibility to ensure China abides by the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which lays out the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement.\n\nAt the same time, it is pinning its hopes on closer trade and investment cooperation with China, which since 1997 has risen to become the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after it leaves the European Union at the end of October.\n\nThe protests were sparked in June by planned legislation, since withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. But they have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement.\n\nThe student-led Umbrella protests that gridlocked the city for 79 days in 2014 failed to wrest concessions from Beijing.\n\nOne of the leaders of those protests, the bespectacled Joshua Wong, 22, said on Saturday he will run for local district council elections in November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to let Emperor Xi (Chinese President Xi Jinping) be aware that now is our battle,\u201d he told reporters. \u201c...We stand in solidarity, we stand as one.\u201d\n\nWong is on bail after being charged with inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly outside police headquarters on June 21.\n\nVarious protests are expected on Saturday and Sunday, but the biggest are likely to be on Tuesday, marking the Oct. 1 anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949.\n\nActivists plan a mass rally from Victoria Park in the bustling Causeway Bay district to Chater Garden, a cricket pitch back in colonial days, in downtown Central.\n\nOfficial festivities for National Day have been scaled back, with authorities keen to avoid embarrassing Beijing at a time when Xi is seeking to project an image of national strength and unity.", "description": "Hong Kong protesters were rebuilding Lennon Walls of anti-government graffiti on Saturday as they marked the fifth anniversary of the \"Umbrella\" democracy movement that gridlocked the territory for weeks.", "authors": ["Angie Teo", "Joyce Zhou", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434820854&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R070-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
