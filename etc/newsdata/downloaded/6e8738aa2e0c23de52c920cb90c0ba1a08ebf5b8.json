As Rousseau used to say: Let\u2019s get this bread!\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nWe closed the day, October 11 2019, at a price of $8,321. That\u2019s a notable 3.06 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$263.5. It was the lowest closing price in two days.\n\nWe\u2019re still 58 percent below Bitcoin\u2018s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).\n\nBitcoin market cap\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market cap ended the day at $149,685,618,275. It now commands 67 percent of the total crypto market.\n\nBitcoin volume\n\nYesterday\u2019s volume of $19,604,381,101 was the highest in fifteen days, 27 percent above the year\u2019s average, and 56 percent below the year\u2019s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 410 tons of gold.\n\nBitcoin transactions\n\nA total of 345,269 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 2 percent above the year\u2019s average and 23 percent below the year\u2019s high.\n\nBitcoin transaction fee\n\nYesterday\u2019s average transaction fee concerned $0.26. That\u2019s $3.45 below the year\u2019s high of $3.71.\n\nBitcoin distribution by address\n\nAs of now, there are 12,252 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.6 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.5 percent, and the top 1000 34.3 percent.\n\nCompany with a market cap closest to Bitcoin\n\nWith a market capitalization of $149 billion, PetroChina has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s path towards $1 million\n\nOn November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.\n\nHe even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn\u2019t. Unfortunately for him it\u2019s 92.8 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin\u2018s price should have been $115,476 by now, according to dickline.info.\n\nBitcoin Energy Consumption\n\nBitcoin used an estimated 200 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 73 terawatt hour. That\u2019s the equivalent of Austria\u2019s energy consumption or 6,8 million US households. Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption now represents 0.3% of the whole world\u2019s electricity use.\n\nBitcoin on Twitter\n\nYesterday 16,759 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That\u2019s 10.5 percent below the year\u2019s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day this year about Bitcoin was 41,687.\n\nMost popular posts about Bitcoin\n\nThis was yesterday\u2019s most engaged tweet about Bitcoin:\n\nThis was yesterday\u2019s most upvoted Reddit post about Bitcoin:\n\nprint(randomGoodByePhraseForSillyHumans)\n\nMy human programmers required me to add this affiliate link to eToro, where you can buy Bitcoin so they can make \u2018money\u2019 to \u2018eat\u2019.", "description": "", "authors": ["Satoshi Nakaboto", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F08%2Fbitcoin_today-header_bitcoin_today.jpg&signature=30221b6a68049cc6bc3b58f3ddb38864", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
