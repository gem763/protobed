Democrats are reeeeeeeally hyping it\u2026\n\nLots of Dems, like Lieu, say Taylor\u2019s testimony was explosive. Rep. Espaillat said this was the most important witness so far. Unanimity among Ds on this point so far. \u2014 Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) October 22, 2019\n\n\u201cAll I have to say is that in my 10 short months in Congress \u2026 it\u2019s my most disturbing day in Congress so far,\u201d said Rep. Andy Levin, a freshman Democrat from Michigan. \u2014 Shimon Prokupecz (@ShimonPro) October 22, 2019\n\n\u2026but there were lots of moments during Russiagate that were reeeeeeeeally hyped as well, and you know how that turned out.\n\nTo refresh your memory, Bill Taylor is the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. He\u2019s also the guy who was on the now-famous text exchange with ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, in which Taylor wrote to Sondland in September, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d That \u2026 sounds like the sort of illicit quid pro quo that Democrats are suspicious of. Reportedly, Sondland didn\u2019t reply to Taylor\u2019s text at first; instead several hours passed, during which time Sondland spoke to Trump. Only then did he finally text Taylor back to stress that the president has been \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that no quid pro quo took place with Ukraine, a curiously for-the-record reply.\n\nNaturally Democrats wanted to hear more from Taylor about what he knew regarding withholding Ukraine\u2019s military aid in exchange for help \u201cwith a political campaign.\u201d If you believe the leaks to the media this afternoon, he didn\u2019t disappoint. The key allegation from this afternoon\u2019s testimony, allegedly, is Taylor claiming that Sondland told him Trump didn\u2019t want to release the military aid until Ukraine made a public pledge to investigate the Bidens and Burisma, as well as 2016 matters like the DNC server.\n\nThe senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine said Tuesday he was told release of military aid was contingent on public declarations from Ukraine that it would investigate the Bidens and the 2016 election, contradicting President Trump\u2019s denial that he used the money as leverage for political gain. Acting ambassador William B. Taylor Jr. testified behind closed doors in the House impeachment probe of Trump that he stands by his characterization that it was \u201ccrazy\u201d to make the assistance contingent on investigations he found troubling\u2026 \u201cDuring that phone call, Amb. Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President [Volodymyr] Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election,\u201d Taylor said in the statement\u2026 \u201cAmb. Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling the Ukrainian officials to whom he spoke that a White House meeting with President Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of investigations \u2014 in fact, Amb. Sondland said, \u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance,\u2019\u201d Taylor told House investigators.\n\nPolitico claims there were \u201csighs and gasps\u201d in the room as Taylor went through his opening statement, with one Dem rep emerging later to say that Sondland now had a lot of explaining to do about his own testimony before the committee. WaPo reporter John Hudson adds this important detail: Although Sondland supposedly stressed to Taylor that Trump wasn\u2019t demanding a quid pro quo, which may be true or may be CYA, he also claimed that Trump himself had expressed interest in the Biden/Burisma matter. That was a key missing piece from what Mick Mulvaney said last week. Per Mulvaney, Trump had mentioned the DNC/CrowdStrike server in connection with the hold-up in Ukraine aid but not Biden. Taylor, citing Sondland, says otherwise:\n\nWow \u2014 > Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony totally contradicts Amb. Sondland\u2019s claim that he recalls \u201cno discussions\u201d with anyone at the State Department or White House about Biden or his son. Taylor says Sondland heard about Biden directly from Trump:https://t.co/mkmJWgSbjz pic.twitter.com/7xXzBJAd5E \u2014 John Hudson (@John_Hudson) October 22, 2019\n\nWe already knew that someone up the chain was interested in getting Ukraine on the record, publicly, that they were pursuing the Biden and DNC matters. In August, Sondland and Kurt Volker, the White House\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, helped prepare a statement for Zelensky in which he would have committed to investigating Burisma and Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 election, specifically. (Volker allegedly testified that Rudy Giuliani had requested those two subjects be mentioned in the statement.) Why did Trump want a public statement? One reason might have been to simply force Ukraine to actually follow through on the probes. It would have been easy for them to assure him privately that they\u2019d investigate and then, once they had the military aid in hand, to forget all about it. A public statement was the closest thing to a contract available to the president under the circumstances. Trump may also have wanted Zelensky to say something publicly in order to generate media coverage, especially coverage here in the U.S. The press can dismiss Trump\u2019s accusations about Biden and the CrowdStrike on grounds that it\u2019s partisan blather but a formal investigation by Ukraine would lend those claims new gravity.\n\nThe Zelensky statement prepared by Sondland and Volker wasn\u2019t released. But the military aid wasn\u2019t released to Ukraine either after Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky on July 25th. Not until members of Congress started asking questions in September about why the aid had been held up did Trump finally hand it over to Ukraine. Whether he\u2019d still be sitting on the aid to this day if Congress hadn\u2019t pressured him, hoping to finally squeeze that public commitment to investigate Biden out of Zelensky, is one of the unsolved mysteries of this story.\n\nIf you can believe it, according to a WaPo story published early this morning before Taylor\u2019s testimony, Trump is or was under the impression that Democrats might not impeach him after all.\n\nThe president has told several friends in recent days that he believes Democrats are divided and somewhat scattered about how to proceed in their impeachment inquiry, according to people who have spoken with him. He has said he believes that House Democrats might fumble their probe and eventually decide against bringing articles of impeachment to a floor vote, according to two Trump advisers briefed on his discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly. But most of his friends have gently cautioned against that optimism and said Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is determined to move forward, the advisers said.\n\nWe\u2019re way past the point where it\u2019d be less dangerous politically for Pelosi to cancel impeachment than to simply proceed with it. Polling shows moving forward on impeachment to be no worse than a 50/50 proposition or so; meanwhile the left would melt down if she pulled the plug now and let Trump off the hook. They have a very real chance of getting 51 votes in the Senate to remove, a symbolic victory that a majority of the chamber believes the president should be removed. They\u2019re obviously going to impeach him. It\u2019s alarming that Trump\u2019s at the level of denial where he thinks there\u2019s even a small chance that they won\u2019t.\n\nOne more thing about Taylor: The Times claims that he \u201crelied in part on detailed \u2018notes to the file\u2019 that he had made,\u201d an echo of James Comey\u2019s habit of memorializing his conversations with Trump after the fact. \u201cMr. Taylor\u2019s habit of keeping notes throughout his tenure has given the inquiry a boost, allowing him to recreate crucial conversations and moments even as the administration seeks to block Congress from reviewing documents related to its dealings with Ukraine,\u201d the NYT insisted. Again, if you want to disregard all of that for now on grounds that it\u2019s second-hand information passed along by Trump-hating Democrats, that\u2019s perfectly fair. But there\u2019s every reason to believe Taylor will be a key witness at Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, and that if the account of what he said today is true he\u2019ll create big trouble for the president in the Senate. This is a sneak preview of what\u2019s ahead.\n\nUpdate: Annnnnd WaPo has now obtained Taylor\u2019s entire opening statement. A taste:\n\n\"Ambassador Sondland tried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check.\u201d https://t.co/rtPQjU5TmK pic.twitter.com/VMfb0oQgvV \u2014 Ryan J. Reilly (@ryanjreilly) October 22, 2019\n\nExactly my point earlier. Trump didn\u2019t want Zelensky to merely assure him privately that he\u2019d investigate the Bidens and the DNC server, he wanted a commitment. Either a public statement or the formal reopening of the probes by the Ukrainian government. Perform your labor, then you get your compensation.
