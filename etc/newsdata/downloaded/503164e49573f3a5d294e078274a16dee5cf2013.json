Asked if someone other than Corbyn could lead such a government, McDonnell said: \u201cNo, the rules are the rules\u201d.\n\nHe suggested Swinson might change her mind, adding: \u201cI\u2019m a great believer in the powers of conversion.\u201d\n\nA senior Labour source said: \u201cPeople who want a government of national unity are playing fantasy football teams. It\u2019s absolute, complete nonsense. Not only would no such thing ever be agreed, but the idea that such a government could exist for six months with no mandate is pure, utter nonsense.\u201d\n\nInstead, Labour is determined to push for a general election as soon as a no-deal Brexit has been averted.\n\nSeveral Labour MPs at Monday night\u2019s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party told Corbyn they would prefer a referendum to be held before a general election.\n\nThat argument has previously been made by the deputy leader, Tom Watson, and the idea of attaching a \u201cconfirmatory\u201d referendum to any Brexit deal the prime minister secures from the EU27 is again being discussed. But the Labour leader has repeatedly rejected that idea.\n\nOpposition MPs and Conservative rebels banded together last month to pass the Benn Act, aimed at forcing Johnson to request a Brexit delay if he fails to pass a deal by 19 October.\n\nBut the MPs have widely differing views about how that extension should be used \u2013 with some hoping Brexit can be reversed, and others that the time could be used to negotiate a deal.\n\nInstead, Labour has mooted the idea that Corbyn could lead a caretaker government for a matter of days: just long enough to request an extension to article 50 and call a general election. The SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, has repeatedly made clear that his party could support that idea.\n\nAsked whether Swinson could change her mind and support a Corbyn-led government, a Lib Dem spokesman said: \u201cJo is a great believer in the power of mathematics. Jeremy Corbyn does not have the numbers and needs to make clear who he would support if we need an emergency government.\u201d\n\nCorbyn stamped his authority on Labour\u2019s Brexit policy at last week\u2019s party conference in Brighton, persuading delegates to back his chosen course of fighting a general election, without picking in advance which side Labour would take in a future referendum.\n\nWith the Conservatives poised to campaign on the slogan \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, Corbyn\u2019s allies are concerned that becoming a remain party would jeopardise votes in leave-supporting constituencies.\n\nBut several key shadow ministers, including Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry, have made clear they want the party to adopt a remain position.\n\nThornberry was dropped as Corbyn\u2019s regular stand-in for prime minister\u2019s questions (PMQs) after criticising the party\u2019s message in May\u2019s European elections.\n\nWith Johnson due to deliver his party conference speech in Manchester at the same time as PMQs on Wednesday, Dominic Raab will appear for the government \u2013 and Corbyn will be represented by the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott.", "description": "Shadow chancellor backs Labour leader amid concerns over cross-party support", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65e685e33e5948c54201d64a91f94f277f60fd5c/0_533_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e7ced22c5a06076889d552a84f12ae87", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
