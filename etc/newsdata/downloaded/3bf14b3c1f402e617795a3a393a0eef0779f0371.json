But this week they have hit the news when a shortage of them caused a key measure of borrowing costs\u2014known as the overnight repo rate\u2014to spike. That is a worry because typically these more wonky areas of finance only become interesting when something is going wrong.\n\nWhat do you want to know about repo and bank reserves? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe overnight repo rate, which is what banks and other financial players charge each other to lend cash in exchange for supersafe bonds, should be close to 2%, but it shot up almost as high as 10% on Tuesday. One of the underlying causes of this is a scarcity of reserves compared with the amount of Treasury bonds in the market. That has made banks less willing to lend to each other even in exchange for safe government bonds.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York in lower Manhattan.

It conducted a third auction on Thursday morning and offered $75 billion in repos.\n\nHere is a simplified rundown of what reserves are and how they have come to matter.\n\nWhat are reserves?\n\nNot many people realize this, but there are two basic types of money in the world. There is central bank money, which is known as reserves, and there is money that the rest of us use.\n\nCentral bank money can only be used by banks, governments and some government-linked institutions. They have this money in accounts at the central bank, where it is called \u201creserves.\u201d The money that the rest of us use is private money that is created by ordinary banks. There is also some special central bank money that everyone can use: The notes and coins in our wallets.\n\nWhat are reserves for?\n\nThe main day-to-day function of reserves is for banks to make payments to each other that reflect transactions between the rest of us. When one person transfers money to another person, it looks like private money moves from one bank account to another.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t what really happens. In fact, the first person\u2019s bank reduces the amount in the person\u2019s checking account, which is really just a record of money the bank owes that person. It then sends an equivalent amount of reserves to the second person\u2019s bank. That bank now owes the second person more money and so it increases the value of their deposit with private money.\n\nThe same is true when your employer pays you your wages (assuming you don\u2019t get them in notes and coins anyway), or when you pay for your groceries with a debit card.\n\nWhere do reserves come from?\n\nOne way reserves find their way into the banking system is when a government spends money. Whether it wants to pay government workers\u2019 wages or buy cruise missiles, it sends reserves from a government\u2019s central-bank account to the central-bank account of the ordinary bank used by the person or company who is getting the money. That bank then increases the value of the deposit in the accounts of workers or cruise missile suppliers.\n\nThe government can get some of those reserves back by selling a Treasury bond to investors, which is done via primary dealers, banks who have a special role acting as market makers for government bonds. The bond sale is paid for, or settled, using reserves from the banks that have the deposit accounts of those investors.\n\nWhere does QE come in?\n\nThe whole point of QE\u2014quantitative easing\u2014was to ease the pain of the financial crisis by flooding the financial system with money, which would make all kinds of borrowing significantly cheaper.\n\nCentral banks did this by creating trillions of dollars (or euros or Japanese yen) worth of reserves to buy back government bonds from investors via banks. This gave banks vast amounts of reserves. In turn, the banks gave those selling the bonds equally vast amounts of new private money. That private money could then be spent in the economy or used to buy riskier corporate bonds for example. The higher demand for other forms of debt would make that debt cheaper for borrowers.\n\nAnd then the Fed started to reverse QE?\n\nYes, the Fed stopped buying Treasurys when it felt the economy was on solid footing. When the bonds that it owned matured, the government had to repay the Fed. The government did this by handing reserves back to the Fed which the Fed then destroyed, reversing the process when it bought the bonds in the first place.\n\nReserves also leave the banking system when the government sells new Treasurys to private investors or when it collects taxes. Tax payments are special because governments, unlike companies or private citizens, deal directly in reserves. That means a tax payment involves reserves being transferred from an ordinary bank to a government account at the central bank. An equivalent amount of private money in the taxpayer\u2019s bank account disappears.\n\nThe upshot: New sales of Treasury bonds and tax payments take reserves out of the banking system.\n\nSo why does this all suddenly matter now?\n\nThis is the trillion-dollar question. The answer, according to some analysts, is that the Fed isn\u2019t sure how much reserves banks need these days. New rules since the crisis and the stress tests that banks have to beat have together increased the amount of reserves they want to hold.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nBut reserves have been shrinking because of the reversal of QE, increased government borrowing in the Treasury market and a recent wave of tax payments, among other things.\n\nOne key cause of the crunch in overnight lending markets is that there are more Treasurys around than banks want to own, but some banks are still being forced to buy them. These are the so-called primary dealers who buy Treasurys from the government and then sell them to investors.\n\nIf banks don\u2019t want to spend their own reserves to buy Treasury bonds, they have to borrow those reserves from elsewhere. They can do that directly in specialist bank-only markets, or they can try to borrow private money in overnight lending markets, where rates spiked this week.\n\nThat is why the short-term fix has been for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to offer to take some of those Treasurys in exchange for new reserves. The longer-term solution could be a more permanent arrangement where the Fed conducts regular auctions\u2014unless it turns out that the problem isn\u2019t just with banks, but that there is a real need for funding coming from somewhere else in the system that hasn\u2019t yet been identified.\n\nWrite to Paul J.
