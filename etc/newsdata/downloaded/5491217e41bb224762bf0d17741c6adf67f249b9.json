USA TODAY\n\nMartin Scorsese may not love the \"Avengers\" movies but the Oscar-winning director can certainly put together his own superteam.\n\nHis new Netflix gangster epic \"The Irishman\" (\u2605\u2605\u26051/2 out of four; rated R; in New York and L.A. theaters Friday, expanding through November, and streaming Nov. 26) doesn't disappoint with its all-star mob-movie trio, pairing Scorsese favorites Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci again alongside Al Pacino (working with the director for the first time).\n\nSprawling across three and a half hours \u2013 and several decades \u2013 with infamous figures and an immersive narrative, it's an amazingly crafted historical fiction that's much more than guys shooting each other in the head, though there is still plenty of that.\n\n'Irishman' first reactions: Critics call Scorsese's latest an 'instant crime classic'\n\n'I can\u2019t wait to see him in jail': Robert De Niro calls Trump a 'gangster president'\n\n\"The Irishman\" in question is Frank Sheeran (De Niro), a World War II veteran and Philadelphia truck driver who delivered slabs of meat before getting involved in organized crime. He becomes a hitman of note though the audience first meets him in a rest home, nearing his own death and coming to grips with a career of bloodshed.\n\nRussell Bufalino (Joe Pesci, left) is a close confidante and boss to Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) in Martin Scorsese's \"The Irishman.\" (Photo: NIKO TAVERNISE/NETFLIX)\n\nFrank's tale bounces between decades but centers on his close friendship with two men. Russell Bufalino (Pesci) is a crime boss who has a chance meeting with Frank. He's taken by the former soldier's mastery of Italian from the war, and Russell looks out for Frank as he moves up the ranks.\n\nFrank is later hired as muscle for Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino), and the two strike up a fast personal connection. \"I thought I was talking to General Patton,\" Frank says of the charismatic (and ill-fated) union icon \u2013 though Frank has his loyalties tested when Hoffa runs afoul of various crime families.\n\nJimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino, left) is led out of a media scrum by Bill Bufalino (Ray Romano) and Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) in 'The Irishman.\" (Photo: Niko Tavernise / NETFLIX)\n\nHistory buffs will enjoy how the story by Steven Zaillian (\"Schindler's List\") views real-life feuds like Hoffa vs. Robert F. Kennedy (Jack Huston) and events such as Bay of Pigs, the Kennedy assassination and Watergate through a gangland lens.\n\nThe film, an adaptation of the 2004 confessional \"I Heard You Paint Houses,\" is also a technical marvel, with Scorsese employing some de-aging movie magic to track his main characters over time. With the exception of young 1950s Frank looking creepily unreal in a couple instances, it's all impressively uncanny and key to caring for these personalities as they evolve and change.\n\nPlaying Frank from ambitious upstart to thoughtful old man, De Niro lends a quiet vulnerability as his character balances his professional and personal lives. \"The Irishman\" leans more into his crime family than his real household, though it's Frank's love for his estranged daughter Peggy (Anna Paquin) \u2013 who's witnessed her father's dark side \u2013 that leads to the most emotional moments.\n\nRobert De Niro (left) and Joe Pesci are de-aged for their characters' 1950s-set scenes in \"The Irishman.\" (Photo: NETFLIX)\n\nPesci's Bufalino is a cool customer who icily handles business \u2013 a polar opposite to his well-known \"Goodfellas\" role but no less effective. And a fantastic Pacino goes, well, full Pacino as Hoffa, an unbalanced, eccentric guy who held almost absolute power among America's labor unions.\n\nSince 1973's \"Mean Streets,\" Scorsese has proven over and over to be a master of the gangster film, and \"The Irishman\" has everything a crime lover would want, from violence and tension to an intriguing mundaneness. (One scene finds Frank strategizing the best handguns to pull off a job like one would pack for a weekend getaway.)\n\nWhat's wonderfully explored here, though, isn't the killer streak but instead the gravity of taking a darker path and being left at the end with nothing but bloody memories.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/29/the-irishman-review-robert-de-niro-martin-scorsese/2484232001/", "description": "Martin Scorsese proves a mob-drama master again with 'The Irishman,' a film about the emotional toll of a life of crime starring Robert De Niro.", "authors": ["Brian Truitt", "Published A.M.
