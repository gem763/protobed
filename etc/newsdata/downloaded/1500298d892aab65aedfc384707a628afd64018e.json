There\u2019s no \u201ccancel culture\u201d pressure from progressives on social media today urging Bloomberg to stand firm in the face of righty attacks on their hit piece about Labor Department attorney Leif Olson. Bloomberg is refusing to restract for reasons I can only call \u201cTrump logic,\u201d that it\u2019s bad to apologize even when the entire world knows you\u2019re wrong.\n\nAsked Bloomberg for a comment on the @benjaminpenn story on Leif Olson. https://t.co/Nt7fQGxMUT The response is unsurprising and highly disappointing: pic.twitter.com/oX1c9a8wcI \u2014 ErikWemple (@ErikWemple) September 3, 2019\n\nI repeat a point from this morning\u2019s post: The fact that the DOL shamefully forced Olson out apparently without considering the substance of the charges against him doesn\u2019t magically make Bloomberg\u2019s hatchet job meritorious. They share blame for the injustice; one\u2019s unjustness doesn\u2019t redeem the other\u2019s. Also, are we to understand from the statement given to Wemple that Bloomberg would now have to admit error if the DOL belatedly admitted error and rehired Olson? It\u2019s a strange thing for a media organization to take its ethical cues from a government agency.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not just right-wingers who believe Bloomberg is in the wrong here. Vox has a post up about Olson being \u201cfalsely accused\u201d of anti-semitism. Other lefties are chiming in on Twitter:\n\nI\u2019m not endorsing Olson or his policies, and I\u2019m sure he has all kinds of objectionable beliefs. But firing him as an anti-Semite over this post strikes me as terribly unfair. \u2014 Jonathan Chait (@jonathanchait) September 3, 2019\n\nAmazing. The headline said \u201canti-Semitic Facebook posts\u201d about posts that are not anti-Semitic. Even then, the story did not include the basic facts readers would need to judge the posts for themselves, namely anything about the specific election Olson was referring to. https://t.co/SZPf7EeHVj \u2014 Benjy Sarlin (@BenjySarlin) September 3, 2019\n\nSarlin\u2019s point about Bloomberg withholding key context to make Olson\u2019s joking comments seem sinister is a good one, and has been noted by others. Trump fans are outraged, as are hardcore Never Trump sites like the Bulwark. The smear is so plain that even a political culture like ours that requires taking sides on every controversy can\u2019t muster dissent this time.\n\nOnly one person seems happy with the report. That\u2019s Bloomberg reporter Ben Penn, who got the scalp of a right-wing Trump appointee and is happy to show it off.\n\nLost in all of this is that Olson was part of a team of political appointees tasked with the heavy lift of drafting wage-hour regulations that are high priorities for Trump White House, business community. They're now down one adviser. https://t.co/PZbIScDHqe \u2014 Ben Penn (@benjaminpenn) September 3, 2019\n\nOlson may be innocent of anti-semitism, but of the steeper offense of crimes against leftism he stands guilty as charged. By the close of business today, this may end up being a rare case of a news organization flatly admitting, \u201cWe whacked this guy for no better reason than that he\u2019s right-wing.\u201d Michael Brendan Dougherty wrote of the incident, \u201cIdeological activists working at putatively \u2018neutral\u2019 news outlets now use a standard of miscontrual. If any of your remarks can be read in bad faith, if any of them can be misconstrued, it is the duty of the reporter to misconstrue them for the public. This standard is fatal to real journalism.\u201d That\u2019s the standard Bloomberg is sticking with, for now. If a smear serves the Resistance by taking a soldier for Trump\u2019s agenda off the field then it did its job.\n\nI share Phil Kerpen\u2019s curiosity about what, precisely, Penn sent to the Department of Labor and the Anti-Defamation League when he asked for comment. Did he send the entire Olson Facebook thread or just pull the most incendiary lines completely out of context? Maybe the ADL will admit fault in this case and let us know. While we wait for that, and perhaps for a presidential tweet to come, compare Bloomberg\u2019s handling of this incident to the New York Times\u2019s recent habit of leaping to address lefty grievances against the paper. Today\u2019s error is far more clear-cut than anything the Times has retreated on lately, with no partisan disagreement on the question of whether it should be corrected. Yet Bloomberg refuses.
