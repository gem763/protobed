His slim suits have been replaced with T-shirts, mirrored sunglasses and a bucket hat. An alternative title could be \u201cComedians on Hikes Getting Winded.\u201d\n\nThree seasons into the show, which returned this month on YouTube, Nealon says he\u2019s exhausted his long list of comedian friends and has now had to start reaching out to publicists to book celebrity guests. Sometimes, publicists will even reach out to him. This past week\u2019s premiere had an unusually revealing conversation with Alec Baldwin, and upcoming episodes will feature hikes with Lisa Kudrow, Tiffany Haddish, and Christian Slater among other Hollywood stars.\n\nOccasionally a guest will agree to go on the hike only if the trail is flat. \u201cI call those my flatliners,\u201d Nealon jokes. For instance, he said his former SNL castmate David Spade would only go if the hike was \u201cperfectly flat\u201d and ended up complaining\u2014comically\u2014whenever there was a slight incline.\n\nBefore he started making the show, Nealon would mostly go on hikes alone. When he would pass people hiking together on the trail, he would notice that they were \u201calways in these deep conversations.\u201d He thought to himself, \u201cThere\u2019s something about hiking where you\u2019re not having eye contact and you\u2019re outdoors and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the endorphins or what but you\u2019re much more revealing.\u201d\n\nHe originally filmed the episodes with a selfie stick and his iPhone and has since upgraded to a more advanced GoPro with an external mic. When his guests arrive to the trailhead, they\u2019ll often ask, \u201cWhere\u2019s the crew?\u201d He has to explain that it\u2019s just the two of them alone in nature.\n\nHighlights from our conversation are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts, the Himalaya app or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nOn the origins of \u2018Hiking with Kevin\u2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a canyon near my house where I like to hike and that\u2019s where I do all my meditating and thinking and writing. When I\u2019m walking, my mind is a lot more open to ideas. So I called a friend of mine, the actor Matthew Modine, and I said, \u2018Hey, Matt, you want to go for a little hike?\u2019 So he comes up and we go for a hike and it\u2019s kind of an arduous hike. It\u2019s a big loop and it\u2019s pretty steep and we\u2019re almost to the top and we\u2019re both out of breath and our sentences are fragmented and I thought this would be funny if I was interviewing him and I videotaped it and you couldn\u2019t understand what either of us were saying.\u201d\n\nOn his hike with former Senator Al Franken\n\n\u201cHe was very still raw from everything that went down. And probably still is kind of recoiling from all that and getting back on his feet. We went to lunch afterwards and it was like he was going through a breakup with his girlfriend, staring off sometimes. Because he loved what he did and he was really good at it. And a lot of people are saying that he left too soon, he should have stayed. So I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s sort of regretting leaving so quickly, but the situation at the time with Roy Moore, it\u2019s almost like the Democrats had to throw a sacrificial lamb out there. I think he should have stayed longer, at least had some sort of congressional investigation.\u201d\n\nHow Dana Carvey helped him land on \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really on my radar because I knew I\u2019d never get on there\u2014because I didn\u2019t do impressions or characters. Dana Carvey, who I shared a house with in the Hollywood Hills, he recommended me. He got on the show that summer [of 1986] and I was really excited for him. Out of the blue, he calls me and says, \u2018I\u2019m out at Lorne Michaels\u2019 house and they\u2019re still looking for one more cast member and I told him about you.\u2019 First he goes, \u2018Guess who\u2019s in the kitchen? Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd.\u2019 I said, \u2018You\u2019re kidding!\u2019 Anyway, he says, \u2018I think Lorne\u2019s going to want to see your audition tapes.\u2019 I said, \u2018Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd are in the kitchen?\u2019 I didn\u2019t even hear the other stuff, it didn\u2019t register, because I knew I\u2019d never get on that show. So I sent them in and then a couple of weeks later, Dana calls and says, \u2018I\u2019m back out at Lorne Michaels\u2019 house, guess who\u2019s in the kitchen? Steve Martin!\u2019 I said, \u2018You\u2019re kidding me!\u2019 Anyway, he says, \u2018Lorne liked your tapes, I think they\u2019re going to fly you in for an audition.\u2019 I said, \u2018Steve Martin\u2019s in the kitchen?!\u2019\u201d\n\nOn appearing in the iconic Chippendales sketch with Chris Farley and Patrick Swayze\n\n\u201cAt the time, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to live on. Because everything is happening so quickly and you\u2019re trying to survive and you\u2019re doing your best. That was definitely a sketch that kind of cemented the idea of Saturday Night Live and what it was all about back then. And that was just one of those sketches that will never go away. I never really broke up [laughing] on SNL, now it seems pretty commonplace for them to break up. And Lorne always said that was really hacky. That probably was the closest I ever came to cracking up. But yeah, I remember doing that and it was me, Jan Hooks, Mike Myers, Patrick Swayze, and Chris Farley. And sadly, all of those people are gone now except for Mike Myers. But it was fun and in hindsight\u2014and I didn\u2019t know this at the time\u2014but I think Chris Farley was really reticent about whether he should do it or not. I think he was a little self-conscious about his weight. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time, I just thought this was a guy who just wants to get laughs no matter what happens.\u201d\n\nWhen he knew it was time to leave SNL\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you ever get really comfortable or secure. Getting [\u201cWeekend Update\u201d] was almost another layer of fear of getting fired. Eventually I did three years of that and then I was replaced by Norm Macdonald and left the following year. I had been there for eight seasons at that point and I did one more season after that. I appreciated the show, I loved the show. But I was even going out and doing sketches with food in my mouth from the craft service table. That\u2019s how lackadaisical I was about it. I thought it\u2019s time. And also the cast had gotten so big and they were looking to clean house. I was kind of pushed out too. I know [Chris] Farley was kind of fired and [Adam] Sandler that year was fired. I was essentially kind of forced out. I knew they probably wouldn\u2019t bring me back if I wanted to. So the writing was on the wall. I had been there for a while, they saw all my tricks. And I got it. I really didn\u2019t want to stay any longer, I had my fill of it.\u201d\n\nNext week on The Last Laugh podcast: Stand-up comedian Bill Burr.", "description": "On this week\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Last Laugh\u201d podcast, comedian Kevin Nealon talks about his YouTube series \u201cHiking with Kevin\u201d and explains how he knew it was time to leave \u2018SNL\u2019.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568068526/190909-wilstein-last-laugh-tease_c1hbxl", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
