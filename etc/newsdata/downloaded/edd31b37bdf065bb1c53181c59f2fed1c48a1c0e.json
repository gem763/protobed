But overall it\u2019s part of the game. I\u2019ve been around now for a long, long time. It\u2019s just how the tide turns sometimes.\u201d\n\nVettel came into the Singapore weekend under pressure, after a messy outing at Monza where he spun off in an unforced error and was sanctioned by stewards for rejoining the track in a dangerous manner.\n\nLeclerc, his 21-year-old team mate in only his first season with Ferrari and second in Formula One, meanwhile won the hearts of the team\u2019s passionate fans by handing the Italians their first win on home soil since 2010.\n\nA week earlier he had scored Ferrari\u2019s first win of the season in Belgium, prompting talk that he was now the team\u2019s number one.\n\nIn contrast, Vettel\u2019s slump in form had fuelled speculation, despite his statements to the contrary, that he might not see out his Ferrari contract which runs to the end of 2020.\n\nDespite the slightly controversial nature of his win in Singapore, after he benefited from Ferrari\u2019s strategy to pit earlier than Leclerc, it was clear how much it meant to the German.\n\n\u201cI just got a lot of energy in the last couple of weeks from messages that I received from the racing world, from people that I know from a long time ago but especially fans,\u201d said Vettel.\n\n\u201cWhen you read through some of the notes and people\u2019s struggles in life, some very intimate and private, it gets to you and it gave me a lot of belief and just confidence to just keep trying.\u201d\n\nDamon Hill, the 1996 world champion who was a big rival of Vettel\u2019s boyhood hero Michael Schumacher, hailed his return to the top.\n\n\u201cI think there were a lot of people looking at this race and saying the guy is finished,\u201d the Briton told Sky Sports television.\n\n\u201cSome people were saying he\u2019s never going to come back from that (Monza nightmare). Well, he did today.\u201d", "description": "Sebastian Vettel waited more than a year for his 53rd Formula One victory but, although written off by some critics, the Ferrari driver never doubted it would come.", "authors": ["Abhishek Takle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432693880&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0Q8", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
