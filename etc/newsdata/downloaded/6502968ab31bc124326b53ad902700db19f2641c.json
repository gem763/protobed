I\u2019ve pitched through so much crap in my career that would be easy to pitch through at this point. This is literally impossible to do anything with.\u201d\n\nScherzer was supposed to start Sunday\u2019s Game 5 of the World Series for the Washington Nationals, with the series tied 2-2. Scherzer was scratched and Joe Ross will start instead.\n\nScherzer said the injury is more than a muscle spasm \u2014 it also affects the nerve.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a muscle spasm. In talking to the doctors here, the nerve that\u2019s in the neck is all jammed up,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cThankfully, from the doctors, what they say is as long as I have no numbness coming down my arms or anything, you don\u2019t actually deal with any serious, any long-term damage here.\u201d\n\nThe three-time Cy Young winner said he\u2019s dealt with neck spasms before, but none as painful as this current bout. He also emphasized that it\u2019s in no way related to the lower back pain that sidelined him for most of July.\n\nThe spasms are happening on the right side of his neck, which affects his throwing arm. He was sporting a bandage on that side of his neck from receiving a cortisone shot, but that will take 48 hours to kick in.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t pick up my arm right now. So I can\u2019t pitch,\u201d Scherzer said.\n\nMonday is a day off as the Nationals and Houston Astros travel from the District to Houston before Game 6 takes place Tuesday. Manager Dave Martinez confirmed that Stephen Strasburg will still start that game, but if Scherzer\u2019s condition improves by then, he could come out of the bullpen that night.\n\nAnd \u201cif we go to Game 7, Max starts Game 7,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
