The Trump Organization had tried to stop the government from putting up windmills off the coast of the Aberdeen course. A Scottish court ruled earlier this year that the Trump Organization, which lost the case, had to pay the government\u2019s legal costs.\n\nA Scottish government spokesman said on Tuesday that the government was waiting for a court-appointed auditor to determine the specific amount owed by the company, which has challenged the government\u2019s estimate.\n\n\"We expect payment when this has been completed,\" spokesman Stephen Martin said.\n\nTurnberry is the larger and more famous of the two courses. Trump bought the historic links course \u2014 the site of four British Opens \u2014 in 2014 and has spent more than $200 million to buy and renovate the property and sustain its losses.\n\nIn its filing, the Trump Organization touted Turnberry\u2019s \u201ctremendous success\u201d in the company\u2019s fifth full year operating the resort. The company said revenue in 2018, $22.5 million, was higher than any year in the course\u2019s history. But the company also lost $13 million for the year, more than tripling its 2017 loss of $4.1 million. Turnberry has not turned a profit since Trump has owned it.\n\nMany people who live around the resort are happy with how the Trump Organization has pumped money into the property to rebuild the hilltop hotel, with its vast ballroom full of chandeliers, and renovate the seaside lighthouse that is open to the public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been better,\u201d said Sonya Brown, who owns the nearby Wildings Hotel and Restaurant and regularly attends parties and events at Turnberry. \u201cHe\u2019s revamped everything.\u201d\n\nBut the Trump Organization has also faced criticism at Turnberry for mixing politics and business. U.S. Air Force crews on layovers at the nearby Glasgow Prestwick Airport have spent nearly $200,000 at the hotel over the past two years. Some residents also oppose the company\u2019s plans to expand into residential development on nearby farmland.\n\nTrump\u2019s other Scottish course, along the blustery northeastern coast near Aberdeen, also struggled, losing $1.3 million in 2018, its seventh consecutive year of losses, according to financial disclosures. In 2017, the Aberdeen course lost $1.5 million.\n\nIn Aberdeen, the Trump Organization is now trying to bolster its golf revenue by becoming a residential home builder. Last month, the company won approval from a local council to build up to 550 houses and a second golf course in the area.\n\nThat proposal has prompted widespread opposition around Balmedie, the nearest village. More than 3,000 people wrote to the Aberdeenshire Council to criticize the plan. In the past, the company had pledged to build a large hotel on the site. That has not been built, and some doubt the Trump Organization will follow through on its home-building ambitions.\n\n\u201cIf it goes ahead, and that is a very big if, it will destroy the life of Balmedie as a village,\u201d said David Milne, who lives near the Aberdeen course and has long opposed the Trump Organization.\n\nSince Trump became president, his company has lost hotels in Panama, Toronto and New York\u2019s SoHo neighborhood, as the building owners severed ties with the brand.", "description": "Golf courses Trump purchased in Turnberry and near Aberdeen have yet to turn a profit.", "authors": ["Joshua Partlow", "National", "Foreign Affairs.
