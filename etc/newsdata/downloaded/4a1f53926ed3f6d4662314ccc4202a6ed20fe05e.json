It ranks the 50 most popular boys' and girls' names, based on data from the national registry of births. Here's the full list!\n\nChoosing the right name for your baby is tougher than it sounds. You probably don't want an overly weird name lest your child gets teased at school. On the other hand, nobody wants to be saddled with a boringly common name like John or Chris (thanks for nothing, Mum!)\n\nInstead, most parents plump for something that sits between unique and familiar. If you're stumped for ideas, McCrindle's list of top 100 baby names for boys and girls is well worth a look.\n\nBelow are the 50 most popular boys and girls name in Australia during 2019. (The number in brackets represents how many times each name was registered by new parents.)\n\nTop girl names in Australia: 2019\n\nCharlotte (1673) Olivia (1454) Amelia (1437v Ava (1436) Mia (1391) Isla (1253) Grace (1102) Harper (1037) Chloe (1027) Willow (1009) Zoe (960) Ella (928) Matilda (922) Emily (912) Sophie (901) Ruby (899) Isabella (894) Ivy (886) Evie (880) Evelyn (866) Sophia (809) Lily (770) Georgia (759) Aria (756) Lucy (750) Mila (717) Hannah (712) Sienna (674) Scarlett (663) Layla (638) Zara (618) Isabelle (590) Abigail (588) Emma (582) Audrey (561) Alice (543) Eva (543) Hazel (509) Violet (502) Ellie (432) Poppy (430) Stella (427) Emilia (419) Frankie (415) Florence (411) Sofia (405) Daisy (390) Elsie (389) Aurora (383) Eleanor (375)\n\nTop boy names in Australia: 2019\n\nOliver (2134) Jack (1778) William (1768) Noah (1622) Henry (1313) Thomas (1272) Leo (1223) Lucas (1131) James (1103) Liam (1069) Ethan (1065) Harrison (1061) Alexander (1053) Charlie (1044) Mason (1010) Harry (984) Hunter (968) Hudson (956) Elijah (936) Levi (909) Max (884) Oscar (852) Lachlan (844) Theodore (844) Archer (836) Cooper (801 Isaac (794) Samuel (777) Archie (766) Xavier (764) Logan (744) Jacob (735) Benjamin (710) George (708) Ryan (705) Joshua (697) Harvey (687) Sebastian (670) Arlo (643) Lincoln (634) Finn (631) Jackson (595) Luca (590) Hugo (588) Edward (574) Patrick (567) Jaxon (564) Riley (555) Eli (551) Daniel (536)\n\nAs you can see from the above list, a whopping 2134 boys were named Oliver last year while 1673 girls were named Charlotte. If you're thinking about either of those names, you might want to have a rethink as there are going to be a lot of Olivers and Charlottes wandering playgrounds in years to come.\n\nIf you're really fixated on one of the above names, you might want to consider alternative spellings to give it a modicum of originality. (Just don't make it too wanky.)\n\nNames that entered the top 100 for the first time included Leonardo, Maxwell, Christian, Adeline and Thea. Need more baby name suggestions?
