We obviously made a collective decision at halftime to come back out and play the game and see if anything changed.\u201d\n\nHis England team mate Raheem Sterling, who scored two of the goals, said on Twitter that he felt sorry for Bulgaria \u201cto be represented by such idiots in their stadium.\u201d\n\nDefender Harry Maguire added on his Twitter feed: \u201cThe best way to bounce back. Proud of the team. There\u2019s no place in football for that - disgraceful behaviour. Something must be done.\u201d\n\nJesse Lingard, who was not in the England squad for the match, said: \u201cEvery one of those @England boys are stronger than those who chose to destroy the beautiful game! @UEFA must do something about this! #Shameful\u201d\n\nHis Manchester United team mate Marcus Rashford, who scored the seventh-minute opener, thanked England\u2019s fans for their support.\n\n\u201cNot an easy situation to play in and not one which should be happening in 2019. Proud we rose above it to take three points but this needs stamping out,\u201d he said.\n\nRashford also praised Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov, who spent time talking to the home fans through the metal fence at the break.\n\n\u201cAlso been told what the Bulgaria captain did at halftime. To stand alone and do the right thing takes courage and acts like that shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed,\u201d he said.", "description": "England made a significant statement against racism by beating Bulgaria 6-0 in a Euro 2020 qualifier that was twice halted by the referee after abuse of the visiting players, manager Gareth Southgate said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440888700&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1XK", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
