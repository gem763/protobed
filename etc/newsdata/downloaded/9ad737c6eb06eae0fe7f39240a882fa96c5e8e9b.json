But one thing that comes along with us on the trip is our smartphone.\n\nWhether you like it or not, our phone is one of the main reasons to cause stress in our lives, but on a vacation, if you were given an option between checking your phone and a rejuvenating floating-pool massage with calming underwater music, what would you pick?\n\nMiraval Resort (with its outlets in Tuscon, Arizona and Austin, Texas) tries to give digital detox an entirely new perspective by offering experiences that one could enjoy at its establishment by letting-go of their phone in their hotel rooms -- making people realise how amazing screen-free life can truly be.\n\nMiraval Resort\n\nDon't Miss 41.2 K SHARES 4.7 K SHARES 4.4 K SHARES 775 SHARES 1.2 K SHARES\n\nOne can choose from over 140 weekly classes ranging from regular hiking, yoga, cooking lessons to more interesting options like painting animals using non-toxic paints, meditating alongside a horse, cardio drumming etc. An interesting option is floating meditation where one can meditate while floating on a silk hammock to calming music in the background.\n\nMiraval Resort\n\nFrom the moment you get down from your aircraft and into the shuttle to the resort, the staff calmly tries to instil the idea of life without smartphones and 'living in the moment'. While they don't forcefully confiscate your phone, they will ask you to turn your phone to 'Airplane Mode' and put them in 'sleeping bags' that they offer to commence the digital detox.\n\nVisitors are allowed to use their phones in their rooms, but not outside -- to eliminate the trigger for other visitors who are trying hard to detox. If you are found using the phones in premises, you'll be politely asked by staff to turn it off. They also have a library where people can borrow books instead of using e-readers.\n\nMiraval Resort\n\nAnne Parker, who works as a wellness counsellor at the Miraval Tuscon said in a statement to Fast Company, \"Habit change requires incremental change. Rarely do we just flip the switch and we're done. If people leave here and maybe it's only one small thing that they change, that's progress. That can lead to other changes over time. But unless there's something to sort of kickstart that first change, it's not gonna happen.\"\n\nWould you visit such a resort?
