It marked a shift in tone from a day earlier when he asserted that he could \"obliterate\" Turkey's economy if the country did anything \"out of line.\" Trump did not specify what that would entail.\n\nHow we got here: The White House announced late Sunday that Turkey will soon be launching a military operation in northern Syria and that U.S. troops will no longer be \"in the immediate area\" when it happens. The U.S. had more than 1,000 troops deployed in northern Syria, working closely with Kurdish-led forces that Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nSenators demand briefing: Sens. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamSusan Rice calls Trump decision to pull troops from Syria 'batshit crazy' Pat Robertson 'absolutely appalled' by Trump's Syria announcement Overnight Defense: Republicans urge Trump to reverse course on Syria | Dems subpoena Pentagon in impeachment probe | North Korea talks falter MORE (R-S.C.) and Christopher Coons Christopher (Chris) Andrew Coons2020 Democrats push for gun control action at forum O'Rourke hits Buttigieg over not supporting mandatory gun buybacks: 'It's time to lead' Democrats seize on whistleblower report to push for election security MORE (D-Del.) are demanding an all-senators briefing immediately on Trump's troop move.\n\n\"We are concerned that this was an abrupt decision taken in the face of reported opposition from military and diplomatic advisers, and that thousands of hardened ISIS fighters and thousands more ISIS supporters currently in detention may become free to fight again as their Kurdish captors turn to defending themselves against a Turkish incursion,\" Graham and Coons wrote in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellSusan Rice calls Trump decision to pull troops from Syria 'batshit crazy' Overnight Defense: Republicans urge Trump to reverse course on Syria | Dems subpoena Pentagon in impeachment probe | North Korea talks falter Trump defends Syria move: 'It's time to come back home' MORE (R-Ky.) and Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis Schumer Trump to hold Louisiana rally for GOP candidates in governor's race McCarthy shares 'Stranger Things' parody video criticizing impeachment 2020 Democrats push for gun control action at forum MORE (N.Y.).\n\nGraham, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee's foreign operations subpanel, and Coons, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, warned in Tuesday's letter that \"this action will give Turkey a greenlight to go into northeastern Syria under the guise of dealing with the continued threat of ISIS.\"\n\nThey warned Trump's decisions \"will have severe consequences for our strategic national interests and reduce American influence in the region while strengthening Turkey, Russia and Ira.\"\n\nThe senators also asserted that Trump's surprise move would increase the threat faced by Kurdish allies and hurt the United States' ability to build strategic alliances in the future.\n\nFormer commander delivers warning: The former commander of U.S. troops in the Middle East said Tuesday the President's decision to retreat from northeast Syria could add to the humanitarian crisis in the region and turn off potential future U.S. partners.\n\n\"For me, the overall sentiment is one of disappointment. Disappointment that we're letting down our partners, perhaps adding to the humanitarian disaster in this region, and that we may be ceding a hard-won strategic advantage to play a role in what is admittedly turning into a lengthy and difficult process to bringing a political solution to this troubled area,\" retired Gen. Joseph Votel, who was commander of U.S. Central Command until his retirement in March, said at an Atlantic Council event Tuesday.\n\n\"I believe that partnership is important. This partnership certainly is,\" he added later. \"It must however be nourished frequently and be based completely on mutual trust. I do believe yesterday's policy shift will make it more difficult to build partnerships in the future.\"\n\nIn addition to his remarks at the Atlantic Council, Votel also co-wrote an op-ed for the Atlantic with Middle East Institute nonresident fellow Elizabeth Dent in which they warned that Trump's move \"threatens to undo five years' worth of fighting against ISIS and will severely damage American credibility and reliability in any future fights where we need strong allies.\"\n\nPentagon says it was consulted: The Pentagon on Tuesday asserted that top defense officials were consulted prior to Trumps surprise announcement that U.S. troops would leave northeast Syria.\n\n\"Despite continued misreporting to the contrary, [Defense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperOvernight Defense: Republicans urge Trump to reverse course on Syria | Dems subpoena Pentagon in impeachment probe | North Korea talks falter Five things to know about Trump's decision on Syria, Turkey and the Kurds Pentagon insists US does not endorse Turkish operation in Syria MORE] and [Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley] were consulted over the last several days by the President regarding the situation and efforts to protect U.S. forces in northern Syria in the face of military action by Turkey,\" chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement.\n\nReports emerged Monday that top military officials were blindsided by Trump's decision.\n\nHoffman also said the Defense Department's position \"has been and remains that establishing a safe zone in northern Syria is the best path forward to maintaining stability.\"\n\nHe adds that the military has \"made no changes to our force presence in Syria at this time,\" and that U.S. troops were moved \"out of the path of potential Turkish incursion to ensure their safety.\"\n\nTurkey readies offensive: Turkey has bombed the Syrian-Iraqi border in anticipation of an offensive against Kurdish forces, Reuters reported Tuesday.\n\nTurkish officials told the outlet that their military on Monday night struck the border to prevent the Kurds from using the transit route to fortify their positions in the area. A security official said the intention was to cut off the road \"before the operation in Syria.\"\n\n\"In this way, the group's transit to Syria and support lines, including ammunition, are shut off,\" the official said.\n\nIt was unclear the extent of damage or whether there were any casualties following Turkey's strike on Monday night.\n\nThe strike was a joint operation by Turkey's intelligence service and the military, but details were contradictory, with one official telling Reuters it was an air strike and another describing the move as making the area \"unusable through various means.\"\n\nAnkara also said its plans for an offensive into Syria are now in place.\n\nSTATE ORDERS EU AMBASSADOR NOT TO TESTIFY BEFORE HOUSE: A key witness in the House impeachment inquiry was ordered not to appear at a scheduled deposition on Tuesday, ramping up tensions between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration.\n\nThe State Department instructed Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland not to appear for the deposition, according to his counsel.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) later lashed out at the State Department, saying Sondland has messages on a personal device that are relevant to the impeachment inquiry. He and the chairmen of two other House panels said they would issue a subpoena to Sondland.\n\nAbout the ambassador: Sondland, a wealthy hotelier who had donated $1 million to President Trump's inaugural committee before taking his government position, was a figure in the text messages released by Democrats last week that showed administration officials discussing Trump's communications with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump's efforts to pressure Zelensky to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenA dozen House Democrats call on EU ambassador to resign amid Ukraine scandal Ex-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown MORE and the business dealings of his son Hunter have become the impetus for the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSondland's response: Sondland's lawyer said his client was \"profoundly disappointed\" that the State Department did not allow him to testify and expressed hope that the issues raised by the agency would be resolved promptly to allow him to testify.\n\n\"Ambassador Sondland believes strongly that he acted at all times in the best interests of the United States, and he stands ready to answer the Committee's questions fully and truthfully,\" Robert Luskin, Sondland's lawyer, said in a statement.\n\nAs a sitting U.S. ambassador, Luskin said his client had no choice but to follow the State Department's direction. He noted that Sondland had traveled to Washington from Brussels to appear.\n\nThe background: Kurt Volker Kurt VolkerThe Hill's Morning Report - Bipartisan uproar over Trump's Syria move Democrats set to grill ambassador embroiled in Ukraine controversy A dozen House Democrats call on EU ambassador to resign amid Ukraine scandal MORE, the former special envoy to Ukraine, testified before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform committees last week and provided text messages between himself, Sondland and William Taylor, a top official in the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine\n\nSondland is shown in the text messages to be rejecting concerns from Taylor, a career diplomat, that Trump wanted the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt on the Bidens to help his reelection campaign. Sondland is also shown suggesting that the diplomats take their conversations offline.\n\nSchiff's response: Schiff said Tuesday morning that the State Department has not given Congress Sondland's personal device with pertinent messages.\n\n\"Not only is the Congress being deprived of his testimony, and the American people are being deprived of his testimony today, but we are also aware that the ambassador has text messages or emails on a personal device which have been provided to the State Department,\" Schiff told reporters. \"Although we have requested those from the ambassador and the State Department is withholding those messages as well. Those messages are also deeply relevant to this investigation and the impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nSchiff warned that blocking Sondland's testimony amounted to obstructing the investigation being conducted by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees.\n\nTrump defends blocking testimony: Trump on Tuesday defended his administration's decision to block Sondland from testifying, claiming he would have been testifying before a \"kangaroo court.\"\n\n\"I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican's [sic] rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see,\" Trump wrote in a series of tweets Tuesday morning.\n\nTrump tweeted shortly after news broke that the State Department had instructed Sondland not to appear before three House committees for closed-door testimony on Tuesday.\n\nRead about how Democrats were set to grill Sondland here.\n\nWHITE HOUSE TELLS LAWMAKERS IT WON'T COOPERATE WITH IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: The White House on Tuesday wrote to Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiEx-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown Former George W. Bush chief of staff endorses Trump impeachment inquiry MORE (D-Calif.) and three Democratic committee leaders to say it would not cooperate with the House's ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump, framing the investigation as an effort to \"overturn the results of the 2016 election.\"\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone accused House Democrats in an eight-page letter of making \"legally unsupported demands\" of the executive branch and accused them of violating the Constitution and past precedent in opening the impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n\n\"Given that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the Executive Branch cannot be expected to participate in it,\" Cipollone wrote.\n\n\"Because participating in this inquiry under the current unconstitutional posture would inflict lasting institutional harm on the Executive Branch and lasting damage to the separation of powers, you have left the President no choice.\"\n\n\"Consistent with the duties of the President of the United States, and in particular his obligation to preserve the rights of future occupants of his office, President Trump cannot permit his Administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances,\" he wrote.\n\nA bitter battle: The letter amounts to a directive to halt any cooperation with House Democrats and lays the foundation for what will be a bitter impeachment battle in the coming weeks.\n\nPelosi announced late last month that the House would formally launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump, alleging he abused his office by urging the Ukrainian president to \"look into\" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nDemocratic committee leaders have in recent days issued subpoenas demanding records from the White House, Vice President Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceTax-return whistleblower in spotlight amid impeachment fight Trump compares his impeachment to Clinton email server Defense chief on Ukraine: 'My aim is to keep the department apolitical' MORE, the Office of Management and Budget, the Pentagon and Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiA dozen House Democrats call on EU ambassador to resign amid Ukraine scandal Former George W. Bush chief of staff endorses Trump impeachment inquiry Giuliani associates won't comply with House impeachment inquiry, attorney says MORE as part of the investigation.\n\nThe administration has been increasingly unwilling to cooperate with requests for testimony and documents related to the burgeoning Ukraine scandal.\n\nTop Democrats have warned that the administration's failure to comply with their requests could be cited as obstruction in future articles of impeachment.\n\nThe issue: Responding to that argument, a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday that, \"asserting rights under the Constitution cannot ever properly be framed as obstruction of justice.\"\n\nThe letter released by the White House Tuesday evening describes the Democrats' impeachment inquiry as \"constitutionally invalid\" because it has not been authorized by a majority vote by the House of Representatives.\n\nThe White House argued that the lack of a formal vote is a break with precedent set in the impeachment inquiries into former Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonThis is the Clinton impeachment redux on a whole new toxic level Federal judge knocks DOJ stance that sitting president can't be indicted Federal judge rules against Trump in fight to keep tax records from Manhattan prosecutors MORE.\n\nA senior administration official declined to speculate on Tuesday as to whether Trump would cooperate if the House voted to authorize an impeachment inquiry, leaving open the possibility that the standoff would carry on regardless.\n\nThe letter also asserts that the three committees leading the impeachment inquiry have not afforded Trump the basic due process protections mandated by the Constitution, despite Pelosi's public assertion that the House would treat Trump with fairness.\n\nRead the administration's letter to Pelosi here.\n\nON TAP FOR TOMORROW\n\nThe Defense TechConnect Innovation Summit and Expo will feature speakers including Deputy Assistant Air Force Secretary for Operational Energy Roberto Guerrero and Daryl Haegley, principal cyber advisor to the defense secretary, at 8:30 a.m. in National Harbor, Md.\n\nAir Force Brig.
