Instead, he chose to use Uber and Lyft. His family still owned another car, but he primarily traveled via ride-sharing.\n\n\u201cPurchasing a car would cost several thousand dollars and getting a loan would have a monthly payment of at least $300 or more,\u201d said Farrington, who lives in San Diego and founded The College Investor. \u201cIf ride sharing didn\u2019t work, I would just buy a car.\u201d\n\nHis experiment proved to be a resounding success: He only spends between $100 and $200 per month on rides with Uber, and there\u2019s good availability in the suburbs. \u201cI definitely think it\u2019s a viable option as long as ride sharing is available and low cost,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Uber, 2 years after getting spanked, acts like a grown-up in its IPO\n\nForegoing car ownership in favor of services like Lyft LYFT, -7.57%, which went public last month, and Uber, which filed for an IPO late Thursday, is not a common choice. Only 9% of people who sold or traded in a vehicle over the past year decided not to get a new car and instead use ride-sharing services, a May 2017 poll conducted by Reuters and Ipsos found.\n\nAnd as these two giants of the ride-hailing industry take their companies public, new research suggests that services like Lyft and Uber might be putting more cars on the road and dissuading people from using public transit rather than addressing issues of congestion.\n\nUber and Lyft may be causing worse traffic in the country\u2019s biggest cities\n\nA July 2018 report from transportation consultant Bruce Schaller found that companies like Lyft and Uber added 5.7 billion miles of driving in the country\u2019s nine largest metropolitan areas \u2014 and car ownership rates climbed higher than the population in those areas. Moreover, ride-hailing services and taxis are expected to surpass busses in terms of ridership in 2018.\n\nCarpooling options, such as UberPOOL and Lyft Line, aren\u2019t any better at reducing traffic in city streets, he said. Schaller calculated that these shared services actually account for a 160% increase in driving in major cities.\n\nAlso see: How Uber and Lyft riders can stay safe after Samantha Josephson\u2019s murder\n\nAnd people aren\u2019t necessarily choosing Lyft or Uber instead of driving their own car. Instead, Schaller found that 60% of these services\u2019 users would have taken public transportation, walked, rode a bike or not traveled if they hadn\u2019t hailed a ride via an app.\n\nThat echoes research released last year by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York, which found that for-hire vehicle and taxi ridership grew 13.1% between 2016 and 2017 while subway ridership fell 1.7%.\n\nUber and Lyft dispute reports saying their services makes traffic worse\n\nUber argues that these criticisms ignore the benefits that such services provide. An Uber spokesperson noted that the use of for-hire vehicles in New York was growing most in the parts of the city that are not accessible by subway and fell in Manhattan where the new Second Avenue subway line was introduced.\n\nMoreover, Uber said that ride-hailing services have benefited residents of suburbs and small towns without extensive public transportation options. \u201cWe\u2019re growing in markets where there was no alternative to driving your own car, providing a vital lifeline to seniors and others unable to drive,\u201d a company spokesman said in an email to MarketWatch.\n\nRecommended: The government has no idea how many gig workers there are, and that\u2019s a problem\n\nA spokeswoman for Lyft also pointed to research from the Shared-Use Mobility Center, a nonprofit focused on transportation in urban areas, which showed that ride-sharing services fill in the gaps left by public transit. Specifically, the researchers suggested that these services could play a role in making public transportation more accessible through \u201cfirst/last mile partnerships,\u201d which would help people who live in areas not served by public transit get to a stop. \u201cLyft believes our cities need a spectrum of transportation options, including public transit and on-demand service,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\n\n\nAnd the amount of miles driven by personally-owned vehicles still far exceeds the amount driven by for-hire vehicles, including taxis, limousines and cars driven for Uber and Lyft, according to the National Household Travel Survey conducted by the Federal Highway Administration.\n\nCar-sharing could actually encourage people to ditch their vehicles\n\nPeople like Farrington represent just the tip of the iceberg. One study found that as many as 25% of current American drivers could benefit from ditching their vehicles in favor of ride-sharing services. Another study conducted by experts at University of California, Berkeley, suggested that each car-sharing vehicle replaces between 9 and 13 personally-owned vehicles.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just that people are choosing to get rid of their cars \u2014 many more people these days are just opting not to drive in the first place. Between 1983 and 2014, the percentage of people between the ages of 16 and 44 who held a driver\u2019s license decreased from 91.8% to 76.7%, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s Transportation Research Institute.\n\nAlso see: Distracted driving worries more people but not enough to change their own bad behavior\n\nThe shift away car ownership is even more notable when taking car-sharing services such as Zipcar and car2go into account. Unlike Lyft and Uber, which allow users to hail cars or carpool, car-sharing programs allow members to reserve a car they drive themselves. Users typically pay an hourly rate for the time they use a car, and there are sometimes recurring fees for a membership.\n\nWhile 43% of Zipcar members owned a car prior to joining, only 24% continue to do so after they\u2019ve joined, Zipcar said. Zipcar estimates that it has taken more than 400,000 cars off the road since it went into business. (Of course, it has a vested interest in people renting rather than buying automobiles.)\n\nUber is moving beyond ride-sharing\n\nIndeed, as part of its goal to reduce individual car ownership, Uber has begun to explore ways to expand its services beyond ride-sharing, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi outlined in a blog post last year.\n\n\u201cHaving a greater variety of transportation modes at your fingertips helps make it increasingly easy to live without a car,\u201d Khosrowshahi wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s why we want to provide alternatives to personal car ownership by bringing together multiple modes of transportation right in our app.\u201d\n\nRead more: Here\u2019s where you\u2019ll live when self-driving cars rule the roads\n\nThe company has begun to explore car-sharing and formed a deal with public transit mobile ticketing provider Masabi to allow Uber users to begin booking and using transit tickets through its app.\n\nAdditionally, Uber acquired bike-sharing start-up Jump, and in San Francisco the platform has proved so popular that Jump lowered the number of car rides taken during peak hours by 15%, the company said. The company also has devoted $1 million toward a campaign advocating for congestion pricing in New York City.\n\n(This story was updated on April 12, 2019.)", "description": "Uber\u2019s IPO may help investors\u2019 portfolios, but ride-sharing may hurt when it comes to traffic congestion.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FL173_NA_ube_ZG_20170425171446.jpg", "published_at": "2018-04-20"}
