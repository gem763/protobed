The final indignity was watching Sabathia, who had served this team so well for so long, trudging dejectedly off the mound, his career ending in pain and defeat.\n\nNow, the Yankees need to put together a three-game winning streak against the team that had the best record in baseball, and they need to win two of them at Minute Maid Park, where the Astros were the most difficult team to beat in both leagues.\n\nAnd while a win Thursday night would have meant the Yankees could have advanced by beating either Justin Verlander or Gerrit Cole, now they can only move on by beating Verlander and Cole.\n\nAaron Judge watches from the dugout during the eighth inning the Yankees Game 4 loss to the Houston Astros. (AP)\n\nStory continues\n\nFrank Sinatra may not be singing \u201cNew York, New York\u2019\u2019 for the final time quite yet, but he is certainly warming up those vocal cords.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve handled everything that\u2019s been thrown at us so far this season,\u2019\u2019 said DJ LeMahieu. \u201cI know we\u2019ll show up tomorrow and give it everything we\u2019ve got.\u2019\u2019\n\nThat may not be enough. In fact, the argument could be made that the Yankees gave it less than their best shot in Game 4.\n\nNot only did they fail to capitalize on two bases-loaded situations against Zack Greinke, who they nicked for three runs and two home runs in their 7-0 victory in Game 1, the Yankee bats struck out 13 times against a six-pack of Houston pitchers Thursday, stranded 10 runners and were unable to manage a single hit in seven tries with runners in scoring position.\n\nTheir best chance came in the bottom of the fifth when they loaded the bases for the second time with only one out \u2014 they did so in the first inning but could score only once, on a walk to Brett Gardner \u2014 trailing 3-1.\n\nGleyber Torres, the hitting star of Game 1 with five RBIs, struck out on a close check-swing call by home plate umpire Dan Bellino.\n\nThat brought up Edwin Encarnacion, who had been 1-for-13 with seven strikeouts to that point in the series. Before the game, Boone had said that Stanton, who had not played in the previous two games due to a quad strain suffered in Game 1, would be available to pinch-hit in the right situation.\n\nIf this wasn\u2019t the right situation \u2014 the bases juiced, two outs and the Yankees desperate for a big hit \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine what would be.\n\nAnd even if Boone was concerned about Stanton\u2019s ability to run \u2014 he didn\u2019t look very fleet on the basepaths in pregame warmups \u2014 you weren\u2019t looking for speed there, only power. Encarnacion can\u2019t run even when healthy. It would have been a straight-forward swap \u2014 power-for-power, gimp-for-gimp, DH-for-DH.\n\nBut Boone chose not to pull the trigger. Instead, he sent Encarnacion up, and the ensuing strikeout was as predictable as boos for Adam Ottavino. That ended the Yankees\u2019 last real chance to make a game of it. George Springer had hit a three-run homer off Masahiro Tanaka in the first, Carlos Correa hit a three-run jack off Chad Green in the sixth, and the Astros added two more late runs as the Yankees normally-solid defense devolved into low comedy.\n\nGary Sanchez\u2019s two-run shot in the bottom of the sixth \u2014 only his second hit in 17 at-bats this series \u2014 served as mere window-dressing for an overall performance almost too ugly to watch.\n\nAsked whether he had considered sending Stanton up to hit for Encarnacion in the fifth, the typically loquacious Boone clammed up. \u201cNo,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nWhy not?\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the situation I was considering,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBut Boone was downright chatty compared with Stanton, who brushed past a group of reporters waiting for him to dress at his locker.\n\nGot a moment, Giancarlo?\n\n\u201cNot right now,\u2019\u2019 he said, rushing out the door.\n\nThe same question keeps coming up to Yankees manager Aaron Boone: Why is Giancarlo Stanton on the roster if he's not going to at least pinch-hit? (Getty Images)\n\nThat raised the same question that was asked of Boone: If not now, then when?\n\nProbably next year. The game the Yankees had to win turned out to be one they almost seemed to be trying to lose. And for the past three games, they have been doing it with 24 men, because if Stanton didn\u2019t get into this game, he\u2019s probably not fit to get into any game.\n\nBoone addressed the team afterward, the gist of his message being that the Yankees have to win on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe need to flush this one immediately,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not the way we wanted to play tonight but we\u2019re not out of anything,\u2019\u2019 said LeMahieu, an MVP candidate during the season but a committer of two errors at first base in Game 4. \u201cOur backs are against the wall, but we just got to keep going.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cI feel bad but we have to try to forget tonight and focus on tomorrow,\u2019\u2019 said Torres, who committed two errors at second. \u201cWe\u2019re confident we can win. One hundred percent.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give a team like that too many opportunities but that\u2019s what we did and they capitalized,\u2019\u2019 chimed in Aaron Hicks, the Yankees\u2019 No. 3 hitter Thursday despite having had just five plate appearances since Aug. 3 due to an elbow injury. \u201cWe need to clean it up tomorrow.\u201d\n\nMaybe nothing the players or their manager did in Game 4 would have changed the outcome, and there\u2019s probably very little that can help them with Verlander, Cole and the end of their season looming.\n\nBut wouldn\u2019t it have been nice to see what might have been had Boone chosen to send his most dangerous hitter up in the most important moment of the game?\n\nThere\u2019s always next year, of course.\n\nOr, in the case of Stanton, the next eight years. What's the hurry?\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Yankees barely put up a fight in Game 4 of the ALCS, and are now on the brink of elimination.", "authors": ["Wallace Matthews"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TwYGwauwWDwm4plr.ZBRHQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTQuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CKi6fHVsK82xTkG29XsiVQ--~B/aD0xNDY4O3c9MjIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/15fb73f0-f171-11e9-99bc-72d59be52f75", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
