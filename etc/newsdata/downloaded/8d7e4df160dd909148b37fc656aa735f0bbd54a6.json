There's nothing set, it all comes down to that and the protection officer and the principal knowing each other well. It's all about that trust.\"\n\nMeghan Markle was criticized after a walkabout was cut short during her tour of Fiji in October last year. The reason behind this was never disclosed to the media, and this level of confidentiality is something that's quite common during royal tours, according to Morgan.\n\n\"Unless there's something to brief over, there's an unwritten understanding. If a protection officers says, 'we are leaving,' then we are leaving,\" he said.\n\n\"If no one else had an understanding of the thought process, then they won't know why the decision was made,\" Morgan added. \"The way the media perceives things is through the end product, not what led that decision to being made.\n\n\"The principal is accustomed to being part of a protection package, so the flow of communication between them and the protection officer should be the same as at any other event.\"\n\nMembers of the royal family have not toured Pakistan since Prince Charles and Camilla's visit in 2006. Since then, tensions have heightened between Pakistan and India over the Kashmir region, where both countries share a border.\n\nDuring a press conference at the United Nations annual summit in New York last month, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said \"there is potential that two nuclear armed countries will come face to face at some point.\"\n\n\"The tensions between India and Pakistan make the region unstable,\" Morgan said. \"There are a lot more factors you have to consider, compared to if you where just travelling to Manchester to open a new hospital.\n\n\"While the blueprint remains the same, lots of things will be specific to that area and the location they are staying in.\n\n\"There will be a lot of planning, a lot of risk assessment of the venues they are going to,\" he added. \"For instance, how they are arriving and how they are leaving a specific engagement. Whether there's any sensitivity around that venue.\n\n\"There will certainly be an element of secrecy and confidentiality surrounding where they are going and what they are seeing,\" he added.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Queen's royal protection officers reportedly use 'Sharon' as a secret codename for her when out in public\n\nEvery time Meghan Markle and Prince Harry broke royal protocol during their tour of Africa\n\nHere's how Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's first family royal tour is different from Prince William and Kate Middleton's\n\nKate Middleton just nailed the culotte trend by wearing a $108 pair from Jigsaw with a Chanel handbag and matching turtleneck sweater", "description": "The couple's visit to Pakistan will be their \"most complex tour\" to date, Kensington Palace said in a statement.", "authors": ["Mikhaila Friel"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da58ef7695b5807cd349209?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
