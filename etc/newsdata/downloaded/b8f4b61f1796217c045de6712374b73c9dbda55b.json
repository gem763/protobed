Or four.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cStarting pitching is absolutely our biggest strength,\u201d reliever Sean Doolittle said.\n\nAD\n\nIn other news, water is wet, grass is green, the earth is round and Stephen Strasburg\u2019s change-up is filthy.\n\nAD\n\nWe can spend the endless hours before Nationals Park hosts the first National League Championship Game in this city\u2019s history wondering whether center fielder Victor Robles will return to the Nats\u2019 lineup or how the Nats will hit St. Louis Cardinals right-hander Jack Flaherty. But the only analysis of this postseason that really matters at the moment, especially in the District, is that Washington\u2019s rotation encountered a knife fight and brought a bazooka. Or four.\n\nWe know the status of the best-of-seven series \u2014 the Nats with a 2-0 lead over the Cards, with the next three (if necessary) at home \u2014 is the direct result of An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez and Max Scherzer combining for 14-2/3 innings of two-hit ball over the first two games. Different pitchers. Different styles. Same result.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cJust seems like they were just playing catch out there,\u201d said Strasburg, who will get the ball to oppose Flaherty on Monday night.\n\nAD\n\nCatch, with a purpose. Before we get to the numbers, which are staggering, consider the visceral aspect of those performances not to us, as outsiders, but to those in the fight.\n\n\u201cWhen the starting pitching is cruising the way that these guys have done so far in this series, you do feed off that energy,\u201d Doolittle said after Saturday\u2019s 3-1 victory in Game 2. \u201cIt gives you some confidence that if you go in and attack, you can pick up where they left off and kind of carry that baton forward. We definitely feed off that energy. It\u2019s a very calming confidence.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt should be, especially considering that in this series alone, S\u00e1nchez and Scherzer have combined to get 44 outs, leaving relievers (which included left-handed starter Patrick Corbin for one batter Saturday) to get just 10. Less work for the bullpen equals less stress for everyone. It\u2019s a formula that\u2019s threatening to usher St. Louis right out of the postseason.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not been a lot of pitches to feast on,\u201d Cardinals Manager Mike Shildt said.\n\nEight games into this postseason, here are the categories in which Nats\u2019 starters lead their counterparts, along with some historical context, courtesy of Elias:\n\n\u2022 ERA, which is 1.81. Last year\u2019s Milwaukee Brewers were better at 1.64, but before that, you have to go back to the 1996 Atlanta Braves \u2014 a rotation fronted by Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and Tom Glavine. Trying to remember what those three have in common. Oh, right. They\u2019re all in the Hall of Fame.\n\nAD\n\n\u2022 Walks and hits per inning pitched, which is 0.87. Among teams that played at least eight postseason games, the most recent rotation with a better WHIP would be the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks. Recall who led that World Series-winning group? That would be Randy Johnson, five-time Cy Young winner and Hall of Famer, and Curt Schilling, six-time all-star.\n\nAD\n\n\u2022 Batting average against, as mentioned above, at .150. The closest to these Nats among teams with at least eight postseason games: those 2001 Diamondbacks (.175) and the 1972 Oakland Athletics, who were led by Catfish Hunter, a \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Hall of Famer, with contributions from Cy Young winner Vida Blue and all-stars Ken Holtzman and Blue Moon Odom.\n\nKind of amazing that this whole postseason run started with a walk and a homer and Scherzer in a hole just two batters into the wild-card game against the Brewers. Even more surprising that the fifth and decisive game of the division series began with a double and a homer and Strasburg in a hole against the Dodgers. Those two games, from the Nats\u2019 two best pitchers, are the only times a Nats\u2019 starter has allowed more than one earned run.\n\nAD\n\nThis all fits into a postseason that has been defined by starting pitching. On the night the Nats eliminated the Dodgers, L.A. right-hander Walker Buehler pushed himself to a career-high 117 pitches and allowed just one run in his two starts. The best starting pitcher in these playoffs probably isn\u2019t a Nat, but Houston right-hander Gerrit Cole, who has allowed one earned run in 15-2/3 innings, over which he has 25 strikeouts.\n\nAD\n\nAt 23, Flaherty was the NL\u2019s best pitcher of the second half (0.91 ERA), but the Cardinals have also received valiant efforts from 38-year-old Adam Wainwright, who nearly matched Scherzer in Game 2. The shakiest rotation in baseball\u2019s final four belongs to the New York Yankees, yet Masahiro Tanaka opened the American League Championship Series with six innings of one-hit, shutout ball against the Astros.\n\nIf those characters end up being the group that\u2019s remembered from this October, then the Nats feel like they\u2019ll fit right in \u2014 and maybe lead the way. The whole tenor had Mike Rizzo, the general manager and architect of these Nats, repeating what might be his favorite baseball axiom in a victorious clubhouse after Game 1: \u201cOnce you have starting pitching, anything is possible, and if you don\u2019t have it, nothing is possible.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nStrasburg is on the mound Monday, when what\u2019s possible is to take a three-game lead over the Cards. Corbin follows Tuesday, when the possibilities include \u2014 get this \u2014 a sweep. This October is about starting pitchers, and because the Nats have the best group \u2014 a potentially historic group \u2014 then there are no limits to what they can accomplish.\n\nAD\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "Through the first eight games of these playoffs, six of them wins, Washington\u2019s starting pitchers are allowing a .150 batting average.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vQkCktXXhACzjF7chPVMBWLmsaM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GYCTXIHK7YI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
