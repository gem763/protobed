Smith, the private-equity billionaire who pledged to wipe out the student-loan debt of the class of 2019 at Morehouse College, will cover debt taken on by the students\u2019 parents as well.\n\nThe college said Friday Mr. Smith and his family donated $34 million to a Morehouse program that will pay off students\u2019 and parents\u2019 loans.\n\n\u201cWith the Student Success Program in place, there is a model for all colleges and universities, starting with Morehouse and HBCUs, to receive gifts from alumni and other supporters that can offset the burden of student loans and give students the freedom to pursue their dreams, the capital to invest in the economic growth of their families and the time that they can give back meaningfully to strengthening their communities,\u201d Mr. Smith said in a statement, using an acronym for historically black colleges and universities.\n\nMr. Smith, who is CEO of Vista Equity Partners and one of the country\u2019s wealthiest African-Americans, said he would eliminate student debt while speaking at Morehouse\u2019s commencement in Atlanta in May, stunning the college and its students.\n\nMany graduates and their families wondered at the time if the generosity extended to parents who borrowed to pay for their education. Morehouse said Friday that the program would include so-called parent Plus loans, unsubsidized federal loans for parents of undergraduates.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely thrilled and cannot express the gratitude I have,\u201d said Athena Cross, a public-health consultant in Washington, D.C. \u201cI\u2019m lost for words.\u201d Her son, Cameron, has $65,000 in student debt. Ms. Cross took out approximately $44,000 in parent Plus loans, which have a higher interest rate than student loans.\n\n\u201cA big part of the debt that I tried to take on [was to] to keep my son in school,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the 2017-2018 school year, 45% of parents of students at Morehouse College took out parent Plus loans, according to Mark Kantrowitz of Savingforcollege.com. Among four-year colleges broadly, 9% of parents used parent Plus loans in that school year.\n\n\u201cParent Plus loans are a big problem,\u201d said Caitlin Zaloom, an associate professor at New York University and author of \u201cIndebted: How Families Make College Work at Any Cost.\u201d Prof. Zaloom said the loans are risky offerings, in part because they allow parents to borrow large sums at high interest rates.\n\nMorehouse parents borrowed an average $29,000 in parent Plus loans during the 2017-2018 school year, according to an analysis of federal data. That was higher than the average parent Plus loan at about 98% of other U.S. colleges, and the second highest among all HBCUs following Spelman College, the Journal found.\n\n\u201cRobert understands that the debt burden that\u2019s incurred when you put a young man through Morehouse doesn\u2019t only fall on students, but also on families,\u201d said Morehouse\u2019s president, David A. Thomas.\n\nTanza Cooper, a Morehouse parent, took out $100,000 in parent Plus loans for her son John\u2019s tuition. The loan put her and her husband in a tough financial situation. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize after adding everything up how much it really was,\u201d Ms. Cooper said before Friday\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s coming out of the household and other bills we have to pay.\u201d She said she was excited after learning about the new plan.\n\nParent Plus loans have been an important part of Morehouse College\u2019s funding. HBCUs typically have small endowments and rely heavily on student tuition to operate. In 2011, the Obama administration tightened the rules for parent Plus loans in an effort to curb high default rates. The rule change resulted in a budget shortfall at Morehouse that forced the school to furlough its faculty and staff for a week.", "description": "Robert F.
