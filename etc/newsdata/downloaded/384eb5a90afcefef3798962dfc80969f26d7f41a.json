Neither he nor Ms Arcuri have responded to claims that she told friends at the time that they were in an intimate relationship.\n\nOversight committee chair Len Duvall said: \u201cThe role of the London Assembly is to ensure that City Hall is above question and we must abide by the ethos of complete openness and transparency.\n\n\u201cWe did finally receive a response from Boris Johnson, through his solicitors, which they have indicated may not be published. At this stage we are respecting that, but we are seeking further clarification.\n\n\u201cNothing in the response, in our opinion, reflects the need for confidentiality. In fact, the response is insufficient as far as our request for information is concerned.\n\n\u201cWe are focussed on our investigation and considering next steps. A number of options are open to us; they include speaking to various people and using our power of summons.\u201d\n\nMr Duvall said the committee was liaising with the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which has been asked by the GLA to look into whether Mr Johnson could face a charge of misconduct in public office.\n\nA decision on whether to issue a summons is likely to be made at the oversight committee\u2019s scheduled meeting on 16 October.", "description": "Information provided by Boris Johnson to an inquiry into his relations with a US businesswoman as London mayor has been deemed \u201cinsufficient\u201d to resolve issues raised.
