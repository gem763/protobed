And yet, what was once a staple of American life is often skipped in modern homes. What happened to the porch?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sociological, it\u2019s aesthetic, technological, it has all the different aspects of life,\u201d says Renee Kahn, a historic preservationist and retired art history professor who, with the architectural designer Ellen Meagher, authored the 1990 book \u201cPreserving Porches.\u201d She explains that the porch became possible after the Industrial Revolution when manufacturing made prefabricated parts easy to come by. The growth of leisure time in the 1800s made the idea of a place to relax and socialize particularly appealing.\n\nPorches became a staple of Southern architecture in part because of the respite they provided from stifling heat. \u201cThe first porch buildings in the U.S. had more to do with climate, with environment, than social issues,\u201d said architect and University of Miami professor Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk. She adds that porches shaded the house walls, which meant less heat inside the home in the pre-air-conditioning era. Porches also acted as a cool, outdoor living space, she said. Homes That Put Porches Front and Center A look at five houses with front porches around the country. A waterfront home set on 1.5 acres in Nantucket has a wraparound porch. It is listed for $7.8 million. Susan A. Lee 1 of 10 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 1 of 10 Show Caption A waterfront home set on 1.5 acres in Nantucket has a wraparound porch.

Up until then, you could sit on a porch at night and chat with your neighbors. It was social. It was pleasant,\u201d she says. Once autos showed up, people began building side porches instead of front porches, she says, but then \u201cwith air conditioning and television, the whole thing disappears all together. That marks the end of the porch.\u201d Professor Plater-Zyberk believes that the front porch fuses a connection between homeowners to their neighbors and those passing by on the street. \u201cI think part of what people have feared in the last number of decades is the loss of the sense of community because we\u2019re always in our car or in front of the TV. We\u2019ve lost the activities, especially connected to walking, which enables us to foster human relations that are informal and supportive in that manner that\u2019s now called connectivity,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really a social necessity at one point. I don\u2019t see them any more on the new buildings that are going up and if they\u2019re there, nobody sits on them,\u201d says Ms. Kahn. She advocates that existing porches never be removed from homes. \u201cMy analogy is, you take a porch off of the front of a house and it\u2019s like shaving off somebody\u2019s eyebrows,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a key form of showing expression.\u201d\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
