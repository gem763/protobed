(AP/Bill Feig)\n\nBrees has already completed passes to six receivers, including four each to Murray, who has been getting more playing time with Alvin Kamara sidelined, and Michael Thomas.\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t slow down: New Orleans pulled away from Arizona in the second half, winning 31-9 to record their sixth straight win.\n\nBrees finished the afternoon 34-of-43 (79.1 percent) for 373 yards, with three touchdowns and one interception.\n\n\u201cFelt really good,\u201d Brees said. \u201cObviously the last five weeks have been tough, just rehabbing, just trying to get healthy again. Early on, I felt like there was a lot of excitement, shaking the rust off a little bit. ...I was hoping this would be the week; this was the week that I had in my mind from the moment that I got hurt.\n\n\u201cThe doctors and everybody were saying after the bye week, but I was trying to fast-track that as much as possible, understanding that there\u2019s a healing process that needs to take place. A lot of it was just the ability to get a grip on the ball and be able to throw the ball accurately and be myself and not think about it. So as soon as I could grip it and rip it, I wanted to play. I wanted to be out there with my teammates.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nPer usual, Thomas was his favorite target, as the receiver had 11 catches for 112 yards and a score. Thomas was one of nine Saints who caught at least one pass; gadget player Taysom Hill had three catches for 63 yards and a receiving touchdown and Murray finished with 157 yards from scrimmage and two total touchdowns.\n\nNew Orleans is 7-1 and will now enjoy its bye week.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Brees missed five games after suffering torn ligaments in the thumb of his throwing hand.", "authors": ["Shalise Manza Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_ASEXGcWMnezLVdYSkOEAg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y.VTNIsA39YArpL6z2tC3A--~B/aD0zMzI2O3c9NDk5MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/c053e8e0-f8e3-11e9-8bff-24da25856177", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
