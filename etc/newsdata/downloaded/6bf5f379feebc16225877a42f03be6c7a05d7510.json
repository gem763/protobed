On a large cutting board, use a sharp knife and cut all the way around the avocado. Make sure you\u2019re hitting the seed. Wiggle and twist the avocado so that it pulls apart and you have two halves.\n\n2. Keep your avocado on the cutting board and slice the avocado longways first. Then turn it width-wise and slice across. Don\u2019t cut through the skin.\n\n3. To get the pit out, stick your knife right into the pit. Wiggle and twist the knife so that the pit is pulled out smoothly. Again, keep the avocado on the cutting board to avoid avocado hand.\n\n4. Once the pit is out, slice this half of the avocado the same as the other half: slice longways and then slice width-wise. Don\u2019t cut through the avocado\u2019s skin.\n\n5. Take a spoon and scoop the avocado out of both halves. Throw it onto a salad or salsa or use the diced pieces to prep or make a chunkier guacamole.", "description": "Cutting avocados doesn\u2019t have to leave a bloody mess.
