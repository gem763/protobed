A few weeks ago, I shared some of my favorite kitchen uses for non-culinary tools, and I asked the crowd for more ideas. Below, I\u2019ve collected some of the best.\n\n[Eight non-culinary tools you can use in the kitchen]\n\nClothespins. FarmerR suggests these for closing plastic bags. They can be cheaper to buy in bulk than binder clips.\n\nInfrared thermometer. If you want to check the temperature of oil for frying, Gussie Fink-Nottle recommends this no-contact thermometer. I can confirm this works, after testing my recipe for Takeout-Style Sweet and Sour Chicken.\n\nGoggles. Claudia A. Dillman wears ski goggles and a painter\u2019s mask when removing the seeds from peppers. Carrie Lianne likes swim goggles for chopping onions. \u201cThere\u2019s the added bonus of embarrassing your teenager when they walk into the kitchen with a friend and you\u2019re wearing your kitchen goggles,\u201d she adds.\n\nRubber mallet. Multiple readers use this to flatten meat. Says carolwebb, \u201cSandwiched between sheets of parchment paper, all it takes is a few whacks and you\u2019re done.\u201d Phildecarp uses one to tap a cleaver through hard squashes.\n\nNeedle-nose pliers. Lots of readers use this standard tool to pull bones out of fish. Thomas A Horsley pries plastic seals off bottles with them, too. Lucykate pulls out the pliers for squeezing juice out of stubborn lemons and limes.\n\nPutty knife. Tara Allison treats a metal-bladed putty knife like a spatula for lifting seared foods off cast iron, as well as for cleaning cookie sheets and cutting boards. SeriousFrivolity (carefully) scrapes a glass cooktop with one, and SorryIAsked says it\u2019s great as a spatula and serving utensil for baked goods cut into squares.\n\nSingle-edged razor blades. \u201cIdeal for scallions or ginger or anything else where you want really fine slicing,\u201d says Kenneth Pidcock. \u201cGreat for scoring fish, removing labels, opening blister packs,\u201d adds Craig D\u2019Ooge. I\u2019ll chime in that they\u2019re also helpful for scoring bread dough.\n\nDental floss. Unwaxed is best for culinary uses. Duck breath likes it for making clean cuts in dough that needs to be divided (such as a log of cinnamon roll dough). Or try it for cutting thin cake layers, as SeriousFrivolity does. Kwildhorse trusses poultry with it.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nFive cheap kitchen tools that make cooking and cleaning way easier\n\n6 reader suggestions for cheap kitchen tool tricks we wish we\u2019d thought of\n\nSix cheap tools to keep your kitchen sparkling clean", "description": "You all are a clever bunch.", "authors": ["Becky Krystal", "Reporter Covering Topics Related To Food", "September At Am", "Becky Krystal Is A Food Reporter", "The Lead Writer For Voraciously.
