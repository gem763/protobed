While the rioters identified themselves as members of unspecified indigenous groups, the Ecuadorian government revealed evidence that Maduro and former socialist Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa were paying foreigners to enter the country and commit acts of violence in its major cities.\n\nAt least seven Latin American countries issued statements in support of Moreno and condemning Maduro for encouraging violence in the wake of the riots. The riots died down when Moreno agreed to keep the gas subsidy in place for now. He has since been focusing on building closer ties to leftist groups and workers\u2019 unions that he hopes will prevent future uproars.\n\nMoreno was responding directly to remarks by Maduro henchman and U.S.-sanctioned drug lord Diosdado Cabello celebrating the riots when he referred to Maduro as an \u201cass.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not shocked by Cabello\u2019s joy, the joy of that ass governing Venezuela, Correa\u2019s joy, it is definitely because they have their hands stuck in here,\u201d Moreno reportedly said in remarks published by the broadcaster Ecuavisa. \u201cI have no doubt, under any circumstance, that for aggression, for hiring organized crime gangs asked to beat [people], to assault, to burn Quito, there was foreign money involved.\u201d\n\nCabello, the head of Maduro\u2019s socialist party and a TV show host, called the riots in Ecuador part of a \u201cBolivarian hurricane\u201d that would soon sweep Latin America. The protests in Chile \u2014 nominally about proposed subway hikes but rapidly descending into deadly looting and arson \u2014 were also on Cabello\u2019s list of \u201churricane winds,\u201d as was the return of socialist Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner to Argentine politics and the political crisis in Peru.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening in Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Argentina, Honduras is just a little breeze, and what is coming is a Bolivarian hurricane,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not isolated from the world \u2014 on the contrary, Venezuela every day is more consolidated.\u201d\n\nMaduro made similar comments celebrating riots in Chile and Ecuador on Sunday, mocking those who blamed the \u201cSao Paulo Forum\u201d \u2014 a coalition of far-left leaders organized by Cuba in Latin America \u2014 for conspiring to destabilize the region.\n\n\u201cI am happy when I see the people wake up,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cTo the Sao Paulo Forum, the plan is going in full development, victorious. All the goals that we proposed in the Forum we are achieving one by one.\u201d\n\nMaduro went on to call Moreno \u201cstupid\u201d twice and accuse \u201csavage capitalism\u201d of being behind the riots.\n\n\u201cThey blame me and all of Venezuela. The people of Ecuador rose up against the IMF and stupid Len\u00edn Moreno says I sent 200 men over there,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cIt is offensive to the indigenous movement, it\u2019s an offense to the people of Ecuador from stupid Len\u00edn Moreno.\u201d\n\nMoreno, on Monday, also used the meeting with the workers\u2019 group to note that the protests were triggered by the presidency being open about the terms of the loan from the IMF. Correa, a hard leftist who rejected money from the West, preferred to cut deals with the Chinese Communist Party that investigators once described as \u201cthe greatest heist in history.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore, when they cut deals with the Chinese, nobody knew the terms,\u201d Moreno argued. \u201cNow everything is transparent because one of the goals is \u2026 to achieve transparency, justice, and the optimization of resources.\u201d\n\nCorrea lives as a fugitive in Belgium, wanted for arrest over the abduction of a political dissident. Moreno\u2019s government has also found extensive evidence of corruption indicating that Correa signed several lucrative infrastructure and oil deals with China that impoverished the country.\n\nMaduro and Correa are close allies; Maduro appeared as a guest on Correa\u2019s Russia Today (RT) television show last month.\n\nEcuador\u2019s Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner provided journalists with evidence this month that foreigners tied to Maduro were offering up to $50 to individuals to enter Ecuador and begin rioting in its cities. He noted that a \u201csignificant number of foreign citizens\u201d were arrested burning items in the streets during \u201cprotests.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must emphasize the fact that in the demonstrations, we have arrested a significant number of infiltrating foreign citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cForeign citizens who in their testimonies have admitted to receiving money between $40 and $50 for attending these demonstrations.\u201d\n\nColombia, Brazil, Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Peru issued a joint statement condemning Venezuela for its role in the Ecuador riots this month, reading in part: \u201cWe \u2026 reject all actions intended to destabilize our democracies on the part of the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro regime and those who seek to extend the influence of his nefarious government project to the democratic countries of the region.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Ecuadorian President Len\u00edn Moreno called Venezuelan dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro an \"ass\" in remarks Monday after Maduro called him an \"idiot.\"", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Nicolas-Maduro-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
