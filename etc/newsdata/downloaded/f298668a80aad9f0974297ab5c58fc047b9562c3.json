We\u2019ve already looked at what\u2019s new with the entry-level iPhone 11, but we have something slightly different for you today: a video breaking down the differences between the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max. (Spoiler: it\u2019s not a whole lot).\n\nSo, slap your eyeballs on our delightful moving pictures above to get all the information you need about what separates the iPhone 11 Pro from the iPhone 11 Pro Max.\n\nBut\u2026 let\u2019s say you don\u2019t really want to watch a video? Well, because we\u2019re nice, we\u2019ve also included some words about the differences between the two devices below. Ugh, it\u2019s hard being this good.\n\nThe screen size\n\nThis is the most obvious one. The iPhone 11 Pro has a 5.8\u2033 screen, while the iPhone 11 Pro Max has a 6.5\u2033 display.\n\nIn regards to resolution, pixel density, and brightness, both devices have identical specs. So here, it\u2019s only really about how big you like your screen. And how large your hands are, I guess.\n\nThe weight\n\nYes, as you\u2019d expect from a phone with a bigger screen (and therefore a bigger body), the iPhone 11 Pro Max also weighs more than its counterpart.\n\nThe regular iPhone 11 Pro clocks in at 188g, while the Max version tips the scales at 226g. Both pretty heavy for phones, but they do feel weighty in a very premium, pleasurable way.\n\nBattery life\n\nWith the iPhone 11 Pro Max being bigger, Apple had more space to shove a larger battery in there. And it\u2019s pretty fantastic.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro Max can deliver almost 12 hours of continual use, compared to around ten and a half hours for the normal Pro. In terms of how long that\u2019ll last you in the real world, it gets close to two full days, compared to about a day and a half for the iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nPricing\n\nUnsurprisingly, the phones have different prices. The iPhone 11 Pro begins at $999.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the iPhone 11 Pro Max base model starts at $1,099.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s all!\n\nAside from those points, the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max are identical. They have the same processors, RAM, speakers, and storage options.\n\nSo, there you have it! A quick breakdown on what separates the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max.
