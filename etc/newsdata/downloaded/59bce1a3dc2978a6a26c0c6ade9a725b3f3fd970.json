Trump aides grapple with legal morass", "language": "en", "text": "As the Democrats\u2019 inquiry looks deeper into the actions of staff at the Office of Management and Budget, the White House chief of staff\u2019s office and the NSC, the need for legal representation also is expected to swell. And Trump allies and attorneys have not moved yet to establish a legal defense fund for Trump aides as they did during the Mueller investigation.\n\n\u201cMid-level White House staffers are worried about getting wrapped up in the Democrats\u2019 investigation even if they are not primary players,\u201d said a former senior administration official who remains in touch with ex-colleagues. \u201cPeople are concerned they will have to testify, so they are trying to lay low. If they do think they need a lawyer, they are trying to figure out how to get one.\u201d\n\nAlready on Tuesday, a NSC staffer responsible for Ukraine policy, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, testified on Capitol Hill that Trump\u2019s overtures toward the Ukraine president undermined national security. A second national security staffer, Timothy Morrison, is scheduled to speak with lawmakers on Thursday \u2014 making it two appearances from current White House officials in a single week. Democrats are also considering calling to testify Robert Blair, a top national security aide who works inside the acting chief of staff\u2019s office, according to an official working on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nFormer National Security Adviser John Bolton and his former deputy, Charles Kupperman, have retained the services of Charles Cooper, a high-powered Washington lawyer and constitutional expert, to guide them through entreaties from the Hill.\n\nThe 23-month Mueller investigation swept up more than a dozen White House aides. Special counsel Robert Mueller interviewed high-profile Trump officials like former White House counsel Don McGahn, former chief of staff Reince Priebus and former communications director Hope Hicks. The probe\u2019s investigators also interviewed or sought testimony from lesser-known staffers like Dan Scavino, Trump\u2019s social media guru in the White House; Jared Kushner\u2019s right-hand man, Avi Berkowitz; and Annie Donaldson, deputy counsel to the president.\n\nA few top Trump aides had purchased legal liability insurance in advance of entering the White House, which helped reduce their legal bills. Others were stuck with tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, a literal price paid for working for the Trump administration.\n\nDuring the Mueller investigation, top White House ethics attorney Stefan Passantino, Jones Day partner Ben Ginsberg and another lawyer at Wiley Rein helped set up a fund called the Patriot Legal Defense Fund. It helped cover legal expenses of White House and campaign aides interviewed as part of the Mueller investigation, or as part of probes done by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. Aides including Berkowitz, Scavino and senior adviser Stephen Miller all received help from the fund, according to financial disclosure information obtained by the non-profit, CREW \u2014 with much of the fund\u2019s money reportedly coming from prominent Trump donors.\n\nThe Republican National Committee also paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to law firms representing the president, the president\u2019s son and former Trump campaign aides like Hicks and Corey Lewandowski as part of the Mueller probe.\n\nNot everyone within the White House or Trump orbit followed the same protocol to receive help with legal costs or got the same deal. There was no single process for everyone to defray costs, said two people familiar with the White House\u2019s legal strategy.\n\nSo far, no one inside the White House or Republican National Committee has signaled to current White House staff that the Trump orbit will help to cover any legal bills associated with the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry \u2014 even as Democrats eye more and more testimony from White House officials and the president\u2019s inner circle.\n\nOne senior administration official said it was premature to discuss a legal defense fund at this time since the Democrats\u2019 investigation seems more like a \u201cpartisan, raw political experience\u201d than an actual legal threat, the official said. A Republican close to the White House said that despite discussions of a potential fund, no one has set one up yet for the impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe lack of an impeachment-related legal defense fund worries some Trump allies, who feel like White House staffers need cover as they attempt to protect the president or speak publicly on his behalf.\n\nBut current White House officials are skittish about discussing legal representation at all, given the fact that the president feels he did nothing wrong in his conversation with the Ukrainian president.\n\nThe White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEven trying to run down a fact related to the impeachment inquiry for a reporter or other White House official can pose legal challenges, said Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary during impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.\n\n\u201cI remember having a conversation with the White House counsel\u2019s office. The lawyers said, \u2018You cannot be a fact-finder right now. Any information you need has to come through the counsel\u2019s office. Once you become a fact-finder, you will be subpoenaed to testify and you will run up a large legal bill,\u2019\u201d Lockhart said about the protocol the Clinton White House followed during their impeachment inquiry. \u201cEven on the smallest things, I would never call someone who was testifying. I would never call their lawyer.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Many of the State or NSC staffers found their lawyers through recommendations from friends, or through professional networks from former jobs. Lawyer John Bellinger, representing former Ambassador to the Ukraine Bill Taylor and former senior adviser to the secretary of state Michael McKinley, knew both men dating back to his work as the State Department\u2019s general counsel. Other aides have found attorneys through insurance company referrals when they tried to lean on legal liability insurance.\n\nThe Office of Government Ethics also does not give White House aides any guidance on the rules for hiring a lawyer, or accepting help from a legal defense fund, said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen, who has long lobbied OGE to create such rules.\n\nThe office is currently at work on guidelines but is not expected to unveil them until after 2020, Holman said.\n\nThat leaves White House aides with little guidance on accepting pro bono legal work or help from a potential legal defense fund as the Democrats\u2019 inquiry looms.\n\nHeading into an impeachment inquiry, \u201cwe won\u2019t know how much money they are spending on their legal defense fund, or where the money is coming from,\u201d Holman added. \u201cTo me, that is the biggest shortcoming. It is one real mess.\u201d\n\nAndrew Desiderio contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c5/46/5bdc1612437d9c22fc72da5e6f14/191029-robert-blair-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
