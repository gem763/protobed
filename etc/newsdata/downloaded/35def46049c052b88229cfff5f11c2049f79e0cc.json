Sources close to the issue told Reuters that officers had been searching for documents related to some Bulgarian referees.\n\n\u201cI can confirm the presence of police officers but I can\u2019t provide more details at the moment,\u201d a BFU spokeswoman said.\n\nAn earlier statement from the BFU regarding Mihaylov read: \u201cToday the Bulgarian FA president Borislav Mihaylov has resigned from his position \u2013 his letter of resignation will be presented to the members of the FA\u2019s executive committee at this Friday\u2019s meeting.\u201d\n\nMihaylov had said in the buildup to the 6-0 defeat by England that comments by Gareth Southgate and players such as Tammy Abraham about possible racist abuse in Sofia were \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cderogatory\u201d. On Tuesday morning Bulgaria\u2019s prime minister, Boyko Borissov, called for Mihaylov to resign after the racism from the stands.\n\nThe BFU statement added: \u201cIt comes after the pressure that has been generated over the past few days; a situation that is not positive for Bulgarian football or the football union itself. After so many years in the position and because of his network of international contacts, Mr Mihaylov has said he is ready to continue helping Bulgarian football to develop in any way possible.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Bulgaria goalkeeper Plamen Iliev has said home fans \u201cbehaved well\u201d during the game, suggesting that Gareth Southgate\u2019s players \u201coverreacted a bit\u201d. The Ludogorets player said he had not heard anything, echoing comments made by his manager, Krasimir Balakov.\n\n\u201cIf I am honest, I believe they [the fans] behaved well today,\u201d Iliev said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any abuse [as far as I could hear] and I think they [the England players] overreacted a bit. The public was on a good level \u2013 I didn\u2019t hear any bad language used towards their or our players.\u201d\n\nBulgaria have gone a full year now without a win and the defeat by England on Monday night was a sixth game in charge for Balakov without a victory. Bulgaria are bottom of Euro 2020 qualifying group A with three points from seven games.", "description": "Borislav Mihaylov, the president of the Bulgarian Football Union, has resigned after England\u2019s game in Sofia, which was twice halted because of persistent racial abuse from home supporters", "authors": ["Metodi Shumanov In Sofia"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06f8f49dc653576b3c2eb754e53061e99006a97c/508_118_2985_1791/master/2985.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=23870749a48a66228382bb708632fe74", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
