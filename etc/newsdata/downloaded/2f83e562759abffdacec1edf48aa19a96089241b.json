Their only two exits were blocked by fire, including a small escape hatch above a bunk bed.\n\nAmong the possible causes the NTSB is considering: Did lithium-ion batteries, used to power the passengers' underwater cameras, malfunction during charging and overheat?\n\n\"It surprised me how small it was, it surprised me how difficult it was to access,\" said NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy.\n\nOfficials said it's believed all 34 people were killed. On Wednesday, they said the bodies of 33 of the victims had been recovered.\n\nMan who lost 5 family members in California boat fire: \"You don't want to believe it\"\n\nIn lengthy interviews with NTSB investigators, the surviving crew members described harrowing moments after the fire started.\n\n\n\n\"They tried to enter through the double doors and couldn't get in because of the flames. They tried to access the galley from the front, through the windows, but the windows wouldn't open and at some point, because of heat and smoke and fire, they had jumped from the boat,\" said Homendy.\n\nThe effort to raise the boat is being hampered by strong wings that are forecast over the next few days. One of the six crew members was supposed to have served as a night watchman. The NTSB is investigating to determine who that was and if they were on duty.", "description": "In interviews with NTSB investigators, surviving crew members described the harrowing moments after the fire started", "authors": ["Kris Van Cleave"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/02/89d4affc-8b8e-49a9-a0d7-f6c5270bfd9b/thumbnail/1200x630/91214808e3ea8619036baf726e8ea146/california-boat-fire-eddwb-qvuaiq3ld.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
