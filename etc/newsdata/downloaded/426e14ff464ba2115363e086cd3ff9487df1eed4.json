Among China\u2019s total exports of US$2.3 trillion in 2017, shipments bound for the United States accounted for 19 per cent, suggesting that they played only a marginal role in supporting Chinese economic growth. Wei Jianguo, a former vice-minister at the Ministry of Commerce responsible for foreign trade, even suggested in late 2018 that Africa could replace the US to become China\u2019s top export market by 2023.\n\nBut after 16 months of tit-for-tat trade tariffs, it is increasingly clear that the impact of the trade war has grown well beyond the question of whether African clients will buy as many Chinese goods as American consumers. At stake now is China\u2019s role in global value chains, its unfettered access to global markets and the prospects for the country\u2019s massive export apparatus that directly and indirectly employs 180 million people.\n\nThe trade war has accelerated changes in China\u2019s traditional manufacturing and export industries that were already under way, with the nation gradually shedding its low value-added, labour intensive industries in favour of high value-added, hi-tech sectors highlighted in the controversial \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d industrial policy blueprint. This is seen by the Chinese government as the key transition in the country\u2019s economic future.\n\nAround 200,000 potential buyers will still visit 60,767 exhibition booths in Guangzhou during the three week Canton Fair.

Some do not even sell directly to American buyers, but Trump\u2019s tariffs came on top of a series of fundamental changes that may alter China\u2019s role as the world\u2019s prime producer of a wide range of goods.\n\nIt\u2019s no longer the friendly trading atmosphere that it used to be in past decades. A lot of things are happening, and it\u2019s not hard for ordinary enterprises and people to feel the worsening atmosphere\n\nTom Yang\n\nWhile the hollowing out of manufacturing in the world\u2019s second biggest economy started long before Trump won the US presidency due to rising labour costs and intrusive state interventions, the tariffs and an open request from the American president for US businesses to pull out of the country have exacerbated fears that China\u2019s role as the industrial production base for global customers has started to decline rapidly.\n\nThe growth of China\u2019s textile industry, for example, has been falling steadily since the global financial crisis in 2009 and it dropped to almost zero last year, while revenue and profit created by the average textile worker started to decline in 2017, according to a sector report written by Zhu Qibin, the chief macroeconomist from the Bank of China International.\n\n\u201cFrom the perspective of industrial development, the outflow of labour-intensive industries with low added value is an inevitable trend. It can either shift to the consumer end or the raw material end,\u201d Zhu said.", "description": "When US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on the first batch of imports from China in June 2018, a move which led to the start of the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies, Chinese researchers put on a brave face, arguing that the levies would only have a marginal impact on exports", "authors": ["He Huifeng"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TjTaL1m64OYFjKIBV0LW8g--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_621/241a4ea9595bc5f92871890f320b3627", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
