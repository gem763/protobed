Everyone at home could hear referee Nigel Owens explaining certain calls.\n\nBy comparison, VAR left me puzzled at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. I'm still lost as to why they got involved to award Crystal Palace a penalty against Arsenal when, in my opinion, Wilfried Zaha clearly dived.\n\nReferee Martin Atkinson was right to book the Palace man for simulation. He was in a perfect position to make the call, too. Calum Chambers' leg was planted and Zaha threw himself to the ground. Atkinson spotted his ploy and produced a yellow card.\n\nWilfried Zaha looks bemused after initially being booked for diving at the Emirates Stadium\n\nCalum Chambers had planted his foot long before Zaha decided to throw himself over the top\n\nThen VAR got involved. They told their man on the ground to overturn his original decision and award a spot-kick instead. It was a gift for Palace.\n\nThen in the last 10 minutes, Sokratis scored to make it 3-2, only for VAR to chalk it off. Meanwhile, those at home and inside the stadium were left trying to work out why.\n\nAustralian Jarred Gillett was the video official at Stockley Park and I would love to have heard his reasoning.\n\nVAR awarded three penalties on Sunday, with Manchester United receiving two. On Saturday, Brighton became the first club to have one awarded this season that was not originally given by the referee.\n\nThis suggests the system is going to be used differently from now on. Maybe Mike Riley, the head of the PGMOL, is feeling under pressure.", "description": "MARK CLATTENBURG MY VERDICT: Watching England in the Rugby World Cup semi-final, I did not agree with the decisions of TMO but at least I understood them.", "authors": ["Mark Clattenburg For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/21/20255664-0-image-a-47_1572210637632.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
