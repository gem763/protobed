In recent days, federal prosecutors probing the financier\u2019s sex-trafficking ring have been asking Epstein victims if they could serve as witnesses in the criminal case they are building.\n\nRepresentatives from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York traveled to Florida for an Oct. 15 meeting with several of Epstein\u2019s victims and their counsel. The staffers, who worked in the victim services unit, held a similar meeting in New York on Oct. 23, lawyers for the women and a law enforcement source told The Daily Beast.\n\nTwo people familiar with the investigation said that prosecutors have heard from \u201cdozens\u201d of witnesses or victims since Epstein\u2019s arrest in July.\n\nFollowing Epstein\u2019s death in August, which was ruled a suicide by hanging, the Department of Justice said that it would continue to investigate anyone who helped Epstein procure underage girls or helped him to cover up crimes. A spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment on where the probe stands, only saying that the \u201cinvestigation is continuing.\u201d\n\nSpencer Kuvin, a Palm Beach attorney who represents two women who were abused by Epstein, said the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York offered counseling services to the group of victims who gathered in Miramar, Florida.\n\nThe representatives also worked to debunk conspiracy theories, which the victims have encountered online, related to Epstein\u2019s jailhouse suicide. According to Kuvin, prosecutors continue to battle wild speculation on how the 66-year-old money-manager died, along with rumors that he isn\u2019t dead at all.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office wanted to put to rest some of those conspiracy theories\u2014that he was killed, that he\u2019s still alive. There are people still talking about that,\u201d Kuvin told The Daily Beast. \u201cThere are still people that think this was an absolute ruse and he\u2019s sitting pretty in another part of the world.\u201d\n\nKuvin said investigators assured the women that their probe into Epstein\u2019s alleged co-conspirators was ongoing. The lawyer declined to comment on the identities of those suspected accomplices.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to meet with some of the victims to discuss whether or not they could be potential witnesses in that ongoing investigation,\u201d Kuvin said. \u201cOne of my clients is going to meet with them privately about that issue.\u201d\n\nDuring the Florida meeting, coordinators for federal prosecutors answered questions from the women, some of whom felt burned over their treatment 12 years ago, when the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Miami secretly negotiated a cushy plea deal for Epstein. Back then, the feds promised the women they\u2019d prosecute the creepy multimillionaire; instead, they collaborated with his legal team to downgrade the charges.\n\n\u201cThe focus really is: What are you doing now and are you honestly going to pursue the co-conspirators or are those just words?\u201d Kuvin said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been wronged by the system numerous times,\u201d Kuvin added of his clients and other victims of Epstein, \u201cfrom the late 2000s all the way up to him killing himself. Every time an official comes forward and says, \u2018Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re going to do the right thing,\u2019 they shake their heads and say, \u2018We\u2019ll see.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn New York last week, prosecutors met with victims at a federal building downtown where local FBI headquarters is housed to inform the women of their rights and offer counseling services.\n\nDuncan Levin, a former assistant U.S. Attorney and chief of asset forfeiture at the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office, said Epstein\u2019s inner circle shouldn\u2019t rest easy.\n\n\u201cThere is at least some evidence that other people facilitated his crimes, and there\u2019s obviously enough public interest in the case that [prosecutors] aren\u2019t going to drop it just because he\u2019s dead,\u201d said Levin, managing partner at Tucker Levin, PLLC.\n\nLevin said prosecutors are likely to thoroughly investigate Epstein\u2019s alleged enablers and seek forfeiture of Epstein\u2019s properties that were used to facilitate the sex crimes.\n\nA bare-bones rundown of Epstein\u2019s assets submitted by his lawyers following his arrest, and bank records obtained by prosecutors, provided a glimpse into Epstein\u2019s net worth which is estimated at more than $550 million, but it may not be a complete accounting. The listed assets included $56 million in cash and another $500 million in properties and investments.\n\nThe properties include $85 million worth of real estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands\u2014including his own private island\u2014an $8.6 million Paris apartment, a $12 million Palm Beach estate, a $17 million New Mexico ranch, and his Manhattan mansion\u2014which Epstein claimed is worth $55 million but prosecutors have said is worth $77 million.\n\n\u201cJustice is a slow-moving train,\u201d Levin said. \u201cThis is par for the course. Investigations are measured in months and years not days and weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would be very nervous if I were somebody who helped Jeffrey Epstein at this point and would be seeking legal counsel,\u201d Levin added.\n\nEpstein was arrested on July 6 and charged with sex-trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex-trafficking. The indictment referred to three victims and three unnamed employees of Epstein who allegedly assisted in the sex pyramid scheme.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Epstein created a \u201cnetwork of minor victims in multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit\u201d and \u201cworked and conspired with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with Epstein.\u201d\n\nFrom 2002 to 2005, the indictment states, Epstein \u201centiced and recruited\u201d minor girls as young as 14 to visit his mansions and engage in sex acts with him, after which he or his assistants gave the victims hundreds of dollars in cash.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear which alleged co-conspirators prosecutors are targeting.\n\nIn one July court filing, prosecutors requested a protective order, indicating they planned to produce certain documents and materials that \u201cwould impede, if prematurely disclosed, the Government\u2019s ongoing investigation of uncharged individuals.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, when Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges, his non-prosecution agreement with the feds granted immunity to his alleged accomplices, \u201cincluding but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or Nadia Marcinkova.\u201d\n\nGroff\u2019s lawyer, Michael Bachner, previously told The Daily Beast: \u201cAt no time during Lesley\u2019s employment with Epstein did she ever engage in any misconduct.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for Marcinkova told CNN last month that she was a victim herself and \u201cis and has been severely traumatized.\u201d They added: \u201cShe needs time to process and make sense of what she has been through before she is able to speak out.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, Kellen\u2019s spokeswoman had a similar explanation. \u201c Very soon after Sarah was brought into Epstein's world, he began to sexually abuse her, and this abuse went on for years. Sarah continues to struggle with the trauma of her experiences and has chosen not to speak publicly at this time.\u201d\n\nRoss hasn\u2019t spoken publicly on the allegations.\n\nOne lawsuit, filed by a Jane Doe in September against Epstein\u2019s estate, describes Kellen and Groff as a pair of adult employees who \u201cspecifically facilitated his abuse.\u201d The women scheduled the girl\u2019s visits to Epstein\u2019s Manhattan mansion and \u201coften asked Doe to bring other girls with her,\u201d paying her every time she did so.\n\nMeanwhile, Groff, a former assistant to Epstein, is facing a lawsuit from Jennifer Araoz, who says she was in high school when Epstein raped and abused her. A second assistant, Cimberly Espinosa, is also listed as a defendant in the case.\n\nAraoz\u2019s complaint also targets Epstein\u2019s alleged madam, Ghislaine Maxwell\u2014who\u2019s kept a low profile since the hedge-funder\u2019s arrest and has long faced accusations of recruiting underage girls and taking part in sexual abuse herself.\n\nAnother lawsuit, recently filed by Priscilla Doe, alleges that \u201cin addition to providing sexual instruction, Ghislaine Maxwell further made sure that Plaintiff and the other young females were constantly on call to sexually service Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d\n\nMaxwell isn\u2019t the only Epstein friend under scrutiny in the press. Authorities in France are looking into sexual misconduct claims against talent scout Jean-Luc Brunel, accused in civil court filings of procuring young models for Epstein to exploit.\n\n\u201cJeffrey Epstein has told me that he has slept with over 1,000 of Brunel\u2019s girls, and everything that I have seen confirms this claim,\u201d said accuser Virginia Giuffre in a 2015 affidavit. Giuffre says she was 16 when Maxwell recruited her into Epstein\u2019s trafficking ring.\n\nIn response, Brunel issued a statement denying Giuffre\u2019s claims, saying he never participated \u201cdirectly nor indirectly, in the actions Mr. Jeffrey Epstein is being accused of.\u201d\n\nLast year, Epstein may have attempted to buy the silence of alleged co-conspirators just as his name re-emerged in the press.\n\nProsecutors say Epstein wired payments to two unnamed women\u2014one received $250,000 while the other got $100,000\u2014shortly after the Miami Herald\u2019s expos\u00e9 on Epstein\u2019s 2007 sweetheart deal. Those individuals were listed as possible co-conspirators in Epstein\u2019s non-prosecution agreement, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said in July.\n\nAt a bail hearing that month, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex Rossmiller told the court that \u201cafter seven days of this case being public following months of a covert investigation, the evidence is already significantly stronger and getting stronger every single day.\n\n\u201cMany individuals identifying themselves as victims and witnesses have contacted the government,\u201d Rossmiller continued, \u201cand we are in the process of receiving and corroborating this additional evidence.\u201d\n\nBrad Edwards, an attorney who sued the government on behalf of victims over Epstein\u2019s lenient plea deal, said, \u201cI assume that if there are others that should be held accountable for crimes that can still be prosecuted, then they will.\u201d\n\nEdwards said he trusts that New York prosecutors \u201care trying to leave no stone unturned.\u201d\n\nLast month, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra refused to scrap the non-prosecution agreement that shielded Epstein and his alleged co-conspirators from facing serious charges\u2014despite Marra\u2019s ruling that the agreement was illegal.\n\nMarra also denied the victims\u2019 requests for other relief: attorneys\u2019 fees, a hearing where victims could speak, and the release of documents including grand jury materials. The decision was part of a 2008 lawsuit Jane Does 1 and 2 filed against the United States, alleging the feds violated the Crime Victims\u2019 Right Act.\n\nCourtney Wild, who has come forward as Jane Doe 1, has appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. Oral arguments are scheduled for January.\n\n\u201cA ruling rescinding the immunity provisions would have permitted the victims to confer with government prosecutors about the possibility of obtaining prosecution of Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida \u2014 i.e., would have afforded them their rights under the CVRA,\u201d Wild\u2019s appeal states.", "description": "Numerous Epstein victims have met with prosecutors in recent days.", "authors": ["Kate Briquelet", "Pervaiz Shallwani", "Senior Reporter", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572276616/191028-briquelet-epstein-tease_vad4ec", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
