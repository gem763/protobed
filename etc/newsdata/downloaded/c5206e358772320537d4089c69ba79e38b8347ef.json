Picture taken August 29, 2014. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nNBC News fired Lauer two years ago after a female colleague accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, making him one of a series of rich and powerful men to be felled by accusations of harassment or misconduct.\n\nIn Farrow\u2019s book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d the same former NBC employee who leveled the accusations that led to Lauer\u2019s dismissal says he forced her to have anal sex after a night of drinking in the Russian city that hosted the 2014 Summer Games, Variety reported, citing the book.\n\n\u201cIt was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,\u201d the woman told Farrow, the report said. \u201cIt was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u201d\n\nReuters was unable to obtain a copy of the book, which publisher Little, Brown and Co is due to release on Oct. 15.\n\nVariety later on Wednesday published a letter from Lauer provided by his lawyer denying the allegations described in Farrow\u2019s book as well as other accusations of misconduct that have been leveled against him over the past two years.\n\n\u201cToday, nearly two years after I was fired by NBC, old stories are being recycled, titillating details are being added, and a dangerous and defamatory new allegation is being made,\u201d Lauer wrote. \u201cAll are being spread as part of a promotional effort to sell a book.\u201d\n\nEfforts by Reuters to reach representatives of Lauer, Farrow and Little, Brown and Co were not immediately successful.\n\nIn statement on Wednesday, NBC said: \u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint.\u201d\n\n\u201cCatch and Kill\u201d focuses on Farrow\u2019s investigation into allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior by movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who was arrested last year in New York on rape and other charges.\n\nThis week, \u201cThe New Yorker\u201d magazine published a three-part series of excerpts from Farrow\u2019s upcoming book. The passages did not contain any reference to the allegations against Lauer.", "description": "Matt Lauer, the once-popular co-host of NBC's \"Today,\" is accused in a new book by journalist Ronan Farrow of raping a female colleague at a hotel room during the 2014 Sochi Olympics, according to a report in Variety on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439051534&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9820R", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
