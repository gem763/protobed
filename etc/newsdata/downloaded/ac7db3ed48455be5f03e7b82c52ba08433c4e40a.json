Dickstein said she thought of the beautiful brick campus of Haddonfield Memorial High and had her location picked.\n\n\"To me it just made sense to have it there because in every other culture the whole village attends the wedding ceremony and the celebration,\" she said. \"What better way to embrace that than to bring my wedding to my village?\"\n\nTessa Marie Images\n\nDickstein worked closely with school administrators to plan her wedding ceremony, the first to ever be held at the high school.\n\nOn her wedding day, Sept. 28, the high school's crew team set out the rented chairs, other students organized and handed out the wedding programs and students' parents helped decorate with flowers.\n\n\"At one point I looked over and the German teacher, some parents, our crew team and our a cappella group were all holding up my chuppa,\" Dickstein recalled. \"I will never forget that.\"\n\nTessa Marie Images\n\nTwo of Dickstein's teaching mentors delivered readings at the wedding and the school's a cappella group provided the music.\n\nDickstein held her wedding reception at a different location in Philadelphia, but had an ice cream truck come to the school after the wedding for students to enjoy.\n\n\"She was able to merge her two worlds in a way that sums up who she is,\" Tammy McHale, Haddonfield Memorial High School's principal, said of Dickstein. \"She is so involved and not just in the classroom.\"\n\nTessa Marie Images\n\nDickstein and her husband even took their honeymoon over the summer, before their wedding, because that was the time she had off from school.\n\nCheck out this video of @DrLRepollet surprising @MsDickstein with the news that she is New Jersey's newest State Teacher of the Year! @HaddonfieldHS @HaddonSchools pic.twitter.com/WEhOgNM4dd \u2014 New Jersey Department of Education (@NewJerseyDOE) October 2, 2019\n\nEven with her commitment to her students, Dickstein said she had no idea she would win Teacher of the Year honors, saying she \"really didn't think it was going to happen to me.\"\n\nLooking back, she thinks what makes her stand out as a teacher is that she teaches her students \"how to activate their own ideas.\"\n\nTessa Marie Images\n\n\"When I feel like something needs to be done and it's the right thing I'm going to do it,\" she said. \"I think my commitment to service translates to my students and my students in turn are committed to what's important to them.\"\n\nReflecting on why she loves being a teacher, Dickstein added, \"I have always felt the calling to be a public servant and to do right by my country and my community in my best way and I can do that every day as a teacher.\"", "description": "New Jersey teacher of the year Kimberly Dickstein taught for 12 years at Haddonfield Memorial High School and got married at the high school.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/wedding-teacher-ht-ml-191004_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
