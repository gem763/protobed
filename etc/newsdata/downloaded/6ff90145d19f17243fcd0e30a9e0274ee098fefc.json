They see firsthand how droughts, changes in water use impact people and endangered species.\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 El agua es la vida. Water is life.\n\nDoris Rhodes knows that mantra well. She inherited a riverside property from her father about an hour south of the city more than a decade ago. The land, in arid Socorro County, is nestled against the Rio Grande. Sprawling along 629 acres on the east side of the river, where there are no levees, it is one of the few wetlands in the area.\n\nAt first, Rhodes had no idea what to do with her inheritance. The land was covered with invasive plant species that sucked up water and choked out wildlife. She considered selling it, but one early April morning changed her mind.\n\n\u201cIt had rained, and there was now a lake on the north end of the property,\u201d Rhodes says. \u201cThe geese were coming in. I looked at those geese and at that water and said to myself, \u2018Lakes don\u2019t just pop up out of nowhere in New Mexico. You can\u2019t sell this land.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat was in 2006. Ever since, Rhodes has used her riverside property as a refuge for endangered plants and animals; she has helped restore river habitat for the southwestern willow flycatcher, the Rio Grande silvery minnow, the yellow-billed cuckoo and the Pecos sunflower.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rewarding to carve out a natural space on the Rio Grande where all species can thrive,\u201d she says.\n\nWater use impacts every walk of life\n\nWater in the West \u2014 especially in arid New Mexico \u2014 is scarce. The Rio Grande begins in Colorado and flows 1,900 miles before reaching the Gulf of Mexico. It is a critical source of water for the vast deserts of the state.\n\nPeople here know where their water comes from. They pay attention to the water levels of the Rio Grande, which is often called a \u201cfeast or famine\u201d river. Years with lots of snow and runoff mean the water will run fast and high for most of the summer. But in other years, parts of the river will slow to a trickle. Last year during a historic drought, stretches of the Rio Grande went dry as early as April, which is nearly unprecedented.\n\nMore from Report for America: My print-only local newspaper won't chase Twitter likes, Google searches \u2014 just the story\n\nThat makes water valuable, which means everyone has an opinion on how best to use it.\n\nI cover water and environmental issues for the Albuquerque Journal. Nearly every water-related meeting I\u2019ve attended as a reporter has drawn people from all walks of life.\n\nPoliticians in their carefully pressed suits sit next to farmers and ranchers in wide-brimmed hats, who sit next to tribal leaders representing the oldest water rights holders in the nation.\n\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists search for endangered Rio Grande silvery minnows in isolated pools in the riverbed near Socorro, New Mexico, in 2013. (Photo: Susan Montoya Bryan/AP)\n\nI\u2019ve been reminded several times \u2014 even by Rhodes herself \u2014 that the Rio Grande means different things to different people.\n\nTo farmers and ranchers, it\u2019s how they make a living. Their crops and livestock depend on that lifeblood flowing through New Mexico.\n\nTo residents of the state\u2019s 19 pueblos, the river is a sacred resource that has supported their people for hundreds (if not thousands) of years.\n\nTo politicians, the river is a measuring stick for how they are responding to increasing water demand amidst a global climate crisis.\n\nTo conservationists like Rhodes, the river is a refuge for threatened plants and animals.\n\nThey all care about the Rio Grande. Their different water interests aren\u2019t always at odds. The lines blur, which is what makes water issues in this county \u2014 and state \u2014 so complex.\n\nRestoring the natural world\n\nI visited Rhodes in Socorro County to learn about her conservation work. We bounced around the dirt roads on her land in a pickup next to the muddy river while she talked about her love for the Rio Grande.\n\nRhodes feels like she has been given stewardship over this stretch of the river. She protects the water and the wildlife that call the river home.\n\nThe Rio Grande in Socorro County, New Mexico, near Doris Rhodes\u2019 property, about an hour south of Albuquerque. (Photo: Theresa Davis/GroundTruth)\n\nHistorically, the Rio Grande moved slow and flooded often. Now the river is confined with man-made dams and levees to prevent flooding. That makes it flow faster, which is not ideal for the tiny silvery minnow, an endangered species that thrives in a slow-moving river habitat.\n\nDeforestation is a worldwide problem: I've seen the Amazon rainforest fires. They're a warning from the Ghost of Climate Future.\n\nRhodes worked closely with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to create an ideal river habitat for the silvery minnow. The groups lowered the riverbank to make an area where water moves slow, which is ideal for the small fish.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re returning the river back to its natural state here,\u201d Rhodes says. \u201cNot everyone has a chance to do that.\u201d\n\nMary Carlson, a public affairs worker who worked with Rhodes, says the Bureau of Reclamation and other federal agencies in charge of preserving the Rio Grande and delivering water to the region have been dealing with water scarcity for a long time.\n\n\u201cWe work together with everyone when things are bad,\u201d Carlson says. \u201cAnd in these good water years, we try to make the most of it. It\u2019s always a roller coaster ride with the Rio Grande.\u201d\n\nWater is life. And here in New Mexico, the Rio Grande is the state\u2019s beating heart.\n\nTheresa Davis is a Report for America corps member, covering the environment for the Albuquerque Journal in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
