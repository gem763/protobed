And I\u2019m telling you, foreign nations, foreign people looking at us. They honestly think we\u2019re nuts. And then you have Presidents and saying nothing was wrong. \u2026 But Nancy Pelosi said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s what he said. Isn\u2019t it?\u2019 But she was angry as hell when she got to read the transcript. Because she said, \u2018Wait a minute, that\u2019s not what I was told.\u2019 But she was stuck, she was stuck.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn our database of President Trump\u2019s false or misleading claims, we\u2019ve documented how he twists things out of proportion or simply invents stories out of whole cloth. Sometimes he even goes through a time warp. All of these elements are present in this pair of statements, which are similar or identical to other statements he made over the weekend at various events or media availabilities.\n\nCentral to the president\u2019s message is a Four-Pinocchio claim \u2013 that the whistleblower complaint inaccurately portrayed his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the events surrounding it. But we\u2019ve documented that most of the whistleblower\u2019s factual allegations have turned out to be on target.\n\nAD\n\nBut the president wants his supporters to believe the complaint falsely portrayed the phone call so then he can explain why, in his words, the man leading the impeachment investigation \u201cmade up\u201d a conversation and the House speaker supposedly was upset when she saw the actual transcript. In an added twist, Trump sometimes tries to adjust the time frame to make his point appear even more dramatic.\n\nAD\n\nThe Schiff description\n\nIn a bit of a self-inflicted wound, Schiff at a congressional hearing on Sept. 26 summarized the content Trump's July 25 call, occasionally for dramatic effect (or what Schiff later called a parody) that he opined was \u201ca classic organized crime shakedown.\"\n\nAD\n\nThere is no exact transcript of the conversation -- in which Trump urged an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 election rival -- as the summary was cobbled together from notes by White House officials. So Schiff told the audience that \"this is the essence of what the president communicates\u201d and that he would describe \u201cin sum and character, what the president was trying to communicate.\u201d That was a signal to listeners he was not quoting verbatim from the rough transcription. Nevertheless, Schiff included some eyebrow-raising embellishments.\n\nAD\n\nIn particular, Schiff suggested Trump, after asking for \u201ca favor,\u201d said something along the lines of: \u201cI'm going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent.\u201d\n\nThis is where Schiff gave Trump an opening for attack. Biden\u2019s name came up twice in the call, not seven times. The president also urged a probe into the discredited conspiracy theory that a private company had a role in starting the \u201cRussian hoax\u201d because supposedly a Democratic National Committee server has been spirited to Ukraine. Trump also said three times that his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, or Attorney General William Barr would get in contact with Zelensky. So there were a number of requests -- ABC News counted eight -- but not seven about Biden.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has taken this inaccurate account by Schiff and run hard with it. (Never mind the fact that Trump routinely embellishes his \u201cfacts.\u201d) He\u2019s even declared that Schiff was guilty of a \u201ccrime\u201d and should be tried for \u201ctreason\u201d or even \u201cimpeached,\u201d even though members of Congress cannot be impeached. \u201cHe gave the most horrible rendition, adding his own words....He took my really -- believe it or not -- congenial and gentle words, and he made me sound like a tyrant,\u201d Trump said on Oct. 5.\n\nAD\n\nBut apparently even this spin was not good enough for the president. In recent days, he has added a new wrinkle: That Schiff gave his description of the call before Trump released the transcript, thereby providing a gotcha moment for his fans.\n\n\u201cHe made a conversation that didn\u2019t exist. He never thought in a million years that I was going to release the real conversation. And when it did, the whistleblower turned out to be totally inaccurate.\u201d (Oct. 12, Fox Interview)\n\n\u201cThis crooked Adam Schiff made a statement -- long, beautiful statement -- and it was a fraud. He repeated my call, but it wasn\u2019t me. He made it so bad\u2026But then I did something that they didn\u2019t expect. I immediately called up Ukraine, through my representatives \u2026 I got approval to immediately make that call public\u2026. By the way, he only did it because he never thought that I was going to release the transcript\u2026 He did it and then I released the transcript. They never thought in a million years -- even in terms of violation with another country, but we got approval.\" (Oct. 12, Value Voters Summit)\n\n\"When Schiff goes out and speaks before Congress, they never thought I was going to release the transcript of my call.\u201d (Oct. 11, campaign rally in Lake Charles, La.)\n\n\u201cDemocrat\u2019s game was foiled when we caught Schiff fraudulently making up my Ukraine conversation, when I released the exact conversation Transcript.\u201d (Oct. 14, tweet)\n\nBut this is totally mixed up. The rough transcript \u2013which the White House acknowledged was not verbatim -- was released on Sept. 25 and Schiff held the hearing on Sept. 26. Republicans at the hearing were able to call out Schiff\u2019s embellishments precisely because they had the recorded words in front of them.\n\nAD\n\nPelosi\u2019s reaction\n\nWhile Trump has been knocking Schiff for putting words into his mouth, he has also been putting fake words in the mouth of the House Speaker Pelosi. In Trump\u2019s dramatic telling, Pelosi authorized the impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24 \u2013 only to be shocked when the rough transcript was released a day later.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey came out with a whistleblower report before they saw the conversation. Had they waited one day, Nancy Pelosi wouldn\u2019t have made a fool out of herself, and she would have been able to say what I said. Because when she saw it, she said, \u2018This is not what the whistleblower said.\u2019\u201d (Oct. 7, remarks at White House)\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi said, a day before seeing the transcript of the call with the Ukrainian President, we\u2019ve got to impeach him. \u2018We\u2019ve got to impeach him, right?\u2019 And then she saw the call and she said to her people, \u2018What the hell? Nobody ever told me this was the call.\u2019 But she keeps going anyway because the press is fake and they play right into their head.\u201d (Oct. 10, Minneapolis campaign rally)\n\nNancy Pelosi said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s what he said. Isn\u2019t it?\u2019 But she was angry as hell when she got to read the transcript. Because she said, \u2018Wait a minute, that\u2019s not what I was told.\u2019 But she was stuck, she was stuck.\u201d (Oct. 11, Lake Charles, La. campaign rally)\n\n\u201cIt was a terrible, terrible fraudulent thing. And then Nancy Pelosi went on television. She was very angry when she read the actual call, because this was an exact -- I guess stenographers, they took it down. And she was very angry because she got led -- she was a day early when she started talking about impeachment.\u201d (Oct. 12, Value Voters summit)\n\nTrump offers no evidence for his supposed knowledge of Pelosi\u2019s \u201cangry as hell\u201d closed-door conversations. Drew Hammill, a Pelosi spokesman, said Trump\u2019s account is fiction.\n\nWhen the rough transcript was released, Pelosi\u2019s assessment was tough: \u201cThe release of the notes of the call by the White House confirms that the President engaged in behavior that undermines the integrity of our elections, the dignity of the office he holds and our national security. The President has tried to make lawlessness a virtue in America and now is exporting it abroad.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nWe\u2019ve gone well beyond irony at this point.\n\nTo make his case against impeachment, Trump argues that whistleblower did not get his phone call correct, when key elements of the complaint are confirmed by the rough transcript released by the White House. The rest of the whistleblower complaint checks out well too.\n\nAD\n\nThen Trump alters the timeline to make it appear as if the release of the transcript came after Schiff\u2019s dramatic reenactment, in a false effort to claim he played gotcha on the Democrats.\n\nFinally, in complaining that Schiff concocted the words used in the call, Trump conjures up an invented conversation of Pelosi with her staff. That further undercuts whatever complaint he might have about Schiff\u2019s description of the conversation with Zelensky.\n\nThe president earns Four Pinocchios, yet again.\n\nFour Pinocchios\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles\n\nAD", "description": "In recent days, the president increasingly has misled and deflected about the transcript released by the White House.", "authors": ["Glenn Kessler", "The Fact Checker"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uJjS_6TsYRFAuOzYvxqeHCaoBBs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6SSFQCHOXUI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
