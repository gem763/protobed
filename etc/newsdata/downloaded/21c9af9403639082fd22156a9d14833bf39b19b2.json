Johnson named the suspect as 42-year-old Anne Sacoolas on Monday.\n\nPolice say the suspect was driving on the wrong side of the road when she and Harry Dunn collided. Sacoolas was originally cooperating in the case, police have said, but that she left the country despite assuring them she would remain in the UK.\n\nRead More", "description": "The parents of a teenage motorcyclist who died in a road accident have appealed to US President Donald Trump to intervene, after the wife of an American diplomat suspected in the case left the country.", "authors": ["Angela Dewan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191005105431-01-harry-dunn-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
