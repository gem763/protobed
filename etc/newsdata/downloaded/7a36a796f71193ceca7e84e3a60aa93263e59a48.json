As part of the declaration, Trump shifted $3.6 billion away from military construction projects to go toward the wall.\n\nThe move infuriated both Democrats and Republicans, who publicly warned him against using his emergency powers to build the wall. GOP lawmakers, in particular, worried that it would let a future Democratic president leapfrog Congress on issues like gun control or climate change.\n\nBut the veto override had been expected to fall short after the resolution initially passed the Senate with only 54 votes, including the support of 11 Republican senators.\n\nIt's the second time Congress has failed to override Trump's veto of a resolution nixing his emergency declaration. The House tried, unsuccessfully, in March to override Trump's initial veto.\n\n\"It's up to this body to assert our constitutional authority and override that veto. Not only is it a fundamental constitutional principle at stake, the president's emergency declaration has real-life impacts, impacts to our national security and impacts to the 23 states whose projects are now gone,\" Udall said.", "description": "The Senate on Thursday failed to override President Trump's veto of a resolution that would have ended the emergency declaration\u00a0intended to help build the\u00a0border wall.\u00a0Senators", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_101119getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
