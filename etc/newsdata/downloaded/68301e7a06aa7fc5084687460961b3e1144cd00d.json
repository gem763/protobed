They would like to extend their deepest, heartfelt gratitude to all who have reached out with words of support and prayer and will continue to feel all the love as they go through this difficult time.\u201d\n\nMiguel will briefly take a break from his leading role in the Chicago production of Hamilton. However, he plans to return to the stage soon.\n\nOn Sunday, Kelly, 37, shared a black-and-white photo of her late daughter\u2019s bedroom with her stuffed animals lined up neatly on her bed in a row.\n\n\u201cThe machines are off,\u201d the grieving parent wrote. \u201cHer bed is empty. The quiet is deafening. Miss Adelaide Grace left us early Saturday morning. She went peacefully in my arms and surrounded by love. Finally, she is free from pain, reactions and seizures but leaves our hearts shattered. We love you so much Adelaide bug and forever after.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Hamilton Star Miguel Cervantes and Wife Prepare Their Goodbyes to \u2018Warrior\u2019 Daughter Adelaide\n\nAdelaide spent nearly her entire life battling seizures no one can still quite explain. Adelaide\u2019s story has been documented through the years on her mother Kelly\u2019s popular blog Inchstones and through her work with the Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy (CURE), which raises funds for research into a cure for the devastating illness.\n\nIn November 2018, Adelaide missed some traditional milestones as a baby, and when she was just 7 months old, she experienced her first seizure. Doctors would quickly determine that the seizure was a result of epilepsy. At 9 months old, Adelaide was diagnosed with Infantile Spasms (IS.)\n\n\u201cOh, she was feisty as hell,\u201d Kelly told PEOPLE just one day before her daughter\u2019s tragic death. \u201cShe is a warrior. I have never met someone stronger in my life. She shared her opinions in her own way. She came into the world and she had a mission and a story. I\u2019m so proud that no one will ever forget her story.\u201d\n\nAdelaide\u2019s older brother Jackson endlessly served as a bright energy for his sister.\n\n\u201cHe is what keeps me strong,\u201d Kelly told PEOPLE. \u201cHe runs around this house and brings an energy that we need. And he needs us. We might be going through the worst thing ever, but he is the one that gets us up when we are just fighting emotionally to get out of bed.\u201d\n\nMiguel added: \u201cI\u2019m never going to ask why these things happen and oh, I\u2019d give away all that I have to have Adelaide here. But without her condition, we would have never met the strong and amazing people we are surrounded by right now. We have been giving this platform to talk about Infantile Spasms and epilepsy. And we have been given this platform to tell people about Adelaide. And that\u2019s exactly what we intend to do.\u201d\n\nDetails for Adelaide\u2019s celebration of life will be announced soon.", "description": "Miguel Cervantes' Wife Reveals Daughter 'Died in My Arms' After Hospice Care", "authors": ["Tricia Despres"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cT9ri43_7VZ.rmp.QBnTXQ--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/ba3185b40f50596c772b115c59930bdd", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
