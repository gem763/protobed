Gorsuch who was 50 years old at the time of his nomination and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh who was 53.\n\nBoth Trump nominees were circuit court judges \u2014 just like Justice Ginsburg \u2014before being nominated.\n\nMr. Trump, though, has seen at least one lower court judicial nominee withdrawal over a lack of experience, which was showcased during his confirmation hearing.\n\nMr. Clinton acknowledged age is an issue that presidents consider when making judicial appointments, especially to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cI hate age discrimination and I hated it when I was young and now that I\u2019m not, I can say that,\u201d Mr. Clinton said. \u201cBut I did worry about it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
