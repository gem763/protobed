With the average monthly benefit at $1,404, retirees who rely on Social Security to pay for all of their living expenses are on very tight budgets. Fortunately, there are measures you can take to make your benefits stretch, and there are plenty of discounts and perks seniors can take advantage of once they do retire, allowing them to live a rich life with limited funds.\n\n1. Delay Taking Your Social Security Benefits\n\nRetiring from work and beginning to collect Social Security are two reasons to celebrate getting older. Although you are able to start collecting Social Security at age 62, your monthly benefits will be significantly higher if you wait until you reach your full retirement age, which ranges from 65 to 67 depending on the year you were born.\n\nFor example, if your full retirement age is 67, but you start collecting Social Security at 62, your benefits will be 30 percent less than they would be if you waited the additional five years. If possible, wait to start collecting until even after you reach your full retirement age. If you delay collecting Social Security until age 70, you will receive your maximum Social Security benefits.\n\n2. If You Already Filed for Social Security Early, Consider Withdrawing Your Claim\n\nDid you claim your benefits early and now find that you\u2019re shocked by the true costs of retiring on Social Security? If you filed for Social Security within the past 12 months, you can withdraw your claim and restart at a later date if you want to increase your benefits. However, it\u2019s important to note that if you choose to withdraw, you must repay all the benefits you received up to that point. Still, this could be worth it in the long term to be able to max out your Social Security payments.\n\n3. Plan Out Your Social Security Survivor Benefits\n\nIf you are married, it\u2019s important to discuss how to maximize Social Security benefits should one spouse die. When one person dies, the widow or widower can receive the deceased spouse\u2019s benefits instead of their own if the benefits are higher than what they were receiving before. So it makes sense for the higher-earning spouse to retire later so that when two Social Security checks coming to the household become only one, the surviving spouse will receive the greatest benefits possible.\n\n4. Move to an Area With a Lower Cost of Living\n\nYour Social Security benefits will stretch further when your cost of living is lower. If you live in an expensive location, consider moving to a place where you can live on only a social security check. Cities like Tuscon, Ariz. and Reno, Nev. have warm weather and plenty to do for retirees, plus their cost of living is low. And in Reno, rent is under $1,000 a month.\n\n5. Pay Off Debt Before Retiring\n\nTo make the most of your Social Security income, it\u2019s best to pay off all debts, including credit card bills and mortgages, before retiring. This way you can focus on putting your benefits towards what you need day-to-day, rather than spending it on things you purchased in the past.\n\n6. Relocate to a Tax-Friendly State\n\nMost states and Washington, D.C. do not tax Social Security benefits, but you can make your benefits stretch even further if you live in a state with even fewer taxes. Alaska and New Hampshire levy no tax on sales or income, and Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming do have sales taxes but don\u2019t impose state income taxes or taxes on pension income, according to AARP.\n\n7. Get a Roommate\n\nSplitting living expenses with a roommate or housemate is a great way to make your dollars stretch further, plus it can prevent the loneliness that often comes with being a retiree. A SmartAsset study found that in some major cities, renters who split a two-bedroom with a roommate save more than $800 a month over those who rent a one-bedroom on their own. Even if you are not renting, having a roommate can lower the amount you spend on utilities, internet, cable and energy.\n\n8. Take Advantage of Free Entertainment\n\nYou don\u2019t need to spend any of your Social Security check to stay busy and have fun. Go to a museum with free admission or check out a library book to stay entertained during the day. You can also attend open mic nights at a local coffee shop or theater, which often do not charge an admission fee. Other free activities include attending book readings, going to a lecture at a local college or university and attending free outdoor concerts.", "description": "Make the most of your golden years without spending a lot.", "authors": ["Gabrielle Olya"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bdfL95mjphvZbKgRW87cDQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/gobankingrates_644/817d001322092ecefea4fe36a33030ca", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
