Even on a damp Monday in Tokyo, the humidity is unmissable and so is the air of novelty. Judging by the 15,000 locals who queued around the block just to watch Wales train in Kitakyushu, the next few weeks are going to challenge plenty of familiar assumptions\n\nDrive \u2013 or rather crawl \u2013 through the busier business districts of the Japanese capital and images of the host nation\u2019s players are plastered across the windows of 24-7 convenience stores. There is even a 40ft high action picture of the Australia fly-half Bernard Foley, not normally a household name, on a tower block overlooking one of the main intersections. The All Blacks long-serving coach, Steve Hansen, has traversed the rugby world multiple times but even he looks faintly taken aback by the rising tide of craziness.\n\nWebb Ellis didn\u2019t even invent rugby, so why is his name on the World Cup? | Michael Aylwin Read more\n\nWith Friday\u2019s kick-off approaching, England\u2019s trump card is also becoming increasingly apparent. Having coached extensively in Japan, few individuals have a clearer idea of what awaits than Eddie Jones, who also guided the Brave Blossoms to three pool wins at the 2015 World Cup. Jones has hung around professional sport long enough to know nothing will be easy but his insider knowledge could yet prove invaluable.\n\nWith the weather forecast for the region unsettled for the next fortnight, this already has the feel of a tournament which could upset even the most carefully laid plans. If it pours down for New Zealand\u2019s game against South Africa in Yokohama this Saturday, for example, one involuntary slip of a greasy ball could reshape the entire competition. When Warren Gatland is rubbing baby oil on Wales\u2019s training balls on the eve of a World Cup and the lead singer of a Japanese death metal band is among the host nation\u2019s interpreters, anything is possible once the actual rugby starts.\n\nIn that respect the next few weeks will be right up Jones\u2019s street. Never mind that England\u2019s opening game against Tonga will be safely staged beneath a closed roof in Sapporo in the more northerly climes of Hokkaido. Jones has long been seeking people capable of adapting to any temperatures and conditions, to the point where discomfort and adaptability become second nature.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Japan players Michael Leitch (centre), Kazuki Himeno (left) and Fumiaki Tanaka portrayed on paddy fields in Gyoda, Saitama Prefecture, near Tokyo.

Every coach wants big, fit players but Jones has spent four years looking specifically for resilience, both physical and mental. From the moment he took over as England head coach he has also been fixated on one date: 2 November 2019. Way back in January 2017 he even let the Guardian into the secret of precisely what would happen in the Rugby World Cup final in Yokohama. \u201cEngland v New Zealand, with England to win by a point. It\u2019ll be a cracking game.\u201d\n\nThat sense of unwavering conviction has occasionally flickered, not least when England trailed in a dismal fifth in the 2018 Six Nations. Looking back at his unfolding masterplan with the benefit of hindsight, however, is instructive. When it comes to removing players from their comfort zones, Jones has been relentlessly consistent. All the comings and goings in selection, the ridiculously early alarm calls and the excessive backroom staff turnover now feel part of that same grand design.\n\nLove him or not, his players can now sense things starting to take real shape. When England bolt all the various key segments of their gameplan together \u2013 fitness, defence, a strong set-piece, pace out wide \u2013 as they did against Ireland in both February and August they can look devastating.\n\n\u2018Preparation is everything\u2019: the real Eddie Jones\u2019s hard road to Japan Read more\n\nMaybe, too, Jones\u2019s luck is changing. His team to face Tonga is not due to be unveiled until Friday and both Joe Cokanasiga and Mark Wilson have knee niggles but, just when he needs them, his main men should all be available. Maro Itoje, Billy Vunipola, Kyle Sinckler, Ellis Genge, Courtney Lawes, Manu Tuilagi \u2026 anyone repeatedly bumping into them can expect a very tiring, painful afternoon. Add in a fit Mako Vunipola and Cokanasiga and, pound for pound, this is the strongest England squad \u2013 in all senses \u2013 since 2003. A primed, focused Tuilagi almost feels like a new signing after so many years in the injury doldrums.\n\nHansen also knows his All Black side could have their hands full containing a full-on Springbok pack in perhaps the most heavy-duty opening weekend fixture at any Rugby World Cup in the professional era. Even the hugely experienced Kiwi lock Sam Whitelock, about to commence his third World Cup, is already sensing a different level of pressure. \u201cRegardless of the opposition in the first game, there\u2019s that knot in the stomach,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what that first one\u2019s going to be like.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\n\n\nThere is particular uncertainty about South Africa\u2019s rush defence out wide, which Hansen has described as \u201crolling the dice big time\u201d in terms of the risk/reward equation. It worked pretty well last month when the Boks held the All Blacks to a 16-16 draw in Wellington but Hansen appears keen to put an element of doubt in South African minds if he can. He also argues Saturday\u2019s winner is far from guaranteed to win the World Cup. \u201cLogic will tell you whoever wins this game, probably wins the pool. But as we found in 2011, you don\u2019t have to necessarily win the pool to get into the final. France did it the other way. It\u2019s not the end of the world if you lose \u2026 there\u2019s a lot of water to go under the bridge.\u201d Quite literally so if this week\u2019s weather forecasts prove accurate.", "description": "Japan\u2019s unfamiliar surroundings and the potential for extreme weather mean that coaches must be ready for anything in the Rugby World Cup, which starts on Friday", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f853f99b0bb6795ce64086de28ff32df2fcdc3b/0_147_5144_3087/master/5144.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=96634ed0a359ff96c6dcff7b6831b81c", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
