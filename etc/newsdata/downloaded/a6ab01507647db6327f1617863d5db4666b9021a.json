Or when they pretend their fingers are a gun.\n\nHere\u2019s a crazy example that just happened.\n\nA 12-year-old Overland Park girl formed a gun with her fingers, pointed at four of her Westridge Middle School classmates one at a time, and then turned the pretend weapon toward herself. Police hauled her out of school in handcuffs, arrested her and charged the child with a felony for threatening. \u2026according to Johnson County District Court documents, on Sept. 18, the girl \u201cunlawfully and feloniously communicated a threat to commit violence, with the intent to place another, in fear, or with the intent to cause the evacuation, lock down or disruption in regular, ongoing activities \u2026\u201d or created just the risk of causing such fear. \u2026\u201cI think that this is something that probably could have been handled in the principal\u2019s office and got completely out of hand,\u201d said Jon Cavanaugh, the girl\u2019s grandfather in California, where the girl is now living. He said his granddaughter has no access to a real gun and she had no intent of harming anyone. \u201cShe was just mouthing off,\u201d he said.\n\nSchool bureaucrats also over-react if students like a picture of a toy gun.\n\nHere\u2019s a story from two years ago.\n\nAn Edgewood Middle School student was handed a 10-day suspension for \u201cliking\u201d a picture of a gun on Instagram with the caption \u201cready.\u201d The parents of Zachary Bowlin posted a picture of the intended suspension notice which read, \u201cThe reason for the intended suspension is as follows: Liking a post on social media that indicated potential school violence.\u201d \u201cI was livid, I mean, I\u2019m sitting here thinking \u2018you just suspended him for ten days for liking a picture of a gun on a social media site,\u201d father Marty Bowlin said. \u201cHe never shared, he never commented, he never made a threatening post\u2026 anything on the site, just liked it.\u201d The picture in question is of an airsoft gun, and according to the students\u2019 parents, their child didn\u2019t comment on the post but simply liked the picture.\n\nWe\u2019ll wrap up with another bizarre case from this year.\n\nSchool bureaucrats also don\u2019t approve if students engage in legal behavior when they\u2019re not at school.\n\nTwo male students at Lacey Township High School in New Jersey posted photos of guns on Snapchat. One of the boys captioned his photo with \u201chot stuff\u201d and \u201cif there\u2019s ever a zombie apocalypse, you know where to go.\u201d The photos were not taken at school. They were not taken during school hours. They did not reference a school. They auto-deleted after 24 hours, which was well before the school became aware of them. And yet, administrators at Lacey Township High School suspended the boys for three days, and also gave them weekend detention. This was a clear violation of the students\u2019 First Amendment rights, and the American Civil Liberties Union has now filed suit. \u2026The two students had visited a gun range owned by an older brother on Saturday, March 10, 2018. They practiced shooting with \u201clegally purchased and properly permitted\u201d guns, according to the lawsuit. They also took a few photos and posted them on Snapchat. None of the snaps were threatening, and none of them referenced a school. Nevertheless, a parent of another student heard about the photos and contacted school authorities. On Monday, the boys were forced to meet with an assistant principal and an anti-bullying specialist, who quickly decided to punish them for clearly constitutionally-protected speech.\n\nKudos to the ACLU for getting involved on the right side.\n\nI wish it was because they supported the 2nd Amendment as well as the 1st Amendment, but their involvement is a plus regardless.\n\nBut that\u2019s a separate issue.\n\nFor today, our topic is misbehavior by school bureaucrats. Is there a way of discouraging these ridiculous suspensions?\n\nThe good news is that schools often back down when these episodes of political correctness get exposed. And maybe legal action also could help.\n\nBut I suspect the only effective answer is busting up a hopelessly bad government school monopoly.", "description": "I\u2019ve shared\u00a0examples of brain-dead behavior by bureaucrats at the Transportation .10/17/2019 10:23:25AM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
