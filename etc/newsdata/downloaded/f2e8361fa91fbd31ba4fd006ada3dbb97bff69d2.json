And as you might expect, the Buckeyes have dominated, winning 11 straight since the most recent Bearcats victory in 1897, when Ohio State\u2019s schedule included such powerhouses as Ohio Medical and Columbus Barracks. So, yeah, this is a pretty big deal for Cincinnati Coach Luke Fickell \u2014 who not only played at Ohio State but was a longtime Buckeyes assistant and the interim head coach in 2011 \u2014 and the 73 Bearcats players on the roster from Ohio, many of whom were not recruited by the titan to the northeast. \u201cIt\u2019s Ohio State everything, everywhere,\u201d tight end Josiah Deguara said this summer, before Fickell forbade his players from talking publicly about the game. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Cincinnati fans in Cincinnati, but there\u2019s Ohio State fans even in Cincinnati. I think for us we\u2019re just trying to go out and prove there\u2019s not just one team in Ohio. It will be huge for us and huge for our fan base.\u201d \u2026\n\n[Ohio State vs. Cincinnati marks a crossroads, with a connection in New Hampshire]\n\nArmy\u2019s touchdown drives in last week\u2019s 14-7 win over Rice went for 95 and 96 yards. But take away those two scoring sojourns and the Black Knights mustered only 93 yards against one of the nation\u2019s worst defenses in 2018. Michigan, Army\u2019s opponent Saturday, is about 10 steps up in competition and will be getting defensive tackles Michael Dwumfour and Donovan Jeter back after both missed the opener against Middle Tennessee with injuries.\n\n[Michigan vs. Army is a guarantee game -- it guarantees worry for both coaches]\n\nMidafternoon\n\nIf any team has earned the right to feel confident entering its game against Clemson, it\u2019s Texas A&M. The Aggies were one of only two teams to finish within single digits of the national champions last season, falling by just two points in College Station. But there\u2019s confidence, and then there\u2019s this from Texas A&M offensive lineman Jared Hocker on Monday: \u201cThere will be an upset.\u201d Aggies Coach Jimbo Fisher quickly tried to erase the bulletin-board material when asked about it later that day: \u201cJared better play well. It\u2019s great to have confidence, but that doesn\u2019t need to be said.\" \u2026\n\nNebraska did little last weekend to dispel the skeptics who thought its preseason ranking was unwarranted: The Cornhuskers scored twice on defense and once on special teams, but their offense was dismal in a 14-point win over South Alabama, generating only 276 yards. Colorado, Nebraska\u2019s former Big Eight and Big 12 rival, should present a more formidable challenge, though the Buffaloes gave up 505 yards in a win over Colorado State to open the season.\n\nThe late show\n\nAt this point in his coaching career, it\u2019s weird not to mention how good Tom Herman\u2019s teams have fared as underdogs: As head coach at Houston and now Texas, Herman is 13-2-1 against the spread when getting points, winning 10 of those games outright. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, the Longhorns are underdogs at home against LSU, probably for good reason: Unleashing a new spread offense last weekend, Tigers quarterback Joe Burrow threw five touchdown passes before halftime of a 55-3 win over Georgia Southern. Sam Ehlinger almost matched him with touchdown passes on three of the Longhorns\u2019 first four possessions and four scoring strikes total in a similarly easy 45-14 win over Louisiana Tech. But the Longhorns are still mighty green on defense: Just three starters returned from last year, three players made their first career starts against Louisiana Tech, and two were making just their third career starts.\n\n[For LSU\u2019s long-outdated offense, it\u2019s finally geaux time]\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nVirginia Tech takes on Old Dominion a year after upset that rocked the program\n\nNotre Dame\u2019s black leprechaun mascot isn\u2019t putting up with racist criticism\n\nAnalysis: Your college football team rolling in its opener.
