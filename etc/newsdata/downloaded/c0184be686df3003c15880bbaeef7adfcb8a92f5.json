She knew why: the owners now controlled enough money to holiday at one of their several other luxury homes. It didn't sit right, she said.\n\n\u201cIt's just too much to watch that happen at the top and see what is happening at the bottom,\u201d said Ms Munger, 71, a California civil rights lawyer whose father, Charlie, 95, built his fortune as vice-chairman of Warren Buffett's firm Berkshire Hathaway. \u201cIsn't it a waste when beautiful homes on the beach are empty for most of the summer?\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

As Democratic presidential candidates debate a new tax on wealth rather than on incomes, this group of uber-rich people is urging them on.\n\n\u201cI believe in free markets. I'm the daughter of a capitalist. But not Darwin-like free, unregulated and red in tooth and claw,\u201d Ms Munger said.\n\nThe chief argument from these tycoons, financiers and scions is that the government could spend their money more effectively than they could on their own by improving schools, upgrading infrastructure and protecting the environment. It challenges a long-standing belief among many politicians and economists that lower taxes on corporations and investment incomes are the most efficient way to deliver growth and spread wealth down the income ladder.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The group included financier George Soros, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and heiress Abigail Disney, and others often involved in liberal causes. Bill Gates, the world's second richest person, didn't sign it but has since said he \u201cwouldn't be against a wealth tax\u201d on a net worth that roughly exceeds $100bn (\u00a377bn).\n\nWhile Democrats have long pushed for higher taxes on the top income tiers, the current debate goes further \u2014 whether to impose annual taxes on what people own, not just on what they earn.\n\nMassachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren has endorsed a wealth tax on holdings above $50m (\u00a338.7m) that could potentially raise as much as $2.75 trilion (\u00a32.1 trillion) over 10 years. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders' tax would start at $32m (\u00a324.7m). At last week's presidential debate, South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and former Texas representative Beto O'Rourke expressed openness to levying a wealth tax, while Tom Steyer argued for higher taxes on his own $1.6bn (\u00a31.2bn) fortune.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The richest Americans would find ways to avoid it, making it difficult to implement and unlikely to break the hold on politics by powerful companies and rich donors, he said on Friday at a panel on wealth taxes at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Mr Summers estimates that changes to the income tax could raise more than $2 trillion (\u00a31.5 trillion) over 10 years from the top earners, but he doubts that a wealth tax would curb the influence of the richest Americans.\n\nBut the economists who developed the idea dispute the notion that tax avoidance is an unbreakable law of nature. Wealthier Americans paid taxes in the past when tax avoidance was viewed as freeloading, said Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley whose work has drawn attention to the wealth tax as a fix for worsening inequality.\n\n\u201cThe tax system reflects the values of society,\u201d he said.\n\nThe top 1 per cent of Americans hold nearly 40 per cent of the country's wealth, while the bottom 50 per cent of Americans effectively control none of it, according to the World Inequality Database, an index Mr Saez helped develop. Many in the wealthiest sliver of that top 1 per cent pay lower rates than most Americans because of how their income gets taxed, according to his calculations.\n\nCharitable giving by itself simply cannot provide enough money to support public goods and services Robert Bowditch, retired property developer and advocate of a wealth tax\n\nIan Simmons is among the well-off declaring they're ready to pay more.\n\nMr Simmons runs an investment fund called the Blue Haven Initiative with his wife, Liesel Pritzker Simmons. The 43-year-old joined the effort to recruit other moneyed families to support a wealth tax in the June letter.\n\nThe idea of taxing a relatively steady base of trillions of dollars felt consistent to Mr Simmons with what he first learned at the Harvard University introductory economics class taught by Martin Feldstein, who was president Ronald Reagan's economic adviser.\n\n\u201cThis is really a conservative position about increasing the stability of the economy in the long term and having an efficient source of taxation,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Simmons' family money came in part from mail order retailer Montgomery Ward, which opened in 1872, an innovation aided by the US Postal Service. The Hyatt hotel chain that helped form his wife's family fortune was aided by the government's construction of the interstate highway system.\n\nThat's part of the reason he supports a wealth tax - because his family's fortune stems in part from government programmes, echoing Ms Warren's key argument for her tax plan.\n\nWhen Mr Simmons called the retired real estate developer Robert Bowditch this year to endorse the idea, the 80-year-old did the maths on what it would mean for his own lifestyle. He figured it would cut into some of his charitable giving, but the returns would be much greater because the public would be able to decide in a democratic fashion on how the money would be spent.\n\n\u201cCharitable giving by itself simply cannot provide enough money to support public goods and services, such as public education, roads and bridges, clean air,\u201d Mr Bowditch said. \u201cIt has to be done by taxes.\u201d\n\nRich people have had limited success as advocates for tax hikes. In 2011, billionaire Warren Buffett's declaration that he paid a lower tax rate than his employees spawned president Barack Obama's proposal to raise rates on people making more than $1m (\u00a3770,000.) The so-called \u201cBuffett rule\u201d fizzled in Congress.\n\nIn 1999, when Mr Trump was mulling a presidential bid for the Reform Party, he proposed a one-time tax of 14.25 per cent on fortunes above $10m (\u00a37.7m), saying at the time that it could eliminate the national debt.\n\n\u201cIt's a win-win for the American people,\u201d Mr Trump said then. Asked if the president still supports the idea, the White House did not respond.\n\nAP", "description": "When the grand vacation homes of Newport Beach were empty on a beautiful Memorial Day weekend, Molly Munger decided it was time for the US\u00a0to consider taxing wealth.
