Mexican lawmakers have already done so.\n\nThe long-awaited response from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer sets the stage for weeks of intense negotiations before a congressional vote on the agreement that will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nDemocrats, who control the House, said they would decide on next steps after reviewing the administration\u2019s response to the written recommendations they had submitted in July on how to strengthen the proposed trade pact.\n\n\u201cWe have paper back from USTR that\u2019s being reviewed and then we will move from there,\u201d Representative Rosa DeLauro said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has urged Congress to approve the trade pact, known as USMCA, but Democrats have said they will only proceed when their concerns about enforcement of the labor and environmental provisions, and certain pharmaceutical issues, are addressed.\n\nIn the past, Trump has threatened to pull out of NAFTA, which he sees as detrimental to American businesses and farmers.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said that she wants to \u201cget to yes\u201d on the deal, but first needed revisions.\n\nDetails of the Democrats\u2019 formal proposals and Lighthizer\u2019s response were not available.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s discussions with Lighthizer, Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, urged House approval of the USMCA before Canada\u2019s national elections, which are set for Oct. 21.\n\nJordan Haas, director of trade policy for the Internet Association, said his group was upbeat that the two sides would reach agreement paving the way for passage of USMCA.\n\n\u201cWe are pretty optimistic that the USMCA agreement will be passed. USTR has signaled that there are landing zones to address the Democrat\u2019s concerns, and they are working toward a deal,\u201d he said.\n\nThe group and 10 others on Monday urged Congress to pass the trade agreement, but not to give the Trump administration the power to change thresholds for duty-free shipments into the United States.", "description": "The Trump administration on Wednesday sent U.S. House of Representatives Democrats its latest proposals for addressing legislators' concerns about the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal, lawmakers and congressional sources said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428911413&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1RN-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
