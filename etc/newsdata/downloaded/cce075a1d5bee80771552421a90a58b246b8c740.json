No more pricey trips to the nail salon. Photo: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nI\u2019ve spent years trying to get a grip on my dry, callused feet. I\u2019ve cycled through all the usual methods \u2014 and the truth is that none of them are actually all that great. I paid my local nail salon anywhere from \u00a315 to \u00a325 every two weeks to have a go at my feet, with only so-so results. I spent \u00a315 on the Japanese foot peel known as Baby Foot, which is trendy but takes five-plus days to work \u2014 and I\u2019m all about getting things done right the hell now. I\u2019ve even tried attacking my calluses at home with an old-school pumice stone, but it takes forever and involves way too much elbow grease for my taste.\n\nThen I had the bright idea to take a peek at what my pedicurist was using while she attacked my calluses a few weeks ago \u2014 and hustled myself over to Amazon to order exactly what she used. It was one of the smartest things I\u2019ve done in forever, because I\u2019m now the owner of two soft, smooth, very uncallused feet. (And it took very little effort on my part.)\n\nProLinc Callus Eliminator The product she used is ProLinc\u2019s Callus Eliminator, which promises to break down calluses and dry-skin buildup in three to five minutes. A four-ounce bottle lasts at least 15 uses, and I\u2019m here to tell you that it does exactly what it says it will (as evidenced by close to 500 five-star reviews). Here\u2019s how it works: Soak your feet in a tub of warm water for five minutes. (I use an inflatable tub because it\u2019s easy to break down and store in between uses.) Apply a thin coating of ProLinc Callus Eliminator to your rough, callused foot parts, using a paper towel (you can also just use your hands, but make sure to wash them immediately afterward). Wait three to five minutes (no longer, as it could start to burn), then wipe any excess product off your foot with a tissue. Finally, it\u2019s scraping time. I like using a pedicure-specific rasp (though an old-school Mr. Pumice stone works well, too) and go to town. You\u2019ll be shocked at how easily your calluses are turned to dust. Give them a good rinse, apply your favorite foot cream, and you\u2019re done. Oh, and here\u2019s a bit of free advice from someone who knows: Stop scraping once you\u2019ve made a little bit of progress, and then have another go at it a few days later. Don\u2019t get too overzealous the very first time \u2014 as your feet are meant to have a certain amount of calluses on them for a reason. I found this out the hard way and wound up walking around a bit gingerly for days on end. \u00a315 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nMore Strategist-recommended foot products\n\nCeraVe Renewing SA Cream \u00a317 (was \u00a318, now 6% off) Writer Hannah Morrill introduced us to this foot cream that moisturizes while exfoliating during Feet Week: \u2018The best contender I\u2019ve found for this job?
