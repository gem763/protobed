But in many places they are considered vital to protect land and property that would otherwise be swept out to sea.\n\nHigh tides batter the seawall at Butterfly Beach in Santa Barbara, California.

But the new promenade's true public value will only be measured by how well it succeeds in shielding people from natural disaster.\n\nA visualization from Governor Andrew Cuomo's \"coastal resiliency project\".

Some of the earliest examples have stood the test of time, albeit only after regular reinforcement.\n\nIn India's Puducherry, formerly known as Pondicherry, a seawall constructed by the French in 1735 is credited with saving lives in 2004, when the Asian tsunami threw successive walls of water at the coast.\n\nOn the other side of the Indian subcontinent, villagers along the Kerala coast have been campaigning local authorities to erect new seawalls to stop their homes from being swept out to sea.\n\nThe sea is threatening homes along the Indian coast.

In some cases, bags are being filled with vegetation from the local area, said P. I. Sheik Pareeth, managing director of the Kerala State Coastal Area Development Corporation.\n\n\"Mostly granite is being used but in some cases we are using vegetation -- a particular type of vegetation from the trees there,\" Pareeth said.\n\nThe design of seawalls has evolved over time, from rock -- which is still used -- to interlocking concrete units, including the Tetrapods commonly seen in Japan. When rock isn't available, concrete can be more cost-efficient, allowing large numbers of correctly-sized parts to be produced.\n\nIn recent years there's been a greater push towards natural solutions -- using dunes, mangroves and man-made reefs alongside man-made walls to help calm the sea.\n\n\"We're not only building a structure that is functional in an engineering sense but it's functional in an environmental sense,\" said Matt Eliot, a coastal engineer and direct of Seashore Engineering based in Perth, Australia. \"We're using that to look for what habitats we can encourage to make it better for the plants and animals in the area.\"\n\nIn some cases, holes and crevices are being built into the walls to encourage nature to grow around them. Other designs seek to reduce the impact of waves before they hit.\n\nConcrete made tetrapods along Maruma beach, Yaeyama Islands, Iriomote, Japan.

The hard engineering is complemented by 21 acres of new habitats for oysters, mangroves, dune grass and seagrass, as well as a nesting ground for birds.\n\nAn aerial image of Fort Pierce Marina by local photographer Joseph Semkow.

However, she added, seawalls can only restrain the coast for so long.\n\n\"Human beings cannot engineer nature forever, either positively or negatively. People will push back, particularly those with private property interests ... but eventually a decision will need to be made, which will be: you can't live here anymore,\" O'Donnell said.\n\nEliot said that while some seawalls have been shown to work for centuries, engineering is not \"a magic solution\" for a disappearing coast.\n\n\"If you have erosion pressure, that means there's a deficit of sediment somewhere. You cannot make sand reappear, so all you are doing by coastal engineering is pushing that pressure to a new location,\" Eliot said.\n\nIn New York, the first contracts for the Staten Island seawall are expected to be awarded next summer, with work to begin soon after, according to the USACE.\n\nThe design also includes wetlands, and is part of the New York Mayor Bill de Blasio's $10 billion scheme to \"climate-proof\" New York City, an investment he says is needed to tackle a \"national emergency.\"\n\n\"New York doesn't have a choice but to prepare for what's coming. Neither does Miami, Houston, Charleston or any of the coastal cities facing an existential threat to their future,\" De Blasio wrote in an article in March for a New York magazine.\n\nAnd it's not just US cities facing the threat of rising water. Major international cities including Jakarta in Indonesia and Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam -- home to a combined 18 million people -- are under urgent pressure to act.\n\nWith so many people living so close to the sea, the potential losses are staggering-- and the financial cost of creating a durable solution is rising by the day.\n\n\"The longer we take to mitigate against climate change, the more expensive it's going to be to adapt to a changing climate,\" O'Donnell said.", "description": "By 2025, New York's Staten Island will be fortified by a towering seawall running 5.3 miles along the coast, an engineering feat designed to ward off a growing threat.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190709090252-01-staten-island-seawall-graphic-visualization-super-tease.jpg"}
