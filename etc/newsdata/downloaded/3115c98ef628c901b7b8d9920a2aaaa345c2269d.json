Not so fast.\n\nCiting sources familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Disney and Amazon are currently duking it out over an ad space-grab by Amazon on Disney apps. The rumoured beef is not only part of the reason Fire TV has not yet secured a deal to offer Disney+, the Journal said, but could also result in Disney\u2019s various apps \u2014 including ABC, ESPN and Disney Channel \u2014 getting yanked from Fire TV as well.\n\nWhile Disney+, which launches in just over a month, is an ad-free, subscription-based service, the Journal reported that Amazon\u2019s desire to secure a \u201csubstantial percentage\u201d of ads on Disney\u2019s various other apps has impacted the talks for over a potential Disney+ offering on Fire TV. According to the Journal, Amazon\u2019s ad-grab comes as the company pushes for greater avenues for revenue outside of its cloud services:\n\nWhen Fire TV was first launched, it allowed a number of media companies to have apps on its platform without sharing any advertising revenue, people familiar with the situation said. But lately Amazon has been tightening its proposed terms in discussions with certain programmers, the people said.\n\nDisney confirmed in August it had secured global distribution agreements to stream Disney+ on Apple devices including Apple TV, Chromecast and Android devices, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Amazon, however, did not appear in the release.\n\nDisney reportedly thinks that its apps and forthcoming streaming service put it in a good position to push back against Amazon\u2019s demands. Citing its sources, the Journal reported that the two companies have recently discussed a 10 per cent share for Amazon in ad space, even though Amazon reportedly starts its negotiations at around 40 per cent with the hope of securing between 20 to 30 per cent.\n\nNeither Disney nor Amazon immediately returned a request for comment about the report.\n\nWith its Fire TV, Amazon holds a significant percentage of the market for streaming devices, with the company claiming it reaches 37 million active global users.\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty significant number of eyeballs should Disney+ reach an agreement with Amazon to make its product available on Fire TV. But, to Disney\u2019s benefit, Amazon missing a streaming offering with so much content at launch \u2014 be it the Simpsons library, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, and of course all of its Disney content \u2014 could certainly be a detriment to the company, considering Disney+ is launching on many Fire TV rivals.\n\nAccording to the Journal, some of the sources it spoke to said they were optimistic that Amazon and Disney could reach some kind of truce over the ad beef \u2014 though to secure the service before its launch in November, negotiations would need to move fast. At the very least, we have every indication that Disney\u2019s planning to elbow its way to the front of the pack as these streaming services vie for our eyeballs as well as our wallets.\n\nPull up a seat, and grab the popcorn.", "description": "Holding out for Disney+ on Fire TV?
