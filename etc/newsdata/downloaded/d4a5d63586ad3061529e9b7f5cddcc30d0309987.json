Stanley, grand master of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Maryland, a national fraternal organization to which Cummings belonged. \u201cNow he is dancing with the angels.\u201d\n\nCummings died Oct. 17, at age 68, of \u201ccomplications concerning long-standing health challenges,\u201d his office said in a statement. The memorial at the public historically black research university, where Cummings served on the board of regents, was the first of a series of tributes planned for this week, including lying in state at the U.S. Capitol on Thursday and a funeral in Baltimore on Friday.\n\nAs chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings was a regular on television news panels and a leading figure in the Trump impeachment inquiry. Before his death, he had been out of his office for weeks while recovering from an unspecified medical procedure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong the mourners Wednesday was Noreen Wright, 59, a home health-care nurse, who brought her 9- and 12-year-old grandsons, saying she wanted them to witness history.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an icon,\u201d Wright said of Cummings. \u201cHe\u2019s someone that the next generation can look at to see how it\u2019s supposed to be done.\u201d\n\nWith tears in her eyes, Wright said Cummings was a modern-day civil rights leader. \u201cHe\u2019s like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe stood for the rights of people.\u201d\n\nJacqui Williams, 79, a former Baltimore City teacher, said she came because she felt she \u201chad to show honor and loyalty to a man who always showed it to us.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Cummings\u2019s body will lie in state in National Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol. An 11 a.m. \u201carrival ceremony\u201d will feature remarks from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer and Sen. Ben Cardin, both Maryland Democrats.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Morgan State University Choir will perform, and a bipartisan group of leaders from the House and Senate will participate in a wreath-laying, Pelosi\u2019s office said.\n\nA public viewing will follow from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. via the Capitol Visitor Center.\n\nCummings\u2019s funeral will be held at 10 a.m. Friday at New Psalmist Baptist Church, the West Baltimore church where he worshiped for decades.\n\nThe event at Morgan State began in the morning with a viewing and ran through the evening with a public ceremony for elected officials to celebrate his life.\n\nJocelyn Daniels, 19, a Morgan State sophomore who worked as an intern on Capitol Hill, said she will remember Cummings as a congressman who \u201cwas forceful and powerful.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe stood for his convictions,\u201d said her friend, Aaron Quartey, 21, a junior at the university.\n\nAD", "description": "The longtime congressman is remembered as a civil rights hero at the historically black university.", "authors": ["Ovetta Wiggins", "Local Reporter Covering Maryland State Politics", "Jenna Portnoy", "Reporter Covering Virginia", "Maryland", "D.C.
