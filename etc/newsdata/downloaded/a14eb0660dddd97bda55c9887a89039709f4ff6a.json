We believe in life, and whatever gifts God gives us, we accept them. And this is gonna be a great gift,\u201d Duffy added. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s gonna be a little more stressful, but this little baby will have eight other siblings to wrap their loving arms around her, and we\u2019re gonna do it as a family.
