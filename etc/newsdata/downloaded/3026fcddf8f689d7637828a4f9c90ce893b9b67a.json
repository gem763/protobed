Photo: A. R. Coster/Getty Images\n\nIn our advice column, Ask the Strategist, we take your most burning shopping questions and survey friends, call up experts, and draw on our own personal experience to answer them. As always, please comment with any questions of your own \u2014 we\u2019re here to help.\n\nI\u2019m looking for black winter weatherproof boots that lace up (no zipper on the side), and are not a duck boot/Sorel type. Ideally, I could run around the city in the boots and handle several inches of snow upstate, and would spend around $200 or less. Sleek would be great \u2014 I love Aquatalia lace up styles, but they\u2019re cost prohibitive and all the other boots I\u2019ve seen are either very expensive or very fugly.\n\nI love that you provided Aquatalia as a reference. The two weatherproof styles that popped up when I did a quick search for the brand\u2019s boots really are sleek-looking. (I agree that clunky Sorels and duck boots aren\u2019t great for everyday wear; they\u2019re definitely more of an \u201coccasional\u201d boot \u2014 the occasion being inclement weather.) While the two Aquatalias I found are expensive, they both have pretty classic shapes \u2014 combat boot and hiking-inspired \u2014 that thankfully aren\u2019t too hard to find at a lower price point. Below is a selection of lace-up boots in both shapes that are, at the very least, waterproof and in your price range. Many of them also happen to be pretty sleek, if I do say so myself.\n\nLace-up black winter boots\n\nMerrell Legacy Lace Waterproof When I think of Merrell, \u201csleek\u201d is the last word I\u2019d use to describe the brand. But I actually kind of love these boots. They look like a combat-hiking hybrid and have a couple of hooked eyelets at the top and a woolen cuff that adds a nice touch, even if it means the boots are not all black. Plus, the leather shaft can be folded down Peter-Pan style if you want to show more of the cuff. They\u2019re waterproof with a breathable plaid lining and a grippy rubber sole, yet still manage to have a rather slim silhouette. I might have to get these myself. $180 at Zappos Buy\n\nKodiak Original Fleece Waterproof Bootie Here\u2019s a more straightforward hiking style from Kodiak, which calls itself \u201cCanada\u2019s boot maker.\u201d (Hey, if they\u2019re good enough for our neighbors up north, then I bet they\u2019re good enough for us New Yorkers.) They\u2019re waterproof, lined with Thinsulate and high-pile fleece to keep your feet toasty, and have a treaded rubber sole for traction. The two-tone leather upper makes them a bit more interesting (and reminds of the Aquatalia styles above). They\u2019re not as dressy \u2014 the metal eyelets make them feel more utilitarian \u2014 but I think they still look pretty nice for being winter boots, and could easily be dressed up, too, without looking like you just trekked through a blizzard. $155 at Nordstrom Buy $145 at Zappos Buy\n\nKodiak Original All Season If you prefer a simpler pair without the plush lining, try Kodiak\u2019s all-season boot, which is lined in microfiber and also waterproof. $155 at Zappos Buy\n\nTimberland Jayne Waterproof Hiking Bootie Or, if you don\u2019t mind a little extra bulk, consider these waterproof hiking boots from Timberland. They have a much sleeker silhouette than that of the brand\u2019s ubiquitous work boots, but still have all the features \u2014 thick rubber lug sole, cushioned foot bed, and padded leather collar \u2014 you need for trekking through rain and snow. The polished leather makes them a little dressier, and the camo cuff and swirly green eyelets are fun. $160 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nTimberland Jayne Waterproof Teddy Fleece Fold Down $140 (was $160, now 13% off) Here\u2019s another pair of Timbs that look especially toasty, thanks to their fleece lining and fold-down fleece collar (when the snow piles up, they can also be worn with the shaft all the way up for a more combat-boot-like look). The contrasting smooth leather-and-suede upper is also an interesting design detail. $140 at Zappos Buy\n\nTimberland Jayne Waterproof Genuine Shearling Trim Bootie To make more of a statement (think Hollywood starlet at Sundance), might I suggest these Timbs with a cozy shearling cuff and super wide laces that don\u2019t require tying \u2014 simply pull them on and off. I think they\u2019re sturdy enough without being too bulky, but these are definitely a more substantial boot than others on this list. $180 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nCougar Derry Waterproof Boot For something that leans more toward the hiking-boot look, try this pair from Cougar (another Canadian performance brand). The waterproof leather boots with lug soles have a plush fleece lining and a knit collar to keep your feet extra dry and cozy. While this isn\u2019t the sleekest boot, it also doesn\u2019t scream \u201cwinter shoe,\u201d either. $180 at Nordstrom Buy $180 at Zappos Buy\n\nBlundstone BL1931 Of course, you could always just get a pair of Blundstones. These are a tad over-budget, but they\u2019re all black and lace up, making them slightly more fitted than the Australian brand\u2019s classic Chelsea style. They\u2019re also water-resistant and have a slip-resistant sole. $225 at Zappos Buy\n\nLace-up black winter boots (with side zips)\n\nYou specified that you wanted black lace-up winter boots without side zippers, but I found some boots with zippers that otherwise fit all your criteria \u2014 black, weatherproof, sleek \u2014 and look too nice not to mention. I dare say that a couple of them are even sleeker than the ones above.\n\nBlondo Prima Waterproof Lace-up Boot Canada\u2019s got the market cornered on stylish, cold-weather footwear. Blondo, another company from up north, has been around for more than 100 years, so it probably knows a thing or two about keeping your feet protected from the elements. All of its shoes are waterproof, including this suede combat-style boot that features a special seal to protect against water, calcium, and salt. A lug sole provides traction, and a side zip makes it easier to put on and take off. I like these a lot \u2014 especially since they don\u2019t look like winter shoes at all. $152 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nMunro Bradley Water Resistant Boot These could pass as non-winter boots, too, thanks to cute details like the buckle. Although they cost more than $200, the lightweight boots have a water-resistant upper, fleece lining, and a thick lugged sole appropriate for slushy sidewalks and snowy hikes. Another pair that I would seriously consider for myself. $245 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nKodiak Callwood Waterproof Bootie If you want a tall combat boot like the Aquatalias, you might like these streamlined waterproof boots that have a high shaft and buckled cuff \u2014 ideal for both trudging through snow and ambling around the city. A side zip offers easy on-and-off, while a microfleece lining provides extra moisture-wicking warmth. $185 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nVionic Jayce Bootie Here\u2019s another option that doesn\u2019t look like a bulky winter shoe but still offers waterproof protection. While this reads dressier (it comes with both ribbon and regular laces), it features a water-resistant leather upper and a removable, podiatrist-designed orthotic insole with arch support. These seem best to wear on a rainy day, as you might want something a little more substantial when it\u2019s snowing out (the sole is made of rubber, but it doesn\u2019t have much by way of grip). $190 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
