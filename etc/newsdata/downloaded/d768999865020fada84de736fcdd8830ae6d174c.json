However, that changes on Thursday, when Harry travels solo to Botswana, Angola, and Malawi, while Markle will remain in South Africa.\n\nAccording to royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams, this was planned so that Markle can take care of baby Archie.\n\nArchie made his first appearance on tour on Wednesday.

In Malawi he will champion conservation as in Botswana where his activities will also be linked to Sentebale, the charity he founded in Lesotho in 2006 which helps the vulnerable, especially victims of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\"\n\nHe said the trip is \"a carefully balanced tour in a part of the world which we know has a very special place in their hearts.\"\n\nThe couple are set to meet famous figures, including Nelson Mandela's widow Graca Machel.\n\nOn Wednesday, they met with Archbishop Desmond Tutu \u2014 and delighted fans by sharing a video showing baby Archie was along for the engagement.\n\nRead more: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry just posted an adorable video of baby Archie, and it's the most we've ever seen of him\n\nThe couple will reunite for the final day of the tour on Wednesday, October 2, where they will meet local youth and entrepreneurs in a township near Johannesburg.\n\nArchie is younger than the Cambridge children were on their first tours\n\nDespite being born without a royal title \u2014 unlike William and Middleton's children \u2014 Archie is making history as the youngest royal to embark on an overseas tour.\n\nGeorge was nine months old when he joined his parents in Australia and New Zealand, while Princess Charlotte was 16 months old during the family's tour of Canada in 2016.\n\nKate Middleton, Prince William, Princess Charlotte, and Prince George in Canada.
