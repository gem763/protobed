These rankings are not fantasy-driven in any way, though I will include nuggets of more abstract fantasy advice here and there inside the individual team write-ups. Who\u2019s hot, who\u2019s not -- that sort of thing. Send any and all complaints to me on Twitter: @drewsilv. Please believe me when I tell you that I do not hate your team.\n\n1. Houston Astros\n\nRecord: 95-50\n\nLast Week: 1\n\nIt has been a crazy couple of days at Minute Maid Park, with the Astros exploding for a 21-1 victory in Sunday's series finale against the visiting Mariners before steamrolling the Athletics in a 15-0 blowout win on Monday. Houston set numerous team and personal records in that short stretch -- too many to list in this space. Focusing in on Yordan Alvarez, he contributed three doubles to the Astros' team-record 11 doubles on Sunday and then set a new franchise single-season rookie home run mark on Monday with his 23rd and 24th home runs of 2019. The 22-year-old Cuban slugger has 72 RBI through his first 71 major league games.\n\n2. New York Yankees\n\nRecord: 95-50\n\nLast Week: 2\n\nJames Paxton delivered 6 2/3 scoreless innings as the Yankees shut out the Red Sox for a 5-0 win on Monday night at Fenway Park, officially bouncing Boston from the American League East title race in the process. The Yankees won 14 of their 19 games this year versus their arch rival, which is the most wins the Yankees have tallied in a single season against the Red Sox since 1960. The Yankees are up nine games in the AL East on the second-place Rays -- Boston sits in third --- and their magic number to clinch the division is down to nine. There could be a celebration this weekend in Toronto.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nRecord: 93-52\n\nLast Week: 3\n\nLos Angeles nearly got swept by the rival Giants over the weekend, in Bruce Bochy's final visit to Dodger Stadium, but Julio Urias, Kenta Maeda, Casey Sadler, Yimi Garcia, Adam Kolarek, and Josh Sborz combined for a four-hit shutout in a 5-0 win over San Francisco on Sunday afternoon. Urias, 23, owns a 2.48 ERA, 1.09 WHIP, and 74 strikeouts in 72 2/3 innings this season and should help steady the bullpen down the stretch and into the playoffs now that he's back from a domestic violence and abuse suspension. The magic number to clinch the NL West is at one as the Dodgers open a series Tuesday in Baltimore.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Stay ahead of the competition from wire to wire with rankings, customizable projections, trade evaluator, exclusive columns and more in our Season Pass.

Atlanta Braves\n\nRecord: 90-55\n\nLast Week: 4\n\nRonald Acuna slugged his 38th home run of the season in the Braves' 7-2 victory over the Phillies on Monday and is now just two homers and six stolen bases away from registering the fifth 40-40 season in MLB history. The four to accomplish the feat: Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, and Alfonso Soriano. Acuna and the Braves are on a roll, having won 17 of their last 20 games to jump out 9 1/2 games on first place in the National League East standings. Their magic number to clinch the division is 10. Quick note: Nick Markakis (wrist) could be activated off the injured list as early as Friday.\n\n5. Minnesota Twins\n\nRecord: 88-55\n\nLast Week: 5\n\nThe Twins look to be closing in on their first American League Central title since 2010, but concerns have emerged all across this roster. The big recent blow was Michael Pineda getting hit with a 60-game suspension on Saturday after testing positive for a banned diuretic that is sometimes used as a masking agent for performance-enhancing drugs. He had a 2.76 ERA over his last 65 1/3 innings dating back to late June and was probably going to be the Game 1 starter for Minnesota in the ALDS. And then there are the injuries to Nelson Cruz, Byron Buxton, Marwin Gonzalez, Sam Dyson, and Max Kepler.\n\n6. Tampa Bay Rays\n\nRecord: 86-59\n\nLast Week: 8\n\nThe Rays have won five straight and 10 of their last 11. Entering play on Tuesday, they are up 1 1/2 games on the top American League Wild Card spot. Austin Meadows earned AL Player of the Week honors for the second time this season after going 12-for-23 (.522) with four home runs, two doubles, eight RBI and nine runs scored in seven games between September 2-8. The 24-year-old outfielder was acquired from the Pirates last summer as part of the Chris Archer trade. Tyler Glasnow, also acquired in the Archer deal, returned Sunday from a four-month rehabilitation for a right forearm strain.\n\n7. St. Louis Cardinals\n\nRecord: 81-62\n\nLast Week: 7\n\nThe Cardinals took three of four from the Giants last week before picking up two more victories in a three-game weekend series at Pittsburgh's PNC Park. They are 37-18 so far in the second half, after carrying a record of 44-44 into the All-Star break, and currently hold a four-game lead over the Cubs for first place in the National League Central standings. Jack Flaherty deserves a lot of credit for the turnaround in St. Louis and may wind up with a top-five finish in the NL Cy Young Award balloting. The 23-year-old right-hander boasts a 0.80 ERA over his last 78 1/3 innings dating back to July 7.\n\n8. Oakland Athletics\n\nRecord: 84-60\n\nLast Week: 9\n\nMike Fiers, who was 12-0 with a 2.59 ERA over his previous 21 starts, got hammered for nine earned runs while recording only three outs as the Athletics got bullied by the Astros in a 15-0 blowout loss on Monday. Oakland is now 10 1/2 games back of Houston for first place in the American League West and only a half-game up on the Indians for the second AL Wild Card spot. It's great to see Sean Manaea back and helping the cause. The left-hander has allowed just one run on three hits over 12 innings (two starts) since returning last week from major shoulder surgery. Jesus Luzardo arrived Monday as further pitching assistance.\n\n9. Cleveland Indians\n\nRecord: 84-61\n\nLast Week: 10\n\nShane Bieber tallied eight strikeouts over seven innings of one-run ball on Monday night in Anaheim as the Indians cruised to a 7-2 victory over the host Angels to climb within a half-game of the Athletics for the second American League Wild Card spot. They are five games back of the Twins for first place in the American League Central. Bieber was the 39th starting pitcher off the board this spring in the average Yahoo draft -- Rick Porcello, Nick Pivetta, and Kyle Freeland territory -- and has delivered an ace-like 3.17 ERA, 1.00 WHIP, and 241/38 K/BB ratio in 195 2/3 innings. The 24-year-old also has a team-high 14 wins.\n\n10. Washington Nationals\n\nRecord: 79-63\n\nLast Week: 6\n\nThe Nationals entered the month of September as the hottest team in baseball, but they've lost five of their last seven games and their next three series are against clubs that currently lead their respective divisions -- the Twins, Braves, and Cardinals. They need to survive that stretch and then line up Max Scherzer to work the National League Wild Card Game. A milestone from last week: Juan Soto reached 100 RBI on Saturday, becoming just the sixth player to accomplish that feat in his age-20 season. The other five: Alex Rodriguez, Al Kaline, Ted Williams, Mel Ott, and Ty Cobb.\n\n11. Chicago Cubs\n\nRecord: 77-66\n\nLast Week: 11\n\nJavier Baez is done for the remainder of the regular season -- and possibly the playoffs -- after being diagnosed on Saturday with a hairline fracture in his left thumb. Addison Russell, meanwhile, is still in concussion protocol after taking a pitch to the head on Sunday afternoon. Desperate for someone to cover the shortstop position, the Cubs called up 2018 first-rounder Nico Hoerner on Monday and gave him his first MLB start in their series opener at San Diego's Petco Park. Hoerner rose to the challenge, becoming the second Cubs player since 1920 to register three hits and four RBI in his debut as Chicago went on to win 10-2.\n\n12. Milwaukee Brewers\n\nRecord: 75-68\n\nLast Week: 15\n\nDon't count out the Brewers just yet. They took three of four from the division-rival Cubs over the weekend and then took care of the Marlins for an 8-3 victory on Monday night as Trent Grisham went 5-for-6 and finished a home run short of the cycle. Milwaukee has won seven of its last nine, and eight of those nine games were against contending teams. As it stands here on Tuesday afternoon, this club is two games back of the second National League Wild Card spot with 19 games to play. And the rest-of-season schedule is favorable: 3 @ MIA, 3 @ STL, 4 vs. SD, 3 vs. PIT, 3 @ CIN, 3 @ COL.\n\n13. Arizona Diamondbacks\n\nRecord: 75-69\n\nLast Week: 16\n\nThe Diamondbacks fell 3-1 to the Mets on Monday and they also lost their series finale in Cincinnati on Sunday by a score of 4-3, but this team had won 11 of its last 12 leading into those back-to-back defeats and a path to the National League Wild Card Game remains open here on Tuesday afternoon. Ketel Marte was named National League Player of the Week for September 2-8 after going 13-for-24 (.542) with four home runs, two doubles, a triple, and 14 RBI over that six-game stretch. The 25-year-old is pushing for a third-place finish in the NL MVP voting behind Christian Yelich and Cody Bellinger.\n\n14. Boston Red Sox\n\nRecord: 76-68\n\nLast Week: 12\n\nThe Red Sox won the World Series just over 10 months ago and currently sit eight games above .500, even after a rough loss to the rival Yankees on Monday. But team president Dave Dombrowski was fired late Sunday night and ownership offered only a press release -- no formal press conference -- in announcing the move. Evan Drellich of The Athletic has some inside dirt on the decision: \"Processes during Dombrowski\u2019s tenure were sometimes chaotic. He did not take full advantage of the available information and resources. There were many days when functionality inside the Red Sox front office felt like a minor miracle to the people around him. ... The short version: Dombrowski is out because he spent a huge amount of money and was no longer delivering results.\"\n\n15. Philadelphia Phillies\n\nRecord: 74-69\n\nLast Week: 14\n\nAaron Nola allowed four earned runs over six innings Monday as the Phillies lost 7-2 to the Braves while falling three games back of the Cubs for the second National League Wild Card spot. This team is technically still alive, but with six more games against Atlanta, two against the Red Sox, three against the Indians, and five against the Nationals, it's difficult to envision a late-season push. The situation in Philly is not Nola's fault, but he has yielded nine earned runs over his last 10 innings (two starts) and has a 3.70 ERA in 184 2/3 total innings this season. He posted a 2.37 ERA in 212 1/3 innings last year.\n\n16. New York Mets\n\nRecord: 73-70\n\nLast Week: 13\n\nThe simmering frustration for Mets fans boiled over yet again this weekend after manager Mickey Callaway offered a rambling and nonsensical reasoning behind his decision to intentionally walk Phillies catcher Andrew Knapp in the seventh inning of an eventual 10-7 loss. That move created a bases-loaded pinch-hitting appearance for Bryce Harper, who drew a run-scoring base-on-balls. There are plenty of fingers to point at player performance this year in Queens -- it was Tyler Bashlor and his 8.05 ERA who issued the walk to Harper -- but Callaway is more than just a scapegoat.\n\n17. Texas Rangers\n\nRecord: 72-73\n\nLast Week: 17\n\nTexas beat up on the Orioles this past weekend in Baltimore, winning all four games of a four-game series at Camden Yards by a combined score of 29-15, but the schedule turns a whole lot tougher over the remainder of the 2019 regular season. Here's how the Rangers will close this year out, needing a 9-8 run to finish .500: 3 vs. TB, 3 vs. OAK, 2 @ HOU, 3 @ OAK, 3 vs. BOS, 3 vs. NYY. \"We're trying to win every game,\" Rangers manager Chris Woodward told reporters on Sunday evening. \"What a great experience for our guys to finish the season on. I want our guys to fight to the end.\"\n\n18. San Francisco Giants\n\nRecord: 69-75\n\nLast Week: 18\n\nRetiring manager Bruce Bochy nearly pushed his lifetime record at Dodger Stadium above .500, but the Giants couldn't finish off a three-game weekend sweep of the Dodgers, losing 5-0 in the series finale on Sunday after earning surprising wins on Friday and Saturday. Bochy still goes out with the most career managerial victories (107) in the 57-year history of that ballpark in Chavez Ravine. It will take a 12-6 finish from this year's Giants team to send Bochy off with a better than .500 record in his farewell campaign. They play the Pirates, Marlins, Red Sox, Braves, Rockies, and Dodgers to round things out.\n\n19. Cincinnati Reds\n\nRecord: 67-77\n\nLast Week: 21\n\nThe Reds have the opportunity to play spoiler down the stretch with upcoming series against the Wild Card-contending Diamondbacks, Cubs, and Brewers, but the real thing to watch for in Cincinnati is how many milestones Eugenio Suarez can achieve over what remains of the 2019 regular season. The 28-year-old third baseman has 10 home runs in his last 14 games and 44 home runs for the year. He is three home runs back of the current MLB leader, Pete Alonso, who's at 47. Suarez is eight home runs away from George Foster's single-season franchise record of 52.\n\n20. Los Angeles Angels\n\nRecord: 67-78\n\nLast Week: 19\n\nYou never want to see \"Mike Trout\" and \"procedure\" in the same sentence, but the game's best player required a cryoablation procedure on Monday morning to address a neuroma in his right foot and will be sidelined for at least a couple more days. He hasn't played a full game since the Angels' 10-6 loss in Oakland last Thursday. Trout should still run away with the 2019 American League MVP, even if he is somewhat limited down the stretch. The 28-year-old outfielder has slugged a career-high 45 home runs with a 1.083 OPS, 104 RBI, 11 stolen bases, and 110 runs scored in 134 games this season.\n\n21. San Diego Padres\n\nRecord: 66-77\n\nLast Week: 20\n\nCal Quantrill surrendered eight earned runs for the third consecutive outing as the Padres lost 10-2 to the Cubs on Monday night in San Diego to drop 11 games under the .500 mark. They are 10-13 since rookie phenom Fernando Tatis Jr. landed on the injured list with a stress reaction in his lower back on August 16. We could soon hear about an early shutdown for Quantrill and Chris Paddack. Quantrill has watched his ERA rise from 3.32 to 5.12 in less than three weeks. Paddack, while still posting good results, has already logged 39 2/3 more innings than he did last year in the minors.\n\n22. Pittsburgh Pirates\n\nRecord: 63-81\n\nLast Week: 22\n\nThe Pirates lost two of three to both the Cardinals and Marlins last week, but they managed a 6-4 come-from-behind victory on Monday night in San Francisco and are 10-6 over their last 16 games, perhaps threatening to play a little spoiler down the stretch against a couple of National League Central foes. Pittsburgh has six games left against the second-place Cubs (September 13-15, September 24-26) and three against the third-place Brewers (September 20-22). Call it Hurdle (and Huntington's?) Last Stand. The Bucs went 5-14 this year against the first-place Cardinals.\n\n23. Chicago White Sox\n\nRecord: 63-80\n\nLast Week: 23\n\nIt would have been fun to get a glimpse of top outfield prospect Luis Robert in this final stretch of mostly-meaningless games on the South Side of Chicago, but he's a victim of the service time maneuvering that most rebuilding teams plot out for their future stars. Robert hit .328/.376/.624 with 32 home runs, 92 RBI, 36 stolen bases, and 108 runs scored in 551 plate appearances this season between High-A Winston-Salem, Double-A Birmingham, and Triple-A Charlotte. The 22-year-old Cuban phenom will have a spot on the Opening Day roster next March if the White Sox want to get more serious about contending.\n\n24. Colorado Rockies\n\nRecord: 60-84\n\nLast Week: 24\n\nIt is stats-padding time for the Rockies hitters, as 12 of the team's final 18 games are at home in the thin air and spacious fair-territory surface area of Coors Field. Nolan Arenado will be going for 40 home runs -- he's at 37 now, and his career high is 42. Trevor Story has already achieved a second straight 30-plus-homer, 20-plus-steal campaign, but he can up both totals. Charlie Blackmon will be trying to reach 30 home runs (he's at 27) for the second time in his career. Blackmon, who turned 33 years old in July, has already topped 100 runs scored for the fourth consecutive season.\n\n25. Seattle Mariners\n\nRecord: 58-86\n\nLast Week: 25\n\nSeattle lost six straight games last week against the Cubs and Astros to fall to a season-high 38 games under the .500 mark. This team is 45-84 since holding the best record in baseball on April 11 at 13-2. One cool thing is that we will finally get to see outfield prospect Kyle Lewis do his thing at the MLB level over the final three weeks of the regular season. Lewis went 11th overall in the 2016 MLB Draft and ranked as a consensus top-100 prospect in 2017 before injuries derailed his rise through the Mariners' system. He hit .263/.342/.398 with 11 home runs and three stolen bases in 122 games this summer at Double-A Arkansas.\n\n26. Toronto Blue Jays\n\nRecord: 55-89\n\nLast Week: 26\n\nIn the midst of a 17-game run against contending teams -- 2 vs. ATL, 3 vs. HOU, 2 @ ATL, 4 @TB, 3 vs. BOS, 3 vs. NYY -- the Blue Jays so far are 2-9. They've lost seven straight entering Tuesday night's series opener versus the Red Sox. To point out one encouraging thing: Anthony Kay, acquired from the Mets in the Marcus Stroman trade, matched a Blue Jays franchise record with eight strikeouts in his MLB debut Saturday at Tampa Bay. Kay, 24, had a 2.96 ERA and 135 strikeouts in 133 2/3 innings this year in the minors and could be a much-needed building block on the pitching side for Toronto.\n\n27. Kansas City Royals\n\nRecord: 53-91\n\nLast Week: 28\n\nJorge Soler slugged his 41st home run of the season on Saturday as part of a 7-2 victory over the Marlins, extending his single-season franchise home run record. It was previously 38, held by Mike Moustakas. The Royals would go on to lose 9-0 in Sunday's series finale at Miami, but they've won six of their last eight games, taking advantage of a light recent schedule that, beyond the Marlins, has also included series against the Orioles and Tigers. Kansas City has provided the most offensive production of the bottom five teams this year, and that counts for something here at Rotoworld.\n\n28. Miami Marlins\n\nRecord: 51-92\n\nLast Week: 27\n\nThe Marlins fell 8-3 to the Brewers on Monday, after losing two of three to the Royals over the weekend, and are currently a season-high 41 games under .500. They haven't earned consecutive wins since taking two straight from Arizona back in late July. One positive: Sandy Alcantara worked nine scoreless frames in a 9-0 defeat of Kansas City on Sunday, becoming the first Marlins pitcher with two shutouts in his rookie season since Dontrelle Willis in 2003. Overall, though, it has been an up-and-down season for Alcantara, who has a 4.04 ERA, 1.32 WHIP, and 131/78 K/BB ratio in 171 2/3 innings.\n\n29. Baltimore Orioles\n\nRecord: 46-97\n\nLast Week: 29\n\nBaltimore got swept in a four-game weekend series against the Rangers and will carry a five-game losing streak into Tuesday night's series opener against the National League-leading Dodgers. The longest losing streak for the Orioles this year is 10 games. Chatter about a possible promotion for top infield prospect Ryan Mountcastle began back in April, but he never did get the call during the summer months and general manager Mike Elias confirmed on Saturday that it will not happen in 2019. Mountcastle, 22, slashed .312/.344/.527 with 25 home runs and 83 RBI in 127 games this season at Triple-A Norfolk.\n\n30. Detroit Tigers\n\nRecord: 42-100\n\nLast Week: 30\n\nThe Tigers have already made it to 100 losses with 20 games still to play. It's very likely that they will wind up with at least 110 losses, which would make this the second-losingest season in the 119-year history of the franchise. Matthew Boyd, probably the best offseason trade piece for Detroit, has surrendered 15 earned runs on 20 hits and six walks over his last 18 1/3 innings (three starts) and now owns a 4.57 ERA in 171 1/3 total innings this season. The 28-year-old lefty had a 3.94 season ERA back at the July 31 deadline, when the Astros, Padres, Twins, and Red Sox were reportedly showing interest.", "description": "Yordan Alvarez and the record-setting Astros again lead Drew Silva's weekly MLB Power Rankings.
