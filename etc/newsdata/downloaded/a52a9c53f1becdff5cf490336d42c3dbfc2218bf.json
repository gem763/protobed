Bradford DeLong and Konstantin Magin wrote in a paper on the bubble. The crash was equally swift and arbitrary. Between February 2000 and February 2002, the NASDAQ lost three-quarters of its value \u201cagain without substantial negative fundamental news,\u201d DeLong and Magin wrote. By late 2000, more than $5 trillion in wealth had been wiped out. This sudden rise and sudden collapse in asset prices\u2014without much change in information about the underlying assets\u2014is the very definition of a bubble.\n\nThe current situation is different, in at least two important ways.\n\nFirst, in the dot-com bubble, public investors got hosed. Today, it\u2019s public investors that are doing the hosing.\n\nDerek Thompson: The millennial urban lifestyle is about to get more expensive\n\nWhen the web browser Netscape went public on August 9, 1995\u2014the day many cite as the beginning of the dot-com bubble\u2014its stock skyrocketed from $28 to $75 in a matter of hours, even though the company wasn\u2019t profitable. In today\u2019s market, the opposite is happening: Unicorns with no positive earnings are getting slaughtered at the gates. WeWork\u2019s valuation fell more than 80 percent pre-IPO when investors balked at its mounting losses. Peloton, Lyft, and Uber have also struggled to persuade public markets to grade them on a curve; all saw their stock prices fall on the day of the public offering. Institutions and retail investors are refusing to fork over to unicorns the valuations that private investors were expecting.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a picture of public mania. It\u2019s a picture of public sobriety. In lieu of a mass mania, today\u2019s masses are diagnosing an acute fever among private investors. The biggest offender, in fact, in just one company\u2014Softbank, a major backer of Uber, Lyft, and WeWork.\n\nSecond, there is little sign of a crisis for firms whose main product is pure software.\n\nJudging from the news, you might think this has been a terrible year for technology companies. But tech IPOs have been strong for the past two years, \u201cas long as what you\u2019re buying is actually a real tech company,\u201d JP Morgan\u2019s chair of market and investment strategy, Michael Cembalest, wrote in an October 7 research note. By \u201creal tech,\u201d Cembalest was referring to companies whose principal product is software, rather than, say, WeWork, which is in truth a real-estate company caught wearing an Actual Tech Company costume before Halloween.\n\nYou might not have heard about these \u201creal tech\u201d companies\u2014like Zscaler, Anaplan, and Smartsheet\u2014because they mostly sell business-to-business software or cloud services. But all of them are trading more than 100 percent above their listed IPO price. The problematic firms, Cemablest wrote, are those that aren\u2019t pure tech. Either they sell hardware plus software (like the stationary-bike company Peloton) or they own a digital marketplace for humans to transact goods and services in the physical world, like Uber, Fiverr, and Lyft. All those companies are trading below their IPO price.", "description": "The unicorn massacre unfolding today might just be the exact opposite.", "authors": ["Derek Thompson", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX155JU/facebook.jpg?1571333507", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
