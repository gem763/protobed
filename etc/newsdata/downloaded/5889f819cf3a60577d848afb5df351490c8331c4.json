But the work must start here and now,\" he will say.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party has also pledged to improve bus services as both parties look for policies beyond Brexit that will help them pick up votes in what is expected to be a tight and unpredictable election.\n\nPolling firm Opinium said Labour gained 2 percentage points after its conference in Brighton last week, when it committed to a huge expansion of public spending, but the Conservatives still held a 12-point lead. Other polls have a much narrower gap between the two parties.", "description": "UK finance minister pledges infrastructure spending on roads, buses and broadband", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8S0W5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
