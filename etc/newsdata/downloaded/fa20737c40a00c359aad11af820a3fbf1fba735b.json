It gave Kurdish fighters along the border a chance to retreat deeper into northern Syria.\n\nDuring an impromptu press conference shortly after the announcement on Thursday, Mr Trump heaped praise on Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, even as Turkish officials cast doubt on the American claims of a meaningful ceasefire.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

He\u2019s a friend of mine and I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have a problem because, frankly, he is a hell of a leader and a tough man, a strong man,\u201d Mr Trump said. He had tweeted following Mr Pence\u2019s press conference to brag about taking \u201ca necessary, but somewhat unconventional, path\u201d.\n\nMr Pence had announced the 120-hour ceasefire to allow Kurdish forces to leave the area, and claimed that the military offensive would ultimately end after those Kurds had left.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

All military operations ... will be paused, and Operation Peace Spring will be halted entirely upon completion of the withdrawal,\u201d he added, referring to an acronym used to describe the People\u2019s Protection Units, the leading faction within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a largely Kurdish militia that has been an ally of the United States.\n\nHe continued, during an appearance alongside secretary of State Mike Pompeo: \u201cOnce that is completed, Turkey has agreed to a permanent ceasefire and the United States of America will work with Turkey \u2014 will work with nations around the world \u2014 to make sure peace and stability are the order of the day in this safe zone.\u201d\n\nThe deal represents a big political win for Mr Erdogan, staving off Congressional sanctions while getting the US to agree to a safe zone it has long wanted. He will probably exploit the sight of two top US officials coming to his capital to work out a deal to bolster his own credibility internationally.\n\nBut many questions remain and experts doubted the durability of the halt in violence. For one thing, it remained wholly unclear whether the SDF had agreed to the deal, or whether Moscow, which has emerged as the principal power broker in Syria, has acceded to it. A few days ago Russia brokered a deal between the Syria regime in Damascus and the SDF to allow uniformed army forces to take control of the border.\n\nShortly after the ceasefire was announced, SDF Chief Commander General Mazloum was quoted as saying that fighting was continuing in the region where it had been agreed that it would stop.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

That withdrawal has allowed Turkey to begin a military offensive in the region, imperilling US-backed Syrian Kurds who played an important role in fighting back against Isis.\n\nShortly after the ceasefire announcement, Turkish officials insisted that the sole purpose of the pause was to allow the Kurdish-led forces to leave their posts.\n\n\u201cWe will suspend the Peace Spring operation for 120 hours for the PKK/YPG to withdraw. This is not a ceasefire,\u201d said Turkish foreign minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu. \u201cA pause of Turkey\u2019s operation in Syria is not a ceasefire, ceasefire can only be declared between two legitimate parties.\u201d\n\nThe US president\u2019s decision to withdraw American forces from northern Syria led to bipartisan criticism in Washington, including denunciations from prominent supporters of Mr Trump\u2019s like the senator Lindsey Graham.\n\nAnd, as reports of the devastation of the Turkish attacks began to come in \u2014 including concerns that Isis prisoners held in captivity had escaped \u2014 a bipartisan vote in the House officially criticised Mr Trump\u2019s decision. That vote was carried by 354 votes to 60, with roughly two-thirds of Republicans in the House joining the Democratic majority. At least two Belgian Isis fighters are among those said to have escaped from Kurdish prisons, according to NBC News, and it is unclear how many more may have escaped.\n\nShortly after the ceasefire was announced by his vice president, Mr Trump claimed an unambiguous victory on the subject, even as it remained unclear what fate would befall the Kurds in northern Syria should they refuse to leave the region.\n\n\u201cThis deal could NEVER have been made three days ago. There needed to be some \u201ctough\u201d love in order to get it done. Great for everybody. Proud of all!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nIn a separate tweet, he said: \u201cThis is a great day for civilisation. I am proud of the United States for sticking by me in following a necessary, but somewhat unconventional, path. People have been trying to make this \u2018deal\u2019 for many years. Millions of lives will be saved. Congratulations to ALL!\u201d\n\nBut analysts said that Mr Trump\u2019s decisions on Syria were guided almost exclusively by domestic politics. Mr Danforth said: \u201cThe real question is how this will play in Washington and whether it will provide cover for blocking Congressional sanctions to make it look like a win and to mitigate the political fallout from Trump\u2019s original decision.\u201d", "description": "Turkey\u00a0agreed to a five-day cessation of hostilities on Thursday in its ongoing conflict against a Kurdish-led militia in Syria\u2019s northeast, despite lingering\u00a0questions\u00a0about whether the United States-brokered deal would be sustainable or receive\u00a0the blessing of Russia.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock", "Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/17/14/mike-pence-turkey-cease-fire.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
