Previously called Project Gemini, the app will arrive sometime later this year.\n\nNamed after the Italian Renaissance-style painting technique of applying water-based pigments to wet plaster, Adobe Fresco\u2019s main selling point is its Live Brushes, which mimic the way paint would mix and blend in real life. Adobe\u2019s chief product officer, Scott Belsky, writes that Live Brushes use Adobe Sensei, the company\u2019s AI platform, to recreate how oils and watercolors bloom and react with each other.\n\nThe app also lets artists draw with vector and raster brushes, combining the features of the Adobe Illustrator Draw and Photoshop Sketch iPad apps. It\u2019ll support Photoshop files across Creative Cloud, and exporting to PDF for editing in Illustrator. The UI and toolbar layout is also similar to Adobe\u2019s upcoming Photoshop for iPad app, which is also arriving this year. You\u2019ll be able to import your Photoshop brushes so you can draw and paint with the brushes you\u2019re used to.\n\nIf you want to try out Fresco before it\u2019s officially out, you can apply to be in the prerelease testing here.", "description": "Adobe\u2019s upcoming iPad drawing and painting app will be called Adobe Fresco, the company announced today on its blog.
