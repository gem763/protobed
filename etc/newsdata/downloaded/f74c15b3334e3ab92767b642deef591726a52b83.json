Here are five bad policies to worry about instead", "language": "en", "text": "It is a foregone conclusion that the 1,150-kilometre Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion (TMX) will be built. The expansion, which involves building a second pipe along the route of an existing line, will run from outside Edmonton across the Rockies and on to Burnaby, B.C., boosting Alberta\u2019s oil exports from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000.\n\nTMX is a done deal. Albertans will be somewhat mollified. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals will claim to be fulfilling an election promise and demonstrating his government\u2019s deep dedication to Albertans. The company has already announced that it has hired more than 2,000 employees since the end of September. Indigenous groups are reportedly eager to take on some ownership and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, scraping for green support, suggested the government\u2019s purchase of TMX has nothing to do with promoting the fossil fuel industry in Alberta. \u201cWe purchased it for a reason,\u201d he said last week, \u201cWe now see how it can help accelerate our clean energy transition by putting any revenues that we get from it into a transition to clean energy.\u201d\n\nAccording to Morneau, about $500 million a year in pipeline revenues will be pumped into clean energy, thus performing the miracle of turning a carbon-emitting fossil fuel pipeline into a carbon-reduction project. One has to wonder, though, where this money will come from.\n\nMorneau said the government will put \u201cany revenues that we get\u201d into green energy projects. But revenues are not profits. Before Ottawa has free cash from TMX to throw around, a lot of money will need to be allocated to paying back the government\u2019s massive investment in the project, including the $4.5 billion the Trudeau government paid for the existing pipeline and the estimated $10-billion cost of completing the expansion. It\u2019s hard to see how TMX will be throwing up $500 million a year in excess profits for the Liberals to splash around as green energy investments any time soon.\n\nBut since TMX was set to go before the election, Morneau said it will not be a bargaining chip as the Liberals negotiate with other parties to keep their minority government afloat. \u201cMy expectation is that we have much common ground between the other parties,\u201d said Morneau.\n\nIf TMX is off the table, what are the policies, programs and taxes that the Liberals and NDP (and maybe even the Conservatives) might agree on? Here are five hot chips on the bargaining table that appear to offer \u201ccommon ground\u201d for early adoption. The only common element is that each represents undesirable and harmful government intrusion in the economy.\n\nPharmacare: In one form or another, Canada is about to take a critical plunge into national drug price and supply management. The Liberal platform was cautious, promising only to \u201ctake the critical next steps\u201d to implement national universal pharmacare so that all Canadians have the drug coverage they need at an affordable price. The NDP wants a full national pharmacare plan in place ASAP. The bargaining over pharmacare will focus on how far the federal government should go into taking over the pricing and supply of pharmaceuticals.\n\nMedia fund: The Trudeau government has already committed to funding journalism and media companies. Mediacare represents a government reach into another market that flies in the face of free market and free media principles.\n\nTelecom fees: The Liberal platform promised to lower monthly cellphone bills by 25 per cent over two years \u201cby using the government\u2019s regulatory powers, saving an average middle-class family of four nearly $1,000 per year.\u201d That\u2019s a big number, one the Liberals did not account for in their fiscal plan because, obviously, it would have to be paid by the telecom companies. If there are, say, three million families of four in Canada, that\u2019s an annual cost of $3 billion.\n\nNetflix taxes: All parties seem to agree that international big-tech companies need to be taxed, through a sales tax or some form of revenue tax. The Liberal fiscal plan estimated revenue of $600 million a year from tech companies. If the new tech taxes are limited to collecting GST/HST on Facebook and the other giants, fine. But there are indications that new tech taxes will amount to a grab for more than sales taxes to generate cash to redistribute to Canadian companies.\n\nTaxes on wealthy: It is hardly worth mentioning that the first Liberal budget will take a run at raising taxes on higher-income Canadians. The Liberals promised to make sure \u201cthe wealthiest Canadians \u2026 pay a little bit more.\u201d The NDP has more explicit plans it is certain to insist on when the bargaining chips are down. Also part of the tax-the-rich agenda is the Liberal plan to impose a tax on foreign buyers of housing.\n\nSo while the TMX pipeline green light will be hailed as the Trudeau Liberals\u2019 willingness to compromise and at least get a part of the Alberta economy moving, the real indicators of the government\u2019s direction are still to come but were comprehensively outlined during the election.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: tcorcoran@nationalpost.com | Twitter: terencecorcoran", "description": "Each of these five hot chips on the bargaining table represents undesirable and harmful government intrusion in the economy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/peace-tower-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
