The pan-European STOXX 600 index dropped 0.2%.\n\nMSCI\u2019s All-Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, was down 0.1% on the day.\n\nIn Asia, MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.76%. Chinese shares fell 1.68%. Hong Kong shares slumped 1.23%.\n\nBrent crude oil, the international benchmark, fell 1.78% to $67.79 per barrel on Tuesday.

Tension between the two countries was already running high over Iran\u2019s suspected ambitions to assemble nuclear weapons. The strikes in Saudi Arabia are likely to raise regional tensions further.\n\nSPARE CAPACITY\n\n\u201cAlthough Saudi Arabia\u2019s spare capacity and U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserves could plug some of the lost output, where oil trades in the near term will be influenced by how long it takes for Saudi production to fully recover,\u201d said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM.\n\n\u201cIt is this concern over negative supply shocks amid geopolitical tensions which should keep oil prices buoyed in the short term.\u201d\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes slipped to 1.8223%. Euro zone government debt yields edged lower amid the geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the Saudi attack.\n\nThe dollar was flat against a basket of other currencies.\n\nThe Fed is expected to cut interest rates at a policy meeting ending on Wednesday, although disagreement exists among policymakers.\n\nTrump on Monday said on Twitter that the Fed should enact a \u201cbig interest rate drop, stimulus\u201d. However, historical precedent suggests the Fed is likely to cut the expected quarter of a point and go no further.\n\nFutures contracts tied to the Fed\u2019s policy rate imply a 64.9% chance the U.S. central bank will cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a point to a range of 1.75% to 2% on Wednesday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Men are reflected on an electronic board showing the Nikkei stock index outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan, March 25, 2019.
