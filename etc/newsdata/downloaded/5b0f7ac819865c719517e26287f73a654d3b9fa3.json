Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., blasting Trump for downplaying his actions, and vowing that Trump \u201cwill choke on this supposed nothing-burger.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat this shows is repeated, concerted, premeditated, criminal conduct,\u201d Blumenthal argued.\n\nKARL ROVE: PELOSI WAS FORCED TO PURSUE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\nThe House of Representatives moved forward on impeachment inquiry this week, though they have not held a formal vote on the matter. Democrats accuse President Trump of abusing his office by requesting that Ukraine investigate his potential 2020 election rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cWhat this shows, I think, is the kind of anger and even hatred of this president by his political opponents,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s blinded them to the degree that they think they can make something out of nothing and there\u2019s nothing here in this transcript that is impeachable.\"\n\nTrump's July conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky triggered a whistleblower complaint that touched off a political tempest in Washington, D.C. The complaint was released publicly Thursday, alleging Trump used the \"power of his office to solicit interference\" from Ukraine in the 2020 election -- and that White House officials subsequently tried to \"lock down\" records of that phone call.\n\nSome Democrats allege Trump implicitly sought a quid pro quo - by trying to trade U.S. military aid for dirt on Biden - but the White House has vigorously denied it.\n\nREAD THE COMPLAINT", "description": "Fox News contributor Bill Bennett said on Friday that while an impeachment of President Trump would have to be plausible and sound to the American people, the events surrounding the president\u2019s phone call with the president of Ukraine is not a valid reason.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/bennett.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
