Schumer (D-N.Y.) contended that Scalia fought to protect the interests of chief executives and the wealthy elite and opposed worker protections throughout his career, describing his nomination by President Trump as a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis guy shouldn't even make it for secretary of commerce, let alone secretary of labor, which is supposed to protect and defend the working people of America,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nRichard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, the country\u2019s largest labor union, called Scalia a \u201clifelong union-buster\u201d and said his nomination goes against Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to stand on the side of workers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insulting, it\u2019s dangerous, and workers are not going to forget it,\u201d Trumka said on a call with reporters Thursday morning.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Scalia argued that he has advocated for workers. He noted that during a stint as the Department of Labor\u2019s chief lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, he had advocated for poultry workers who were not getting paid for their time dressing in safety gear before work.\n\nHe also said he believed that labor unions were \u201camong the most effective advocates you will see for workplace safety and health\u201d and that it was \u201cfundamental\u201d that workers have the ability to choose whether to opt into a union.\n\nThe hearing also shone a spotlight on some of Scalia\u2019s past writings, including some op-eds he wrote as a student at the University of Virginia in the 1980s in which he said gay parents were \u201cin conflict with the traditional organization of society\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be treated \u201cas equally acceptable or desirable as the traditional family.\u201d\n\nIn response, Scalia noted how much time had passed since 1985 but eventually said he wouldn\u2019t make the same type of statements again and believed it was wrong for employers to terminate someone based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nTrump has hailed Scalia as \u201cone of the finest minds and lawyers in Washington\u201d who has \u201chad a fantastic career.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis father, as you know, was the great, great, great Supreme Court justice,\u201d the president told reporters last month. \u201cEven the people with not his views would say he was a great gentleman, a great man.\u201d\n\nAcosta\u2018s resignation in July came one day after he held a news conference at which he issued a defiant defense of his handling of the Epstein plea deal as a U.S. attorney in Florida years earlier. The deal allowed the financier to plead guilty to lesser offenses in a sex-crimes case involving underage girls.\n\nEpstein died of an apparent suicide in August.", "description": "Scalia is a partner at the Washington law firm Gibson Dunn, where he has represented companies such as Walmart, Ford, UPS and others in workers rights claims.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Eli Rosenberg", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kDqdwKUJkIcWuo-OHkebE8Fx8dA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VUJM5DXAM4I6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
