I would like to keep being there and keep having a presence there.\u201d\n\nThe criticisms of Wayne are in part based on a 1971 Playboy interview in which Wayne said that he believed in \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and defended the taking of the land that became America from the Native Americans.\n\n\u201cI believe in white supremacy,\u201d Wayne said during the interview. \u201cWe can\u2019t all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the Blacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them,\u201d Wayne added. \u201cOur so-called stealing of this country from them was a matter of survival. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s Interim Assistant Dean of Diversity and Inclusion Evan Hughes offered a vague statement to the student newspaper in response to the student protests.\n\n\u201cOur values as an inclusive community are predicated on the idea that our student population needs to be heard and have a say about our SCA environment, especially when information comes to light that changes how we relate to it,\u201d Hughes said in a short comment.", "description": "Film students at the University of Southern California are protesting against a campus exhibit dedicated to the life and films of John Wayne.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/JohnWaynecrop1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
