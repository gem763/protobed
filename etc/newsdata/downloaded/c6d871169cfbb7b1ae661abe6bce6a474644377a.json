Some Central European leaders have accused the outgoing Commission of unfairly focusing on the region when it comes to rule of law probes.\n\nOne of the officials said \u201cit is likely\u201d that Jourov\u00e1 would accept the post, but others warn that the new Commission's structure is still in flux.\n\nThe official suggested Jourov\u00e1 could be in line for the post because von der Leyen wants someone from a former communist country from Central and Eastern Europe in the job.\n\nThe EU has struggled to address what critics describe as democratic backsliding in some member states. The Article 7 process, the bloc\u2019s formal mechanism for dealing with rule-of-law challenges, which has been triggered against both Poland and Hungary, has stalled in both cases.\n\nThe new Commission democracy post would likely include responsibility for overseeing the development and implementation of a new annual rule-of-law review mechanism, which von der Leyen has pledged to support but which could face strong opposition from countries such as Hungary.\n\nIn her political guidelines, von der Leyen wrote that she stands by a proposal to link EU funding to rule of law criteria and intends to focus on \u201ctighter enforcement\u201d when it comes to rule-of-law breaches.\n\nAt the same time, if she becomes the formal candidate for the post, Jourov\u00e1 \u2014 who currently serves as commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality \u2014 could face scrutiny from MEPs due to her position as a member of the same political party as Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161. The prime minister has faced criticism at home, as well as a judicial probe, over alleged misuse of EU funds by his company Agrofert.\n\nNevertheless, in Brussels Jourov\u00e1 is perceived as largely independent of her prime minister when it comes to policy issues.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, Commission spokesperson Mina Andreeva, speaking on behalf of the transition team, said that \"nothing is decided until everything is decided.\"\n\n\"The puzzle can only be completed once all the pieces of the puzzle are there,\" she added.\n\nMa\u00efa de La Baume contributed reporting", "description": "Job would likely focus on rule of law, disinformation, election meddling and hate speech.", "authors": ["Lili Bayer"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1145514571-1200x628.jpg"}
