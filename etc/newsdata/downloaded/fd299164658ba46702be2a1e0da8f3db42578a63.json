I genuinely feel very deeply for the people who have had injustices done to them as a result of the failed police inquires - I really do,\" he said.\n\n\"I understand why they are angry and I understand why some of the anger is targeted at me.\n\n\"I don't want people to feel sorry for me, but I don't want people to question my motives either. I did my best, that's all you can do in life.\n\n\"I am genuinely very, very sorry that the inquires didn't go the way they did. I genuinely was trying to do the right thing.\"", "description": "Tom Watson has said he feels \"very deeply\" for those caught up in the failed police investigation into an alleged Westminster paedophile ring but insisted he was trying to do \"the right thing\".", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters", "Charles Moore"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212760255-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
