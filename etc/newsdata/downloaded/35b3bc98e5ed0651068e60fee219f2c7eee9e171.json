He has dismissed evidence, produced by the security agencies he supervises, of Russian interference in the 2016 American election\u2014a straightforward violation of U.S. sovereignty. More recently, according to a whistle-blower in the intelligence committee, he pushed Ukraine to intrude in the 2020 campaign on his behalf. On the very same day the president was at the UN defending the idea of sovereignty, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment investigation because, in the Ukraine case, Trump had done the exact opposite.\n\nFranklin Foer: Trump\u2019s classic bully move\n\nIn his deeds, rather than in his words, Trump is concerned only with internal sovereignty, which has to do with the question of who has the final legitimate authority within a state. And he is advancing a particularly self-serving version of that idea\u2014one in which he is the sovereign, free not so much from foreign interference, but from the internal institutions that exist to scrutinize and curb his executive power. This kind of sovereignty is an enemy of democracy, not its ally.\n\nTrump has never been shy about his contempt for the fact that his presidential powers are constrained by Congress and the courts. He bypassed the former whenever he could with executive orders and denigrated judges who ruled against his policies as politically motivated, in an attempt to undermine their legitimacy. He has sought to discredit the journalists who report on his administration, and has routinely described investigations of his connections with Russia as a witch hunt. On Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reported, Trump described \u201cthe person who gave the whistle-blower the information\u201d as \u201cclose to a spy.\u201d He went on to imply that informants should be swiftly punished: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nTrump isn\u2019t the only world leader who cites the principle of external sovereignty while trying to sweep away internal constraints. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson regularly makes appeals to sovereignty; it was one of his main arguments for why his country should leave the European Union. But as Johnson\u2019s unlawful attempt to suspend Parliament showed, what he really wanted was to be able to push Brexit forward unimpeded by parliamentary scrutiny.\n\nThe foreign strongmen whose ways Trump appears to admire\u2014authoritarians such as Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin\u2014rule their countries without pesky internal constraints. On the international stage, these regimes, too, insist upon the sanctity of their national sovereignty, which in their cases includes the power to have domestic opponents exiled, imprisoned, forcibly reeducated, or killed.", "description": "The president claimed at the UN that defending a country\u2019s sovereignty is the best way to defend its democracy. But his interpretation of sovereignty mostly aggrandizes himself.", "authors": ["Alexis Papazoglou", "Freelance Writer"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_1171027885/facebook.jpg?1569444894", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
