On the other hand, his aggressive tariffs have arguably slowed economic growth. The mounting uncertainty raises prices and discourages firms from making new investments. Slowing economic growth then reduces the odds of Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nThe Fed is thrust into an awkward position, Dudley writes. If it surrenders to Trump\u2019s bullying on interest rates, it becomes complicit in his anti-trade policies, particularly involving China. Worse, the Fed might inadvertently encourage \u201cthe president to escalate the trade war further, increasing the risk of a recession.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTo escape this dilemma, Dudley wants the Fed to denounce Trump. \u201cOfficials could state explicitly that the central bank won\u2019t bail out an administration that keeps making bad choices on trade policy, making it abundantly clear that Trump will own the consequences of his actions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhoa!\n\nWhat Dudley proposes would dramatically change the Fed\u2019s political role \u2014 shifting it from a nonpartisan and technocratic institution, deciding when and how much to ease or restrict money or credit, into an overtly political entity with its own political agenda. Trump is already pushing the Fed in that direction, and Dudley\u2019s plan would complete the journey.\n\nHis proposal would demolish the Fed\u2019s standard defense of its \u201cindependence\u201d: that it\u2019s necessary to achieve its congressional mandates of \u201cprice stability\u201d and \u201cmaximum employment.\u201d The Fed would become an all-purpose economic agency that inevitably would be driven by partisan politics.\n\nAD\n\nYou can imagine how long what\u2019s left of the Fed\u2019s \u201cindependence\u201d would last. About 10 seconds. Dudley recognizes this but argues it\u2019s inevitable.\n\n\u201cI understand and support Fed officials\u2019 desire to remain apolitical,\u201d he writes. But Trump\u2019s \u201congoing attacks on Powell and on the institution have made that untenable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe continues:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s even an argument that the election itself falls within the Fed\u2019s purview. After all, Trump\u2019s reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy, to the Fed\u2019s independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives. If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhoa!\n\nGiven the resulting controversy, Dudley published a second column (Sept. 4) backing away from what he clearly had advocated in the first. His proposal simply won\u2019t fly politically \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t. Elected officials surrender their explicit powers only when they\u2019re convinced that the loss of these powers makes them politically stronger. The logic is self-evident: Politicians are better off when unpopular decisions are shifted to somebody else. This certainly describes the Fed\u2019s \u201cindependence.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPoliticians and economists alike recognize that there are times when the government must adopt unpopular policies for the country\u2019s long-term welfare. In the Fed\u2019s case, this usually involves higher interest rates to preempt financial speculation or undesirable inflation. Few elected officials praise higher interest rates. Indeed, they are happy to criticize the Fed publicly for decisions that, privately, they support.\n\nAD\n\nDudley\u2019s call to arms is over the top. The Fed\u2019s vaunted \u201cindependence\u201d is a messy arrangement full of potential inconsistencies, ambiguities and failures. It\u2019s hard to describe as well as defend. Its main virtue seems to be that it\u2019s better than any likely alternative. The Fed\u2019s best survival strategy is to do what it has been doing along, which is to use its best judgment to fulfill its congressional mandates. Picking a fight it cannot win against Trump is simply asking for trouble.\n\nRead more from Robert Samuelson\u2019s archive.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump can\u2019t soothe markets by blaming his Fed chair\n\nCatherine Rampell: Trump has a dream team for mismanaging a recession\n\nFareed Zakaria: Trump is leading a global attack against central banks.
