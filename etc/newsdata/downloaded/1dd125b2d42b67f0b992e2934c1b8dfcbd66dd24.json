BRADLEY examines the likely impact of the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi", "language": "en", "text": "He may have been the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist and the supremo of global jihad, but Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was all but a mythical figure to those hunting him.\n\nKnown as \u2018The Invisible Sheikh\u2019 \u2013 by virtue of the mask he wore to address his commanders \u2013 he nurtured the lowest of profiles, eschewing the showmanship of fellow jihadi leaders who paid the price by making themselves vulnerable to tracking by intelligence services.\n\nIndeed, he made only two video appearances during his lifetime \u2013 until yesterday, that is, when US Special Forces apparently recorded him blowing himself up in northwestern Syria.\n\nFor five years, Al-Baghdadi \u2013 a nom de guerre, his real name was Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri \u2013 led the most barbaric terrorist outfit the modern world has known.\n\nCaliphate leader: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi detonated his own suicide vest during the targeted raid on his lair in Syria's Idlib province and killed three of his children in the blast\n\nHe came to global attention in 2014 when a YouTube video showed him in the pulpit of the Nouri mosque in Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city, which his IS foot- soldiers had just conquered.\n\nDressed in a black turban and flowing black gown, he delivered a sermon urging Muslims around the world to swear allegiance to the new caliphate \u2013 an Islamic state led by a caliph, a successor to the Prophet Muhammad who has absolute political and religious power \u2013 and to flock to protect its newly conquered territory.\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s Iraqi tribe claimed descent from the Prophet, but few had heard of him before he brazenly declared himself ruler of all Muslims.\n\nBorn in 1971 to a middle-class family in the Iraqi city of Samarra, Al-Baghdadi always saw his destiny as an important religious leader. As a youth he was a keen footballer, but known for his piety. His family nickname was \u2018the Believer\u2019 because he\u2019d scold those who failed to observe religious practices correctly.\n\nAbu Bakr Al-Baghdadi preaching during Friday prayer at a mosque in Mosul. Known as \u2018The Invisible Sheikh\u2019 \u2013 by virtue of the mask he wore to address his commanders\n\nHe moved to Baghdad to study, graduating in Koranic studies and then teaching at a mosque. But when the US invaded Iraq in 2003, he joined the violent insurrection. A year later, US forces arrested him in Fallujah, but he was considered a low-level threat and incarcerated for only ten months.\n\nCrucially, however, he spent time in the hellish Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca \u2013 known as the Jihad University \u2013 detention facilities where he befriended battle-hardened jihadis.\n\nFollowing his release, Al-Baghdadi joined the Iraqi branch of Al Qaeda which later became Islamic State of Iraq.\n\nIn 2010, he re-emerged as its leader, and his fighters crossed into Syria to take advantage of the chaos caused by the civil war. Islamic State in Iraq thus morphed into Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant \u2013 and ISIL (later IS) was born.\n\nBy 2015, this ruthless battlefield tactician was ruling over a caliphate spanning parts of Syria and Iraq that was the size of Britain, with almost 8 million people under his control, and an annual budget of more than $1billion \u2013 generated through the sale of oil from the facilities IS controlled, but also from extortion and kidnapping.\n\nHis fanatical militia, who flocked to the caliphate from all over the world, numbered at least 30,000, although some estimates put their number at the caliphate\u2019s peak as at least double or even treble that.\n\nDuring its reign of terror, IS carried out unspeakable acts of barbarity in the name of a perverted holy war. Its ultimate, apocalyptic goal was to rid the world of anyone \u2013 Muslim and non-Muslim alike \u2013 who refused to submit to its extremist interpretation of Islam.\n\nThousands of innocents were lined up on their knees and ritually slaughtered by having their throats slit. As \u2018infidels\u2019, Christians, Yazidis and Shia Muslims were singled out for slaughter, the ghastly spectacle was recorded in sickeningly\n\nprofessional propaganda videos that shocked the world.\n\nIS relished its reputation for brutality to Western hostages in particular, including Britons David Haines, an aid worker, and Alan Henning, a Salford taxi driver who had gone to Syria to help deliver aid. Countless others were burned or buried alive, or drowned, while suspected homosexuals were thrown from the top of buildings, and thousands of women and girls were taken as sex slaves.\n\nIn Iraq, more than 200 mass graves containing IS victims have been found containing between 6,000 and 12,000 bodies. Still more mass graves continue to be discovered in Syria.\n\nDonald Trump addressed the nation Sunday morning, confirming that the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 'died like a dog'\n\nAt the same time, IS terrorists have carried out dozens of attacks around the world, killing and maiming thousands.\n\nNo wonder Donald Trump was triumphant yesterday \u2013 \u2018he died like a dog\u2019 \u2013 as he announced Al-Baghdadi\u2019s death. There have been numerous false reports of his death since the defeat of IS in 2017, but the President has a particular reason to be thrilled.\n\nTrump is facing stinging criticism domestically and internationally that his partial withdrawal of US troops in Syria this month has left the Kurds \u2013 America\u2019s allies in the fight against IS \u2013 exposed and created a vacuum which might allow IS to re-emerge.\n\nThe group still has thousands of armed supporters in the area. IS sleeper cells have already launched several attacks.\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s death will bolster Trump\u2019s claim that under his watch IS will not be allowed to regain strength and threaten American interests. But the President would be foolish to be too optimistic. The parallels between the US raids that killed Al-Baghdadi and that which killed Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011 are striking \u2013 and ominous.\n\nMany terrorism experts argue that Al Qaeda is an even more dangerous enemy today, with thousands of battle-hardened members in South Asia, Africa and the West. Meanwhile, Islamic State is active in at least 18 countries, claiming to have carried out more than 1,800 attacks in the first half of this year alone. Al-Baghdadi is gone and the dream of the caliphate is over \u2013 but his death has not dealt a fatal blow.", "description": "JOHN R.
