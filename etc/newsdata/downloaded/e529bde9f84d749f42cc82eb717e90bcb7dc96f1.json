Along with other evidence, that has led to some of the world's most famous scientists including Carl Sagan speculating that the shadowy patches could be life.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star's mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star's core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow.

They found that it seemed to vary hugely: between 2006 and 2017, the amount of light being reflected back into space halved and then started rising again.\n\nThose changes had a similarly large effect on the amount of solar energy that the clouds absorbed, and therefore how much ciculation there was in the planet's atmosphere. Vigorous activity could be seen in the planet's atmosphere, with clouds that whirled at more than 200 miles per hour, and could be explained by those changes in the clouds.\n\nBut, adding to the mystery, scientists still don't know why those dramatic changes are happening.\n\n\u201cThat is a striking result,\u201d Limaye adds. \u201cIt suggests that something is changing. We can see the change in brightness. If the albedo is changing, something is driving those changes. The question is, what is the cause?\u201d\n\nThose dark patches that have been the subject of so much speculation have been referred to as \"unknown absorbers\", and could play some role in those changes.", "description": "Unexplained shapes seen on Venus, which some scientists have suggested could be signs of alien life, are even more mysterious than we thought.
