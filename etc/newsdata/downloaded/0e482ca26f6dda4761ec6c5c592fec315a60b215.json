But eating a lot of red and processed meat probably increases your risk of bowel (colorectal) cancer.\n\n\u201cIf you currently eat more than 90g (cooked weight) of red and processed meat a day, the Department of Health advises that you cut down to 70g, which is the average daily consumption in the UK.\u201d", "description": "Researchers have looked at the link between diet and erection length, and found that men who eat more red meat have shorter erections", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18798443.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/6_GettyImages-886051580.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
