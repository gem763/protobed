Isn't it weird when they're about to?\n\nYou pull and push and wiggle. You try all the tricks in the book!\n\nBut nothing will make that tooth budge! Why do we have these tiny teeth anyway?\n\nDifferent kinds of teeth\n\nachiichii/123RF\n\nYou have four different kinds of teeth:\n\nIncisors \u2014 the chisel-shaped teeth right up front. They\u2019re the ones you use when you take a big bite out of an apple!\n\nCanine \u2014 These are your pointy teeth beside your incisors. They\u2019re super useful for tearing food like meat!\n\nPremolars (Also called bicuspids !) \u2014 These teeth are strong and have ridges, and they are perfect for grinding and crushing up the food you eat.\n\nMolars \u2014 These are the toughest teeth! They have more ridges than your premolars. But you won\u2019t get them until you\u2019re six or even 12 years old!\n\nWhere do they come from?\n\narvebettum/123RF\n\nBefore you\u2019re born, there are tiny teeth starting to form in your jaw called tooth buds. But when you\u2019re born, those teeth can\u2019t be seen popping out of your gums yet!\n\nBaby teeth start to come in when you\u2019re between four and seven months old. You should have all 20 of your baby teeth by the time you are three!\n\nWhy do we have baby teeth?\n\nThere are four super important reasons why we have those pearly whites in our mouths:\n\nMake some room!\n\nRafael Ben-Ari/123RF\n\nOne of the most important reasons is that they keep a space ready for your adult teeth to grow into. If you lose a baby tooth too early, you might lose the space needed for your new tooth. That would make your adult teeth crooked!\n\nMmmm food!\n\nandersonrise/123RF\n\nYour baby teeth help you eat more than just mush by breaking food into easy-to-swallow pieces. So you can chomp down on yummy granola bars, tear and pull apart tough meats, and crunch on fruits and veggies!\n\nSay What?\n\nKatarzyna Bialasiewicz/123RF\n\nYour teeth help you speak! Your teeth, tongue and jaw help you say the words you use every day by controlling air flow out of the mouth. Your tongue hits your teeth or the roof of your mouth to help you make the different sounds that form words.\n\nCheeeese!\n\nCarline Bon-Ami/123RF\n\nOur teeth also help us smile! So open wide and show off those pearly whites!", "description": "Have you ever had a wiggly tooth that just won\u2019t come out?
