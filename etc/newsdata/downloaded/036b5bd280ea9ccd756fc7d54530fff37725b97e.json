I had just finished talking about the Catholic thinker Thomas Aquinas. My sin? According to my student, I had \u201cintellectualized\u201d Saint Thomas. I had described his philosophical sources and his historical context, but had said little about the philosopher\u2019s fundamental project\u2014one that had everything to do with the salvation of our souls.\n\nMy student\u2019s name, fittingly, was Tom. He was a believer at a secular liberal-arts school, and he was sick of being condescended to either by a campus lousy with self-congratulatory progressives or by teachers (like me, he assumed) who treated religious faith as an inert museum piece. \u201cWait,\u201d I told him. \u201cToday we talked historical context, and next time we\u2019ll illuminate religious practice.\u201d", "description": "Why police fail to catch sexual predators, Raj Chetty\u2019s American dream, the jailhouse true-crime writer, and Drew Gilpin Faust on Virginia and race.
