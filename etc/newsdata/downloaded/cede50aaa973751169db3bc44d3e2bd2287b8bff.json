Tweeting, talking, sexually harassing it \u2013 \u2018Siri, what are you wearing?\u2019\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Trump and his phone called the Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on Sunday and afterward, at 11pm, Trump announced the US would withdraw troops from northern Syria, leaving America\u2019s Kurdish allies alone to face Turkey.\n\n\u201cThis is a complete betrayal of the Kurdish fighters who helped the US defeat Isis,\u201d said Colbert, \u201cand there\u2019s only one way out of this: Kurds, you\u2019ve got 24 hours to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.\u201d\n\n'People are not machines': John Oliver examines China's one-child policy Read more\n\nThe move was roundly condemned across the aisle, even by Trump stalwarts Mitch McConnell and Fox and Friends host Brian Kilmeade.\n\nIn defending his actions, Trump \u201csaved the best for worst\u201d and went for his phone, with a tweet that can really only be quoted in full: \u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!).\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone full god-emperor,\u201d said Colbert, imitating the president: \u201cIt is I, Donald the Great, of unmatched wisdom and infinite wives, destroyer of casinos, conqueror of 10-piece McNuggets, scourge of Chrissy Teigen, defeated only once in battle by my eternal nemesis: umbrella.\u201d\n\nSeth Meyers on Trump: 'He basically just blew the whistle on himself' Read more\n\nMeanwhile, keeping up with the Ukraine scandal \u201cfeels like somebody is feeding me crazy pills\u201d, said Colbert. \u201cI mean, we have seen the transcript of the phone call where Trump pressures the president of Ukraine for dirt on Joe Biden, but everywhere you look, the Republicans are saying: there\u2019s nothing wrong with this call. You didn\u2019t see what you saw.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, over the weekend, a second whistleblower has reportedly started working with the first whistleblower\u2019s lawyer and preparing to testify. It\u2019s amazing, said Colbert \u2013 \u201cthey\u2019re really starting to build a case that the president did the thing he has repeatedly admitted.\u201d\n\nJimmy Kimmel\n\n\u201cBetween Trump and the Joker, it was a quite a weekend for villains in a lot of makeup,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel. Kimmel first addressed the emergence of a second whistleblower in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. Trump, who doesn\u2019t know their identity, dismissed them as a \u201cpartisan\u201d on Monday, which is \u201clike eating a steak and saying \u2018I can tell the chef is a Libra,\u2019\u201d joked Kimmel.\n\nSecond whistleblower aside, the impeachment saga continues to spiral for Trump. \u201cTo recap, we now have two whistleblowers, we have a transcript of the phone call, a bunch of highly incriminating text messages, and not only did Trump do it privately with Ukraine, he asked China to do it on television,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cIf this was Judge Judy, he\u2019d be out by the first mesothelioma commercial.\u201d\n\nTrump naturally defended himself on Twitter, but \u201cI think he may have swapped the Adderall for airplane glue this time\u201d, said Kimmel in reference to his tweet of \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom\u201d.\n\nIn other news, a federal judge rejected the president\u2019s claim that he is immune from criminal investigations \u2013 in this case, one into his tax returns \u2013 calling his defense \u201crepugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values\u201d.\n\nIt might not happen soon, \u201cbut I love the irony that we\u2019re gonna release Trump\u2019s tax returns without his consent\u201d, said Kimmel. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to grab them by the subpoena and see what happens.\u201d\n\nTrevor Noah\n\nWe\u2019re now weeks deep into the impeachment investigation engulfing Trump\u2019s presidency, and \u201cif you were facing the biggest crisis of your presidency, what would you do?\u201d asked Trevor Noah on the Daily Show. \u201cProbably lay low and focus on putting out this fire. But you see, you\u2019re not Donald Trump. Because if you were Donald Trump, you would start a whole new fire.\u201d\n\nThat new fire would be ordering US troops out of northern Syria, and it\u2019s a big deal, said Noah. American troops in Syria have been protecting Kurdish forces, key in the fight against Isis, from Turkey.\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) Trump\u2019s abrupt Syria withdrawal proves he\u2019s as reliable as Apple Care is for covering cracked screens. pic.twitter.com/hUeYTDEYza\n\n\u201cAfter a move like this, you can\u2019t blame America\u2019s allies for thinking America\u2019s word ain\u2019t shit,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWithout the Kurds, Isis could make a comeback \u2013 and not like a cool, small part in a Tarantino movie kinda way, not that kind of comeback.\u201d\n\nThe bipartisan dismay at this move has been striking, Noah noted. \u201cEven Mitch McConnell, Senate majority leader and Jack-o-lantern in December, has come out condemning Trump.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s devastating news for the blindsided Kurds, but Noah suggested a solution: \u201cKurdish forces, you need to phone Trump, and you need to tell him you have dirt on Joe Biden. But if he wants it he\u2019s going to need to give you military aid. Or as I like to call it, a Kurd pro quo.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts assess Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria and the emergence of a second whistleblower", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/08/Colbert_Impeach_Late_Night.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a080cae980b59842c3ca3ed9e18d4392", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
