Members were not adequately notified (about the military exemption) and as a result were unable to take appropriate action.\u201d\n\nFormer ADF members do receive some TPD cover through their defence entitlements.\n\n\u201cBut this is irrelevant to these cases because they have been paying QSuper for more than a decade,\u201d said Mr Price, who backs key findings in ASIC's review of TPD cover.\n\nQSuper is one of the nation\u2019s largest super funds with $110 billion under management and about 585,000 members.\n\n\"Our only motivation is to act in the best interest of members by paying legitimate claims as quickly as possible,\" a QSuper spokesman said. \"The military exclusion, which is clearly described, does not limit a member's eligibility to claim for injuries relating to other activity.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA fund spokesman said it would not comment on individual cases but claims it has one of the lowest dispute rates and second highest claims acceptance, at about 91 per cent compared with an industry average of 88 per cent.\n\nDenied on a technicality\n\nAnother veteran, who was a land mine specialist in Uruzgan, Afghanistan, claims he has been denied TPD cover on a technicality despite being placed on a full invalidity pension because of mental and physical injuries.\n\nThe veteran, who discussed his problems with AFR Weekend but asked not to be named, has had cover with QSuper since 2003 and alleges he was unaware that in 2016 injuries sustained during his military service were removed from the cover.\n\n\u201cHe was sent notification to an old address and no other information was supplied to him or any other members,\u201d Mr Price said. \u201cThey had his phone number but never sent a message or made calls to notify him of the changes.\"\n\nMr Price said QSuper\u2019s changes to TPD retraining clauses means that if was able to do another job \u201csuch as flip a burger at Macca's\u201d then he was ineligible for cover.\n\n\u201cTheir retaining clause is their get out of jail card,\u201d he said. \u201cYou only have to see what QSuper put Liam through to understand the problems. They made him see an 'independent specialist' who after only 40 minutes objected to all treatment and options recommended by six treating specialists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fund recently granted TPD cover to Mr Mulhall because it was decided that his injuries were caused from his work as a fireman and not from his time in the airforce.\n\nA spokesman for QSuper said: \u201cAs with other funds, our policies contain exclusions for injuries sustained through military activity. Every claim to QSuper is assessed according to an individual\u2019s circumstances and recognising its complexities. This assessment is medically rigorous and subject to both internal and external review.\"\n\nAccording to Taylor Blackburn, an insurance specialist with Finder, TPD within super is often cheaper and some funds will offer the cover automatically without requiring medical tests.\n\nBut the downside is having a claim allowed is usually tougher compared to a standalone policy and the definition of TPD can be broader, which could mean finding a job in work outside of your previous experience.\n\nAn Australian Securities and Investments Commission report published this week found life insurers are routinely selling \"junk\" TPD products through superannuation funds.\n\nIt singled out AMP, Asteron (formerly Suncorp Life) and Westpac, claiming they had higher-than-expected declined claim rates.
