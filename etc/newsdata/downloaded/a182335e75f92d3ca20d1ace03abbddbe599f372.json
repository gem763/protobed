The complainant met with the suspect and handed him R8 000 with the promise of settling the balance later that afternoon. The second meeting took place as agreed and the suspect was apprehended by the Hawks officers,\" Mulaudzi said.\n\nSupplemental sworn statements, which News24 has seen, show a WhatsApp conversation between the complainant and suspect in which they talk about cases pertaining to facilities management company Bosasa and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa .\n\nIn the chat, the suspect writes; \"I've spoken with the prosecutor from the NPA, he can sort things out from his side in terms of paperwork. He's waiting to hear from me on the way forward\".\n\nHe further writes and asks the complainant what he offered \"on the table\" as payment.\n\nThe suspect also writes that it would take \"R200K for both cases\" to go away.\n\n\"150K for Bosasa only. Very high profile case\" the suspect writes.\n\nArrested suspect in Hawks branded clothing (Supplied)\n\nREAD: Agrizzi, Mti, Gillingham among Hawks' Bosasa arrests\n\nThe suspect is expected to appear in the Alexandra Magistrate's Court on Thursday.\n\nMulaudzi said the suspect, who was arrested on Tuesday, was found wearing Hawks-branded clothing in Sandton.\n\nHe was also found to be in possession of fake South African Police Service, Hawks and National Prosecuting Authority documents as well as a false Hawks appointment certificate.\n\nNational head of the Hawks Lieutenant General Godfrey Lebeya has welcomed the arrest.\n\n\"I welcome the work of the team that was involved. The arrest has removed the threat posed by the suspect on the community. We encourage members of the public to continue to provide information on criminals.\"\n\nLebeya said the days of faking the Hawks' identities were over.\n\nLast week, the Hawks arrested former Bosasa chief operations officer Angelo Agrizzi and former correctional services commissioner Linda Mti on allegations of corruption related to the facilities management company.", "description": "A man posing as a Hawks official has been arrested for allegedly attempting to extort R200 000 from a person implicated in allegations of wrongdoing at the state capture inquiry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8511/229e31e51fc649869eb91d3c1924b9a6.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-02-14"}
