Both clubs had reportedly refused an offer to hold the match in Madrid.\n\nAnd Manchester City\u2019s Catalan manager Pep Guardiola, an outspoken campaigner for the independence movement, urged European intervention to ease the crisis.\n\n\u201cThe international community must help us to solve the conflict between Catalonia and Spain,\u201d he said. \u201cSome mediator from outside (must) help us sit (down) and talk.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s explosive decision has thrust the Catalan dispute to the heart of the political debate as Spain heads towards a fourth election in as many years, which will be held on November 10.", "description": "Barcelona (AFP) \u2013 Barcelona was bracing for fresh violence Saturday after nearly 200 people were hurt in a night of clashes with radical separatists", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/0bfae3_200-people-injured-in-catalonia-latest-night-violence-barcelona-violence-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
