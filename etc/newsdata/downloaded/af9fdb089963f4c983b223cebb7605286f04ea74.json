The Bowland Shale as a whole could be a very important resource for Lancashire and the UK and we plan to continue with our work to prove this,\" Cuadrilla Chief Executive Francis Egan said.", "description": "Cuadrilla to test second UK shale gas well in a few weeks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8T0LF_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
