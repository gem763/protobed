General Assembly in New York for failing to protect the environment, will lead a street protest in Montreal on Friday.\n\nCommercial flying accounts for 2.5 per cent of carbon emissions. With passenger numbers forecast to double to 8.2 billion by 2037, experts say emissions will rise if no action is taken.\n\nThe United States, which quit the Paris accord in 2017, backs the U.N.-negotiated CORSIA, which is supported by most airlines and would cap rising aviation emissions at 2020 levels through the purchase of carbon offsets.\n\nHowever, U.S. support is tied to other major aviation countries also backing the plan and a guarantee that CORSIA would prevent airlines from being subjected to separate and more costly carbon tax schemes by individual countries, a U.S. State Department official said.\n\nEurope, meanwhile, wants to keep its right to run separate emissions schemes.\n\n\u201cWe support CORSIA being a first step, a minimum at this stage,\u201d said Pascal Canfin, chair of the environment committee of the European Parliament.\n\n\u201cBut we believe our sovereignty allows us to be more ambitious if we wish to be so, and this is something that all ICAO members should respect,\u201d Canfin said.\n\nAllowing other offsetting programs would put a \u201cdouble charge\u201d on airlines and could weaken other countries\u2019 resolve to participate in CORSIA, de Juniac said.\n\nHe added that he did not believe Europe\u2019s actions would put U.S. resolve for the deal at risk.\n\nICAO cannot impose regulations but sets standards that are approved by its 193 member countries. The assembly runs from Sept. 24 through Oct. 4.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "Aviation leaders under pressure to do more after overall carbon emissions hit record highs last year", "authors": ["Allison Lampert"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/greta-thunberg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
