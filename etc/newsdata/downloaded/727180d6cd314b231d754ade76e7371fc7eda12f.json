It is still a bit too soon for all that on this evidence, but just when Manchester United appeared set to make a disappointing start to their Europa League campaign, one of the next generation found a way through.\n\nOn his ninth senior appearance and only his second start, the 17 years and 353 days old Mason Greenwood found a breakthrough \u2013 scoring his first goal for United 18 minutes from time \u2013 to rescue Ole Gunnar Solskjaer from what was almost an uninspiring goalless draw with Kazakhstani champions Astana.\n\nThe performance left much to be desired. Marcus Rashford \u2013 who burst onto the scene in this competition three years ago \u2013 was particularly wasteful in front of goal. But given this was United\u2019s youngest European starting line-up for seven years, Solskjaer will take the three points and put the rest down to experience.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Axel Tuanzebe was trusted at centre-half, while winger Tahith Chong and nimble playmaker Angel Gomes started for the first time. But it was Greenwood \u2013 the most promising talent among this current crop \u2013 who made the difference.\n\nFor a long periods, it was a case of new names but the same old problem. Despite the injection of youthful energy, United struggled once again to break down a low-lying, disciplined defence. Astana\u2019s only ambition was to leave Old Trafford with a point and a first half light on action ended goalless.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Fred, making his first start in 148 days, clipped the crossbar from 30 yards after only three minutes. Rashford, spurned United\u2019s best opportunity of the night when, following the breakdown of a corner, he fired straight into visiting goalkeeper Nenad Eric.\n\nThe first half\u2019s one moment of truly penetrative play resulted in Greenwood slipping past one defender, cutting in from the right and arcing the ball millimetres wide of the far post. It was the only time United broke through Astana\u2019s lines with any menace during those opening 45 minutes. It was also a sign of things to come.\n\nUnited continued to toil after the break, with Chong failing to convert at the far post after a devilish, low cross by the rarely-spotted Marcos Rojo. Gomes, at that point, was the most impressive of the young players. His cute turn and flick had created that opportunity and he was not intimidated by Astana\u2019s robust play despite his slight 5ft 5in frame.\n\nSolskjaer eventually sought more experience. Chong and Gomes were replaced by Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata. The breakthrough quickly followed, but it was all Greenwood\u2019s good work. Again, the teenager picked the ball up on the right, shifted inside and found space to shoot, this time through Eric\u2019s legs.\n\nIn doing so, he became the club\u2019s youngest-ever scorer in Europe, and kept alive the hope that for all the problems of the present, the future of Solskjaer\u2019s United is bright.", "description": "\u2018Solskjaer\u2019s Sprogs\u2019? \u2018Ole\u2019s Offspring\u2019?
