Esper and acting OMB Director Russell Vought \u2014 along with the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani have refused to comply with subpoena deadlines set by House Democrats on Tuesday.\n\nThe California Democrat slammed the administration\u2019s stonewalling, but said the committee will continue its work.\n\n\u201cThe case for obstruction of Congress continues to build,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even as that case of obstruction continues to build, we are nonetheless continuing to get good and important information from these courageous witnesses.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
