Leavitt is the Seminoles\u2019 quality control analyst. Kill is a special assistant to Tech coach Justin Fuente. And Woods is the senior adviser to Mack Brown at UNC.\n\n\u201cBeing a head coach, I realize that his position is a lonely one at times,\u201d said Woods, the former head man at South Carolina, Appalachian State and VMI. He said that former head coaches \u201csee (the big picture) more clearly than people who haven\u2019t done it.\u201d\n\nThe ACC schools seem to be following the lead of Nick Saban and Alabama. Among the dozen men listed as football analysts on the Tide\u2019s website are former Tennessee coach Butch Jones and ex-Houston coach Major Applewhite.\n\nAnd former Washington and Southern California head coach Steve Sarkisian spent the 2016 season as an analyst with the Crimson Tide before he was promoted to offensive coordinator for the national title-game loss to Clemson. After two seasons as the Atlanta Falcons\u2019 offensive coordinator, he is back in Tuscaloosa as a coordinator.\n\nFormer Georgia and Miami coach Mark Richt, now an ACC Network analyst, says he never added any ex-head coaches to his staff because he didn\u2019t want his existing assistants to worry about being replaced. But he added that the former coaches can \u201cbe good eyes and ears for the head coach\u201d and serve as trusted sounding boards for their bosses.\n\nBecause they are classified as non-coaching, sport-specific staff members under NCAA bylaw 11.7.3, they aren\u2019t allowed to directly coach the players during practices or participate in on-field activities. As a result, they don\u2019t count against the Bowl Subdivision limit of 10 assistant coaches and four graduate assistants.\n\nOn gameday, they are allowed to stand on the sideline, wear headsets and perform duties like tracking stats or managing the offense\u2019s play count. But they aren\u2019t allowed to offer any tactical adjustments.\n\n\u201cEven if you were a Hall of Fame-type of a coach at a previous school, once you\u2019ve accepted this non-coaching, sport-specific staff member role, your responsibilities naturally must change,\u201d said Kris Richardson, the NCAA\u2019s director of academic and membership affairs.\n\nAmong Woods\u2019 responsibilities at UNC are organizing the offseason camps and clinics, maintaining the program\u2019s relationship with the American Football Coaches Association and officials, and handling analytics during games, Brown said.\n\n\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t want to go out and recruit. Maybe they don\u2019t have the energy to recruit, but they come up to me and say, \u2018Here\u2019s what I saw in practice. Here\u2019s what I think needs to happen,\u2019\u201d Brown said. \u201cI go to Sparky every time and say, \u2018What does the book say to do? Does it say to go, does it say not to?\u2019 It\u2019s just the voice of experience.\u201d\n\nWoods came to North Carolina after spending four years as an assistant at Richmond. Kill _ who went 52-45 in eight seasons at Northern Illinois and Minnesota before retiring amid a lengthy fight with epilepsy _ stepped down as Southern Illinois\u2019 athletic director to take his current job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s addiction, like anything else,\u201d Kill said. \u201cYou try to get rid of it, but it\u2019s just very difficult.\u201d\n\nLeavitt went 95-57 from 1997-2009 while guiding South Florida from Division I-AA to a top-five ranking. He was coach Willie Taggart\u2019s defensive coordinator at Oregon in 2017 and remained in Eugene after Taggart took the Florida State job in 2018.\n\nAfter Leavitt parted ways with the Ducks this past February with a $2.5 million buyout, he became available and rejoined Taggart in September under a letter of agreement that pays him $80,000 and runs through next August.\n\nFlorida State certainly seems to be playing better with him around.\n\nThe Seminoles\u2019 defense gave up averages of 520 total yards and 40 points in the two games before Leavitt\u2019s arrival. Those numbers dropped significantly _ to 398 total yards and 22.7 points allowed per game _ with Florida State going 2-1 since his hiring.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s brought a lot of positive energy. His enthusiasm is contagious,\u201d Taggart said. \u201cYou come to meetings in the morning, you hear coach Leavitt\u2019s voice, \u2018Good morning. Ready to go to work.\u2019 It\u2019s just positive energy and it\u2019s contagious. Guys are feeding off of it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Aaron Beard in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and Hank Kurz Jr. in Virginia; and AP freelancer Bob Ferrante in Tallahassee, Florida, contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Some of the most experienced head coaches in the Atlantic Coast Conference aren\u2019t exactly coaches anymore.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joedy Mccreary"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/02/not_coaches_anymore_football_91572_c0-207-2911-1904_s1770x1032.jpg?00ada2f4d4746f1304c34f160874973b9f5ac6ae"}
