Kapler went 161-163 in two seasons.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Middleton has overruled his front office. After promising last fall to spend \u201cstupid\u201d money, he was the driving force behind the decision to give Bryce Harper a $330 million, 13-year contract. He also made the move to fire hitting coach John Mallee in August and replaced him with former manager Charlie Manuel.\n\n\u201cThe decision about a manager is much more directly connected to achieving the strategic objective of winning a World Series, just like signing Bryce Harper, (acquiring) J.T. Realmuto have a stronger impact on them,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cSo when you get to an impasse on those types of decisions, a CEO not only has the authority to step in, the CEO has the responsibility and obligation to step in.\u201d\n\nMiddleton conceded public opinion was a factor in his decision, but he pointed several times to the team\u2019s September collapses the past two seasons.\n\n\u201cYou have to know where your customers are and take their views into account,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I walked around the stadium and walked around the streets of Philadelphia and people come up to me, there were almost, if not as many people, in favor of keeping Gabe as there were telling me to make the decision I ultimately made. It wasn\u2019t as clear-cut as some people think it was.\u201d\n\nThe Phillies were 20-36 in two Septembers under Kapler. They were only two games behind in the NL wild-card standings after beating Atlanta on Sept. 18 this season but lost eight of the next nine, including a five-game sweep at Washington. They finished eight games behind Milwaukee for the second wild card and 16 behind the first-place Braves in the NL East.\n\nLast year, the Phillies had a one-game lead in the division on Aug. 11 before going 15-31 the rest of the way.\n\n\u201cI kept bumping up against the September collapses,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cUltimately, I felt if I were to bring Gabe back, I had to feel very confident we would have a different outcome in 2020.\u201d\n\nKlentak maintained his support for Kapler but didn\u2019t undercut his boss.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a secret, I\u2019m a big fan,\u201d he said of Kapler. \u201cI think he\u2019s really good at what he does, very talented, very hardworking, a good communicator. I also understand why we are where we are. Wins matter. September baseball matters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot written and said about power struggles. Was it John\u2019s process? Of course it was. But it was very collaborative. This was not John going above everybody\u2019s head and coming in with an iron fist. This was as collaborative as can be and I understand it.\u201d\n\nKapler had one year remaining on his contract. Before the season, Middleton extended Klentak\u2019s contract through 2022 and MacPhail\u2019s through 2021. He insisted he remains confident in them despite calling the shots on several important decisions.\n\n\u201cThis is what CEO\u2019s do,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have a need for a CEO if everybody in the organization made every decision correctly every time. Why do you think there is a CEO? We are paid to make big decisions. We get paid to ensure our organization meets its strategic objectives. Big decisions are exactly where CEO\u2019s have to be. Those are decisions that make a difference and that\u2019s I get paid to figure out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think I actually bring value to an organization, that I\u2019m not a potted plant sitting in the corner.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "John Middleton runs the show in Philadelphia.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Maaddi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/phillies_kapler_fired_baseball_93056_c0-228-5472-3420_s1200x700.jpg?f89739662670662341638fe34403095f75f3e118", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
