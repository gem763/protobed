But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed to her that she didn't belong at Yale in the first place,\" the now-deleted tweet read.\n\nThe Times deleted the tweet once they began receiving flak for what was said.\n\nWhat are they thinking at the New York Times? 1) It's a discredited allegation. 2) If it had happened, such things are 'harmless fun'? pic.twitter.com/zBUmj0Ghqq \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) September 15, 2019\n\nThings that are never as much fun as they seem like they\u2019re going to be:\n\n- Vegas\n\n- the Super Bowl\n\n- having a penis thrust in your face\n\n- wait, what?\n\n- tweeting pic.twitter.com/MG54V5Aj2t \u2014 Sam Baker (@sam_baker) September 15, 2019\n\nThis headline was written by the lone person in the country that thinks having a penis thrust in your face at a party is harmless fun. pic.twitter.com/mujLmkBTHy \u2014 Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) September 15, 2019\n\nWhen the Times' public relations department decided to \"clarify\" what happened, they apologized for the tweet and said they would investigate.\n\nAlso, a tweet that went out from the @NYTOpinion account yesterday was clearly inappropriate and offensive. We apologize for it and are reviewing the decision-making with those involved. \u2014 NYTimes Communications (@NYTimesPR) September 15, 2019\n\nAccording to POLITICO, one of the book's co-authors, Robin Pogrebin, drafted and sent the now-deleted tweet.\n\nAccording to a Times insider familiar with the matter, Pogrebin wrote the offensive tweet, which should have been vetted before it was posted. \u201cIt was really neglectful,\u201d the insider said of the paper\u2019s overall handling. \u201cThere were serious errors made along the way.\u201d The Times\u2019s PR team also responded to questions about why a piece featuring new reporting about a controversial, national issue didn\u2019t run as a news story, but rather a \u201cnews analysis.\u201d The Sunday Review section, the Times said, \u201cfrequently runs excerpts of books produced by Times reporters.\u201d\n\nThe new accuser, Max Stier, is a Democratic attorney and someone who has had a long and contentious history with Kavanaugh.\n\nFrom Mollie Hemingway at The Federalist (emphasis mine):\n\nThe only supposedly new claim made in the book isn\u2019t new and comes from Democrat attorney Max Stier, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s with whom he has a long and contentious history. In the words of the Yale Daily News, they were \u201cpitted\u201d against each other during the Whitewater investigation in the 1990s when Kavanaugh worked for Independent Counsel Ken Starr. Stier defended President Bill Clinton, whose legal troubles began when a woman accused him of exposing himself to her in hotel room she had been brought to. Clinton later settled with the woman for $850,000 and, due to a contempt of court citation for misleading testimony, ended up losing his law license for five years. Stier worked closely with David Kendall, who went on to defend Hillary Clinton against allegations of illegally handling classified information. Kavanaugh\u2019s reference to his opponents being motivated by \u201crevenge on behalf of the Clintons\u201d met with befuddlement by liberal media, despite the surprisingly large number of Clinton-affiliated attorneys who kept popping up during his confirmation hearings. In any case, Stier\u2019s claim, which even two Democratic senators\u2019 offices didn\u2019t find particularly worthwhile, was that he had seen an inebriated Kavanaugh, pants-down, at a freshman-year party. Stier\u2019s claim to the staffers, we\u2019re told, was that other people at the party put Kavanaugh\u2019s genitalia into the hands of a classmate. Another unnamed person alleged said that he or she might have remembered hearing that the female student had transferred out of her college because of Kavanaugh, \u201cthough exactly why was unclear.\u201d The reporters, who describe Democrats in glowing terms and Republicans otherwise, say that Stier is a \u201crespected thought leader\u201d in the defense of the federal bureaucracy. They don\u2019t mention his history of working for the Clintons. As for the victim? They say she \u201chas refused to discuss the incident, though several of her friends said she does not recall it.\u201d To repeat: Several of her friends said she does not recall it.\n\nPogrebin retweeted New Yorker reporter Jane Mayer, who defended Stier, his resume and him being a credible witness:\n\nAnd Max Stier is no slouch of a witness- he is a Rhodes Scholar, Stanford Law grad, fmr. Supreme Court Clerk, runs a bipartisan center for public service and is the star of Michael Lewis\u2019 last book. https://t.co/UZYKtUNBEQ \u2014 Jane Mayer (@JaneMayerNYer) September 15, 2019\n\nBut she didn't retweet the corrected info on Stier:\n\nEvidently Max Stier was in Kavanaugh\u2019s class at Yale, clerked for Justice David Souter but isn\u2019t a Rhodes Scholar, so correcting and updating. \u2014 Jane Mayer (@JaneMayerNYer) September 15, 2019\n\nTalk about a clear indication that the authors had a smear campaign against Kavanaugh, despite them saying they tried to \"put themselves in his shoes.\"", "description": "Bombshell..09/16/2019 19:12:05PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/274/2cc545d0-d4ce-4755-9c02-54c6a7fb91b4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
