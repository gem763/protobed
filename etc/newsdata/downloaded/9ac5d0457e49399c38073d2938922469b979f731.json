If companies are not thriving on Wall Street, the market replaces them with better companies that are performing.\n\n\u201cWhat the US does is create new companies and that\u2019s a profound difference compared to other developed markets,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cI like that element. It shows that it\u2019s good at recycling capital.\"\n\nInvestors \"are more demanding\u201d, Mr Buckland said. \u201cThe US is my momentum trade.\"\n\nBritain, on the other hand, is his value trade. \u201cI think that the Brexit risk premium offers opportunities. In the UK, if a company trades on a low multiple for a period of time, something will happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in other cheap markets, such as Japan, nothing will happen.\u201d", "description": "Citi\u2019s global head of equity strategy says that demanding shareholders ensure cheap US and UK stocks don't stay cheap.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.58%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_46%2C$y_83/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0f829f6f45908c3489d5b53832c02049cec96a3d", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
