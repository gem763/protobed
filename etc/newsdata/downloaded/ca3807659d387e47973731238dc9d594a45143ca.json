What\u2019s next? Does this mean he\u2019s going to throw Israel under the bus if he threw the Kurds under the bus?\u2019\u201d a longtime friend of the president said. Another evangelical Trump ally told the president he was offended by a comment the president made about Kurdish fighters having \u201cplenty of sand to play with,\u201d according to a person briefed on the conversation.\n\nIt\u2019s a first for Trump\u2019s presidency: The same evangelical leaders who\u2019ve been notoriously unmovable through prior controversies have spoken out forcefully to condemn his policy toward Syria. Televangelist Pat Robertson said Trump was \u201cin danger of losing the mandate of heaven.\u201d Family Research Council head Tony Perkins described the move as \u201cinconsistent with what the president has done\u201d previously.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee shake hands with then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. | Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI was concerned about it, but feel more confident after talking with POTUS and seeing the results of the cease-fire and the economic sanctions,\u201d former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who initially blasted Trump\u2019s decision to ditch the Kurds as a \u201chuge mistake,\u201d wrote in an email to POLITICO on Tuesday. (In remarks from the White House Diplomatic Reception Room less than 24 hours later, Trump announced he would be lifting those same economic sanctions against Turkey \u2014 remarks that came a day after the U.S. special envoy for Syria engagement told a Senate panel the Turkish military offensive had killed hundreds of Kurdish fighters.)\n\nThe outrage over Trump\u2019s Syria decision, combined with the growing threat of impeachment, has left the president facing a new test in his relationship with white evangelicals as signs of tensions have begun to surface in recent polls. For some, his culturally conservative agenda may not be enough to keep them from walking away if the situation in Syria deteriorates further.\n\nIt\u2019s a dilemma that has left Trump\u2019s biggest religious boosters asking themselves whether his sky-high support with so-called values voters will last through next November.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s going to win in 2020,\u201d said the longtime Trump friend, \u201che has to be north of the 81 percent [of white evangelicals] he won in 2016. I\u2019m not suggesting that the polling is all of a sudden going to show that his support is plummeting because of Syria. But if it stays stagnant, he\u2019s a one-term president.\u201d\n\nWhite evangelicals have long grappled with a president they consider their greatest champion since the Reagan years, but who rarely approaches policy matters or discourse with their preferred tone or moral code. They have asked Trump not to curse at his campaign rallies, despite standing by him when he was caught on tape making vulgar comments about women in 2016. They have endorsed his hard-line immigration policies, but privately urged him to ditch the harsh language about immigrants and refugees. And they have consistently cited his appointment of anti-abortion judges as a hallmark of his presidency without mentioning the uncomfortable moment when, as a candidate, he suggested punishing women who choose to end their pregnancies.\n\nNow, the president\u2019s evangelical allies are pressing him to consider the consequences of pulling troops from Syria, which he has cast as a financially sensible decision. And they are warning him of trouble ahead if he doesn\u2019t \u2014 both in the region, where U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters have been killed by Turkish airstrikes in recent days, and with his political standing back home.\n\n\u201cThis is a danger zone for this administration when it comes to evangelicals. They see religious persecution, Iran gaining a foothold, Israel facing threats and the possibility of ISIS reemerging, and what Trump keeps talking about is the land, and the money, and the deal-making,\u201d said the longtime Trump friend. \u201cThe moral compass is missing, and he\u2019s off balance here with evangelicals.\u201d\n\nUnlike other voting blocs that have slowly moved away from Trump, white evangelicals have displayed a certain level of elasticity in their support for him \u2014 opting to adapt to the worst moments and elements of his presidency, even when they have shown initial signs of shock.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a blue-chip stock for evangelicals and they\u2019re cashed in fully. If there\u2019s fluctuation in the market, they always ride it out,\u201d said the Trump pal.\n\nIt\u2019s an enduring mystery of the Trump era and one that prompts questions about tribalism and the state of both major political parties. Do white evangelicals stand by Trump because there is no suitable Republican or Democratic alternative? Or do they embrace him because that\u2019s what they\u2019ve seen the most prominent among them do?\n\n\u201cMy gut says white evangelicals will jump when and if Fox News does,\u201d said Elesha Coffman, a scholar of American religion at Baylor University. \u201cAny movement, if we see it, isn\u2019t going to come from within their religious communities.\u201d\n\nA lengthy study released this week by the Public Religion Research Institute offers other clues about the current state of Trump\u2019s relationship with white evangelical voters, as well as why it could change between now and Election Day. In striking terms, the survey captures just how substantial the president\u2019s support is among white evangelicals: 99 percent of GOP-leaning white evangelical Protestants oppose impeaching and removing Trump from office and 63 percent say he has done nothing to damage the dignity of the presidency, separating them from majorities across all other major religious groups that said he has.\n\nOther figures raise questions about the durability of white evangelicals\u2019 support for Trump, particularly given the precarious position he finds himself in with Syria.\n\nFor example, 63 percent of white evangelical Protestants in the PRRI study said terrorism is a major concern for them \u2014 more than immigration (55 percent), which has been Trump\u2019s single biggest issue, or health care (53 percent). Those figures come amid warnings that the U.S. pullout from Syria could rekindle terrorism in Europe and cause a resurgence of the Islamic State. Already, a separate NPR/Marist survey found that nearly 30% of white evangelicals believe U.S. security has been weakened by Trump.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

That happened gradually during the Watergate era, when rank-and-file evangelicals slowly walked away from President Richard M. Nixon.\n\nAfter the Syria cease-fire, \u201cwill things get much worse? Will we get pictures of children who get victimized by chemical weapons? Will there be enough of a rebuke from Republicans or more voices inside white evangelicalism speaking out about this?\u201d Coffman asked, adding that \u201cit\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see movement then, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it.\u201d\n\nThere is also the shadow that impeachment has cast over Trump\u2019s presidency, and how white evangelicals are responding.\n\nA much-discussed Fox News poll found that nearly three in 10 white evangelicals want the president impeached and removed from office \u2014 a figure that startled some officials on Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, according to an outside adviser. And in the NPR/Marist survey, which was taken after House Democrats began their impeachment inquiry, only 62 percent of white evangelicals said they definitely plan to vote for Trump next fall.\n\nThat\u2019s the number Trump\u2019s top evangelical supporters are closely monitoring and cautioning the president not to ignore. Eighty-one percent of the white evangelical vote in 2016 was enough to carry him to the White House, they say, but with underwater approval ratings among other key constituencies he needs to do even better next fall.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7b/91/575a1a2f43c2ad6b4e4f4215a3df/191023-trump-pat-robertson-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
