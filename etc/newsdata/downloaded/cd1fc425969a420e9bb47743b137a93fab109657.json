He allowed Danny Santana\u2019s two-run homer in a 21-pitch first. At the end of the inning Yankees manager Aaron Boone, pitching coach Larry Rothschild and head athletic trainer Steve Donahue conferred in the dugout, and Ben Heller relieved in the second.\n\n\u201cJust when I was warming up, felt a little bit of tightness there, a little discomfort,\u201d Paxton said. \u201cI think I could have kept going, but they wanted to play it safe and have me completely rested for what comes next.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s plans for the Division Series against Minnesota include a rotation with Paxton, Masahiro Tanaka and Luis Severino, scheduled to make his third start Saturday after recovering from a lat injury that had sidelined him since spring training.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that,\u201d Boone said when asked where Paxton slot in. \u201cI would expect him to kind of prepare depending on when we slot him, have his normal sides and everything, and I don\u2019t think this will really alter that too much.\u201d\n\nCatcher Gary S\u00e1nchez returned after missing 10 games with left groin tightness. S\u00e1nchez struck out in all three plate appearances and came out after five innings, as planned.\n\n\u201cI feel good, healthy,\u201d Sanchez said through a translator. \u201cI feel like I was able to block, move around, have the flexibility I wanted. It felt good.\u201d\n\nNew York held off on slugger Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n\u2019s return from a left oblique injury. Boone said the concern was a tweak of the injury that could sideline the 36-year-old for the playoffs, and Encarnaci\u00f3n missed his 12th straight game.\n\n\u201cHe hit before again on the field really good, but I just think mentally he\u2019s probably not quite over that hump where he needs to be,\u201d Boone said. \u201cIdeally, we\u2019d love to get some at-bats this weekend, but it\u2019s not the most important thing.\u201d\n\nGiancarlo Stanton, Cameron Maybin, Brett Gardner, Gio Urshela, Mike Ford and Austin Romine homered in the opener of the final series in the Rangers\u2018 25-year-old ballpark. The Yankees lost out on home-field advantage throughout the AL playoffs to Houston, but raised their major league record total to 305, two more than Minnesota.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely keeping track,\u201d said DJ LeMahieu, who hit a three-run double that skipped past Willie Calhoun in left field to raise his RBIs total to 102, his first time in triple figures.\n\nStanton, limited to nine games before coming back from the injured list on Sept. 18, was 3 for 3 with two walks and three RBIs, and is 7 for 21 with two homers in seven games since his return.\n\nFord had a career-best four RBIs, and Gardner extended his career best with his 28th homer.\n\n\u201cIf you miss over the middle of the plate, they\u2019re going to do damage,\u201d Rangers manager Chris Woodward said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re really good at hitting mistakes off the barrel.\u201d\n\nFive relievers followed Paxton with a scoreless inning apiece, and Stephen Tarpley (1-0) got his first big league win.\n\nMichael King, a 24-year-old right-hander making his major league debut, was the only New York pitcher to get more than three outs. He allowed an unearned run on his error in two innings.\n\nRookie Joe Palumbo (0-3) allowed three homers and struck out seven in three-plus innings as the Rangers lost for the 10th time in 12 games.\n\nSLUMP ENDS, ANOTHER DOESN\u2019T\n\nUrshela, who missed Wednesday\u2019s game in Tampa Bay after he was hit on his left hand by a pitch in the road trip opener, singled in the fourth inning to end an 0-for-19 slide. Luke Voit was 0 for 5 with three strikeouts, extending his slump to 1 for 30.\n\nLONG-BALL BUNCHES\n\nThe six homers by the Yankees were the 34th time this season that a team has hit at least that many. That equals the combined total of the seasons with the second and third most instances (18 in 2003, 16 in 2017).\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSeverino (1-0, 0.00 ERA) has thrown nine scoreless innings in two starts since returning. He got his win in his second start, striking out nine in five innings against Toronto in New York\u2019s final regular-season home game. Texas will go with reliever Luke Farrell (1-0, 2.38) as an opener.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "While injuries have been a pain in the rear for the Yankees, they're hopeful a tight muscle in James Paxton's buttocks won't be an issue in the playoffs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/yankees_rangers_baseball_55755_c0-233-4144-2649_s1770x1032.jpg?fa8621a229a8d59d30824a15ab7e8ac81d545bf1", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
