It\u2019s now possible to buy a fully capable gaming rig that\u2019s less than an inch thick and weighs under five pounds. The Asus Chimera G703GI is not one of those laptops. It\u2019s a 10-pound monster with a 17-inch screen and a frame that\u2019s twice as thick as Razer\u2019s new Blade or the MSI GS65.\n\nThe Chimera feels like a relic of a bygone age when the only way to get a capable gaming laptop was to put up with a lot of weight and giant proportions. But it\u2019s not alone. There are still a lot of 17-inch gaming laptops available at a variety of price points. The Chimera is at the top of the pile, and it has a deep bench of specs and a sky-high price tag to match.\n\nBut if it isn\u2019t portable or upgradeable, then what\u2019s the point?\n\nOur review of Asus Chimera G703GI Verge Score 7.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Top-of-the-line performance\n\nImpressive cooling system\n\nBuild quality Bad Stuff Expensive\n\nGaudy design\n\nLimited upgradability Buy for $4,999.00 from Amazon\n\nIt\u2019s established that the Chimera is the definition of overkill. It has the performance of a desktop without the option to upgrade the GPU or CPU; only RAM and storage can be swapped.\n\nIt comes in two versions: a $3,499 model with a Core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a 1TB HDD, or the one I\u2019ve been testing, which costs $4,999 and ups the ante with a Core i9 processor, 64GB of RAM, and three 512GB SSDs. Both models have top-of-the-line Nvidia GTX 1080 graphics cards and two massive power bricks that have to be plugged in at all times.\n\nAsus Chimera G703GI specs Intel Core i9-8950HK (up to 4.8GHz)\n\n17.3-inch 144Hz full HD screen, with G-Sync and 3ms response time\n\n64GB 2666MHz RAM\n\nThree 512GB M.2 PCIe SSDs (reads up to 8700MB/s)\n\nNvidia GeForce GTX 1080 with 8GB memory (with 1974 MHz overclock boost)\n\nWindows 10 Pro\n\n3 USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports, 1 USB-C Thunderbolt 3, mini Displayport, 1 HDMI 2.0, and SD card slot\n\nTwo 280W power adapters\n\nWeighs 10.4 pounds\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of specs, but it\u2019s not very different from what you can get in a desktop PC for a lot less money. You can also upgrade your PC more often than you can a laptop, even though this laptop will probably never leave the desk it\u2019s placed on.\n\nThere are still advantages to having a 17-inch laptop. Compared to more portable gaming laptops, the major thing the Chimera brings is its Core i9 processor and 17.3-inch screen; no Max Q laptop on the market has either spec available.\n\nNot only do you get additional screen real estate (and you still have that fast 144Hz refresh rate gamers crave), but there\u2019s more room in the chassis for efficient cooling to keep internal parts safe and running longer.\n\nIts gargantuan frame gives it presence\n\nThe sheer footprint of it on a desk also means sitting down in front of the Chimera feels like you\u2019re at the center of a complete gaming workstation. Furthermore, you have such a high level of processing power that it just can\u2019t be squeezed into a laptop that weighs half as much with power requirements for more than only one charging brick (instead of two) for power to function.\n\nYou can use the Chimera with up to eight Xbox controllers\n\nAnother advantage of a 17-inch laptop is the room to squeeze in other features, like an Xbox Wireless controller receiver. The dedicated Xbox button brings up the Windows Game Bar and Xbox app so you can wirelessly connect up to eight Xbox controllers.\n\nOn the flip side, a 17-inch laptop doesn\u2019t provide more ports or an exceptionally better keyboard or screen than a smaller laptop. The Chimera can output at 4K or 2K resolutions for up to three monitors, but so can the Razer Blade 15 and a handful of other laptops.\n\nWith a spec sheet like the Asus Chimera\u2019s, there should be no doubt that it could handle any creative or resource-intensive task you throw at it. Sound mixing is possible with the dedicated mic and audio ports. There\u2019s also an SD card slot, so it\u2019s great as a batch editing workstation for Photoshop or Lightroom. But gaming is where the Chimera does its best work.\n\nIn Rainbow Six: Siege, the Chimera handled the game at ultra settings with supersampling, but still maintained 150 fps in lively multiplayer battles. Games like Fortnite, League of Legends, Destiny 2, and Monster Hunter: World will run at ultra settings at around 100 fps. Max Q gaming laptops like the Razer Blade 15 can hit triple digits and reach the 144 fps target as well, but not as consistently as the Chimera can.\n\nIt cuts through all games like butter\n\nAll of the processor-intensive applications the Chimera easily runs require a lot of cooling, especially with a Core i9 with turbo speeds up to 4.8GHz. You can use three fan modes (silent, balanced, and fan overboost), which are great for controlling the rush of air from the fans that you\u2019ll hear when it does heavy lifting.\n\nSilent mode does an excellent job of keeping the Chimera suitable for work in an office, for example, but it still gets loud when you\u2019re running games or multiple monitors.\n\nComfortable keys, thanks to a massive chassis\n\nThe Chimera doesn\u2019t have a mechanical keyboard, which is a disappointing omission from a machine this extravagant. Instead, the full-size keyboard has fully backlit RGB keys with 2.5mm travel, but they\u2019re still comfortable and they have the tactile feedback I like when typing long documents or rapidly hitting your QWERTY keys in a League game. Asus has the vertical height to use this kind of keyboard, which is another advantage gained by having a roomy 17-inch chassis.\n\nA nonslip grip texture runs across the palm rest, making it prone to oily fingerprints but comfortable to the touch when used for long sessions. The precision touchpad tracks smoothly enough to easily navigate between browser tabs or doing some light photo editing.\n\nOne interesting placement on the Chimera is the speakers, which are inside the lid right underneath the screen. The loud and bass-rich speakers are better than a smaller laptop\u2019s, including the Razer Blade 15. It doesn\u2019t suffer from distortion at loud volumes, so you can use them for playing games alone in a room or entertaining a few people with music. They\u2019re not detail-oriented like headphones or external speakers, but they are some of the best laptop speakers.\n\nAs for the Chimera\u2019s battery, it\u2019s really just a formality to call this behemoth a laptop. It lasts just long enough for you to find the two 280-watt chargers that are needed to power it.\n\nThe Chimera is the pinnacle of 17-inch laptops\n\nIn the end, the 17-inch laptop has become a canvas for the extreme in today\u2019s market. Of those laptops, the Asus Chimera G703GI is the most boastful and excessive machine you could possibly spend $4,999 on. But it also raises a fine point for those of you who don\u2019t have room for a full desktop setup, monitor, keyboard, PC case, and more. The Chimera can become that all-in-one solution with power similar to that of a desktop\u2019s.\n\nOf course, having tons of available power doesn\u2019t excuse the inconvenience of having to carry around a 10-pound laptop with two chargers, but the Asus Chimera proves there are still perks to having a desktop replacement in 2018.", "description": "There are some advantages to a 17-inch laptop.
