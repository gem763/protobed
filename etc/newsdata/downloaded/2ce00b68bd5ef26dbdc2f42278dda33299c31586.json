If the amendment is approved by parliament, Johnson\u2019s deal would not then be put to a vote on Saturday. The government would then seek to hold a vote on the deal on Tuesday, officials said.\n\n\u201cMy aim is to ensure that Boris\u2019s deal succeeds,\u201d said Letwin, kicked out of the Conservative Party for refusing to back Johnson\u2019s plans to leave the EU with or without a deal.\n\nBut Letwin wanted \u201can insurance policy which prevents the UK from crashing out on 31 October by mistake if something goes wrong during the passage of the implementing legislation\u201d.\n\nOutside parliament, many Britons say they are bored with the whole Brexit argument and just want the process to end. But others demonstrating on Saturday remain angry that Britain is leaving the EU and want that reversed.\n\nHannah Barton, 56, a cider maker from Derbyshire in central England, was draped in the EU flag. \u201cI am incensed that we are not being listened to,\u201d she said.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks at the House of Commons as parliament discusses Brexit, sitting on a Saturday for the first time since the 1982 Falklands War, in London, Britain, October 19, 2019, in this screen grab taken from video. Parliament TV via REUTERS\n\n\u201cWe feel that we are voiceless. This is a national disaster waiting to happen and it is going to destroy the economy.\u201d\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, backed a second referendum.\n\n\u201cVoting for a deal today won\u2019t end Brexit. It won\u2019t deliver certainty and the people should have the final say,\u201d Corbyn told parliament.\n\nBrexit \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d tops a frenetic week which saw Johnson confound his opponents by clinching a new Brexit deal.\n\nIn a divided parliament where he has no majority, Johnson must win the support of 320 lawmakers to pass his deal.\n\nIf he wins, Johnson will go down in history as the leader who delivered a Brexit - for good or bad - that pulls the United Kingdom far out of the EU\u2019s orbit.\n\n\u2018DO OR DIE\u2019\n\nShould he fail, Johnson will face the humiliation of Brexit unravelling after repeatedly promising that he would get it done - \u201cdo or die\u201d - by Oct. 31.\n\nJohnson won the top job by staking his career on getting Brexit done by the latest deadline of Oct. 31 after his predecessor, Theresa May, was forced to delay the departure date. Parliament rejected her deal three times, by margins of between 58 and 230 votes earlier this year.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nHe said lawmakers faced the option of either approving the deal or propelling the United Kingdom to a disorderly no-deal exit that could divide the West, hurt global growth and bring renewed violence to Northern Ireland.\n\nTo win, Johnson must persuade enough Brexit-supporting rebels in both his Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party to back his deal. His Northern Irish allies and the three main opposition parties oppose it.\n\nIn a boost for Johnson, some influential hardline Brexit supporters such as Mark Francois and Iain Duncan Smith said they would support the deal.\n\nSteve Baker, the head of a hardline Brexit faction in the Conservative Party, has told his European Research Group allies they should vote for Johnson\u2019s deal.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson appealed to lawmakers to back his last-minute Brexit deal in an extraordinary sitting of the British parliament on Saturday after his plans were plunged into chaos by his opponents' moves to derail the legislation.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442619301&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I077", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
