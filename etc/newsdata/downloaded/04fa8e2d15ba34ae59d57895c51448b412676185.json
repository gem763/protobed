For instance, Bendigo Bank, a competing financier to small-to-medium enterprises which has been around for 161 years to Greensill Capital's eight, is only capitalised at $5.35 billion on 2018-19 operating income of $1.5 billion and net profit of $376 million.\n\nBut it can't compete with the global reach of Greensill, which claimed $220 billion of finance had been extended to more than 8 million suppliers across 165 countries so far in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, Culture Amp, which measures and aims to enhance employee engagement at its corporate clients, raised $120 million at a $1.04 billion valuation in a raise led by Sequoia China in September. But its 2017-18 financials are a reality check.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe business made $17.9 million in revenue (including $15.7 million sales revenue) but lost $17.8 million after tax, with employee expenses alone ballooning to $23 million from $12.7 million the previous year.\n\nFollowing the September 2019 fundraising, Culture Amp founder Didier Elzinga told The Australian Financial Review that revenue was tracking towards $US100 million ($146 million) in the next 18 to 24 months. He said that the company had between 3 million and 5 million users across 2500 companies, and employed around 400 people.\n\nMr Elzinga preferred not to comment on the just-lodged 2017-18 financials on Monday, saying they were \"from a while back and we're not thinking in that period\".\n\nHe did not comment on whether revenues had since surpassed losses, a feat which WeWork had still not achieved by 2018 as it headed towards listing.\n\nAnother Culture Amp investor, Blackbird Ventures partner Rick Baker, told The Australian Financial Review that earnings were simply not a concern for venture capital investors in the way they were for many sharemarket investors.\n\nIn speaking about Canva, another scale-up investee company with global ambitions which had recently achieved a big valuation ($4.7 billion in its case), Mr Baker said \"they're not at a stage where their peers are profitable, and I don't want them to be profitable ... that's for years ahead when growth has slowed to 30 or 40 per cent and they're listed.\"", "description": "SoftBank's Vision Fund has thrown fuel on the fire of debate around the valuations of technology companies, after the backer of troubled WeWork invested $961 million into Australia's Greensill Capital at a valuation of almost $6 billion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5082%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_765%2C$y_219/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e331c0e19dbdcf26f0c07ed85fa83061387938bf", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
