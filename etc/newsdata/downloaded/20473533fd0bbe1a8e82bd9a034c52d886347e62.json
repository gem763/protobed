He begged his teammates to help him learn the language, and it worked.\n\n\u201cI was the happiest man in baseball,\u201d Mr. Rivera said.\n\nMr. Rivera is Major League Baseball\u2019s career leader in saves, compiling 652 during his career with the Yankees from 1995 to 2013.\n\nMr. Rivera was the first player elected unanimously to the Baseball Hall of Fame. He entered the hall as the class of 2019, his first year of eligibility.\n\nMr. Trump retraced Mr. Rivera\u2019s rise from humble roots in Panama, where he played as a kid with a cardboard glove, a bat made of tree branch and ball of rock, string and tape.\n\nMr. Rivera\u2019s coach asked him to pitch in a pinch one day, and he blanked the opposing team.\n\n\u201cA legend was starting,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Rivera began his major-league career as a starting pitcher before transitioning to a reliever role and solidifying his legend as a closer.\n\nMr. Trump recounted highlights from his career, from stiff-arming the Boston Red Sox in the 2003 American League Championship Series to pitching the final innings in the old Yankee Stadium, making it \u201cthe house that [Babe] Ruth built and Rivera closed out.\u201d\n\nMr. Rivera is also a philanthropist whose Mariana Rivera Foundation, a nonprofit, helps poorer kids in Panama and the U.S. He\u2019s also built a community center and a church in New Rochelle, New York.\n\nMr. Trump has awarded the Medal of Freedom to a string of famous ex-athletes in recent weeks, including NBA greats Bob Cousy and Jerry West.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
