Breed, File A Yolo! brand CBD oil vape cartridge sits alongside a vape pen on a biohazard bag.\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Some of the people rushing to emergency rooms thought the CBD vape they inhaled would help like a gentle medicine. Others puffed it for fun.\n\nWhat the vapors delivered instead was a jolt of synthetic marijuana, and with it an intense high of hallucinations and even seizures.\n\nMore than 50 people around Salt Lake City had been poisoned by the time the outbreak ended early last year, most by a vape called Yolo! \u2014 the acronym for \u201cyou only live once.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, hundreds of vape users have developed mysterious lung illnesses, and more than 30 have died. Yolo was different. Users knew immediately something was wrong.\n\nWho was responsible for Yolo? Public health officials and criminal investigators couldn\u2019t figure that out. Just as it seemed to appear from nowhere, Yolo faded away with little trace.\n\nAs part of an investigation into the illegal spiking of CBD vapes that are not supposed to have any psychoactive effect at all, The Associated Press sought to understand the story behind Yolo.\n\nThe trail led to a Southern California beach town and an entrepreneur whose vaping habit prompted a career change that took her from Hollywood parties to federal court in Manhattan.\n\nWhen Janell Thompson moved from Utah to the San Diego area in 2010, the roommate she found online also vaped. Thompson had a background in financial services and the two decided to turn their shared interest into a business, founding an e-cigarette company called Hookahzz.\n\nThere were early successes. Thompson and her partner handed out Hookahzz products at an Emmy Awards pre-party, and their CBD vapes were included in Oscar nominee gift bags in 2014. In a video shot at a trade show, an industry insider described the two women as \u201cthe divas of CBD.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Hookahzz was among the first companies to sell vapes that delivered CBD, as the cannabis extract cannabidiol is known. Now a popular ingredient in products from skin creams to gummy bears, cannabidiol was at that time little known and illegal in some states.\n\nThe partners started other brands that offered CBD capsules and edibles, as well as products for pets. Part of Thompson\u2019s pitch was that CBD helped treat her dog\u2019s tumors.\n\nBy autumn 2017, Thompson and her partner formed another company, Mathco Health Corporation. Within a few months, Yolo spiked with synthetic marijuana \u2014 commonly known as K2 or spice \u2014 began appearing on store shelves around Salt Lake City.\n\nSynthetic marijuana is manmade and can be manufactured for a fraction of the price of CBD, which is typically extracted from industrial hemp that must be farmed.\n\nSamples tested at Utah labs showed Yolo contained a synthetic marijuana blamed for at least 11 deaths in Europe \u2014 and no CBD at all.\n\nAuthorities believed that some people sought out Yolo because they wanted to get high, while others unwittingly ingested a dangerous drug. What authorities didn\u2019t understand was its source.\n\nInvestigators with Utah\u2019s State Bureau of Investigation visited vape stores that sold Yolo, but nobody would talk. The packaging provided no contact information.\n\nBy May 2018, the case was cold. But it was not dead.\n\nThat summer, a former Mathco bookkeeper who was preparing to file a workplace retaliation complaint began collecting evidence of what she viewed as bad business practices.\n\nDuring her research, Tatianna Gustafson saw online pictures showing that Yolo was the main culprit in the Utah poisonings, according to the complaint she filed against Mathco with California\u2019s Department of Industrial Relations.\n\nGustafson wrote that while at Mathco she was concerned about how Yolo was produced, that it was excluded from Mathco\u2019s promotional material and that the \u201clabels had no ingredients or contact listing.\u201d\n\nJustin Davis, another former Mathco employee, told AP that \u201cthe profit margins were larger\u201d for Yolo than other products.\n\nGustafson\u2019s complaint asserted that Mathco or JK Wholesale, another of the companies that Thompson and her partner incorporated, mixed and distributed Yolo. Financial records in the complaint show Thompson\u2019s initials as the main salesperson for Yolo transactions, including with a company in Utah. The records also show Yolo was sold in at least six other states, including to an address in South Carolina where a college student said he vaped a cartridge that sent him into a coma.\n\nThe former bookkeeper also tipped the Utah Poison Control Center about who she believed was behind Yolo, according to her complaint.\n\nBarbara Crouch, the poison center\u2019s executive director, recalled getting a tip in late 2018 and passing it along to the State Bureau of Investigation. SBI agent Christopher Elsholz talked to the tipster, who told him she believed the company she had worked for distributed Yolo. Elsholz said the company was in California and therefore out of his jurisdiction, so he passed the tip to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nThe DEA offered to help but took no law enforcement action, spokeswoman Mary Brandenberger said. Spiked CBD is a low priority for an agency dealing with bigger problems such as the opioid epidemic, which has killed tens of thousands of people.\n\nIn the end, it wasn\u2019t the synthetic marijuana compound in Yolo from Utah that caught up with Thompson. It was another kind of synthetic added to different brands.\n\nBy the time of the Utah poisonings, vapes labeled as Black Magic and Black Diamond had sickened more than 40 people in North Carolina, including high school students and military service members. Investigators were able to connect Thompson to that outbreak in part based on a guilty plea from the distributor of the spiked vapes, who said a woman that authorities identified as Thompson supplied the liquid that went into them.\n\nProsecutors also linked her to dealers charged in New York, where she pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy to distribute synthetic marijuana and a money laundering charge. The only brand federal prosecutors cited was Yolo.\n\nU.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman called Thompson a \u201cdrug trafficker\u201d who used JK Wholesale to distribute \u201cmassive quantities\u201d of synthetic marijuana as far back as 2014. She faces up to 40 years in prison.\n\nReached by phone the week before she pleaded guilty, Thompson declined to discuss Yolo and then hung up. In a subsequent text message, Thompson said not to call her and referred questions to her lawyer, who did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhile Yolo was Thompson\u2019s project and she was the exclusive salesperson, her business partner and former roommate was involved in its production, according to the workplace retaliation complaint.\n\nThompson\u2019s business partner and former roommate, Katarina Maloney, distanced herself from Thompson and Yolo during an August interview at Mathco\u2019s headquarters in Carlsbad, California. Maloney has not been charged in the federal investigation.\n\n\u201cTo tell you the truth, that was my business partner,\u201d Maloney said of Yolo. She said Thompson was no longer her partner and she didn\u2019t want to discuss it.\n\nIn a follow-up email, Maloney asserted the Yolo in Utah \u201cwas not purchased from us,\u201d without elaborating.\n\n\u201cMathco Health Corporation or any of its subsidiary companies do not engage in the manufacture or sale of illegal products,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhen products leave our facility, they are 100% compliant with all laws.\u201d\n\nMaloney also said all products are lab tested. She did not respond to requests for Yolo lab results.", "description": "Public health officials and criminal investigators traced \u2018Yolo!\u2019 to an entrepreneur whose vaping habit took her from Hollywood to federal court.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT731_CBDYol_ZG_20191021151657.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
