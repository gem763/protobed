But today\u2019s football? It\u2019s a lot different. A lot of guys can\u2019t take that. A lot of guys don\u2019t want to be called out. They want to fight, they want to be traded. That\u2019s pretty much where we\u2019re going with this game. You can see the rule changes and everything, it\u2019s just different.\u201d\n\nThe 35-year-old veteran said he was unsure whether the culture in today\u2019s league was good or bad but he \u201cknows what worked\u201d when he entered the league with the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nLOS ANGELES CHARGERS' MELVIN GORDON STANDS TO LOSE MORE THAN $2 MILLION DUE TO HOLDOUT\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good thing.
