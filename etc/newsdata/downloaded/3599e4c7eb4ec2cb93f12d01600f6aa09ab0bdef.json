One teacher told a U.S.-born student to go back to their country. Nooses have been hung from trees at one school\u2019s entrance, and Ku Klux Klan members have visited campuses.\n\nLoudoun County is one of the most affluent places in the country, home to high-caliber schools in the D.C. suburbs. But for some, it is also a place where school leaders ignore racist acts, fostering a \u201cgrowing sense of despair,\u201d according to a report commissioned by Loudoun County Public Schools that examines equity across a school system that has rapidly grown and diversified in the past decade.\n\n[Student exam scores in Virginia spark concerns about gaps]\n\nThe experiences of students of color in the Northern Virginia school system were culled from focus groups and interviews with several hundred students, teachers and staff at two dozen schools conducted by the Equity Collaborative, a national consulting firm.\n\nThe company concluded that school system employees have a \u201clow level of racial consciousness and racial literacy\u201d and that people were fearful and unsure of how to talk about race.\n\nThe perception that spewing hurtful words has few or no repercussions forces students into a \u201chostile learning environment,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn August, Superintendent Eric Williams issued a statement condemning white supremacy and other forms of hate, apparently heeding the first of four primary recommendations in the report.\n\n\u201cWhen students and staff experience racial insults, slurs, and/or other hate speech, we lack the positive culture and climate that supports students\u2019 growth,\u201d Williams said in the statement, adding that the school system \u201crejects racist and other hateful behavior and language, recognizing that it encourages discrimination, hatred, oppression, and violence.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Williams said he commissioned the assessment because of concerns over equity, including opportunity gaps for students, a desire to build a more diverse workforce and instances in which students were subjected to \u201cracial insults or slurs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe report\u2019s disturbing, and it\u2019s really sad,\u201d the superintendent said. \u201cWe can and we should and we must do better.\u201d\n\nThe system, which educates nearly 84,000 students, hired a director of equity this school year and has added more teachers at schools with large populations of English-language learners or students from low-income families.\n\nSchool board members, teachers, parents and community organizations have formed a committee to examine equity issues and will review the school system\u2019s policies on nondiscrimination and student discipline, said Brenda Sheridan, a school board member who chairs the Committee on Equity.\n\nSheridan represents the Sterling District in Loudoun, an area that includes the county\u2019s most economically disadvantaged campuses. She has long believed that the school system should address socioeconomic inequities in Loudoun, the wealthiest county in the nation, she said, but was surprised to learn about the racial issues affecting schools.\n\n\u201cWe have a really huge race problem in our school system \u2014 how we talk about race and how our students talk to each other,\u201d Sheridan said. \u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of things that create our biases, and we have to be aware of them so we don\u2019t put them on others, so that we can be impartial when we talk to our students.\u201d\n\nThe attention to equity in Loudoun is unfolding during a period of significant growth in the county, which has prompted the opening of campuses in recent years.\n\nThe school system has also diversified significantly in the past decade \u2014 white students make up 46 percent of enrollment, a drop from 63 percent in the 2008-2009 school year. Asian students are 23 percent of Loudoun\u2019s school population, Hispanic students 18 percent, black students 7 percent, and 6 percent are multiracial, school system data show.\n\nThe report also illustrated disparities in achievement among student racial groups and those who are English-language learners or who have disabilities \u2014 gaps that have persisted in school districts throughout the country.\n\nOther school systems in the Washington region, which boasts some of the highest performing public schools in the country, have also made tackling inequities a priority.\n\nFairfax County Public Schools, the largest school district in Virginia and among the biggest in the country, has added positions dedicated to equity at each school. School leaders in Montgomery County, Md., launched an online report card this year that assesses how well schools are preparing \u201cstudents who have not experienced the same level of access, opportunity or success as other students.\u201d\n\n[Maryland school system rolls out report cards showing disparity in achievement]\n\nLeaders with the Loudoun NAACP have pressured the school system in recent years to address persistent issues faced by students of color, including the underrepresentation of African American students in advanced classes and at the Academies of Loudoun, a $125 million specialty school that opened in 2018.\n\nThe inquiry into equity in Loudoun was conducted in the spring, a couple of months after an outcry over a game in which elementary school students simulated moving through the Underground Railroad . School officials apologized for an exercise that trivialized slavery.\n\nThat incident, among others, led the school system to take action, Williams said.\n\nStudents shared several instances of racism they experienced, which were cited anonymously in the report, including:\n\n\u201cKids are always getting on me about my skin color and my hair. They . . . call me the N-word and my teacher just turns the other cheek.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was something in a book about Arabs and the teacher said \u2014 All Arabs are terrorists. I raised my hand and said \u2018I am Arab and I am not a terrorist.\u2019 She just stared at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of my teachers told me to go back to my country. I was in shock. I was born here.\u201d\n\nSome educators said they do not feel the need to discuss race; one said they \u201cdon\u2019t see color.\u201d\n\nAnother said, \u201cI really don\u2019t have a lot of time to do that work and I also teach high level classes, so I don\u2019t have those kids,\u201d according to the report.\n\nOther educators said it is not clear what support is available to students and families who are victimized. One person said teachers of color fear retaliation for reporting an incident or raising concerns about how a situation is handled.\n\nRead more:\n\nDiverse Virginia school district makes push for more teachers of color\n\nVirginia\u2019s population growth is most robust in Washington suburbs\n\nTo fight hate and stereotypes, students and parents turn to textbooks\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "A report found students of color in Loudoun County face racist slurs and insults.", "authors": ["Debbie Truong", "Reporter Covering Virginia Schools", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7CPXVkcwy2aEqLii8J1VCfZACu4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ABPC7FWQXMI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
