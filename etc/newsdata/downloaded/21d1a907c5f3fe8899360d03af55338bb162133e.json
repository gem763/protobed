But his lawyers say prorogation is a normal part of the political process in which the courts cannot get involved.\n\nThe Court of Session in Edinburgh has ruled the suspension to be illegal but the High Court in London disagrees. The Supreme Court will give a final ruling.\n\nWhat is the Supreme Court?\n\nIt is the highest court in the United Kingdom. The judges, known as justices, have the final say on the biggest legal issues and are the ultimate check and balance on the UK's laws and constitution.\n\nThe justices only hear the cases that raise what they consider to be a genuinely important point about how the UK's laws should be interpreted and applied - that is about one in three cases referred to it.\n\nIt sits opposite the Houses of Parliament, its location symbolising the relationship between the two: Parliament makes the laws and the Supreme Court oversees their fair and just use.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Gina Miller had a Supreme Court victory over the government about the Brexit process in 2017\n\nCan the Supreme Court strike down laws?\n\nOnly Parliament can pass or cancel laws. The Supreme Court's role is to decide on the correct interpretation of those laws when there is a dispute. If the justices think a law conflicts with human rights safeguards, it can tell Parliament it should reconsider the legislation.\n\nCould the Supreme Court rule against the government on suspending Parliament?\n\nThe question for the Supreme Court is twofold.\n\nFirst, do judges have the power to intervene in how a prime minister prorogues Parliament?\n\nAnd, if they do, was Edinburgh's court right to conclude Mr Johnson had acted unlawfully in closing it for such a long period?\n\nEleven of the Supreme Court justices - the largest possible panel - will hear legal arguments from the English and Scottish court cases. The government's lawyers will then respond.\n\nThe hearing is scheduled to last until Thursday. The only comparable case of this importance took three days. That was Gina Miller\u2019s challenge as to whether the prime minister or Parliament should trigger Article 50 to start the process for leaving the EU\n\nOn a simple level, the justices have to decide whether or not the prime minister acted lawfully. If Mr Johnson loses, the question then would be what kind of action the court orders.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIf the judges rule that prorogation was legal, Parliament will remain shut until 14 October - unless the government advises the Queen to recall MPs at an earlier date.\n\nMs Miller's lawyers are, however, asking the justices for a repeat of the declaration from Edinburgh's Court of Session that the PM's actions were \"null and void and of no legal effect\".\n\nIf her side wins, it's still unclear how and when Parliament would resume - whether MPs could simply return to the Commons, or if they would need to be recalled by The Queen on the advice of Mr Johnson.\n\nEither way, Mr Johnson would face enormous pressure to resign. Dominic Grieve QC, the former attorney general and Conservative MP, has said the PM's position would be \"untenable\" if it is found that he misled the Queen over the reasons for proroguing Parliament.\n\nWhat other cases end up in the Supreme Court?\n\nThe justices hear cases that have been considered in lower courts in any part of the United Kingdom, other than some issues from Northern Ireland, and appeals against criminal convictions from Scotland.\n\nThere is always an odd number of Supreme Court justices. so that if they disagree on the outcome, there is a clear majority ruling one way or the other.\n\nThe court will be 10 years old on 1 October and it has so far heard 835 appeals, including cross-appeals, where a defendant asks a higher court to review a lower court's decision, and linked cases.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nWho are the Supreme Court justices?\n\nNew justices are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of a panel of legal experts from each of the UK's nations. Applicants must have been a High Court judge for at least two years or a practising lawyer for 15.\n\nImage copyright Supreme Court HO Image caption Lady Hale was appointed as president of the Supreme Court in September 2017\n\nEleven of the court's justices will hear the case against the government.
