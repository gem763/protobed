He said he pulled over and fell asleep.\n\nThe responding officers found Johnson slumped over but allowed him to drive home and did not administer a breathalyzer test or a field sobriety test. Johnson said officers do such tests only when a motorist appears impaired or officers smell alcohol or cannabis.\n\nHe said the medical episode was the result of not following doctor\u2019s orders.\n\n\u201cWhen he adjusted my medication, I took the old medication for high blood pressure, but I failed to put the new medication in,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring a news conference with then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel in early 2017, Johnson had to be helped to a seat after he wobbled and appeared to be about ready to fall to the ground.\n\nJohnson was diagnosed decades ago with a kidney condition, which two years ago led to a transplant \u2014 with his son as the donor. Earlier this year he was hospitalized for a blood clot.\n\nIn her comments, Lightfoot said that Johnson told her about how he had just changed medication, and said she has \u201cno reason to doubt\u201d his account of what happened.\n\n\u201cWe know he\u2019s had some medical issues,\u201d she told the Sun-Times. \u201cHe\u2019s on the other side of a kidney (transplant) operation, which is obviously very, very serious. There have been some issues with high blood pressure, and so forth.\u201d\n\nShe also said that she knows from dealing with her parents that certain medications have side effects. \u201cSo I take him at his word.\u201d\n\nShe also did not condemn Johnson for having some drinks with dinner. \u201cHe\u2019s a grown man,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had a couple of drinks with dinner.\u201d\n\nJohnson has been trying to restore public confidence in the department shattered by the 2015 release of the now infamous dashcam video of the fatal 2014 police shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald, both of which happened before he became superintendent. He said he wanted to take steps that would assure the public that his account was accurate.\n\nThe investigation into Johnson will be handled by the public integrity unit within the department\u2019s internal affairs division, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Friday. That unit is comprised of officers who are detailed to the FBI and work out of the FBI\u2019s Chicago office.\n\n\u201cIf they have any sense that there was any impropriety, they would refer the case to outside investigative agencies,\u201d Guglielmi added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chicago's mayor said Friday that the city's top police officer told her he'd had \"a couple of drinks with dinner\" before he fell asleep at a stop sign while driving home, an incident that the chief contends was related to a change in his blood pressure medication.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Don Babwin"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/chicago_police_superintendent_99129_c0-249-2990-1993_s1200x700.jpg?56d137a4a332f01ab6cdfb2c926e2c64b15e002f", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
