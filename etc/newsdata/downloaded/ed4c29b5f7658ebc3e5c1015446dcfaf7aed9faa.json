He drives off. Two U.S. Park Police officers chase him and, minutes later, repeatedly shoot him in the head. The man, Bijan Ghaisar, a 25-year-old accountant, dies after 10 days in a coma.\n\nNearly two years later, the FBI has released virtually no information about its investigation into the police shooting. But police videos of the shooting raise questions that must be answered: What threat was so grave that the officers seemingly ignored protocol, and common sense, to shoot an unarmed man multiple times at point-blank range? And why are the FBI and federal prosecutors taking so long?\n\nM.D. D.C. Potomac G.W.

It\u2019s a minor incident; no one is hurt, and property damage is slight.\n\nMost of what is known about that evening comes from a video released by the Fairfax County Police Department. It was recorded by a police cruiser that was trailing Ghaisar\u2019s Jeep and the Park Police SUV chasing him.\n\n7:38 p.m.\n\nThe recording released to the public starts at 7:38 p.m., approximately nine minutes after Ghaisar\u2019s vehicle is rear-ended. A few seconds into the video, Ghaisar stops in the right lane. The Park Police vehicle pulls just in front of him.\n\n7:38 p.m. First interception attempt on video Pursuit route Video begins START ALEXANDRIA END FAIRFAX CO.

Park Police vehicle Weapon Ghaisar\u2019s Jeep Officer bangs on the Jeep Officer Ghaisar drives away\n\nIn most traffic stops, the police car would stop behind the vehicle in question. In this case, the officers try to block Ghaisar\u2019s Jeep, then approach his vehicle with guns drawn. Conceivably, that might be authorized if officers believe a suspect has committed a felony in leaving the scene of an accident. But leaving the scene of an accident becomes a felony in Virginia only if there is an injury or more than $1,000 in damage. Neither seems to apply in this case, though it is unclear whether the officers knew that.\n\nA few seconds after he is stopped, Ghaisar slowly edges to the right and drives off, leaving the two officers behind. One of them bangs his weapon on the window of Ghaisar\u2019s Jeep as it pulls away.\n\n(Fairfax County Police Department)\n\n\u201cThat traffic stop was bad police procedure,\u201d said Cedric L. Alexander, a psychologist who was a police chief in Rochester, N.Y, and DeKalb County, Ga. \u201cIt didn\u2019t give the officers adequate cover. When he bangs on the window, there\u2019s nothing there procedurally that I am familiar with. He could have accidentally fired the weapon, it could have hurt himself or someone.\u201d\n\nBlocking a vehicle is not authorized in many police departments because it creates an unsafe situation \u2014 the evading driver could run into the police car or the officers. The most common procedure is to pull behind a suspect and approach the vehicle cautiously.\n\nAccording to Geoffrey P. Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, pulling in front of a suspect\u2019s car could be justifiable if the police thought the suspect was an imminent threat who needed to be stopped. But Mr. Alpert points out contradictions in the Park Police officers\u2019 actions: They try to block Ghaisar\u2019s vehicle but then make themselves vulnerable by walking toward him.\n\nIn one of the few dispatch audio recordings made public, an officer says Ghaisar is fleeing from a hit-and-run scene. It remains unknown what else the officers may (or may not) know.\n\nGhaisar continues along the parkway. He doesn\u2019t weave; his driving is not erratic. He sticks to his lane and, using his turn indicator, exits the parkway in the Fort Hunt neighborhood of Fairfax County, slows down and is halted by Park Police again.\n\n7:40 p.m.\n\nThe officers pull in front of Ghaisar\u2019s Jeep, exit their vehicle and move toward him with their weapons drawn. It is not uncommon for police officers to approach a suspect with weapons drawn if they believe there is a threat. From the video, however, Ghaisar does not appear to pose any threat. He slowly maneuvers his Jeep to the right, away from the approaching officers, and drives off again.\n\n7:40 p.m. Second stop on video G.W. Memorial PKWY. Ghaisar Mt.

Officer Ghaisar\u2019s Jeep Knee bump Ghaisar drives away\n\nAs the vehicle pulls away, one of the officers appears to thrust his knee into the side of Ghaisar\u2019s vehicle. To Mr. Alexander, the former police chief, the officer\u2019s action reflects inadequate training.\n\n\u201cIt tells me that the officer is frustrated in a situation [where it] appears he has lost control \u2014 the officer himself has lost composure,\u201d said Mr. Alexander. \"What\u2019s a knee strike to the car going to do?\u201d\n\n7:41 p.m.\n\nGhaisar comes to a halt for a third time on the video at a stop sign at the intersection of Fort Hunt Road and Alexandria Avenue in Fairfax County.\n\nThe Park Police vehicle pulls in front of him again, and again the officers emerge with guns drawn, approaching Ghaisar\u2019s Jeep from the driver\u2019s side. What happens next on the video raises more questions. Ghaisar allows his Jeep to creep slowly forward, turning the vehicle away from an officer coming toward him. Again, there is no apparent threat to the police.\n\nNonetheless, an officer opens fire, five times, and the Jeep stops.\n\nPursuit route START ALEXANDRIA Video begins END FAIRFAX CO. 7:40 p.m. Ghaisar is shot Alexandria Ave. Ghaisar Park Police FORT HUNT RD. 1 Park police vehicle Ghaisar\u2019s Jeep Officer An officer takes position in front of Ghaisar\u2019s Jeep. 2 Officer Ghaisar\u2019s Jeep moves slowly, and the officer fires five times. 3 Officer The vehicle moves slowly, and the officer fires two more times. 4 Ghaisar\u2019s S.U.V.

The Jeep stops for about 11 seconds, then again begins to roll. And again the police fire, another two shots \u2014 that\u2019s nine in all \u2014 before the Jeep tilts into a ditch.\n\nGunshot wounds Four shots struck Ghaisar\u2019s head, and one hit his right wrist.

Wounds likely from entry and exit point of the same gunshot Multiple gunshots Likely from the same gunshot\n\nIn each instance, Ghaisar, after stopping, has maneuvered his Jeep away from the officers who are approaching him on the driver\u2019s side. The police may have been annoyed. They may have been angry, understandably. At no time, however, do they appear in danger. Ghaisar\u2019s driving is evasive; it is not menacing. Police are tasked with keeping their cool under far more trying circumstances. In this case, they do not.\n\nThe video below shows the moment the officers open fire. Warning: The scene is disturbing.\n\n\u201cUnless there was a threat to the officer\u2019s life, I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s justified to use deadly force,\u201d said Mr. Alpert of the University of South Carolina. \u201cHe\u2019s escaping, but that doesn\u2019t justify the use of deadly force.\"\n\nWhat impelled the actions of the officers, Alejandro Amaya and Lucas Vinyard? Nearly two years have passed, and that question remains unanswered \u2014 though they invoked \u201cself-defense,\u201d implausibly and without explanation, in responding to a lawsuit this year from Ghaisar\u2019s parents.\n\n\u201cCan you really call two years later reasonable?\u201d Mr. Alexander asked about the FBI investigation. \u201cIt creates doubts in the minds of people who are already living in an environment when they are questioning the credibility of the police. The longer it sits out there in the dark space, it creates doubt, resentment and an image that police are trying to cover for themselves.\u201d\n\nWhat now?\n\nKelly and James Ghaisar, parents of Bijan Ghaisar, staged a protest this month after U.S. Park Police Chief Robert MacLean was promoted to lead the Interior Department's Office of Law Enforcement and Security. (Kate Woodsome and Joshua Carroll/The Washington Post)\n\nWhat explains the fate of Ghaisar, a college graduate, young accountant and proud Patriots fan known for his ebullient personality? Why did police chase him after an apparently routine traffic incident? Why did they approach his Jeep with guns drawn when he pulled over? Why did Ghaisar, who was unarmed, repeatedly pull away after he was stopped? What prompted police to open fire, and shoot him again and again?\n\nAnd why, 22 months after the incident, has no explanation been offered to the public, to members of Congress who have made repeated inquiries, or to the Ghaisar family? Protests by his parents, relatives and friends have prompted no official response.\n\n\u201cThis is supposed to be democracy. Rules. Their own rules, which they didn\u2019t follow.\u201d James Ghaisar, father of Bijan Ghaisar.\n\nThere has been no response from the Park Police, which shifted the investigation to the FBI almost immediately \u2014 or even a formal review of policy and procedures. No word from the FBI, which has rebuffed not only journalists but also senators and a congressman who demanded information on the investigation. And no transparency from the office of U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu, the chief federal prosecutor in the District of Columbia, who would make the call on whether to seek an indictment, depending on the investigation\u2019s results.\n\nFrom every official source, there is almost nothing but silence. The officers remain on paid administrative duty. Certainly there is no hint of accountability, no sense that the public is entitled to know what took place. A man with no prior criminal record is shot by police, and the result is a snail\u2019s-pace inquiry so opaque that it might be mistaken for no investigation at all, or a phony one undertaken by a tinpot regime.\n\nThat is an affront to the public, which may reasonably wonder if official impunity and coverup are the default instinct by law enforcement officers following a police shooting. And for Ghaisar\u2019s family, it is an unimaginable ongoing torment.\n\nBelow is the entire video recorded by the Fairfax County Police Department cruiser and used in this editorial.
