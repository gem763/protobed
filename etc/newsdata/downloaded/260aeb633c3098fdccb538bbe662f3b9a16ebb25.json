( RMBS ) . Cramer replied that he would rather own Nvidia Corp. ( NVDA ) . So, let's check out the charts of NVDA.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of Action Alerts PLUS holding NVDA, below, we can see that prices have been outlining a large triangle-like pattern from April. Higher lows can be seen in June, August and September. There are some roughly equal highs around $190. NVDA is currently above the 50-day moving average line and the slower-to-react 200-day line. Both averages have a positive slope.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a similar pattern of higher lows and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a bullish configuration above the zero line.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of NVDA, below, we can see a positive picture. Prices are trading above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is overall very positive the past three years with limited weakness the past year. The weekly MACD oscillator is moving above the zero line for an outright go long signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of NVDA, below, we can see a potential upside price target of $202. A rally to $202 is likely to be an important upside breakout and open the way to still further gains in the months ahead.\n\nBottom-line strategy: The charts of NVDA look fairly positive so traders should approach the stock from the long side.", "description": "Nvidia Is Sporting a Bullish Set of Charts: Here's What to Do...RMBS", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Nvidia Is Sporting A Bullish Set Of Charts", "Here'S What To Do", "Prices Have Been Outlining A Large Triangle-Like Pattern April.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Doug Kass", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Cramer", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/3ee063e8-a226-11e8-9442-d78bd92b399f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
