It\u2019s a rare form of cancer that normally only affects kids, and at stage four it was really aggressive. I was in total shock. I had seen adverts saying \u2018if you have a lump get it checked out\u2019, but I didn\u2019t in a million years think that I would get cancer.\n\nI was transferred to Queen\u2019s Medical Centre in Nottingham and, due to the late stage of my cancer, treatment started straight away with no conversation about fertility.\n\nI had to have nine rounds of aggressive chemotherapy. It really took it out of me. I lost a lot of weight, along with some other unpleasant side effects. I was so weak that I couldn\u2019t walk upstairs by myself, I was really nauseous, I got mouth sores and I lost all my hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI then needed radiotherapy. Before I started my radiotherapy, I had an appointment at the hospital where they went through the list of side effects. One of the side effects listed to me was infertility.\n\nTo be told that I could be infertile hit me quite hard. I knew that I wanted to have a family at some point. I had an inkling that the treatment might affect my fertility, but after that initial mention of infertility no-one brought it up again.\n\nAfter 28 sessions of radiotherapy, I worked up the courage to ask about it. I broached the topic with my consultant and asked: \u2018On a scale of zero to 10 \u2013 zero being completely infertile and 10 being very fertile \u2013 where am I?\u2019 My consultant said zero.\n\nI\u2019d had 18 months of intense treatment up to that point and I knew it could come with serious side effects, but this was still really difficult news to receive. Not only were my ovaries damaged from the chemotherapy, but I was also told that the radiotherapy had scarred my uterus to the point that I would never be able to carry a child to full term.\n\nWhile I was told before my radiotherapy treatment that infertility was a possible side effect, no-one discussed this with me before chemotherapy.\n\nAt no point during my treatment did a doctor instigate a conversation about fertility \u2013 I had to bring it up myself.\n\nStarting this conversation as a 14-year-old was really difficult. If someone had just initiated that conversation with me, it would have made my life so much easier.\n\nEllie Waters wants cancer and fertility to be discussed during treatment (Picture: Teenage Cancer Trust)\n\nI didn\u2019t know that chemotherapy could cause infertility because no-one told me. I didn\u2019t know which fertility treatment options were available to me either. It would have taken a short discussion with a doctor or nurse to help me understand this, and that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I want children in the future, my options are surrogacy or adoption. This is something I am learning to accept. Although I have a good perspective on it now, it has been a lot of hard work.\n\nRecent research by Teenage Cancer Trust has found that a lack of communication around fertility could be robbing young cancer patients of their chance to have biological children. They\u2019re calling for every young person with cancer to have their fertility options explained to them by a health professional, along with fully funded access to egg and sperm freezing, plus access to fertility services.\n\nThe impact of cancer doesn\u2019t leave you once the treatment stops. I will be dealing with the side effects of the radiotherapy for the rest of my life. I am a positive person and as I really want a family when I am older, I have decided that I want to adopt children. I think it\u2019s amazing to be able to give your love and care to someone else who needs it.\n\nThere are so many long-term side effects to cancer that make life more challenging.\n\nLife after cancer isn\u2019t easy but better conversations and options around fertility treatment could make life so much easier for people who might want to have their own children in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find out more about Teenage Cancer Trust here.\n\nMORE: CBBC\u2019s Greg Jenner announces birth of miracle baby girl after heartbreaking 10 years of fertility issues\n\nMORE: Women are reclaiming the word \u2018barren\u2019 to talk about their fertility issues\n\nMORE: Bride with fertility issues slams guest for giving her a pregnancy test and onesies as a wedding gift\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "I went through the menopause aged 15.", "authors": ["Ellie Waters"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ellie-5-78a5-e1571929153635_1572078678.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
