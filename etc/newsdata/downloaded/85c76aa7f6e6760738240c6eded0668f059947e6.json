Three Metro employees came to the aid of the boy, who emerged from the train after the stabbing and approached the fare gates, Newsham said.\n\n\u201cHats off to them for trying to save this kid\u2019s life,\u201d he said of the Metro workers.\n\nAD\n\nChuck Decker, 20, an American University student, said he entered the station moments after the stabbing. He said the victim was inside the fare gate on the ground and seemed to be bleeding profusely from the neck area.\n\nAD\n\nNewsham said it wasn\u2019t known what school or schools the teens attended, but noted D.C. Public Schools weren\u2019t in session Friday. He said investigators are combing through Metro surveillance video.\n\n\u201cWe have video technicians going through that right now, so we should have a real clear picture of what happened,\u201d Newsham said.\n\nPolice had said they were searching for a teenage girl in connection with the stabbing, described as 14 years old, black and weighing about 100 pounds, with short dreadlocks and wearing a black, hooded sweatshirt with khaki pants.\n\nAD\n\nNewsham said he couldn\u2019t explain a recent spike in violence across the city that included five homicides since Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of the cases we\u2019ve seen in Ward 6 are tied together.\u201d\n\nThe Capitol South Metro station was closed as police investigated the stabbing in the 300 block of 1st Street SE. Trains on Metro\u2019s Orange, Blue and Silver lines were bypassing the station.\n\nAD\n\nMetro officials recommended commuters use the Eastern Market or Federal Center SW stations as alternates. Transit officials said the station was likely to remain closed for some time.\n\nThe Capitol South Metro station is less than two blocks south of the U.S. Capitol grounds and across the street from the Cannon House Office Building.\n\nAD", "description": "Police were searching for a 14-year-old girl in connection with the incident.", "authors": ["Justin Wm.
