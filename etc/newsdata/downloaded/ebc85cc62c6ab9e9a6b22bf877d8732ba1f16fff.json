REUTERS/Julio-Cesar Chavez\n\nThe demand from shareholders Paul Foster and Jeff Stevens comes when Marathon is already under pressure after activist investor Elliott Management Corp revived its call for the company to be split into three, saying it would boost shareholder value by as much as $40 billion.\n\nFoster and Stevens, who together own about 1.7% of Marathon, agreed with \"the majority\" of Elliott's proposals, but said an immediate management change was necessary to boost shareholder value. (bwnews.pr/2lFV9ck)\n\nBillionaire Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott, which owned 0.7% of Marathon as of June 30, according to Refinitiv data, was not immediately available to comment on the investors letter.\n\nMarathon said the board firmly and unanimously supported Heminger, who has been the chairman and chief executive officer since the company separated from Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) in 2011.\n\nHis membership of the board is due up for shareholder vote in 2020, according to Marathon\u2019s 2019 proxy statement. Shareholders had at the 2018 annual meeting rejected a proposal for an independent chairman.\n\nElliott said its call to separate Marathon\u2019s retail, refining and midstream assets was prompted by the company\u2019s failure to deliver on past promises and \u201cchronic underperformance\u201d.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares have fallen 6% this year, compared with a 7.4% gain in the S&P oil and gas refining and marketing index. At the year\u2019s low of $43.96 in August, its shares touched 2016 levels.\n\nMarathon has said it would \u201cthoroughly evaluate\u201d Elliott\u2019s proposal and was focussed on increasing shareholder value.\n\nAnother shareholder DE Shaw has backed Elliott\u2019s call to split the company, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. DE Shaw has a stake of about 0.9% in Marathon, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal had earlier reported on the Stevens and Foster\u2019s letter to the board.", "description": "Marathon Petroleum Corp said on Friday the company's board supported Gary Heminger staying on as chief executive officer amid calls for his ouster from two top 10 shareholders.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434454289&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0HW", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
