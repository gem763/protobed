But they lost their quarterback soon after the opening kickoff.\n\nThe No. 2 overall pick in the 2017 draft, Trubisky was scrambling when Danielle Hunter dragged him down. The quarterback\u2019s non-throwing arm got pinned awkwardly under his body as the ball popped out. Minnesota made the recovery, but a holding penalty against Anthony Harris negated the play.\n\nTrubisky headed to the sideline and walked to the locker room a few minutes later.\n\nDaniel came on and connected with Tarik Cohen on a 10-yard touchdown to complete a 14-play drive. The 10th-year pro completed 22 of 30 passes.\n\nAllen Robinson had seven catches for 77 yards. Nick Williams had two sacks. Khalil Mack and Roy Robertson-Harris each had 1 1/2.\n\nThe Bears (3-1) held Cook to 35 yards on 14 attempts after he ran for at least 110 in the first three games, even though Akiem Hicks (knee) and linebacker Roquan Smith (personal reasons) missed the game. The Monsters of the Midway also held a big edge in time of possession (35:27 to 24:33) on the way to their third straight win.\n\nCook, who came in with 375 yards rushing, spoiled the Bears\u2019 bid for their first shutout since 2010 when he ran it in from the 2 in the closing minutes.\n\nKirk Cousins was 27 of 36 for 233 yards and got sacked six times as the Vikings (2-2) lost to Chicago on the road for the 16th time in 19 games.\n\nThe Bears took a big step toward the NFC North championship last season when they beat Minnesota at Soldier Field. They then kept the Vikings out of the playoffs with a road win to close the regular season while sweeping them for the first time since 2011.\n\nAnd they got a win they sorely needed on Sunday if they\u2019re going to defend their division championship. , Chicago outgained the Vikings 182 yards to 59 in the first half and held them to just two possessions.\n\nThe Bears took a 10-0 lead to the locker room after Eddy Pineiro\u2019s 25-yard field goal at the end of the first half. They had to settle for another field goal after Mack sacked Cousins on the first play from scrimmage of the second half.\n\nChicago took over at the Minnesota 16 after Williams made the recovery, and Pineiro\u2019s 38-yarder made it 13-0. He added a 30-yard field goal with just over three minutes left in the third.\n\nINJURIES\n\nVikings: G Josh Kline (concussion) missed the game.\n\nBears: G Kyle Long missed the game because of a hip injury. He did not practice Thursday or Friday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nVikings: Visit New York Giants on Sunday.\n\nBears: Play Oakland in London on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chase Daniel threw for 195 yards and a touchdown after Mitchell Trubisky got knocked out of the game with a left shoulder injury on the opening possession, and the Chicago Bears swarmed NFL rushing leader Dalvin Cook in a 16-6 victory over the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Seligman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/vikings_bears_football_14455_c0-219-5239-3273_s1770x1032.jpg?2c82911b4c4a375d8b853e7f66f7b90dfae39a90", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
