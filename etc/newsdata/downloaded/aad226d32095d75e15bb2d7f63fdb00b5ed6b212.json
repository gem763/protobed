He has confirmed he will be back for the Australian Open towards the end of January.\n\nThe team competition sees 24 countries compete against each other \u2014 initially in a round-robin group stage \u2014 and Federer's Switzerland side were scheduled to start their campaign against Murray's Great Britain in Sydney on January 3.\n\nRoger Federer has opted against playing in January's inaugural ATP Cup event in Australia\n\nAndy Murray has flourished on his return to action, winning the title in Antwerp two weeks ago\n\nROGER FEDERER VS ANDY MURRAY Roger Federer Grand Slams: 20\n\nTitles: 103 Andy Murray Grand Slams: 3\n\nTitles: 46 H2H: Federer leads 14-11\n\nIt would have been the first meeting between the two since a semi-final in Cincinnati four years ago.\n\nBut with the veteran desperate to try and win a maiden Olympic gold medal in Tokyo in August, he is keen to keep himself fresh.\n\n'It is with great regret that I am withdrawing from the inaugural ATP Cup event,' said Federer on the tournament's official website.\n\n'When I entered the event last month, it was a really difficult decision because it meant less time at home with the family and a fully intense start to the season.\n\nInteresting from Federer, pulling out of new ATP Cup extravaganza in Jan to spend more time at home. Equivalent Hopman Cup dates didn\u2019t bother him, infact played first match of this season on Dec 30 2018 at that event. \u2014 Mike Dickson (@Mike_Dickson_DM) October 30, 2019\n\n'After much discussion with both my family and my team about the year ahead, I have decided that the extra two weeks at home will be beneficial for both my family and my tennis.\n\n'It pains me to not be a part of the most exciting new event on the calendar. But this is the right thing to do if I want to continue to play for a longer period of time on the ATP Tour.\n\nFederer won his 10th title Swiss Indoors title in Basel on Sunday, his 103rd singles title overall\n\n'I am sorry for any inconvenience or disappointment my withdrawal may cause for the fans, but I hope you can understand why I made it.\n\n'For my Australian fans, I look forward to seeing you all at the Australian Open, fresh and ready to go.'\n\nAs a result of his withdrawal, Switzerland drop out of the tournament as they only qualified due to Federer's ranking.", "description": "The 38-year-old, currently ranked three in the world, had committed to playing the inaugural tournament in Australia at the start of 2020, but has opted out in order to spend more time with his family.", "authors": ["Jonathan Veal", "Press Association Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/11/20370956-0-image-a-44_1572434088210.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
