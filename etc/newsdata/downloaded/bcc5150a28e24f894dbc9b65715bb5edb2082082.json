The measures will mean a revenue loss of 1.45 trillion rupees for the current year.\n\nIndia is likely to miss its fiscal deficit target for the current financial year, despite receiving an additional dividend from the central bank, five government officials and advisers told Reuters this month, as tax collections have sunk amid a sharp slowdown.\n\nThe sources had said the government could, toward the end of 2019, be forced to raise the fiscal deficit target to 3.5% of GDP from 3.3% after economic growth fell to a six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter.\n\nRating firm Moody\u2019s, however, said India\u2019s move will boost net income of companies and was \u201ccredit positive\u201d for them.\n\nThe \u201cextent of final impact on credit profiles of Indian corporates will depend on whether they utilise the surplus earnings for reinvestment in business, debt reduction or high shareholder returns,\u201d said Vikas Halan, senior vice president of corporate finance group at Moody\u2019s Investors Service.\n\nThe government has been trying to boost private capital expenditure which has struggled due to a lack of recovery in corporate earnings and a sharp drop in consumer demand.", "description": "Rating firm S&P Global said on Friday India's move to cut corporate tax rates was a \"credit negative development\" despite potentially boosting the economy as it will widen its fiscal deficit.", "authors": ["Abhirup Roy", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431979034&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J13C", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
