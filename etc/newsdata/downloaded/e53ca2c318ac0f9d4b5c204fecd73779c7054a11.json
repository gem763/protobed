Compared to how quickly and broadly iOS updates hit iPhones across the world, that is a glacial pace. Some years, it grates. Some years, you can make your peace with it. But every year, it\u2019s the same. That\u2019s just how the Android ecosystem works.\n\nThis year, like last year, I\u2019m leading my review of Android by repeating the bare facts about these update rates because it\u2019s so much more relevant to most people than the actual features of the OS. It\u2019s possible that things will be slightly better this year \u2014 Google is hinting at it pretty strongly \u2014 but for now, the only people who can reliably get Android updates in a timely manner are Pixel owners.\n\nThose Pixel owners will find that Android 10 offers a few splashy features, a few important privacy protections, and a surprising amount of confusion. It\u2019s an update that throws a lot of features at the wall to see what sticks. Some of it is really nice and some of it is long overdue, but this is not an OS with a clear vision of what\u2019s next for Android. It\u2019s an OS designed to fix what\u2019s broken with it today.\n\nFixing what\u2019s broken is great, which makes the fact that so few people will get the update until next year (or the year after) even more annoying.\n\nNote: This review is based on the final public beta of Android 10, which Google says is functionally identical to the shipping version. In 24 hours of testing, we haven\u2019t found any major differences, but we will update this review if we note anything significantly different.\n\nOur review of Google Android 10 Verge Score 7.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Dark Theme\n\nNotifications are easier to manage\n\nMuch easier to control privacy permissions Bad Stuff Gestures don\u2019t let you slide open app drawers\n\nOverlapping Digital Wellbeing features\n\nAndroid updates still take too long to arrive on most phones\n\nGestures\n\nThe thing that every Android 10 user will notice first is the thing that has garnered the most attention over the course of the betas for Android Q (the codename for Android 10). That\u2019s the new gesture navigation system, of course. It\u2019s been contentious in part because all change is, in part because it breaks the way many Android apps work, and in part because it\u2019s a little confusing.\n\nThe new gesture system \u2014 which is optional \u2014 replaces all the buttons at the bottom with a single white bar, just like the iPhone. Also like the iPhone, you can swipe up to go home, swipe in a kind of a hook move to get into an overview screen, and swipe straight across to quickly switch between apps. Unlike iOS, Android uses an app drawer. To access that, you swipe up from the bottom when on the home screen.\n\nThose gestures miss the most important (and, surprisingly enough, the most-used) button on Android: back. Google\u2019s solution is to make the entire left and right sides of the screen dedicated to going back when you swipe in from the edge.\n\nLastly, Google Assistant also has a new gesture: swiping in diagonally from either of the bottom corners. On the home screen, two little curved lines sometimes appear to remind you that extra gesture exists.\n\nSo:\n\nSwipe from the bottom: go home or go to the overview screen\n\nSwipe up from the bottom on the home screen: open the app drawer\n\nSwipe across the bottom: switch apps\n\nSwipe from either side: go back\n\nSwipe diagonally up from the bottom corners: Google Assistant\n\nSwipe down from the top: open Quick Settings and notifications\n\nThis all seems very complicated because it is very complicated. It\u2019s a lot to keep in your head. But after you use Android 10 for a few minutes, it all feels intuitive and fluid. The animations aren\u2019t quite as nice as they are on an iPhone, but not so much that it\u2019s ever truly bothered me.\n\n\u201cBack\u201d is used more than \u201cHome,\u201d so Google dedicated both sides of the screen to the back gesture\n\nAll that is well and good, but in the Android world, it\u2019s caused quite a stir. I think a lot of that is just resistance to change and unhappiness that the change is to make Android work more like the iPhone (as opposed to the gesture systems cooked up by the likes of Samsung and OnePlus, which work but are much less discoverable).\n\nBut the real stir happened because of the way many \u2014 if not most \u2014 Android apps are designed. Before Android 10, you could swipe in from the left edge to open an app drawer where important stuff is often scurried away. In Android 10, that swipe now takes you back. Google has tried to appease the drawer swipers (who, it contends, represent a tiny minority of users) with a weird tap-and-hold thing that is incredibly inconsistent, leading to yet more complaints.\n\nI explained all this in detail before, and now that I\u2019ve lived with the newest gesture system for a couple of weeks, here\u2019s where I\u2019ve landed: I like it. I am annoyed by not being able to swipe in drawers, but I mostly agree with the trade-offs Google made. Going back is now literally a broad gesture: just swipe on the side of the phone. Making the most common action on an Android phone easy and consistent is more important than app drawers.\n\nAlthough the option to go back to buttons exists if you want it, I haven\u2019t. Even if you\u2019re dubious, I recommend turning them on and using them for a few weeks. You might find that you prefer them to the buttons. I do.\n\nI do, however, hope app makers adjust their apps to this new back gesture world quickly. I also think that Google is going to futz around with these gestures again once Android 11 rolls around, so I\u2019m not going to get too attached to them.\n\nDark Theme\n\nOffering a dark mode (Google calls it a \u201ctheme,\u201d though there aren\u2019t other theming options besides light and dark) is quite the trend this year. Google jumped on it, and guess what? More screens have dark backgrounds now. A lot more work goes into making an elegant dark mode than most people realize, and Android\u2019s designers have done a good enough job for me not to notice their work.\n\nUnfortunately, Google\u2019s app designers haven\u2019t prioritized making their apps support dark theming. Too many of them don\u2019t switch over to the Dark Theme right now, though Google says they\u2019re working on it.\n\nI don\u2019t have a religion when it comes to dark mode versus light mode, but I do like having the option. It\u2019s strange that you can\u2019t set it to turn on automatically at sunset, though, like you can with Night Light and the dark themes on Samsung devices and soon the iPhone with iOS 13.\n\nFocus Mode and Notifications\n\nStarting today, Google is offering beta access to a new feature called Focus Mode, which is sort of a weird hybrid between the App Timers you get in Digital Wellbeing and Do Not Disturb.\n\nFocus Mode lets you blacklist a set of apps that you find distracting. Then, when you toggle Focus Mode, those apps get grayed out and are shut down in the background. They won\u2019t send you notifications, and when you try to launch them, you\u2019ll get a pop-up that gently suggests, \u201cHey, didn\u2019t you say you wanted to focus right now?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good \u2014 and compared to Do Not Disturb, it\u2019s potentially more useful because it\u2019s not a blanket ban on all notifications \u2014 but if you are trying to alter your relationship to your phone through Android\u2019s tools, you now have to adjust a wild number of vectors to do that:\n\nDo Not Disturb Focus Mode App Timers in Digital Wellbeing Notification priority settings Channels within notifications (for apps that offer different settings for different types) Parental Controls\n\nThere are too many modes\n\nIt is quite a lot, but as with the new gesture system, you can make sense of it all by interacting with your phone relatively naturally. Parental controls are linked directly from the Digital Wellbeing settings, for example, and Focus Mode runs you through a little tutorial to explain what\u2019s happening.\n\nNotifications still have that little gear that lets you directly change settings right when they appear. But instead of the complicated priority settings from before, there\u2019s simply a button to either kill them or move them to a \u201csilent\u201d section. If you want more granular notification controls, you can go find them.\n\nOverall, Google\u2019s solution to smartphone overload is to offer users as much information and as many tools as possible, which is overwhelming in its own right. This is another area of Android 10 that I suspect is going to be revisited next year \u2014 at least, I hope it is \u2014 because right now, it puts way too much of the burden on the user to understand all of these different frameworks.\n\nSpeaking of notifications, Google has built in more intelligence on the smart reply buttons that pop up on them. It\u2019s more likely to show you relevant app buttons like Google Maps instead of one-word replies. As with Google\u2019s earlier AI efforts in Android (Slices and Actions), it\u2019s neat when it appears, but it\u2019s not something you can reliably expect will appear with every notification.\n\nPermissions, privacy, and updates\n\nThe most important updates in Android 10 are new limitations on what apps can do and what information they can access. Google has posted a list of the major changes here, and it\u2019s quite long. Reading over it, however, nothing seems especially restrictive. If anything, it\u2019s shocking just how much apps were allowed to do in the background before now.\n\nAmong the most important changes, certainly the most visible, are new settings for location permissions for apps. For the first time, users will be able to choose a new option that only allows their location to be read when the app is in use. Before, it was all or nothing on Android, while the iPhone allowed this type of permission. And like iOS 13, Android 10 will periodically provide notifications to remind you that an app has been accessing your location in the background.\n\nThere are other important privacy features. I won\u2019t get into all of them, but here are a few:\n\nThe improved privacy features might be the most important thing in Android 10\n\nApps won\u2019t be able to access unchangeable device identifiers, which should make it harder for them to track you.\n\nApps aren\u2019t allowed to silently start and run in the background anymore; they have to pop a notification to say they\u2019re running.\n\nCamera access is more limited.\n\nAccess to Wi-Fi information is also more restricted. And since Wi-Fi could potentially reveal your location, apps will also need location permission to see information about your network.\n\nRight now, Android works a little more like your desktop computer where apps can access the entire hard disk. Android 10 introduces \u201cscoped storage,\u201d which only gives apps a filtered view outside their own silo, just like the iPhone. Unfortunately, scoped storage is only an option in Android 10. It won\u2019t become a requirement until next year.\n\nAnother big change in Android 10 is called \u201cProject Mainline,\u201d and it allows Google to push key security updates directly through the Google Play Store. This isn\u2019t the dream of timely major OS updates being pushed out without having to wait for manufacturers and carriers, but it\u2019s at least a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, Project Mainline will only be available on phones that ship with Android 10 by default, not on those that upgrade to it.\n\nLast but not least, Google has adjusted its settings menus so that all of your privacy settings are more easily located in one place (called \u201cPrivacy,\u201d naturally). Looking over it, it seems like a prime opportunity for Google to replicate the dashboard interface it\u2019s already using for Digital Wellbeing. It\u2019s convenient to have everything in one place, but a better visualization of what my apps are doing would be better.\n\nI do like that this section has shortcuts to the various Google dashboards for your Google account settings. Hopefully, those will stick around on non-Pixel phones, and Google will require manufacturers to provide similar privacy links in their phones.\n\nAndroid 10\u2019s flashiest feature is also, unfortunately, not available at launch: Live Caption. When I tried it earlier this year, I was impressed with how quickly and accurately it created closed captioning for any audio or video on the phone (even with the volume set to zero). It could be a major feature for users who are deaf or hard of hearing, but it won\u2019t arrive until later this year, and it will be available only on Pixel phones to start.\n\nThat last sentence is a real metaphor for Android: \u201cIt won\u2019t arrive when you want it to, and Pixel users will get it first.\u201d That\u2019s how Android updates work now, and at this point, it\u2019s clear that Google either likes it that way, or it doesn\u2019t have the will to make more radical changes to the ecosystem to fix the problem. (For those of us who have been watching Google waffle on a message strategy, it\u2019s a familiar conundrum.)\n\nMore mile marker than milestone\n\nThe privacy updates in Android 10 are important enough that I\u2019m more frustrated than usual that this update will take forever to reach the Android phones that most people actually buy. Many of the user-facing features, however, are less consequential than in previous years. Gestures and the Dark Theme are nice, but they don\u2019t fundamentally change the nature of the OS or give it new capabilities.\n\nOne of the things I like most about Android is how willing Google is to try new ideas. It can be wearying to have notification behaviors shift every year, but the way they work in Android 10 is so convenient, simple, and intuitive that it makes all that experimentation feel worth it.\n\nBut with Android 10, more features than usual seem like user experiments instead of user experiences. No software is ever really \u201cfinished\u201d (at least not until it becomes abandonware), but Android is starting to feel like it\u2019s in permanent beta \u2014 not because it\u2019s buggy, but because it\u2019s always tentative. There\u2019s always a sense that it\u2019s not yet in its final form. The new gestures may get rejected by users and manufacturers. The new confusing differences between Focus Mode, Do Not Disturb, and App Timers show that Google doesn\u2019t know what the right answer is yet.\n\nThat means Android 10 is not a milestone; it\u2019s a mile marker. It has made real progress and is heading in the right direction, but the landscape looks the same.", "description": "Android 10 offers a few splashy features, a few important privacy protections, and a surprising amount of confusion.
