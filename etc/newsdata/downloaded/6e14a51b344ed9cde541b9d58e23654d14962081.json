REUTERS/Mike Theiler\n\nAs IMF and World Bank annual meetings wound down, Georgieva told a news conference that members shared a view that reducing trade tensions would cut uncertainty and risks to growth.\n\n\u201cIn the discussions here, what we advanced was the understanding (of the need for) building more, if you wish, peer pressure, for everybody to play by the trade rule-book, and be willing to expand and improve this rule-book,\u201d Georgieva said.\n\nPolicymakers described a clear connection between trade tensions, higher uncertainty, reduced investment, lower growth and lost jobs, she said.\n\n\u201cWhen you follow this chain, what is the next shoe to drop? It would be consumer confidence,\u201d she said, referring to a pillar that has kept the U.S. economy performing well but is showing signs of weakening.\n\nIn a communique issued on Saturday, the IMF\u2019s steering committee said that trade tensions were among the key downside risks to the global economy and called for reform of the World Trade Organization.\n\nBut the final version eliminated a reference to a \u201cstrong multilateral trading system\u201d in an earlier draft.\n\nInstead, the International Monetary and Financial Committee, said: \u201cA strong international trading system with well-enforced rules addressing current and future challenges would support global growth.\u201d\n\nThe United States over the past three years has often shunned references to trade multilateralism as it pursues bilateral trade agreements under President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d trade policies.\n\nRelated Coverage IMF steering committee says trade tensions among key risks to global economy\n\n\u201cWe recognise the need to resolve trade tensions and support the necessary reform of the World Trade Organization to improve its functioning,\u201d it said.\n\nThe IMFC\u2019s chairman, South African central bank governor Lesetja Kganyago, put the trade tensions into starker terms. \u201cThere can\u2019t be winners in a trade war. In the end, the biggest loser is going to be the global economy.\u201d\n\nGeorgieva said that officials from both the United States and China both \u201ccommented positively\u201d on their recent trade discussions. Trump had outlined elements of a potential \u201cPhase 1\u201d deal on Oct. 11.", "description": "International Monetary Fund members discussed ways to increase \"peer pressure\" on countries to follow and improve global trade rules to reduce growth-sapping uncertainty, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said on Saturday.", "authors": ["David Lawder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442761777&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0KQ", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
