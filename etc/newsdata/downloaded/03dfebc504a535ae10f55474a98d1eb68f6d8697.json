Their lives would have been forever changed,\u201d Nicole said to CBS Evening News, who reportedly asked to go by only her first name.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating. I know I did all I can do and that I made the right choice,\u201d she added.\n\nNicole found out about her son\u2019s plot after reading his journal, where he discusses detonating pipe bombs to \u201cblast anyone in sight\u201d and using firearms to \u201cexecute survivors.\u201d\n\nHe also picked the anniversary of the Columbine massacre \u2014 April 20, 2020 \u2014 for the shooting.\n\nWhen asked how she feels about turning her son in, Nicole said, \u201cLike I\u2019ve done something wrong.\u201d\n\nBut College Place Police Chief Troy Tomaras applauded her as \u201cvery courageous\u201d and said her decision potentially saved countless lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly very emotional for her. She loves her son,\u201d he said. \u201cVery courageous, very grateful.\u201d\n\nNicole said she wasn\u2019t sure whether to make the call because her son said it was a creative writing exercise and that was \u201cjust a story\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s plotting to attack and kill people. That\u2019s beyond creative writing. That\u2019s beyond normal,\u201d Chief Tomaras said.\n\nNicole said she still loves her son and \u201cit wasn\u2019t easy\u201d to turn in her son, who she said has battled depression recently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about his mental health, and he needs help,\u201d Nicole said, adding he\u2019s safer in custody than in school. \u201cTruth hurts sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot to do what I did,\u201d she added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
