All the right smells were imprinting the moment we rolled through industrial Chatsworth, California. Sun-heated steel from the dash; stretched leather; a vague tinge of nicotine on Ward\u2019s jacket. One thing was missing, though: gasoline. The car wasn\u2019t burning any.\n\nBut when Ward stepped on the go-pedal, the vehicle warped toward the horizon like a hipster hillbilly spaceship.\n\nPhoto: Icon\n\nThere\u2019s a mind-bending weirdness to an art deco desert rat-style car skirting off with the futuristic whirr of a Tesla. But regardless of your stance on old-versus-new, it\u2019s conceptually pretty cool.\n\nWard is hardly the first person to try making a fancy electric car out of an old classic, and this Mercury isn\u2019t even the first EV out of his Icon shop. Icon is known for rebuilding and redressing classic SUVs at the highest level of elegance \u2013 such machines fetch six-figure price tags.\n\nLike everything else Icon\u2019s turned out, this electric Mercury\u2019s decorative details are lovely and it certainly feels fast off a stoplight. Dual electric motors and a Tesla Performance 85kWh battery pack will do that. So will its apparent 400 horsepower rating.\n\nWhat\u2019s really interesting about it though: exploring the unique challenges of marrying EV propulsion technology to a 70-year-old car. And more than that, figuring out where EVs fall in the ecosystem of enthusiast collector cars.\n\nEspecially for a shop like Ward\u2019s, which has built its entire brand on selling vehicles that are more like enduring art pieces than tools for transportation.\n\nCan EVs Be Made To Last?\n\nPhoto: Icon\n\n\u201cTraditionally, I\u2019m here to build shit that should last you forever. This should, and still could,\u201d Ward said, gesturing to the only car in his gigantic shop garage with an electric powertrain instead of V8. \u201cBut it might mean you\u2019re coming back. If you want to stay up with the latest science, you may be coming back and haemorrhaging more money to evolve with the state of the tech.\u201d\n\nWhat he means is, if you drop a healthy Chevy LS V8 into a car, it\u2019s still going to be relevant and serviceable in a decade. (Probably.) But EV tech is improving a lot more quickly. In fact, components in Ward\u2019s Mercury here has already been updated and upgraded in the time it\u2019s taken to build the thing.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t even let the client have it yet... shit, we\u2019ve gone through three generations of [updates] for the battery management system controllers,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the oil cooling system for the motors\u2014two design generational improvements from AMR. And me being the goober that I am, like, I don\u2019t just want to deliver it with what\u2019s already in there. I gain the knowledge that there\u2019s a latest and greatest and I\u2019m like, fuck.\u201d Meaning, he felt compelled to upgrade.\n\nWard mentioned, several times while I was hanging out with him, that he\u2019d been careful to \u201ctalk himself out of work\u201d to a lot of folks who\u2019ve asked him to build derelict-style EVs like this (and electric 4x4s, but more on that later) because it\u2019s a huge investment of time and money to drop into uncharted territory.\n\n\u201cFortunately, the client\u2019s a geek like me too,\u201d Ward said, adding that he\u2019d made it clear this was a guinea pig project.\n\nPhoto: Icon\n\nWard, having established one of the best-known custom car shops in California, now has the enviable problem of keeping up with himself. He\u2019s set a high standard for his wares, and he\u2019s going to have to be able to apply that to electric cars if he wants to maintain his reputation.\n\n\u201cWhat is the cultural, functional relevance of this,\u201d he said, pointing to the Mercury, \u201cin two years, forget 10. Is it an iPhone 5 now? Is it no longer relevant? Is the capability, refinement, and range so antiquated because the tech is moved along so fucking fast?\u201d\n\nIt was a rhetorical question, of course, because I have no clue. But it was interesting to hear one of the custom car scene\u2019s bigger names admit the same. I can tell you what else is fucking fast though: Ward\u2019s Tesla-powered Mercury.\n\nIt Ain\u2019t Rocket Science, But...\n\nPhoto: Icon\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot of \u201949 Mercury left inside this particular frankencar. The body\u2019s as-found, and the interior\u2019s reimagined as-original in aesthetic, but the powertrain and suspension and chassis are bespoke. It\u2019s more an exercise in building an electric driveline and placing the shell of an ancient car around it, rather than doing an EV engine swap on a classic.\n\nThe batteries had to be lifted out of a wrecked Tesla P85D since nobody can buy them off a shelf \u2013 another challenge of bringing a custom high-po electric car to life \u2013 and squirrelled around the vehicle to help give the vehicle perfectly even four-corner weight distribution, according to Ward.\n\nThat exacerbated the complexities of temperature control.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve yet to see any of the companies or DIY dudes... no one\u2019s addressing battery thermal management. At best, it\u2019s engine coolant through a 12-volt pump through a clear plastic tube. But, like, Tesla has a dedicated heater network and a dedicated refrigerant-based system, because there\u2019s a sweet spot for battery temperature for safety, longevity, performance, and range. and everyone\u2019s just shitcanning it entirely.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Icon\n\nWard\u2019s learned that keeping various components at certain temperatures has been one of the hardest parts of getting serious performance out of this car. \u201cYou can\u2019t just throw a unit in and pump shit through, because the batteries have a different thermal cycle than, say, the controllers,\u201d he told me.\n\n\u201cWhen people think of EV conversions, including my dumb arse, \u2018well shit it can\u2019t be that hard! just a motor, computer, and an energy source! It\u2019s easy!\u2019 Reality is, the [custom EV] industry started with that mentality and at the simplistic form of that, yeah, but if you really want it to be proper, it ain\u2019t this.\u201d\n\nWard went on to detail what he and his team, including an electrical engineering consultant brought on specifically to make this car work, had been thinking about:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you go to Mammoth [Mountain]. And charge up fully at a hotel. And then you go downhill for two and a half hours. Where are those electrons going to go? Like, into a ball of flame? Maybe. And no one\u2019s thinking that through.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Icon\n\n\u201cAnd, like, transmissions. If I was a smarter man I\u2019d do what 99 per cent of the [EV conversion world]\u2019s doing... you use one or two gears in [the existing] tranny, none of which are the ideal ratio in the first place, and neither is the third member.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny time you go through a tranny, it scavenges so much electrical energy that your efficiency goes to shit, now depending on whatever car it is... suddenly you\u2019re hearing shit that you never heard behind your Coyote V8 or your 454, and that further compounds the complexity. And what\u2019s the point, because, the ideal EV scenario, in my opinion, is transmission-less.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t really spend enough time driving the Mercury to claim a complete shakedown, but I did get to experience Ward\u2019s point about sounds. The steering and other bits made odd squeaks you never would have heard if the car was guzzling air and gas as god intended.\n\nAs for the gearless acceleration, I\u2019m onboard. It\u2019s pretty fascinating the way the car simply swoops up to speed with zero punctuation whatsoever.\n\nPhoto: Icon\n\n\u201cThese AMR oil-cooled motors, they\u2019re back to back, I placed them where the tranny was, and then I got this big crazy donkey dick of a driveshaft to a Dana 60 modular aluminium casing to an IRS rear. A friend at Dana helped me find this obscure gearset that got me as close to optimum as possible, so the end result is we\u2019re tranmissionless. Which means more fun when you\u2019re driving, because now you have no shift points, no gears...\u201d\n\nBringing electric vehicle design details to Icon\u2019s level was also a new challenge for Ward and the company. They had to figure out how to make a simple rectangular screen displaying information look cool, which meant utilising yet another company to digitally model a gauge design Icon had mocked up.\n\nBefore I could ask too many questions about that, Ward dove into another engineering wall he\u2019d come up against.\n\nPhoto: Icon\n\n\u201cSteering! Everyone, typically, goes \u2018oh that\u2019s no problem, you know there\u2019s this electric [power steering unit] inline with the column motors guys sell, just use that.\u2019 The reality is that the whole EPAS world is brand new and growing, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo those off-the-shelf solutions, you literally have a knob, a potentiometer, you\u2019re supposed to put on the dash. Because for an electric steering to really give you any proper dynamic feedback, it has to have a different rate, different feedback, different driver feel, when you\u2019re parking versus when you\u2019re doing 100.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s a knob on the dash that you are manually adjusting. You\u2019re not even networking to a vehicle speed sensor. So, like, that ain\u2019t gonna fly... We did one electric rack, on electric inline... both of them sucked. So, we ended up going with electrohydraulic from an MR2! Which, oddly enough, has been the best solution.\u201d\n\nOnce a car like this finally is buttoned up enough to ship out, it has to be kept alive. \u201cEverything from safety to marketing to permanence and longevity, serviceability. It\u2019s one thing to deliver something with an LS or a Coyote in it [typical car engines] and find a trusted service centre. It\u2019s another thing with EVs,\u201d said Ward. We had moved from inside his garage to a corner of his parking lot behind the dumpsters, something I only mention because that\u2019s how hard it was to find refuge from the sounds of welders and grinders furiously at work within his facility. Icon\u2019s a busy place these days; the market for custom-made six-figure cars is clearly substantial.\n\n\u201cWe design all the EVs to be submodular, so in theory, if there\u2019s an issue with one aspect of one system, it\u2019s removable... but at the same time, that rapidity of the design generational improvements concerns me.\u201d\n\nThe Last Inch To Perfection Is The Hardest\n\nPhoto: Icon\n\nWard\u2019s revered as something of a vanguard in the custom car world right now because the things his shop are making really are on another level of magnificence. Retooling an old Land Cruiser or Bronco down to custom-machined switchgear might not make sense objectively, but the Icon execution is exceptional. That\u2019s why Icon is unique, and porting that level of extreme detail-dialling to electric cars is a new deal for the shop.\n\n\u201cThe premise, back to my original... idea was, evolving classic transportation in a modern context,\u201d Ward said. \u201cKeep that beauty and style and design that I feel so connected to relevant for myself, then clients, because I needed clients to pull it off, so, I think it would be, negligent to not continue pushing. And, like, is [electric] the future of [transportation]? I don\u2019t know, but I know I want to be part of that exploration, that process, to find out.\u201d\n\nWard certainly feels like the market for EVs is expanding, at least in the short term. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s remotely environmentally aware is seeing the increasing pressures we\u2019re putting on our environment.\u201d In that respect, he thinks \u201cbattles with consumers\u201d on electric cars are already won.\n\n\u201cThe cool thing I am seeing though, that\u2019s gonna really enable the [electric car] market, is that the demand is exponentially increasing,\u201d Ward says that\u2019s inspiring both cottage industry and big businesses to get onboard.\n\nAs for the appeal of custom machines designed to feel retro: \u201cEven if, god forbid, in 10 years you need a special permit to have a human-driven motorcar, and we\u2019re all on rideshares or apps or autonomous vehicles, I still think, I would actually even argue there\u2019d be an increase in, consumers that are yearning for that visceral man-machine [relationship.]\u201d He leaned down to re-spark his cigarette and added: \u201cI better hope so or I\u2019m fucked.\u201d", "description": "It came to me in the wide, swishy passenger seat of Jonathan Ward\u2019s 1949 Mercury hot rod.
