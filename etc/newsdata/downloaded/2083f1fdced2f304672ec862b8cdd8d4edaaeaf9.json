The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.2%.\n\nThough stocks paused Friday, U.S. stocks have drifted higher in recent sessions as earnings results poured in, pushing the S&P 500 toward a third consecutive week of gains and just a hair from its record high hit back in July.\n\nInvestors continued to look to corporate results for broader cues on the health of the economy, driving bigger swings in individual stocks than in the broader market.\n\nShares in Amazon.com dropped 3.5% after the tech giant reported a 26% fall in profit as it invested heavily to speed up shipping times.\n\nIntel raised its outlook for the year Thursday after it posted an increase in third-quarter earnings, sending its shares 6.2% higher in early trading.\n\nCharter Communications rose 5% after the cable company's third-quarter profit fell less than expected and revenue beat forecasts.\n\nIn Europe, fresh economic data and corporate earnings continued to paint a mixed picture of how the biggest businesses in the region are doing.\n\nThe pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged 0.3% lower, led by declines in the food and beverages sector. Anheuser-Busch InBev was the worst performer among those stocks, falling 8.4% in recent trading after the world's biggest brewer cut its earnings outlook for the full year.\n\nThe outlook for growth and inflation in the eurozone over the coming years was lowered by forecasters surveyed by the European Central Bank. Adding to the subdued economic outlook, market-research group GfK said German consumer sentiment is set to worsen in November, while business expectations in the country improved slightly, according to the Ifo Institute.\n\n\"We are still waiting for a proper rebound\" in economic growth in Germany, said Inga Fechner, an economist at ING. Business sentiment remains weak amid worrying signs from the country's services sector, she added.\n\nRussia's central bank on Friday cut rates by half a percentage point -- the fourth cut since June and the largest to date -- highlighting the risk of a global economic slowdown.\n\nThe British pound dropped 0.3% against the U.S. dollar, after earlier having recovered from an even sharper drop Thursday evening. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for a snap general election on Dec. 12 in an effort to pressure his political opponents to back his Brexit deal. The 10-year U.K. gilt yield rose to 0.645% in recent trading, from 0.627%\n\n\"The continued uncertainty over Brexit is hanging over markets today,\" said CMC Markets analyst David Madden.\n\nOn Friday, the University of Michigan issues the final results of its October consumer sentiment survey. Preliminary results showed U.S. consumers were feeling more positive in early October but were still cautious. Earlier in the month retail sales figures showed that consumers pulled back on spending in September.\n\nGunjan Banerji contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Max Bernhard at Max.Bernhard@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 25, 2019 10:07 ET (14:07 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
