I love my country and I won\u2019t allow her to receive any defamation or violation,\u201d one person posted on China\u2019s Twitter-like platform Weibo.\n\n\u201cWhoever buys their products is blind,\u201d another post read.\n\nTiffany\u2019s CEO Alessandro Bogliolo said in August that continuous business disruptions in Hong Kong had impacted the company, estimating six full selling days were lost due to unplanned store closures during the second quarter of this year.\n\nBogliolo said the city was the brand\u2019s fourth-largest market by sales \u2014 after the US, Japan and mainland China.\n\nNew York-based Tiffany opened its largest-ever product exhibition in Shanghai in September, a move it hoped would attract young Chinese customers.\n\nThe company\u2019s sales grew more than 25 percent in mainland China between March and June \u2014 a stark contrast to a three-percent drop in the company\u2019s global turnover in the same period.\n\nTiffany has 35 shops in mainland China, and plans to open branches of its Blue Box Cafe in Hong Kong and Shanghai.", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 Tiffany & Co. have removed a tweet showing a woman covering one eye after Chinese consumers accused the jeweller of supporting", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/64b2af_tiffany-co-removed-tweet-showing-woman-covering-one-eye-chinese-consumers-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
