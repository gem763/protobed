Some math problems have been challenging us for centuries, and while brain-busters like the ones that follow may seem impossible, someone is bound to solve \u2018em eventually. Maybe.\n\nFor now, take a crack at the toughest math problems known to man, woman, and machine.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/byBvSllNN7Kf4y7Ph586Fw--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/b85f2f1d01e0967ce1d7d8abc3d62817", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
