In July, Ankara sent a ship, Yavuz, to drill close to the Cypriot shore in an area that had already been licensed to French company, TOTAL, and Italian company, ENI, for drilling. It was the second Turkish ship to drill close to Cyprus.\n\nPompeo spoke about \"rules\" governing energy exploration in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n\"We\u2019ve told the Turks that illegal drilling is unacceptable and we\u2019ll continue to take diplomatic actions to ensure that lawful activity takes place,\" he said. \"No country can hold Europe hostage.\"\n\nPompeo was in Greece to renew an updated defense cooperation pact between Washington and Athens. The deal allows for a stronger US military presence in central and northern Greece, and its renewal is seen as a sign of the continued US interest in the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nHowever, his visit was also met by protests from Greek leftist parties unhappy about the pact. They marched to the American embassy and waved banners that said \u201cPompeo go home\u201d. There were minor scuffles between protesters and police.", "description": "Pompeo condemns Turkey over drilling in Cypriot waters", "authors": ["Heather Donald"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/88/10/1000x563_cmsv2_b83042b9-21b9-5c7e-ab39-0c1100cc904c-4208810.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
