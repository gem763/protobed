And America says that it will lift the sanctions,\u201d Rouhani said on his official website, according to Reuters. \u201cIt was up for debate what sanctions will be lifted and they (the United States) had said clearly that we will lift all sanctions.\u201d (CNBC)\n\nThe White House very quickly disputed that charge.\n\nStatement from Hogan Gidley: \u201cThis is a flat out lie. Rouhani wanted President Trump to remove the sanctions and end the maximum pressure campaign, and the president told them \u2018No, absolutely not.\u2019 https://t.co/GEqEsgosaS \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) September 27, 2019\n\nAnd President Trump confirmed it.\n\nIran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them in order to meet. I said, of course, NO! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019\n\nIn fact, just last week Trump ordered a new round of sanctions against the regime after obtaining evidence that it bombed a major Saudi Arabian oil field.\n\n\"These are the strongest sanctions ever put on the country,\" Trump said. \"We are at a level of sanction that is far greater than ever before with respect to Iran.\"\n\nThe sanctions hit Iran\u2019s Central Bank and its National Development Fund, and Iran-based company Etemad Tejarat Pars.\n\nThe regime denies having orchestrated the bombing, but the State Department says all the evidence points in one direction.\n\n\"In a failed attempt to disrupt the global economy, the Islamic Republic of Iran attacked the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\" the State Department said in a press release. \"This act of aggression was sophisticated in its planning and brazen in its execution. Regardless of transparent attempts to shift blame, the evidence points to Iran\u2014and only Iran.\"", "description": ".09/27/2019 10:56:00AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/169/ca31c801-16c5-4309-9359-56c394cbdc4a.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
