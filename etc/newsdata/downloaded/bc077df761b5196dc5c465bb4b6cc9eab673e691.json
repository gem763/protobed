The blaze in North Kensington, west London, claimed 72 lives in June 2017.\n\nPeople living in high-rise properties are currently told that it is usually safer to stay in their flat if there is a blaze elsewhere in their block, because it is assumed the building\u2019s design and construction will stop the fire spreading. They are recommended to call 999 for advice. The Grenfell fire inquiry has heard that the \u2018stay put\u2019 advice was only officially abandoned almost two hours after the first 999 call.\n\nMiss Cotton issued her call when she presented a progress report on the lessons learned to a London Assembly committee.\n\nHer comments follow calls from the London Fire Brigade for the Government to update building regulations to prevent fires similar to the Grenfell disaster\n\n\u2018Fire spread the entire height of Grenfell Tower in less than 30 minutes,\u2019 she said. \u2018Residents and firefighters were placed in impossible conditions we had never experienced before.\n\n\u2018That is why I am calling for the Government to reverse more than 20 years of neglect in relation to fire safety and to undertake urgent research on \u201cbuildings that fail\u201d, which means \u201cstay put\u201d advice is no longer viable in those buildings.\u2019\n\nBut Miss Cotton noted that since 2014 there had been more than 5,000 high rise fires in London, with \u2018stay put \u2018advice being effective in the \u2018vast majority\u2019 of incidents.", "description": "Dany Cotton noted that since 2014 there had been more than 5,000 high rise fires in London, with 'stay put' advice being effective in the 'vast majority' of incidents.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/21/19806230-0-image-a-59_1571258069108.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
