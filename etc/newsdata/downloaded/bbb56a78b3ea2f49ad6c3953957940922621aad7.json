And this ritual might be more for the mother\u2019s benefit than the baby\u2019s. Rituals are often created for times of enormous stress, says Nick Hobson, a psychologist and consultant who studies rituals. Take wintertime, whose depressing dreariness we zhuzh up with candles and presents during the holidays. Similarly, \u201cpregnancy and labor is basically an exercise in managing massive amounts of stress and uncertainty,\u201d Hobson says. Gender reveals lend structure and order to the chaos, helping parents manage their stress. You don\u2019t know how your delivery is going to go, but you know one thing: It\u2019s a girl, and everyone was so happy to hear it.\n\nFlorence Pasche Guignard, a religious-studies instructor at Ryerson University, watched hundreds of videos of gender reveals for her 2015 study on the topic, \u201cA Gendered Bun in the Oven.\u201d She notes that there is otherwise a stark lack of pregnancy-related rituals in North American culture. A baby might get baptized and Christened, but pregnant women mostly get told not to drink wine or eat soft cheese. They\u2019re frequently advised to buy baby stuff and read baby books\u2014for the good of the baby. Gender-reveal products can certainly play into that industry by giving women even more stuff to buy, but a special ceremony to celebrate the pregnancy itself also can help fill that void.", "description": "", "authors": ["Olga Khazan", "Theatlantic.Com Health Archive Surprise-Its-A-Gender-Reveal"], "top_image": ""}
