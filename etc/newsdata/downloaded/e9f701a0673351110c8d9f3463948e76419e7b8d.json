The Middlesbrough-based pawnbroking, jewellery and foreign exchange chain last week announced a one-off \u00a3600,000 profit from selling gold jewellery to be melted down.\n\nThe move was timed to take advantage of current strong gold prices, and brokers responded with enthusiasm.\n\nMidas recommended Ramsdens shares in December last year, when they were \u00a31.66. They closed last week at \u00a31.94, having briefly topped \u00a32 on the day chief executive Peter Kenyon revealed his neat little gold sale.\n\nRamsdens made a one-off \u00a3600,000 profit from selling gold jewellery to be melted down\n\nKenyon also said that the company was trading well, despite difficult conditions on the high street.\n\nRamsdens is less exposed to the tough economic environment than many shops because it sells a wide range of goods, from second-hand jewellery to holiday cash, and runs a thriving pawn business too.\n\nThe group is on the lookout for acquisitions, which should boost growth over time. Analysts forecast a 14 per cent increase in turnover to \u00a353.6million for the year to March 31, 2020, and an 18 per cent rise in underlying pre-tax profits to \u00a37.9million, including the one-off gain.\n\nThe dividend is expected to climb 3 per cent to 7.4p, putting the stock on a yield of almost 4 per cent.\n\nFurther increases are pencilled in for 2021 and beyond.\n\nMidas recommended Ramsdens shares in December last year, when they were \u00a31.66\n\nMidas verdict: The retail sector has been filled with profit warnings, shop closures and other tales of woe. Ramsdens seems to be holding its own. Its high street customers are loyal and it has a small but fast-growing online business selling jewellery and foreign currency.\n\nRamsdens\u2019 product range and ambition may continue to shield the business from some of the problems affecting the high street. But, with economic conditions weakening, shareholders have a right to feel cautious.\n\nHaving enjoyed a 17 per cent increase in the share price since last year, they may choose to sell half their stock and bank some gains. They can then keep the rest and hope that Kenyon continues to deliver.", "description": "Midas recommended Ramsdens shares in December last year, when they were \u00a31.66.
