It\u2019s a paradox with which Americans are grappling,\u201d the editorial said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest lesson which can be drawn from the matter is that entities that value commercial interests must make their members speak cautiously.\u201d\n\nIn his first public comments on the controversy, Silver late Monday spoke in support of freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cI think as a values-based organization that I want to make it clear\u2026 that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression,\u201d Silver told Japan\u2019s Kyodo News agency.\n\n\u201cThere are the values that have been part of this league from its earliest days, and that includes free expression,\u201d he added, speaking in Japan, where the Rockets and Toronto Raptors play several exhibition games this week.\n\nHowever the NBA\u2019s initial statement in English on the furore said it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that Morey\u2019s views had \u201coffended so many of our friends and fans in China\u201d.\n\nA Chinese-language version of the statement went further, saying the organisation was \u201cdeeply disappointed by the inappropriate remarks\u201d.\n\nIn the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Texan, deemed the NBA\u2019s initial statements an \u201cembarrassment.\u201d\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican, also accused the NBA of throwing Morey \u201cunder the bus\u201d to \u201cprotect (the) NBA\u2019s market access in China\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is bigger than just the @NBA. It\u2019s about #China\u2019s growing ability to restrict freedom of expression here in the US,\u201d he added in a series of tweets.\n\nAnd Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, warned \u201cno one should implement a gag rule on Americans speaking out for freedom\u201d.", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 China on Tuesday pulled NBA exhibition games from television screens as the league faced an escalating punishment campaign in the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/d6b462_nba-commissioner-adam-silver-has-pressure-speak-out-strongly-in-defence-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
