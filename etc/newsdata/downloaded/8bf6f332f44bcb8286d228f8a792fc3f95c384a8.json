The test does not allow the usual privileges of being born in India to parents born in India, plus simple paperwork. \u201cNone of the above\u201d is the usual answer, because how else do you make life as difficult as possible for those whom you want to segregate and crush, except with impossible rules and arcane paperwork?\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), when it came to power in 2014 under prime minister Narendra Modi, promised to complete the National Register of Citizens (NRC) process, long in cold storage for the very reason we see around us now. The BJP however, unlike others who used NRC at election time only, wanted to provoke the incipient hatred of religious minorities and Muslims in particular, that wins it electoral dividends.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe problems left behind by British colonial rule in the north east of India were exacerbated by migration into these areas in the Partition of 1947 and the Bangladesh War of Independence in 1971. But, and the but is a big but, the numbers of these so-called migrations were always open to question. They grew or shrank depending on which side of the argument you were standing. Some aspects of the \u201canti\u201d argument were the usual, if false, distrust and anger with migrants, who took away jobs from locals and so on. The other, more dangerous, aspect was that this anger was directed mainly at Bangladeshis, for being Muslim. Several governments of other political dispensations made promises to the people of Assam to remove illegal immigrants, but only this Modi-led BJP government took it further.\n\nAmit Shah, now Union Home minister of India, referred to Bangladeshis as \u201ctermites\u201d who had to be eradicated. There were over 40 million of them, he said. The final result, after all the heartbreaks and the hoops, has revealed a total of 1.9 million \u201cillegals\u201d, a formidable figure as far as personal and social tragedy is concerned, but a minuscule number when you compare it to the build-up and the outpouring of hatred. It is important to remember that these are people who have lived in India for decades and have now been stripped of their identity for petty political gain. And, that Bangladesh does not accept these people as theirs, which makes them both homeless and stateless.\n\nThe result is that India now joins a contemptible list of nations which has no qualms about repeating the horrors of the 20th century and putting large groups of people into concentration camps or detention centres or \u201cre-education\u201d camps, as China has done to Uighur Muslims. Or Donald Trump\u2019s version of the USA has done with all illegals, but mainly Hispanic. For those who find it acceptable to round up some humans and incarcerate them for their religion or the colour of their skin in times of war, one need not look further than the Holocaust. To do it in peacetime in the 21st century speaks only to the worst sort of regressive authoritarian bigotry and cruelty.\n\nThe current cycle that the world is spinning through suggests that there will not be enough voices to speak out against what\u2019s happening in India. Trump may take China on when it comes to trade tariffs, but not Uighur \u201cre-education\u201d camps. China is just too big. Almost no one else has spoken out for the Uighurs so you can forget India\u2019s new entry into this deplorable list. Every world leader makes statements about the threats of Islamist fundamentalism but has no qualms about staying on the right side of the Saudi Royals. Palestine, once a beacon for all liberal movements, is practically forgotten. Only the United Nations has categorically spoken up against India\u2019s NRC.\n\nThere is a global sort of Islamophobia. And there is the deep, prejudiced and false \u201cvictimhood\u201d of India\u2019s religious majority which thrives on the hatred of Muslims. Not all of India\u2019s 80 per cent Hindu population perhaps, but enough to applaud the incarceration of people because of their Muslim religion.\n\nAnd given the voiceless-ness of India\u2019s Muslims in the current dispensation in India, these detention centres will be shamelessly be ignored by a populace largely in turmoil over a collapsing economy. Unless there\u2019s a miracle in the offing, this round has been won by hatred.", "description": "There\u2019s a little test that you can do on the internet to prove whether you are an Indian citizen or not, based on the National Register of Citizens, being applied by law in the state of Assam.", "authors": ["Ranjona Banerji"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/10/13/assam-detention-camp-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
