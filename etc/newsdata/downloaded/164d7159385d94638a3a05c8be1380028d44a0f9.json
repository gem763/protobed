While some systems are simple and straightforward, the worst systems highlight a more serious issue. The use of handheld devices while driving was outlawed for good reason \u2014 focusing on the phone and not the road ahead can have serious ramifications.\n\nTrying to work with a truculent infotainment system is no less distracting.\n\nThankfully, the integration of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto allows a fast and efficient way to access a smartphone\u2019s key features with less distraction. Sadly, not all infotainment systems work with both formats \u2014 Mini and Toyota, to name two, only work with CarPlay.\n\nThe Best\n\nChrysler Uconnect\n\nChrysler\u2019s Uconnect system, which is also found in Dodge, Fiat, Jeep and Ram products, is the clear winner. It has bright graphics, quick response times and the menus are self-explanatory. In the same way, pairing a phone is as easy as easy gets, as is accessing Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. On the performance models, like Charger, there are extra menus that offer things like the ability to record acceleration times.\n\nThe on-screen climate control functions are not the easiest to use, but given the redundant controls, this is less of an issue. One neat feature is the Uconnect mobile app. It does everything from allowing the driver to lock/unlock the car and remote-start it; to toy with the Send N\u2019 Go feature, which allows the driver to send an address from their phone to the car, where it is loaded into the navigation system.\n\nIf there is a nit, it is the Ram\u2019s 12-inch vertical touchscreen. There is such a thing as too big \u2014 when close to a large body of water, two-thirds of the screen shows nothing but blue!\n\nBMW iDrive\n\nAfter a very rocky start where the system\u2019s designer managed to get lost while trying to demonstrate BMW\u2019s then-new iDrive system, it has been dumbed down and smartened up at the same time. The layout is clean and uncluttered, it\u2019s fast to react to input and Apple CarPlay is accessible through Bluetooth \u2014 nearly all others require the phone to be hard-wired. The problem is while CarPlay is free for the first three years, it costs thereafter, which needs to change.\n\nAs with Mini, BMW owners are out of luck when it comes to Android Auto. The majority of functions are accessed through a rotary jog wheel, which is simple and straightforward to use. The latest systems now have a touchscreen and recognize simple hand gestures \u2014 rotating one\u2019s index finger in a clockwise direction ahead of the screen turns the audio volume up. BMW is also introducing its Intelligent Personal Assistant. The advanced voice-recognition system responds quickly. Simply say \u201cHey, BMW, I\u2019m cold\u201d and the climate control ratchets up the temperature accordingly.\n\nSubaru StarLink\n\nThe latest versions of Subaru\u2019s StarLink system have been improved and now come with a number of screen sizes, including the 11.6-inch multi-gesture capacitive touchscreen with Wi-Fi hotspot found in the new Legacy and Outback. The fast processors deliver lag-free performance and the screens have clear menus and icons that ease operation. Subaru has made Apple CarPlay and Android Auto standard on nearly all of its models \u2014 the BRZ and its Toyota sibling being the exception.\n\nStarLink also uses simple voice commands to control features like the navigation system. The latter represents the lone nit. The TomTom-based navigation system is not as good as many other built-in nav systems or Google maps. StarLink Connected Services includes automatic collision notification, roadside assistance and stolen vehicle locator along with lock/unlock and remote start functions.\n\nOther systems worthy of making the Best list include Audi\u2019s MMI Touch Response (pictured above). It is quick and easy to use and it is the only other system, Mini excepted, to allow Apple CarPlay to be used via Bluetooth. Chevrolet\u2019s MyLink has first-rate graphics, speedy reactions and user-friendly menus. The Hyundai and Kia systems get thumbs up for reaction speed and the simplicity of operation. VW\u2019s system is fast and hides the icons until the head unit senses a hand. This feature opens up more usable on-screen space when the icons are not needed.\n\nThe Worst\n\nFord Sync\n\nEarly versions of Ford\u2019s Sync system, which ran on Microsoft-based software, were difficult to use and as slow as the proverbial snail. The newer Sync3 systems are faster and certainly more intuitive. The top-end is found in the new Explorer \u2014 it offers a well-crafted 10.1-inch touchscreen with a clean layout. One plus is when your home Wi-Fi network is within range, Sync3 can use it to upgrade the software.\n\nHowever, it still has some big nits. The Home icon is buried in the top-left corner of the screen. In many cases it is too small and easily missed at the first attempt. A button on the steering wheel beside the voice control button would work wonders. At times the system can be painfully slow to respond after initial start-up.\n\nThe bigger issue is when a smartphone with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto is connected to the head unit, the built-in native navigation system cannot be used. This forces the driver to use the phone\u2019s navigation system and pay the associated data costs; or disconnect the phone and lose the key benefits of CarPlay/Auto. The same applies to Lincoln systems.\n\nLand Rover\n\nLand Rover\u2019s infotainment systems differ in name and format. Some use a single screen while others use two 10-inch touchscreens. The upper screen looks after the media and phone functions. The lower screen gives access to climate and seat controls. While the setup looks impressive, the various systems have the same issues. It takes a longer-than-expected time for the system to boot up and it lags when switching between functions and menus.\n\nLikewise, the sub-menus are less than intuitive. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are slowly coming on line in 2019 models. Upgrading an earlier system is possible, but this ability is limited and based on the individual system. The combination makes everyday operation more of a chore than it really needs to be. These comments apply equally to Jaguar\u2019s infotainment system.\n\nHonourable worst mentions go to Nissan for the dated look and lack of modern connectivity features in many of its vehicles. Acura\u2019s infotainment systems are also starting to look dated, they have so-so graphics and the steering wheel and centre stack are festooned with knobs, dials and buttons, which add unnecessary confusion.", "description": "The quality of the software behind those touchscreens in the middle of your dashboard really runs the gamut \u2014 we nail down which automakers have got it right, and which flopped", "authors": ["Hours Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/main6.jpg?quality=80", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
