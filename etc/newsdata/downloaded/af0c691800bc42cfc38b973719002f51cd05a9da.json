I\u2019m definitely going to evaluate who we hire as the GM and who we pick up on the team. All that plays a factor.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Wizards announced that Tommy Sheppard would officially take over for Grunfeld, and on Thursday, the first-time general manager scored the first major victory of his young tenure. Beal, after weighing a standing offer for the past three months, signed a two-year, $72 million extension that will keep him in Washington through 2022.\n\nFor Sheppard, who is leading a new and unconventional front office through a rebuild, the agreement carries significant symbolic weight and practical benefits.\n\nSo much of modern professional basketball boils down to recruiting, catering to and appeasing star players. Look no further than the San Antonio Spurs before and after Kawhi Leonard or the Cleveland Cavaliers before and after LeBron James. Executives are often forced to be marketers for their owners, franchises, cities and facilities while confronting a playing field that isn\u2019t level.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSheppard couldn\u2019t sell 12 months of sunshine, a track record of winning or even one of the NBA\u2019s 20 most talented rosters. What he could sell to Beal was loyalty, the comforts of home, a central role in the franchise\u2019s thinking and a vision for how best to execute an inevitable turnaround. And, of course, $72 million worth of extra financial security.\n\nThat pitch proved successful, and the pitchman deserves serious credit. During an offseason in which the Wizards made few moves of consequence, Sheppard got the organization\u2019s most important piece of business done when conventional wisdom strongly suggested that Beal would wait until next summer before committing.\n\nBeal\u2019s extension changes the dynamic of a Wizards season that probably will end with another lottery trip. Washington figured to be swamped by Beal rumors before the February trade deadline, with a long list of aspiring contenders potentially viewing him as the piece to put them over the top and one of the few available stars after such a busy summer. Instead, the Wizards should spend much of this season under the national radar. Beal can\u2019t be legally traded until next summer, so the speculators are temporarily out of business.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat will be good and healthy for a young Wizards roster that needs a stable centerpiece. Getting the most out of developing prospects requires finding the right lineups and responsibilities, but also maintaining a high level of buy-in throughout an 82-game schedule. For an organization with an extensive history of culture problems, Beal\u2019s commitment should go a long way toward keeping the house in order.\n\nLocking up Beal only helps the Wizards\u2019 difficult position with John Wall, who is expected to miss the entire season as he recovers from an Achilles\u2019 injury. Wall has publicly requested another chance to play with Beal, his longtime backcourt partner, once he returns to the court, and the Wizards have stood by him during his rehabilitation. Given that Wall is just beginning a four-year, $170 million contract, they have little choice.\n\nRemoving the possibility of a Beal trade sets up a scenario in which Wall and Beal could play together in 2020-21 and 2021-22, giving Wall sufficient time to recover from a career-altering surgery. Alternatively, Beal\u2019s presence also sets up Sheppard to explore Wall trades down the road knowing that he has a foundational, fan-friendly piece in place to manage the transition and keep the team afloat on the court.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is one final, obvious benefit to taking care of Beal early, although it\u2019s a bit of a third-rail topic. Wizards owner Ted Leonsis is on record as saying his team will \u201cnever, ever tank\u201d \u2014 a hard-line stance that can make a rebuilding effort even more difficult. Last season, Beal played all 82 games and logged 40 or more minutes 22 times, even though Washington was not a serious threat to make the playoffs at the end of the year.\n\nThose unnecessary miles add up, and both Beal and the Wizards would have been better served by taking a less aggressive approach to March and early April. If the franchise finds itself in the same position five months from now, Beal\u2019s signed contract theoretically makes it easier for both sides to agree to play for draft lottery Ping-Pong balls.\n\nTo be clear, Sheppard still has a long list of complications: His vision is heavily reliant upon rookie Rui Hachimura hitting it big, he will be handcuffed by Wall\u2019s contract for the foreseeable future, and he will have his hands full trying to convince difference-makers to come play with Beal next summer in free agency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose are serious challenges but nothing compared to what life would have been like with Beal at the center of a trade feeding frenzy.\n\nMore NBA coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "In selling Beal on his plans for the team, Washington's new GM scored the first big victory of his young tenure.", "authors": ["Ben Golliver", "Nba Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4-cmKyfWKtTdpTrZdIQP7VhrMr4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TSC3CRXYAMI6RBSCZFYYUJLMXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
