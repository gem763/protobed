Its Xenowatch tracker collates media reports as well as information from activists, victims and observers.\n\nThreats, attacks and killings against foreigners in South Africa\n\nIt suggests violent attacks peaked in 2008 and again in 2015.\n\nIn 2008, there was a wave of attacks across the country against refugees and migrants - more than 60 people were reported to have been killed and thousands displaced.\n\nIn 2015, there were outbreaks of violence against non-South Africans, mostly in the cities of Durban and Johannesburg, which led to the deployment of the army to deter further unrest.\n\nIn March, the government launched an initiative to raise public awareness and improve access to services for victims of discrimination.\n\nHuman rights groups welcomed it, but said that the government needed to publicly recognise attacks on foreigners as xenophobic.\n\nIn a statement published in October 2018, South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, blamed the governing ANC party for a \"scourge of xenophobic violence\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Foreign minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, has urged the police to act against people targeting foreigners\n\nWhere are the migrants from?\n\nAbout 70% of foreigners in South Africa come from neighbouring Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Lesotho.\n\nThe remaining 30% is made up of people from Malawi, UK, Namibia, eSwatini, previously known as Swaziland, India and other countries.\n\nThere are an estimated 3.6 million migrants in the country, a spokesperson for South Africa's national statistics body told the BBC, out of an overall population of well over 50 million.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The wave of attacks has prompted a number of initiatives to tackle discrimination\n\nHow do different regions compare?\n\nGauteng province, which includes South Africa's largest city Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria, has the highest rate of violence against foreign nationals, followed by the Western Cape, according to the ACMS. KwaZulu-Natal, where Durban is situated, is third.\n\nAttacks have mainly taken place in large cities, but they have also been reported in smaller towns and rural areas.\n\nThe violence is often triggered by local disputes, with migrants being accused of taking jobs away from South Africans.\n\nForeign-run shops have been looted and destroyed.\n\nSouth Africa attacks Xenophobic violence incidents by Province, 1994-2018 Gauteng 212 Western Cape 111 KwaZulu-Natal 67 Limpopo 40 Eastern Cape 33 Mpumalanga 22 North West 20 Free State 19 Northern Cape 5\n\nThe country has experienced poor economic performance, with officially recorded unemployment at more than 27% at the end of last year.\n\nAnd more widely, the country has one of the highest murder rates in the world.\n\n\"The causes are poverty and has its roots in apartheid,\" says Sharon Ekambaram, who runs the refugee and migrant rights programme for Lawyers for Human Rights.\n\nWhat do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?
