Photo: Burak Kara/Getty Images\n\nShortly after speaking to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday, Donald Trump endorsed a Turkish incursion into Syria. \u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into northern Syria,\u201d the White House said in a statement. \u201cThe United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial \u2018Caliphate,\u2019 will no longer be in the immediate area.\u201d\n\nThis was an elliptical way of announcing that America was abandoning its Kurdish allies to their fate. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces had played a leading role in retaking northeastern Syria from ISIS. Since then, they had assumed guardianship of thousands of ISIS prisoners and established a nascent socialist society in the newly autonomous region (in an odd coincidence, the contemporary Kurdish version of socialism, like the American one, derives from the teachings of an eccentric Vermonter).\n\nThe Kurds in Syria have maintained ties to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which has been waging a separatist insurgency in Turkey for decades. For this reason, Erdogan regards the emergence of a Kurdish society on his nation\u2019s border as an intolerable security threat. Turkey\u2019s \u201clong-planned operation into northern Syria\u201d is a long-planned operation to destroy America\u2019s staunchest (and most progressive) allies in the war on ISIS.\n\nTrump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds provoked an extraordinarily broad backlash with America\u2019s European allies, Pentagon officials, State Department aides, Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, Liz Cheney, and the editorial board of Jacobin all united in opposition to the move. The president produced a variety of contradictory defenses in response. On Monday, he said, \u201cThe United States does not endorse [Turkey\u2019s] attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea.\u201d Then, on Twitter, Trump made a tacit case for letting Turkey have its way in northeast Syria on the grounds that the country has been such a swell ally; shortly thereafter, he warned he would \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey\u201d if Erdogan\u2019s government did \u201canything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits.\u201d\n\nAs Turkish media began airing bombings of border towns on Wednesday and the Syrian Democratic Forces reported airstrikes on civilian areas, some wondered whether such bloodshed was within the limits imposed by Trump\u2019s wisdom. But a senior adviser to Erdogan told CNN Wednesday afternoon that it was, saying, \u201cPresident Trump and President Erdogan have reached an understanding over precisely what this operation is.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent press conference, Trump did not contradict that claim. Although the president had threatened to destroy the Turkish economy if Turkey were to \u201cwipe out\u201d the Kurds, he expressed fatalism about the day\u2019s violence. Of the Turks and Kurds, Trump said, \u201cThey\u2019ve wanted to fight, and that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\n\nThe president went on to offer the faintest possible praise of our erstwhile allies.\n\nTrump on the Kurds: \"They didn't help us in the Second World War, they didn't help us with Normandy.\" He says they're only interested in fighting for \"their land.\" He adds, \"With all of that being said, we like the Kurds.\" \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) October 9, 2019\n\nWhen asked about the threat that ISIS fighters will use the Turkish invasion as an opportunity to escape from Kurdish prisons, Trump assured the American people that the terrorists would merely descend upon Europe.\n\nTrump indicates he's not worried about ISIS fighters escaping northern Syria because if they do they'll just end up in Europe pic.twitter.com/cBsbXQxjsg \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 9, 2019\n\nIt is worth noting amid all this that our president has a multimillion-dollar personal interest in maintaining the favor of Turkey\u2019s government (although we do not know the precise value of his business partnerships in Istanbul because he will not let us see his tax returns).\n\nAlmost makes one wonder whether Trump is actually fit for the extraordinary responsibilities of his office.", "description": "As Turkish bombs fall on Kurdish border towns on Wednesday, President Recep Erdogan\u2019s government insisted that Trump knew precisely the scope of its planned attack in northeastern Syria.
