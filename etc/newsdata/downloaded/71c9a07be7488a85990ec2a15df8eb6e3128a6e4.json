PINS, +0.66% are up 0.5% in midday trading Wednesday after Pivotal Research Group analyst Michael Levine upgraded the stock to buy from hold, writing of a more attractive entry point following Pinterest's lock-up expiration earlier this week and a general pullback in high-growth names. Levine wrote that while the lock-up overhang could continue to pressure Pinterest's stock over the next few days, there's already been some relief. From a thematic standpoint, Levine also argues that Pinterest is currently in the best quarter for advertising and could benefit from weak television ratings that are driving ad dollars over to web players. He kept his $32 target price intact. Pinterest's stock has fallen 12% in the past month, as the S&P 500 SPX, -0.20% has dropped 0.4%.", "description": "Shares of Pinterest Inc. are up 0.5% in midday trading Wednesday after Pivotal Research Group analyst Michael Levine upgraded the stock to buy from hold,...", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
