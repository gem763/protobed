Day was alone in third place.\n\nDay is hoping Els will chose him as a captain's pick for the International team against the Tiger Woods-captained U.S. team in December at Royal Melbourne.\n\n\"Overall, it's a great start,\" Day said. \"I'm excited for the rest of the week.\"\n\nHe said before his first round that he was still hoping for a Presidents Cup spot.\n\n\"It is certainly disappointing not to make the team on my own merits. But it is a reminder that nothing is given to you in this game,\" Day said.\n\n\"I certainly want to be on the team and believe I can be an asset to the Internationals. Being in my home country certainly gives me an edge and I've had some success on the sand-belt (courses) and Royal Melbourne in the past.\"\n\nDefending champion Brooks Koepka shot a 69 with an eagle on the 18th, his final hole, Last year's runner-up Gary Woodland had a 71.\n\nJustin Thomas, who won the inaugural 2017 CJ Cup, shot 68 and Phil Mickelson and Jordan Spieth each shot 70. Spieth is looking to end a lengthy drought \u2014 he hasn't won since the 2017 British Open at Royal Birkdale, a span of 54 tournaments worldwide.\n\n\"Overall a good way to start. I felt I played a lot better than my score,\" Thomas said. \"Anytime you play where you've won before, it creates a lot of good memories.\"\n\nKevin Na, who won in a playoff in Las Vegas two weeks ago, had a 72 and Sergio Garcia shot 73.\n\nThere are 78 players in the no-cut, limited-field event.\n\nThe top-ranked Koepka stirred some controversy on Wednesday when he pointed out that Rory McIlroy, his closest challenger for the No. 1 ranking, hasn't won a major since the American joined the PGA Tour in 2015. He was responding to a question about a rivalry between the pair.\n\n\"I'm not looking at anybody behind me. I'm No. 1 in the world,\" Koepka said. \"I've got open road in front of me. I'm not looking in the rearview mirror, so I don't see it as a rivalry. I've been out here for, what, five years. Rory hasn't won a major since I've been on the PGA Tour.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
