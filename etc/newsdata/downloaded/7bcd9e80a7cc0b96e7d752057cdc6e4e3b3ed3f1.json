The ball was neatly played behind the defence by Nicolas Pepe for Alexandre Lacazette to smash past Hugo Lloris just a minute before half-time.\n\nThe second-half was very much one-way traffic as Arsenal sought an equaliser, and inevitably is came when Mateo Guendouzi played a floated ball for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to poke home.\n\nArsenal thought they had a third, when Sokratis bundled in Sead Kolasinac\u2019s fiercely-hit ball across the box, but the linesman correctly ruled it out as the Bosnian defender was offside when he made his run down the left flank.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
