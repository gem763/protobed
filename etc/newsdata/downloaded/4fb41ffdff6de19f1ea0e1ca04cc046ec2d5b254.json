There\u2019s no rule of law anymore. We can only be united and protest.\u201d\n\nWhat began as opposition to a proposed extradition law, which could have seen people sent for trial in mainland courts, has grown into a broad pro-democracy movement and a serious challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nThe protesters are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city\u2019s affairs. China dismisses accusations it is meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up anti-China sentiment.\n\nAn anti-government protester wearing mask smashes a bureau of Bank of China during a demonstration after a government's ban on face masks under emergency law, at Mong Kok, in Hong Kong, China, October 4, 2019. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nMany protesters wear masks to hide their identity due to fears employers could face pressure to take action against them as companies walk a tightrope between the anti-government activists and the city\u2019s political masters in Beijing.\n\n\u201cAlmost all protesters wear masks, with the intention of hiding their identity. That\u2019s why they have become more unbridled,\u201d said Lam.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep the existing regulations idle and let violence escalate and the situation continue to deteriorate.\u201d\n\nLam described the territory as being in serious danger, but not in a state of emergency.\n\nPro-Beijing groups had been pushing for a mask ban, but it was not clear how the government would implement it in a city where many of its 7.4 million residents wear them every day to protect against infection following the outbreak of the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003.\n\n\u201cSOMETHING DRASTIC\u201d\n\nAuthorities had already loosened guidelines on the use of force by police, according to documents seen by Reuters.\n\nThat came just before an escalation in violence on Tuesday, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, when police fired about 1,800 volleys of tear gas, 900 rubber bullets and six live bullets - one of which hit an 18-year-old, the first time a protester had been hit be live fire.\n\nThe student, Tony Tsang, was shot at close range as he fought with a policeman. He is stable in hospital and has been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum 10-year sentence, and assaulting an officer.\n\nPro-democracy campaigners condemned Lam\u2019s latest decision.\n\nSlideshow (33 Images)\n\n\u201cThis is an ancient, colonial set of regulations, and you don\u2019t use them unless you can\u2019t legislate anymore,\u201d said Martin Lee, a veteran activist and one of the city\u2019s most prominent lawyers. \u201cOnce you start, there\u2019s no end to it.\u201d\n\nSome Hong Kong\u2019s businesses, struggling with a dip in tourism and retail sales due to the protests, gave the law a warmer welcome.\n\n\u201cI agree with it at this point,\u201d said businessman Allan Zeman, who is also an economic adviser to Lam. \u201cYou have to do something drastic to end the violence.\u201d", "description": "Hong Kong police shot and wounded a teenage boy on Friday, as violent protests erupted across the Chinese-ruled city hours after its embattled leader Carrie Lam invoked colonial-era emergency powers last used more than 50 years ago.", "authors": ["Clare Jim", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437200693&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF931RL", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
