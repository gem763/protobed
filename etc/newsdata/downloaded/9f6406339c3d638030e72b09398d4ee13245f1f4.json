This is his final tournament of an eventful year, in which he has proven himself capable of competing once again with the world\u2019s best players.\n\nNow that this essential fact has been established, the next questions surround Great Britain\u2019s upcoming team competitions \u2013 and indeed the Tokyo Olympics \u2013 where Murray could potentially resume his on-off doubles partnership with brother Jamie.\n\nIt was only 40 miles away, in Ghent, that the Murrays joined forces to help secure Great Britain\u2019s first Davis Cup in 79 years. At the Olympics, however, Andy and Jamie have fared notably less well. In three attempts, they have managed just a single victory, in the first round in Beijing 11 years ago. And as Andy admitted in Antwerp this week, there is an argument for not trying a fourth time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult one because last time when I played the Olympics I just wanted to play everything \u2013 singles, doubles, mixed,\u201d Murray said this week. \u201cNow I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do that.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a done deal that we will play together,\u201d Andy added. \u201cI mean he\u2019s been doing well with Neal [Skupski, the 29-year-old Liverpudlian who has partnered Jamie on a strong run of 20 wins from their last 28 matches]. And also if I played a match for example like I did with Alex de Minaur [in Zhuhai three weeks ago, lasting almost three hours], there\u2019s no chance I\u2019m playing doubles after that. I would be useless. I was so tired at the end.", "description": "Andy Murray\u2019s ATP singles season will end in Antwerp on Thursday night unless he can overcome world No 45 Pablo Cuevas.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000105083076-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqv3hxuICTza90rxjOncu1SL3vPOKTusd3feQ9v2tucJ0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
