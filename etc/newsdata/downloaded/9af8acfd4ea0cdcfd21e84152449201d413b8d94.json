The idea is that now, you\u2019ll simply search for whatever it is you\u2019re looking for, and then order it from wherever most makes sense, be it online, from a local store, or from retailers selling directly through Google.\n\nThere\u2019s also a new price tracker, which will let you track items you\u2019re looking for and ping you with a notification on your phone when the price drops (email notifications are also in the works for later this year).\n\nLastly, Google is expanding how Google Lens works when shopping for fashion items \u2014 now, when you upload or take a picture of an article of clothing, in addition to recommending similar items to buy, Google Shopping will show a new \u201cGet Style Inspiration\u201d menu. The new section shows off how other people around the internet are wearing the item you\u2019re searching for (and of course, offers links to buy the matching items in the outfit through Google).\n\nThe new Google Shopping features are available now in the US.", "description": "Google has launched a redesign of Google Shopping in the US across both the online and mobile sites, featuring a new personalized homepage, price tracking, and new Google Lens features for building outfits.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f4nwgf3Ev8omMAmMVQ6BhBTpKXE=/0x57:2120x1167/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19257514/Screen_Shot_2019_10_03_at_5.10.22_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
