For it would tell us a great deal about how we should deal with Turkey, now and in the future.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRomney then returned to the idea that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan might have given Trump an ultimatum that was met with acquiescence.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAre we so weak and inept diplomatically that Turkey forced the hand of the United States of America? Turkey!?\u201d Romney said. \u201cI believe that it\u2019s imperative that public hearings are held to answer these questions, and I hope the Senate is able to conduct those hearings next week.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, there have been suggestions that perhaps Trump got rolled by Erdogan, who has been pitching the idea that Turkey could take over the fight against ISIS in northern Syria for a long time. The possibility that Trump gave away the farm because Erdogan was particularly convincing or because of something else \u2014 Trump\u2019s business interests in Turkey, his desire for Middle East withdrawals, etc. \u2014 is a well-trafficked theory among Trump\u2019s opponents.\n\nAD\n\nBut here is a U.S. senator \u2014 and a Republican one \u2014 suggesting not just that Trump got out-negotiated, but that he basically got told what was going to happen and ran away. Romney is entertaining the idea that a relatively small country forced the hand of the United States and also dictated to the supposed dealmaker in chief.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s important to emphasize that this is speculation. But it\u2019s also not that far-fetched.\n\nTrump spoke with Erdogan the day he abruptly announced the withdrawal. He also may be entering his final year as president, and Turkey has long wanted to go after the Kurds in northern Syria. If you\u2019re Erdogan, you know that the next president almost definitely won\u2019t be so amenable to your plans for the region. You\u2019ve also been pitching this idea more softly for two years without getting your desired U.S. withdrawal. So why wouldn\u2019t you eventually play this card? It might be a bluff that Trump could call and you\u2019d come to regret, but it might also be your last, best chance to get a compliant U.S. president. And this is an issue of major emphasis for Turkey, which views Syria\u2019s Kurdish fighters as terrorists who constitute a clear and constant threat to it.\n\nAD\n\nRomney, at least, seems to think this indeed might have been what happened, and now he\u2019s calling for hearings on it. Other Trump critics have called for the release of what Trump and Erdogan said on that call, similar to the release of the call with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nThe White House certainly won\u2019t want to disclose what was said. But we\u2019ve seen with Ukraine that pressure can force disclosure. And at the very least, it seems fair to ask whether Turkey threatened to invade whether U.S. forces were there or not.\n\nAD", "description": "Romney suggested that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan might have given Trump an ultimatum  \u2014 and that Trump caved on withdrawing from Syria.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UHQ3dDCLFb8EvArAviRhUIEkDBA=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-17-2019/t_67c37abf8ce344f3be968fe06a7486a0_name_b53ac3c4_f119_11e9_bb7e_d2026ee0c199.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
