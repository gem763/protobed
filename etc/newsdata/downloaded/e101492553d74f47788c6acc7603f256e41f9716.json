Times. \u201cVery, very dry air coming in.\u201d\n\nAuthorities are worried the winds could hurl embers from the smoldering Getty Fire on the west side of Los Angeles and start new fires.\n\nAbout 9,000 people, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and LeBron James, remained under evacuation orders due to that blaze. City Councilman Mike Bonin said Tuesday that's because experts have analyzed the paths burned by two Santa Ana-spawned disasters \u2014 the 1961 Bel Air Fire and the 1978 Mandeville Canyon Fire.\n\nOfficials revealed Tuesday the Getty Fire was caused when a dry branch from a eucalyptus tree was flung 30 feet by high winds into a city Department of Water and Power line, which short-circuited and sparked, the utility and Fire Department announced Tuesday. The power line had been operating safely and the DWP had cut away brush and trees from around the line, officials said.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti called it an \"act of God.\"\n\nCALIFORNIA WILDFIRES: 700 NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS ACTIVATED\n\nAs winds are forecast to pick up in the south, they are expected to ease in the north where fire officials are battling what's currently the state's largest blaze.

About 90,000 buildings remained threatened with more than 150,000 people under evacuation orders.\n\nA timelapse video taken by ALERTWildFire camera atop Mount Saint Helena in California\u2019s Mayacamas Mountains shows the progress of the blaze from Monday to Tuesday as it continues to burn.
