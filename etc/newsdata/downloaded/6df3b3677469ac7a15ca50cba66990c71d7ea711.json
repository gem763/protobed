Are we looking at an apocalyptic cult or a social media publicity campaign, or maybe\u2014as seems likely\u2014a bit of both?\n\nRuinerwold is in the religious heartland of the Netherlands, in Dutch Bible Belt country. It is just a few miles from Staphorst, the religious center of the Orthodox Reformed Church, nicknamed 'the black stocking church\u2019 because of its rigid views of worldly life. People in the area live a modest, rural existence, religion is never far away, and many of the communities are known as kind and hospitable.\n\nThe sleepy little town with its friendly inhabitants has never been exposed to the kind of shock and chaos it is experiencing days after the police stormed a farmhouse and found an entire family, as it seemed, in hiding.\n\nA 58 year old man since identified as Josef B. was arrested outside the house after he refused to give them access. Inside, police found one older man and five young adults, four men and a woman, between the ages of 18 and 25, living in slapped-together quarters. Josef B. was detained and charged with kidnapping and endangerment of the health of others.\n\nThe tip that led to the police raid came when Chris Westerbeek, owner of the local Cafe De Kastelein called the police after a confused young man walked into his bar a couple of times last week. The first time the 25 year old came in, sat down and ordered five beers, then he quickly left.\n\nThen last Sunday he came in again and Westerbeek spoke to the local news station RTV Drenthe about it. In the interview he described the man as looking unkempt and disoriented. His hair was long, he had a small \u201cdirty beard\u201d and was wearing old clothes. Westerbeek tried talking to him: \u201c\u2018Hey, buddy, how did you get here?\u2019 I asked. The man admitted he ran away from a farmhouse nearby and needed help.\u201d He told the barman he had not been outside the constraints of his family\u2019s farmhouse for nine years.\n\n\u201cYou could tell he had no idea where he was and what he was doing,\u201d Westerbeek told RTV Drenthe. There were more younger brothers and a sister holed up in the house, but he said little else about what went on there.\n\nThe Daily Beast spoke to Westerbeek\u2019s mother, who said he has since \u201cgone into hiding\u201d because of the media frenzy. \u201cHe had to tell the same story over 40 times,\" she said. \u201cIt all became a little too much.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the Dutch and international press roaming the quiet green lanes and hanging out in the two local cafes trying to figure out what went on in the farmhouse. Villagers who had no idea about the occupants or their beliefs gather to find out what they can.\n\nThe villagers say they did know the detained Jozef B. a bit. They had nicknamed him \u201cthe Austrian,\u201d for his apparent nationality, and occasionally he would be seen loading up the trailer behind his Volvo with food and wood. He would drive it to the farm and then leave again, no-one knows where to.\n\nThe man was almost impossible to approach, Ruinerwold locals say. Neighbors would try, but he kept them away. Jans Keizer, a next door neighbour, told RTV Drenthe, \u201cI am shocked and ashamed, that something like that could happen on our road. I think everyone on this road is feeling guilty for not doing anything. We only saw the man\u2014he would wave when passing by in his big Volvo, but we would not speak.\u201d Years ago, at a first encounter, Keizer said, \u201cI was the one who gave him a traditional welcome, with wine and flowers, but when he took them, he said \u2018thank you\u2019 and went back in. There was no talking.\u201d They haven't spoken since.\n\nJosef B. was not the name of the person who rented the farm, and the owner of the property, a woman by the name of Alida Rooze appears to know very little about him. She was as oblivious to the fact a whole family was living there as the rest of the community. Rooze spoke to local newspaper Dagblad van het Noorden about it. \u201c We are speechless, that something like that happened in our house. We knew nothing at all. We rented out the house to one person several years ago, but are reading in the media that another man apparently lived there with children. We had no idea.\u201d Locals say Josef B. was seen in the past fixing the place up, and he built a big fence around it.", "description": "Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photos GettyAMSTERDAM\u2014The strange tale of a reclusive family in a small Dutch town grows curiouser and curiouser by the day.The first headlines at the beginning of the week said that in a remote farmhouse outside the provincial Dutch village of Ruinerwold", "authors": ["Nadette De Visser"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/I9u5a1_c27nYtXu9p9WYUg--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/69880dadffa63b6cd7e5b6825edb0e48", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
