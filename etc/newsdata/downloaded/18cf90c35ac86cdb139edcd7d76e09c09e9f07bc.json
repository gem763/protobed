Adams, on a hill east of downtown, is one of the southwestern Ohio city\u2019s most historic communities. Its first road dates back to 1793, and its name pays homage to President John Quincy Adams, who came to town in 1843 to dedicate the Cincinnati Observatory. The area has a 19th century European mountain village vibe, with 680 of its roughly 1,000 houses built before 1939 on narrow streets abutting the landmark Eden Park. Today, Mt. Adams commands some of the priciest residential real estate in Cincinnati proper. The approximately 1,500-person neighborhood with a median household income of $99,000, according to census data, attracts both young professionals and retirees looking for a walkable area that\u2019s a five minute drive from downtown.\n\nIllustration: Sanna Mander\n\nNotable stops and shops\n\nBow Tie Caf\u00e9\n\nFormer Cincinnati Bengals linebacker Dhani Jones is one of the co-founders of this all-day restaurant that morphs into a wine bar in the evening.
