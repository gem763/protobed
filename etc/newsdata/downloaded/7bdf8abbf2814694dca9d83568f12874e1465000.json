The particles are completely invisible to the naked eye.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Research led by journalism organisation Orb Media discovered an average of 10 plastic particles per litre\n\nThe level of \"particles released from the teabag packaging are several orders of magnitude higher than plastic loads previously reported in other foods\", according to the study, which was published by the journal of Environmental Science and Technology.\n\nResearcher Laura Hernandez says they were surprised by the amount released compared to those recorded in other studies into things like bottled water.\n\nShe says the discrepancy could be in part due to the fact they focused on the tiniest of particles - both microplastics, which are about the thickness of one hair, and nanoplastics, which are a thousand times smaller.\n\nBut she also said it could be due the fact \"it's a piece of plastic being exposed to boiling water\" and not just water at room temperature.\n\nMs Hernandez noted this is a chance for consumers, like those looking to reduce their plastic use, to be more aware of their purchases.\n\n\"There is really no need to package tea in plastic, which at the end of the day becomes single-use plastic,\" she said. \"[And] which is contributing to you not just ingesting plastic but to the environmental burden of plastic.\"", "description": "The WHO says microplastics in drinking water do not appear to pose a health risk at current levels.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2AAE/production/_108962901_hi053405374.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
