Jane Dodds won 43% of the vote to 39% for Conservative Chris Davies, who was battling to retain his seat after being convicted of expenses fraud.\n\nIt was the first electoral test for Johnson since he succeeded Theresa May as prime minister just over a week ago. Johnson has promised to extract the U.K. from the European Union by Oct. 31, even if it means leaving without a deal to ease the transition.\n\nBut Dodds ran against that idea and used her victory speech to issue a warning to Johnson, urging him to \"stop playing with the future of our communities and rule out a no-deal Brexit now.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats ran in a pact with two other pro-EU parties. The Brexit Party led by euroskeptic Nigel Farage, which has carved out an even harder line than the Conservatives on leaving the EU, peeled away 10% of the vote from the Tories.\n\nEven so, the Brecon and Radnorshire seat was easily won by Davies in 2017, and the vote may have been less a verdict on Brexit than it was on the incumbent's malfeasance, in which he admitted to falsifying several hundred pounds worth of office expenses.\n\nJohnson's Conservatives already fall short of an overall majority in the House of Commons and must rely on Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to round out a coalition. The loss of the seat in Wales is likely to make the job of governing that much more difficult.\n\nJohnson came to power after May's government was unable to get a deal through Parliament for an orderly departure from the EU.\n\nBut Johnson has demanded changes to the divorce deal that May sought approval for, even as the EU has refused further negotiations. If he can't get a suitable deal, Johnson has vowed to leave the European bloc anyway.\n\nThe prospect of a disorderly Brexit has put pressure on the British economy and forced the pound to its lowest levels in years against the U.S. dollar and other currencies.", "description": "The results of the special election leave the ruling prime minister's government with a single-seat majority just as he tries to navigate a difficult departure from the EU.", "authors": ["Scott Neuman"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/08/02/gettyimages-1158947048_wide-2ce92875bbaafdf26086f104e971df44cbdf2a4b.jpg?s=1400"}
