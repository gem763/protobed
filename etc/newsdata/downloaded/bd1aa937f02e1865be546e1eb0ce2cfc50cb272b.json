Now we\u2019re turning our Art Club into an interview series in which we catch up with the artists and designers we admire and find out what drives them.\n\nGraphic designer and art director Nicholas \u201cNickyChulo\u201d Fulcher has worked with some of the biggest names in music. As part of Atlantic Records, he\u2019s designed covers for GoldLink, Kodak Black, Shy Glizzy, Kiiara, and Jon Bellion, in addition to working on the cover of Cardi B\u2019s Grammy award-winning album Invasion of Privacy. His work is almost impossible to miss.\n\nThe Virginia-born, New York-based designer was always a creative at heart. Known around town for being extremely creative and outlandish, Fulcher started designing album covers for local rappers in high school. After some time working in Virginia\u2019s indie scene, he began studying at the Savannah College of Art and Design, but had to drop out early due to financial issues. This led him back to New York City, where he began his professional career working with !llmind, Revolt Media, and ultimately Atlantic Records.\n\nI talked to Fulcher about his origins, his process, and whether he thinks the album cover is due for a change.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nWhen did you realize you wanted to design album covers?\n\nI came across Linkin Park and Jay Z\u2019s Collision Course. That cover spoke to me. And I realized this is something I definitely want to do and love. That was my favorite cover, which kind of propelled me into music. Back then I was more influenced by video games and graffiti. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do with it. But I saw that cover. I was like, \u201cIght, this is my way. This what I want to do.\u201d\n\nHow did your time at SCAD impact you? What do you think about the value of college now?\n\nI mean, I\u2019m like, \u201cFuck, why did I spend so much money!?\u201d I learned a few techniques that I use day to day. I got some education from it. But the most important thing for me was the relationships I built there. Like the kids, the friends, the experience, and the all-nighters. The human bond of people similar to us is something that you can never put a price on. I\u2019m definitely grateful for the SCAD experience and learning these techniques that kind of got me where I am today.\n\nWhat do you think distinguishes a great cover designer from a novice?\n\nThat\u2019s a tough question! I mean, there are kids out there, they\u2019re passionate, and they have Photoshop. They may not be skilled, but they know what they want. They can express themselves and it can be a hit, you know what I mean? I think knowing your audience is what comes with experience being a designer \u2014 like having the experience versus being an internet kid. Understanding visual communication is the difference between a skilled artist and a novice.\n\nWhat does this craft of designing covers mean to you?\n\nDesigning an album cover is very collaborative. It might just be me and the artist, if I know them personally, or management, or the label management and artists. They\u2019ll pitch me their idea, and we kind of make that work to the best of our ability. Sometimes I can pitch my idea if I know the artist well enough. So 60 percent of it is communication and selling your idea, and the other 40 is craft and technique.\n\nThe music industry has gone through a lot of changes recently with the rise of streaming services. Have you felt the changes while working with these artists and different collaborators?\n\nYeah, because it\u2019s more of a singles game now. People are doing one-offs instead of a whole album. And we kind of build around those singles, but it\u2019s not as grandiose as an album. An album is a whole experience, and then a single can be like a short film. You\u2019re getting a taste, but it\u2019s fun and more enriching to do the whole album experience as an art director.\n\nDo you think there\u2019s room for innovation in the medium?\n\nWith Spotify, we\u2019ve done a couple of things. Like Kiiara, for one of her singles, we did the animated cover so when you play the song, it moves around instead of just having that static image.\n\nI think change is imminent, but with music, it\u2019s like a parent. Parents will collect your teeth and your hair forever. Like people still have cassettes, vinyls, and CDs, and I think that all is going to be around. But the peak right now is digital, and I think AR could be next. I would say VR, too, but the only person I remember doing VR was Childish Gambino, like the Pharos thing. I saw potential in that, but no one\u2019s really tapping into it at the moment. It\u2019s changing fast, and I feel like it\u2019s like throwing darts. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to hit, it\u2019s really based on the people.\n\nYou recently tweeted, \u201cI come from a place where we do much more with much less.\u201d Do you think people are as scrappy as they used to be?\n\nI feel like as you move into the corporate world, things are very structured.\n\nAnd because I came from working with indie artists, we didn\u2019t have budgets. I was charging $50 for an album cover. It came from the gut when we were young. We didn\u2019t worry about 90 people\u2019s opinions, and it resonated through the artwork.\n\nHave you found that the number of people involved in the creative process has increased over your career?\n\nOn the label side, yes, but on the indie side, there\u2019s a lot of trust when people come to me from a freelance perspective. That came with popularity and I\u2019m grateful for that. It makes it a lot easier to sell my point, but I don\u2019t just dismiss them either.\n\nWhat was it like holding that Cardi B plaque in your hands?\n\nOh, man. It was mind-blowing. First of many, I hope! I just got approval for the Grammy certificate for Best Rap Album of the year, so that\u2019s coming in, too! I\u2019m gonna flex on the \u2018gram!\n\nLastly, any artists you\u2019d like to shout out?\n\nTony Whlgn, Jimi Tents, !llmind, Quadry, and Megan Harris, my plus one.", "description": "Nicholas \"NickyChulo\" Fulcher has designed covers for GoldLink, Kodak Black, Shy Glizzy, Kiiara, and Jon Bellion, in addition to working on the cover of Cardi B\u2019s Grammy award-winning album Invasion of Privacy.
