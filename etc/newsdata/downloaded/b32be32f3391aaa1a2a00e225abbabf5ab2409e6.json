British troops liberated the locals then \u2014 and a few dozen Zimbabweans keep them safe now.\n\n\u201cThere are over 100 minefields flung all across the Falkland Islands from Fox Bay, Port Howard, Goose Green, Fizroy, Stanley area, Longden, all over the place,\u201d said John Hare, the technical director of SafeLane Global, which has been contracted by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office to clear the mines.\n\nThe Argentine army laid around 25,000 mines during their 74-day occupation of the remote British overseas territory in the South Atlantic. For the past decade, expert Zimbabwean deminers have been charged with clearing the fields.\n\nWhen the war ended in 1982, the Argentines handed over their records.\n\nSince then, demining teams have undertaken the painstaking process of trawling through the documents, sourcing background information from locals and probing into minefields for evidence of potential explosives.\n\nOnly once that was done did the deminers start clearing the explosive devices.\n\n\u201cThe Zimbabwean deminers are experts in this job. We\u2019ve been doing this for quite a long time, most of us are in our 21st year doing this job,\u201d Michael Madziva, the site supervisor, told AFP about his 100-strong team.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Great group of guys\u2019 \u2013\n\nBack in 1999 a company called Bactec, which was one of several to later merge into SafeLane Global, was contracted to clear two million mines along the border between Zimbabwe and Mozambique.\n\nLocal Zimbabweans were recruited and trained, and they have since become world-renowned for their expertise.\n\n\u201cSince 2015, I\u2019ve had basically the same group of deminers,\u201d said Hare, who used to be a bomb disposal expert with the Royal Engineers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 a really great group of guys to work with.\u201d\n\nThe Zimbabwean experts have been deployed all over the world \u2014 including to Afghanistan, Iraq, South Sudan, Eritrea, Croatia and Lebanon \u2014 to clear mines following devastating conflicts.\n\n\u201cWhat made them good deminers is they love their job,\u201d added Madziva.\n\nThere were originally 122 areas to clear in the Falklands, but there are only 11 to 12 left. The project, which began in 2009, is expected to finish by the end of next year, according to Guy Marot, who heads the Falkland Islands Demining Service Program.\n\nThe group is currently working on a beach close to the Falklands capital Stanley, where Argentina expected British troops to land. Instead, they arrived on the other side of the East Falkland island at San Carlos.\n\nOnce located by a huge digger that sifts through the sand, the mines are either disarmed on the spot and then transferred to a quarry to be burnt, or those that are too dangerous to move are destroyed on the spot by explosives.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Thrilled to see snow\u2019 \u2013\n\nEven though it\u2019s a long way from home, some deminers went on to settle in the Falklands.\n\nJonas Muza, 41, quit demining and moved to the Falklands in 2015. His wife Anna joined him a year later, and he\u2019s expecting to bring his three daughters over next year.\n\n\u201cI liked it before even I came here. I liked the place because of the weather,\u201d Muza told AFP.\n\n\u201cI was thrilled to see snow for the first time.\u201d\n\nAnna, who works as a kitchen assistant in the deminers\u2019 group accommodation, wasn\u2019t quite so enamored.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very cold here,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI was shocked.\u201d\n\nDeminers work in the Falklands from September to June, but Muza wanted employment all year round, so he found work fitting tires instead.\n\n\u201cIn demining, when the contract finishes, it\u2019s obvious you are unemployed until another job comes your way. I didn\u2019t like that. I wanted constant income so I can sustain my family,\u201d said Muza.\n\nAlthough his children \u2014 Nathalie, 17, Keisha, 11, and five-year-old Kiara \u2014 have been enrolled in school for the next year, Muza doesn\u2019t see the Falklands as a permanent home.\n\nHe\u2019s building a nine-room house in Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cI will go back some point in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cLike they say, home calls you.
