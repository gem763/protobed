When showrunners, writers, and directors stick a glancing reference to Luke Cage\u2019s yellow shirt from his 1970s comics in the gritty 2016 Netflix series, it\u2019s a way of nodding to the fans, of saying \u201cWe\u2019re fans too, and we can be trusted with your beloved properties.\u201d\n\nThat seems to be the intention behind the omnipresent Easter eggs in HBO\u2019s new Watchmen series, helmed by Lost and The Leftovers co-creator Damon Lindelof. The visual, narrative, and thematic references to the original Alan Moore / Dave Gibbons comic are obsessive and ubiquitous. But they don\u2019t show that the series is keeping the faith. The Easter eggs inadvertently highlight how different HBO\u2019s Watchmen is from the comic. A Watchmen packed with Easter eggs doesn\u2019t show how faithful Lindelof and crew are to the original. It shows the ways they\u2019re striking out on their own.\n\nAs a sequel set in the same world as the original comic, the Watchmen series broadly references the original in plot and world-building. The white supremacist group the Seventh Cavalry has adopted Rorschach inkblot masks, inspired by the one worn by Watchmen\u2019s vigilante hero. They quote from his journal, altering the text to make the fascist and racist subtext more explicit. Robert Redford, whose presidential campaign was just getting started at the end of the Watchmen comic, has been president in the series for some 30 years. There\u2019s a miniseries event on TV about the 1940s superhero group the Minutemen, and it plays in the background of many scenes, reiterating, elaborating on, or parodying events from the comic.\n\nBut there are also a lot of gratuitous visual nods to the original series. These don\u2019t contribute to consistent world-building; they simply wave to fans. Some of the most blatant ones in the pilot episode include:\n\nMasked detective Looking Glass (Tim Blake Nelson) rolls his mask up over his mouth when he eats, in an image that recalls Rorschach rolling his mask up to eat beans in the comic.\n\nChief of police Judd Crawford (Don Johnson) tells Looking Glass, \u201cPull your face down,\u201d again recalling the original Rorschach, who referred to his mask as his face.\n\nSeventh Cavalry members are shown disassembling watches as part of a mysterious terrorism plot. The exposed gears recall the broken watch gears that, through a series of accidents, led Jon Osterman to become Dr. Manhattan.\n\nOne of the Seventh Cavalry members swallows a poison pill. Angela / Sister Night (Regina King) yells \u201cSpit it out! Spit it out!\u201d It\u2019s a direct reference to a similar scene in the Watchmen comic, where Adrian Veidt wrestles an assassin with a poison pill.\n\nAngela walks past a man carrying a sign that reads \u201cThe Future Is Bright.\u201d It recalls a sign Rorschach carried in his secret identity which said, \u201cThe End Is Nigh.\u201d\n\nThe last image of the first episode is of Judd\u2019s badge, marked with a single slanted drop of blood, referencing the signature Watchmen image of the Comedian\u2019s smiley-face button, similarly marked with blood.\n\nIn a scene where Angela teaches cooking to an elementary school class, there\u2019s a shot up through the bottom of a glass bowl. Her dropped egg yolks form a smiley face, again recalling the Comedian button. This is (no doubt intentionally) an Easter egg literally made of eggs.\n\nAnd those are only some of the references in the first episode. As the series continues (the first six episodes were provided to critics), there are many, many more, particularly paralleling the comic\u2019s obsessive imagery around clock faces with the hands nearing midnight.\n\nThese Easter eggs aren\u2019t thematically or even really visually integrated into the series. The egg-yolk smile doesn\u2019t mean anything in the context of the show except, \u201cHey, fans of the original Watchmen! Here\u2019s a smiley face!\u201d It\u2019s a fun wink, but that\u2019s a radically different approach to image repetition than Moore\u2019s careful, obsessive parallels in the comic.\n\nThe most famous example of Moore and Gibbons\u2019 use of visual motifs is the Comedian\u2019s smiley-face button, stained with blood. The first image of the first issue is of the button lying in the gutter. The last image of the last issue is of a man wearing a smiley-face shirt stained with a splotch of ketchup so it matches the opening image. The Watchmen graphic novel starts and ends in the same place. It\u2019s a perfect closed system \u2014 a smiley-faced, bloody loop with no escape.\n\nWatchmen the comic is remorselessly self-contained. Dave Gibbons\u2019 nine-panel-per-page grid sometimes shifts, as two, three, or four panels fuse into one, but it never opens up. Ominous recurring or parallel images \u2014 a nuclear hazard sign, the inkblots on Rorschach\u2019s mask, a butterfly in a frozen wasteland \u2014 appear and reappear, not as random in-jokes, but as signposts in Moore\u2019s narrative maze. They\u2019re a reminder that readers can\u2019t get out. Watchmen is meant to put readers in the blue skin of Dr. Manhattan, who sees all time at once, and so is hopelessly frozen in his own destiny. He sees himself as locked in the grid of what he has done and will do. Superhero stories are usually about how remarkable individuals can transform the world. Watchmen is about how even heroes (and in Dr. Manhattan\u2019s case, even god-like beings) can be stuck in the boxes the world creates for them.\n\nAnd even though the comic\u2019s conclusion points to a more peaceful future, it\u2019s hard to see things really improving in its world, or even continuing. Watchmen is a complete and circular story, set in a grim world where inevitable cataclysm is eternally approaching. That uniquely airless sense of sadness and melancholy is one of its primary draws.\n\nA Watchmen sequel was, by definition, never going to reproduce that sense of a world that couldn\u2019t support a sequel. The television show is a looser, messier, more seat-of-the-pants affair than the comic, jumping from a recreation of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre to police drama to domestic sit-com in a helter-skelter scramble of genre tropes. That\u2019s part of what gives the series the sense of hope and open possibilities that isn\u2019t much evident in the comic, with its slow, measured tread toward doom.\n\nIn Watchmen the series, Lindelof and company constantly let viewers know they\u2019re riffing on a past product. That neatly fits the world of the show, which is dedicated to riffing and improvisation, too. President Robert Redford and Tulsa\u2019s leadership are trying to get out of the grid of racism by introducing new policies and new ideas \u2014 most notably, reparations and an acknowledgement of racist history. The original Watchmen was a story about a world with no options. The new series is about how people can maybe get from nowhere to somewhere, if they have some imagination and an awareness of where they come from. And that theme is drawn more clearly in upcoming episodes.\n\nLindelof doesn\u2019t drop a yolky smile in his show\u2019s pilot to signal that he\u2019s serving up the same meal Alan Moore offered. He\u2019s showing us that he has an entirely new shell for this story. The TV show keeps nudging fans to remember the original comic so it can show off how it\u2019s trying to go somewhere else. It\u2019s a constant reminder that the show isn\u2019t as thoroughly thought-through and self-contained as the source material. But we already have the Watchmen comic for that. The TV series breaks a few eggs to see what kind of omelet comes out.", "description": "Damon Lindelof\u2019s HBO series Watchmen comes packed with visual references and in-jokes based on Alan Moore\u2019s comic series.
