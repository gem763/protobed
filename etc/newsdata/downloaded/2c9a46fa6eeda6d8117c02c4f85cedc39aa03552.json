After months of agonising hearsay, pop artthrob Harry Styles has finally confirmed that he was in the running \u2013 perhaps even Disney\u2019s top choice \u2013 to play Prince Eric in the upcoming remake of The Little Mermaid. But before you get too excited about that, it seems it was not meant to be. I know, we're heartbroken too.\n\nThe role of Eric (which hasn\u2019t been formally cast yet) seems to have landed on Harry\u2019s lap earlier in the year. In a cute FaceTime interview with British pop radio station Capital, the 'Sign of the Times' star told the presenters that he met with the film\u2019s director Rob Marshall, who he calls \u201cthe most wonderful man\u201d, but that there were a few things that meant he wouldn\u2019t be able to commit to the role.\n\nSee, though Harry \u201cthinks it\u2019s going to be amazing\u201d, the film would slice right through a whole year of new music and -- though he seems hesitant to admit it since no formal announcement has been made -- other plans too. He tried to bluff his way out of the question before slowly caving: \u201c[Those films] shoot for so long, and I wanna tour next year and stuff,\u201d he says, before noticing his own slip-up. To try and cover his tracks, he added, \u201cMaybe, I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s potentially not\u2026 it hasn\u2019t been announced yet so..\u201d to the end of his sentence, before moving on to the next question.\n\nAt this point, another Harry Styles world tour was a given, but the nugget of information sent Styles fans across the internet into a frenzy nonetheless. Following the release of his comeback single 'Lights Up', which made our hearts swell to breaking point when it dropped earlier this month, he\u2019s expected to drop an album at some point in the very near future (an early Christmas present, plz?).\n\nEither way, it would\u2019ve been quite nice to have been blessed with both at the same time, like the delicious double-bill of Dunkirk and his excellent debut record going stratospheric around the same time. Turns out we\u2019ll just have to wait a little bit longer for Harry\u2019s return to the big screen. In the meantime, guess we'll just camp out for tour tickets.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "Forever our Prince Eric!
