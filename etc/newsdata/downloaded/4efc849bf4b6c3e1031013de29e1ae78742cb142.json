But there\u2019s one subject that\u2019s often taboo: preparing for widowhood.\n\nJust as younger breadwinners rarely enjoy chatting about life insurance because they dread facing their mortality, retirees may avoid addressing what would happen to the surviving spouse if one of them died. Yet confronting this grim (but likely) scenario is among the most important conversations aging couples should have.\n\nAfter losing a longtime husband or wife, it\u2019s almost unbearable to shift from grief to practical money matters within days of the funeral. The process is especially harrowing for individuals (often women) who did not get too involved in financial affairs during their marriage.\n\nYet this is exactly what happens in many cases. About 76% of married retirees said they would not be financially prepared if their spouse died, according to a 2018 study.\n\nIn theory, many couples know they should take certain steps as they near retirement: draft a financial plan (perhaps with an adviser\u2019s help) that includes provisions if one of them dies prematurely, share passwords on all bank accounts and complete wills, trusts, advance directives and power of attorney forms. In practice, however, it\u2019s easy to procrastinate on any or all of these tasks.\n\nYet there are other, equally vital to-do items that few couples realize they need to do. Tackle these less obvious chores and you give a priceless gift to your spouse who might be suddenly alone and adrift after your death.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be completely prepared for this situation, but there are some things you can control,\u201d said Ashley Folkes, a Phoenix-based certified financial planner. He urges couples to draft a \u201cletter of instruction\u201d that covers easy-to-overlook issues such as how to unlock the home safe, where you keep the key to your bank deposit box and which trusted individuals to contact (from adult children to attorneys to insurance agents) along with decisions or information tied to them. Include any loan documents, family business holdings and real estate deeds and titles.\n\nOn an even more mundane level, it helps to create a list of key contacts that support your household. Examples include your auto mechanic, handyman and gardener. And if you\u2019ve established ongoing service contracts with providers such as exterminators\u2014or automatic monthly payments to gyms or other subscriptions\u2014add them to your list.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows to list their doctor\u2019s contact information,\u201d said Dennis Nolte, a certified financial planner in Winter Park, Fla. \u201cBut don\u2019t forget your window washer, roofer and electrician.\u201d\n\nAmid all these practical preparations, don\u2019t neglect more emotional or spiritual matters. As a couple, consider what larger and more meaningful messages you want to leave with each other\u2014and with your families.\n\nLaura Medigovich, a certified financial planner in Purchase, N.Y., suggests creating an ethical will, which she describes as \u201ca love letter to your family when you\u2019re no longer around.\u201d It can consist of your beliefs, life lessons and hopes and dreams for children, grandchildren and others closest to you.\n\n\u201cYou can also share your wishes such as where your spouse might live if you die and that they\u2019re not being disloyal if they move on and find another love in their life,\u201d she said. \u201cYou might also share your legacy planning. Should your spouse continue to donate to a certain charity or pay for a grandchild\u2019s schooling?\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of a spouse\u2019s death, you\u2019ll need to send freshly minted death certificates to a surprisingly large number of recipients, from life insurers to banks to creditors. Be forewarned: These companies probably won\u2019t accept photocopies.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need lots of death certificates to send out so just buy 10 or a dozen of them,\u201d said Matthew Gaffey, a certified financial planner in McLean, Va. \u201cIf you end up spending an extra $20 or whatever, consider it a sunk cost\u201d that outweighs the hassle of reordering more.", "description": "One of the most important conversations couples should have", "authors": ["Morey Stettner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HL484_funera_ZG_20190614213100.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
