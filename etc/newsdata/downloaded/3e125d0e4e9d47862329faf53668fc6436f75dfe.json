Bob Menendez (D-NJ) sent a letter asking Perry to hand over details of his trip to Ukraine for President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in May, which was mentioned in a partisan CIA officer\u2019s so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint regarding President Donald Trump\u2019s July 25th telephone call with Zelensky. Politico notes the Trump cabinet member\u2019s plans to leave his post have no relation to the Ukraine matter.\n\nDeputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette will likely take over for Perry.\n\nPresident Donald Trump nominated Perry as Energy Secretary on December 14th, 2016, and he was confirmed on March 2nd, 2017, by the Senate in a 62-37 vote.\n\nBefore joining the Trump administration, Perry served Texas\u2019s longest-serving governor from December 2000 to January 2015.\n\nHe ran unsuccessfully for president in 2012 and 2016.", "description": "U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry is expected to step down in November, according to a report.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Rick-Perry-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
