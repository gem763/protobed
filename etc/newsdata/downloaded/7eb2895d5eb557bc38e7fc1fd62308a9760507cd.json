You're meant to say you are still trying to get a deal with the EU.\n\nAnd instead you loudly announce to Parliament that you are not.\n\nThat's what happened to Tory Michael Gove , who fluffed his words at the worst possible moment as he unveiled a new 159-page document on no-deal planning.\n\nThe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster announced: \"We in this government have compromised!We in this government are showing flexibility!\n\n\u201cWe in this government seek to leave without a deal!\"\n\n(Image: PRU/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHe was of course supposed to say \"with\" a deal.\n\nHe added: \"But faced with the delaying, disruptive and denying tactics of the opposition, we say on behalf of the 17.4million - enough enough enough, we need to leave.\"\n\nThe timing was unfortunate for Mr Gove, as it came amid a furious row in which the EU has accused Boris Johnson of not really wanting a Brexit deal at all.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk accused the Prime Minister of a \"stupid blame game\" as deal talks looked close to collapse with a few days to go.\n\nMr Johnson has just days to agree a Brexit deal with the EU before a summit on October 17 - and last week unveiled a system for two borders in the region.\n\nBut the plans have prompted a cool reaction in the EU. And today No10 sources sent out briefings saying a deal was unlikely and pinning the blame on Brussels.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMr Gove was in Parliament to speak about the government's \"no deal readiness report\", with Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisting he will deliver an EU withdrawal by October 31.\n\nThe document mainly repeated already-announced commitments such as 1,000 new Border Force staff.\n\nBut it also announced HMRC has written to 220,000 businesses offering guidance on the steps they need to take over imports and exports after October 31.\n\nAnd it confirmed the government has set up a 'Support Unit' for suppliers of medical goods to ensure there is not a shortage of vital medicines.", "description": "The Tory Cabinet minister may have committed the greatest Freudian slip ever as he unveiled new no-deal plans - amid a furious row with the EU", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pru Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20539159.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-POLITICS-EU-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
