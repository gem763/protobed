The global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index in June hit its highest level ever, eclipsing periods after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 two stretches during which U.S. recessions were already underway and employers were slashing jobs.\n\nNow, Trump-related uncertainty dominates talk among corporate executives on earnings calls and during discussions at the U.S. Federal Reserve. Companies are reining in capital spending and slowing their hiring plans, unsure what the unpredictable president might do next and whether it will help tip the U.S. from slowing growth into recession.
