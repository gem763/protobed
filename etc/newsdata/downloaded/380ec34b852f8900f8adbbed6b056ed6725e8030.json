But He May Not.", "language": "en", "text": "The most important LGBTQ equality cases since same-sex marriage may be a toss-up. And the swing vote\u2014surprisingly, based on today\u2019s oral arguments\u2014may be Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\nAt issue in today\u2019s three cases is whether the federal anti-discrimination law, known as Title VII, protects gay and trans workers from being fired because of who they are. That law does not mention sexual orientation or gender identity. But, LGBTQ advocates argue, when someone is fired for being LGBTQ, that is covered under Title VII\u2019s ban on discrimination \u201cbecause of sex.\u201d\n\nInside the Supreme Court Discrimination Cases That Could Change LGBTQ Rights\n\nAfter all, they argued today, if a man is fired from his job for disclosing that he is attracted to other men\u2014as happened to Gerald Bostock, one of the plaintiffs today\u2014that is sex discrimination: had Gerald Bostock been a woman, he wouldn\u2019t have been fired.\n\nLikewise, when Aimee Stephens transitioned from male to female, her employer (a funeral home) fired her. She attended the Supreme Court on Tuesday, accompanied by her attorneys and actress and advocate Laverne Cox.\n\nOnce again, Stephens' advocates argued, this is discrimination \u201cbecause of sex\u201d: had Stephens been biologically female (or, more precisely, assigned the sex of female at birth), she would not have been fired for coming to work dressed as the woman she is.\n\nThat the cases are at the Supreme Court might surprise many. The vast majority of Americans\u201472 percent, according to UCLA\u2019s Williams Institute\u2014say that transgender people should be protected from employment discrimination. The number is even higher for LGB people.\n\nIn fact, a majority of Americans think that it\u2019s already illegal to fire someone for being gay or trans, and are surprised to hear that it isn\u2019t.\n\nAt oral arguments today at the Supreme Court, the ideologically divided court\u2014five conservatives, four liberals\u2014mostly hewed to form.\n\nUS actress and LGBTQ+ advocate Laverne Cox (center), actress Sara Ramirez and attorney Chase Strangio (right) outside the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, October 8, 2019. SAUL LOEB/Getty More\n\nFirst, the Court\u2019s four liberals all seemed sympathetic to the plaintiffs. Justice Elena Kagan said that Title VII \u201cpretty firmly\u201d backs their claims that they\u2019d been discriminated against \u201cbecause of sex.\u201d She said the test was \u201cextremely simple\u201d: Would the same thing have happened to you if you were a different sex? If not, that\u2019s sex discrimination.\n\nAnd Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg noted that Title VII has been expanded before. Sexual harassment was also not explicitly included in the law, yet cases involving harassment are now routinely covered by it.\n\nOn the other hand, Chief Justice John Roberts expressed concern that the Court was being asked to take the role of Congress, and indeed override Congress\u2019s express refusal to protect gay and trans workers. (The Equality Act, which would do so, passed the House earlier this year but has not been brought up for a vote in the Senate.)\n\nThis is certainly correct. Even if LGBTQ advocates\u2019 reading of Title VII makes sense on paper, it clearly defies both Congress\u2019 understanding of the law and its refusal to expand it.\n\nAimee Stephens sits in her wheelchair outside the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, October 8, 2019.
