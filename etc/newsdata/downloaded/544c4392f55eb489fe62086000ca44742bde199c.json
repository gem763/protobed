BoJack is sober now. And he\u2019s trying more sincerely than he ever has to grow up, make amends, and stop hurting the people who care about him. Being sober means no more hiding from the guilt of past transgressions at the bottom of a bottle; he remembers everything now and struggles to live with it. Sarah Lynn, his mother\u2019s death, what happened in New Mexico, Herb Kazzaz\u2014it\u2019s a lot, though he\u2019s trying.\n\nBut that nascent hope comes tinged with something else: the lurching sensation that this time real, lasting consequences are coming for him, the kind Princess Carolyn can\u2019t make disappear. And it isn\u2019t as if we can say he doesn\u2019t deserve it.\n\nThere are reporters doggedly sniffing out the circumstances of Sarah Lynn\u2019s death; his daughter, Hollyhock, is about to find out how he abandoned an alcohol-poisoned teenager and made off with an old flame\u2019s daughter on their prom night. (Not even the worst thing that happened that night!) BoJack can no longer distance himself from two of his most painful mistakes. No matter how he course-corrects now, there\u2019s no more road left for him to run.\n\nThrough fame, money, and plain luck, BoJack has often walked away from disasters that leave others in ruins. In the first scene of season six, we learn he lied on the night of Sarah Lynn\u2019s overdose, not only to police, but straight to her mother\u2019s face. He casts himself as a good samaritan who showed up to help but arrived too late, omitting that the two were on a cross-country bender and that it was BoJack\u2019s heroin that killed her. In the eighth episode, a young man at a party in New York tells Hollyhock about his years-long abstinence from alcohol. His reasoning begins to sound horrifically familiar, until we realize this is the kid BoJack left to wheel his semi-conscious date into a hospital alone four years ago, after forcing him to lie about where she got the alcohol.\n\nThe series has never forgotten or excused BoJack for these mistakes\u2014his guilt often drove him to drugs and alcohol, enabling more mistakes, more guilt, rinse, repeat\u2014though his perspective naturally minimizes their impact on peripheral characters, like Sarah Lynn\u2019s mom or Penny\u2019s friend in New Mexico. Season six brims with more hard-earned hope than any season yet, but it\u2019s also a reckoning for BoJack, as these connections and more begin to seize space and demand consideration. The intro\u2019s animation changes to reflect that: instead of snapshots of BoJack\u2019s current life, it becomes a carousel of memories that haunt him, each attached to a person he\u2019s betrayed: his ailing mother Beatrice, Horsin\u2019 Around creator Herb Kazzaz, ex-Secretariat director Kelsey Jannings, Charlotte and her daughter Penny, his Philbert costar Gina, and above all, Sarah Lynn.\n\nThe starry sky that hung over the Griffith Observatory the night Sarah Lynn died colors the bottles of alcohol BoJack sees while in rehab, reminding him what\u2019s at stake. It\u2019s also her photo on the front desk clerk\u2019s wall of Polaroids that pushes him to start taking sobriety seriously. It\u2019s a melancholy but effective way to close a cycle that this season sheds light on: Sarah Lynn became drunk on vodka she found in her surrogate dad BoJack\u2019s dressing room as a kid, paralleling BoJack\u2019s early exposure to booze from his own parents. For both, as children, it was a way to be closer to adults who withheld affection. And for BoJack, at least, it became a crutch he used to connect with people\u2014at parties as a shy teenager and on set as a nervous young actor, often at the cost of alienating someone who already liked him for who he is.\n\nBoJack Horseman has often argued that people (and horses, cats, dogs, and Todds) are too unpredictable and vast to be defined by trauma, anger, or regret. It doesn\u2019t offer these memories to \u201cexplain\u201d BoJack\u2019s psyche as much as it does to contextualize it. For so long, BoJack\u2019s believed he\u2019s broken because he keeps hurting the few people who genuinely care for him. But the show itself has never quite agreed. In its final season, it reiterates that no one gets through life unscathed, but no one is irrevocably broken either\u2014everyone is wounded, fragile, difficult, uncertain, and often convinced we are alone, despite how universal those feelings really are. Few TV shows are more compassionate about those parts of ourselves, thus few are more essential.\n\nBoJack\u2019s recovery goes far from easily; he lashes out at fellow patients (including an undercover Jay Hernandez \u201cresearching the role\u201d of a Super Mario addicted to painkillers\u2014for a movie directed, of course, by Zack Snyder) and struggles to stop deflecting and start taking responsibility when called out. He also grows overly attached to the rhythms of rehab, an insular bubble less like real life than summer camp. His reluctance to leave recalls The BoJack Horseman Show creator Cuddlywhiskers\u2019 seclusion in Ojai\u2014itself a form of selfishness, as Diane remarked in season three\u2019s \u201cBoJack Kills.\u201d (Though what Cuddlywhiskers said in response resonated just as truthfully: \u201cIt takes a long time to realize how truly miserable you are, and an even longer time to see it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Only after you give up everything can you begin to find a way to be happy.\u201d BoJack brushed him off at the time but I wonder what he\u2019d make of that advice now.)\n\nEven when BoJack is earnestly trying, he learns, terrible mistakes can still happen. BoJack tosses out another patient\u2019s water bottle full of vodka, only for it to land in an incoming crate, then into his doctor\u2019s hands. The doctor ends up blackout drunk but, remarkably, BoJack doesn\u2019t run from the aftermath. He stays by his side and checks him into another rehab. More miraculously, even after his doctor wakes up and berates him, the remorse he feels doesn\u2019t drive him to drink. It\u2019s one of his first truly selfless acts this season.\n\nThese are big strides for him, as in how he makes amends with a hairdresser, Sharona, whom he got fired off Horsin\u2019 Around years ago. She makes fun of his mane (\u201cWhat color is this, Sharpie?\u201d) and convinces him to wear his natural gray. Now that he looks the part of a more mature BoJack, he flies to Connecticut to visit Hollyhock, whose interaction with a friend at Wesleyan reveals more emotional wisdom than BoJack\u2019s scraped together all his life. He tries to mediate a fight between the girls and dispenses what he sees as truisms for their benefit: \u201cPeople will disappoint you,\u201d \u201csome wounds never heal,\u201d \u201cwords are meaningless.\u201d Each sounds like an excuse for defeatism compared to what Hollyhock actually tells her friend: \u201cYou do this thing where you don\u2019t think you can ever be forgiven, so you don\u2019t apologize, but I can\u2019t forgive you if you don\u2019t say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d The friend apologizes, the rift instantly heals, and BoJack is left agog.\n\n\u201c Of course, \u2018BoJack Horseman\u2019 has always reserved as much empathy for the people most closely affected by BoJack\u2019s self-destructive spirals. In this final season, it\u2019s a joy to see that their worlds have kept turning without him. \u201d\n\nOf course, BoJack Horseman has always reserved as much empathy for the people most closely affected by BoJack\u2019s self-destructive spirals. In this final season, it\u2019s a joy to see that their worlds have kept turning without him. The second episode, \u201cNew Client,\u201d illustrates the overwhelming have-it-all pressures of new motherhood with heartbreaking acuity. Animators bring to life dozens of harried Princess Carolyns at once, each performing one of the tasks on her endless mental to-do list. Her new baby\u2019s cries serve as the metronome coordinating the Carolyns\u2019 movements. But they\u2019re also a siren that never goes off, wearing her down until she passes out. It\u2019s a startlingly effective device, better at conveying an interior sense of chaos than any since season four\u2019s \u201cStupid Piece of Sh*t,\u201d which voiced BoJack\u2019s self-loathing mental monologues aloud. It may even be more harrowing.\n\n\u201cFeel-Good Story\u201d finds Diane on the road filming news segments with a cameraman named Guy. We meet the buffalo for the first time in this episode, yet we\u2019re enamored within 26 minutes as he and Diane spark a romance more authentically human than most live-action features achieve in 90-plus minutes. (The show\u2019s writers are that good.) Mr. Peanutbutter and his new fianc\u00e9 Pickles nearly break up over his infidelity, but Diane and BoJack do their part to patch them up\u2014another uncharacteristically selfless act for BoJack, ditto how he gets a cute barista to sign up for Todd\u2019s asexual dating app later. Ditzy, social media-obsessed Pickles might have been an easy target for another show\u2019s lazy jokes. But here, she\u2019s granted the emotional complexity to become a sympathetic character.\n\nThe season brings highs and lows to each of these characters\u2019 lives, each realized with the show\u2019s signature blend of raw emotional insight and silly, goofball humor. (A favorite Todd joke from this season: \u201cAssistants are like Deadpool movies. I couldn\u2019t just stop at one even though I probably should have.\u201d) It\u2019s hard to guess what sort of ending BoJack himself might deserve. He may be doing the work to overpower his demons, but he still owes a debt for his most unforgivable mistakes\u2014one that weird pair of His Girl Friday-style reporters will soon track him down to pay. Yet for these eight episodes about growth and setbacks and the up and downsides of realized dreams, the show has never been more optimistic. It\u2019s a bittersweet beginning of the end. But that\u2019s only fitting for a show this true to life.", "description": "The first eight episodes of \u201cBoJack Horseman\u2019s\u201d sixth and final season are now streaming, and see its title character experience a reckoning of sorts.
