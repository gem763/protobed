Had I not been at the Airlines 2050 event on Thursday, I would have been in court. Not in the dock, you understand, but in cheap seats of Court 73 in the High Court. Five separate judicial reviews of the government\u2019s plans for adding a third runway to the UK\u2019s biggest airport began on Thursday, with Greenpeace, the London mayor and the rival Heathrow Hub project among the appellants.\n\nThe judges will deserve a holiday by the time they have waded through all the conflicting evidence and reached their conclusions on the legality of expansion.\n\n\u201cDoing nothing is not an option,\u201d is the refrain from the airline industry on the subject of runway capacity around London, the world capital of aviation in terms of passenger numbers.\n\nThe Roskill Commission first recommended airport expansion in southeast England in 1973. Since then nine prime ministers have studiously done nothing. Boris Johnson \u2013 who you may recall was himself a Westminster no-show while foreign secretary, missing the crucial parliamentary vote on Heathrow \u2013 may make number 10.\n\nPutting short-term electoral expediency ahead of long-term infrastructure investment is regarded by today\u2019s politicians as an easy win, as the backers of the High Speed 2 rail scheme may be about to discover.\n\nAnd the benefits of Brexit? In a 2016 blog, Mr Shapps wrote: \u201cI was a Remainer, but I have embraced the new direction of the country.\n\n\u201cI am backing Brexit all the way, as hard as you like, and I\u2019m bullish about the UK\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nBut the delegates at Airlines 2050 were hard-pressed to think of any advantages that leaving the EU would bring the traveller. After all, the UK\u2019s aviation industry has prospered largely through deregulation within the European Union and the EU-negotiated transatlantic \u201copen skies\u201d agreement.\n\nBritain will get no more freedom to negotiate aviation deals with nations elsewhere in the world than it enjoys now. Operations will become vastly more complex for pan-European airlines such as easyJet. And while some airports may welcome the opportunity to start selling duty-free alcohol and tobacco to travellers to Europe, the immediate gains will be more than offset by the relative decline in passengers due to the UK leaving the EU.\n\nThe available evidence suggests inbound tourism will wilt further as Britain becomes more insular; airlines will \u201cpivot\u201d capacity away from the UK; and travellers will have less choice and higher fares than would otherwise prevail.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come up with a new hobby of spotting the Brexit dividends where some commentators can only see doom and gloom,\u201d wrote Mr Shapps.\n\nA shame the transport secretary was unable to share those dividends with the airline industry.", "description": "Thursday was a strange day at Westminster: not just in the House of Commons, where a Eurofudge of questionable appeal was being promoted, but also across Parliament Square at the QE2 Centre.
