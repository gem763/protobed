(Vaughn Ridley / Getty Images)\n\nA rookie helped out with his bat and in the field as Justin Verlander wrote another bit of baseball history Sunday, throwing the third no-hitter of his career.\n\nVerlander, whose previous no-hitters came as a member of the Detroit Tigers, struck out 14 and shut out the Toronto Blue Jays, 2-0, on 120 pitches in Toronto. No-hitters are always fraught with will-he-or-won\u2019t-he tension, but this game was particularly taut, with the Astros and Jays locked in a 0-0 tie entering the ninth inning.\n\n[Box score: Astros 2, Blue Jays 0]\n\nBut, with two outs in the top of the inning, rookie Abraham Toro hit a two-run home run in only his eighth game in the major leagues and, in the bottom of the inning, he assisted on the final out. When Verlander closed it out in the bottom of the inning, he saved his most enthusiastic hug for Toro, yelling, \u201cWhere the f--- is Toro?\u201d as he scanned the field for his teammate.\n\nThis no-hitter marked the second time Verlander has had the Blue Jays\u2019 number in Canada. He no-hit the team at Rogers Centre in 2011. He becomes the first pitcher to no-hit the same team twice on the road, according to MLB.com\u2019s Sarah Langs. Only Tim Lincecum (against the San Diego Padres) and Addie Joss (against the Chicago White Sox) have thrown no-hitters twice against the same opponent. His first no-hitter came in 2007 against the Milwaukee Brewers and while he may be an old hand at them, he admitted afterward that he was thinking about pulling it off.\n\n\u201cYou start thinking about it third, fourth, fifth inning, then it\u2019s definitely on your mind,\u201d he said (via Yahoo). \u201cEighth inning very prevalent. Ninth inning, I had memories of blowing a few in the ninth. So I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t thinking about that.\u201d\n\nJustin Verlander career no-hitters IN Toronto: 2\n\n\n\nToronto Blue Jays franchise no-hitters: 1pic.twitter.com/gEk5Qt0Ix0 \u2014 CBS Sports HQ (@CBSSportsHQ) September 1, 2019\n\nJays shortstop Bo Bichette was the last hitter he faced and Verlander admitted that he grew increasingly anxious as the at-bat reached seven pitches. At that point, though, Bichette sent a grounder toward Toro at third and Verlander celebrated like a kid rather than a 36-year-old veteran.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I just thought \u2018please be an out, please be an out.\u2019 I saw him catch a seam and he sort of got under the ball,\u201d Verlander said. \u201cIt was kind of like a Frisbee going over to first base and I just thought \u2018please don\u2019t let it go over his head.\u2019 As soon as he catches it, it\u2019s just elation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also historic, placing Verlander in a club occupied by only five other pitchers with at least three no-hitters. Nolan Ryan had seven, Sandy Koufax four and Bob Feller, Larry Corcoran and Cy Young had three each.\n\nThe no-hitter came with a sweet note from his wife and \u201c#1 fan,\u201d model Kate Upton.\n\nForever your #1 fan \ud83d\ude0d Congrats on your 3rd no hitter @JustinVerlander!! pic.twitter.com/0Sx947TyZ6 \u2014 Kate Upton (@KateUpton) September 1, 2019\n\nThe Houston Texans\u2019 J.J.
