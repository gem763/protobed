US tariffs imposed on China may have been a key cause of the gathering gloom about a global economic slowdown with unpredictable consequences.\n\nBut the shelving of the next planned round of rises this week will lift optimism in global markets - with Trump inevitably depicting himself as the saviour of the world economy as well as of the US.\n\nChinese authorities are being much more cautious in their description. They know how quickly fulsome praise from Trump can turn into bitter denunciations and unexpected policy shifts. Over the past year, previous declarations of \"truces\" and high-level negotiations have only ended in more rounds of tariffs imposed.\n\nBut even though the actual terms of the deal are relatively limited and still not finalised, the markets will see it as offering a possible exit from the stalemate that seemed to have frozen solid in both Washington and Beijing.\n\nThat is because the US will no longer increase tariffs from 25 per cent to 30 per cent on $US250 billion of Chinese imports that had been due to start this Tuesday.\n\nYet no existing tariffs imposed over the past 18 months have been lifted, including 15 per cent levies on a further $US110 billion of goods that took effect last month. The US is also not removing the threat of 15 per cent tariffs on a new batch of Chinese goods, including many consumer products, on December 15.\n\nNor is there any indication yet of any softening of a ban on US companies supplying products to Huawei or a range of other Chinese technology companies after they were put on a US blacklist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntense competition in high tech and concerns over security issues and human rights in China had become part of the general trade stand-off, amid talk of a \"de-coupling\" of the two economies.\n\nThe hostile Chinese reaction to a tweet by the general manager of a popular NBA team supporting Hong Kong demonstrators has also demonstrated to sports-loving Americans the harsh reality of Chinese censorship and commercial retaliation.\n\nBut it seems something as fundamental and distinctly low tech as pork supplies in China and pork farmers in the US can still exert their own powerful force over both leaders.\n\nXi Jinping faces his own domestic pressures, making a quick deal focused heavily on agricultural imports attractive and urgent given rising food prices. As well as the deliberate reduction in US pork imports, the coincidence of an African swine flu sweeping China and killing pigs has sent the price of port and other meats rocketing.\n\nChina\u2019s third-quarter GDP growth rate to be announced on October 18 may still officially come in above 6 per cent but the economy has been clearly weakening.\n\nThis comes just ahead of an important meeting of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the first since February last year. Xi\u2019s grip on power is tight but there are reports of increasing apprehension about the impact of the trade war within significant sections of the country\u2019s leadership.\n\nSo Xi too will be happy to claim a win - assuming there\u2019s no party push back and no other setback between the announcement of this truce and the actual signing of a deal on the sidelines of the APEC meeting in Chile in mid November.\n\nXi also gets a US reprieve on the continuing chaos in Hong Kong. Trump, again typically, is showing no hesitation in ditching any US interest in protecting pro-democracy protesters, saying he thought \u201cgreat progress\u201d had been made by China there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had observed fewer protesters, the President said confidently, and he expected the problem was \u201cgoing to take care of itself\u201d.\n\n\u201cI actually think this deal is a great deal for the people of Hong Kong to see what happened. I think this is a very positive thing for Hong Kong,\u201d he said, preferring to concentrate on what he called a \u201clove fest\u201d between and Beijing and Washington.\n\nNone of this seems to address tougher rhetoric from the US over issues like China's theft of Western companies' IP or distortion of trade rules or manipulation of its currency.\n\nThe US is suggesting the deal will also include guidelines on how China manages its currency - a Trump obsession - and other Chinese concessions on IP. There is little detail on this and much that can go wrong. Donald Trump won't care. He's selling the art of the deal - and the election.", "description": "Global markets are reacting with enthusiasm to Donald Trump claiming vindication and victory as he announces a deal with China.
