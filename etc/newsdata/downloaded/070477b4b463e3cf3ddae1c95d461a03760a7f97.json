SDC, +7.45% for practices it said put patients at risk, JPMorgan and Siftel initiated coverage of the stock with buy ratings with JPMorgan saying said its business model solves many of the problems that make orthodontics timely and expensive. \"The company sets itself apart from both traditional orthodontics players and direct-to-consumer competitors with (1) the convenience and ease of access it provides over the traditional orthodontics business model; (2) affordable product offerings; (3) a seamless in-house financing option; and (4) complete vertical integration, which drives a best-in-class patient experience,\" JPMorgan analysts led by Robbie Marcus wrote in a note to clients. The analysts assigned the stock a price target of $31 that is more than double its current price of $14.72. The addressable market for straightening teeth is significant, said the note with less than 1% of the company's target market receiving care and a multi-year runway for growth. \"We see a clear path to sustained top-line growth at an almost 50% 2018-23 CAGR, which we view as conservative,\" said the note. Stifel agreed that there is demand for the product, although it took a more cautious stance. \"To be clear, our checks among consumers identified areas of dissatisfaction, as customer service and lack of Doctor oversight were issues for a subset of respondents,\" said Stifel analyst Jonathan Block. \"That said, we saw relatively solid ratings for the overall SDC experience despite these shortcomings, as a straighter smile and whiter teeth at a $2,000 price point seemingly resonated with the majority of the company's customers.\" On Friday, short seller Hindenburg Research said it estimates that the stock has about 85% downside in a damning note outlining practices that are illegal and endanger patients. \"Financially, the company is another profitless, cash incinerating 'unicorn' that we believe has significant added financial headwinds to face as a result of regulatory, legal and customer satisfaction liabilities,\" Hindenburg Founder Nathan Anderson wrote in the report. SmileDirect responded with a statement that hit out at \"organized dentistry.\" \"There is no factual basis nor scientific or medical justification in these allegations to substantiate the false claims made about our model and the state-licensed doctors in our affiliated network,\" the company said. Shares rose 2.9% premarket and are up 6% on the month, but remain 36% below their IPO issue price. The company went public in September.", "description": "Just days after a short-seller slammed SmileDirectClub Inc. for practices it said put patients at risk, JPMorgan and Siftel initiated coverage of the stock...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
