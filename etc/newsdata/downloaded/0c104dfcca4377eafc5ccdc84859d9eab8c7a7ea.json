A photographer captured a look at Huffman on the grounds of Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California, just before her husband William H. Macy and the couple\u2019s 17-year-old daughter Georgia visited.\n\nAll things considered, Huffman looked well. In a photo currently making the rounds on social media, she can be seen walking through the prison yard wearing a jail-issued deep green jumpsuit with a white ball cap and dark tennis shoes. In one photo, it even appears that she is in the prison parking lot, perhaps heading out to meet up with her husband and daughter (although, if that was the case, it begs a few questions about whether minimum security prison is more minimum for celebrities).\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nHuffman is almost already halfway through her 14-day prison sentence, which will actually come out to 13 days spent in prison due to time served for her initial arrest and booking. In addition to serving time at the correctional institution, Huffman was sentenced to 250 hours of community service, a $30,000 fine and supervised release for one year for her charges of mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe is the first parent charged in the shocking college admission scandal \u2014 a $25 million racketeering scheme. Huffman allegedly \u201cdonated\u201d $15,000 to have the SAT answers of her eldest daughter, Sophia Macy, changed in order to give the girl a better score.\n\nThe actress seemed remorseful over her actions at her sentencing, saying, \u201cOn the way to the testing center, I thought to myself, turn the car around. One of the hardest things was after my arrest, my daughter said, \u2018I don\u2019t know who you are anymore.\u2019 I am so sorry, Sophia. I was frightened, I was stupid and I was so wrong. I am deeply ashamed of what I have done. I have inflicted more damage than I could have imagined. I realize that love and truth must go hand in hand.\u201d\n\nHuffman is expected to be released from FCI Dublin next Sunday, on Oct. 27.\n\nBest of SheKnows\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
