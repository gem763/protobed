Sign up here.\n\nThomas Cook Group Plc collapsed under a pile of debt after talks with creditors failed, forcing the British government to charter planes to bring home more than 150,000 of the storied travel provider\u2019s stranded customers.\n\nThe 178-year-old U.K. company filed for insolvency early Monday after eleventh-hour fund-raising talks with investors led by China\u2019s Fosun Tourism Group failed. The move saw all bookings, flights and package tours canceled, sparking online panic for travelers. In what it called the \u201clargest repatriation in peacetime history,\u201d the government said it would work to return travelers over the next two weeks free of cost.\n\nThe company is the highest-profile casualty of a decades-long shift in the travel business. The rise of discount airlines and online booking platforms has encouraged sun-starved Europeans to spurn package-tour operators and arrange their own trips, while the highly seasonal industry has suffered shocks ranging from terrorism to political turmoil.\n\nTrading in Thomas Cook\u2019s stock was suspended in London and its euro bonds plunged 72%. Shares of German rival TUI AG rose as much as 11%, while British Airways parent IAG, Easyjet Plc and Ryanair Holdings Plc got a boost from the prospect of flying home stranded passengers at the U.K. government\u2019s expense, as well as increased bookings down the road.\n\nCondor, Thomas Cook\u2019s German airline, said it will keep operating flights and has applied for a bridge loan from the German government. The company\u2019s German tour operating arm said it\u2019s sounding out \u201cfinal options\u201d and warned that it might have to file for insolvency, too.\n\nThe demise of one of the U.K.\u2019s best-known brands, leaving more than 21,000 jobs at risk, caps months of talks with its investors. Fosun, which owns the Club Med resort chain, proposed a $1.1 billion bailout in exchange for control of Thomas Cook\u2019s tour operations and a minority stake in its airline. Last week, the London-based company said it needed 200 million pounds ($250 million) more, prompting its rescue prospects to unravel.\n\n\u201cAlthough a deal had been largely agreed, an additional facility requested in the last few days of negotiations presented a challenge that ultimately proved insurmountable,\u201d said Chief Executive Officer Peter Fankhauser.\n\nThousands Stranded\n\nTravelers on Thomas Cook vacation packages and flights were advised by the British government not to cut short their trips, with the civil aviation regulator planning to repatriate customers as close as possible to their booked return date. The government will also cover the cost of accommodation for Thomas Cook customers.\n\nAlixPartners LLP was named an adviser and will work with the aviation authority to bring customers back to the U.K.\n\nThe collapse deals another blow to the European travel sector, just months after the bankruptcy of Icelandic budget airline, Wow Air. The carrier shut down its operations in March due to lack of financing, leaving 2,700 fliers stranded and hurting the country\u2019s economy. Two years ago, Monarch Airlines, a U.K. carrier that unsuccessfully tried to switch from charter to scheduled low-cost operations, collapsed.\n\nFosun Tourism Group said in a statement Monday that it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d Thomas Cook was unable to find a solution. Its shares dropped as much as 5.5% in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cFosun confirms that its position remained unchanged throughout the process, but unfortunately other factors have changed,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe extend our deepest sympathy to all those affected.\u201d\n\nHedge Funds\n\nThe last-ditch rescue bid proposed swapping existing debt into shares, leaving Fosun holding the majority of Thomas Cook\u2019s tour-operating business while creditors would have controlled its airlines. The company had almost 2 billion pounds of debt as of March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nBut the challenges eventually proved insurmountable. A group of hedge funds organized to block the plan because it would stop them from cashing in on holdings of swaps that pay out when a company defaults on its debt. There was also concern that customers would avoid Thomas Cook for fear the company wouldn\u2019t be around to honor their bookings.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets?
