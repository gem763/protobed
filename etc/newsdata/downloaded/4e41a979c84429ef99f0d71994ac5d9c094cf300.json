And the fact that the joint pacesetter is a former blue-and-gold hero in Nicolas Colsaerts makes the prospect of a duel yet more appealing.\n\nThe Belgian is one of the game\u2019s more perplexing talents. When the man nicknamed \u201cThe Dude\u201d produced eight birdies and an eagle in his first Ryder Cup match to bring down Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker in the fourballs in 2012, his partner, Lee Westwood, tipped him to \u201cgo on to great things\u201d.\n\nYet, seven years on from the Miracle of Medinah, the 36-year-old has not featured again in Ryder Cup or won since that standout season.\n\nAt 114th on the European Tour order of merit, Colsaerts is fighting for his card and in need of a big week at Le Golf National.\n\nSo far, so, so good. He added a five-under 66 on Friday to add to his opening 67 and, on nine under, shares the lead with the South African George Coetzee, with a shot back to to Kurt Kitayama, the crack 26-year-old California.\n\nBut Colsaerts has been in this position too many times to be certain that the corner has been turned. \u201cI always seem to chuck in a bad nine holes that make me go backwards and leaves a bad taste in my mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen better days, and I\u2019ve been happier. So I want to play well and get this over with and see you all again on Tour next year.\u201d", "description": "Appropriately for the course that staged last year\u2019s Ryder Cup, there is a European and an American high on the France Open leaderboard.", "authors": ["James Corrigan", "Golf Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2019/10/18/213410430_Getty-Images-Europe_Open-de-France-Day-Two-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZRNnYfNPvzEFj1ujY5sk3rbYOgO78E9-YVuknhQWJcY.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
