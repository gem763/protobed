It\u2019s been a year of hell.\u201d\n\nGazza, 52, says he feared being abused in the street and was reduced to tears at the thought of being barred from seeing his young relatives.\n\nHe also reveals he wanted to jump up in court and scream: \u201cI\u2019m no sex offender\u201d.\n\nAnd he maintains he only kissed the woman at the centre of the court case because she was being taunted over her weight by fellow train passengers.\n\n(Image: Jonathan Buckmaster)\n\nTheir jibes brought back terrible memories for ex-Spurs and England star Paul of his bullied nephew\u2019s overdose death at just 22. In his first interview since being found not guilty of sexual assault, Gazza:\n\nSays he feared being branded \u201cworse than Jeffrey Epstein\u201d \u2013 Prince Andrew\u2019s paedophile pal.\n\nWent on all-night exercise binges to stop him drinking ahead of the trial.\n\nClaims cops asked for selfies before letting him go after his initial arrest.\n\nGazza, who has fought a battle with booze for years, was speaking to the Mirror at a hotel suite in Bournemouth \u2013 near his new home in Poole.\n\nHe was dressed in a blue suit and the two-toned brogues he wore to Teesside Crown Court, where a jury took nearly three hours to clear him of sexual assault and assault by beating.\n\n(Image: Andy Commins/Daily Mirror)\n\nGazza looks remarkably healthy and relaxed after the toll of the court case.\n\nDriven by an innate hatred of bullying, he says his only intention when he kissed the woman was to comfort her.\n\nHe talks painfully about being haunted by the death of beloved nephew Jay Kerrigan in 2016. An inquest ruled Jay accidentally overdosed on drugs at his girlfriend\u2019s home. The hearing was told that he had battled mental problems and was tormented by schoolyard bullies.\n\nGazza says: \u201cMy nephew Jay died, he was bullied and I never want to see that happen to someone else.\n\n\u201cAll I was doing was sticking up for the girl.\n\n\u201cI gave the girl a peck. I didn\u2019t mean anything sexual, I just heard what was said to her and wanted to help. If it was anyone else this would never have gone to court. I accept I\u2019m not liked by everyone.\n\n(Image: Jonathan Buckmaster)\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to change the way I behave. I\u2019ve been kissed six times this morning \u2013 does that mean I have been sexually assaulted?\n\n\u201cThe last year has been a nightmare and I\u2019ve worked hard to stay sober, in the last 6 months I\u2019ve not touched a drop.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in trouble but nothing like this. I worried people would stop me going down the high street and shout abuse at me, or stop me from being around their kids.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018Have I let the fans down?\u2019 Being on the sex offenders list \u2013 that\u2019s not me. This is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever been through. There were times when I could have just f***ing locked the door, turned my phones off and just got bladdered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve stayed strong \u2013 I\u2019ve had to. Even talking about this I could walk out and go get p***ed now. But I know alcohol would make it worse.\u201d\n\n(Image: Jonathan Buckmaster)\n\nGazza then refers to Epstein, 66 \u2013 the US billionaire who killed himself while awaiting trial for trafficking girls for sex. He says: \u201cI was worried I\u2019d be treated like Jeffrey Epstein. I\u2019d get worse publicity than Epstein.\u201d The kiss at the centre of the court case happened after Gazza boarded the 17.31 York to Newcastle train on August 20 last year.\n\nHe was on his way to Tyneside after spending a week with his nephews Cameron, 16, and Joe, 14.\n\nIn court Gascoigne was said to have kissed the woman without her consent for four seconds in front of shocked passengers as the train was outside Darlington.\n\nGazza says he had no idea what was about to unfold. He says: \u201cI got back to my hotel and called my sister.\n\n\u201cWhile I was on the phone the police knocked on her door and said \u2018Hi Paul, we want to talk to you about the incident on the train\u2019. I didn\u2019t mean anything nasty by it but I said, \u2018Is this about the fat lass?\u2019 They said they wanted to come see me and I said, \u2018What for? For the peck I did?\u2019\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI said I had done nothing wrong but they wanted to come see me because they said it would be in my best interest.\u201d\n\nGazza was staying at the four star, \u00a3149-a-night Jesmond Dene Hotel in Newcastle.\n\nHe continues: \u201cThe police came to my room and they said, \u2018Did you peck the girl?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes\u2019. Then they read me my rights but didn\u2019t cuff me.\n\n\u201cThey asked if I wanted a lawyer and I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t need one, I\u2019m telling you the truth about what I did, I pecked her because she was called fat and ugly\u2019. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, I know I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nGazza was put in a holding cell for four hours and questioned for 45 minutes. He had his shoes removed, his fingerprints taken and posed for a mugshot.\n\nBut, Gazza says, that wasn\u2019t the only picture. He claims officers asked him to pose for selfies and to relive his classic Euro 96 goal against Scotland.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nGazza goes on: \u201cI was in the back of the police car and they were just talking to me about football.\n\n\u201cOn the way to the station they were talking to me about everything, asking me what my time was like playing for Middlesbrough, about the goal I scored in Euro 96.\n\n\u201cThen they were asking me for selfies after letting me go. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nIt was a full six months before Gazza was charged \u2013 and his lawyers warned him a conviction would place him on the sex offenders register.\n\nGazza recalls: \u201cI just said, \u2018Oh, God\u2019. I still wasn\u2019t worried, because I thought I had done nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cIt was only six weeks before the trial when it hit me. A lot of my friends have kids. I thought, \u2018If I\u2019m on the sex offenders\u2019 list does that mean I can\u2019t be near children?\u2019 I just started crying.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like a kid myself. I get on so well with any kids and I love being around them. I act like kids \u2013 I\u2019m f***ing worse than them.\n\n\u201cThere are so many kids in my life, my nephews, my mates\u2019 kids.\n\n(Image: Jonathan Buckmaster)\n\n\u201cI play with them every chance I get, I love playing football with them. Then it started to hit me hard and I had sleepless nights.\u201d Desperate to avoid caving in to his drink demons, Gazza turned to frenzied exercise sessions.\n\n\u201cI would be up all night doing sit-ups and squats or on the bike,\u201d he says. \u201cAnything to keep my mind busy\n\n\u201cThose weeks before the trial were hard but I had to stay strong.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want people around me, my friends and family, to crumble.\n\n\u201cI just kept it to myself \u2013 that\u2019s the way I am.\n\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why through my life I\u2019ve kept it to myself and ended up hitting the bottle.\n\n\u201cI thought if I get on the sex offenders\u2019 register, people are not going to work\n\nwith me. It was difficult but I had good people around me and I stayed strong. It\u2019s been a year of hell.\u201d\n\nGazza \u2013 who has a son and two stepchildren from his marriage to Sheryl Gascoigne \u2013 was branded a liar in court by prosecutors. But his lawyers produced images showing him kissing stars and dignitaries down the years \u2013 from Princess Diana to Wayne Rooney.\n\nBritish Transport Police yesterday denied Gazza\u2019s allegation that any officer had asked him for selfies.\n\nGazza, meanwhile, is relishing 2020 after a year of hell. He earns a living from live shows and Q&As and is working on an autobiography. And he will be at Euro 2020 \u2013 supporting the England squad as an official UEFA ambassador.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Gazza opens up about his year of hell, and says he only gave girl a 'peck' as she was being bullied", "authors": ["Dan Warburton", "Image", "Jonathan Buckmaster", "Andy Commins Daily Mirror", "Getty Images", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20654757.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JBP_DXX_PAULGASCOIGNE18101941JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
