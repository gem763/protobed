Noting how he\u2019s held 10 years\u2019 worth of town hall meetings and talked with thousands of gun-control activists, he says \u201c90 percent of them\u201d are focused on passing universal background checks\u2014a readily attainable goal that has enormous public support. But now, because of the confiscation talk, \u201cTrump can just say, \u2018They\u2019re all going to take your guns away,\u2019\u201d Bennet says, turning the discussion into a zero-sum game. \u201cAnd the labor guys in Iowa and New Hampshire, that\u2019s what they say. I just heard the same thing in Reno: \u2018You\u2019re going to take our guns away.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis, Bennet fears, is how Trump might luck into a second term. Oh, sure, the president will continue to scare moderates and independents with his erratic behavior. But Bennet wonders if Democrats might scare them even more\u2014what with talk of seizing guns, banning fracking, guaranteeing health coverage to undocumented immigrants, raising taxes across the board, imposing political litmus tests on churches, and of course, eliminating private insurance for more than 150 million people.\n\n\u201cJust listen to this debate,\u201d Bennet says, motioning toward the television. \u201cMedicare for All shouldn\u2019t even have made it to the debate stage. I mean, we\u2019re a free country, and that\u2019s fine. But of the Democrats who won in 2018, in those suburban districts, all but one person won their primary running on the public option\u2014against candidates who supported Medicare for All. I understand this has been Bernie\u2019s thing forever. But for some of the leading candidates to sign on to his bill gave it legitimacy. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
