It was then that Mariza Ruelas realized she was carrying a wanted man.\n\nSaid Ruelas: \u201cThe one question every passenger asks as soon as they get in if they\u2019re talkative is, \u2018What\u2019s the craziest thing that\u2019s ever happened to you'\" as a Lyft driver?\n\nShe said she never had a particularly interesting response -- until this weekend.\n\nRuelas pulled up to a home in Stockton, Calif., and noticed it was surrounded by police cars; it seemed obvious that police were looking for someone.\n\nEventually, a visibly nervous 22-year-old, Michael Magdaleno, got into her car.\n\nALASKA WOMAN GETS 60 YEARS FOR SETTING COUCH ABLAZE WITH BOYFRIEND ON IT\n\n\u201cThe guy was just like: \u2018I\u2019ll pay you cash. I just want to get home.\u2019 You could hear the desperation in his voice,\u201d she told Fox 40. \u201cI kind of already had a gut feeling, like, \u2018This might be the person that they\u2019re looking for.'\"\n\nWhen police confirmed her suspicions by urging her to pull over, Ruelas ordered Magdaleno not to flee. \u201c\u201cI told him, too, I was like, \u2018Don\u2019t you dare run out of this car.\u2019 Because I have kids, I told him, \u2018I\u2019m not trying to get caught in the middle of no gunfire,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nCALIFORNIA MAN CAUGHT WEARING ONLY WOMEN'S LINGERIE DURING HOME BREAK-IN\n\nMagdaleno and his girlfriend, 21-year-old Clarissa Roots, were arrested in connection with a hit-and-run, which occurred just before Magdaleno hailed his Lyft ride. (The person who'd been hit was not severely injured.)\n\nPolice could not immediately be reached for comment, however they told Fox 40 Magdaleno had a bag of cash with him but no drugs or alcohol.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd now?
