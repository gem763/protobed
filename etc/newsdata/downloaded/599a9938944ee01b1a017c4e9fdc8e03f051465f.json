I respect the opinion when people will say we need to change, in or out.\n\n\u201cBut my decision is to stick with players. They have the quality. It\u2019s only to unlock something in their minds.\n\n\u201cIt is not about changing this chair for a sofa and moving the table. We are the same. It is most important to help them; most important to provide calm.\n\n\u201cIt is important that players feel support from the manager. I trust 200 per cent in them and believe they have capacity and potential to win the games.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThis situation happens at all clubs sooner or later. We have confidence we have the quality. It is only matter of time. For them, they are the principal actors on the pitch.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Christian Eriksen is a doubt for Tottenham's clash with Watford this weekend after picking up a dead leg on international duty.\n\nThe Dane will be assessed ahead of Saturday's vital game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nHugo Lloris (arm) is out for the rest of 2019, but Giovani Lo Celso and Ryan Sessegnon have returned to full training.", "description": "Tottenham, beaten 3-0 at Brighton last time out, will look to bounce back against winless bottom club Watford this weekend", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20532686.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-ENG-PR-BRIGHTON-TOTTENHAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
