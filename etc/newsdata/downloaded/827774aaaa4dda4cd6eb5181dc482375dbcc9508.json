It\u2019s one of those films in which a dysfunctional family is forced \u2014 by a wedding, an illness, or a funeral \u2014 to solve all their problems in one weekend. Frankie (Isabelle Huppert) is glamorous and dying. Her husband Jimmy (Brendan Gleeson) is already in mourning. They have two children, but not together; Sylvia (Vinette Robinson) is Jimmy\u2019s daughter, and Sylvia is trying to divorce her husband, Ian (also inexplicably on this holiday). Frankie\u2019s adult son, Paul (J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier), is aimless and troubled, and she\u2019s trying to set him up with her friend and frequent makeup artist, Ilene (Marisa Tomei).\n\nFrankie feels like a standard dysfunctional weekend drama \u2014 not quite The Family Stone or Rachel Getting Married \u2014 until it drops the most bizarre bomb: Over tea, Paul opens his heart to Ilene, and explains the root of the quiet but present tension between him and Sylvia. Why would there be awkwardness between these two adult children? Reader: They fucked. A long time ago, and in a galaxy that is actually the very one we live in right now, what started as Sylvia and Paul sitting together and watching Grease on TV turned into Paul applying Sylvia\u2019s sunscreen, which turned into Sylvia and Paul having sex, as adult Paul explains to Marisa Tomei. Frankie and Jimmy walked in on this behavior, and Paul was sent away to live with his father.\n\nThis was an upsetting scene to witness, because Marisa Tomei \u2014 lovely, confused, perfect \u2014 did not ask to hear such a weird story nor did she deserve to hear such a weird story. In response, she sort of sighs. What is the ideal response? Paul wasn\u2019t really looking for sympathy, but maybe some kind of recognition: He\u2019s lost his mother before, and he\u2019s bracing himself to lose her again, but this time to cancer, not to sister-fucking.\n\nThis season on \u00c9lite, Netflix\u2019s excellent drama about horny, snobby teens, the Blair Waldorf\u2013esque queen bee Lucrecia (Danna Paola) is plagued by the presence of her rambunctious half-brother Valerio (Jorge L\u00f3pez). Valerio is pure id, snorting any drug he can find, and shamelessly flirting with any living creature within a five-mile radius. Lu rolls her eyes and playfully pushes him out of her path, and it seems like regular brother-sister drama \u2026 until Valerio references their secret lovey-dovey history, when they used to kiss in secret before he was exiled from their family\u2019s home. Sure, Lu is in an unstable relationship with a boy in love with another girl, but that doesn\u2019t stop Valerio from pining for her. In some scenes, she relents and allows herself to kiss him.\n\nIn A Simple Favor, maybe the most audacious studio movie of 2018, Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively swap secrets over martinis as their kids have a playdate upstairs. Emily (Lively) says that she and her husband had a threesome with a college TA; Stephanie Smothers (Kendrick) tells the story of her father\u2019s funeral, which happened to be the day she met a brother she didn\u2019t know she had. She and her brother got to talking, and \u2026 well, they fucked, too. \u201cBrotherfucker,\u201d Lively laughs. Then she says it again, the way anyone else on planet Earth would say the word motherfucker. \u201cBruuuuhhhhtherfucker!\u201d In another reality, this is the most quoted line in the history of cinema. In this reality, however, it is just another example of this essay\u2019s central thesis: There are a lot of movies and TV shows these days about sleeping with a man who happens to share your DNA \u2014 a man who happens to be your brother. There\u2019s certainly a precedent: The Lannister twins on Game of Thrones, Cruel Intentions, The Dreamers, Dogtooth. Allow me to put on my Carrie Bradshaw voice, because I can\u2019t help but wonder: Are people really just out in these streets \u2026 fucking their brothers like there\u2019s no tomorrow?\n\nI tried.\n\nAm I alone in this? Do people \u2026 do this? I did some Googling about incest, and nothing really damning came up, in either direction. I thought there would be a Bible verse about this, an occasion where Jesus and/or Moses said: \u201cIt\u2019s super uncool to kiss someone in your family. Like very extremely not cool,\u201d but I didn\u2019t find anything along those lines. \u201cHunter,\u201d my friend (and co-worker, and work dad) Alex said to me, when I brought this up at brunch last Sunday afternoon. \u201cAre you kink-shaming?\u201d I blushed. He then (perhaps over-) intellectualized it: \u201cCould it be, like, the most extreme form of tribalism?\u201d I sighed. Is it worth thinking that deeply about? I really don\u2019t think so! In my mind, it\u2019s pretty simple: If you want to have sex with someone, and that person is your brother, maybe don\u2019t have sex with that person. Easy peasy! (Not that it is at all relevant here, but once upon a time Alex tweeted \u2014 and then deleted \u2014 an observation that boys who went to Brown are the best kissers. Kiss: boys from Brown University. Do not kiss: someone who is from the same womb that you are from.)\n\nReally, I don\u2019t know who needs to hear this but: Please don\u2019t fuck your brother. I didn\u2019t know that needed to be said, but apparently it does. Please don\u2019t fuck your brother. Please don\u2019t fuck your brother. Please don\u2019t fuck your brother. I\u2019m asking nicely: Maybe consider not fucking your brother. Maybe fucking our brothers is something we should all abstain from, I think? I don\u2019t have all the answers. I don\u2019t really know anything for sure. I\u2019m an expert on literally nothing. But it just seems like a concept worth considering: If you\u2019re on the fence about fucking your brother, my professional opinion is that maybe you should be on the side of the fence that does not include fucking a man who happens to be your brother.\n\nMaybe it is a form of tribalism, or maybe incest is the last true taboo, or maybe it is narcissism run amok, or maybe a lot of people in Hollywood are on an email chain about this subject that I am not on. (For what it\u2019s worth, my email address is hunter.harris@nymag.com.) I think any of these things can be true, and perhaps all of them are true.\n\nAnyway. Here is a way to not fuck one\u2019s sibling, which I personally have found to be quite foolproof: If your sibling wants to kiss, do not kiss them. If they say something along the lines of \u201cHaha let\u2019s fuck??? Haha!\u201d give them a small, charitable chuckle, and immediately leave that room. If the brother you didn\u2019t know you had shows up to your father\u2019s funeral and stares longingly into your eyes, say that there are canap\u00e9s that you need to check on in the next room, and make a quick exit. Instead of trying to break up your sister and her boyfriend so you and your sister can get together, find another woman not related to you that you can start a dysfunctional relationship with of your very own. If you and your sister are watching Grease on TV, consider that maybe she just wants to watch and enjoy Grease in silence, and do not try to kiss her. End of instructions!\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this post misidentified Valerio as Lu\u2019s stepbrother. He is her half brother.
