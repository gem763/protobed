REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.42%, having fallen 1.72% so far this week, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei slid 1.27%.\n\nU.S. S&P 500 futures fell 0.2% in Asian trading after the index dropped 0.24% on Thursday.\n\nA whistleblower report released on Thursday said President Donald Trump not only abused his office in attempting to solicit Ukraine\u2019s interference in the 2020 U.S. election for his political benefit, but that the White House tried to \u201clock down\u201d evidence about that conduct.\n\nThe report came after the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi launched an impeachment inquiry into him this week.\n\n\u201cThe start of the impeachment inquiry adds a new element of uncertainties to markets, in addition to ongoing concerns about the U.S.-China trade war and the risk of a U.S. recession,\u201d said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n\n\u201cWhile no one thinks the Senate will vote for his impeachment given the Republican majority there, we could see more new revelations during a long investigation process,\u201d he added.\n\nOn trade issues, news headlines were too mixed for investors to show a clear reaction.\n\nCNBC reported that trade war talks were scheduled for Oct. 10-11 in Washington, citing people familiar with the arrangements, and China\u2019s top diplomat said China was willing to buy more U.S. products.\n\nBut other media reports on Thursday that the United States is unlikely to allow American firms to supply China\u2019s Huawei Technologies undermined hopes of a complete deal between the countries.\n\nThe damage is already evident as Micron Technology Inc, a major Huawei supplier, forecast first-quarter profit below Wall Street targets, pushing its share prices down 7% in after-hours trade.\n\nThat in turn hit chip-related shares in Asia such as Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Tokyo Electron.\n\nIn the currency market, the euro hovered near a 2-1/2-year low amid concerns about sluggish growth in the currency bloc, with rising fear of recession in its biggest economy, Germany.\n\nThe euro stood at $1.0918 after earlier falling to $1.0909, the lowest since May 12, 2017.\n\nThe gloomy outlook in Europe was in contrast to the United States, where despite some pockets of weakness \u2014 such as manufacturing and consumer sentiment \u2014 growth remained relatively robust, with the jobless rate at the lowest in nearly 50 years.\n\nSome market participants suspect the dollar was also helped by continued tightness in dollar funding after U.S. short-term borrowing costs shot up last week.\n\nThe dollar traded at 107.73 yen, after climbing to 107.96 on Thursday.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2330 , near two-week low of $1.2303 hit on Thursday, as investors waited for the British parliament\u2019s next attempt to break the Brexit impasse.\n\nThe Mexican peso weakened to a 2-1/2-week low of 19.680 to the dollar after Mexico\u2019s central bank cut its key interest rate on Thursday, with more cuts seen on the horizon.\n\nOil prices fell on Friday as signs of the rapid return of output from Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest exporter, after a Sept. 14 attack on its production facilities reduced concerns about potential supply disruptions.\n\nBrent crude futures fell 0.83% to $62.22 a barrel but stayed above Wednesday\u2019s low of $61.23, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude lost 0.44% to $56.16 per barrel, off their low of $55.41 on Thursday.", "description": "Asian shares slipped to three-week lows on Friday as the release of a whistleblower complaint against U.S. President Donald Trump added to uncertainties about the global economy, already reeling from the China-U.S. trade war.", "authors": ["Hideyuki Sano", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434355703&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q02V", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
