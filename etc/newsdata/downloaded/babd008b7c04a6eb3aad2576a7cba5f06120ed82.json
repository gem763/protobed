Devin Nunes said on Thursday that Democrats enlisted the mainstream media to gin up a \u201cfake story\u201d to get President Trump impeached.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate the Democrats on the rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president, and their extraordinary ability once again to enlist the mainstream media in their campaign,\u201d Nunes, the Intelligence committee ranking member, said in a fiery opening statement during Thursday's hearing with the director of national intelligence. The hearing was called to discuss the whistleblower complaint that touched off the latest impeachment push.\n\nINTEL CHIEF MAGUIRE DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, CALLS ISSUE \u2018UNPRECEDENTED\u2019\n\n\u201cThis operation began with media reports -- from the prime instigators of the Russian collusion hoax -- that a whistleblower is claiming President Trump made a nefarious \u2018promise\u2019 to a foreign leader,\u201d Nunes continued. \u201cThe released transcript of the call has already debunked that central assertion, but that didn\u2019t matter. The Democrats simply moved the goalposts and began claiming that there doesn\u2019t need to be a quid pro quo for this conversation to serve as the basis for impeaching the president.\u201d\n\nThe top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee then blasted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for saying Democrats have other \u201ccandidates for impeachable offenses\u201d if the latest controversy didn't meet the bar. At issue in the complaint was Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president in which he sought an investigation of the Biden family. A transcript of the call released by the White House confirmed that request but did not show Trump explicitly leveraged U.S. aid as initially suggested in reports.\n\nREAD THE WHISTLEBLOWER'S COMPLAINT\n\n\u201cSo, there you go. If their whistleblower operation doesn\u2019t work out, the Democrats and their media assets can always drum up something else,\u201d Nunes said.\n\nNunes then listed a series of issues with both the whistleblower and the complaint, such as the inspector general finding \u201carguable political bias\u201d against Trump.\n\n\u201cSo, once again, this supposed scandal ends up being nothing like what we were told. And once again, the Democrats, their media mouthpieces, and a cabal of leakers are ginning up a fake story, with no regard to the monumental damage they\u2019re causing to our public institutions and to trust in government, and without acknowledging all the false stories they propagated in the past,\u201d Nunes said.\n\nNunes said the media used the same playbook for countless allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.\n\nMEDIA 'MOVE THE GOALPOSTS' AFTER RELEASE OF TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to forget about all those stories but believe this one,\u201d he said.\n\nNunes said that Democrats want a public spectacle, as opposed to actual answers \u201cso we\u2019ve been treated to an unending parade of press releases, press conferences, and fake news stories.\u201d He said the hearing should have been conducted behind closed doors but that \u201conly makes sense when your goal is to get information, not to create a media frenzy.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNunes ended his opening statement by saying Democrats \u201cshould end this entire dishonest, grotesque spectacle and get back to solving problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudging by today\u2019s charade, however, the chances of that happening anytime soon are zero to none,\u201d he said.", "description": "California\u00a0Rep.
