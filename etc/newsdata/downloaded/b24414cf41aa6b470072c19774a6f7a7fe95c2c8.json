More often than not, though, word arrives through a special email portal, or by text to a smartphone. The sender always says the same thing: \u201cYour payments have been suspended.\u201d\n\nIt happened to Keelan two months ago. He got a notification on his MyGov account, the online portal he uses to receive emails from Centrelink, Australia\u2019s social security agency.\n\nThe 26-year-old has been surviving on Australia\u2019s jobseekers\u2019 payment, Newstart allowance, ever since his medical conditions \u2013 anxiety, depression and OCD \u2013 started affecting his studies.\n\nHis payments \u2013 A$600 a fortnight \u2013 were automatically stopped because he missed a phone appointment. It mattered little that he was not in a great state at the time.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what day it was because my OCD was quite bad,\u201d Keelan tells the Guardian. \u201cI got a phone call that I didn\u2019t register. It turned out to be Centrelink and they cut off my payments. And I didn\u2019t hear from them again after that.\u201d\n\nKeelan, who did not want his surname published, says he spent hours on the phone over several days trying to get his welfare payments back. Most of the money was delayed for about a week. He was broke and couldn\u2019t afford his medication.\n\nWhen he doesn\u2019t take his meds, \u201cit sort of throws off my day-to-day function to the point where I can\u2019t complete a sentence,\u201d he says. \u201cMy condition just gets worse and I go into a downward spiral where I need to go into care sometimes.\u201d\n\nThese suspensions are becoming increasingly common and will be considered by the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, who is examining the impact of digital technology on social safety nets around the world.\n\n\u2018People are left without anywhere to turn\u2019\n\nAustralia\u2019s welfare system is often touted by its politicians as the most efficient and the envy of the world.\n\nBureaucrats and politicians alike have embraced technology and automation with open arms. As part of a sweeping digitisation push slated to finish in 2022, benefits claims are now conducted online. Since 2013, welfare recipients have been pushed away from Centrelink shop fronts and on to the MyGov online portal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The text warning welfare recipients their payments are suspended. Photograph: Tony McDonough\n\nThe centre-right coalition government is already facing legal action over its Robodebt scheme, which critics say uses a flawed algorithm to accuse benefits recipients of owing a welfare debt. But there have been other, less-remarked-upon changes, too.\n\nLast year, the government overhauled the way it sanctions welfare recipients accused of gaming the system. In a briefing to the privately run job service agencies that administer the new policies, an official summed up the changes: \u201cProcesses will be automated as much as possible to simplify administration.\u201d\n\nWelfare advocates say the consequences have been disastrous. In the space of a year, the new policy has increased the number of welfare payment suspensions to 2.7m.\n\nIn 12 months, welfare payments were stopped an extra 1m times.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a shifting of decision-making that is increasing the amount of automatic suspensions,\u201d says the policy analyst Simone Casey.\n\nUnder the most recent changes, the government has prioritised welfare suspensions over sanctions, in which a person has their payments docked for doing the wrong thing. These penalties, which used to be applied manually by a staff member, have dropped significantly. Instead, a recipient\u2019s money is cut off automatically until they satisfy their job agency consultant that they are committed to looking for work.\n\nCasey, who used to engage with the government regularly in her work as a policy analyst adviser to not-for-profit job agencies, says that over time consultants have been handed less decision-making power over how to penalise \u2013 or not \u2013 the welfare recipients they are employed to help.\n\nConsultants have less discretion when a welfare recipient does not turn up to an appointment or misses another compulsory activity. They enter a code into a system that automatically triggers a payment suspension.\n\nThe same goes when the welfare recipient fails to report their income or confirm they met their job search requirements via digital channels.\n\nMoney is stopped first, and questions are asked later. The idea is that this will encourage people to follow the rules.\n\n\u201cIn some cases it\u2019s left single parents without money for food for their children over a weekend because they haven\u2019t logged in and reported their attendance,\u201d says Adrianne Walters, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre.\n\n\u201cAnd so the computer says, \u2018No payments\u2019. And then that person is left without anywhere to turn until their employment service provider opens up again on the Monday.\u201d\n\nThe National Social Security Rights Network represents community legal centres who take calls daily from welfare recipients that feel wronged by the system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing more people call up because of automation,\u201d says Jai Manoharachandran, a policy officer at the network.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck, every little bit counts. And the idea that you might have to try and stretch your income for a few days before you get back-paid, it\u2019s incredibly stressful for clients. They often don\u2019t understand why their payments have been suspended.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rebecca Johnson at her home in Perth\u2019s south-eastern suburbs. Photograph: Tony McDonough/The Guardian\n\nRebecca Johnson, 39, lives in Perth, in Western Australia, with her 21-year-old son. He has autism and also receives government benefits. She says she \u201chonestly can\u2019t remember\u201d how many times her payments have been suspended.\n\nSince the new policies were introduced, about 50,000 suspension notifications now go out to welfare recipients across the country each week.\n\nWhen they contact their job agency, the consultant decides whether or not they had a fair reason for missing their appointment. If not, they are given \u201cdemerit point\u201d, which can lead to harsher penalties.\n\nBut analysis of government statistics by the Guardian shows about 75% of the time, benefits recipients who had their payments suspended under the new system were not at fault. The data shows payments were suspended 2.7m times in 12 months, but only 654,ooo demerits were handed out.\n\nParentsNext: 80% of recipients who had payments suspended not at fault, data shows Read more\n\nThe Guardian has tracked the new system since it was rolled out, finding that the homeless and single parents are disproportionately impacted. In six months, 55,000 homeless people received a suspension; yet there are only about 60,000 homeless people receiving welfare at any given time.\n\nMeanwhile, across a controversial welfare-to-work program for single parents with children under five, 85% had their payments suspended automatically but were later cleared of wrongdoing. The overwhelming majority were single mothers.\n\nOn one occasion, Johnson says she had her welfare cut after she was given four phone appointments with her job agency over 10 days.\n\n\u201cI was at work and they just kept changing them with no contact,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThere was no contact as to what was really going on. Just I kept getting these text messages saying that you\u2019ve got appointment on this day, you got an appointment on this day.\u201d\n\nThe last text in the chain, shown to the Guardian, says: \u201cYour payment has been suspended for not attending your provider appointment. To restore payment you need to attend a provider appointment.\u201d\n\nThe government says payments are turned back on once people re-engage with the system. But observers say it doesn\u2019t always work like this in practice.\n\nManoharachandran tells the story of one client who was already broke when her welfare payments were suspended.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t have money for the train to go to her job service provider,\u201d he says. \u201cShe had no money for food or other essentials. So basically, she needed to get the suspension lifted as soon as possible. She ended up riding the train without a ticket and picking up a $200 fine.\n\n\u201cAnd then when she got to the provider, they initially told her they couldn\u2019t see her that day and she\u2019d have to come back the next day to re-engage and get that suspension lifted. She didn\u2019t even have the money to get home. She\u2019d already incurred a $200 fine getting there.\u201d\n\nFor Johnson, the suspensions mean stress and hoop-jumping at best. Other times, it\u2019s much worse. \u201cYou virtually have no money left,\u201d she says of living on Australia\u2019s unemployment benefit, which is among the lowest in the OECD.\n\nThe last time her payments were suspended, she had no money for the weekend. And it wasn\u2019t even her fault: a system glitch with the digital app meant she could not report her income to Centrelink.\n\n\u201cYou try and do the right things, you still get punished,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I see it.\n\n\u2018The system is geared to be very aggressive\u2019\n\nThe most vocal critic of this system has been Rachel Siewert, a senator with the Australian Greens.\n\n\u201cThe system is geared to be very aggressive towards job seekers, and people looking for work,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is what we predicted would happen given the way the system is set up.\u201d\n\nOver time, people receiving benefits in Australia have been given more responsibilities. Increasingly, this involves using technology \u2013 an online portal or smartphone app \u2013 to regularly report information back to the government.\n\nThe government has also established a trial for welfare recipients engaging with job agencies. In time, it hopes a large proportion of them will not go into an office for help and will instead deal with their consultant using an online platform.\n\nSiewert is not convinced it will work. \u201cI\u2019m not having a go at technology but that it can make it harder,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve also got certain groups of people that don\u2019t have the same digital skills.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying older all older people don\u2019t understand technology, but many of them don\u2019t. They\u2019re finding themselves unemployed, later in their career, they may have been involved in an industry that didn\u2019t have to become particularly technically literate, and they are also being alienated through the approach.\u201d\n\nThe same goes for Johnson\u2019s son, whose autism means he struggles to navigate the increasingly digital system. He sometimes forgets to report his income to Centrelink. That does not trigger a phone call asking him what happened, just a payment suspension.\n\nZombie debts are hounding struggling Americans. Will you be next? Read more\n\n\u201cI have to remind him so we don\u2019t get paid for a day or two later until you report,\u201d Johnson says.\n\nThe government is convinced the new system is working. Despite the huge increase in welfare payment suspensions, it says most people end up having their payments restored before they are delayed.\n\nMoreover, the new system has one clear benefit in its eyes. It is expected to save a few hundred million dollars.\n\nCritics say the true cost is felt by people engaging with the system. Walters, of the Human Rights Law Centre, points to a study by researchers from the University of York that found welfare penalties were ineffective.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s that starting point, you\u2019ve got a program that is causing the stress to Australian families,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when you automate that programme, we automate the decision-making, you essentially turbo-charge those impacts.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s phone and email are full of messages telling her about her suspensions. She argues she should at least have a phone conversation with someone before her income is stopped.\n\nBut she\u2019s used to getting those notifications now. What does she think when she gets the news?\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know I probably just, \u2018Again?\u2019 There\u2019s always something,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never-ending. \u2018What have I done this time?\u2019 Or just another drama to deal with. \u2018I don\u2019t have time for this crap.\u2019 That\u2019s what I feel like.\u201d", "description": "In 12 months, Australian welfare payments were stopped an extra 1m times thanks to automated technologies.
