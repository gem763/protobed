Gabbard also alleged there has been a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d to destroy her reputation since she announced her presidential run in January.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me,\u201d Gabbard tweeted about Clinton. \u201cDon\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.\u201d\n\nThere is lingering trepidation in the Democratic party of a repeat of the 2016 race, when Russia interfered in an effort to help Donald Trump defeat Clinton. US intelligence agencies have warned that Russia intends to meddle in 2020. Russian president Vladimir Putin has mocked that possibility, joking earlier this month that Moscow would \u201cdefinitely intervene\u201d.\n\nDuring a Democratic debate on Tuesday, Gabbard criticized a commentator who she said called her \u201can asset of Russia\u2019. She called the comments \u201ccompletely despicable\u201d.\n\nWithout naming Gabbard, Clinton seemed to echo the commentator\u2019s remark during a podcast appearance this week on Campaign HQ with David Plouffe. Plouffe was campaign manager for Barack Obama in 2008 and a senior adviser to the president.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians,\u201d Clinton said, referring to the person she had earlier identified as a woman \u201cwho\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary\u201d.\n\n\u201dThey have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d\n\nClinton also called Trump \u201cVladimir Putin\u2019s dream\u201d. She went on to say Trump\u2019s inauguration speech was \u201clike a declaration of war on half of America\u201d. Clinton also described 2016 Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein as \u201ca Russian asset\u201d.\n\nWill Ocasio-Cortez's Sanders endorsement shake up the 2020 race? Read more\n\nThe Russians know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, Clinton added.\n\nGabbard said on CBSN she \u201cwill not be leaving the Democratic party. I will not be running as an independent or a third-party candidate.\u201d\n\nStein, who ran against Trump and Clinton, received about 1% of the vote in the 2016 election. But some Democrats said her candidacy syphoned votes from Clinton and helped Trump win, particularly in states like Wisconsin.\n\nThe Senate intelligence committee asked Stein for documents as part of its probe into Russian interference in the election because she attended a 2015 dinner in Moscow sponsored by Russian television network RT, with Putin. Stein has said she attended \u201cwith a message of Middle East peace, diplomacy and cooperation\u201d.\n\nIn a tweet on Friday, Stein accused Clinton of \u201cpeddling conspiracy theories to justify her failure instead of reflecting on real reasons Dems lost in 2016\u201d.", "description": "2016 candidate implies 2020 hopeful \u2018favorite of the Russians\u2019 before congresswoman fires back in extraordinary intra-party spat", "authors": ["Associated Press In Washington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ab786ad8bf1d83797e8440bc32561ef41928c34/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=194713d86386a8219e8c49721e5f2ad8", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
