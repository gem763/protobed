significantly more investment, the government would miss its net-zero target and leave the next generation with a \u201cplanet-sized debt\u201d.\n\nLabour MP Matthew Pennycook described the funding as a \u201cstaggering failure to act\u201d on the climate crisis.\n\nHe tweeted: \u201cThe Committee on Climate Change has made clear that 2 per cent of GDP needs to be directed towards decarbonisation if we are to meet our 2050 net-zero target. Yet the chancellor today only allocated \u00a330m towards it. A staggering failure to act.\u201d\n\nRebecca Newsom, Greenpeace\u2019s head of politics, said Boris Johnson had fallen \u201cwoefully short of addressing the single biggest issue of our time\u201d.\n\nShe said the statement \u201cmissed the opportunity and simply kicked the can down the road\u201d, adding: \u201cWe cannot allow the net-zero target to become just another empty politician\u2019s promise. All other long-term investments become worthless if we don\u2019t protect the life-support systems our survival depends on.\u201d\n\nIn July, Lord Deben, chair of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), compared the UK\u2019s efforts to slash carbon emissions to a scene out of the 1970s sitcom Dad\u2019s Army.\n\nThe independent body said Britain had delivered just one of 25 critical policies to get greenhouse gas reductions on track over the past year.\n\nThe government is doing less to help homes and businesses cope with the challenges of a warming climate than it was 10 years ago, despite declaring a climate change emergency in May, the CCC suggested.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He tweeted: \u201cYes \u2013 it would have been lovely to see bigger steps today, but the political and fiscal constraints were pretty restrictive for it.\u201d\n\nAndrea Leadsom, the business secretary, said the \u00a330m would mean the UK continues to \u201clead the world in tackling this critical issue\u201d.\n\nAnother \u00a330m for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) will be going into biodiversity, but Tony Juniper, the chair of Natural England, said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d by the amount.\n\nThe non-departmental public body sponsored by Defra is responsible for ensuring that England\u2019s land, flora and fauna, freshwater and marine environments, geology and soils are protected and improved.\n\nNatural England\u2019s grant-in-aid has been cut by nearly 50 per cent over the past five years.\n\nMr Juniper tweeted: \u201cWe will do our best with slender resources, but we cannot do what is needed without increased investment.\u201d\n\nMartin Harper, the global conservation director of the RSPB, said it highlighted the \u201cmassive gap between ambition to restore nature in a generation\u201d, adding that public investment in biodiversity has been declining for a decade.\n\nMore than half of Britons (52 per cent) think the government should be spending more on the environment, while only 8 per cent think it should be spending less, recent polling by Opinium suggested.\n\nA Defra spokesperson said: \u201cThe \u00a330 million allocated to improving biodiversity will enable us to support the maintenance and restoration of vital habitats for wildlife, and progress nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n\n\u201cThis will form a vital part of our work to deliver our ground-breaking 25-Year Environment Plan, which sets ambitious goals for nature in England to improve our precious environment.\u201d", "description": "Money promised by the\u00a0government to help the country meet its\u00a02050\u00a0net-zero\u00a0target is just 0.1 per cent of what is required, environmental experts have warned.
