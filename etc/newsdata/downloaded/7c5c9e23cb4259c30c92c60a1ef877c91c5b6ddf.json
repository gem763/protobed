Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bills into law September 10.\n\nDalelio was one of dozens of anti-vaccine protesters in the chamber on the 13th. Others had been seated quietly with their fists raised for more than an hour before the incident. A Facebook profile matching Dalelio contained multiple anti-vaccine postings, the Times noted.\n\nAs Dalelio showered the chamber with blood, the Senators were voting on a bill related to sexual harassment. Someone was heard yelling \u201cthis is for dead babies\u201d at the time.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol quickly arrested Dalelio. In a later statement, the CHP said that the blood-like substance she threw had been contained in \u201ca feminine hygiene device,\u201d which witnesses described as a menstrual cup. Dalelio was booked into Sacramento County Jail on six charges including assault, vandalism, and disorderly conduct. She was released the next morning.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities roped off the contaminated area, and lawmakers reconvened in a nearby committee room. The Senate gallery and floor have been closed ever since.\n\nState Sen. Richard Pan (D-Sacramento), who wrote the two bills on vaccine exemptions, said that blood landed on his desk and back as well as other lawmakers\u2019 heads.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Dr. Pan has been the target of anti-vaccine protesters. In August, a prominent anti-vaccine advocate named Kenneth Austin Bennett livestreamed his assault on Pan as they encountered each other on a sidewalk near the state capitol.\n\n\u201cEveryone is pretty disturbed and upset,\u201d Pan said after Dalelio\u2019s attack. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019ve been saying: violent rhetoric turns to violent acts. This is a direct attack on the democratic process, and this should be condemned by everyone. This needs to stop.\u201d\n\nIn a document sent to lawmakers Wednesday, Secretary of the Senate Erika Contreras reported that \u201clab tests confirmed that the substance thrown from the Senate gallery was human blood.\u201d She added that it tested negative for any bloodborne pathogens and infections.\n\nContreras also reported that the Senate chamber had been thoroughly sanitized and confirmed clean by a company certified in hazardous cleanups. It reopened Wednesday.", "description": "Witnesses reported that the blood was thrown from a menstrual cup.", "authors": ["Beth Mole"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-151039097-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
