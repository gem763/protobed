He was surrounded by his family, close friends and members of his boxing team, including his mentor, friend and trainer Joe Higgins.

All I ever wanted to do was win. If I could take it all back I would no one deserves for this to happen to them. I replay the fight over and over in my head thinking what if this never happened and why did it happen to you. I can't stop thinking about it myself I prayed for you so many times and shedded so many tears because I couldn't even imagine how my family and friends would feel. I see you everywhere I go and all I hear is wonderful things about you. I thought about quitting boxing but I know that's not what you would want I know that you were a fighter at heart so I decided not to but to fight and win a world title because that's what you wanted and thats what I want so I'll use you as motivation every day and make sure I always leave it all in the ring every time.\"\n\nDay's professional boxing career began in 2013 when he defeated Zachariah Kelley.
