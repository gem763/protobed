So Santopadre taught him the single-handed slice and made him use it for a few months. It stuck.\n\nBerrettini, who is from Rome, also credited advice he\u2019s received from Corrado Barazzutti, whose appearance in the U.S. Open quarterfinals 42 years ago was the only previous time an Italian man made it that far. The country\u2019s women have had more success, including in 2015, when it accounted for both final participants: champion Flavia Pennetta and runner-up Roberta Vinci.\n\nBarazzutti is now Italy\u2019s Davis Cup captain; Berrettini said they speak to each other every day.\n\nHe also gets frequent text messages from another past Italian star from decades ago, 1976 French Open champion Adriano Panatta.\n\n\u201cI have to say,\u201d recalled Berrettini, who plays No. 13 Gael Monfils of France for a semifinal berth, \u201che\u2019s the first one that told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to serve, like, 220 kph (135 mph). I was 16 when I heard that. I was, like, \u2018I don\u2019t know. (But) if you say that, I\u2019m going to trust you.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTEAM MCOCO IS DONE\n\nThe unbeaten streak is over for American teens Coco Gauff and Caty McNally.\n\nGauff, a 15-year-old from Florida, and McNally, a 17-year-old from Ohio, lost 6-0, 6-1 in the third round of doubles at the U.S. Open to the eighth-seeded team of Victoria Azarenka and Ash Barty 6-0, 6-1.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t start off good,\u201d Gauff said, \u201cand I guess that momentum kind of dragged on the whole match.\u201d\n\nIt was the first loss for the pairing who nicknamed themselves Team McCoco: They won the junior doubles title at Flushing Meadows together a year ago, then partnered up to win a WTA doubles trophy at the Citi Open in Washington in August, before picking up two victories in New York, drawing big crowds each time.\n\nBoth teenagers also drew attention in singles, with Gauff making it to the third round before losing to defending champion Naomi Osaka, while McNally exited in the second round but only after pushing Serena Williams to three sets.\n\nAzarenka and Barty will face No. 1 seeds Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic next.\n\n___\n\nCHAMPION\u2019S CHEERS\n\nNaomi Osaka thought her emotional interview after her match against Coco Gauff at the U.S. Open would only be seen by those who watched it in-person.\n\nShe was surprised to realize it had been seen by many, many more.\n\n\u201cYeah, definitely didn\u2019t expect it to blow up like that,\u201d Osaka said.\n\nFollowing her 6-3, 6-0 victory in the third round, Osaka asked the 15-year-old Gauff to remain on the court with her for an interview in which both players were in tears - as were some folks inside Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\n\u201cObviously what Naomi did is what a true champion would do,\u201d said No. 13 seed Belinda Bencic, who ended Osaka\u2019s title defense by beating her 7-5, 6-4 in the fourth Monday in Ashe.\n\nOsaka thought she noticed some extra support from spectators.\n\n\u201cDefinitely felt like people were cheering for me more, which I appreciate,\u201d Osaka said. \u201cYeah, it was kind of unexpected.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it wouldn\u2019t have been if she had been paying more attention to social media over the weekend.\n\nOsaka said she had her notifications turned off, so she wasn\u2019t aware of how many people had been reacting to her gesture.\n\n\u201cBut, yeah, I was kind of surprised,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I just thought it was for the people in there, like, the stands.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Brian Mahoney contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The first man from Italy to reach the U.S. Open quarterfinals since 1977 might have an old wrist injury to thank.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/02/aptopix_us_open_tennis_91398_c0-48-5327-3153_s1770x1032.jpg?b2c56a89312881936fb03fddb39c16617606fda6"}
