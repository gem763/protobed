Presented by S&P Global\n\nWhat. A. Day. Get ready for another crazy one.\n\nTHE ZIP CODE 10017 might be the only in the Western world where news of a presidential impeachment inquiry in the United States didn\u2019t cause an immediate stir.\n\nIt\u2019s not that U.N.-world doesn\u2019t care: It\u2019s that special forces of gravity apply here. In the words of one senior U.N. official, \u201cBeing here brings all these leaders down a peg. They all look a little bit lost, because for once they are not the center of attention.\u201d In this environment of endless motorcades, security lines and preplanned lectures, Twitter and cable news are not the dominant forces of conversation.\n\nRest assured, U.N.-world caught up with normal world by Tuesday dinner. Playbook\u2019s UNGA Tuesday evening was spent surrounded by former presidents and prime ministers in their sixties who couldn\u2019t hold a table conversation -- because they spent most of the meal glued to their phones searching for Donald Trump updates. If that sounds weird, remember that Greta Thunberg doesn\u2019t act like a regular teenager, so there\u2019s no reason the politicians should live up to their stereotypes either.\n\nHello again from New York City, where POLITICO\u2019s delegation to the U.N. General Assembly is as breathless as everyone else trying to keep up with the blur of political news. There\u2019s everything from sledgehammers against multilateralism to sidewalk diplomacy, stunning British court cases to jaw-dropping Ukranian bullying allegations.\n\nWhile President Trump argues that the U.S is doing better than ever, and that any impeachment proceedings will be politically positive for him, you can still expect today to be total chaos. Inside Trump\u2019s world, there\u2019s a clash between public defiance and private anxiety, writes Nancy Cook.\n\n\n\n\n\nA message from S&P Global: Providing essential data requires that we go beyond the balance sheet. At S&P Global our ESG solutions offer financially relevant analytics and timely data to assess risk, uncover opportunities and inform long term sustainable growth across multiple sectors and markets. Click here for more details.\n\nTrump, Ukraine and Impeachment\n\nMEETING OF THE YEAR: One source of the chaos will be Trump\u2019s plan to meet this afternoon \u2014 around 2:15 p.m. Eastern \u2014 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the man he\u2019s accused of bullying into investigating the family of Joe Biden, under threat of losing U.S. financial assistance. Ukraine adviser Kurt Volker, American Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and Mike Pompeo are also slated to attend the sensitive Ukraine meeting.\n\nImpeachment backstory: Trump withdrawing aid to Ukraine on July 25 was the last step in a \u201cmonths-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists \u2014 including the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani,\u201d WaPo reported. No word on whether Rudy will attend today\u2019s bilat with Zelenskiy.\n\nThe rest of Trump\u2019s dance card: Trump is also set to hold a press conference (4 p.m. Eastern), meet with other leaders to discuss Venezuela, and with Japan\u2019s Shinz\u014d Abe \u2014 hopefully to announce a mini-trade deal.\n\nLeader Watch\n\nToday sees a swing back toward the big non-politician names at UNGA, with the Gates Foundation\u2019s Goalkeepers conference and Bloomberg\u2019s business forum. But the corridor chatter will be all Trump and Iran.\n\nIRAN AND MACRON\u2019S SHUFFLE DIPLOMACY: An energetic burst of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s brand of diplomacy couldn\u2019t overcome the enmity between Washington and Tehran that has been building since, er, the French president was born in the late 1970s.\n\nMacron spent Tuesday scurrying from U.N. headquarters to nearby hotels and back, hoping to pull a diplomatic rabbit out of a hat by convincing Trump and his counterpart, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, to meet face-to-face and begin talks.\n\nMacron bumped into Boris Johnson at the Millennium Hilton, across from U.N. headquarters, where the Frenchman had managed to slip in to see Rouhani just before the British PM\u2019s scheduled bilateral meeting. Macron told Johnson that failure to arrange a meeting \u201cis a lost opportunity,\u201d observers said. \u201cBecause he will not come back in a few months. And President Trump will not go to Tehran. So they have to meet now.\u201d Johnson then told Rouhani, \u201cI think I agree with Emmanuel ... you need to be on the side of the swimming pool and jump at the same time.\n\nEven with the assist of an impromptu Angela Merkel-Rouhani meeting, that didn\u2019t happen before Macron took off for Paris shortly before midnight. Macron did, however, convince Johnson that Trump and Rouhani should meet this week.\n\nIran deal parties meeting this morning: The remaining parties to the Iran nuclear deal are meeting this morning with a press conference expected at 9.30 a.m., a fact EU foreign policy honcho Federica Mogherini announced at a cocktail reception hosted on Tuesday evening by the EU representation to the U.N. She called the meeting \u201cthe best proof\u201d that the \u201cdeal is still in place,\u201d though it comes on the back of France, Germany and the U.K. attributing to responsibility to Iran for the Sept. 14 drone strikes on Saudi oil assets.\n\nTrump wants Iran to make deeper commitments related to controls on its nuclear program and to curtail its role in regional military conflicts. The Iranians first want Trump to lift economic sanctions that he re-imposed when he pulled out of the nuclear accord. Read more on how Trump can escape his Iran jam.\n\nVENEZUELA: While Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is in Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump will meet with Latin American leaders to discuss the situation in Caracas.\n\nLeader Speech Previews\n\nCatch up on how it happened here: POLITICO\u2019s team of six reporters covering the U.N. provided live analysis here.\n\nGLOBALISTS VERSUS PATRIOTS: We saw our first glimpse of low-energy President Trump Tuesday. The U.S. president stuck to his teleprompter and got zero reaction from his audience, putting some of them to sleep. What Trump did manage to do was draw a clear line across our collective political consciousness, the one that suggests you must choose between being a globalist and being a patriot. \u201cIf you want freedom, take pride in your country. If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty. If you want peace, love your nation,\u201d he said, urging every country to put their own first. \u201cThe future does not belong to globalists, it belongs to patriots.\"\n\nLeaving aside Trump\u2019s global business portfolio, U.N. officials scoffed at what they see as Trump\u2019s artificial choice: they say they\u2019re running an organization made up of national government members, with little budget and power, not a cabal of self-appointed world leaders. More on the clash between U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and Trump\u2019s vision\u2019s here.\n\n\u2014 Other leaders including Spain\u2019s Pedro S\u00e1nchez, and New Zealand\u2019s Jacinda Ardern pushed back against the idea of marginalizing the United Nations in their speeches.\n\nRead this: Realists Not Globalists: What U.S. Critics Get Wrong About the U.N, by Richard Gowan.\n\nBen Chang, Princeton University\u2019s spokesperson and a former U.S. diplomat to the U.N., writes that there are two United Nations: the one that hosted the climate summit at which Greta Thunberg starred, and the U.N. made up of dues-paying members \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 whose leaders question climate change and whose policies Greta seeks to change.\n\nAlso read: Don\u2019t cede the U.N. to China, by House Foreign Affairs Lead Republican Michael McCaul.\n\nMACRON\u2019S TALKING POINTS: The French president urged the U.S. and Iran to resume negotiations, and for the world to help save the Amazon. Macron \u2014 a strong believer in markets \u2014 said today\u2019s \u201ccapitalism is dysfunctional\u201d because of \u201ca level of inequalities that is unprecedented.\u201d\n\nBOLSONARO\u2019S BACKLASH: Journalists and pundits panned Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro over the Amazon fires. He wore the clothes of a great environmentalist, while at the same time rejecting new protections and new help for the Amazon and its indigenous people.\n\nIdea of the day: Foreign governments and philanthropists directly paying indigenous people from the Amazon region to keep minerals in the ground, trees in the soil, and to manage the overall resource. The source of the idea: a CEO of a global company, who asked to remain anonymous, responding to Bolsonaro\u2019s speech.\n\nBORIS AND BREXIT BRIEF: British PM Boris Johnson arrives back in London this morning to face a growing constitutional crisis (never mind the new travel and public funds scandal). While Johnson has been found in stunning breach of Britain\u2019s unwritten constitution for his suspension of parliament, that doesn\u2019t automatically mean he\u2019ll lose his job or that Brexit will be delayed beyond October 31.\n\nWhy? The opposition Labour party remains hopelessly divided on Brexit, and Johnson has much better net approval ratings than Labour\u2019s leader Jeremy Corbyn, putting him in a good position to run a \u201cPeople vs. Parliament and Courts\u201d campaign when the inevitable election is finally called.\n\nTeam Boris is also still insisting their UNGA trip was a big success, based on his climate and Iran interventions.\n\nRead this: Everything you need to know about the U.K. court ruling, by POLITICO\u2019s Annabelle Dickson, Emilio Casalicchio and Charlie Cooper.\n\nAnd this: How long can Boris Johnson cling onto power for? by Luke McGee\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.N.'s Global Goals\n\nBack in 2015, U.N. members agreed on 17 goals that would serve as a blueprint for their efforts to secure a peaceful, sustainable future. The deadline is 2030.\n\nWHY GLOBAL GOALS MATTER: As the U.N. Development Programme puts it, using language lifted directly from anti-poverty campaign kits, \u201c26 people on Earth own the same wealth as 3.8 billion people who make up the poorest half of humanity.\u201d\n\nStatus update: The U.N. has tended to paint a rosier picture than outsiders about how well the world is doing in meeting its development goals. Secretary General Antonio Guterres changed that Tuesday evening: \u201cThe Global Goals are our blueprint for a fair globalization. But we are far from where we need to be. We are off track.\u201d\n\nWhat others say:\n\nThe Goalkeepers Report from the Gates Foundation argues for a greater focus on extreme poverty, and says that gender and geography are the biggest factors in stacking the deck for or against a person\u2019s chances in life.\n\n43 years behind schedule: The Social Progress Imperative assessed 149 different countries, across 51 different indicators related to the goals. They say the world will be 43 years behind schedule in reaching the U.N. 2030 targets, and that the U.S. has gone backwards since 2014.\n\nGOING LOCAL: There\u2019s a big push this year for localized implementation of the U.N. global goals. Such as this \u201cMaking Global Goals Local Business\u201d campaign. Meeting the global goals will depend on hundreds of partnerships across the world, such as these new initiatives below.\n\nUsing data to save lives: The Rockefeller Foundation is allocating $100 million for a \u201cPrecision Public Health Initiative.\u201d The goal is to prevent 6 million deaths by 2030 by using large datasets, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning to reduce preventable maternal and child deaths. Partners include UNICEF, WHO, The Global Fund, the Global Financing Facility and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.\n\n$300 million global industry alliance to end plastic waste and clean up oceans: The Minderoo Foundation this afternoon launches \u201cSea the Future,\u201d which aims to make plastics a cashable commodity. That\u2019s code for an already common (but not widespread) idea: paying customers for returning plastic bottles for recycling. Backers include Conservation International, Walmart, Unilever and The Coca Cola Company.\n\nBreathe freely: The Clean Air Fund and the World Economic Forum are partnering to tackle air pollution. More details here.\n\nCatching Our Eye\n\nHELLO (AMBASSADOR) KITTY: Hello Kitty has been rehabilitated. The world-famous \u201canthropomorphic cat girl\u201d from Japan \u2014 last seen receiving a \u20ac6.2 million EU antitrust fine \u2014 is now a U.N. ambassador, promoting sustainable development goals. U.N. officials unveiled a series of videos, featuring Kitty White explaining the value of equal education opportunities, fighting climate change and expanding health coverage. A human-size Hello Kitty, perhaps an imposter, made an appearance at U.N. headquarters Tuesday.\n\nThe Orb is back!\n\nTrolling Trump 1 \u2014 Greta Thunberg: The teenage climate activist changed her Twitter bio to Trump\u2019s taunting description of her: \u201cA very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.\u201d The U.S. president tweeted the remark apparently mocking her alongside a video of Thunberg\u2019s fiery plea for more action from world leaders during Monday\u2019s climate summit.\n\nTrolling Trump 2 \u2014 Venezeulan bookworm: During Trump\u2019s speech, a Venezuelan delegate strategically chose to read up on Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the Venezuelan military and political leader who helped Latin American countries achieve independence from Spain in the early 1800s. On Twitter, she called Trump\u2019s rhetoric \u201cxenophobic and imperialistic.\u201d\n\nQuotable\n\n\u201cIf we can land a man on the moon, surely we can protect a woman in childbirth.\u201d \u2014 Jenni Lee, UN Foundation.\n\n\"Why did he want to buy Greenland then? Because he knows it's going to melt and underneath is all the things he wants to get his greedy little hands on.\u201d \u2014 Former Irish President Mary Robinson, on whether Trump is a climate change denier.\n\n\u201cEverything about Brexit makes me want to slit my wrists.\u201d \u2014 British CEO speaking to Playbook in the wake of Supreme Court ruling against Johnson\u2019s government.\n\nDataPoints of the Day\n\nGLOBAL ENERGY INVESTMENTS REMAIN CARBON-HEAVY: 2018 data shows little indication that the world's current trajectory of energy investment will meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, reports the Internationale Energy Agency.\n\nView the full DataPoint graphic here.

Curtis once joked that he\u2019d had the published version of an interview cut down to 11 seconds. Ensuring interview justice is served, you can listen to Playbook\u2019s full conversation with Curtis in this podcast\n\n\n\nHighlights below.\n\nWhy do you think the U.N. struggles to make itself known? \u201cIf you've negotiated the Sustainable Development Goals for three years and you finally get round to issuing it, it's quite easy for people who've done that not to realize this is the public's first encounter.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution? \u201cMake it as accessible, as appealing, as noisy, as populist as you can. The people who make the posters and trailers of my movies: I hate them. Because they reduce the incredible hard work of my movie to one picture that doesn't even come from the movie. But I know it's necessary.\u201d\n\nDid the climate strikers take your message of simplicity to heart with their concentrated demands? \u201cI'm incredibly inspired by these movements. [And] what's happening this week at UNGA, you know that couldn't really be done by anyone except the U.N \u2026 what I've tried to do is make the relationship between the U.N. and all these outside forces more vibrant.\u201d\n\nEntourage\n\nCLASH OF THE RECEPTIONS: The U.S. and EU missions to the U.N. conducted parallel receptions Tuesday night, raising eyebrows at the American end. According to Playbook\u2019s European sources, the Europeans were completely aware of the scheduling clash (and very happy with their turnout, see here).\n\nThe EU bash morphed into a kind of farewell reception for the bloc\u2019s chief diplomat, Federica Mogherini, who confirmed to the crowd that she would be staying on in Brussels after her term ends November 1. She isn\u2019t easing up between now and then: Mogherini announced the Iran nuclear deal is alive and well to cheers from the crowd, before offering a compliment to Charles Michel (incoming European Council president and outgoing Belgian prime minister), who was present: \u201cThe Council will be in excellent hands. I don\u2019t know about Belgium.\u201d\n\nAlso spotted at the EU reception: Leo Varadkar, Frans Timmermans, Helga Schmid, Gordon Sondland, Christos Stylianides, Werner Hoyer, Jeppe Kofod, Simon Coveney, Udo Bullmann, Maja Kocijan\u010di\u010d, Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, Emma Navarro, Ambroise Fayolle, Shirin Wheeler and Hugo Sobral.\n\nGEN X TIES: European Council President-elect Charles Michel is working to hit the reset button on transatlantic relations that Trump officials say they want. Michel had dinner with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner at their private apartment in Manhattan. Playbook\u2019s insiders say the dinner stretched for hours. Michel, who is 43, is about five years older than Javanka, as the U.S. president\u2019s daughter and son-in-law are known in the tabloids. The strategy: Keep your friends close, and your Trumps closer.\n\nMEDIA MELTDOWN: Did you notice an uptick in negative media stories midday Tuesday? It might be because the internet and the coffee evaporated simultaneously at 11 a.m. in the U.N. HQ media tent.\n\nHOW TO BE A GOOD AMBASSADOR IN THE PLATFORM AGE: Diplomacy used to be about listening, clever language and well-deployed cocktails. In this megaphone and digital age where everyone is a self-appointed savior, it\u2019s more complicated. Playbook spoke to a handful of U.N. ambassadors for their take on how to succeed in 2019.\n\nLeague of their own: \u201cIt\u2019s all about relationships,\u201d said one ambassador from a G7 country. In other words: don\u2019t nerd out on your policy brief when you could be taking tea. In the U.N. system, it\u2019s also important to know what league you are playing in. The top of the U.N. pyramid are the \u201cP5\u201d \u2014 the ambassadors of the permanent Security Council members: U.S., Russia, China, U.K. and France. But the P5 play in what amounts to a \u201cChampions League\u201d and the cast of other teams in that league rotates depending on several factors: how big the country is, the reputation of the country\u2019s leader, whether it\u2019s a temporary Security Council member, and the personal skills of the ambassador.\n\nGermany is a case in point here: Berlin has a very well connected ambassador (Christoph Heusgen) and a respected national leader in Angela Merkel, helping it make up for its lack of P5 status. The European Union is an interesting hybrid: It\u2019s not a U.N. member but it does coordinate weekly meetings of all EU ambassadors, making the U.N. its most tightly organized diplomatic operation outside of Brussels.\n\nUN-TRADITIONAL: One tradition we\u2019d love to skip: the weird photo pose moment before each leader speaks. They sit on a chair that resembles the chairs allocated to Santa characters at shopping malls at Christmas time.\n\nA message from S&P Global: \u201cAlthough they represent a tiny fraction of the overall debt market, green bonds have grown rapidly over the last six years. Issuance totaled $169 billion in 2018 and is expected to rise to $250 billion in 2019. But the market has been dogged by a lack of supply since its inception, with a limited number of projects and increased costs among the reasons why issuance remains low. At the same time, investor appetite is strong...\u201d Read more essential intelligence on climate risk from S&P Global.\n\nSpotted\n\nSPOTTED: Amal Clooney and Nadia Murad chatting at the NY Palace.\n\nGOAL!
