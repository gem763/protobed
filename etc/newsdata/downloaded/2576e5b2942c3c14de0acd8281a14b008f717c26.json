South Park (a show that has joked about subjects ranging from Mohammed to the Virgin Mary to Caitlyn Jenner to the death of Trayvon Martin) was just renewed through a 26th season. At the end of September, It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia will begin its 14th season, even though the last one featured comedic episodes on topics that the Woke Warriors would certainly say you may not joke about, such as the transgender-bathroom debate and Me Too.\n\nThere\u2019s empirical evidence suggesting that the people who support extreme levels of political correctness are the ones who are, as Martin put it in his review of Chappelle\u2019s special, \u201cout of touch with today\u201d \u2014 not the other way around. A study released last year by the international research initiative More in Common, titled \u201cHidden Tribes: A Study of America\u2019s Polarized Landscape,\u201d found that 80 percent of the population believes \u201cpolitical correctness is a problem in our country,\u201d including 61 percent of traditional liberals. Like a beautiful but mean high-school bully after losing the Student Council election, the PC Police have learned they are not as popular as they thought they were.\n\nHow, then, did they get so powerful? It\u2019s simple: Cultural censorship through fear. The social-justice crowd has become the dominant voice on cultural affairs not because their views are actually the most popular, but because they are so good at silencing the others.", "description": "", "authors": ["Katherine Timpf", "Nationalreview.Com Magazine Defiant-Dave-Chappelle"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
