In fact, for the past 20-odd days, the leading cryptocurrency has been stuck in an effectively 8% range \u2014 something that doesn\u2019t happen all too often.\n\nThis likely leaves you wondering \u2014 what comes next for the cryptocurrency market? More sideways price action or a spike?\n\nApparently, it\u2019s the latter.\n\nVolatility Nears\n\nAnalyst CryptoHamster noted that a Bitcoin price breakout \u201cis approaching\u201d, looking to the fact that the one-day Bollinger Bands (a technical indicator meant to determine ranges) have begun to heavily tighten.\n\nIt is getting tighter here \u2013 the breakout is approaching.\n\nAt least, bitcoin is above the Bollinger Bands base line.$BTC $BTCUSD #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/miXhMKwzHf \u2014 CryptoHamster (@CryptoHamsterIO) October 15, 2019\n\nTheir observation comes shortly after prominent analyst Josh Rager wrote the following on Twitter: \u201cWith three weeks of sideways and the bbands starting to pinch, Bitcoin price could see some volatility soon.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as the chart above shows, periods of tight Bollinger Band ranges have preceded large breakouts at least four times this year, implying that this time is going to be no different.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Volume levels on BitMEX, the leading Bitcoin futures platform, have begun to fall to multi-month lows. Low volume in markets after a period of consolidation is often indicative of impending volatility.\n\nBitcoin Price to Mount Higher\n\nWhile the breakout could head in any direction, analysts are leaning bullish on Bitcoin at the moment.\n\nBrave New Coin\u2019s Josh Olszewicz recently noted that the Tenkan and Kijun lines of the Ichimoku Cloud suggest that BTC has a higher chance of reverting to a mean (higher than current price) than establishing a lower low under $7,700. Olszewicz added that Bitcoin is trying to form an inverse head and shoulders/diamond bottoming pattern on its 12-hour chart.\n\nWith this in mind, Olszewicz said that Bitcoin could feasibly rally by 10% from current levels to hit $9,300 in the coming days and weeks.\n\n$BTC TK lines on 12h and 1D suggest mean reversion over lower lows also known as TK disequilibrium or TK c-clamp target = 9.3 based on 12h kumo & 1D kijun pic.twitter.com/7Pe8c5JOe4 \u2014 Josh Olszewicz (@CarpeNoctom) October 15, 2019\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only evidence that BTC\u2019s price may be ready to head higher once again. Analyst CL argued that Bitcoin ball is in the court of the bulls, noting that BTC is trading above its monthly time-weighted average price while funding is widely negative (a bullish sign) and this market has established higher lows.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "If you've followed the price of Bitcoin (BTC) at all over the past few weeks, you know there is a large lack of volatility.
