The longer a player has been in the division then the more chance they've got to impress. We're also not considering anyone who has been in the league fewer than two years.\n\nSuccess is a big factor. So we're talking league titles, PFA Player of the Year awards, Golden Boots, Golden Glove awards etc.\n\nAbsolutely nothing that happened before January 1, 2010 is taken into account. Nothing. Not a thing. As far as we're concerned, these players were all created on 01/01/2010.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nGot all that? Good.\n\nGoing to take it all into consideration before getting angry in the comments section? Of course not.\n\nRight, eyes down. Here we go.\n\n50.

Steven Gerrard\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nClub: Liverpool\n\nYears active: 2010-2015\n\nThe Liverpool icon\u2019s best days were certainly in the 2000s, but he was still a force of nature in this decade and was the Premier League top assist provider in 2013/14, when he made the PFA Team of the Year for a Premier League record eighth time.\n\n29. Romelu Lukaku\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nClubs: Chelsea, West Brom (loan), Everton (initial loan), Manchester United\n\nYears active: 2011-2019\n\nThe Belgian never got much of a chance at Chelsea despite impressive loans at West Brom and Everton, who he eventually moved to permanently.

Wayne Rooney\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nClubs: Manchester United, Everton\n\nYears active: 2010-2018\n\nThe forward\u2019s best years were in the late 2000s, but his 26 goals almost helped Manchester United to the title in 2009/10 and he struck 27 when they narrowly missed out again two years later.

Gareth Bale\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nClubs: Tottenham\n\nYears active: 2010-2013\n\nThe PFA Player of the Year in 2010/11 and 2012/13 - adding the Young Player award in the latter - the Welshman was an unstoppable Premier League force for a while, earning him a move to Real Madrid .\n\n8. James Milner\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nClubs: Aston Villa, Manchester City, Liverpool\n\nYears active: 2010-present\n\nIncredibly, the Yorkshireman was named in the PFA Team of the Year for the 2009/10 season, and he's still going strong 10 years later.
