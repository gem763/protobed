A trial in Richmond, the state capital, began in the spring as the abortion debate exploded nationwide. Several states had passed strict new laws limiting abortions, including Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Ohio and Kentucky.\n\nOn Monday, Hudson struck down two other state laws, including one requiring all second-trimester abortions to be performed at a licensed outpatient hospital. The judge agreed with opponents that the procedure can be safely performed at clinics and doctor\u2019s offices.\n\nHudson also overturned regulations that would have required clinics that provide first-trimester abortions to meet the same facility requirements as general and surgical hospitals.\n\nWomen\u2019s reproductive rights groups that brought the lawsuit expressed disappointment with the mixed ruling.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that our patients did not get their constitutionally-protected right to accessing healthcare without legislative interference, which they are entitled to and they deserve,\u201d said a statement from Rosemary Codding, the founder and director of the Falls Church Healthcare Center.\n\nAmy Hagstrom Miller, president and chief executive officer of Whole Woman\u2019s Health Alliance, said the group is pleased that the court relaxed state restrictions on second-trimester abortion care, but disappointed that the judge \u201cdid not see clearly how the other restrictions it left in force are not supported by medical evidence and place undue burdens on families on the Commonwealth.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs at trial opted to have a judge decide the case instead of a jury.\n\nDuring the trial, a lawyer for the women\u2019s health groups argued that the regulations are overly restrictive and put up \u201cunnecessary barriers\u201d to women seeking abortions.\n\nA doctor testified that abortion \u201cis one of the safest medical procedures that exist.\u201d\n\nDr. Mark Nichols, an obstetrician/gynecologist who worked for years as the medical director of a Planned Parenthood chapter in Oregon, testified that the laws being challenged in Virginia add layers of regulation that are not medically necessary.\n\nThe state argued that the laws have made abortion clinics safer and have not placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions.\n\n\u201cInconvenience is not an unconstitutional burden,\u201d said Emily Munro Scott, an attorney representing the state.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A federal judge on Monday upheld a Virginia law requiring women to undergo an ultrasound and wait at least 24 hours before having an abortion and the state's \"physician-only law\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Denise Lavoie"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/02/07/virginia_politics_blackface_00257_c0-203-4672-2927_s1770x1032.jpg?4f543904762bdf874f815f90a9c8db727f691844", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
