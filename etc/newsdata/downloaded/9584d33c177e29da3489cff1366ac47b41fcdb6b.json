It\u2019s been up and down every since: up when the U.S. and China appeared closer to a trade deal and down when talks fizzled.\n\nRead: Consumer sentiment shows Americans still fairly optimistic despite slowing economy\n\nNow the two countries are talking again.\n\nWhat happened: American feel pretty good about the economy right now, but they\u2019re not quite as confident about the future.\n\nThe so-called present situation index rose to 172.3 from 170.6.\n\n\u201cConfidence levels remain high and there are no indications that consumers will curtail their holiday spending,\u201d said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the privately run Conference Board.\n\nYet an index that looks at expectations six months from now declined to 94.9 from 96.8. Consumers expressed somewhat less optimism about the labor market in light of the recent slowdown in hiring.\n\nThe consumer confidence survey measures how Americans view their own financial well-being, job prospects and overall business conditions.\n\nBig picture: A confident consumer means a sound economy, simple as that. Consumer spending accounts for almost 70% of U.S. economic activity.\n\nAlthough spending slowed down sharply in third quarter, Americans are still spending enough to keep the economy out of recession. Falling interest rates are also doing their part by making homes, autos and other big-ticket items cheaper to purchase.\n\nTo keep the economy from backsliding, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to cut interest rates again. The U.S. and China have also worked to tamp down trade tensions to reduce the angst that\u2019s caused business spending and investment to retrench.\n\nSo far the potential impeachment of President Trump has made little dent in consumer confidence.\n\nRead: \u2018We are all screwed!\u2019 The U.S. is like a banana republic, warns money manager\n\nWhat they are saying?: \u201cGiven the economy now rests firmly on the shoulders of consumer spending, this is good news,\u201d said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. Any slight changes in business or job outlooks should not affect consumer behavior to a degree that it will affect the economy.\u201d\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.22% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.25% increased modestly in Tuesday trades. The S&P set an all-time high the day before.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.24% was unchanged at 1.84%.", "description": "Americans remained pretty confident in the economy in October as trade tensions with China died down and stocks rebounded to record highs.
