In one message, a senior US diplomat in Ukraine, William Taylor, told US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nIn a potential blow to Trump, Sondland \u2013 previously considered a loyalist \u2013 is reportedly preparing to testify that Trump possibly did consider the Biden investigation and delivery of the aid to be a quid pro quo.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the ambassador will tell Congress this week that he worked to persuade Ukraine to announce an inquiry into an energy company where Hunter Biden worked, and dangled a meeting at the White House for Zelenskiy as an incentive.\n\nSondland reportedly intends to claim he did not realise the company was linked to the Bidens.\n\n\u201cIt was a quid pro quo, but not a corrupt one,\u201d the Post reported a person familiar with Sondland\u2019s testimony had said in summarising Sondland\u2019s position.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the European Union, seen in Bucharest.
