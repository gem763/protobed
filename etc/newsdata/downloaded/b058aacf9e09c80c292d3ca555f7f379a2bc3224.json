The fight will also be broadcast on DAZN, the home of marquee fighters like the middleweight champion Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez and former heavyweight ruler Anthony Joshua.\n\nAs it is now a legitimate fight, it has caught the attention of the fight game's reporters \u2014 and they are not happy.\n\n\"I had no trouble pushing Paul v KSI when it was a prank, mad, fun fight \u2026 I loved that it did great numbers,\" the talkSPORT, Independent, and BT Sport boxing expert Steve \"Big Daddy\" Bunce said on Twitter.\n\n\"It's trickier now that they are in my business \u2014 a business of honorable and hardened professional boxers. There should be no shortcuts. Not for boxers, promoters, or managers.\"\n\nHe later said both YouTubers \"would lose to 16-year-old amateur boxers.\"\n\nThe Sky Sports reporter Ed Draper replied to Bunce to say that the event feeds into the \"attention economy\" but added that he respects them regardless.\n\nESPN journalist Steve Kim channeled the former long-time commentator for HBO Sports, saying boxing cannot be killed nor saved.\n\n\"When I was asked to be involved in the rematch it got me excited but I had some requests to help integrate the two audiences,\" Hearn said in a press release seen by Business Insider.\n\n\"I requested that both fighters turn professional and undergo the same medicals that any other fighter would. I asked that the fighters lose the headguards and use 10-ounce gloves, if we are going to do this then let's do it properly.\n\n\"Both men obliged and now they prepare for war on November 9. This event will be huge, a world championship card beneath an event that will create a hype for boxing not seen in the US for a long time.\n\n\"Staples Center will be sold out and a new audience will join our great sport and tune in live on DAZN.\"", "description": "The YouTubers would \"lose to 16-year-old amateur boxers,\" one renowned fight reporter said.
