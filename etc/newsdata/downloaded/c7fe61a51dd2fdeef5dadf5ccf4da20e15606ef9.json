(Shannon VanRaes/Reuters)\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was elected to a second term Monday evening, garnering a surprisingly strong showing despite several recent scandals that damaged his reputation as a champion of the social-justice-oriented left.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Liberal party also bested their conservative counterparts in the legislature but fell short of preserving their parliamentary majority. As of early Tuesday morning, Liberals controlled 156 seats in the 338-seat House of Commons, leaving them 14 seats short of a majority. Conservatives won the popular vote, however, with 35 percent compared with Liberals\u2019 33 percent.\n\n\u201cTonight Canadians rejected division and negativity. They rejected cuts and austerity. They elected a progressive agenda and strong action on climate change,\u201d Trudeau said in remarks to supporters Tuesday morning. \u201cTo those who did not vote for us, know that we will work every single day for you. We will govern for everyone.\u201d\n\nTrudeau managed to overcome several controversies, including several photos unearthed last month of him dressed in blackface and brownface. He also took heat when his former attorney general claimed he had pressured her to stop the prosecution of Quebec construction company SNC-Lavalin.\n\nCritics accused Trudeau\u2019s Conservative opponent, Andrew Scheer, of squandering his chance to win as the prime minister battled multiple scandals by running an acerbic campaign against Trudeau, at one point accusing him of not being able to remember how many times he had dressed in blackface.\n\n\u201cTonight Conservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cAnd Mr. Trudeau when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready and we will win.\u201d\n\nFormer U.S. president Barack Obama endorsed Trudeau during the last week of his campaign.\n\n\u201cThe world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term,\u201d Obama said.", "description": "\u201cTonight Canadians rejected division and negativity,\u201d Trudeau said.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
