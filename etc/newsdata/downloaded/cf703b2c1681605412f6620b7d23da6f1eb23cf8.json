'He can't start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations.'\n\nTrump was likely referring to House ethics rules, which ban former members of Congress from communication or appearing before any lawmakers or congressional staffers 'with the intent to influence' for one year after leaving office.\n\nTrey Gowdy will not be joining team defending President Trump on impeachment\n\nTrey Gowdy wouldn't be able to start until January and impeachment inquiry has heated up\n\nSince Gowdy retired from Congress in January 2019, he would not be able to try and influence his former colleagues until January 2020.\n\nBut on Sunday The New York Times reported Gowdy wasn't coming on board after all and the blame was being pointed at acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nMulvaney had wanted Gowdy because he was a former prosecutor who understood how Congress worked but not everyone in the White House was in agreement.\n\nWhite House Counsel Pat Cipollone wasn't convinced about Mulvaney's former colleague in Congress, the Times reported, as Cipollone and Mulvaney have clashed on the best way to respond to the Democrats' impeachment probe.\n\nTrump also had lunch with Gowdy last week as he was skeptical about adding him to the team.\n\nGowdy, who became a national name for his investigation of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the Benghazi matter, had challenged the president in the past including on his unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that the FBI had spied on his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAdditionally, Trump has seemed opposed to setting up the kind of war room that Bill Clinton aides established in the 1990s to fight his impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe president sees himself as his own best communicator and takes to Twitter to fight his own battles.\n\nBut after Trump met with Gowdy it seemed as all systems were go.\n\nTrump attorney Jay Sekulow released a statement welcoming Gowdy to the team and the president told reporters Gowdy would be on board in January.\n\nBut it was that start date that started to unravel the agreement.\n\nGowdy flagged a concern from his law firm about the House rule that put a one-year cap on his activities.\n\nTo play it safe, Gowdy told the White House he wouldn't be able to start until January 4.\n\nBut the president needed someone who could go on television and start defending him immediately, Fox News reported, as Democrats' stepped their investigation and subpoenas were coming at the administration.\n\nSubpoenas or document requests have gone out to the White House, the Defense Department, the White House Office of Management and Budget, Vice President Mike Pence, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and two Giuliani associates.\n\nThe deadlines for most of those requests are this coming week.\n\nA report has White House Counsel Pat Cipollone (left) and acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney (right) fighting over the impeachment defense strategy\n\nTrump son-in-law and White House counselor Jared Kushner is reported involved\n\nFiona Hill, a former top National Security Council expert on Russia, arrived on Capitol Hill Monday to testify before lawmakers conducting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHill is expected to testify how the Trump administration's relationship with the Ukraine was affected by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and the push for a probe into Joe Biden.\n\nGiuliani has been one of the biggest promoters of an unproven theory that Biden, as vice president, pushed the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor to benefit a gas company where his son sat on the board.\n\nGordon Sondland, Trump's ambassador to the European Union, who was a part of the conversations about the role of the Ukraine, will testify on Thursday.\n\nSonland was scheduled to testify last week but Trump blocked him from doing so. He was appearing voluntarily but, after the president told him not to show up, Democrats issued a subpoena.\n\nFormer Ambassador the Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified last week as did Kurt Volker, a former envoy to Ukraine.\n\nBut now with Gowdy out and Giuliani being sidelined as he gets pulled into the impeachment inquiry for his actions involving the Ukraine, there are questions about who will be the public face of the president's defense.\n\nTrump had the same question, according to the Times, and asked if of Mulvaney, who told him it his son-in-law, White House Counselor Jared Kushner.\n\nKushner has been working on the impeachment inquiry but it's unclear as to what his exact role is.", "description": "Donald Trump's attempt to bring Trey Gowdy on board to lead his impeachment defense appears to be dead in the water after being stymied by lobbying regulations and intra-staff bickering.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/20/19706632-0-image-a-25_1571079797574.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
