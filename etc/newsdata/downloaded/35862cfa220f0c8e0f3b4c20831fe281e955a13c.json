We cannot allow our prisons to become factories for crime. That\u2019s why we\u2019re spending up to \u00a32.5bn to create modern, efficient prisons which reform and rehabilitate offenders, and have invested an extra \u00a3100m in airport-style scanners to make our prisons safer.\n\n\u201cWe have recruited over 4,700 new prison officers in two years and have given additional mental health training to over 24,000 staff overall.\u201d", "description": "Many prisoners are \u201cunwell not evil\u201d and should be in secure hospitals\u00a0rather than behind bars, the chief inspector of constabulary has said as Boris Johnson announces a raft of measures to imprison more people and for longer periods of time.", "authors": ["May Bulman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/10/09/prison.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
