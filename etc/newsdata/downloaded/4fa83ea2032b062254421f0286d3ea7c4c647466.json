Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump, who had directed secret efforts to obtain stolen Hillary Clinton emails, made a public televised request to Russia. That night, Russia made an attempt to hack into her email. Nevertheless, Republicans consistently dismissed Trump\u2019s message as a joke.\n\nIn 2019, backed by a monthslong diplomatic pressure campaign, President Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Joe Biden in a phone call, and has repeatedly affirmed his right to do so. Yesterday, he stood on the White House lawn and asked Ukraine and China to investigate Joe Biden, and followed that up with a tweet reaffirming his \u201cabsolute right\u201d to ask any country to investigate anybody he deems corrupt.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio was asked about the new request to China. Rubio suggested it was probably just a joke and not \u201ca real request\u201d \u2014 \u201cjust him needling the press.\u201d\n\nAs with Russia, China did not see Trump\u2019s request as a joke. \u201cOne Trump ally outside the White House described receiving a message from Chinese government officials asking if Trump was serious when he suggested China open an investigation into Biden,\u201d CNN reports, \u201cThe response: Investigating corruption is an easy way to earn goodwill with Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s economic adviser, Lawrence Kudlow, meanwhile, when asked by an interviewer if he could assure the audience that Trump\u2019s demands for a Biden probe would not be part of his negotiations with China, replied, \u201cI can\u2019t assure you of anything.\u201d\n\nTrump has made his position completely plain: Any country that can produce dirt on his domestic enemies, plausible or otherwise, will be diplomatically rewarded. That offer not only includes but is especially targeted to countries with the most brutal and corrupt systems of justice. (It\u2019s not like Canada can easily gin up a fake investigation because the president wants one.) Republicans of principle will object to this flagrant abuse of power, but nobody considers \u201cRepublicans of principle\u201d to be a category that includes Marco Rubio.", "description": "President Trump asked Ukraine and China to investigate Joe Biden, and followed that up with a tweet reaffirming his \u201cabsolute right\u201d to ask any country to investigate anybody Trump deems corrupt.
