All are welcome. Details here.\n\n1. In Christianity Today: Syrian Christians to US: \u2018Don\u2019t Abandon Us Now\u2019\n\n2.\n\nIn the Book of Acts, one of the early priorities of the resurrected Jesus was to hear the cries of a persecuted people in Syria. He still does. Many of our brothers and sisters in Christ among those targeted for slaughter, right now. \u2014 Russell Moore (@drmoore) October 9, 2019\n\n3.\n\nWe won\u2019t let those fleeing terror and tyranny into the US and now we abandon them overseas. It\u2019s sad for a country who has long been a beacon of freedom and a refuge for those who are fleeing religious persecution. \u2014 Daniel Darling (@dandarling) October 9, 2019\n\n4. Wow\n\n\"But there were those [in Auschwitz] who said we should fast, precisely because it was dangerous to do so. We need to show God that we\u2019re here, locked in hell, but we were capable of singing his praises.\u201d https://t.co/lskCLuFWDc #YomKippur \u2014 The Philos Project (@philosproject) October 9, 2019\n\n5. Rabbi Jonathan Sacks: \u201cGod lifts us when we fall and God forgives us when we fail.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Cardinal Timothy Dolan: What Christians Can Learn from Jews about Atonement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. A friend close to Leland Keyser tells me she has really been suffering in the time since she came forward during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. That was \u2013 and has continued to be \u2013 such a dark time. There\u2019s a \u201cGoFundMe\u201d fundraiser for her here. If you supported Kavanaugh and are grateful he\u2019s on the Supreme Court, considering saying \u201cthank you\u201d in whatever way you can to a Democrat who didn\u2019t have to come forward and who has suffered tremendously, since it seems like the decent thing to do. Again, details here.\n\n8. Adoption pain and advice in Slate\n\n9. A real, hopeful conversation about open adoption between a birth mother and the adoptive mother of her baby:\n\nConversations on Open Adoption \u2013 Part 2 from BraveLove on Vimeo.\n\n10. George Weigel on the Church in Germany\n\n11. Dan Darling: Three spiritual benefits of singing in church\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. Artificial wombs within five years?\n\n13.\n\nI\u2019m pro-choice but find Feminists for Life to be incredibly thought-provoking in their arguments. \u2014 Dr Naomi Wolf (@naomirwolf) October 9, 2019\n\n14. Advice to writers on interviews (and for life, too):\n\n\u201cYou should always try to establish an understanding, a sympathy even, with everyone you interview, even the villains; they\u2019re not totally evil, only human, and what you want to discover if you can is why they behaved the way they did.\u201d pic.twitter.com/HTjY8Y6dvV \u2014 Ray E.
