A screenshot of the now-deleted page that was taken by another user reveals that the 46-year-old Greeley listed her job as 'Business, Computer and Information Technology Teacher at Upper Darb...'\n\nGreeley described herself thus: 'I'm an adventure chaser! I love sports, motorcycles, motorcorss, the beach and outdoor activities!'\n\nThe Upper Darby School District acted swiftly and placed the teacher depicted in the video on administrative leave, saying in a lengthy statement that the district 'does not condone or tolerate inappropriate conduct or speech associated with hate, racism, discrimination or intolerance of any kind.'\n\nNoel's video, which clocks in at 1 minute, 39 seconds, opens with a shot of the teacher examining the damage to the back of her pickup truck while ranting at the father, 'you're probably on welfare, too.'\n\nThe white teacher repeatedly speculated that Noel lives on welfare because he's black\n\nThe educator also claimed that African-Americans 'milk the system,' and then called Noel the N-word\n\nNoel assures her that earns six figures a year - a statement the woman dismisses as 'bulls***.'\n\n'Just because I'm young and I'm black is the reason you would say that,' Noel tells her.\n\nThe teacher confirms his suspicion, saying 'that's right, because you're black.' She then goes on ranting about African-Americans 'always looking to milk the system, and you see me, a white woman, and you think I got money.'\n\nThe two continue arguing about their respective socio-economic conditions, with the teacher doubling down on her previous remarks and telling Noel, 'go back to your welfare and your Section 8 house,' referring to subsidized housing for low-income families.\n\nNoel laughs off the remarks and tells the teacher pacing around her pickup truck that he understands that she is 'mad and nervous.'\n\nThe teacher took an aggressive stance and told Noel to 'bring it on' after he warned her the 'situation could change real quick'\n\nThe teacher brags that she could pay cash to repair the damage to her vehicle, then tells Noel, 'ah, you go f*** off, n*****.'\n\nThe man appears to be taken aback by the racial slurs and says, 'excuse me?'\n\nThe teacher shoots back, 'You heard me.'\n\nNoel then warns the educator that 'this situation could change real quick' and tells her to stay where she is.\n\nThe pugnacious teacher does not back down, telling Noel in an aggressive tone while taking a few steps in his direction, 'Oh yeah, what are you gonna do about it? Bring it on!' At that moment, the video cuts off.\n\nUpper Darby Superintendent Dan McGarry sent out a statement Thursday evening confirming the incident depicted in Rasheed Noel's video and announcing the teacher's suspension pending the outcome of an internal investigation.\n\nDailyMail.com contacted the district spokesperson asking to shed light on Greeley's work history and inquire whether she will be returning to class.\n\nAaronda Beauford, Director of Communications for the Upper Darby School District, revealed in an email that Greeley was hired in 2008.\n\n'The protocol for staff on administrative leave is that they are afforded due process and an informal hearing with administration which took place on October 10th,' the spokesperson wrote. 'The process depends on whether the staff member elects to go before the school Board for a formal hearing or to arbitration.'\n\nNoel later took to his Facebook page, commending district administrators for their quick action.\n\n'They are doing everything in their power to make sure people like this teacher become non existent in any school,' he wrote. 'After meeting with the superintendent of Upper Darby school district and his staff, I'm hear [sic] to say they absolutely care about their community.'\n\nDailyMail.com on Friday morning reached out to Noel seeking comment on the incident.", "description": "A teacher at Drexel Hill Middle School in Pennsylvania was suspended on Thursday after being caught on video hurling the N-word at black parent Rasheed Noel in the parking lot.", "authors": ["Snejana Farberov For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/14/19588708-0-image-a-4_1570800106440.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
