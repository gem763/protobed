That's the way I see it.\"\n\nAsked about bringing in leading figures from other sports, a list that includes soccer stars Roy Keane and Craig Bellamy, former All Blacks coach Mitchell said: \"It's actually a really good way of growing our players so that they are asking the right questions and also creates an informality where everyone can learn.\n\n\"A lot of players in this squad enjoy rugby league,\" explained Mitchell, with England captain Owen Farrell the son of former dual code international Andy Farrell, while fly-half George Ford's father Mike also played league.\n\n\"One of the great things I believe Eddie does in our environment is very much a learning environment.\n\n\"They (the Raiders) have just recently played in one of the major rugby league competitions in the world (NRL grand final), you'd be stupid if you weren't able to gain something from that.\"", "description": "John Mitchell insists there's nothing sinister about welcoming Australian rugby league great Ricky Stuart into the England camp ahead of their World Cup clash against the Wallabies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2221/ca1e9689c5274427973dcf1998d00582.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
