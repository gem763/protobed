Mr. Bloom defended education as a process of intense personal engagement with great works, envisioned as a way to \u201cenlarge a solitary existence.\u201d He viewed the traditional Western canon as the time-tested subject of that engagement and even produced a list to clarify which literary works he considered part of it.\n\nMs. Morrison viewed literary canons as the contingent products of history and associated forms of domination and erasure, not as the timeless embodiments of universal human experiences or values. She championed writing, scholarship and teaching as a process of reclaiming that historical complexity. Her priorities, which were shared by a generation of scholars pursuing race-, gender- and cultural studies-based approaches in the humanities, led toward a diversification of the canon.\n\nThe \u201cculture wars\u201d of the next few decades owed much to these two positions. Both camps became preoccupied with what texts were being assigned in classrooms. The college syllabus became a contested document, suddenly capable of holding Western civilization to its ideals or hastening its decline.", "description": "It wasn\u2019t Bloom.
