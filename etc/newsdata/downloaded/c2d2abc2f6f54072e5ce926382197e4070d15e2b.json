He noted he\u2019d spoken to Pompeo about the idea, however.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s fantastic. But I actually spoke to Mike Pompeo about that. He decided \u2014 I get along with him so well,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have a lot of the same views and a couple of a little different views. But he likes the idea of having somebody in there with him, and I do, too.\u201d\n\nTrump also said he has 15 candidates in mind to replace John Bolton, whom he ousted earlier this week after numerous disagreements about foreign affairs. POLITICO had reported on Wednesday that a wide range of people were being floated for National Security Council chief, from ambassadors to military officers to business leaders.\n\nTrump also proclaimed that he\u2019d had plenty of interest in the post, despite his administration\u2019s reputation for record turnover.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants it badly, as you can imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people want the job \u2014 it\u2019s a great job. It\u2019s great because it\u2019s a lot of fun to work with Donald Trump. It\u2019s very easy actually to work with me. You know why it\u2019s easy? Because I make all the decisions. They don\u2019t have to work.\u201d\n\nThe prevailing assumption is that Trump will pick an NSC head who keeps a lower profile and makes a greater effort to maintain good relations with the rest of Trump\u2019s national security team.\n\nIn announcing Bolton\u2019s departure from the administration earlier this week, Trump said he would name Bolton\u2019s replacement next week, a timeline he reiterated Thursday. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have an answer for you,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cwe\u2019ll probably next week sometime make that decision.\u201d", "description": "Trump also said he has 15 candidates in mind to replace John Bolton.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7b/1d/20cfcf8b4b39b04be11a214439dc/19912-pompeo-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
