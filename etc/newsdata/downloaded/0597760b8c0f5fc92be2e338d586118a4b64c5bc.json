Her activities occurred during the same period as the contacts investigated by Mr Mueller.\n\nRUSSIAN OFFICIAL\n\nThe Russian official with whom Butina conspired was later identified as Alexander Torshin, a deputy governor of Russia's central bank. He was never charged in the case, but was hit with sanctions by the US Treasury Department.\n\nOne of the two Americans referenced in her case was conservative political activist Paul Erickson, her boyfriend. Mr Erickson was not charged for his links to Butina, but was indicted on unrelated wire fraud and money laundering charges in South Dakota. The case against Mr Erickson is still pending.\n\nIn addition, Overstock.com chief executive officer Patrick Byrne resigned in August after confirming a report by Fox News contributor Sara Carter that he also had an intimate relationship with Butina.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said Butina did not engage in \"traditional\" spy craft, but worked behind the scenes to make inroads in conservative political circles and promote friendlier US-Russian relations. She arranged dinners in Washington and New York and attended events to meet prominent politicians.\n\nButina in 2015 appeared at a Trump campaign event and asked him a question about whether he wanted better relations with Russia. Mr Trump responded by telling Butina that he would \"get along very nicely with Putin\".\n\nRussia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs last year accused the United States of forcing Butina to make a false confession to \"absolutely ridiculous charges\" of being a Russian agent.\n\n\"It's not clear what she was convicted of or what crime she committed,\" Mr Putin said in April. \"I think it's a prime example of 'saving face'. They arrested her and put the girl in jail. But there was nothing on her, so in order not to look totally stupid they gave her, fixed her up, with an 18-month sentence to show that she was guilty of something.\"\n\nAsked whether Washington now expects Russia to release a former US Marine named Paul Whelan currently being held on accusations of espionage, a State Department spokesperson said, \"We continue to urge the Russian government to ensure a fair trial, including a fair and public hearing without undue delay, in accordance with its international legal obligations.\"\n\nA Russian court on Thursday ordered Mr Whelan, detained in 2018, held in custody until Dec 29.\n\nMr Whelan, who holds American, British, Canadian and Irish passports, has denied the espionage allegations.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] Convicted Russian agent Maria Butina was released from a Florida prison on Friday after serving most of her 18-month sentence for conspiring to influence US conservative activists and infiltrate a powerful gun rights group, and taken into custody by immigration officials to be deported to her native country. .
