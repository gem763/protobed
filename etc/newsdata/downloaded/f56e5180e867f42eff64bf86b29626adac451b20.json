It\u2019s a bit surreal we are all coming through together and doing it. We are all working hard and, hopefully, we can keep doing well for many years to come.\u201d\n\nWhile Mount and Tomori were already familiar to those who follow Chelsea\u2019s youngsters, it was Derby\u2019s Carabao Cup run last season that alerted a wider audience to their talent.\n\nThey were part of the Rams team that secured a famous penalty shootout victory at Old Trafford over Manchester United, who Chelsea face in the same competition on Wednesday night, and were then given special dispensation to play against their parent club.\n\nOn the victory against United, Mount said: \u201cThat was probably one of a couple of games, Leeds away as well, that really sticks out. To go up there and win, and we could have won in normal time, they equalised really late. We played so well and that\u2019s one of my best memories of being at Derby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe went into the game and we weren\u2019t really nervous,\u201d said Tomori. \u201cWe just went out there with the mentality to play and there weren\u2019t really any nerves. We went to attack the game and it paid off.\u201d\n\nDerby were rewarded with a fourth-round trip to Chelsea and Tomori and Mount were surprisingly allowed to make their first senior appearances at Stamford Bridge for the opposition.\n\n\u201cIt was mixed emotions because we\u2019d come through the Chelsea academy and never played for them and then we were playing against them at Stamford Bridge. It was a weird feeling,\u201d said Mount.\n\nTomori added: \u201cI was very surprised. I was at Hull the year before with Michael Hector and Ola Aina when we got Chelsea in the FA Cup. I was like \u2018imagine if we could play\u2019 and the manager just said \u2018nah\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo when we got Chelsea with Derby, I told Mason \u2018listen, it\u2019s not happening\u2019. We had a day off and the manager (Lampard) came back and said \u2018I\u2019ve been pulling strings for you and you\u2019re allowed to play against Chelsea\u2019. I was more surprised than Mason because in my head it wasn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d", "description": "Mason Mount allowed his point to trail off before Fikayo Tomori picked up the cue to complete the midfielder\u2019s sentence for him.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000214416364-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
