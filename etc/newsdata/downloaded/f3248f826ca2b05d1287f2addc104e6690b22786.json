The district-owned facility has been without running water since Sept. 26 when the bacteria that can cause Legionnaires\u2019 disease were found in its water system.\n\nStaff and patients are relying on bottled water and running water substitutes, such as body wash spray. An attorney for patient advocacy group Disability Rights DC says the lack of potable water has been difficult. Andrea Procaccino told The Washington Post last week that some patients hadn\u2019t been able to shower for days.\n\nDespite the lack of potable water, the hospital has continued to admit patients.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: WTOP-FM, http://www.wtop.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A public psychiatric hospital in the nation's capital may soon have running water again.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
