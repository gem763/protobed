Lost may have lost millions of viewers over the years, but what it secured was a cult fan-base that hadn't been seen since The X-Files, and has rarely been seen since. Its many mysteries, ensemble of intriguing characters and jaw-dropping twist endings kept its core viewers on the edge of their seats right through to its finale in May 2010.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nTo celebrate the show's 15th anniversary, we've done seemingly unthinkable and ranked every single episode.\n\nNB: The finales that were first broadcast on the same evening have been counted as one episode.\n\n113. Homecoming \u2013 Season one, episode 15\n\nEven co-creator Damon Lindelof dislikes this episode. It\u2019s the one that does Charlie dirty by somehow making him even more annoying than Ethan, a villain who\u2019s trying to abduct a pregnant woman.\n\n112. Stranger In a Strange Land \u2013 Season three, episode nine\n\nInfamously bad. Jack\u2019s tattoos get explained in the show\u2019s most pointless flashbacks. Even the island stuff (Isabel the sheriff) is thrown by the wayside the moment it ends. The whole thing feels like it was written by someone who has never seen a Lost episode.\n\n111. Fire + Water \u2013 Season two, episode 12\n\nCharlie at his whiniest. It\u2019s Lost at a low ebb and features several moments that feel supremely out of character (see: Locke attacking Charlie).\n\n110. Special \u2013 Season one, episode 14\n\nFor an episode that sparks a storyline designed to run through the remainder of the season (the raft launch), \u201cSpecial\u201d is anything but, and feels disappointingly throwaway.\n\n109. What Kate Does \u2013 Season six, episode three\n\n\u201cWhat Kate Does\u201d fails to convince the viewer the flashsideways scenes are going to be worth their time. The island events feel thinly drawn, but thankfully, it\u2019s the worst the unfairly-maligned final season gets.\n\n108. Recon \u2013 Season six, episode eight\n\nBy far the weakest Sawyer episode, even if his flashsideways scenes are among some of the final season\u2019s best. It\u2019s everything else that lacks here, even though demented Claire trying to kill Kate as \u201czombie\u201d Sayid watches on is an offbeat delight.\n\n107. The Other Woman \u2013 Season four, episode six\n\nOne of Lost\u2019s most formulaic episodes that tries to earn our trust of Daniel and Charlotte even though we could clearly trust them all along. It\u2019s easily the weakest instalment of season four.\n\n106. Further Instructions \u2013 Season three, episode three\n\nDespite this episode\u2019s ambition (that airport vision Locke has is a beautiful misfire), it feels like the writers are struggling to find their feet between the season two finale and the brilliant stuff to come later on in season three. Earns points for Desmond wearing Hurley\u2019s oversized tie dye T-shirt.\n\n105. The Greater Good \u2013 Season one, episode 21\n\nWhat goes up must come down and, despite some interesting Sayid flashbacks, \u201cThe Greater Good\u201d falls victim to being the episode that comes off a run of five belters.\n\n104. Meet Kevin Johnson \u2013 Season four, episode eight\n\nLost was never on its best form when the majority of a certain episode was dedicated to a flashback. This particular outing, which fills the viewer in on Michael\u2019s whereabouts since he sailed off with Walt, fits in too much and tacks on Danielle Rousseau\u2019s death. Sure, time was limited, but the long-standing French woman deserved a better send-off.\n\n103. Hearts and Minds \u2013 Season one, episode 12\n\nNot a terrible episode; just one of the very few season one adventures that feel like we\u2019re treading water until we get to the good stuff.\n\n102. Born to Run \u2013 Season one, episode 22\n\nHas the tough task of putting the pieces in place for the impeccable season one finale, and doesn\u2019t pull it off too well. Purely exists to make up the numbers.\n\n101. The Glass Ballerina \u2013 Season two, episode two\n\nWe didn\u2019t really need an episode focused on what happened to Sayid, Sun and Jin after they sailed off in search for The Others\u2019s camp at the end of season two, but it does pave the way for a crucial moment in Sun\u2019s story when she becomes a killer (of a character played by Deadwood\u2019s Paula Malcolmson, no less).\n\n100. What Kate Did \u2013 Season two, episode nine\n\nThe one where Kate sees a horse in the jungle. Sporadically poor \u2013 Kate thinking the spirit of her father has possessed Sawyer is a dud idea \u2013 but is saved by some magnificent Locke and Eko scenes, and one of the best cliffhangers of the season.\n\n99. The Package \u2013 Season six, episode 10\n\nDoes well thrusting importance back onto Sun and Jin, despite having lots to wrap up before the series finale. Stands out for a touching late-stage scene involving Yunjin Kim and Matthew Fox that hits home just how far these characters have come. Everything else \u2013 mainly the scenes involving the pointless Zoe (Sheila Kelley) \u2013 falls by the wayside.\n\n98. Whatever the Case May Be \u2013 Season one, episode 12\n\nYour view on this episode depends on how you feel about Kate\u2019s toy plane; I don\u2019t mind it. The cat-and-mouse aspect between her and Sawyer is fun, but there\u2019s no denying it\u2019s pure filler and frustrating due to the fact it comes after a mega cliffhanger.\n\n97. Adrift \u2013 Season two, episode two\n\nThe fallout of Walt\u2019s dramatic kidnapping at the end of season one decreases in quality with each watch despite some killer Sawyer lines (\u201cWhat ya gonna do? Splash me?\u201d) and a world-expanding ending.\n\n96. Something Nice Back Home \u2013 Season four, episode 10\n\nIncludes some melodramatic Jack and Kate moments within their flashforwards, and the former demanding he conduct his own appendectomy on the island is so hilariously Jack, it doesn\u2019t even irk. A pretty ridiculous episode, actually.\n\n95. The Cost of Living \u2013 Season three, episode five\n\nAdewale Akkinuoye-Agbaje dealt the writers a curveball when he asked to be written out of the show, so Mr Eko\u2019s rushed conclusion isn\u2019t really their fault. Still, the climactic showdown between Eko and Smokey is a gutpunch, boosted by the preceding interplay between Agbaje and Adetokumboh M\u2019Cormack, who plays his brother, Yemi. Also: first appearance of Mikhail.\n\n94. The Moth \u2013 Season one, episode seven\n\nThere are some fantastic Locke and Charlie scenes hidden among an episode that\u2019s pretty average by Lost\u2019s standards. The one where Sayid gets thwacked around the head by Locke is fun and mysterious, though (we only discover it was him 14 episodes later).\n\n93. Abandoned \u2013 Season two, episode six\n\nOnce you get past Sayid and Shannon getting it on, there\u2019s some good stuff here \u2013 namely the latter\u2019s surprisingly emotional death. Maggie Grace\u2019s only flashback episode is nowhere near as weak as some fans remember.\n\n92. Lighthouse \u2013 Season six, episode six\n\nJack\u2019s haters are given reason to dislike the \u201cbroken\u201d spinal surgeon all over again thanks to this frustrating episode, which sees him battle with the discovery that he\u2019s been led to the island his entire life. Earns a big point for bringing back Shannon\u2019s missing inhaler for no reason but nostalgia.\n\n91. Some Like It Hoth \u2013 Season five, episode 13\n\nThere\u2019s lots to like here \u2013 the numbers being embossed on the Swan station door! \u2013 but with a finite number of episodes to go until the conclusion of the series, it\u2019s all just very filler. Still, Miles is a great character, and it\u2019s terrific to see Ken Leung getting his time to shine.\n\n90. Everybody Loves Hugo \u2013 Season six, episode 12\n\nPuts the brakes on the final season slightly, which is slightly disconcerting considering the end is near, but there\u2019s lots of enjoyable moments courtesy of temperamental dynamite and the Hurley-Libby flashsideways reunion. Also features the slightly clunky whispers reveal.\n\n89. Left Behind \u2013 Season three, episode 15\n\nThis episode has all the components of a terrific one, but it falls short of the mark. The Kate and Cassidy \u201csisters doing it for themselves\u201d flashbacks are well-meaning if ultimately dry, and the plot of Juliet and Kate being handcuffed in the jungle isn\u2019t as entertaining as it should be until Smokey shows up. The calm before the storm that was the final eight episodes of season three.\n\n88. Ji Yeon \u2013 Season four, episode seven\n\nThe clues may have been there all along, but the revelation that we\u2019re watching Jin\u2019s flashbacks alongside Sun\u2019s flashforwards is Lost at its most tricksy. The island stuff is rather entertaining as Juliet drops the infidelity bombshell to keep Sun from heading to Locke\u2019s camp.\n\n87. Across the Sea \u2013 Season six, episode 15\n\nIt\u2019s not that \u201cAcross the Sea\u201d is a weak episode; it does a standout job of filling the viewer in on everything they should know about the island\u2019s history. But its placement within the final season doesn\u2019t sit right. With two episodes to go before the last episode, viewers want to spend time with their favourite characters \u2013 not two objectionable kids. Still, Allison Janney is a welcome addition to any TV show, and the creation of the smoke monster doesn\u2019t disappoint.\n\n86. Sundown \u2013 Season six, episode five\n\nSayid is a bit of a casualty of season six. This episode is the last true time we see him as the character we know and love, save for his heroic sacrifice nine episodes later. There\u2019s no denying the climactic smoke monster showdown at the temple is effective, and there are some great Kate reaction shots as she sees the \u201cresurrected\u201d Locke for the first time.\n\n85. Tricia Tanaka Is Dead \u2013 Season three, episode 10\n\nLoved by many, this outing \u2013 more popularly referred to as \u201cthe car episode\u201d \u2013 could well be the last one in which all the survivors (bar Jack and Locke) are together on the beach. Should be cherished for that reason alone.\n\n84. I Do \u2013 Season three, episode six\n\n\u201cKate, dammit, RUN.\u201d It\u2019s hard not to be won over by that doozy of an ending that sees Jack finally take control of his situation to save Kate and Sawyer\u2019s lives. It\u2019s a terrific climax to the divisive six episodes that started season three. Probably Kate\u2019s worst flashbacks, mind.\n\n83. Everybody Hates Hugo \u2013 Season two, episode four\n\nTries to calm things down after the hatch drama with mixed results. Most memorable for that lovely final shot of Rose saving a chocolate bar for Bernard, who we finally learn is alive on the other side of the island.\n\n82. Every Man for Himself \u2013 Season three, episode four\n\nThe underrated highlight of season three\u2019s controversial opening mini-season, largely thanks to the second island reveal and the ever-fantastic Josh Holloway. Sawyer\u2019s scenes with Ben are dynamite and a fine precursor to the terrific work Michael Emerson goes on to deliver.\n\n81. The Lie \u2013 Season five, episode two\n\nThe one where Hurley throws a hot pocket at Ben Linus. It\u2019s a sturdy enough, if completely ridiculous episode, that sees Hugo run amok around Los Angeles with an unconscious Sayid. Most memorable for the scene that sees him come clean about the island to his mother.\n\n80. Maternity Leave \u2013 Season two, episode 15\n\nKate and Claire trek to the medical station she was taken to after being abducted by Ethan in season one. Pretty intense, although an overload of exposition threatens to derail it. Locke getting rattled by the imprisoned Henry Gale\u2019s mind games is a highlight.\n\n79. Catch-22 \u2013 Season three, episode 17\n\nThe reason why Desmond uses the word \u201cbrother\u201d doesn\u2019t need an explanation, but that\u2019s exactly what we get. The on-island antics involve a tense boys trip into the jungle that future-seeing Desmond knows has fatal consequences for Charlie \u2013 right up until he saves him at the last minute. It doesn\u2019t really get much better than the shocking opening sequence, but it\u2019s pretty solid\n\n78. Confidence Man \u2013 Season one, episode eight\n\nShannon loses her asthma inhaler so Jack and Sayid\u2026 torture Sawyer. Slightly farfetched, but has a few classic season one moments (that kiss). The non-diegetic use of music in the closing moments as Sayid departs the camp has always bothered me, though.\n\n77. \u2026and Found \u2013 Season two, episode five\n\nHear me out: this is low-key one of the best written episodes of the entire second season. Your enjoyment depends on just how invested in Sun and Jin\u2019s story you are, but regardless, the flashbacks are as heartwarming as they come and the tail-end survivors come into their own.\n\n76. Tabula Rasa \u2013 Season one, episode three\n\nActually a very decent episode that picks up the seeds planted in the two-part pilot and continues the story in a tantalising manner. Kate\u2019s flashbacks peaked very early thanks to the one-armed, mortgage-paying Ray, who Kate has to thank for being on Oceanic 815 in the first place.\n\n75. The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham \u2013 Season five, episode seven\n\nThis episode should be better; Locke attempting to convince everyone to return to the island struggles to live up to expectations. Still, there\u2019s some stellar stuff (Abbadon\u2019s death; Hurley\u2019s casual conviction that Locke\u2019s a ghost) and spending time in Terry O\u2019Quinn\u2019s company is always a joy.\n\n74. Dr Linus \u2013 Season six, episode seven\n\nIt\u2019s odd to see Ben on the backfoot, so this episode takes some getting used to. As ever, Michael Emerson pulls off what\u2019s asked of him and his final \u201cno one will have me\u201d is (kind of) the start of his previously unthinkable redemption. It\u2019s genuinely comforting to see him reunited with Alex, albeit as teacher and student, in the flashsideways, too.\n\n73. Namaste \u2013 Season five, episode eight\n\nOne of those hectic episodes which puts things in place for the final stretch of the season, gets swallowed up by the sheer amount of things going on. It\u2019s all extremely fun, though.\n\n72. The Last Recruit \u2013 Season six, episode 13\n\nAn air of finality encroaches upon this episode, which effectively raises the stakes and officially sees Jack accept his destiny and Sawer become the group\u2019s de facto leader. It also successfully amps up the flashsideways scenes. Tears along at a brisk pace.\n\n71. Collision \u2013 Season two, episode eight\n\nAKA the reunion episode: Rose and Bernard, Sun and Jin, Ana-Lucia and Jack. Packs a lot in \u2013 and that shot of Sayid holding Shannon\u2019s corpse near the end is devastating.\n\n70. Eggtown \u2013 Season four, episode four\n\nThe big Aaron reveal at the end of this episode wins me over, and I love the clash of leadership tactics between Locke and Kate at the Barracks. It also has Sawyer drinking DHARMA wine from a box. An unfairly disliked outing, in all honesty.\n\n69. Raised by Another \u2013 Season one, episode 10\n\nSome intriguing flashbacks (Claire\u2019s psychic) and a killer Ethan twist make this one of the early greats that was much-talked about at the time, but admittedly doesn\u2019t pack as much of a punch upon re-watch.\n\n68. Numbers \u2013 Season one, episode 18\n\nThis should be upper tier Lost, but it\u2019s not. However, it has many memorable moments and is the first time a bunch of characters stray quite far from camp together. The one that made everyone want to go back and see if they could spot the cursed numbers in every single previous episode.\n\n67. House of the Rising Sun \u2013 Season one, episode six\n\nJin used to be such a bad guy! Huge and brilliantly-deployed revelation regarding Sun\u2019s ability to speak English. Camp gets divided between beach and caves. Dependable early episode.\n\n66. ? \u2013 Season two, episode 21\n\nA discovery of yet another hatch rocks Locke\u2019s faith in the button. The episode would probably be better if it hadn\u2019t come just after one of the most gut-wrenching endings in Lost history.\n\n65. Solitary \u2013 Season one, episode nine\n\nOur introduction to Danielle Rousseau. At the time, it was the most exciting episode of television I\u2019d ever seen. Now, it feels surprisingly restrained. The whispers at the end is fun, as is \u201cthe first \u2013 and hopefully last \u2013 Island Open\u201d.\n\n64. Jughead \u2013 Season five, episode three\n\nAn oddity of an episode that\u2019s high on Desmond and Richard Alpert \u2013 a surefire way of guaranteeing a watchable hour of television. Provides the first hint that the time-hopping will have fateful consequences for those stuck on the island.\n\n63. LA X \u2013 Season six, episode one and two\n\nHas the tough job of presenting the flashsideways, so season six\u2019s opener falls victim to its own ambition. Having to say goodbye to Juliet all over again is more than this writer can bear, but the survivors\u2019s arrival at the Temple is supremely exciting. The weakest of Lost\u2019s season premieres.\n\n62. White Rabbit \u2013 Season one, episode five\n\nOur first foray into Jack\u2019s past with his father, a relationship closer to the heart of the series than we could have ever thought at the time. Some terrific (non-shouty) Jack and Locke stuff, too.\n\n61. The 23rd Psalm \u2013 Season two, episode 10\n\nCharlie and Eko have many cool moments and the big smoke monster scene is a gem, but the ending signals a rocky and quite frustrating arc to come for Charlie, which in retrospect, puts a bit of a downer on proceedings.\n\n60. Par Avion \u2013 Season three, episode 12\n\nThe best of Claire\u2019s episodes. Her flashbacks are interesting and stand out for casually revealing the bombshell that she\u2019s Jack\u2019s half-sister. Meanwhile, the Mikhail scenes are memorable and the indelible ending \u2013 Jack playing football with Mr Friendly \u2013 is a stone-cold Lost classic.\n\n59. \u2026In Translation \u2013 Season one, episode 17\n\nThe start of the Jin evolution. Boasts a very rare moment of introducing a big mystery (who burnt the raft?) and answering it within the same episode (it was Walt). Perfect setup for Hurley\u2019s first flashback episode, also, as his walkman dies on him while he\u2019s listening to Damien Rice.\n\n58. A Tale of Two Cities \u2013 Season three, episode one\n\nThe opening scene is vintage Lost, but the remainder of the episode falls surprisingly flat. It introduces future greatest character Juliet, though, and Matthew Fox is brilliant depicting the imprisoned Jack\u2019s stubbornness right through to the acceptance of his situation.\n\n57. One of Us \u2013 Season three, episode 16\n\nA briskly-paced episode that features some crucial Others details courtesy of Juliet\u2019s flashbacks. The ending is a treat.\n\n56. Confirmed Dead \u2013 Season four, episode two\n\nNikki and Paulo aside, Lost always nailed character introductions, and this episode was firm evidence of the fact. Each of the four new arrivals from the freighter \u2013 Daniel, Miles, Charlotte and Frank \u2013 are brilliantly drawn from the off and Locke\u2019s left-field \u201cWhat is the monster?\u201d to Ben in the final scene, is a blindsiding crack-up.\n\n55. S.O.S \u2013 Season two, episode 19\n\nOne of the most charming episodes of Lost that places the long-awaited flashback spotlight on Rose and Bernard, with L Scott Caldwell on Emmy-worthy form. A good one for Jack and Kate-shipping Jaters too as the pair get \u201ccaught in a net\u201d before they happen upon traitor-in-waiting, Michael.\n\n54. The Whole Truth \u2013 Season two, episode 16\n\nFive words: \u201cYou guys got any milk?\u201d Low-key one of the shows greatest final scenes.\n\n53. Not In Portland \u2013 Season three, episode seven\n\nJuliet takes centre stage in an episode that shows how she came to be one of the Others on the island. The discovery that she\u2019s just as imprisoned as Jack is a brilliant one that hints at the turmoil of an altruistic character who\u2019ll always put others before herself.\n\n52. Ab Aeterno \u2013 Season six, episode nine\n\nThe mystery surrounding the ageless Richard Alpert\u2019s immortality gets ticked off in suitably epic fashion as we\u2019re treated to a flashback dating back to 1867. Not the cracker some will have you believe, but the perfect episode to show someone who\u2019s in need of a concise explanation as to why the hell everyone\u2019s on the island.\n\n51. D.O.C. \u2013 Season three, episode 18\n\nAnother underrated episode. It\u2019s the one where we learn whether Sun conceived on or off the island and offers our first true introduction to parachutist Naomi. Her revelation at the end \u2013 that the bodies of all the survivors were found at the bottom of the ocean \u2013 was the tip of an iceberg that the show would explore for the next few seasons.\n\n50. Three Minutes \u2013 Season two, episode 22\n\nPure finale build-up, but The Others stuff is great and Sun\u2019s proclamation of \u201cboat\u201d as the survivors are gathered around Ana-lucia and Libby\u2019s graves, always brings chills to the spine.\n\n49. Whatever Happened Happened \u2013 Season five, episode 11\n\nKate has never been more frustrating (leave Roger alone!), but Miles\u2019s explanation of the time travel situation they\u2019re all in is the best explanation of time travel there has ever been.\n\n48. Dave \u2013 Season two, episode 18\n\nBarely anything in it has any bearing on the show\u2019s future, but there\u2019s no denying \u201cDave\u201d is a cultish thrill ride \u2013 and that cliffhanger ending with Libby is Lost at its most spine-tingling.\n\n47. Follow the Leader \u2013 Season five, episode 15\n\nThe one where Jack finally settles on a purpose. That it happens to be detonating a hydrogen bomb, in the hope of rewriting their futures as plane crash survivors, is slightly zany, but it sets up the season five finale rather adeptly.\n\n46. Outlaws \u2013 Season one, episode 16\n\nNo TV show has used the game of I Never to get across motivations of its characters as successfully as Lost. The right level of mystery (the whispers make their return) and humanity (we learn more about Sawyer\u2019s fractured childhood) builds to a beautifully understated climax, as Sawyer inexplicably realises, he had a chance encounter with Jack\u2019s father before the crash.\n\n45. The Little Prince \u2013 Season five, episode four\n\nA really fun one! This episode resurrects one of the greatest moments in Lost history: the hatch light being switched on. It also has that cool scene that sees the crew shot at by unknown assailants from the outrigger, and features one of my favourite reaction shots in the whole series, as Jin regains consciousness and realises, after meeting a young Rousseau, that he\u2019s in 1988.\n\n44. He\u2019s Our You \u2013 Season five, episode 10\n\nAfter being mistaken for one of the Others back in the 1970s, Sayid \u2013 locked up by DHARMA \u2013 meets a young Ben and decides to put a bullet in his chest. Lost at its coldest. Features a brilliant cameo from yet another Deadwood cast member: William Sanderson.\n\n43. Do No Harm \u2013 Season one, episode 20\n\nThis episode marks the first death of a main character, and while Boone may not have been many people\u2019s favourite, it does a good job of making you feel the effect of his loss on the castaways. Sun becoming Jack\u2019s right-hand medic was a terrific way to integrate her as a major player. Also, the birth of Aaron is bittersweet because, y\u2019know, life and death.\n\n42. Orientation \u2013 Season two, episode three\n\n\u201cWhy do you find it so hard to believe?\u201d \u201cWhy do you find it so easy?\u201d Season two was all about the button in the hatch and the ensuing battle between faith and science \u2013 believing it needed to be pushed to \u201csave the world\u201d versus the belief that nothing would happen should they let the timer run down to zero. The climactic exchange between Jack and Locke encapsulates this perfectly, the former shaken after realising he\u2019d seen Desmond \u201cin another life\u201d before the crash.\n\n41. Enter-77 \u2013 Season three, episode 11\n\nA throwback episode to Lost of old, following the shake-up presented in the first half of season three. Sayid, Kate and Locke \u2013 a formidable trio \u2013 happen across Mikhail in the jungle and the ensuing episode sees each character trying to battle for the upper hand. Sayid\u2019s flashbacks too are among his greatest with Naveen Andrews showing he was one of the best actors on the show.\n\n40. Because You Left \u2013 Season five, episode one\n\nA fantastic opener that sets season five\u2019s time-hopping tone perfectly. It\u2019s an episode that must have seemed impossible to pull off in the writers room, but it\u2019s done so damn entertainingly that it certainly ranks as the most fun season premiere.\n\n39. Dead Is Dead \u2013 Season five, episode 12\n\nGetting to spend time in the company of Ben Linus is always a treasure. This episode gives us the first true hint that something\u2019s wrong with the resurrected Locke, and the final CGI-heavy scene \u2013 in which Ben is judged by the smoke monster \u2013 is admirably acted by Emerson.\n\n38. The Economist \u2013 Season four, episode three\n\nOf all the characters that would go on to leave the island, it was Sayid whose story had the bleakest outcome (I don\u2019t think we see him smile from this point onwards). Consequently, the sequence that sees him leave the island on the helicopter, on his way to investigate the crew on the freighter, is a bittersweet one considering his fate.\n\n37. The Long Con \u2013 Season two, episode 13\n\nThe clue to this episode is in the title. It plays like a tropical island version of Hustle that sees Sawyer trick everyone from Kate and Ana-Lucia to Locke. Sure, it\u2019s completely filler but when a network orders 24 episodes per season, you\u2019re gonna have those \u2013 and they manage to make the repercussions of Sawyer\u2019s actions trickle into the following season\u2019s episodes.\n\n36. The Candidate \u2013 Season six, episode 14\n\n\u201cThe Candidate\u201d really goes there. Killing off three main characters with just a handful of episodes to go is a bold move, and one that effectively gets everyone where they need to be emotionally, in preparation for the final episodes. The scene where Kate, Hurley and Jack break down in tears, mourning the deaths of Sun, Jin and Sayid is Lost at its most painful and human.\n\n35. The Beginning of the End \u2013 Season four, episode one\n\nThe title sums it up well: this is an oddly understated season premiere that raises the stakes in previously unimaginable ways. Lost is extremely different from this point onwards and the episode marks the last time all the characters are in one place before they split into team Jack and Locke. Quietly devastating, truth be told.\n\n34. Greatest Hits \u2013 Season three, episode 21\n\nThis episode uses Charlie\u2019s impending death to tug at the heartstrings; each flashback scene shows us the memories he considers to be the greatest in his life. Perhaps the most effective finale set-up episode of them all.\n\n33. The Hunting Party \u2013 Season two, episode 11\n\nA terrific episode filled with character moments that just make sense (Michael taking off after Walt; Sawyer wanting revenge for being shot on the raft; Kate following the search party despite Jack instructing her not to). The showdown with Mr Friendly in the jungle continues to establish the Others as a terrifying force, and Sawyer damn well near steals the season with several hilarious quotes (\u201cOh yeah, there\u2019s my favourite leaf\u201d).\n\n32. Lockdown \u2013 Season 2, episode 17\n\nWhen \u201cLockdown\u201d flies, it soars. It has mystery (the blast door map), some what-the-f*** moments (the food drop) and a bombshell of an ending, where we finally learn that the man who\u2019s been saying he\u2019s Henry Gale for the past three episodes, is someone else altogether.\n\n31. 316 \u2013 Season five, episode six\n\nA mammoth episode exemplifying that Lost, in its penultimate season, had no time to waste. After weeks of seeing the Oceanic Six preparing to return to the island, the episode starts with Jack back in the place he\u2019d been so desperate to get off just one season before \u2013 and ends with him coming face-to-face with Jin in his DHARMA overalls. Earns serious marks for that.\n\n30. What They Died For \u2013 Season six, episode 15\n\nA hugely emotional penultimate episode feature Jack accepting what he believes to be his fate as protector of the island. Puts everything in place for the last ever episode poignantly, and with just the right amount of nostalgia.\n\n29. LaFleur \u2013 Season five, episode seven\n\nThe Sawyer and Juliet reveal ranks as one of Lost\u2019s most heartwarming. Seeing them build a life together as members of DHARMA three years after Jack and company left the island is such a monumental twist, but it unfolds within the episode in such an understated way. One of Sawyer\u2019s most crucial episodes \u2013 and tissues at the ready for that final reunion scene.\n\n28. The Variable \u2013 Season five, episode 14\n\nThe writers didn\u2019t hold back for the 100th episode of Lost, delivering what must be the episode that benefits most from rewatch. Don\u2019t care about Daniel Faraday\u2019s backstory? You will when you realise what fate has in store for him \u2013 something made even more heartbreaking with each visit.\n\n27. This Place Is Death \u2013 Season five, episode five\n\nThis is one of my season five favourites and yes, it\u2019s because it\u2019s the first time we see the four-toed statue in its entirety. Also, the Charlotte and Daniel scene, in which she tells him he\u2019s the \u201cscary man\u201d who told her to leave the island when she was a child, is extremely creepy. Fantastically written.\n\n26. Pilot \u2013 Part 2 \u2013 Season one, episode two\n\nSeparates the castaways in such a perfect way that the viewer's able to get a perfect sense of each character and their dynamic within the group. People might still be joking about that polar bear scene, but everyone's reactions are so on the money \u2013 and the revelation that Kate's a fugitive is the show's first shocker.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 25 best Lost episodes Show all 25 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 25 best Lost episodes 1/25 25. All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues \u2013 Season one, episode 12 The first fast-paced episode of Lost. The flashbacks detail one of the most crucial points from Jack\u2019s past (destroying his father\u2019s career), while Jack and Kate finding Charlie blindfolded and hanging lifeless from the tree, never fails to knock the wind out of viewers\u2019s lungs; I\u2019m still convinced he\u2019ll die every time I watch it. We\u2019re also introduced to the hatch, something that went on to shape the future of the show in unthinkable ways. 2/25 24. Happily Ever After \u2013 Season six, episode 11 It may take a while to get going, but this episode is vintage Lost for linking the flashsideways to the island events in such a gratifying, moving way. Extended Desmond episodes are always a joy, and this one was no different. A terrific precursor to the series finale. ABC 3/25 23. There\u2019s No Place Like Home \u2013 Part 1 \u2013 Season four, episode 12 This episode opens with a pinch-yourself scene that first-time viewers never expect to see: survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 reuniting with their loved ones \u2013 characters we\u2019ve seen in their respective flashbacks across the past four seasons. The opening part, to a mammoth three-part finale, does an effective job of letting you know we\u2019re about to see how the Oceanic Six came to leave the island. Because of that, anticipation levels are through the roof from the first second. 4/25 22. The Other 48 Days \u2013 Season two, episode seven Back in the early days, a format shakeup in Lost was enough to cause heart palpitations \u2013 so the realisation you\u2019re about to watch the first 48 days, through the eyes of the tail-end survivors, is cause for excitement. The dawning realisation, that these characters had it a lot harder than the ones we\u2019ve spent an entire season with, is a chilling one, and the episode is executed admirably. 5/25 21. The Substitute \u2013 Season six, episode four One of the final season\u2019s true gems, this episode is evidence that Terry O\u2019Quinn is one of television\u2019s acting greats. His performance as the terrifying Man In Black, in the guise of Locke, is remarkable, and his team up with Sawyer makes for some sizzling interplay. The final scene showing the names of the remaining candidates and their corresponding numbers in the cave (4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42) is an astonishing reveal, that\u2019s crucial in understanding the show. 6/25 20. Pilot \u2013 Part 1 \u2013 Season one, episode one At the time, Lost\u2019s pilot episode was the most expensive ever made ($14m) \u2013 and its opening 10 minutes still takes the breath away. The show\u2019s snappy dialogue is there from the offset and the series premiere does an impressive job of introducing the ensemble, while peppering in the right amount of mystery: first and foremost, Lost is about ordinary people and how they react to the extraordinary things going on around them. 7/25 19. One of Them \u2013 Season two, episode 14 Some fans might be surprised to see this episode so high, but the scene in which Sayid goes against Jack\u2019s wishes to torture new arrival Henry Gale in the Swan station\u2019s armoury \u2013 all while the hatch timer gets closer and closer to zero \u2013 is Lost at its most tense, and earns this episode\u2019s high placement, tree frog subplot or no tree frog subplot. 8/25 18. Live Together, Die Alone \u2013 Season two, episode 23 and 24 The first Desmond flashbacks of the series are some of the show\u2019s strongest. This finale is a brilliantly-paced exploration intring some pretty staggering scenes as Jack takes Jacob\u2019s baton and accepts what he thio one of Lost\u2019s most important characters that finds time for some bombshells (Des crashed the plane), the conclusion to the button debate (Locke\u2019s \u201cI was wrong\u201d remains a huge turning point for the character), and our first off-island scene taking place in the present. 9/25 17. Expos\u00e9 \u2013 Season three, episode 14 In the world of television, how do you rectify something the viewers aren\u2019t happy with? In Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse\u2019s case, they somehow turn it into a positive \u2013 albeit in the most twisted way imaginable. Nikki and Paulo are introduced early into the show\u2019s third season, as survivors who we\u2019re led to believe have been there the entire time. The fans revolted and poor Nikki and Paulo found themselves buried alive in a Twilight Zone-style episode that\u2019s hated as much as it\u2019s loved. \u201cExpos\u00e9\u201d is filler, yes, but it\u2019s so deliciously inventive that it deserves a high ranking. 10/25 16. Cabin Fever \u2013 Season four, episode 11 Catnip for Locke fans. The scene in which he speaks to Christian Shephard in Jacob\u2019s cabin is one of the greats, and does a good job at trying to make Claire more important, by throwing her in for good measure. One of the most bonkers final lines to any TV episode: \u201cHe said, \u2018We have to move the island.\u2019\u201d 11/25 15. Flashes Before Your Eyes \u2013 Season three, episode eight When Desmond turns the failsafe key, he not only throws himself back in time but directly into the heart of something that makes Lost so great. This episode is the first to play around with the flashback format and it does it in such a bold way that it can only make you hyped for what\u2019s to come \u2013 even if it means the death of poor Charlie. 12/25 14. The Man Behind the Curtain \u2013 Season three, episode 20 Ben talking to an empty chair in Jacob\u2019s cabin may not have won Michael Emerson an Emmy, but it stands out as some of the best acting this series ever saw (he was beaten that year by his co-star Terry O\u2019Quinn, which is fair enough). Locke \u2013 and the viewer \u2013 are promised answers in this episode and although the end product raises more questions, it does so in such dazzling fashion, it\u2019s hard to be miffed. One to watch with the light\u2019s off. 13/25 13. The Incident \u2013 Season five, episode 16 and 17 The feeling of doom that pervades \u201cThe Incident\u201d actually makes it the least enjoyable, but no less fantastic Lost finale \u2013 and as for that change-up of the Lost logo\u2019s colours at the end? It\u2019s a stunning move. Imagine having to wait nine months for a new episode after seeing that for the first time.. 14/25 12. The Brig \u2013 Season three, episode 19 Lost gave one of the show\u2019s best characters (Sawyer) the resolution he \u2013 or indeed we \u2013 never thought he\u2019d be granted in such a flawless manner. Some may guess that Locke\u2019s con-man father is the guy Josh Holloway\u2019s character has been hunting since childhood, but the reveal is so organic, so well-constructed \u2013 so beautifully done \u2013 that it\u2019s a struggle to breathe when watching it. Holloway is never better in Lost than in this episode. 15/25 11. Two for the Road \u2013 Season two, episode 20 \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d BANG. The ending of \u201cTwo for the Road\u201d is Lost in shocking mode. It dispatches of not one, but two characters at the hands of a character you\u2019d never suspect. What\u2019s refreshing is that the episode earns the surprise \u2013 it\u2019s so neatly folded into the overarching plot of what\u2019s happening elsewhere, that it\u2019s a strong example of the writers working at the top of their game. It doesn\u2019t matter how you feel about Ana-Lucia; your heart can\u2019t help but break seeing her corpse lying there on the sofa, moments after letting the weight of the world off her shoulders. 16/25 10. Walkabout \u2013 Season one, episode four The moment in which every viewer realises Lost is going to be different from most other TV shows. Think you\u2019re watching a standard castaway drama? Think again. The Locke twist ranks as one of the show\u2019s greatest. 17/25 9. Deus Ex Machina \u2013 Season one, episode 19 For me, the final four minutes of \u201cDeus Ex Machina\u201d spring the hairs on end harder than any other moment in the entire series. Back in the heady days of season one, when the toe was merely being dipped into the giant pool of mysteries, that light shining through the hatch window was earth-shattering. When accompanied with Michael Giacchino\u2019s score and Locke\u2019s most heartbreaking flashbacks, it results in TV gold. 18/25 8. Man of Science, Man of Faith \u2013 Season two, episode one Let\u2019s be honest: the season two opening is probably the greatest start to any episode of any TV show, let alone Lost. After a season of watching the survivors roam the island, being plonked into an uncertain location with a completely new character is at once hugely mystifying and exciting. It switches up the show and is the perfect way to alert the audience that, with the revelation of what\u2019s down the hatch, Lost is about to open doors some viewers may not want to enter. 19/25 7. The Shape of Things to Come \u2013 Season four, episode nine Whew. A gem of an episode that boasts everything required to make Lost the most watchable show on television. Action (the assault on the Barracks), mystery (Dr Ray\u2019s washed up body), heartbreak (Keamy\u2019s brutal massacre of Alex), and razor-sharp dialogue (look no further than the climactic Ben Linus and Charles Widmore clash). There\u2019s also the greatest smoke monster appearance as Ben summons him to take out Widmore\u2019s mercenary crew. A tornado of an episode. 20/25 6. The End \u2013 Season six, episode 16 and 17 The last episode of Lost is both divisive and extremely misunderstood, even though I\u2019m still not really sure why. But, for those who can detect the show\u2019s modus operandi in the first season \u2013 that what you\u2019re watching is ultimately about the characters experiencing the mystery \u2013 the final hours of Lost are an all-round emotional and overwhelmingly cathartic experience. Not all the mysteries are answered, but are all things tied up in real life? \u201cThe End\u201d is an impressively balanced conclusion to an envelope-pushing series, which proves everything that happened actually did happen. If you\u2019re one of those who fell victim to the incorrect \u201cthey were dead all along\u201d train of thought, a friendly suggestion: pay attention next time. 21/25 5. There\u2019s No Place Like Home \u2013 Season four, episode 13 and 14 The freighter explosion; the helicopter crash; the frozen donkey wheel \u2013 the island literally moving. These are all scenes that featured in the same finale and, in lesser hands, it could have been a disaster. But thanks to unabashed hard work, the season four conclusion was Lost at its most ambitious, crazy and downright exhausting. 22/25 4. The Man from Tallahassee \u2013 Season three, episode 13 For a mid-season episode, \u201cThe Man from Tallahassee\u201d had no right being this good. Seeing Jack, Kate and Locke walking around the Others\u2019 houses is exciting as hell and the Locke and Ben scenes are, in my opinion, the best acted and written scenes in the entire show. The out-of-nowhere twist ending only serves to make this episode more of a classic in my eyes. 23/25 3. The Constant \u2013 Season four, episode five There\u2019s no doubt the greatest non-finale episode of Lost is \u201cThe Constant\u201d. It\u2019s a masterclass that\u2019s worthy of being cited as one of the best things Damon Lindeloff and Carlton Cuse have ever done. Positioning Desmond and Penny as two lovers separated by space and time sounds too complex to explore in a 40-minute episode, but in actual fact, it\u2019s one of the most accessible Lost episodes in its history, thanks to the message of love at its heart. \u201cThe Constant\u201d is an episode that has and will continue to inspire other television writers to come. Everybody involved should be proud of the work they put in \u2013 episodes like this come around very rarely. 24/25 2. Exodus \u2013 Season one, episode 23, 24 and 25 After enjoying success as one of the most-watched new shows of all time in 2004, it wouldn\u2019t have been surprising for Lost to buckle under the pressure and screw up its season one finale. Instead, it went ahead and established Lost as a future classic that was very much here to stay. \u201cExodus\u201d merges the smaller character moments (the Sun and Jin reconciliation) with the heavy-hitting sequences (the raft launch), the pedal-to-the-metal action (Locke getting attacked by Smokey), and the nail-biting plot twists (Walt getting kidnapped off the raft). It was the perfect culmination of everything that had preceded it, and left you salivating for more. The scope of this episode might have lessened over the years, but at the time of its premiere, the excitement levels were joyous. Without the success of \u201cExodus\u201d, Lost wouldn\u2019t have been encouraged to take the bold steps it did right through to its finale. 25/25 1. Through the Looking Glass \u2013 Season three, episode 22 and 23 It\u2019s hard to think of a time before \u201cThrough the Looking Glass\u201d had been unleashed upon the world, but it was certainly a less inspired one. Whether you\u2019re a Lost fan or not, everyone can settle on the fact that it\u2019s one of the greatest finales in TV history \u2013 and one that not only changes the very fabric of its own existence, but the medium of television as a whole. That it does so in such an assured, sublime and damn unexpected way is testament to this show\u2019s genius. It\u2019s Lost at its most iconic (see: Not Penny\u2019s Boat and \u201cWe have to go back!\u201d) and has embedded itself into the history books for encouraging everyone involved in TV to think outside the box. 1/25 25. All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues \u2013 Season one, episode 12 The first fast-paced episode of Lost. The flashbacks detail one of the most crucial points from Jack\u2019s past (destroying his father\u2019s career), while Jack and Kate finding Charlie blindfolded and hanging lifeless from the tree, never fails to knock the wind out of viewers\u2019s lungs; I\u2019m still convinced he\u2019ll die every time I watch it.

Action (the assault on the Barracks), mystery (Dr Ray\u2019s washed up body), heartbreak (Keamy\u2019s brutal massacre of Alex), and razor-sharp dialogue (look no further than the climactic Ben Linus and Charles Widmore clash). There\u2019s also the greatest smoke monster appearance as Ben summons him to take out Widmore\u2019s mercenary crew. A tornado of an episode. 20/25 6. The End \u2013 Season six, episode 16 and 17 The last episode of Lost is both divisive and extremely misunderstood, even though I\u2019m still not really sure why. But, for those who can detect the show\u2019s modus operandi in the first season \u2013 that what you\u2019re watching is ultimately about the characters experiencing the mystery \u2013 the final hours of Lost are an all-round emotional and overwhelmingly cathartic experience. Not all the mysteries are answered, but are all things tied up in real life? \u201cThe End\u201d is an impressively balanced conclusion to an envelope-pushing series, which proves everything that happened actually did happen. If you\u2019re one of those who fell victim to the incorrect \u201cthey were dead all along\u201d train of thought, a friendly suggestion: pay attention next time. 21/25 5. There\u2019s No Place Like Home \u2013 Season four, episode 13 and 14 The freighter explosion; the helicopter crash; the frozen donkey wheel \u2013 the island literally moving. These are all scenes that featured in the same finale and, in lesser hands, it could have been a disaster. But thanks to unabashed hard work, the season four conclusion was Lost at its most ambitious, crazy and downright exhausting. 22/25 4. The Man from Tallahassee \u2013 Season three, episode 13 For a mid-season episode, \u201cThe Man from Tallahassee\u201d had no right being this good. Seeing Jack, Kate and Locke walking around the Others\u2019 houses is exciting as hell and the Locke and Ben scenes are, in my opinion, the best acted and written scenes in the entire show. The out-of-nowhere twist ending only serves to make this episode more of a classic in my eyes. 23/25 3. The Constant \u2013 Season four, episode five There\u2019s no doubt the greatest non-finale episode of Lost is \u201cThe Constant\u201d. It\u2019s a masterclass that\u2019s worthy of being cited as one of the best things Damon Lindeloff and Carlton Cuse have ever done. Positioning Desmond and Penny as two lovers separated by space and time sounds too complex to explore in a 40-minute episode, but in actual fact, it\u2019s one of the most accessible Lost episodes in its history, thanks to the message of love at its heart. \u201cThe Constant\u201d is an episode that has and will continue to inspire other television writers to come. Everybody involved should be proud of the work they put in \u2013 episodes like this come around very rarely. 24/25 2. Exodus \u2013 Season one, episode 23, 24 and 25 After enjoying success as one of the most-watched new shows of all time in 2004, it wouldn\u2019t have been surprising for Lost to buckle under the pressure and screw up its season one finale. Instead, it went ahead and established Lost as a future classic that was very much here to stay. \u201cExodus\u201d merges the smaller character moments (the Sun and Jin reconciliation) with the heavy-hitting sequences (the raft launch), the pedal-to-the-metal action (Locke getting attacked by Smokey), and the nail-biting plot twists (Walt getting kidnapped off the raft). It was the perfect culmination of everything that had preceded it, and left you salivating for more. The scope of this episode might have lessened over the years, but at the time of its premiere, the excitement levels were joyous. Without the success of \u201cExodus\u201d, Lost wouldn\u2019t have been encouraged to take the bold steps it did right through to its finale. 25/25 1. Through the Looking Glass \u2013 Season three, episode 22 and 23 It\u2019s hard to think of a time before \u201cThrough the Looking Glass\u201d had been unleashed upon the world, but it was certainly a less inspired one. Whether you\u2019re a Lost fan or not, everyone can settle on the fact that it\u2019s one of the greatest finales in TV history \u2013 and one that not only changes the very fabric of its own existence, but the medium of television as a whole. That it does so in such an assured, sublime and damn unexpected way is testament to this show\u2019s genius. It\u2019s Lost at its most iconic (see: Not Penny\u2019s Boat and \u201cWe have to go back!\u201d) and has embedded itself into the history books for encouraging everyone involved in TV to think outside the box.", "description": "Fifteen years ago \u2013 on 22 September, 2004 \u2013\u00a0Lost was first broadcast in the US.", "authors": ["Jacob Stolworthy"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/21/12/lost.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
