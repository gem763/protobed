Prince Mohammad bin Salman, also known as MbS, was once the promising young face of the Arab monarchy. Now he\u2019s racking up foreign-policy defeats abroad\u2014and facing disturbing murmurs at home.\n\nOver the weekend, Houthi rebels took down a Saudi-mechanized column along the border with Yemen, capturing hundreds of soldiers. Then, the mysterious murder of a royal bodyguard set off alarm bells inside the kingdom.\n\nWith his problems closing in, the crown prince may try one last gambit: a pivot from Washington to Tehran. But it\u2019s risky, and he doesn\u2019t have much room to maneuver.\n\n\u201cVarious Saudis I've spoken to raise the possibility that what is happening could be at the hands of elements inside the Saudi government that want to embarrass MbS because they see him as putting Saudi Arabia in a corner,\u201d said Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute. \u201cIf you were a Saudi, and you were concerned about the future of your country, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s difficult to draw the conclusion that MbS is your first obstacle.\u201d\n\nMbS began his reign with an ambitious foreign policy. He pushed President Donald Trump to escalate against Iran, ramped up the Saudi-led war in Yemen, and launched a dramatic blockade against his rivals in Qatar. Now, his policies are blowing up in his face.\n\nOn September 14, drones and missiles destroyed a desulphurization plant in Abqaiq, knocking out half of Saudi oil exports. But last weekend showed that the worst may be yet to come.\n\nThe weekend of disasters began with an explosive claim by the Houthis, an Iranian-backed rebel army that has vexed the Saudi-backed government in Yemen. On a Houthi-run TV channel, Houthi Brig. Gen. Yahya Saeed announced the defeat of three Saudi brigades in a cross-border raid near the Saudi city of Najran.\n\nIt was impossible to verify whether three brigades\u2014equal to thousands of soldiers\u2014were actually routed, or where the battle took place. And most of the prisoners were dressed in civilian clothes.\n\n\u201cSome reports say that these are Pakistani mercenaries hired by the Saudis. I hear these are Yemeni soldiers who are part of the coalition forces. And the Houthis\u2019 record on truth is pretty disputable, and pretty miserable,\u201d claimed Randa Slim, founding director of the Initiative for Track II Dialogues at the Middle East Institute.\n\nBut the footage released by the Houthis showed images of a clear Saudi humiliation: hundreds of soldiers dropping their weapons in surrender, Houthi fighters joyriding in U.S.-made armored cars, and expensive military equipment in flames. One crewman, his pants stained with bodily fluids, surrendered his tank to Houthi soldiers armed only with rifles.\n\nA day after the attack, the Houthis released 290 prisoners to Saudi Arabia. Both countries have been negotiating a ceasefire, and Saudi Arabia had offered a limited truce in four provinces of Yemen a day before the raid.\n\n\"The Houthis follow a model of negotiating from a position of strength, which is not unique to Iran, but Iran wields it better than almost any other actor in the Middle East,\" explained Foundation for the Defense of Democracies senior fellow Behnam Ben Taleblu. \u201cYou lay out conditions that you know are suboptimal for the adversary, but you induce them to want to take those conditions because of military conditions you have also created that impact the adversary\u2019s calculus.\u201d\n\nSaudi authorities have been silent about the Houthi claims, but worrying reports are leaking out of the country.\n\nOn Sunday, royal bodyguard Gen. Abdulazziz al-Faghm was shot and killed in Jeddah. Saudi-run media blamed the murder on a \u201cpersonal dispute\u201d with a friend named Mamdouh al-Ali. According to a police spokesman, al-Ali murdered the general during a \u201cheated discussion,\u201d and then died in a shootout with local police.\n\nSeveral reports immediately raised questions about the official narrative. Around the time of the murder, Saudi officials were asking \u201cregional intelligence services\u201d about \u201ca number of Saudi citizens,\u201d according to a New York Timesreport from Beirut and Tel Aviv. And a Saudi dissident living abroad, Ghanem al-Dosari, told The New Arab that al-Ali had been part of a team of agents who followed him to London.\n\nRumor-mongers threw fuel on the fire, spreading dramatic gossip about a battle within the palace. Mujtahidd, widely-followed Twitter account in Saudi Arabia, claimed that \u201cal-Faghm was in the palace at the time of the incident and not with a friend,\u201d and that MbS considered al-Faghm part of an \u201cold guard\u201d that was loyal to the House of Saud rather than the crown prince himself.\n\nWhether or not Mujtahidd\u2019s claims are true, they are stirring the pot inside the kingdom. The account boasts 2.2 million followers, and members of the royal family and religious establishment have taken the account seriously enough torespond to its previous claims, both directly and indirectly.\n\nThen, another bad omen: a new $7.3 billion train station in Jeddah suddenlyburst into flames on Sunday afternoon. Thick, black smoke covered the sky. Parsi said that there has been speculation about an \u201cinternal job\u201d by anti-MbS elements.\n\nBy the end of the weekend, Saudi diplomats were springing into action, working to bring MbS a diplomatic victory on the Iranian front.\n\nOn Monday, the Iranian president\u2019s office claimed that they had received a \u201cmessage\u201d from Saudi Arabia. The next day, Iraqi officials announced on Tuesday that they are in the process of setting up a face-to-face Saudi-Iranian meeting.\n\nThe Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York has not responded to a request for comment.\n\n\"They have been trying now for some time to convene a meeting now in Baghdad between Tehran and Saudi Arabia,\u201d Slim told the National Interest. \u201cThere are a number of initiatives right now. But I think unlike previous times, we are now seeing both parties willing to engage in this.\"\n\nThe last major diplomatic breakthrough had occurred in August, when officials from the United Arab Emirates publicly met with their counterparts with Iran and began to withdraw their forces from Yemen. \u201cThe fact that UAE decided to make those public was to send a clear message to the Saudis\u2014and to everybody\u2014that it\u2019s time to rethink that strategy of banking on the Americans defending them from Iran, and banking on the American policy,\u201d Slim said.\n\n\u201cI think Saudi was recalcitrant in the beginning to join the UAE in this repositioning. It was hard for them to internalize the UAE\u2019s decision on Yemen,\u201d she added. \u201cAfter the Abqaiq attack, you have seen the same kind of rethinking in Saudi Arabia of the confidence they have in the Trump administration providing their security in case of a future attack.\u201d\n\nHouthi leadership takes credit for the Abqaiq attack. Britain, France, Germany, and the United States have all pointed the finger at Iran. The Saudi military hedged its bets, claiming that the attack was \u201cunquestionably sponsored\u201d by Iran, but refusing to answer whether Iran itself carried out the attack.\n\nTrump initially warned that he was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a response, but several days later said that it was a \u201csign of strength\u201d not to attack.\n\nIt soon became clear that that military retaliation wasn\u2019t coming, either by the United States or by Saudi Arabia.\n\nA year after the assassination of Saudi-American journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi forces, the kingdom continues to lose friends in Washington, DC. The Abqaiq attack set off a wide backlash against the idea of going to war for Saudi Arabia. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators is now ramping up the pressure on Saudi Arabia over the war in Yemen, which the United Nations says has killed 7,290 civilians and left 24 million in need of humanitarian aid.\n\nSlim emphasized that a variety of \u201cwild cards\u201d could speed up\u2014or torpedo\u2014negotiations with Iran. But one thing is for sure: MbS will not be able to count on a bailout from the United States if his Hail Mary fails.\n\n\u201cAs the U.S. adopts and more restrained military position in the region and signals that it is not going to fight wars for some of its allies, those allies rediscover the utility of diplomacy,\u201d Parsi said. \u201cThis option always existed for Saudi Arabia, but as long as they thought that they could get the United States to fight the wars for it, it had no interest in pursuing diplomacy.\u201d\n\nReprinted with permission from The National Interest.
