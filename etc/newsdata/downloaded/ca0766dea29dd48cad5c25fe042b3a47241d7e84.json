We just can't imagine our lives without her.\n\n\"The people responsible for Joanne's death have left us with our own life sentence.\"", "description": "WARNING - DISTRESSING CONTENT: Lewis Fisher, 21, was seen \"smiling and laughing\" during a high-speed chase moments before Joanne Bailey-Collinge was killed", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Men Media", "Cavendish Press", "Manchester", "Ltd", "Manchester Evening News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637281.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS196102409.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
