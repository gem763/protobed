Her failure prompted her resignation as prime minister and Brexit being pushed back to Oct 31. Johnson replaced her and insists Britain will leave on that date \"do or die\".", "description": "The British government will set out measures to help the United Kingdom prosper after Brexit in the Queen's Speech delivered during the state opening of Parliament on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/14/5da3ca47a310cf3e97a10e64.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
