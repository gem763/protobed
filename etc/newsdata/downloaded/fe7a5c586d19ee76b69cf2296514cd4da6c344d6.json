If not the UK will leave with no deal,\" the source added.\n\nEuropean leaders have reacted tepidly to London's latest propositions.\n\nBritain has urged the EU to intensify talks over the proposals, as European leaders warned it must revise its plans within days in order to conclude a deal this month.\n\nBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the bloc needed to show \"creativity and flexibility\" ahead of October 31 - when Johnson has vowed to end the country's 46 years of EU membership with or without an agreement.\n\nWith the EU asking for reworked proposals within days, an Elysee Palace spokesperson said Macron agreed in his call with Johnson that talks between EU top negotiator Michel Barnier's team and British officials should continue in the coming days \"to assess if an agreement is possible\" by the end of the week.\n\nBarclay reiterated that the ideas Johnson has formally submitted to Brussels were \"a broad landing zone\" and \"intense negotiations\" were now necessary.\n\n\"We've set out very serious proposals including compromise on our side,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"We do need to get into the intensive negotiations on the text to clarify what the deal is.\"\n\nBarclay added the government was considering holding a parliamentary vote ahead of the EU summit to show Brussels the plans have MPs' support.\n\nEuropean leaders had reportedly balked at Britain's request to keep initial discussions on the proposals going through the weekend, and they will resume on Monday, with time running out ahead of the EU summit.\n\n'No more dither'\n\nJohnson began phoning European leaders at the weekend to sell his proposals, speaking to Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Saturday.\n\nRutte tweeted he had told Johnson \"important questions remain about the British proposals\" and \"there is a lot of work to be done ahead\" of the summit.\n\nBarnier told an event in France on Saturday that while an agreement was still possible it \"will be very difficult to reach\".\n\nThe British leader is hoping the threat of a messy no-deal departure in less than three weeks could force the EU to compromise.\n\nBarclay said on Sunday that the government would comply with the legislation requiring Johnson to seek another delay if no deal is reached.\n\nBut in identical articles for two Brexit-backing British tabloids, Johnson insisted the country will leave the bloc later this month.\n\n'Ready to work'\n\nThe British proposals submitted to Brussels Wednesday centre on how to manage the post-Brexit border between British province Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.\n\nJohnson wants Northern Ireland's devolved assembly - which has been suspended for almost three years - to vote every four years on whether to maintain EU rather than British regulations there.\n\nHe has also proposed the province leaves the EU's customs union along with the rest of the UK, with required checks to rely on untried technology and carried out away from the sensitive border.\n\nBrussels has said the plans \"do not provide a basis for concluding an agreement\".\n\nIt sees the potential for rampant smuggling while Ireland is concerned hardline Northern Irish unionists would have an effective veto.\n\nBarclay, who travelled to Amsterdam on Sunday for Brexit talks, suggested Britain could be willing to consider alternative ways of meeting its aims.\n\n\"We're ready to work on that,\" he said.\n\nIreland's leader Leo Varadkar said on Saturday there is \"plenty of time\" to put forward alternatives and he was trying to arrange a meeting with Johnson next week, Irish broadcaster RTE reported.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the European Union he will not delay Brexit beyond October 31, underlining that his latest proposals are a last chance to reach a deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7849/a756efc7cc3e467c96f9b1f54510fbac.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
