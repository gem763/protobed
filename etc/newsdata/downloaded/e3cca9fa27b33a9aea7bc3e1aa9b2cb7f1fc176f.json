Her morning routine continues with a 90-minute workout and soundcheck in preparation for the two-hour show, meeting with fans and press all the while -- a routine she repeats each day she's on the road.\n\n\"It really is amazing how she does it all. Hard work is more important then talent in everything and she has loads of both but the short answer of how she does it is that God\u2019s given her a crazy voice and determination (and energy) to do what He\u2019s called her to do!\" he raved. \"I love watching her do her thing and showing people the gift that God\u2019s given her.\"\n\nUnderwood, who wed Fisher in 2010, continues on the \"Cry Pretty 360 Tour \"with Maddie & Tae and Runaway\" June through Oct. 31, when it wraps in Detroit.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
