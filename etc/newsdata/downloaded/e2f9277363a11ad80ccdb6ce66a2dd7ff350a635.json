Trump said, \"We're talking to a lot of people about that.\" Earlier, Morgan said it will depend on how long it takes to rebuild the islands. \"We would not support returning them to a place where its not safe for them to be,\" he said.\n\nFlorida's two Republican senators, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, have asked the Trump administration to waive any visa requirements for residents of the Bahamas who wish to enter the U.S. In a Sept. 4 letter to the president they wrote: \"This will allow citizens of the Bahamas, who have low visa overstay rates, to stay with family in the United States while the country rebuilds in the wake of Hurricane Dorian's unprecedented destruction.\"\n\nUnder a standing Customs and Border Protection policy, some Bahamians with a passport and police certification who don't have a criminal record can travel to the U.S. without a visa if they are pre-cleared at the airport.\n\nGreg Allen contributed to this report.", "description": "The acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner said no one fleeing the destruction will be refused entry to the U.S.  But he was contradicted a few hours later by President Trump.", "authors": ["Brian Naylor"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/09/gettyimages-1166589989-594x594_wide-b3b7667137db1c0555afac14f9e35c9cef1196ac.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
