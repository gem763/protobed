REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nThe pair, who became household names after winning a gold medal on home ice at the 2010 Olympics, delivered the message late on Tuesday on both of their Twitter accounts through a self-recorded video showing them skating around an empty rink.\n\n\u201cHello everybody, we have some news for everyone, for our fans, people who have supported us, it\u2019s a little bit emotional so bear with us,\u201d said Moir, 32.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know how to tell you, but I guess the best way for us is just to go where we\u2019re most comfortable.\n\n\u201cThis is home for us ... we spent 22 years coasting around the outside of the rink, hanging out together, making programs, trying to just soak up our sporting experience,\u201d Moir continued before Virtue jumped in.\n\n\u201cAfter 22 years, it feels like the right time to step away from the sport,\u201d Virtue, 30, said.\n\n\u201cThis is so personal and emotional for both of us. We\u2019re just so grateful. How lucky are we really that we got to share all of this together and with all of you?\u201d\n\nWhen Virtue and Moir won gold in Vancouver it marked a breakthrough for North American ice dance as the Canadian pair ended a streak of European dominance that had existed since the sport became an Olympic event in 1976.\n\nThey went on to earn a pair of silver medals at the 2014 Sochi Olympics and then won gold in both events four years later in Pyeongchang.\n\nTheir career also includes three world titles, most recently in 2017 when the victory capped an undefeated season, and they went on to led Team Canada as flag-bearers for the opening ceremony at the Pyeongchang Games.\n\nVirtue, who along with Moir, is preparing for a Canada-wide Rock the Rink Tour that runs from Oct. 5-Nov. 23, said the future of Canadian ice dancing is a bright one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in such good hands in Canada. The next generation of skaters is going to blaze new trails, break all of our records and we can\u2019t wait to cheer them on,\u201d said Virtue.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll be there watching,\u201d added Moir.", "description": "Canadian ice dancers Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir have announced their retirement from the sport after an illustrious career in which the duo became the most decorated Olympic figure skaters of all time.", "authors": ["Frank Pingue", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431271785&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H15Y-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
