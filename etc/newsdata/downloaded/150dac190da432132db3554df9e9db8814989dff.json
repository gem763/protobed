Reuters/Rony Muharrman/Antara Foto/Files\n\nToxic haze has blanketed Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia for the past fortnight.\n\nThe haze comes mostly from peatland burned by local farmers.\n\nPeatland is a waterlogged forest that contains high amounts of carbon and doesn\u2019t burn easily.\n\nFarmers drain out the water and burn the carbon-filled forest.\n\nThe high carbon content creates haze that is far thicker and more poisonous than smoke from a normal wildfire.\n\nUnlike regular forest fires, it isn\u2019t put out easily and can go on for months.\n\nIt\u2019s haze season again \u2013 with the toxic smog blanketing Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia clocking in at unhealthy and even hazardous PSI levels for over a week.\n\nApart from some areas of Malaysia, which recorded forest fires during the haze period, burning peatlands in Indonesia\u2019s provinces of Sumatra and Kalimantan are 90 per cent responsible for the haze, according to the World Bank.\n\nThese are the exact same areas the worst haze is coming from.\n\nThick, noxious smoke from Kalimantan, as seen from space on Sept 14. NASA Earth Observatory/Joshua Stevens\n\nOver 14,000 hotspots were recorded in the two areas \u2013 most of which were peatland, the NASA Earth Observatory said.\n\nThe number of high-confidence hotspots recorded in Sumatra and Kalimantan for the month of September shot up to 14,412. It was 68 in January. ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre\n\nPeatlands \u2013 which are found on 3 per cent of the Earth\u2019s surface, including places like Indonesia, Malaysia and even the Arctic \u2013 are swamps that form when a forest floor is continuously saturated with water.\n\nSponge-like peat sucks up water quickly. It contains slowly decaying plant material like dead leaves and wood, which can accumulate up to 20 metres thick.\n\nUnlike other types of terrain, peatland can permanently lock away carbon \u2013 which was previously absorbed by dead leaves during photosynthesis -from the atmosphere, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nTropical peat contains 10 times more carbon than regular mineral soil, according to a paper research on peatlands in Indonesia by local scientists.\n\nBurned peatland in Indonesia releases more smoke than regular forest fires due to the carbon content of peat. Reuters\n\nAccording to a Wired report, dried peat eventually hardens into coal \u2013 which is extremely flammable and contains very high amounts of carbon and toxins.\n\nLuckily \u2013 because it is wet \u2013 peat does not catch fire naturally. Even if it did, the rainfall and humidity in Indonesia stop peatland fires from spreading, according to the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n\nSo why does Indonesia burn so badly? This is because farmers drain squishy peatlands before setting them on fire, meaning all their watery protection is lost, FAO said.\n\nReuters\n\nThis also causes the thick, carbon-rich layer to dry and harden, meaning fires can continue for months, even if the flames on the surface have been put out.\n\nThe only way to extinguish them is to re-flood the area.\n\nAs carbon burns, the smoke created is much thicker and way more poisonous than regular forest fires,NASA Earth Observatory said.\n\nThe carbon is also the source of fine particulate matter, the stuff that makes haze bad for health.\n\nCarbon emissions in Indonesia are concentrated in peatlands, as seen in this NASA vizualisation on Sept 17. NASA Earth Observatory/Joshua Stevens\n\nThese toxic particles include sulphur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide \u2013 which enter a person\u2019s lungs and bloodstream when the haze is breathed in.\n\nThis can cause eye, heart, skin and respiratory problems, according to Singapore\u2019s health ministry.\n\nApart from toxic gas that makes you sick, burning peatland (essentially concentrated coal) also releases insane amounts of greenhouse gases into the environment.\n\nSo far, this year\u2019s Indonesia haze has caused nearly 110 million tons of carbon dioxide to enter the atmosphere, according to environmental site Mongabay.\n\nThat\u2019s the equivalent of using 22 million cars for a period of one year.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Smoldering peat in Sumatra and Kalimantan is behind the poisonous smog.\u00a0.
