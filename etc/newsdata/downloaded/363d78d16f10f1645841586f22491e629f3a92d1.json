(Benjamin C Tankersley/For The Washington Post)\n\nA new four-story, 15-unit condominium building named 11Q stands at 11th and Q streets NW in the District, a stone\u2019s throw from Logan Circle, the U Street corridor and 14th Street.\n\nThe convenient location and the building\u2019s relatively large units attracted Johnny Van Hoosier, who moved in at the beginning of August. He sold his one-bedroom unit in the Atlantic Plumbing condos on Eighth Street NW and bought a two-bedroom unit in 11Q.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much quieter here,\u201d Van Hoosier said. \u201cIt was crazy on weekends in my last place. People were everywhere all the time. Now I have a bigger place. I get a lot of natural light. I can walk to work. I have a huge balcony.\u201d\n\nThe white brick building, highlighted by black-framed windows, stands out as bright and contemporary. The site was previously occupied by dilapidated rowhouses with a few tenants at the end of their tenure. Madison Investments, the builder and developer, bought the property and rebuilt it inside and out.\n\n\u201cWe dug down, went up one story and pushed out the back to maximize the allowable square-footage,\u201d said Barry Madani, co-founder with a brother, Sia Madani, of Madison Investments, a local company.\n\n1 of 14 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Buying New | 11Q in Northwest Washington View Photos Available condos range from $834,900 to $994,900.

The Iranian revolution drove the Madanis from the country, and the family moved to Britain.\n\nThe company served as its own general contractor, managing the building\u2019s design and construction. \u201cThis is our typical management style . . . because it gives us the flexibility to make decisions quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you do a rehab, you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s there until you get into the space.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWith a general contractor there\u2019s a lot of paperwork and time involved in change orders.\u201d\n\n\n\nKitchens have stainless-steel Bosch and Blomberg appliances, quartz counters, Porcelanosa backsplashes, cabinets with soft-close doors and drawers, and under-cabinet lights.

The large kitchen island has a sink and room for four stools. The living and dining area is laid out against a backdrop of big windows.\n\nThe short passage to the two bedrooms has a double-door closet and bathroom. The bathroom has two doors, one from the hallway and the other from the smaller bedroom. The larger bedroom has an en suite bathroom.
