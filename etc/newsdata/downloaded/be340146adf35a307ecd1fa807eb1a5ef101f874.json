REUTERS/Gretchen Ertl/File Photo\n\nNoticeably absent from tallies of Democrats\u2019 pro-impeachment ads is former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading presidential contender who is at the center of the Ukraine controversy involving a call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president that led to last week\u2019s launch of a House impeachment inquiry against the president.\n\nHarris, whose \u201cDude gotta go!\u201d slogan on Trump\u2019s presidency has become a signature chant at her rallies, ran more than 420 Facebook ads that mentioned the words \u201cimpeach\u201d or \u201cimpeachment\u201d in the week through Monday, according to a Reuters analysis of Facebook ad data gathered by the Online Political Ads Transparency Project.\n\nThat represents the majority of the more than 570 new ads by Democratic candidates that week that mentioned impeachment.\n\n(Graphic: Impeachment_buzz, here)\n\n\u201cNo one is above the law. He must be impeached,\u201d according to an ad run by Harris\u2019 Facebook page on Sept. 24.\n\nThe ads are part of an effort by Harris\u2019 campaign, which has been struggling in opinion polls in recent weeks, to position her as a candidate who can take on Trump. In calling for impeachment, Harris, a former California attorney general, has said she is ready to \u201cprosecute the case\u201d against Trump.\n\nThe U.S. senator from California also sent a formal letter to Twitter this week asking the company to suspend Trump\u2019s account. Harris\u2019 campaign did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nBy contrast, Biden, who said last week he would support impeachment if Trump does not cooperate with Congress, has not run any ads on his Facebook page with the word \u201cimpeach\u201d or \u201cimpeachment\u201d in the ad data examined by Reuters, which covered ads launched between May and September, including the week after the impeachment probe opened.\n\nThe references that Biden does make to the controversy in Facebook ads focus more on the personal nature of Trump\u2019s request in a July phone call that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy investigate Biden and his son Hunter - the incident that led to the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted, without evidence, that Biden used his influence as vice president to kill an investigation of a Ukrainian energy company of which Hunter Biden was a board member.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump asked a foreign leader for a \u2018favor\u2019 in an attempt to manufacture a smear campaign against me,\u201d one Biden ad read.\n\nHarris was followed in the tally of impeachment-themed ads by U.S. Senator Cory Booker, who launched at least 99 such ads in the week through Monday. Next was U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran at least 32.\n\nThe ad data published by Facebook, which was collected by computer scientists at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University, includes ad text but not photos or videos.\n\nSome of Harris\u2019 ads call on supporters to sign a card thanking House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi for opening the inquiry, a tactic through which candidates can build their list of potential voters.\n\nTRUMP FUNDRAISING BLITZ\n\nThe candidates\u2019 differing approaches reflect the fact they \u201ceach have their own messages and are likely going after different segments of the Democratic base,\u201d said Kyle Tharp, a spokesman for ACRONYM, a progressive organization which tracks political digital spending.\n\nTrump, the top spender on Facebook ads by any presidential candidate, is also running the most ads about impeachment, launching at least 1,900 in the week through Monday that mention \u201cimpeach\u201d or \u201cimpeachment.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign has used the inquiry, which he has assailed as a fraud and hoax, to ramp up a fundraising blitz. The campaign said it raised $15 million in 72 hours after Pelosi\u2019s impeachment inquiry announcement.\n\n\u201cEvery time Democrats think they\u2019ve got something to take President Trump down, it just makes him and his campaign bigger, badder, and better than before,\u201d said Erin Perrine, a Trump campaign spokeswoman.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s Facebook ads ask voters to donate to the \u2018Official Impeachment Defense Fund.\u2019 They describe the impeachment effort as a Democratic plan to steal next year\u2019s election, or as a product of an \u201cunhinged socialist mob\u201d that includes Pelosi and Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is in full panic mode and his campaign is being forced to spend millions of dollars on impeachment,\u201d said Kevin Mack, lead strategist of Need to Impeach, the super PAC (political action group) founded by billionaire Democratic candidate Tom Steyer.\n\nThe group on Tuesday announced a roughly $3 million push in TV and digital ads targeting Senate Republicans over impeachment.", "description": "U.S. Senator Kamala Harris is funding the most new Facebook ads calling for President Donald Trump's impeachment among the 19 Democrats seeking their party's nomination to face the Republican president in the November 2020 election, a Reuters review of Facebook ad data shows.", "authors": ["Jason Lange", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436413803&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911XA"}
