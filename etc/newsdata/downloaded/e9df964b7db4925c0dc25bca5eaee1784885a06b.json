Political ads will be labelled as such.\n\nPosts reported by Facebook\u2019s U.K. fact-checking partner Full Fact found to contain fake news will be labelled as being false.\n\nBut with an election in the U.K. likely soon, Collins questioned the \u201cfocus on a decision by the platform to drop a ban on political advertising that have \u2018deceptive, false or misleading content\u2019 and instead only banning ads that \u2018include claims debunked by third-party fact-checkers.\u2019\u201d\n\nCollins and his influential British parliamentary committee have urged the government to bring forward new laws addressing campaigning techniques in the digital age, insisting that democracy itself is under threat without speedy action.\n\nThe work has heaped pressure on social media companies, which have faced global scrutiny following allegations that political consultant Cambridge Analytica used data from tens of millions of Facebook accounts to profile voters and help U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign.\n\nAllan\u2019s comments came as Facebook announced plans Monday in the United States to step up its efforts to ensure it is not used as a tool to interfere in politics and democracies globally. The company said it will also label state-controlled media as such, label fact-checks more clearly and invest $2 million in media literacy projects.\n\nThe company said it has removed four networks of fake, state-backed misinformation-spreading accounts based in Russia and Iran. These networks sought to disrupt elections in the U.S., North Africa and Latin America.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An influential British lawmaker challenged Facebook's new effort to safeguard elections on Tuesday, warning that they will place a heavy constraint on the company's ability to combat misinformation.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Danica Kirka"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/facebook_politics_18097_c0-171-4115-2571_s1200x700.jpg?9edda7c976e322eb421ca6ff91d02ed6aa38b808", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
