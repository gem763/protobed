That's according to psychologist Perpetua Neo, who believes success comes out of the attempts we make. As for those who don't fail at all, they're not living hard enough.\n\n\"Everybody has got failures,\" Neo told Insider. \"If you see people with success, you're looking at their shiny front. We don't see how many failures it took for them to be like that.\"\n\nA talented tailor, for example, can alter clothes perfectly in no time at all. But they don't reach that level of skill overnight \u2014 there's a lot of training, practice, and most importantly, failure.\n\n\"There's a lot we don't see,\" Neo said. \"If you look at your own life, what are the things you've bounced back from?\"\n\nIf you look at the person you are today, she said, what would you tell your younger self if you could?\n\n\"What would they be proud of? What demons are they proud of you for conquering? How have you grown as a person?\" she said. \"I think that's something we don't celebrate or champion enough.\"\n\nRead more: The unexpected negative impact being a digital nomad can have on your mental health\n\nReal wisdom comes from experience, not just \"hiding behind a book,\" according to Neo.\n\n\"I want to know you know what it's like to be human,\" she said. \"Because it's very easy to say just do x, y, z. But to actually know what it's like to push yourself through something, in your darkest times, and the times you're unmotivated, is another thing altogether.\"\n\nUnder the #failure hashtag on Instagram, there are nearly 1.5 million posts. Many of them include motivational quotes from unarguably successful people like Bill Gates, Michael Jordan, and John D. Rockefeller.\n\n\"I failed my way to success,\" says one by Thomas Edison.\n\nPeople who repress their vulnerabilities and their failures tend to be the ones who are the most unpalatable, said Neo, because they believe showing them makes them weak.\n\n\"They are the people who can be the most cruel,\" she said. \"When you can own the different chapters of your life, even if initially you feel a little embarrassed, the more integrated you are as a human being and the more authentic you are.\"\n\nLearning to embrace failure makes you more comfortable with yourself.\n\nEveryone has things they are not good at and has made decisions in the past they are not proud of. But if we push them down and pretend they don't exist, it can build this resentment inside of us, Neo said.\n\nThere are two things you can do to learn to embrace your failures, and in turn, attempt more in your life.\n\n1. Accept who you are\n\n\"It's a question of 'do you really want to make the effort?'\" Neo said. \"If not, then just accept you need help or you're just crap at something.\"\n\nThere's no shame in saying you're bad at directions or have no creative talent whatsoever. But if we dwell on it, and see it as a shameful thing, then we beat ourselves up over it.\n\n\"The person you see who seems to have a perfect life, maybe they do, or maybe they're just great at certain things and crap at other things like you,\" said Neo. \"Just like you have natural strengths and you have skills you've picked up the hard way.\"\n\n2. Accept what you need to work on\n\nYour life isn't going to end because you can't park a car. But if failing at it over and over again is causing you anguish, then do something about it, Neo said.\n\n\"Either you learn how to or you don't,\" she said.\n\nRBFried / Getty\n\nFailure teaches you what to simplify in your life.\n\nAccording to Neo, when we fail at something, it can be a simple indication it's something that doesn't work for you and you can cut it loose.\n\n\"When you want to pick up something or work towards a goal, sometimes we get caught up in the nitty-gritty, and we buy 10,000 programs and courses online and do everything.,\" she said. \"But think of it as evolution. It's not just about becoming more complex, it's also in terms of simplifying a system. It's basically refining a process.\"\n\nEssentially, failure is a form of intel. It tells you what you're good at, and what you're not so good at.\n\nThe real strength comes in realizing \"everything is a lesson\" \u2014 taking the result you got from the test, analyzing it, and working out what you're going to do about it.\n\n\"We carry our perceived and real failures and over-think it in our heads, so there's a lot of anger, and forgiveness allows us to let it go,\" said Neo. \"If you can release that, you can truly forgive yourself and know that the inadequacy doesn't own you anymore.\"\n\nRead more: 13 things you shouldn't say to someone who is struggling with their mental health", "description": "By learning to embrace failure instead of being scared of it, we stop beating ourselves up all the time, according to psychologist Perpetua Neo.", "authors": ["Lindsay Dodgson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d726ca7f4fc24446e267255-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
