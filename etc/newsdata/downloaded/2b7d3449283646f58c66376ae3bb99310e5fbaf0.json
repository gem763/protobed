It\u2019s difficult to get a clinically significant dose of curcumin by having the occasional curry for dinner, but adding turmeric to your daily routine in the form of this delicious golden milk won\u2019t hurt anyone and helps soothe and relax you for bed time. It\u2019s delicious, and the fat from the coconut oil and the black pepper help you better absorb the curcumin in your cup.
