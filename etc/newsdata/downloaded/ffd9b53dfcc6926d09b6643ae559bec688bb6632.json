Bertelsman threw out Nicholas Sandmann's $250 million claim in July against the Post following its coverage of protests between two separate groups in Washington, D.C. Now he has restored significant portions of Sandmann's legal claim.\n\n'A Federal Judge is allowing the Nick Sandman libel suit to move forward against the thoroughly disgusting Washington Post,' Trump tweeted, noting that he has recently discontinued the White House's subscription to the storied newspaper.\n\n'He could now have a good chance of winning. Go Nick!' the president added.\n\nThe teenager, a student at Covington Catholic High School,in Park Hills, Kentucky, claimed the Post and other news outlets falseley labeled him a racist after the encounter with a Native American man at the Lincoln Memorial in January.\n\nCovington students participated in the annual anti-abortion March for Life in January, which coincided with an 'Indigenous Peoples March.' An image of Sandmann and American Indian leader Nathan Phillips, in which a MAGA hat-wearing Sandmann grinned through a statre-down with a drumming and singing Phillips, quickly went viral.\n\nA federal judge dismissed Covington Catholic student Nicholas Sandmann's $250 million libel lawsuit against the Washington Post, stemming from an incident (pictured) which went viral \u2013 but later revived significant parts of the legal action\n\nPresident Donald Trump openly rooted for the teen in a tweet because he hates the 'thoroughly disgusting' Post\n\nTrump has a long-running feud with the Post, which is now owned by Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos\n\nBoth Sandmann and Phillips say they were trying to defuse tensions rising among three groups marching on the same day. An organization of black 'Hebrew Israelites' demonstrating nearby added to the confusion.\n\nThe Post and other outlets characterized Sandmann as a smug racist who initiated a physical confrontation. Video footage later debunked that initial interpretation.\n\nThe legal complaint claimed that the Post 'ignored basic journalist standards because it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented, biased agenda against President Donald J. Trump ... by impugning individuals perceived to be supporters.'\n\nThe Post reported that Sandmann and other schoolboys had 'surrounded' and 'taunted' the 64-year-old Phillips, and claimed that a 'smirking' Sandmann had stood in Phillip's path, blocking him from moving.\n\nIn a subsequent editor's note, the paper conceded that its own reporting had allowed 'a more complete assessment of what occurred, either contradicting or failing to confirm accounts provided in that story \u2014 including that Native American activist Nathan Phillips was prevented by one student from moving on, that his group had been taunted by the students in the lead-up to the encounter, and that the students were trying to instigate a conflict.'\n\nBertelsman dismissed Sandmann's case in July, ruling that the Post's initial articles about the event were protected by the First Amendment.\n\nBut his 180-degree turn will give the boy's lawyers to access to emails and other documents the Post has in a fresh legal discovery process.\n\nSandmann's lawsuit claimed that the newspaper engaged in 'targeting and bullying' and modern 'McCarthyism' in its coverage of the January incident\n\nSandmann (center) is seen above appearing to confront Native American activist Nathan Phillips (in tan jacket) during a rally in Washington\n\nThe eight boys listed anonymously as plaintiffs in the complaint, which was filed in Kentucky's Kenton County Circuit Court, claim the named defendants, who are all prominent figures on Twitter, falsely smeared them as bigots and damaged their lives and reputations in the process\n\nSandmann's attorneys had also threatened legal action against The Associated Press and other news organizations, and filed multimillion dollar lawsuits against the networks CNN and NBC.\n\nLawyer Todd McMurtry said that the 'ruling bodes well' for those cases.\n\n'This is a huge win,' he tweeded. 'Now #NickSandmann will be able to start discovery and find out exactly what the reporters were thinking when they attacked Nicholas and the #CovingtonCatholic kids.'\n\nA federal judge previously ruled Nicholas Sandmann's $250 million lawsuit against the Washington Post was meritless because the paper quoted Nathan Phillips (pictured) who gave his opinion on what happened that day\n\nThe actions of Sandmann and his classmates during the January march were intensely debated after the video and photographs emerged of them wearing 'Make America Great Again' hats near Phillips as he played a drum.\n\nFootage later emerged showing that both groups had been targeted by separate protesters and that Phillips had approached the Catholic students to talk with them.\n\nSandmann launched a defamation suit against the Post, which is owned by Amazon's Jeff Bezos in February, alleging it had engaged in 'targeting and bullying' and modern 'McCarthyism' in order to further an 'anti-Trump agenda'.\n\nPresident Donald Trump himself cheered the lawsuit, posting to Twitter that 'Covington student suing WAPO. Go get them Nick. Fake News!'\n\nBertelsman's 36-page judgement read: 'Few principles of law are as well-established as the rule that statements of opinion are not actionable in libel actions.'\n\nVideo footage later revealed Sandmann had been approached by Phillips (right, file image), and not the other way around\n\nLess than a week after Bertelsman's ruling a fresh suit was filed in Kentucky's Kenton County Circuit Court accusing a host of news organizations, journalists and celebrities of defamation.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman and CNN pundit Ana Navarro were among 12 defendants named in the separate suit, which seeks a maximum payout of $600,000 ($50,000 per defendant).\n\nFederal judge William O. Bertelsman ruled in July that the Washington Post's reporting was protected by the First Amendment. On Monday he partially reopened the case\n\nActivist Shaun King, US Rep. Deb Haaland, comedian Kathy Griffin and Princeton Universit8y historian Kevin Kruse were also named in the suit along with ABC News political analyst Matthew Dowd, Mother Jones Editor-in-Chief Clara Jefferey, Rewire Editor-in-Chief Jodi Jacobson, Kentucky entrepreneur Adam Edelen and former CNN correspondent Reza Aslan.\n\nEight male students listed anonymously as plaintiffs in the complaint, claim the named defendants, who are all prominent figures on Twitter, falsely smeared them as bigots and damaged their lives and reputations.\n\nIn a letter to the Associated Press in February, attorney L. Lin Wood called on the AP to 'retract and correct' what his letter asserts are 'defamatory statements.'\n\nA spokeswoman said at the time that the AP took great care to ensure its stories were measured and fair, reporting the facts of what transpired and adding details as they emerged.\n\nWood did not reply to an email message seeking comment on the ruling in July.\n\nIn Sandmann's lawsuit against The Washington Post, his attorneys highlighted seven articles and three Twitter social media posts they considered defamatory to Sandmann.\n\n'The Post ignored basic journalist standards because it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented, biased agenda against President Donald J. Trump ... by impugning individuals perceived to be supporters,' according to the complaint.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that the newspaper had 'conveyed that [Sandmann] engaged in acts of racism by 'swarming' Phillips, 'blocking' his exit away from the students, and otherwise engaging in racist misconduct.'\n\nJudge Bertelsman said in the ruling that he accepted Sandmann's contention that 'when he was standing motionless in the confrontation with Phillips, his intent was to calm the situation...'\n\nBut he noted that Phillips asserted that he was being blocked from passing, and Phillips' opinion was reported by the newspaper.\n\n'They may have been erroneous ... but they are opinion protected by The First Amendment,' Bertelsman wrote.\n\nIn a statement to the Washington Post not long after the ruling, Sandmann's parents indicated their intention to appeal.\n\n'I believe fighting for justice for my son and family is of vital national importance,' Ted Sandmann said in a statement. 'If what was done to Nicholas is not legally actionable, then no one is safe.'", "description": "Donald Trump backed a conservative Kentucky high school student in his legal battle against the Post, after a judge revived a high-profile lawsuit accusing the newspaper of defaming him.", "authors": ["David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor", "Chris Dyer For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/13/20376174-0-image-a-4_1572441713533.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
