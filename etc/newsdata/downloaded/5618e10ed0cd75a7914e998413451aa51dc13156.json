Trump took the action after a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, stunning Pentagon officials.\n\n\u201cThis is just insane,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThe Kurds have been essential in America\u2019s fight against ISIS.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s decision has \u201cnow put America\u2019s Kurdish allies in danger,\u201d said Noah. \u201cAfter a move like this, you can\u2019t blame America\u2019s allies for thinking America\u2019s word ain\u2019t shit.\u201d\n\nWith the Syrian Kurds now at risk, ISIS \u201ccould make a comeback,\u201d he warned.\n\nIt was a \u201cSyrious\u201d message from Noah.
