In the face of the enemy, a bungled withdrawal becomes a retreat, and a retreat can become a rout.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration announced it was pulling troops from the border area between Turkey and Syria. Just days later, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the military would launch an offensive into northeastern Syria, aimed at Kurdish forces, which were left vulnerable with US troops withdrawn.\n\nWesley K. Clark\n\nWith this latest US pullback, the United States' strategic withdrawal from the Mideast looks like an open door to regional disaster -- or worse, to a wholesale loss of American influence, perhaps worldwide. The US Senate, and especially the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, owes it to the men and women in uniform, and those who have previously served, to hold the hearings that will make sense of this strategy, or help develop a better approach.\n\nThese hearings should be asking the fundamental questions: Why was the withdrawal ordered with apparently no military preparation? Why was there no effort to resolve Erdogan's boiling ambitions in Syria through diplomacy and mediation? With US troops withdrawn, what is the strategy for maintaining our ability to secure US interests in the region? And what are the implications for US alliances worldwide -- and the safety and security of our military and their families serving around the globe?\n\nBased on what we know so far, the withdrawal order emerged from a presidential phone call with Erdogan, and called for immediate pullback from the border. This involved only about 50 troops.", "description": "Wesley Clark writes that there should be a Senate hearing to determine why President Trump ordered the removal of US troops from Syria.
