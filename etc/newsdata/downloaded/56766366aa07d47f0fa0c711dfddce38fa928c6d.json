During the health care contretemps she lamented that \u201cnot once have we talked about Donald Trump.\u201d And when she made the case for using executive action to overcome legislative gridlock, she turned to Mr. Biden, let out a laugh and borrowed Mr. Obama\u2019s signature line. \u201cHey, Joe, let\u2019s say, \u2018Yes we can,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Harris\u2019s attempt at a strategic makeover was hard to miss, but other candidates also tried to show voters a fuller version of themselves. Ms. Warren stayed true to her vision for sweeping policy proposals, but she also used the debate, held in the city where she went to college, to talk more about her personal story, which many voters are only dimly aware of. She recalled her Oklahoma youth, repeatedly cited her brothers\u2019 military service and talked about being a public school teacher.\n\nIf Ms. Warren seemed determined to unfurl her biography, Mr. Sanders came prepared to take on Mr. Biden. The Vermont senator was assertive about drawing contrasts between his progressive credentials and Mr. Biden\u2019s far more varied record. Where Mr. Sanders shied away from direct conflict when he shared a debate stage with Mr. Biden in June, this time he sought out areas of sharp disagreement, including over the NAFTA trade deal and the war in Iraq. Mr. Biden supported both; Mr. Sanders opposed them.\n\n[We fact-checked what the candidates said at the Democratic debate.]\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s lively, sometimes heated internal disagreements were on vivid display throughout the night, on subjects as diverse as gun control, trade with China, the war in Afghanistan and the Senate filibuster. And if the clearest philosophical gulf separated Mr. Biden from the prominent populists who flanked him \u2014 Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren \u2014 the debate made plain that the party was in the midst of a far more complex process of defining its identity.\n\nThe remaining field of candidates arrayed themselves around the same philosophical dividing line, most of them aligning more closely with Mr. Biden. And for the first time in this primary race, a few of the trailing contenders sharpened their attacks.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota derided Mr. Sanders\u2019s single-payer health care bill as a \u201cbad idea,\u201d while Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., accused Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren of seeking to take away choice from consumers.\n\n\u201cI trust the American people to make the right choice for them,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d", "description": "The Democratic front-runner repeatedly invoked President Barack Obama\u2019s name, while some of his rivals said the party needed to move well beyond the policies of the last Democratic president.", "authors": ["Jonathan Martin", "Alexander Burns"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/14/us/politics/12debate-ledeall-top-new/12debate-ledeall-top-new-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
