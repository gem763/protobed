USA TODAY\n\nATLANTA \u2014 It has been an admittedly frustrating season for the Atlanta Falcons, so it\u2019s no surprise that running back Devonta Freeman wanted to punch someone in the midst of another poor performance Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nOf course, when the person you\u2019re trying to punch is 6-foot-1, 280-pound defensive tackle Aaron Donald, turning the other cheek might have been a smarter move.\n\nFreeman and Donald got tangled up after Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan threw an interception early in the third quarter in altercation that briefly cleared both sidelines and resulted in Freeman\u2019s disqualification before things settled down.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly why Freeman, who stands at 5-foot-8 and 206 pounds, took exception to Donald in the aftermath of the play. But after the ball caromed off the hands of receiver Mohamed Sanu and was snagged off the shoestrings by linebacker Cory Littleton, Freeman directly engaged Donald by putting both hands on his facemask.\n\nDonald responded by literally lifting Freeman off the ground by his shoulder pads, and when Freeman cocked his fist back to throw the punch, he didn\u2019t have much leverage to connect.\n\nThe referee quickly got in the middle of the fracas before Freeman could do any more damage \u2014 more likely to himself than Donald \u2014 while both teams engaged each other on the field.\n\nAs Freeman left the field, Donald was seen visibly laughing on the Rams\u2019 bench as they led 21-3.", "description": "Falcons running back Devonta Freeman took out his frustrations on Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald on Sunday and was subsequently ejected.", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published P.M.
