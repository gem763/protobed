The iconic Oscar-winning filmmaker, who has directed movies including Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and The Departed among others, is receiving all the praises for his upcoming movie The Irishman as well. However, his recent remark about Marvel movies has put him under the scanner.\n\nWhen he was recently asked about Marvel movies, which the world is obsessing over, he said, \u201cI tried, you know? But that\u2019s not cinema.\u201d\n\nTwitter\n\n\u201cHonestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being,\u201d he told The Empire magazine as quoted by theguardian.com.\n\nscreengeek.net\n\nHis views didn\u2019t go down well with MCU fans, which are massive in number globally. He, obviously, received a lot of flak too.\n\nTake: the Scorsese take is #dumb and #stupid and pretentious gate-keeping. By definition, \"cinema\" means... a movie or film. The MCU is made up of 23 (and counting) movies. Therefore, MCU movies are cinema because all moves are cinema. That's how logic works.\n\n*runs* \u2014 Sagar Trika (@BlazersBySagar) October 4, 2019\n\nDon't Miss 192 SHARES 630 SHARES 217 SHARES 255 SHARES 4.2 K SHARES\n\nTake: the Scorsese take is #dumb and #stupid and pretentious gate-keeping.

But it wasn\u2019t \u201cstanding on a stage talking to an empty chair\u201d dumb.\n\nSo let grandpa be cranky about the damn kids with their Thor hair and their Guardians music. It\u2019s harmless. \u2014 Salome Strangelove (@salstrange) October 4, 2019\n\n...I don't care how Legendary or Iconic Scorsese is. He's coming off bitter as it pertains to Marvel and Superhero Films.\n\nWhen you're on top, people are always going to say dumb sh*t \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nSit ya bitter ass down... pic.twitter.com/2ABCxjfTtl \u2014 Calio Williamson (@CalioWilliamson) October 4, 2019\n\nWe need to remember that cinema is both entertainment as well as thought provoking. Scorsese prefers movies his way and that's not totally wrong. Still, I am a Marvel fan, so I did think he was a bit harsh with his explanation \u2014 StheGeneral (@general_sthe) October 4, 2019\n\nHi, Martin Scorsese is wrong. Marvel movies are cinema whether you like them or not. pic.twitter.com/fepctCEXyO \u2014 Dubside Productions (@DubsideP) October 4, 2019\n\nGuardian of the Galaxy director James Gunn also didn\u2019t quite like his comments. \u201cMartin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers. I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I\u2019m saddened that he\u2019s now judging my films in the same way,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nMartin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers.

Jackson also clapped back at Martin Scorsese\u2019s comments.\n\n\"I mean that's like saying Bugs Bunny ain't funny. Films are films. Everybody doesn't like his stuff either. I mean, we happen to, but everybody doesn't,\" Jackson was quoted as saying by Variety.\n\n\"Everybody's got an opinion, so I mean it's okay. Ain't going to stop nobody from making movies,\" Jackson added.\n\nAvengers writer-director Joss Whedon also shared his opinion.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u201d\n\nI first think of @JamesGunn, how his heart & guts are packed into GOTG. I revere Marty, & I do see his point, but...\n\nWell there\u2019s a reason why \u201cI\u2019m always angry\u201d. https://t.co/Wh3ptU2KBp \u2014 Joss Whedon (@joss) October 4, 2019\n\nC. Robert Cargill, who wrote the screenplay for 'Doctor Strange', called Scorsese a \"genius,\" but said, \"anyone who thinks Marvel is only trying to make theme park rides is being unjust and cynical.\"\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Marvel movies have been criticised. Celebs including director James Cameron have criticised Marvel films in the past as well.", "description": "Clearly, Martin Scorsese is not a fan of Marvel movies.
