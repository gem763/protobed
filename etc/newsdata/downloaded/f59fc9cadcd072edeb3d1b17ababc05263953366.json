The new feature means that Hulu is finally adding a convenience that both Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have offered for quite some time now. Downloads are launching on iOS and iPadOS today, with Android to follow \u201csoon.\u201d\n\nBut there are caveats.\n\nThe most important one is that, right now, offline downloads are available exclusively to customers on Hulu\u2019s No Ads plan. This step-up plan costs $11.99 compared to the service\u2019s base $5.99-per-month subscription. So immediately, a whole lot of Hulu subscribers won\u2019t have access to this feature. Ouch, yes. But it makes sense for Hulu\u2019s business model and creates more incentive to opt for the pricier plan if eliminating ads wasn\u2019t enough for you.\n\nSecond, there are somewhat strict restrictions on your timeframe for actually watching the stuff you download.\n\nViewers can download up to 25 titles across 5 different devices and will have up to 30 days to watch their downloaded content. For watched content, the download will expire two days after starting playback. After downloaded content expires, viewers can renew an expired download when online, if that content is still available on Hulu.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing too annoying, but you\u2019ll definitely want to stay mindful of that two-day window after you hit play on something. It might be best to wait until you\u2019re sure you\u2019ll make it through that show or movie before the download expires.\n\nHulu says it has \u201cthousands\u201d of titles (between TV shows and movies) that are eligible to be downloaded, but you definitely can\u2019t grab anything and everything that\u2019s on the service. To find content that allows offline downloading, you can tap the new downloads icon in the Hulu app and then pick \u201csee what\u2019s downloadable.\u201d You\u2019ll also see a download icon appear in search results for shows and movies that support offline viewing. Hulu\u2019s original hits like The Handmaid\u2019s Tale are eligible for downloads.\n\nDownloads have been in the works at Hulu for a long time, and the company\u2019s various deals with networks and content owners no doubt made the process a little complicated. But it\u2019s now table stakes, with Disney+ planning to offer the convenience at launch next month.", "description": "Offline downloads are now available from Hulu, letting subscribers save content for later viewing when they\u2019re away from a Wi-Fi connection.
