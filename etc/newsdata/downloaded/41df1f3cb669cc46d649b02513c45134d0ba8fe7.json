Share the wealth\n\nI've always believed that happiness comes from helping others. If I were a millionaire, instead of shopping for more stuff I probably don't need, I would continue to live my current lifestyle. I wouldn't spend any extra money on myself. I'd rather share my wealth with other people.\n\nVanessa Sin, 17, Li Po Chun United World College\n\n2. Mind the gap\n\nIt is ridiculous that one in every 38 Hongkongers is a US dollar millionaire when one in five lives in poverty. If I were a millionaire, I wouldn't be able to bear it. Instead, I'd spend my money helping to narrow the city's wealth gap.\n\nAnnette Kim Na-yeon, 15, Chinese International School\n\n3. A meaningful life\n\nIf I were a millionaire, my lifestyle wouldn't change. I would still go to work, although I wouldn't have to worry about money. I would also spend time with my family and hang out with friends. I'd work hard to enjoy a meaningful life and continue to contribute to society.\n\nCharlotte Chan, 15, German Swiss International School\n\n4. Helping others\n\nIn short, my life would become a lot easier. But other than buying a big house and flashy car, I would try my best to help the less fortunate. It has always been something I've loved to do, and no amount of money is going to change that.\n\nTayyab Shahzada, 15, Sha Tin College\n\n5. Expensive ice cream\n\nThe best thing about being a millionaire is that you don't have to worry about the price of things. Instead, you could focus on quality and personal choice. I'd be able to buy my favourite type of ice cream without ever worrying about the price.\n\nSophia Zhang, 10, Sha Tin Junior School\n\n6.Living in a Korean drama\n\nMy life would definitely be way more luxurious than it is at the moment. But one downside is how hard it would be to trust others, in case they were plotting to steal my fortune. It would be like living in a cheesy Korean drama.\n\nHelen Wong, 15, Sha Tin College\n\n7. Knowledge is power\n\nIf I were a millionaire, I would buy loads of books to read. I'd also take as many extra lessons as I could, because knowledge is power! I wouldn't spend too much of my money on luxury items, but I'd probably travel around in an air-conditioned limousine.\n\nJacqueline Chan, 16, Marymount Secondary School\n\n8. Rolling in a Rolls\n\nNeedless to say, my life would change drastically if I were a millionaire. I wouldn't have to scrabble in my wallet for that extra 50 cents for the minibus ever again - I'd just roll in a Rolls!\n\nAnirudh Kannan, 14, South Island School\n\n9. Private paradise\n\nPrivate plane, private beach, private cruise \u2026 all things private! Living in a crowded, bustling city like Hong Kong can be all too overwhelming. But if I were a millionaire, I'd escape to a peaceful place and enjoy my own company. That would be my paradise.\n\nCammy Lam Sze-ning, 17, SKH Chan Young Secondary School\n\n10. Lord of the money\n\nIf I were a millionaire, I would buy 100 hectares in New Zealand and a lot of Lord of the Rings merchandise. I would then live there like a hobbit for a year - or maybe forever.\n\nMay Huang, 17, Chinese International School", "description": "One in every 38 Hongkongers is a US dollar millionaire, one of the highest rates in the world.
