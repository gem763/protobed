But he is not so sure that applies to American sports executives commenting on political issues in other countries.\n\nKhan was asked on stage at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit in New York on Thursday what the NBA should do about its current political crisis in China, after Houston Rockets G.M. Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protesters, angering the NBA\u2019s business partners in China.\n\n\u201cAs an American investor/owner, I went through something very similar in Catalan, Spain,\u201d Khan said, referencing the Catalan independence movement that reached a boiling point in 2017. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t think, as an American, I should really be having an opinion on it, even though a lot of people wanted us to. I want to have an opinion in America, there\u2019s a civic duty to engage and do the right thing, but having an opinion on sovereign matters in other countries, it\u2019s for those people to decide.\u201d (Flex-N-Gate has seven plants in Spain, four of them in Catalonia.)\n\nApplying his point specifically to China, Khan made his view more clear: \u201cI have a factory in China,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there are thousands of other people who have factories and operations in China, and they do very well. But you have to respect the norms.\u201d\n\nHighlight: \"What should the [NBA] be doing?\" @readdanwrite asks amid the NBA-China controversy. \"That's for the NBA commissioner to do,\" @Jaguars owner Shad Khan says, adding: \"You have to respect the norms.\" Watch more here: https://t.co/xpAujlCWBd #YahooAMS pic.twitter.com/5c9l5DlYiL \u2014 Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) October 10, 2019\n\nKhan used the same general point to discuss the Colin Kaepernick-led player protests in the NFL from two years ago.\n\n\u201cI think players, and every human being, has a right to speak what their opinion is,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no issue as far as that goes, whether it\u2019s NFL or anybody else. We are American citizens, we have a social, civic responsibility to be active in causes we believe in. But do we have that same responsibility to opine on sovereign matters in other countries? That\u2019s the critical issue.\u201d\n\nJacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan prior to the International Series NFL match at Wembley Stadium, London.

And the NFL, it is no secret, seeks to do the same.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re a sports team or you\u2019re an auto parts factory, a key tenet of why you exist is to do good,\u201d Khan said. \u201cAnd we are active, obviously, in every market we are in, but looking, really, for areas that are non-controversial or non-divisive. So what does that mean? For a football club like the Jaguars in London, or Fulham, we focus on youth health, for example, youth education, and programs for the less fortunate\u2026 non-controversial, where everybody really supports those initiatives. That\u2019s been our approach.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nDaniel Roberts is the sports business writer at Yahoo Finance.
