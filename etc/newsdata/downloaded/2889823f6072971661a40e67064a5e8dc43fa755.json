This week, when Mexican and American officials met in Washington to discuss progress on the issue, the Mexican delegation took great pains to show how its crackdown along its border with Guatemala and throughout the country has reduced migration flows to the United States by more than 50 percent in the last three months.\n\nMexico\u2019s actions, though applauded by Trump administration officials this week, have overwhelmed its troubled migration system. The number of individuals applying for asylum in Mexico has already skyrocketed in the last few years, as the United States has tightened its borders.\n\nThis rule could add to that burden, with many more applying for asylum in Mexico, despite the danger of remaining in Mexico. Violence there has soared to the highest levels in more than two decades. Stories of migrants kidnapped along the border abound, as criminal organizations await their return from the United States or pick them off as they attempt to cross the border.\n\nSeveral migrants who are making their way north said in interviews on Thursday that the new rule would not deter them. For most, the hope of a new life in the United States outweighed whatever legal worries might lie ahead.\n\n\u201cI know things are getting more and more complicated in the U.S.,\u201d said Noel Hern\u00e1ndez, 21, who was staying at a migrant shelter in Guatemala after leaving his home in Tegucigalpa, in Honduras, a few days ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like flipping a coin,\u201d he said. \u201cI either win or I lose.\u201d\n\nOthers said they would try to make it in Mexico, despite the violence, or in Guatemala, a nation with a barely functional asylum system.", "description": "The new rule will likely place many more migrants in danger as they debate whether to remain in Mexico as asylum seekers, try their luck in an increasingly hostile United States or return home.", "authors": ["Azam Ahmed", "Paulina Villegas"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/world/12Mexico-1/12Mexico-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
