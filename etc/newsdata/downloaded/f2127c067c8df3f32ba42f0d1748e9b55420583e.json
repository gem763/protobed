UltraViolet co-founder Shaunna Thomas was front and center, blasting NBC for allegedly failing \u201cto hold sexual abusers accountable\u201d and failing to \u201ccombat a toxic culture across newsrooms.\u201d\n\nNBC NEWS REPORTEDLY RENEWS NOAH OPPENHEIM\u2019S CONTRACT, DRAWING OUTRAGE: 'STATUS QUO HAS BEEN BLESSED'\n\nThe group called for NBCUniversal to fire NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC president Phil Griffin and \u201cevery other person in leadership that enabled abusers and silenced survivors\u201d at the Peacock Network.\n\n\u201cIt's not just a Matt Lauer problem. It's a company-wide problem. And it's one that Comcast NBC needs to take seriously and demonstrate that they're taking seriously,\u201d Thomas said outside NBC\u2019s famed 30 Rock.\n\nUltraViolet also demanded that the embattled network release all \u201csurvivors from non-disclosure agreements,\u201d \u201cend the practice of pre-dispute arbitration for sexual abuse claims\u201d and commission an independent internal investigation into company culture.\n\nNBC NEWS BOSS ACCUSED OF 'OUTRAGEOUS AND BORDERLINE GRAFT' IN USING 'TODAY' TO FATTEN WALLET\n\nThe group swarmed NBC\u2019s headquarters and chanted in the lobby.\n\n\"Where oh where is NBC? Come on down and speak to me,\u201d the women chanted until a building staffer accepted a petition with nearly 20,000 signatures and promised to get it into the hands of NBC management.\n\nNBC News and NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS\n\nOppenheim \u2013 who reportedly recently received a new contract -- has been widely criticized for his role in the handling of the Weinstein and Lauer sexual harassment scandals. Oppenheim is painted as a key figure in NBC\u2019s decision not to run Ronan Farrow\u2019s award-winning report that exposed Weinstein as a sexual predator throughout his book \u201cCatch and Kill.\u201d\n\nOppenheim famously told Farrow that his Weinstein reporting wasn\u2019t fit to print, so Farrow took it to The New Yorker, where it won the Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement.\n\nFarrow\u2019s book details his version of why NBC refused to expose Weinstein \u2013 which includes allegations that the disgraced movie mogul leveraged the knowledge of Lauer\u2019s own misconduct.\n\n\u2018TODAY\u2019 ADDRESSES \u2018APPALLING\u2019 NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT\u2019S JUST VERY PAINFUL'\n\n\u201cThe fact that Comcast was renewing Noah Oppenheimer's contract while being aware of and knowing that these allegations were coming forward....I think demonstrates that this problem goes right to the top. And that's the parent company, Comcast,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nFarrow\u2019s book also reported that MSNBC\u2019s president, Griffin, once shared a revealing image of TV host Maria Menounos during a staff meeting \u2013 which irked one particular protestor.\n\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED\n\n\u201cI am a huge fan of MSNBC and when I read what this guy did, I could not believe it. He showed a woman's private part at a meeting. You don't do that to anybody,\u201d a protestor told Fox News.\n\nAfter the Weinstein and Lauer bombshells were reported in 2017, NBC refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct and whether NBC executives looked the other way. NBC relied on in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an outside law firm to conduct the review.\n\nRONAN FARROW FIRES BACK AT NBC NEWS BOSS WHO HAS \u2018THE MOST TO LOSE FROM THE TRUTH\u2019\n\nNBC eventually declared that management was completely oblivious to Lauer\u2019s behavior and Harris\u2019 high-powered colleagues were cleared by the network \u2013 but UltraViolet has vowed not to give up until an independent investigation is launched.\n\n\u201cThere is a structural problem with sexual harassment and covering up sexual harassment in a culture that permits that kind of behavior to go on inside this company,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe would expect that NBC would be a place where it would be safe for women to work and to be able to have their voices heard. And that's not the case. And that's why we're here.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nAnother protestor told Fox News that \u201cNBC is particularly guilty of it and refuses to really take any responsibility\u201d for its wrongdoings, while others expressed displeasure that the liberal MSNBC was involved.\n\n\u201cYou know, MSNBC is like far left, you know, so those of us who believe in progressive politics, we pay a lot of attention. We listen to them. We watch them. And now to hear that all of this stuff is coming out about how they're suppressing women's voices,\u201d a protestor said.", "description": "Protestors rallied outside NBC News headquarters in New York City on Tuesday, demanding that NBCUniversal takes immediate action against alleged abuses of power amid ongoing scandals related to Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
