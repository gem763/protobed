Habibie, who came to power as the world\u2019s fourth largest nation endured a turbulent transition to democracy after former strongman Suharto stepped down in 1998.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Former Indonesian president B. J. Habibie waves as he arrives for a ceremony to officially open the new Australian embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia March 21, 2016. REUTERS/Garry Lotulung\n\nThe 83-year-old Habibie had been suffering heart failure, his son Tariq Kemal Habibie told Metro TV late on Wednesday.\n\nPeople lined the streets as the cortege drove through central Jakarta for the state funeral at the Kalibata Heroes Memorial Park, where President Joko Widodo was set to lead the ceremony.\n\nAn engineer by training, Habibie succeeded Suharto as Indonesia\u2019s third president only months after becoming his deputy, just as the country sank into a spasms of rioting and economic upheaval following the Asian financial crisis.\n\nTaking over from Suharto, who had ruled the world\u2019s most populous Muslim majority country with an iron fist for 32 years, Habibie held power for just 17 months.\n\nIt fell to Habibie to oversee unpopular economic reforms prescribed by the International Monetary Fund at the height of the financial crisis, that were needed to bring inflation down from more than 80% and stabilize a rupiah currency after its value had crashed.\n\nThough he was a product of Suharto\u2019s \u201cNew Order\u201d administration, which gave a strong political role to the military and stifled opponents, Habibie oversaw democratic reforms to free political prisoners and allow press freedom.\n\nIn an abrupt change to longheld policy, he also agreed to a referendum for the people of former Portuguese colony East Timor, which had been annexed in 1976 following an invasion by Indonesian troops in December 1975. The referendum in 1999 resulted in a vote for independence and unleashed a wave of violence.\n\nHabibie also eased discriminatory policies against Indonesia\u2019s ethnic Chinese minority, including allowing the speaking and teaching of Mandarin and use of Chinese names that was previously discouraged by Suharto.\n\nHabibie was also known for his quest to turn Indonesia into a technological powerhouse, including trying to develop a national aircraft industry.\n\nSpeaking at the hospital shortly after Habibie passed away, President Widodo described him as \u201cthe father of technology in Indonesia\u201d.\n\nMahathir Mohamad, prime minister of neighboring Malaysia, posted his condolences on Twitter and said the death of Habibie was a \u201cbig loss\u201d.\n\nBut for many ordinary people, however, it was the love story behind Habibie\u2019s marriage to his late wife, Hasri Ainun Habibie, that most touched their hearts, and was celebrated in two popular movies.\n\n\u201cHis love for his wife was legendary,\u201d wrote Kornelius Purba, a senior journalist for the Jakarta Post, in a column on\n\nThursday.\n\nAinun died in 2010. They are survived by two sons, neither of whom are involved in politics.", "description": "Thousands of Indonesians gathered in Jakarta on Thursday to mourn former president B.J.
