Each day, The Independent will be publishing a new story to shed light on people\u2019s experiences.\n\nWhen parents experience pregnancy or baby loss, they each have individual ways of coping with their grief and honouring the memory of their children.\n\nFor Baby Loss Awareness Week, The Independent has spoken to bereaved parents about acts of comfort that helped them find solace following their losses:\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

I remember Karen [Burgess, CEO of Petals] being sat there, and for the first session, which was an hour, she just said, \u2018Can you tell me a bit about what happened?\u2019\n\n\u201cI remember at the end of that session I said to her, \u2018Are we going to be ok?\u2019, and she said, \u2018Yes, you are.\u2019 That was the first time I thought maybe we will recover from this.\u201d\n\nNicola Rash, a 33-year-old lab manager from Suffolk, also took part in counselling sessions with Petals after experiencing two miscarriages. The first, a missed miscarriage, occurred in October 2018, and the second occurred at the end of March this year.\n\nNicola explains that after her first miscarriage, she started suffering from anxiety and was unable to sleep at night.\n\n\u201cI was functioning but not very happy. So that\u2019s when I contacted Petals and heard back in a few days,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just very nice to have someone to talk to about everything, someone who understood. They helped me to deal with things and rationalise things more, to understand how I really felt.\u201d\n\nMeeting the online community\n\nAlyx Elliott, director of strategy at Petals, experienced the stillbirth of her baby daughter, Skye, at 37 weeks in 2017. The baby loss online community, which she had previously been unaware of, helped her meet other bereaved mothers who have since become integral components of her life.\n\nI was like, \u2018I\u2019ve found the people who will get all the emotions I\u2019m going through\u2019\n\n\u201cI met them online first of all. We\u2019ve had a WhatsApp group ever since, and we still speak every single day,\u201d Alyx says. \u201cI think for me, it was the counselling and the online community that helped me find any kind of way through the emotions that I was feeling and the trauma that I\u2019d experienced.\u201d\n\nAlyx explains that she and her husband, Jonny, became \u201chermits\u201d after Skye\u2019s death, as they didn\u2019t want to \u201cface the awkwardness and the pity\u201d of other people. When she first discovered the baby loss online community, Alyx didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\n\u201cAnd then I saw reams of people just saying exactly the way I was feeling, and finally I was like, \u2018I\u2019ve found my people, I\u2019ve found the people who will get everything, all the crazy emotions I\u2019m going through\u2019.\u201d\n\nKatie similarly found solace on social media, although using hashtags such as #babyloss, #stillbornawareness and #breakthesilence on Instagram has resulted in the platform sometimes generating pregnancy advertisements on her feed. \u201cI made the decision to set up a separate account for all things baby loss to give me some control over when I interact with those accounts, making it less overwhelming,\u201d she says.\n\nBeing given heartfelt gifts\n\nFor parents who have gone through baby loss, the time they were able to spend with their babies before saying goodbye is fleeting. Therefore, being given heartfelt gifts that memorialise their children can provide them with comfort for years to come.\n\nFollowing the death of Skye, Alyx received a blank note book from one of her closest friends, which read \u201cNotes for Skye\u201d on the front cover.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing letters to Skye in there ever since,\u201d Alyx says. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite as often now, but especially at the beginning, I wrote a lot of letters to her. I wanted to cling onto everything I possibly could about her. Every memory, every thought. Because that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nAlyx adds that she also has a handful of photos of her daughter, and a piece of her hair that she wears in a locket around her neck every day.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever have. Anything like that is a comfort. It\u2019s funny because it\u2019s a comfort, but it\u2019s also a source of anger at the same time. You\u2019re like, this is all I\u2019ve got. I have her grave.\u201d\n\nAnother touching gift Alyx and her husband Jonny received was a piece of artwork made by a friend, which featured Skye\u2019s name written in the stars. \u201cBeautiful things like that, that I can keep forever, show you that they were thinking of you, and that they\u2019re thinking of Skye.\u201d\n\nKatie received a Loss Box as a gift after the death of her daughter Ottilie. The package contains a booklet and a variety of calming, herbal products, which Katie says she found \u201cuseful\u201d. \u201cThe words in The Loss Book were some of the first that I read that resonated with my grief,\u201d she adds.\n\nReceiving practical help\n\nWhen parents are trying to process the devastating loss of a baby, the support they receive from their friends and family can bring a small sense of stability to their lives, Petals CEO Karen Burgess explains.\n\n\u201cCertainly in the early days, parents are quite traumatised. So they\u2019re not really present, their brains have gone somewhere else,\u201d Karen states.\n\n\u201cThey need stabilising, so the people around them can come in and do those practical things and keep the routine going, the day-to-day operation.\u201d\n\nWe felt loved and supported in the most simple ways\n\nThese acts can include things like offering to cook them a meal, doing their grocery shopping or picking their children up from school, Karen outlines.\n\nFollowing the stillbirth of her daughter, Katie and her husband, Ben, received an ongoing supply of food for several weeks.\n\n\u201cI will be forever thankful for the nourishment it provided when I had no resolve to feed myself,\u201d Katie says.\n\n\u201cFrom outside food bing brought into hospital, home-cooked meals frozen and dropping in our porch to frozen food deliveries and vouchers, we felt loved and supported in the most simple ways.\u201d\n\nBeing shown kindness and compassion\n\nIn the short period that Alyx and Jonny were able to spend with Skye, the compassion and care their bereavement midwife showed towards their daughter \u201cmeant everything\u201d to them.\n\n\u201cThe bereavement midwife treated her almost as if she was a living baby in terms of how gently she held her, and she was the first person to say Skye\u2019s name other than us,\u201d Alyx says.\n\n\u201cThe compassion that she had meant everything to us and made us feel like we weren\u2019t at fault.\u201d\n\nIn the days following Skye\u2019s death, the bereavement midwife and her team helped Alyx and Jonny visit their baby in the chapel of rest, organised her funeral and took her hand and footprints.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put a price on the memories that creates for you, and what it means to you, not only in those moments but in months and years to come,\u201d Alyx states.\n\n\u201cJust to do little things like look at her toes and hands in detail, because we were never going to get to hold her after a few days, never see her again.\u201d\n\nKate Pinney, a midwife for baby charity Tommy\u2019s, says that she when she is supporting parents who have experienced baby loss, she places all of her focus on how she can support them.\n\n\u201cI bury anything that I may be feeling or thinking, I\u2019m just focused on the support I can provide for them,\u201d Kate explains.\n\n\u201cIt is emotional as a practitioner, because that time that you spent with those parents, you\u2019re a part of such an incredibly personal time. You hope that you\u2019ve helped as much as possible within the circumstances as a midwife.\u201d\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, you can contact stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands on 0808 164 3332 or email helpline@sands.org.uk.
