The Patriots cut Brown without paying the $9 million guaranteed money in his contract and his Week 1 salary due to alleged sexual assault and misconduct. Brown recently filed a grievance against the Patriots and the Oakland Raiders to recover around $40 million, which he claims the two teams owe him.\n\nBrown wants the Patriots to pay his Week 1 salary amounting to $64,062, his guaranteed base salary of $1.025 million and his $9 million signing bonus. Brown, who was signed by Oakland after he was released by the Pittsburgh Steelers, also wanted the Raiders to pay a huge sum of money after he was cut before the start of the regular season. In his grievance, Brown wants the Raiders to pay one week salary worth $860,294, $29 million in guaranteed money and his $1 million signing bonus. He\u2019s also challenging the $215,000 fines imposed on him for violating several team rules.\n\nBrown asks Patriots to re-sign him\n\nHowever, it was earlier reported that Patriots CEO Robert Kraft has no plan of shelling out even a penny to pay Brown after the wide receiver slammed him on Twitter and mentioned his controversial arrest in a Miami spa this year. On Wednesday, the 31-year-old Brown sparked another controversy when he went live on Instagram and suggested that the Patriots allow him to earn the money due to him by re-signing him.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

They still gotta pay me might as well let me earn it,\u201d Brown said on his live video. Brown played just one game with the Patriots, catching four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown in their 43-0 win over the Miami Dolphins.\n\nNo chance Brown will return to Patriots\n\nWhile the Patriots need an additional veteran wide receiver, there\u2019s no chance that the organization will re-sign him, according to Jeff Howe of The Athletic.\n\n\u201cBased on everything I heard the day the Patriots released Antonio Brown, there\u2019s absolutely no chance of a reunion,\u201d Howe said on his Twitter account. According to Howe, the Patriots would require an organizational heel turn \u201cunlike one I\u2019ve ever seen before\u201d to allow Brown to return. Brown\u2019s signing left a $5 million dent in the Patriots\u2019 salary cap room, affecting their ability to sign or trade for a veteran wide receiver before the Oct.\n\n29 trade deadline. The Patriots recently cut veteran tight end Ben Watson to create an additional $2 million in salary cap space, allowing them to trade for a veteran wide receiver or sign one from the free agent market. Among the names being floated are Emmanuel Sanders of the Denver Broncos and A.J. Green of the Cincinnati Bengals. When asked about the team\u2019s plans before the deadline, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said he\u2019s focused on their Week 6 clash with the New York Giants on Thursday.", "description": "Brown suggested that the Patriots allow him to earn the money due to him by re-signing him.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Zeegee Cecilio", "Read More On The Same Topic Zeegee Cecilio", "Ex-Patriots' Tight End Ben Watson Calls Tom Brady", "Ultimate Competitor", "Patriots", "Bill Belichick Focused On Week Clash With Giants", "Not On Trade Deadline", "Tom Brady Heaps Praises On Ben Watson"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/9/os/b_1200x630/browns-tenure-with-the-patriots-lasted-just-11-days-image-credit-jimmy-kimmel-liveyoutube_2336763.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
