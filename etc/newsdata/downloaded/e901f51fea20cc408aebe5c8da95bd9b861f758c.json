Olsen's wife, Kathy, left the courtroom crying as the verdict was read. Judge LaTisha Dear Jackson set Olsen's bond at $80,000 and ordered him to wear an ankle monitor and adhere to a curfew.\n\nMARYLAND POLICE OFFICER SHOT, KILLED IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY PARKING GARAGE\n\nOlsen was charged in the death of Anthony Hill, 26, an Air Force veteran who'd received diagnoses of bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. The former officer responded to the Chamblee apartment complex March 9, 2015, after the property manager called the police saying Hill was half-naked and acting strangely.\n\nHill\u2019s parents asked the judge to deny any bond.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been four years that we\u2019ve been waiting for this,\u201d said his mother, Carolyn Giummo. \u201cMy son is no longer here. ...

Stop!\u201d before shooting Hill twice, witnesses said. Prosecutors alleged Olsen used unnecessary deadly force, while defense attorneys argued he had little information about the situation and was frightened.\n\nThey said he had mere seconds to make a tough decision.\n\nThe verdict came days after a judge sentenced former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger to 10 years in prison for fatally shooting Botham Jean in his apartment in September 2018. Guyger claimed she mistook Jean's unit for hers and thought he was a burglar.\n\nDeKalb County District Attorney Sherry Boston cited the difficulties in prosecuting police officers in cases similar to Olsen's.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speculate as to what was in all those jurors\u2019 minds, but I think all of you know that these cases are very difficult, not just here in Georgia but across the United States,\u201d Boston said.\n\nIn addition to aggravated assault, Olsen was convicted of violating his oath of office and one count of making a false statement. He is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 1.", "description": "A former Georgia police officer was found not guilty Monday of killing a naked,\u00a0unarmed Afghanistan war veteran who was mentally ill.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19287699646813.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
