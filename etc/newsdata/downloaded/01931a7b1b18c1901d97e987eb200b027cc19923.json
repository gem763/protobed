It\u2019s a partisan whistleblower. He shouldn\u2019t even have information. I\u2019ve had conversations with many leaders. They\u2019re always appropriate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the identity of the whistleblower, we just know that it was a partisan person, meaning they come from a different party,\u201d Mr Trump said, after telling reporters that he \u201cfights so hard for this country\u201d.\n\nWhen asked again if he knew anything about the whistleblower, the president, visibly annoyed, fired back: \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be the media, figure it out.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nWhite House threatened with legal action for not sharing complaint\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed, someone ought to look into Joe Biden\u2019s billions of dollars and you wouldn\u2019t look into that because he\u2019s a Democrat,\u201d Mr Trump added, referring to the former vice president\u2019s comments on Ukraine.\n\nHe did not deny that he spoke to the official about the Mr Biden.\n\nThe president\u2019s response comes after his political rival Hillary Clinton accused him of seeking help from a foreign government to increase his election chances \u2013 a potential rerun of the Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the complaint involved communications with a foreign leader and a \u2018promise\u2019 that Trump made, which was so alarming that a US intelligence official who had worked at the White House went to the inspector general of the intelligence community.\n\nMr Trump spoke with the Ukrainian president a little over two weeks before the complaint was filed. That conversation, via phone, was already under investigation by House Democrats, who are determining whether Mr Trump and Rudy Guiliani, the president\u2019s lawyer, were attempting to manipulate the Ukrainian government into assisting in the president\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\n(Getty Images) More", "description": "Donald Trump has dismissed whistleblower allegations that he asked Ukraine\u2019s new president to investigate Joe Biden and his son in return for more US military support as a \u201cridiculous story\u201d.Speaking alongside his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison in the Oval Office, Mr Trump told reporters his conversations", "authors": ["Lily Puckett"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Tr65KDqxV2X5654hqaqaRw--~B/aD0zNzc7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/323803dced9a2537de650281f7de8c88", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
