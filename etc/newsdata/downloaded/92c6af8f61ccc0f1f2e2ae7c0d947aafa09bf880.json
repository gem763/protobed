Lupita Nyong'o recently took to Instagram to talk about her upcoming children's book.\n\nRepresentation and more specifically, equal representation, has been and continues to be a significant element of a continually evolving society.\n\nScience argues that people often organise their perspective of the world and their reality through representation.\n\nThese representations are often arranged in a way so that people can make certain connotations when they see or hear something familiar and express how they identify with a subject.\n\nSadly for many, seeing themselves represented in a positive light is often in short supply.\n\nSet on creating a relatable world for people of colour, and more specifically, dark-skinned girls, Academy award-winning actress, Lupita Nyong'o has proudly penned a 48-paged children's book titled, Sulwe.\n\nThe title of the book derives from her native language, Luo, and is translated as star in English.\n\nLupita first dropped news of her upcoming project back in April which is set to be released 15 October 2019.\n\nIn a recent Instagram-post, Nyong'o shared a picture of her 5-year-old self and reflected on how she had many windows into other people's lives but not really had any mirrors reflecting darker-skinned people like herself.\n\nShe continues to write, \"#Sulwe holds up a mirror for dark-skinned children especially, to see themselves reflected immediately, and it is a window for all the others to cherish peering into.\"\n\n\n\nThe book places its focus on a young girl named Sulwe, who finds herself on a journey exploring her unique beauty and identity.\n\n\n\nThe summary of the book describes Sulwe's skin colour as midnight, darker than all her family members and anyone she goes to school with.\n\nSulwe wants to be beautiful and bright (read light) like her mother and sister until a remarkable journey changes her perspective.\n\nNyong' o says, \"I imagined what it would have been like for this little girl to turn the pages of her picture books and see more dark skin in a beautiful light.\n\nThis book is my dream come true for kids like her today.\"\n\n\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.\n\nRead more:\n\nUnlock the power of a library from your phone", "description": "'A seed for children to grow and draw from in later years.'
