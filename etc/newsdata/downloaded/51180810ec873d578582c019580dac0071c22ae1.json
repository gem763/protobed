Lindsey Graham\u2019s resolution condemning the House inquiry, and the mob of 30 Republicans who physically forced their way into the secure location where the interviews were taking place.\n\nBut many people feel confused about the law and process behind an impeachment. So let me explain.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors\n\nThe House of Representatives is currently investigating the president for violating Article II, section 4 of the Constitution, which says: \u201cThe President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nSo, that brings us to our first question: what constitutes a high Crime and Misdemeanor for purposes of the Constitution?\n\nA high Crime and Misdemeanor for impeachment purposes is essentially an abuse of power by a government official. The definition has been around since the signing of the Constitution in 1787. As for what constitutes an abuse of power for purposes of defining \u201chigh Crimes and Misdemeanors\u201d \u2013 that is more of a consideration of realpolitik, rather than strict legal analysis.\n\nTake for instance then-Rep. Lindsey Graham during former president Bill Clinton\u2019s 1998 impeachment trial. Graham argued that Clinton\u2019s extramarital affair rose to the level of a high Crime and Misdemeanor for impeachment purposes. Fast-forward two decades later and Graham (now a senator) says that Trump\u2019s attempt to allegedly coerce the Ukrainian president to investigate a political opponent during an election year doesn\u2019t meet the legal threshold of an \u201cabuse of power\u201d for impeachment purposes.\n\nWhat are the articles of impeachment and what will the House do with them?\n\nBecause an impeachment trial is not the same as a criminal trial, the articles of impeachment replace what would be an indictment, or an accusation, in a criminal trial. When the House of Representatives has concluded their investigation and decided to formally charge the government official, they present the articles of impeachment, or formal charge, to the Senate.\n\nIs it legal for the House to hold its impeachment investigation interviews out of the public eye and without a legal representative of the president in the room?\n\nI spoke with Frank O Bowman III, a professor of law at the University of Missouri and author of High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump, about Republicans\u2019 outrage at the House\u2019s investigation of Trump. He explained me that, although there is a sitting Department of Justice memo that states a sitting president cannot be indicted (because it would undermine the executive office\u2019s ability to perform its constitutionally assigned functions), there is no precedent to back up Republicans\u2019 apparent claims that a sitting president can\u2019t be investigated. In fact, he told me, if you look at the investigations of president Nixon and president Clinton, it\u2019s clear that sitting presidents can and have been investigated.\n\nMuch of how the House of Representatives decides to hold the impeachment inquiry is at their discretion. Moreover, there are Republican members of the House present during the impeachment investigations, but they are members of the committees that are conducting the inquiry. At the Senate trial, the president will have legal representation, but right now the House is merely gathering information.\n\nMust the Senate hold a trial if the House impeaches the president?\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly require it. Written in 1986, the Senate rules of impeachment read as if they expect a trial after the House votes to impeach. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that the Senate will take up the impeachment resolution if the House impeaches.\n\nIf there is a Senate trial, is there a jury?\n\nNot exactly. In a Senate impeachment trial, the 100 members of the Senate act as the jury. Much like a regular jury trial, at the end of the Senate trial the 100 members of the Senate retire out of public view to deliberate on the verdict.\n\nHow does the Senate trial work?\n\nThe Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court presides over the trial, so in the case of Trump, Chief Justice John Roberts would preside. Senators rely on information provided by the House of Representatives during their investigation and in order to ask questions, the Senators must write them down on a piece of paper.\n\nHow many Senators would need to vote to convict the president during the Senate trial?\n\nA two-thirds majority of the Senate would have to vote to convict, which is extremely unlikely. That would mean that if all 47 Democratic senators (including two Independents) voted to convict, they would still need 20 more Republican votes.\n\nWhat happens after a Senate impeachment trial?\n\nIt depends on whether or not Trump is convicted in the Senate trial. If the president isn\u2019t convicted then, like former president Bill Clinton in 1998 and president Andrew Johnson in 1868, Trump would continue in office.\n\nIf Trump were to be convicted, however, then according to Article I, Sec. 3 of the Constitution, he would be removed from office. According to Prof. Bowman, \u201cin modern practice the Senate could take an additional vote after conviction and ban him from ever holding federal office again.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower.

As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year. Getty 8/19 Joe Biden The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 election. Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant.
