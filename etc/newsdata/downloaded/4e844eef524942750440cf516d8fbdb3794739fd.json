But conservative lawmakers disrupted her session as it was about to begin, refusing to leave the secure room where impeachment witnesses have met with lawmakers.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nThe demonstration marked the latest attempt by Republicans to discredit the probe into whether Trump ordered the hold on military aid to pressure Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, into launching investigations that would benefit Trump politically. It follows explosive testimony Tuesday from a key U.S. diplomat, who detailed for impeachment investigators how he was told that Trump had made release of the aid package contingent on a public pledge by Zelensky to investigate the Biden family and the 2016 U.S. election, undercutting Trump\u2019s repeated denials of a quid pro quo.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill have sought to ease pressure on the White House by launching a coordinated messaging campaign against the Democratic-led inquiry, painting it as a secretive attempt to force the president from office. Republicans have decried the closed-door format for witness depositions, aimed at preventing speakers from coordinating their testimony, and the decision to limit participation to members of three House committees, a choice consistent with congressional leaders\u2019 past approach to sensitive investigations.\n\nRepublicans on the three panels \u2014 the Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees \u2014 have been permitted to attend the depositions and ask questions. Some of those who barged in ahead of Cooper\u2019s testimony are not members of those committees.\n\nDemocrats have said they will open the process for public hearings in a matter of weeks after the initial stage of their investigation concludes. On Wednesday, the three Democratic chairmen leading the impeachment inquiry sent a letter to the State Department with a fresh demand for documents already subpoenaed that have not been turned over.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the standoff at the Capitol was resolved. Democrats debated asking the Capitol Police to physically remove the GOP members but decided against it, fearing that such a dramatic move would play into Republicans\u2019 hands, several lawmakers said.\n\nAt least 20 Republicans continued to occupy the room \u2014 called a SCIF, short for Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility \u2014 around 1:45 p.m., GOP aides said. A large number exited just after 2 p.m. to attend votes.\n\nSlideshow by photo services\n\nAs their protest entered its fifth hour on Wednesday, supporters gave no indication that the effort was close to over. The members \u201cplan to stay there until we have a more open and transparent and fair process,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a prominent conservative lawmaker and close ally of the president.\n\nThe demonstration was led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) one day after members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus met with Trump at the White House. The president urged the group \u2014 his steadfast allies \u2014 to be \u201ctough\u201d because Democrats are \u201cfighting dirty and have been fighting dirty\u201d and that \u201cmaybe it\u2019s time to take the gloves off,\u201d according to Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.), who attended.\n\nTrump on Tuesday also likened the impeachment inquiry to a \u201clynching\u201d on Twitter, drawing condemnation from Democrats and several Republicans.\n\nA senior GOP aide said Wednesday that the protest had the blessing of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and was originally scheduled for last week, before the death of Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) caused the group to change its plans. Cummings was chairman of the House Oversight Committee.\n\nThe standoff brought unexpected drama to a day which lawmakers expected to be fairly quiet.\n\nBefore Cooper\u2019s testimony was to begin, about two dozen conservative Republican members led by Gaetz gathered near the deposition room to protest what they described as Democrats\u2019 secretive approach to the inquiry. Several accused Democratic leaders of trying to undo the 2016 election result, rallying behind a talking point promoted by House GOP leaders.\n\n\u201cIf behind those doors, they intend to overturn the result of an American presidential election, we want to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Gaetz said, accusing Democrats of being \u201cobsessed with attacking a president who we believe has not done anything to deserve impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe group walked into the restricted area en masse, and chants of \u201clet us in\u201d were heard from outside.\n\nA shouting match ensued between Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) and some Democrats in the room, according to Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who witnessed the scene.\n\nAt one point, Rep. K. Michael Conaway (R-Texas), a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee, started to collect the Republicans\u2019 phones, appearing to realize having the electronics there was a bad idea, Connolly said.\n\nGohmert, one of Trump\u2019s top defenders, used the opportunity to rail against what he described as injustice toward the president. Many Democrats sat watching, not wanting to engage.\n\nMinutes after entering, several members of the group who do not sit on committees involved in the inquiry walked out, saying they were barred from the room.\n\n\u00a9 Patrick Semansky/AP President Trump\u2019s congressional allies protest outside the planned impeachment deposition of Laura Cooper, a Ukraine expert at the Pentagon.\n\nThe demonstration was the second attempt by non-committee Republicans to gain access in two weeks.\n\n\u201cThey refused us once again,\u201d said Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.). \u201cThis is an outrage.\u201d\n\nThe protest caused House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to consult the House Sergeant at Arms about how to proceed, according to one Democratic lawmaker who witnessed the scene. Several protesting members had apparently tweeted from inside the SCIF, a security breach as cellphones are prohibited inside. The area is tightly restricted to allow lawmakers to review sensitive material without the risk of surveillance.\n\n\u201cReporting from Adam B. Schiff\u2019s secret chamber,\u201d Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) wrote on Twitter just before noon. Biggs stated that about 15 Republican lawmakers remained in the SCIF at that time. Other lawmakers who posted to Twitter later sought to clarify that they had transmitted their tweets to staff, who in turn posted the comments on social media.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the Intelligence committee, said the Republicans compromised the SCIF\u2019s security by using their cellphones.\n\n\u201cDozens of members brought in electronics,\u201d he said. \u201cThey not only brought in their unauthorized bodies, they may have brought in the Russians and the Chinese with electronics into a secure space, which will require that the space at some point in time be desensitized.\u201d\n\nMeadows, speaking to reporters from a makeshift podium, insisted that there were \u201cno cameras or phones in the SCIF.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually collected phones and brought them back out,\u201d he said. \u201cYou certainly want a secure environment.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are familiar with the rules governing secure facilities on Capitol Hill, which they used for investigating the deadly 2012 attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya. Democrats derided that probe as a witch hunt against Hillary Clinton, who was then secretary of state.\n\nA senior GOP aide dismissed concerns about the Republicans bringing electronics into the SCIF, stating that it was no worse than the actions of Connolly, a member of the House Oversight Committee, who read testimony from an impeachment witness publicly last week.\n\nThe prospect of Cooper\u2019s testimony had raised the possibility of fresh revelations one day after acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine William B. Taylor Jr. seemed to weaken Trump\u2019s denial of a quid pro quo involving military aid to Ukraine.\n\nIn a 15-page opening statement, Taylor gave a detailed account of his growing awareness between June and mid-September that Trump was seeking to pressure Zelensky into investigating a domestic political opponent.\n\nJoe Biden, the former vice president, is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. His son Hunter was a board member at Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings from 2014 to mid-April of this year.\n\nTaylor also described two distinct channels he said emerged for U.S. policymaking toward Ukraine under Trump \u2014 one overseen by the diplomatic establishment and another overseen by the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, with assistance from several Trump appointees.\n\n\u201cThe push to make President Zelenskyy publicly commit to investigations of Burisma and alleged interference in the 2016 election showed how the official foreign policy of the United States was undercut by the irregular efforts led by Mr. Giuliani,\u201d Taylor told lawmakers.\n\nCooper is expected to provide insight into an assessment described by Taylor and conducted by the Pentagon that gauged the effectiveness of U.S. aid to Ukraine after it was put on hold. The effort led to a recommendation that the aid be reinstated.\n\nA career bureaucrat who has served in the Pentagon since 2001, Cooper is unlikely to have had many interactions with the president or his inner circle, but she would have played a role in overseeing much of the roughly $391 million in aid at issue in the impeachment probe.\n\nCooper is also expected to detail interagency meetings in which senior officials discussed the need for aid and the best ways to convince Trump to resume it. The White House released the funds in September under bipartisan pressure from lawmakers.\n\nShe is the eighth witness to speak to lawmakers in person since the inquiry launched in late September.\n\nelise.viebeck@washpost.com\n\nrachael.bade@washpost.com\n\nkayla.epstein@washpost.com\n\nMike DeBonis, Karoun Demirjian, Greg Jaffe and John Wagner contributed to this report.", "description": "Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper was expected to answer questions about the mechanics of U.S. security assistance for Ukraine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAJeOp5.img?h=201&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=2188&y=1978", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
