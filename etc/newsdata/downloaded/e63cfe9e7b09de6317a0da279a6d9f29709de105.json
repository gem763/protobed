Then, Boston. Then, Toronto.\n\nOver the past six days, WeWork executives have raced from city to city in an attempt to win over increasingly skeptical investors.\n\nBut by the time the company\u2019s Gulfstream G-6 touched down outside New York late Tuesday night, the grandiose ambitions of Adam Neumann, the company\u2019s brash co-founder and pitchman, remained poised on a knife\u2019s edge. His own fortune, while still enviable, was rapidly slipping away.\n\nWith WeWork\u2019s valuation plummeting, anxiety is growing about when, how or even whether the hipster office-rental company should go public, with even its own bankers unnerved. In question, too, is where this now leaves other fast-growing, money-burning companies \u2013 the so-called unicorns.\n\nRarely has the view from the corner office been so at odds with the view from the marketplace. WeWork\u2019s predicament has exposed the yawning gap between what private investors think a young company might be worth and what that company might actually fetch in the stock market.\n\nNeumann, who over the years helped WeWork raise more than $12 billion while never turning a dime of profit, is said to be pressing ahead with plans for an initial public offering while simultaneously hunting for still more private capital.\n\nAt the same time, WeWork is considering changing various corporate governance practices, according to people with knowledge of the situation.\n\nStaff Meeting\n\nWith so much up in the air, WeWork planned to hold a town hall-style meeting for employees at its New York headquarters on Thursday. But executives called off the event, citing scheduling conflicts, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nBoth of its lead financial advisers -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. -- have concerns about proceeding with an IPO that could value the company as low as $15 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are confidential. That\u2019s set off a push to make the public sale more palatable to potential investors with governance reforms.\n\nAny decision ultimately rests with Neumann, who maintains voting control through a three-class share structure and has been an adamant proponent of the IPO, the people said.\n\nHe also has been criticized for borrowing the firm\u2019s money, leasing properties he owns back to the company and selling chunks of equity ahead of the planned IPO. The firm rents space in four buildings owned by Neumann, according to the prospectus. It signed a lease on three of them the day he obtained his stake, and committed to being a tenant in them within the next year.\n\nLackluster Debuts\n\nSuch disclosures -- and the billions of dollars of losses the firm has racked up in recent years -- increased unease among investors already frustrated by the lackluster market debuts of Silicon Valley darlings such as Uber Technologies Inc.\n\nUntil recently, Neumann was poised to become one of the world\u2019s richest entrepreneurs. Earlier this year, more than a decade after he launched WeWork, some bankers were privately touting a valuation as high as $65 billion. That would have pegged Neumann\u2019s current 22% stake at $14 billion, catapulting him into the ranks of the world\u2019s 150 richest people.\n\nNow, based on more recent valuations, Neumann\u2019s stake might be worth as little as $3 billion \u2013 not enough for a listing in the 500-member Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nStill, that\u2019s nothing to sneeze at, particularly for someone who spent part of his childhood on a kibbutz. Neumann moved to New York from Israel in 2001 to have fun and make a lot of money, as he put it in a commencement address at Baruch College, his alma mater. Then he met Rebekah, his future wife, who\u2019s listed in a prospectus as a co-founder, chief brand and impact officer, and a \u201cstrategic thought partner.\u201d\n\nSoftBank Stakes\n\nThe stakes are even higher for SoftBank, WeWork\u2019s largest investor, which added to its stake in January at a $47 billion valuation. WeWork needs to raise at least $3 billion through an IPO to tap into an additional $6 billion credit line that bankers have been setting up in recent weeks. The facility requires the company to carry out its offering by Dec. 31, one of the people said.\n\nThe goal is to conclude a roadshow and price the offering before Rosh Hashana, one of the people said, effectively setting a deadline of Sept. 27. Getting it done beforehand would allow Neumann, 40, to avoid using technology and observe the holiday in compliance with Jewish orthodoxy.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- First, WeWork hit London.
