I believe him, and I would work with him anytime,\u201d the actor told The Hollywood Reporter in a feature published Wednesday.\n\nJohansson, who has worked with Allen on films including \u201cMatch Point\u201d and \u201cVicky Cristina Barcelona,\u201d did not condemn Allen like many of her Hollywood peers have. Since Farrow spoke out in 1992, Allen, 83, has continually denied the accusations that he molested her.\n\nIn the wake of the Me Too movement, Farrow continued to speak out against Allen, spurring many stars to distance themselves from the director. Johansson, however, told THR that she believes Allen is innocent and fully supports him.\n\n\u201cI see Woody whenever I can, and I have had a lot of conversations with him about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI have been very direct with him, and he\u2019s very direct with me. He maintains his innocence, and I believe him.\u201d\n\nJohansson added that \u201cit\u2019s an intense time\u201d to discuss sexual abuse accusations like those Allen is facing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard because it\u2019s a time where people are very fired up, and understandably,\u201d she said. \u201cThings needed to be stirred up, and so people have a lot of passion and a lot of strong feelings and are angry, and rightfully so.\u201d\n\nOther big stars have also continued to work with Allen despite the allegations against him, including Justin Timberlake, Javier Bardem, Blake Lively and Kate Winslet.\n\nHead over to The Hollywood Reporter to read Johansson\u2019s full interview.", "description": "The actor said she will continue to support and work with the director despite allegations that he sexually abused his adoptive daughter, Dylan Farrow.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6fd1473b00004900ccce44.jpeg?cache=re6ql5n6dy&ops=1778_1000"}
