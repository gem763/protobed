REUTERS/Adama Diarra\n\nBAMAKO (Reuters) - A U.N. peacekeeper was killed and four others wounded on Sunday when their vehicle hit an explosive device in northern Mali, the U.N. mission (MINUSMA) said.\n\nThe identity of the attackers was not immediately clear.\n\nU.N. peacekeeping and French forces are stationed in Mali to combat jihadist groups seen as threatening security across Africa\u2019s Sahel region.\n\nThe soldiers had been participating in a patrol near the village of Aguelhok when the blast hit, U.N. mission spokesman Olivier Salgado tweeted. Elsewhere on Sunday, peacekeepers in Mali\u2019s central region of Mopti exchanged fire with members of an unidentified armed group after they came under attack, he said.\n\n\u201cMINUSMA chief (Mahamat Saleh) Annadif strongly condemns the recent resurgence of this type of attacks, particularly in the centre of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe West African country has been in conflict since 2012 when Islamists hijacked an ethnic uprising by Tuaregs in the north. More recently the violence has moved to central Mali, where fighting between farmers and herders has also surged this year.\n\nJihadist groups have exploited ethnic rivalries in Mali and its neighbours to boost recruitment and render swathes of territory ungovernable.\n\nLess than a week ago, 38 Malian soldiers were killed in a double attack on two army camps in central Mali - among the heaviest losses for Mali\u2019s army in recent years.
