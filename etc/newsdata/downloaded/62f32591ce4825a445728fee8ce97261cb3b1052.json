He\u2019d previously given the suggestion short shrift when asked in August by The Age\u2019s Rob Harris. \u201cI don\u2019t know where these ridiculous suggestions come from.\u201d The indignance!\n\nFunnily enough, they probably come from the high-level discussions Dreyfus has held on Spring Street with everyone from Premier Daniel Andrews, former Attorney-General Martin Pakula, his successor Jill Hennessy and his caucus colleagues. Or from his threats to quit parliament in October 2018, or his indiscreet utterances around the traps.\n\nPredictably, his unfaithful denial was enough for the Twittersphere \u2013 especially former Crikey gossip Stephen Mayne, who managed to see this through the prism of his own running, provincial feud with 1990s blog rival Andrew Landeryou (and by extension his wife, Labor Senator Kimberley Kitching). Yawn. We certainly don\u2019t need anyone else to tell us what we think of the learned member for Isaacs.\n\nWe won\u2019t easily forget the torrential scorn we copped in September 2016 when we wrote that George Brandis would replace Alexander Downer as High Commissioner in London. Brandis renounced our tale, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull refuted it, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop categorically denied it and so did the government: \u201cGeorge Brandis is not going to London. George is not under consideration,\u201d a source said. And where\u2019s George now?\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure, though: Dreyfus will not be replacing Justice Chris Maxwell as President of Victoria\u2019s Court of Appeal. Contrary to speculation (ours included), Maxwell does not intend to step down before his mandatory retirement date in January 2023, his 70th birthday. Nevertheless, there are a multitude of routes onto the Supreme Court bench for Dreyfus before the next Victorian and federal elections in 2022. At 63 himself, Dreyfus hasn\u2019t got much longer than that.", "description": "Mark Dreyfus has denied he'll quit parliament for an appointment to Victoria's Supreme Court.
