Board of Education, an era of de jure segregation in the public schools. That ended early in his life; he never lived to see the end of de facto segregation, and I do not think that any of us is likely to. He did live to see a sea change in American attitudes toward race and the election of a black president. He is the first black member of the House to lie in state in the rotunda. These represent momentous changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCummings also lived to see the decline of Baltimore, the nearly complete abandonment of the Republican party by black voters, and the nearly complete abandonment of black voters by the Republican party. Cummings entered the House in 1996, succeeding Kweisi Mfume, who left to lead the NAACP; Mfume had succeeded Parren Mitchell, Maryland\u2019s first black congressman, representing Maryland\u2019s first majority-black House district. In that sense, Cummings\u2019s career might be read as a kind of postscript to the civil-rights era, one of many and one that Republicans would do well to think on.\n\nIt should hardly need repeating in 2019, but the Republican party is distinct from the conservative movement. The Republican party \u2014 which really was, once, the Party of Lincoln \u2014 has a good deal to say for itself on the question of civil rights. President Dwight Eisenhower was irritated by Earl Warren\u2019s sweeping decision in Brown and is reported to have said (the quotation is disputed) that nominating the former Republican governor of California \u2014 \u201cthat dumb son of a bitch Earl Warren\u201d \u2014 was the worst mistake of his presidency. But Eisenhower, who had once reveled in the title \u201csupreme commander,\u201d was no presidential supremacist. \u201cThe Supreme Court has spoken, and I am sworn to uphold the constitutional processes in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I will obey.\u201d His language was tepid, but Eisenhower was a man in full when it came to doing his duty. In a subsequent standoff with Orval Faubus, the segregationist Democratic governor of Arkansas, Eisenhower dispatched the 101st Airborne to escort black students into Little Rock Central High School. It is a testament both to Eisenhower\u2019s personal stature and the complicated facts of race and partisanship in the South that, in the wake of Brown, Eisenhower did a little bit better in the South than Barry Goldwater would running against the civil-rights bill in 1964.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(People sometimes forget that Lyndon Johnson won a majority of southern votes in his contest against Goldwater.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tragedy of the Republican party is that it has followed practically its every achievement in civil rights with a sigh of relief and an unspoken (sometimes spoken) understanding that this, finally \u2014 from the Civil War to the 13th Amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1866, of 1957, or of 1964 \u2014 disposed of the question of African Americans\u2019 place in American life, liberating the Republican party to go back to being a conservative business-interest party, which is what it is in its heart, such as it is. (And that isn\u2019t so bad.) The insufficiency of that view should be obvious, even to a politician.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe distinct tragedy of the conservative movement is that (for reasons both principled and sometimes less than admirable) we often get it wrong when trying to balance our temperamental resistance to social change per se (which necessarily will put conservatives on the wrong side of some issues) with our philosophical dedication to the principles of the American Founding and the project of working toward making more perfect their imperfect implementation.\n\nRepresentative Cummings understood himself as a civil-rights leader, but the legislation most closely identified with him was mainly constituent-services stuff for the federal employees in his district, who represent one of the most powerful forces in U.S. politics. This is not to disparage Cummings\u2019s record on civil rights; to the contrary, it highlights an unhappy fact of political life: When it comes to civil rights in 2019, the Democrats do not have a lot of competition from the other party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans have not won the majority of African Americans\u2019 votes in a presidential contest since the election of Herbert Hoover nor a majority of African Americans\u2019 votes in congressional races since the 1940s. (The drift of southern whites away from the Democratic party and the exit of African Americans from the GOP both are rooted in the New Deal, though of course race and other contributors are at play.) But even though they did not win majorities, Republicans once could achieve significant support among black voters: Eisenhower won about 40 percent of the black vote in spite of his frosty welcome of Brown. Politics always is in flux, and there are no silver bullets. Democrats believe that if they can put Texas in their column, then Republicans will never win another presidential election. In reality, Texas once was a solidly Democratic state while California was a strongly Republican state. Things change. But Republicans, if only for reasons of narrow self-interest, ought to appreciate that even a respectable losing margin among black voters would be a game-changer for them: Democrats could lose a lot of presidential races with two-thirds of the black vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what might Republicans say to the people of Baltimore who elected Elijah Cummings to office? That their city is a nest of vermin, that \u201cno human being would want to live there\u201d? Baltimore is a mess, but human beings do live there \u2014 American human beings, at that. So far, black Americans have remained largely unmoved by Republican promises of tax cuts and regulatory reform. Many black families are with the GOP on school choice, but not enough to pull the \u201cR\u201d lever. And the reason for this ought to be obvious enough: While African Americans may be with the Republican party on this or that issue, they do not believe that the Republican party is with them. But it once was. And it is no great mystery how to change that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans would like to have more support among black voters. But they despise the cities where many African Americans live and where they predominate politically; Republicans have ruled out cuts to the entitlement programs that disproportionately benefit whites but take a rather more skeptical view of the means-tested social programs that disproportionately benefit African Americans; when there are questions of police misbehavior, Republicans instinctively side with the police; they were hellfire and brimstone on crack but have taken a gentle turn on opioids, which are abused in large measure by rural and suburban whites, etc. And what do Republicans now have to say for themselves?\n\nWell, did you know that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed on disproportionately strong Republican support? Or, Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job that is being recognized more and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember Gettysburg?\n\nBlack unemployment did hit a record low in 2019, and that is to be celebrated. But the steep decline in black unemployment began almost a decade ago. The prosperity gospel is lousy theology but it is very fine politics \u2014 done right. \u201cLook what the Mighty Trump hath done for you, poor black folks who aren\u2019t swift enough to understand your own interests!\u201d is not what \u201cdone right\u201d means. Vacillating between indifference and condescension is not going to get it done.\n\nMaybe Republicans will just keep saying, \u201cWhat have Elijah Cummings and his brand of politics ever really done for African Americans?\u201d That\u2019s a fair question, and a fair line of criticism.\n\nBut after the criticism \u2014 what?", "description": "The GOP should see that even a respectable losing margin among black voters could be a game-changer for it.", "authors": ["Kevin D.
