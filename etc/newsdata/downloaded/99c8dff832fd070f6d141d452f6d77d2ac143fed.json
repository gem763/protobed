They also condemned Turkey's \"military action\" in Syria and Ankara's drilling for oil and gas off the coast of Cyprus.\n\nBut the consensus was delayed by Turkey's old ally, the U.K., which wanted softer language, much to the annoyance of Federica Mogherini, the EU's outgoing foreign policy chief, and her successor Josep Borrell, according to three diplomats.\n\nAll other EU countries backed the tougher stance, with Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok saying that \u201cwithout condemnation this paper will be useless,\" one of the diplomats said.\n\nBut in the end, London caved and the condemnation was made public, as was an extra line of text stressing that \u201cTurkey is a key partner of the European Union.\u201d\n\nThe move came after Turkey launched an incursion into northern Syria last week in a bid to drive Syrian Kurdish fighters away from the Syrian-Turkish border.\n\nSome diplomats from EU member states were surprised that the often divided Foreign Affairs Council found any sort of unity and was able to agree that EU countries will \u201ccommit to strong national positions regarding their arms export policy to Turkey.\u201d That's not quite an EU-wide arms embargo. \u201cWe have left to member states the commitment to do it because this can be done with immediate effect,\u201d Luigi Di Maio, the foreign minister of Italy, told reporters at the end of the meeting.\n\nThe impact is expected to be the same as a ban. Member states will no longer sell weapons to Turkey and there will be no need for long, technical meetings at EU level in order to put in place an embargo, diplomats say. Germany, France, Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands have already brought in their own bans.\n\nThe move came after Turkey launched an incursion into northern Syria last week in a bid to drive Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom Ankara considers to be terrorists, away from the Syrian-Turkish border. The operation has already displaced some 100,000 people, according to the United Nations.\n\nIt is also a reaction to criticism that the EU has little leverage when dealing with Turkey \u2014 the bloc relies on Ankara to help manage migration \u2014 and that without military power, the EU cannot properly defend its interests.\n\n\u201cThe U.S withdrawal from Syria and the Turkish offensive have once again demonstrated Europe\u2019s geopolitical weakness,\u201d liberal MEP Guy Verhofstadt said in a tweet. Turkey and Russia \u201cdecide on our safety. Europe must take its destiny into its own hands by building a real Defense Union.\u201d\n\nDrilling decision\n\nThe EU foreign ministers also agreed that \u201ca framework regime\" of \"restrictive measures\" targeting those \"responsible for or involved in the illegal drilling activity of hydrocarbons in the Eastern Mediterranean is put in place,\u201d inviting Mogherini and the Commission \u201cto swiftly present proposals to this effect.\u201d\n\nEU leaders are expected to discuss Turkey at a summit in Brussels on Thursday, where they will debate the overall line to take with Ankara.\n\nOn Sunday, the Syrian Kurds struck a deal with the Moscow-backed Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad, handing over control of several towns in exchange for protection from Turkey.\n\nThat's prompted concern among Ankara's allies over a potential confrontation between Syrian forces and Turkey, a NATO member.\n\n\u201cTurkey is part of NATO and since this morning there is a coalition between Assad and the Kurds. This means that a NATO member [Turkey] will stand against Assad who is still the de facto president of Syria,\u201d said Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn on his way into Monday's meeting.\n\nAnkara, for its part, has shrugged off any concerns, with President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan saying that Russia has shown a \"positive approach.\"\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on Erdo\u011fan \u201cto act with restraint and in coordination with other allies\u201d to avoid undermining NATO\u2019s efforts in recent years to fight the Islamic State.\n\nAsselborn also criticized the U.S. decision to withdraw its troops from the area, which in effect green-lighted the Turkish military operation. \u201cWe are facing a phenomenon that has appeared following Erdo\u011fan's talks with [U.S. President Donald] Trump and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and was given the green light,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the insistence of France, the EU ministers urged Washington to call for \u201ca ministerial meeting of the International Coalition against Daesh [the Arabic acronym for Islamic State] in order to address how to pursue its efforts in the current context.\u201d\n\nNATO unease\n\nThe situation along the Turkish-Syrian border poses real problems for NATO, which finds itself obligated to support Turkey, as a member of the alliance, even as other allies, including the European Union, criticize Ankara.\n\nIn her final press conference in Luxembourg, Mogherini pointed out NATO's discomfort. She said that being part of the alliance is not a problem for the EU members who are also part of NATO but \u201cthat it might be complicated for NATO to handle a situation like this.\u201d\n\nAnd it is.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday that he recognizes Turkey\u2019s \u201clegitimate security concerns\u201d but also called on Erdo\u011fan \u201cto act with restraint and in coordination with other allies\u201d to avoid undermining NATO\u2019s efforts in recent years to fight the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cTurkey has legitimate security concerns,\u201d Stoltenberg said in London, where he addressed a meeting of the NATO parliamentary assembly. \u201cNo other ally has suffered more terrorist attacks. No other ally is more exposed to the instability, violence and turmoil from the Middle East. And no other ally hosts so many refugees from Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cNevertheless,\u201d he continued, \u201cI expect Turkey to act with restraint and in coordination with other allies so that we can preserve the gains we have made against our common enemy \u2014 Daesh [ISIS]. A few years ago, Daesh controlled significant territory in Iraq and Syria. Working together in the Global Coalition, we have liberated all this territory and millions of people. These gains must not be jeopardized.\u201d\n\nDavid Herszenhorn contributed reporting.", "description": "UK wanted softer language but was eventually persuaded to back the bloc\u2019s condemnation.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Zia Weise", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175388376-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
