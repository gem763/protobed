The comments were also spread virally on the company\u2019s Messenger app, as well as being shared on Facebook\n\nREAD: Inside the war to kill off 8chan \u2014 and crush QAnon\n\nThe 25-year-old student went to the police on Friday night to report his account had been hacked and that the hackers were demanding 20,000 Bangladeshi Taka ($235) or threatening to post blasphemous comments to his Facebook page.\n\nPolice in Bhola, the country's largest island, said they were able to identify two people involved in the hack of the Facebook account almost immediately and arrested them on Friday evening.\n\n\u201cWe have got all information relating to the Facebook hacking,\u201d Sarkar Md Kaiser, superintendent of police in Bhola told the Daily Star.\n\nDespite this Biplop was arrested at his home on Friday night. He was detained all weekend, and on Monday he was charged with spreading messages demeaning Islam under the Digital Security Act.\n\nAnger among the Muslim community \u2014 which makes up 90 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s population \u2014 grew over the weekend, as the posts continued to be shared as screenshots via messaging apps.\n\nThe man\u2019s home was burned and a dozen other buildings linked to the Hindu community were also vandalized.\n\nSenior police and religious leaders met on Saturday to call for calm, but on Sunday, 20,000 Muslims demonstrated at a prayer ground in Borhanuddin to call for the execution of the 25-year-old Hindu man.\n\n\n\nInitially peaceful, the protest soon turned violent as some of the demonstrators began throwing rocks at police officers. The officers barricaded themselves in a nearby compound, but the protesters attempted to break down the door, with the police claiming they feared for their lives.\n\n\"The door was about to be broken. The window grill was almost broken. We had put a mattress against the window. We had to fire, we had no options,\" said AKM Ehsanullah, a senior police official in the Barisal Range, Bangladesh, told CNN.\n\nREAD: The White House is very sorry about the video showing Trump mass-murdering the media\n\nThe police had initially tried to disperse the crown with pellet guns but this had not worked.\n\n\u201cOur heads would have been crushed by bricks. If they could get inside, we would all have died,\u201d Ehsanullah added. Over 100 protesters were injured in the shooting.\n\nThere have been large demonstrations by Muslim groups in Bangladesh since the attack, with leaders condemning the police action and calling for compensation for the families of those killed and injured.\n\nThe Bhola superintendent has also had his Facebook account hacked, and his phone number has been spammed with fake phone calls.\n\nThis is not the first violent incident in Bangladesh stemming from social media posts. In 2016, Islamic attacked Hindu temples in eastern Brahmanbaria town over a Facebook post that made fun of Islam\u2019s holiest sites. Back in 2012, several Buddhist monasteries were set on fire by Muslim extremists after a post showing the desecration of the Quran was posted by a fake Facebook account of a Buddhist youth.\n\nSunday\u2019s incident once again shows how governments and tech giants are struggling to prevent the spread of hate speech, especially in non-English speaking markets around the world.\n\nFacebook has been widely criticized for failing to invest sufficient resources into combating the problem in countries where minorities are targeting with this type of abuse, as recent incidents in India and Myanmar have shown.\n\n\u201cStates and companies are failing to prevent \u2018hate speech\u2019 from becoming the next \u2018fake news\u2019, an ambiguous and politicized term subject to governmental abuse and company discretion,\u201d Faisel said. \u201cThough violence motivated by hatred on grounds of religion or belief is frequent and widespread, the recent acts of extreme violence in Bangladesh has brought into sharp relief the imperative to take action to protect rights and address the root causes of hate.\u201d\n\nFacebook has not responded to a request to comment on the incident.\n\nCover: Members of Hefazat-e-Islam take part in a protest in Dhaka on October 22, 2019, two-days after deadly clashes when police shot Bangladeshi Muslims protesting over Facebook messages that allegedly defamed the Prophet Mohammed.
