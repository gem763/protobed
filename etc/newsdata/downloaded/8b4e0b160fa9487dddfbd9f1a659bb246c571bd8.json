This would set a dangerous precedent where the courts of one country can control what internet users in another country can see. This could be open to abuse, particularly by regimes with weak human rights records.\u201d\n\nFULL TEXT: The EU And Facebook's New Online 'Code Of Conduct' Policing Free Speech https://t.co/MIkFrZU3WV pic.twitter.com/yZRHbJmISm \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 31, 2016\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "The EU Court of Justice ruled EU governments can order Facebook to remove content worldwide after an Austrian politician was insulted online.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/zuckerberg-eu-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
