In reality, costs really impact the returns investors make. Investors cannot control the markets, but they can control the fees they pay.'\n\nThe fund management industry has been fiercely criticised for overcharging, and not spelling out how much savers are paying. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, has told firms to provide clearer information.\n\nConsumer campaigners have long complained that while some active fund managers are worth paying extra for, many fail to beat a stock market tracker while charging a hefty premium for their services.\n\nThe fee on Vanguard's UK's Equity Income Index fund is being cut from 0.22 per cent to 0.14 per cent.\n\nAn investment of \u00a310,000 in Woodford's Equity Income fund when it launched in July 2014 would now be worth just \u00a38,533.\n\nOver the same period, a \u00a310,000 investment in Vanguard UK Equity Income Index would have grown in value to \u00a312,043.\n\nCharges might seem small but they have a huge impact in the long term. A \u00a310,000 investment which grows 6 per cent a year would be worth \u00a317,908 after ten years with no charges.\n\nBut it would be worth \u00a316,602 \u2013 \u00a31,306 less \u2013 if a charge of 0.8 per cent is imposed.\n\nJustin Modray of Candid Financial Advice said: 'Trust has been damaged by the Woodford fiasco and the best-buy lists offered by firms, including Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nIt's always welcome to see any fund manager cut charges. Trackers are a great idea but investors should not write off active managers, as they can provide better performance.\n\n'If investors look carefully at what funds are holding, they should not be caught out by the likes of Woodford.'", "description": "Vanguard, which manages \u00a34.7trillion of assets, has slashed fees on 36 tracker funds to attract savers disillusioned by years of high charges and poor returns.", "authors": ["James Salmon For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
