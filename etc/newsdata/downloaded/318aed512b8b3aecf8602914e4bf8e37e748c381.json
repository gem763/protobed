Her responses were circulated last Wednesday to lawmakers on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), which published the document \u2014 previously reported by POLITICO \u2014 on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe discussion on whether, and if so how, central banks and banking supervisors can contribute to mitigating climate change is at an early stage but should be seen as a priority,\u201d Lagarde said. \u201cClimate change is one of the most pressing global challenges facing society today.\u201d\n\nThe Q&A is a rehearsal for a hearing in ECON on September 4, when lawmakers will grill the International Monetary Fund (IMF) boss on her credentials for the most powerful job in the eurozone. Their recommendation would be a nonbinding but politically necessary step toward her formal appointment by EU leaders.\n\nLagarde's responses point to continuing the policies of monetary stimulus that Draghi embraced through his tenure.\n\nThe former finance minister, a lawyer by training in a field seen as the preserve of economists, is arriving at a tricky time for the ECB. Analysts expect the central bank to resume cutting interest rates and adding to its \u20ac2.6 trillion easy money program in mid-September, amid concerns about weak if not negative economic growth in the 19 countries of the eurozone.\n\nLagarde's responses point to continuing the policies of monetary stimulus that Draghi embraced through his tenure. That includes low interest rates and bond-buying programs to lift the eurozone\u2019s inflation rate to just under 2 percent, helping spur the economy.\n\n\u201cSignificant monetary accommodation will be needed for a prolonged period of time\u201d to mitigate economic uncertainties stemming from global trade tensions and low inflation, the 63-year old said in her written responses, aligning with comments made during her tenure atop the IMF.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore important to keep all policy tools on the table in order to respond appropriately and proportionately if the medium-term inflation outlook continues to fall short of the ECB\u2019s aim,\u201d she added.\n\nA green touch\n\nHer comments on monetary policy came as little surprise to ING Chief Economist Carsten Brzeski, who expects the ECB to unveil a stimulus package on September 12 that includes a bond-buying program \u2014 called quantitative easing (QE) \u2014 of \u20ac30 billion a month.\n\n\u201cJudging from these answers, Lagarde will continue the Draghi legacy,\u201d Brzeski said. \u201cAnd, indeed, we could get a green touch to future ECB policies, particularly when it comes to any restart of QE.\u201d\n\nDraghi's ECB has so far avoided favoring green over brown when buying bonds. The central bankers have insisted on what they call \u201cmarket neutrality,\u201d meaning debt from a coal mining company is treated the same as that of a wind power producer.\n\nLagarde suggested that could change in her answers to the Parliament questionnaire, which included several queries on climate matters.\n\nBut first the EU must figure out what it considers as green assets, in a taxonomy now being prepared for use by companies and investors to steer money toward low-carbon business.\n\n\u201cThe ECB is supporting the development of such a taxonomy,\u201d Lagarde said. \u201cOnce it is agreed, in my view it will facilitate the incorporation of environmental considerations in central bank portfolios.\u201d\n\nGreen lawmaker Sven Giegold responded to Lagarde's answers that he is \u201chappy on a lot of the points and I\u2019m glad that the greening of central banks will continue under her leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s asked directly on this and she shows no understanding of the risks and they have to be managed, taken seriously\u201d \u2014 Green MEP Sven Giegold\n\nNegative effects\n\nBut Giegold, a German member of ECON, stopped short of full praise for the French candidate. He called her answers \u201ca bit scary and evasive\u201d on questions about dangers to the economy from years of monetary stimulus and low interest rates.\n\nGiegold said rising house prices, attributed in part to Draghi's easy money, has set back some people from being able to afford property.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s holding of corporate and government bonds also has brought down debt yields, to the point that pension funds are investing in riskier assets to seek the return needed for future retirement payouts.\n\n\u201cAll things considered,\u201d Lagarde said in the questionnaire, without the ECB's \u201cunconventional monetary policy ... euro area citizens would be, overall, worse off.\u201d\n\nGiegold isn't convinced.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s asked directly on this and she shows no understanding of the risks and they have to be managed, taken seriously,\u201d the MEP said. \u201cI\u2019m not one of those Germans that say it\u2019s all the ECB fault, but she takes no [aspect] of the negative side seriously.\u201d\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
