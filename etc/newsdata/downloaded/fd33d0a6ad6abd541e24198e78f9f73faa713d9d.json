Well, turns out, it has happened before,\u201d Carlson said.\n\n\u201cBack in 2000, President Bill Clinton had a conversation with Tony Blair of the U.K. and asked him to intercede in a dispute between British Airways and two carriers. The president, at the time, was much more direct than President Trump was in his conversation.\n\n\u201cThis is Bill Clinton, and I\u2019m quoting: \u2018In a political season, it would be big over here to get this open sore resolved. If you could have somebody take a look at it.\u2019 Tony Blair responded that he would,\u201d the host said, reading from the transcript.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarlson went on to say the conversation is \u201cnot really\u201d a big deal, but it is clearly \u201can attempt to use a foreign country to influence the outcome of an election in a presidential year.\u201d\n\nThe revelation comes as Democrats, who are pursuing impeachment, allege that President Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine, pushing the country to investigate the Bidens in exchange for military aid.\n\nCarlson said there are probably many more examples in old Clinton transcripts. \u201cIf we find them we will bring them to you,\u201d he promised.", "description": ".10/08/2019 8:06:39AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/58/e6489d6d-d109-4f41-871f-732aeabad127.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
