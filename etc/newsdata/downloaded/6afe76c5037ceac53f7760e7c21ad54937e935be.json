But when I hit the key that was supposed to bring those desktops up on my screen, I didn\u2019t see anything. I did some checking around, and I found that the feature was expected to be available as of version 77 of Chrome OS \u2014 several iterations after the version I was running.\n\nWhile Chromebooks pretty much run on their own, and you can usually ignore which version of the operating system your device is running, you may want to have that information available just in case you do need it. All you have to do is follow these steps:\n\nClick on the clock in the lower right corner of your screen.\n\nSelect the \u201cSettings\u201d icon (the gear in the upper row of the pop-up window).\n\nFind \u201cAbout Chrome OS\u201d on the bottom of the left-hand menu and select it.\n\nYour version number will be just below the Google Chrome OS title on top of the window. A button on the right of that number will let you check for any new updates, or install any updates that have been recently downloaded, but not yet installed.\n\nIf you want any additional information about the inner workings of Chrome OS \u2014 for example, if you want to know which channel your Chromebook is running, or the date of the current OS build \u2014 just click on \u201cDetailed build information.\u201d You can also use this page to check out what\u2019s new in your current version of Chrome OS, go to Google\u2019s help pages, or report an issue.", "description": "While Chromebooks pretty much run on their own, and you can usually ignore which version of the operating system your device is running, you may want to have that information available just in case you do need it.", "authors": ["Barbara Krasnoff", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OIbo1BjmK9imVnHwEdbNLh9xw9w=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19138755/vpavic_190731_3630_0080_result.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
