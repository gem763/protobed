But while she may not yet have the Olympic title to match them, Johnson-Thompson is now, statistically at least, better than they ever were. Holding the British record carries considerable weight in the heptathlon world and the hugs and celebrations between the trio were plentiful.\n\nEarlier this year, Johnson-Thompson had admitted to suffering from imposter syndrome, a feeling of chronic self-doubt that she was not worthy of her place at the top table. Here, standing alongside two of the all-time greats as equals, she belonged.\n\nAfter a sleepless night spent struggling to grasp the enormity of everything she had achieved, Johnson-Thompson offered an insight into just how much Ennis-Hill and Lewis had helped pave the way for her moment of redemption.\n\n\u201cI was there when Jess did that score in 2012 [to win Olympic gold],\u201d said Johnson-Thompson, who made her senior international debut at that London Games. \u201cI was watching it. And that inspired me so much.\u201d", "description": "A few hours after winning world heptathlon gold, Katarina Johnson-Thompson was heading for the Khalifa International Stadium exit when she bumped into two of her greatest sources of inspiration.", "authors": ["Ben Bloom", "Athletics Correspondent", "Oliver Brown", "Jim White"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/athletics/2019/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000211922381-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6W5U3i7aIsD-FFe7YFdv_ojm15J88rhg-q8ONtQG0Pg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
