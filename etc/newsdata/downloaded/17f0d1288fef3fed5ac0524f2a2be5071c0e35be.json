The names we give them are sometimes our own: Queen Anne\u2019s lace, from the last Stuart monarch of England; Good King Henry, from a German sovereign, not the ones celebrated by Shakespeare or Herman\u2019s Hermits. Other flower names belonged to botanists who described or grew them: monarda (from Nicol\u00e1s Monardes, a 16th-century Spaniard who wrote about New World plants), forsythia (from William Forsyth, who tended George III\u2019s gardens). Who gave his name to Joe Pye weed?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is one of the late-summer flowers, only just now gone to sleep. It has a tall stalk, surmounted by a crown of small blossoms that is shaped like a shallow parachute. The color is pink with a lot of red in it. It grows, and glows, in clumps in marshes or roadside ditches \u2014 anywhere it can put down wet feet. We planted it a few years ago on a short slope behind a stone wall in a patch of ironweed and jewelweed; it liked the spot, for it has spread. At season\u2019s end it attracts butterflies, fueling for the flight to Mexico before the frost deadline. In a wet summer with no real scorchers, its blossoms last a long time.\n\nThe name is notably simple. No crowned head here. Weeds are for commoners. Joseph was the odd man out in the holy family; \u201cjoe\u201d is what we call diner coffee. And \u201cPye\u201d \u2014 did someone mean pie, to go with the joe? \u2014 adds a note of the ludicrous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHerbalists used the flowers and leaves as a diuretic, or tea made from the leaves and roots to bring down fever. Herbal books attribute knowledge of the last quality to an Indian, Joe Pye, who shared it with Pilgrims or Puritans in 17th-century Massachusetts.\n\nThis is the most common account of how the weed got its name. It encapsulates an old (white) American myth, the helpful red man, which lasted as late as Tonto, and was sometimes even true (Pocahontas, Squanto). Like many myths, that of Joe Pye the Indian herbalist has variations. Some versions trace him to Maine, western New England, or even the Carolinas. If he actually existed in all or some of these places, then perhaps he was a traveling herbalist \u2014 or possibly a white patent-medicine salesman of the 19th century, a type that often claimed knowledge of Indian lore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017 two scholars, Richard B. Pearce and James S. Pringle, got to the bottom of all this in an article published in The Great Lakes Botanist. They added one more variation of the legendary account, from a 20th-century Indian herbalist and storyteller. The Joe Pye of this version, because he shared his knowledge with white people, was forbidden to accompany his tribe when they moved west to Wisconsin. But he gave his grandchildren the seeds of the weed so that in the next life he could follow the plants to their destination. Then the authors got down to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name \u201cJoe Pye weed\u201d is first found in the botany manuals of Amos Eaton, which began appearing in 1818. Eaton said the plant was in common medical use \u201cin the western counties of Massachusetts.\u201d Zephaniah Moore, president of Williams College, cured himself of a \u201cvery alarming fever\u201d by drinking Joe Pye weed tea. Pearce and Pringle then looked for an Indian Joe Pye in the neighborhood, and found one. Joseph Pye, or Joseph Shauqueathquat, was a Mohican, born in 1722 in New York. Like many Christian Indians, he had a biblical first name, a native surname, and an alternative white surname, for ease of communicating with palefaces. In the 1730s and \u201940s, his tribe, decimated by war and disease, moved to Stockbridge, a town in western Massachusetts reserved by the colony for Indians. He left a long paper trail. He appears in the diary of Samson Occom, an Indian evangelist who helped raise money for what became Dartmouth College (the two engaged in \u201cheart exercises\u201d \u2014 not cardio, but prayers). Joseph\u2019s name appears in legal documents \u2014 witnessing a land transfer, owing money to a tavern keeper. He also became a selectman of the town of Stockbridge, and chief sachem of the local Mohicans. He and they sided with the Americans in the Revolution; when they moved back to New York after the war, they carried a certificate from George Washington, testifying that they had \u201cfought and bled by our side\u201d and should be considered \u201cfriends and subjects to the United States.\u201d\n\nFriendship, even Washington\u2019s, did not guarantee stability. Pressure from their white neighbors kept pushing all Indians, including the Mohicans, farther west. Sometimes the pressure was merely demographic, sometimes it was actively avaricious: Encouraging Indians to run up debts, then seizing their land in payment, was a common tactic (cf. Joseph\u2019s debt to the tavern keeper; liquor also frequently played a role, the addict\u2019s downfall, the con man\u2019s tool). At the end of Joseph\u2019s life he was negotiating with natives in Indiana for a new homeland there; the battle of Tippecanoe would block that plan. By then Pye/Shauqueathquat was dead; the last we hear of him is in 1809.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPearce and Pringle nail down every detail except one: There is no mention of Joseph\u2019s being an herbalist. Samson Occom was, but he left no account of professional consultations with his Mohican acquaintance. The best they offer is surmise: Joseph\u2019s people lived in Stockbridge; some or one of them (possibly Joseph himself) said they used the plant, or were observed using it. Since Pye/Shauqueathquat was their leader, his name got attached to it. The four-decade gap between their departure for New York and Amos Eaton\u2019s descriptions would add just the necessary touch of nostalgia. America was ready for it; James Fenimore Cooper\u2019s Last of the Mohicans would be published in 1826.\n\nNow the last of the Mohican\u2019s flowers have faded behind my stone wall, to await their darkly burning return.", "description": "Contemplating the native plant Joe Pye weed, its origin, its name, its uses, its beauty.", "authors": ["Richard Brookhiser", "Kyle Smith", "Kevin D.
