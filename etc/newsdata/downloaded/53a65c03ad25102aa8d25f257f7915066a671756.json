As we've been suggesting, the global markets continue to be news-driven and are seeking any positive news related to easing trade tensions and capital markets. We believe any US/China trade deal would be received as very positive news by the global capital markets \u2013 yet we understand the process of achieving the components of the \u201cdeal\u201d would likely still be 6 to 24 months away.\n\nStill, with the strength of the US economy and the potential that some deal could be reached before the end of 2019 setting positive expectations, the US stock market and major indexes rallied last Thursday and Friday (October 10 and 11). As the long holiday weekend sets up with no trading on Monday, it will be interesting to see what is potentially resolved between President Trump and the Chinese before the markets start to react on Sunday and Monday nights.\n\nOur research team wanted to highlight some very key elements related to technical price theory and technical analysis. These weekly charts highlight what we believe is \u201ckey resistance\u201d in the US major indexes and share our research team's concern that the markets may be reacting to news more than relying on fundamental economic and earnings valuations. In past articles, we've highlighted how a \u201ccapital shift\u201d is continuing to take place where foreign capital is actively seeking safety and security for future returns. This leads to a shift in how capital is being deployed throughout the globe.\n\nThe current price channels in these weekly charts highlight two key facets of the current market setup. Either the US stock market will attempt to rally above this lower yellow price channel and attempt to regain strength between the two yellow price channels, or it will fail near the current price level and attempt to identify new support somewhere below the current price rotation ranges.\n\nJust a few days ago, we posted this research article to alert traders of the Pennant/Flag formation that is setting up in the US markets:\n\nOctober 7, 2019: US STOCK MARKETS TRADE SIDEWAYS \u2013 WAITING ON NEWS/GUIDANCE\n\nWith the holiday weekend upon us, we believe the news and economic data will continue to drive the market's future moves and that volatility will continue to increase.\n\nWeekly Emini S&P 500\n\nThis chart highlights a similar setup, yet one key fact must be understood. Price has already fallen away from the lower YELLOW price channel level and established a \u201clower high\u201d price rotation recently. Any price rally failure near this level may prompt a very big downside move. The price must continue to rally above 3100 is price makes any attempt at further gains.\n\nWeekly Nasdaq\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nWe believe skilled technical traders have already digested and are well aware of the risks that are present in the current market environment. We've been urging our followers to stay mostly in cash and to consider very strategic, expertly timed, investments when price trends are relatively secure.\n\nThis is not a speculative market any longer \u2013 this is a very volatile and uncertain market that is currently resting as major resistance levels. Don't get overly aggressive at this point. It is better for the markets to tell us what it wants to do. Lower risk, lower chance of disaster and live to trade another day \u2013 these should be hammered into the heads of traders at this stage of the markets.\n\nOur morning coffee video analysis recap is the one thing\u2026 that single investment that\u2019s going to turn into the greatest investment you\u2019ve ever made for your trading.\n\nAs a technical analysis and trader since 1997, I have been through a few bull/bear market cycles. I believe I have a good pulse on the market and timing key turning points for both short-term swing trading and long-term investment capital. The opportunities are massive/life-changing if handled properly.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Chris Vermeulen covering: Nasdaq 100, S&P 500 Futures.
