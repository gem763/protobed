But wallabies are something like kangaroos, and so it may seem a sad coincidence that a wallaby died at the National Zoo during the Australian prime minister\u2019s visit to Washington.\n\nA Bennett\u2019s wallaby, which is sometimes called a red-necked wallaby, was euthanized Friday, after it was discovered that he had an inoperable mass in his stomach, the zoo said. It had caused weight loss and a lack of appetite, according to a statement from the zoo. His prognosis was poor, and his quality of life was in rapid decline, the zoo said.\n\nThe wallaby was named Sydney after the Australian city.\n\nFriday, the day Sydney died, was the day of a state dinner at the White House held for Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.\n\nSydney was 3 years old, and a good companion to the three others with whom he shared quarters, the zoo said.\n\nHe was the father of one of them, the zoo said, a female named Lenah. Two adult female wallabies in the group are named Victoria, an Australian state, and Adelaide, the name of an Australian city.\n\nAccording to the zoo, Bennett\u2019s wallabies are native to Australia\u2019s eastern coast, parts of South Australia and Tasmania.\n\nWallabies share some kangaroo characteristics, such as the pouches in which females keep newborns. But wallabies are smaller than kangaroos.", "description": "A Bennett\u2019s wallaby, named Sydney, died at National Zoo on Friday, zoo said.", "authors": ["Martin Weil", "Local Reporter", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
