You want to sleep feeling cool, but you don\u2019t want to feel exposed by ditching your comforter in favor of an unsatisfying single sheet draped over you.\n\nAnd, if you\u2019ve been on Instagram recently, you may have seen a potential solution filling up your feed with sponsored posts - the Buffy Breeze comforter.\n\nTheir main product is the Cloud Comforter, a \u201csuper soft, super fluffy\u201d year-round option which arrived when Buffy launched in 2017.\n\nBut they also now ship the Breeze Comforter, an \u201cultra-breathable, eucalyptus comforter\u201d which is designed for the warmer months and people who run hot.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about it:\n\nIt arrives in a compact, elegantly designed box.\n\nIt\u2019s a high-end product, and packaging is part of the experience. The comforters at my local homeware store come shrink-wrapped in clear plastic. In comparison, this felt packaged up like an Apple product.\n\nIt\u2019s soft and thin\n\nIt fits in such a compact box because it\u2019s pretty thin. But it\u2019s also soft and squishy and feels evenly filled. So far, it hasn't lost it\u2019s shape the way similarly sized comforters can.\n\nIt does what it promises\n\nI run at a pretty normal temperature. My girlfriend doesn\u2019t. Unless the AC in our New York apartment is cranked to the max, she\u2019s too hot.\n\nThe bedroom must feel like a meat locker for her to be able to sleep, which means chattering teeth for me.\n\nOn night one of using the Buffy comforter, this changed. The cold air from the AC almost feels like it permeates the comforter, and at one point, she reached over to turn off the AC during the night.\n\nThere are pros other than its coolness\n\nBecause it\u2019s filled with eucalyptus fiber instead of down, it protects 12 geese from live-plucking and is naturally hypoallergenic.\n\nEucalyptus fiber is also biodegradable and uses less water and land to produce than cotton, so it\u2019s an environmentally friendly option.\n\nIt\u2019s a little difficult to wash\n\nBuffy doesn\u2019t recommend regular machine washing, so instead it needs to be dry cleaned. Some people online report unsightly bunching when machine washed, so best not to try it.\n\nIt\u2019s expensive\n\nNone of this comes cheaply - the comforter for my Queen-sized bed cost $220, and a king-size comforter will cost $260.\n\nOur verdict\n\nThis may seem like a crazy amount of money to spend on a comforter when you can pick up a serviceable one for $25.\n\nBut for anyone who prioritises quality of sleep and typically runs hot, this is a splurge-worthy product that they should definitely consider.\n\nYou can purchase the Buffy Breeze here.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
