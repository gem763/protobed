In the process, he pocketed over a billion dollars. Making a billion dollars is by all accounts pretty cool. But demolishing the monetary system of Great Britain in a single day with an elegantly constructed bet against its currency? That\u2019s the stuff of legends.\n\nThough it occurred just two decades ago, Soros made his nation-shaking bet in a very different time. Back then, hedge funds hadn\u2019t yet entered the public consciousness, restrictions on capital flowing from one country to another were just lifted, and the era of the 24-hour news cycle had just begun.\n\nTo appreciate how Soros made a fortune betting against the British pound requires some knowledge of how exchange rates between countries work, the macroeconomic tools governments use to stimulate economies, and how hedge funds make money. Our readers are invited to correct us if we stumble in explaining any of these concepts.\n\nAnd so onwards with the story of how George Soros led a group of traders to break the entire foreign currency system of Great Britain\u2014and profit handsomely at the expense of British taxpayers and others who were on the wrong side of the greatest financial bet of the 20th century.\n\nPicking Up the Pieces in Europe\n\nLet\u2019s start by laying out the historical backdrop for Soros\u2019 gambit. After Word War II, European countries wanted to integrate their economies more tightly with each other. The hope was that tighter relations would prevent catastrophic wars from breaking out every few decades and create a Pan-European market that could compete with the United States. This culminated in the European Union (EU), which didn\u2019t assume its current form with a single currency until 1999.\n\nA precursor to the EU was the European Exchange Rate mechanism (ERM), which was created in 1979. Countries weren\u2019t ready to give up their national currencies, but they agreed to fix their exchange rates with each other instead of \u201cfloating\u201d their currency and letting capital markets set the rates. Since Germany had the strongest economy in Europe, each country set their currency\u2019s value in Deutschmarks. They agreed to maintain the exchange rate between their currency and the Deutschmark within an acceptable band of plus or minus 6% of the agreed upon rate.\n\nWith fixed exchange rates, countries can\u2019t just \u201cset it and forget it.\u201d People trade currency every day, exchanging their currency to buy imports or sell exports, and the market applies pressure based on what it thinks the actual rate should be based on supply and demand for a currency. To keep the exchange rate fixed, governments need to participate in the market and nudge it in the agreed upon direction.\n\nGovernments can manage their currency in two main ways. First, they can take their reserves of foreign currency and buy up their own currency on the open market. That causes the currency to appreciate. Doing the opposite devalues the currency.\n\nAlternatively, governments can influence exchange rates by setting interest rates. Want your currency to appreciate? Raise rates to entice people to buy your currency and lend that money at higher interest rates. Want your currency to depreciate? Cut interest rates so capital needs to go elsewhere in search of juicy profits.\n\nMessing around with interest rates is a big deal, however, because interest rates affect the whole economy. Along with government spending, interest rates are the main lever governments can use to adjust the economy. If the country is experiencing a recession, the government might cut interest rates to spur investment and spending. If inflation is high, the government might raise rates to shrink the supply of money.\n\nSo, all this is to say that there are consequences to maintaining a fixed exchange rate. It\u2019s an external forcing function that ties governments\u2019 hands on monetary policy, which may limit or even contradict what they need to do to keep the domestic economy healthy.\n\nBritain Enters the ERM\n\nJohn Major, leading proponent of ERM while serving under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Major was Prime Minister when the chickens came home to roost, so to speak.\n\nIn 1990, Britain was a country that arguably could use an external forcing function to tie its hands on monetary policy. Inflation was high, productivity was low, exports were uncompetitive, and no one really believed the government was capable of fixing the issues.\n\nThe Prime Minister at the time, Margaret Thatcher, had long opposed entering the ERM, insisting that the price of the pound be set by the markets. By 1990, however, Thatcher lacked the political power to oppose other members of her Conservative party who wanted to fix their exchange rates with the rest of Europe.\n\nThe decision to join the ERM was championed by John Major, who was the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Thatcher\u2019s cabinet. In October 1990, Britain finally enter the ERM at an exchange rate of 2.95 Deutschmark (DM) for each British pound (GBP). The British government was obligated to keep the exchange rate within 2.78 DM to 3.13 DM.\n\nShortly thereafter, Major replaced Thatcher as the Prime Minister. The fixed exchange rate system was to be the centerpiece of his economic plan. Major thought that the ERM would serve as a sort of \u201cautopilot\u201d that kept the British monetary policy on proper course. The government couldn\u2019t play with the money supply willy-nilly because its hands were tied by the exchange rate agreement.\n\nAnd to a certain extent, the policy worked. Between 1990 and 1992, inflation decreased, interest rates eased, and unemployment was low by historical standards. In 1992, however, England felt the impact of a massive global recession, and unemployment spiked to 12.7% from just 7.7% two years prior.\n\nAnd so we come to 1992. Ordinarily, Britain could spur investment and spending by cutting interest rates during an employment crisis. But in this case, doing so would push the pound\u2019s value below the agreed upon amount. So while the people of Great Britain dealt with a recession, the government\u2019s hands were tied; they\u2019d just have to ride it out.\n\nMeanwhile in New York City\n\nIn 1992, George Soros was 62 years old and led the Quantum Fund, a hedge fund he founded in 1970 that bet on macroeconomic trends. Soros was already a very rich guy, but he wasn\u2019t iconically rich, or the public figure he is today.\n\nIf hedge funds have an air of mystery about them today, this was especially true in 1992\u2014it wasn\u2019t until then that the term even entered the popular vernacular.\n\nMention of the words \u201cHedge Fund\u201d by Year According to Google Books\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a hedge fund exactly? Well, the word \u201chedge\u201d provides a clue to their original purpose: investing capital to make a specific bet that something will happen. Hedge funds also use financial instruments to \u201chedge\u201d against other risks in order to more clearly isolate the bet that they want to make.\n\nHere\u2019s an example. Say you\u2019re a hedge fund that thinks AT&T\u2019s cell phone network stinks and you want to bet against it. You could \u201cshort\u201d the stock (make money when the stock goes down), but the whole cell phone market is going gangbusters, so AT&T might get new customers even though it stinks. If that happens, AT&T\u2019s stock price could go up, and you'd lose a lot of money. To \u201chedge\u201d against this risk, you buy some Verizon stock as well, because more precisely, you think that AT&T is crappy relative to Verizon.\n\nNow, if cell phone carrier stocks increase in value, you still make money in the event that Verizon goes up more than AT&T does. Conversely, if cell phone stocks go down, you still make money if AT&T\u2019s stock goes down faster than Verizon\u2019s does. By creating a position like this, you\u2019ve \u201chedged\u201d a lot of the more general market and industry risks away and made a very specific bet: that AT&T stinks compared to Verizon.\n\nAnother thing hedge funds do (if they\u2019re pretty sure about their wager) is borrow funds to put even more money behind the bet. On the AT&T-Verizon trade, they might make a little bit of money on each share. But if they use mostly borrowed money, they can buy a lot of shares without fronting much capital. So if you\u2019re really sure a bet is right, you might borrow a lot of money to enhance your payday.\n\nA final thing to note about hedge funds is how their managers get paid. The managers are typically investing other people\u2019s money (rich people, endowments, etc), and they receive management fees to cover the fund\u2019s expenses; this includes a salary. The standard is about 2% of the funds under management. So if you manage a very large hedge fund in terms of the amount of money being invested, you can earn some decent income regardless of how the fund performs. But not enough to make you a billionaire.\n\nHedge fund managers become billionaires by placing really successful bets. Managers earn around 20% of the returns that the fund creates (assuming the fund meets some minimum benchmark). So if your fund makes a bet that produces a billion dollar return, you and your partners make at least $200 million of that. Do that for a few years, especially if you place larger and larger bets, and voila! You\u2019re a billionaire.\n\nSo in short, hedge funds try to make isolated bets using financial instruments. They borrow money to make the potential rewards even sweeter, and hedge fund managers can make boatloads of money when they bet right. And that\u2019s exactly what Soros and his partners were about to do.\n\nA Mis-priced Currency Means Big Opportunity\n\nPhoto by deg.io\n\nBy the spring of 1992, just a year and a half after Britain joined the ERM, the fixed exchange rate posed a serious problem. While putting on a cheery public face, internally the Exchequer (England\u2019s Treasury department) realized that the currency was mispriced relative to the Deutschemark. Jonathan Portes, an economist who was at the time a junior staff member there, wrote:\n\n\"In May 1992, the immediate problem was obvious. From a domestic point of view, the appropriate level of interest rates, given weak demand, was much lower than that necessary to maintain [the] sterling's position in the ERM. Moreover, it was becoming increasingly clear that sterling was overvalued; even in the depths of a recession, we still had a large current account deficit [the country was importing more than it exported]. We argued that the fundamental problem was that we'd joined the ERM at the wrong rate; sterling was overvalued, meaning that we were stuck with a structural current account deficit.\"\n\nThe sterling was priced too high. The British government knew it, and the market knew it too as the pound was trading at the lower end of the agreed upon band with the Deutschemark.\n\nWhat kept the pound from plummeting in value was the British government\u2019s guarantee that it would keep the value propped up, and the market believed that it would. As long as everyone believed that England would stay indefinitely committed to buying pounds for around 2.95 Deutschemarks, the status quo was maintained.\n\nThe Flashpoint\n\n\u201cMarkets can influence the events that they anticipate.\u201d\n\n- George Soros\n\nThroughout the summer of 1992, the British pound held its position. That is, until Germany threw Britain under the bus and all hell broke loose.\n\nFor some time that year, German central bank officials made comments on and off the record that undermined the sterling\u2019s strength. The British paper The Independent documents the slights:\n\n\"On 25 August, for example, Reimut Jochimsen, a Bundesbank council member, issued a speech saying that there was potential for realignment within the ERM. Sterling weakened. On 10 September, an unnamed Bundesbank official was quoted as saying that a devaluation of sterling was inevitable. The pound fell.\"\n\nThe event that ultimately led to the undoing of the British pound\u2019s fixed exchange rate was an interview with the President of the German Bundesbank, Helmut Schlesinger. Schlesinger gave the interview to the Wall Street Journal and a German newspaper. He had one condition: If they wanted to directly quote him, they had to let him review the quotes. If they only indirectly paraphrased him, no such permission was necessary.\n\nPresident of the German Bundesbank, Helmut Schlesinger\n\nThat night on September 16th, 1992, the following report paraphrasing Schlesinger\u2019s words went out over the newswires:\n\n\"The President of the Bundesbank, Professor Helmut Schlesinger, does not rule out the possibility that, even after the realignment and the cut in German interest rates, one or two currencies could come under pressure before the referendum in France. He conceded in an interview that the problems are of course not solved completely by the measures taken.\"\n\nBy the morning, the report landed on George Soros\u2019 desk. Soros and the entire financial market took this to believe that the pound sterling was one of those currencies that could \u201ccome under pressure\u201d and be devalued.\n\nIn just one day, this seemingly innocuous, paraphrased quote would bring devastation to the Bank of England and net George Soros over a billion dollars in profit. The market ceased to believe that England would be able to maintain its current exchange rate\u2014and that belief was all that was keeping the pound from falling.\n\nThe Trade of the Century\n\n\u201cThere is no point in being confident and having a small position.\u201d\n\n- George Soros\n\nSince August, Soros and his Quantum Fund had been building a $1.5 billion position to bet that the price of Sterling would fall. Since the British government\u2019s full faith and credit was stating that it would not fall, this wasn\u2019t necessarily something that was going to happen. But Stanley Druckenmiller, a senior member of the fund, saw the report from Schlesinger and immediately realized its importance.\n\nSebastian Mallaby\u2019s book More Money Than God recounts the day\u2019s events. According to Mallaby, Druckenmiller noted that their $1.5 billion bet against the pound was about to pay off and that they should consider adding to the position.\n\nSoros retorted with a different strategy: \u201cGo for the jugular.\u201d\n\nIf Schlesinger\u2019s quote could be used as the catalyst for the pound to devalue, why shouldn\u2019t today be the day it happened? Instead of slowly building up a short position against the sterling, the Quantum Fund could short sell sterling on an unprecedented scale today. Doing so would not only help hasten the tumble of the sterling, but also increase the fund\u2019s profit.\n\nIt was this decision to \u201cgo for the jugular\u201d that netted Soros\u2019s firm over a billion dollars, toppled the Bank of England\u2019s currency regime, and ultimately led to the disgrace of the Prime Minister. It also cost the British taxpayers billions.\n\nThe man himself, George Soros. Picture from \"Charlie Rose\"; modified by Priceonomics.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through Soros\u2019s trade to understand why it was so elegant. As we stated earlier, the trade was for the Quantum Fund to \u201cshort\u201d the British pound, meaning they would make money if the currency\u2019s value went down.\n\nNow, what exactly does it mean to \u201cshort\u201d a currency, or anything for that matter? Let\u2019s say it\u2019s January 2009 and you think Apple\u2019s iPhone is over the hill and that the company\u2019s stock price (of $90) will decline. How do you benefit from this insight?\n\nWell, you or your broker can go to someone that owns some Apple stock and ask to borrow a single Apple stock from them. You\u2019ll give them back the share later and of course pay them interest for the loan. But for now, you sell that stock for $90 in cash. Two days later, the stock price is $88, so you buy one share with your $90 in cash. That leaves you with $2 in profit! (Well almost two dollars\u2014you have to pay the person who loaned you the stock two days of interest.)\n\nBut what if you didn\u2019t sell your Apple stock when it hit $88 and instead decided to hold onto it until the stock plummeted further? Well, you\u2019d be screwed because the stock went up from $90 to around $600; you would lose $510 on a the trade, plus interest!\n\nIf you buy a stock, the worst you can do is lose all your money. If you short a stock, your downside is limitless because the stock can always keep going up. You can possibly lose more than all your money, and that's a very bad thing. So if you take a short position, you want to make sure your downside risk is hedged.\n\nAnd what if you want to short a currency like the British pound? In this case, you\u2019d go to a British person or company and ask to borrow money from them. They say, \u201cSure, here\u2019s 100 British pounds. Just give me back the pounds in a few days with some interest, and we\u2019ll have some tea and crumpets.\u201d Now, you take those 100 British pounds, and you convert them into 295 Deutschemarks at the agreed upon exchange rate.\n\nAt this point, you would really like the British pound to lose value relative to the Deutschmark. Why? Because if the British pound depreciates 10%, when you convert the 295 DM back to pounds to repay the loan, you\u2019ll have 110 pounds. You can pay back the 100 pounds and a little bit of interest, and you\u2019ll still clear about 10 pounds in profit.\n\nSo you make money if the pound devalues. But what if the pound appreciates? You\u2019ll lose your shirt. Therein lies the brilliance of Soros\u2019s bet: if the pound tanked, they would make billions on their short. And if the pound increased in value? Well, that scenario was impossible because everyone knew the sterling was over priced. It already traded at the bottom of its trading band, and the only thing that kept it propped up was government intervention. There was no scenario in which the pound would appreciate.\n\nSo, either the pound would stay about the same in value (in which case Soros\u2019s fund wouldn\u2019t make any money, but wouldn\u2019t lose that much money), or the pound would be devalued and the firm would make an obscene amount of money. There was no massive downside\u2014only a massive upside.\n\nAs The Handbook of Hedge Funds puts it:\n\n\u201cIf speculators were to break the ERM, being short the pound could turn out to be a very profitable position. Even if the devaluation did not occur, the chances of seeing the pound strengthen were small -- it was more likely to stay at the bottom of its fluctuation band. The only downside for speculators was transaction costs.\"\n\nAnd so that morning, Soros and his fund increased their short position against the British pound from $1.5 to $10 billion. It was the perfect bet with a mitigated downside and a limitless upside. It was like betting on a coin flip, were if the coin lands on heads (the pound devalues), they make a lot of money. If the coin lands on tails (the exchange rates remained fixed), they only lose a small amount of money on loan interest. That\u2019s the kind of bet Soros would pour money into all the day, even if he had to borrow billions.\n\nFighting off the Speculators\n\n\"Our total position by Black Wednesday had to be worth almost $10 billion. We planned to sell more than that. In fact, when Norman Lamont [the British finance minister] said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly $15 billion to defend sterling, we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell.\"\n\n- George Soros, 1992\n\nAs Europe slept, Soros borrowed and sold pounds from anyone that he could. The Quantum Fund\u2019s position exceeded $10 billion shorting the pound. Other hedge funds got wind of the trade (and the report from the Bundesbank) and started following suit, also borrowing and selling pounds.\n\nBy the time London markets opened for business and British treasury officials started their day, tens of billions of pounds had been sold. The pound was dangerously close to trading below the levels mandated by the ERM.\n\nThe Bank of England was about to have a very shitty day.\n\nBritish officials first responded by buying one billion pounds at 8:40 AM. The purchase had no effect on the price of the pound. The whole world was selling, and the British government didn\u2019t have the buying power to fight it all off. It\u2019s estimated that the British government spent \u00a327 billion of its reserves buying up pounds to no avail.\n\nBy 9AM, finance minister Norman Lamont contacted Prime Minister John Major and told him they couldn\u2019t possibly buy up enough pounds to keep the currency propped up. The only option left for the British government to keep their currency trading at the right level would be to increase interest rates dramatically and attract people to buy pounds. Major refused. Britain was in the midst of a recession, and increasing rates would further shrink the economy. It would be political suicide.\n\nBlood was in the water. Global capital continued to bet against the pound. An hour and a half later, Lamont called the Prime Minister to re-plead his case. The Prime Minister relented. At 11AM, the British government announced they would increase interest rates 200 basis points, from 10% to 12%.\n\nHow did the value of the pound react to this enormous increase in interest rates? Nothing happened. The pound continued to plummet. Lamont headed to the Prime Minister's residence to figure out how to salvage the situation, which led them to announce an interest rate increase of another 300 basis points, from 12% to 15%.\n\nWhat was the effect of this rate increase on the sterling? Again, nothing. As Mallaby later documents in his book, Soros and the gang of speculators knew victory was near:\n\n\"At their desks on the other side of the Atlantic, Druckenmiller and Soros saw the rate hikes as an act of desperation by a dying man. They were a signal that the end was nigh--and that it was time for one last push to sell the life out of the British currency.\"\n\nThe market expected that Britain would have to devalue its currency and that no amount of interest rate hikes or currency purchasing would change that. At this point, the sentiment that Britain would exit the ERM and devalue its currency was a self-fulfilling prophecy; if the speculators believed it enough to put their money behind it, it would eventually come true.\n\nAt 7:30 PM that night, Lamont held a news conference to announce that Britain would be exiting the ERM and floating its currency on the market. Soros and the speculators won.\n\nThe Aftermath of Black Wednesday\n\nBritish financial history now refers to September 17, 1992, as \"Black Wednesday;\" George Soros, however, probably calls it something like \"Awesome Wednesday.\" Once Great Britain floated its currency, the pound fell 15% versus the Deutschmark and 25% versus the US Dollar.\n\nIf you\u2019ll remember, Soros\u2019s Quantum Fund had approximately $15 billion betting that the pound would fall versus other currencies. They had borrowed billions to make this trade, and they were right. Here\u2019s what happened to the value of their fund versus the price of the pound:\n\nThe value of the fund increased almost instantly from $15BN to $19BN when the pound floated; a few months later, the fund was worth almost $22 BN. Remember, this is a hedge fund, so Soros and his partners made at least 20% of that $7 billion upside, which is at least $1.4BN. And that, my friends, is how you become a billionaire.\n\nThe nature of Wall Street trading is that if you win big, someone else must lose big. In this case, there was an enormous wealth transfer from the British taxpayers to Soros and other hedge fund managers. The Guardian recounts:\n\n\"Jim Trott, former chief dealer for the Bank of England, described the day as \"stunningly expensive\". He said that behind the scenes he bought more sterling in four hours that day than anybody had before or since. All of his purchases lost value during the day \u2013 and went down even more when the government pulled out.\"\n\nIn the run up to the devaluation, the British Treasury kept spending its foreign currency on British pounds that become much less valuable after the Treasury floated the exchange rate. To maintain the fiction that the pound was properly priced, it essentially paid a dollar for something everyone knew was going to be worth three quarters. The cost to British taxpayers was estimated at roughly \u00a33.3 billion.\n\nLosing billions of dollars of taxpayer money is so routine for politicians that they may not lose any sleep over the matter. They do, however, care about the political implications of publicly looking like a bunch of incompetents. You can\u2019t make multiple announcements in a single day that you\u2019re massively hiking interest rates in the middle of a recession or completely changing how foreign currency works without giving everyone the impression that you have no idea what you\u2019re doing.\n\nJohn Major had made entering the ERM the centerpiece of his monetary policy and his plan to bring austerity to England. The events destroyed his credibility. Voters booted Major and his party from power in the next election. As it turns out, Margaret Thatcher was right: the UK had no business trying to artificially prop up its currency in an era when a handful of hedge funds could assemble more capital in a few hours than the Bank of England had at its disposal.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a take away from this story, that\u2019s one of them. The amount of money sloshing around global markets is so enormous that it can bring even the British government to its knees in one day. Another takeaway is that regulations like this can create unexpected loopholes, and someone more clever than the politicians will eventually spot it.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, this story shows the power of the one-sided bet. In 1992, the bet was a well-designed macroeconomic trade against fixed exchange rates, executed by George Soros and his team. If they were wrong, the downside was almost zero. But they were right, and the upside was unfathomably high.\n\nBets like that almost never come along, but when they do, enormous transfers of wealth take place from the sheep to the wolves.\n\nOur next article examines the decision of the San Francisco School District to eliminate algebra from middle schools\u2014and the freakout that followed.
