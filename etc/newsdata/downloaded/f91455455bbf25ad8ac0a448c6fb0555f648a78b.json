Mr. Allen, who has been CEO for a decade, will remain chairman. The transition has been expected by industry analysts, investors and employees since Mr. May\u2019s promotion to COO in April.\n\nShares in Deere were up 2.46% to close at $156.48.\n\nMr. May, 50 years old, will take the helm of a company that has been backing away from aggressive global sales goals that Mr. Allen set early in his tenure. Mr. Allen, 66, had aimed for annual sales of Deere\u2019s tractors, combines and other machinery to hit $50 billion through rapid growth to farmers in big emerging markets including China, India and Brazil. Each of those economies has cooled recently. Deere\u2019s total sales last year were $37.3 billion. Equipment-industry analysts say Deere appears focused on reducing costs and using new technology to drive equipment sales in established markets like North America, where Deere commands 60% of the market for high-horsepower tractors. \u201cThey are going to stop chasing revenue,\u201d said Rob Wertheimer, founding partner of Melius Research. \u201cThis is the turning of an era.\u201d Mr. Allen was promoted to chief executive in April 2009 and oversaw one of the largest expansions of farm-equipment sales in the company\u2019s 182-year history. But Deere struggled in the second half of his tenure with rising farm debt, falling farm incomes and trade tensions that have choked off U.S. exports to China in the past year. Falling prices for crops and livestock in recent years have weighed on machinery sales. Deere earlier this month trimmed its forecast for this year and reported quarterly sales of its farm equipment were 6% below the same period last year. Mr. May joined Deere 22 years ago and moved into the senior management team in 2012 as president of agricultural solutions and chief information officer. He managed Deere\u2019s $305 million acquisition of Blue River Technology in 2017. The Silicon Valley company provided Deere with the foundation to offer customers machine-learning capabilities for applying herbicide to farm fields. Deere is working on sprayers that can distinguish weeds from crops when applying herbicide to fields, technology that Deere says would help farmers cut costs.
