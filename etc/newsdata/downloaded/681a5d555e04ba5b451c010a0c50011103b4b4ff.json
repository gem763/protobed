The Hawkeyes (1-0 Big Ten) have looked like the kind of team that can go on such a run again this fall, thanks to a defense that\u2019s allowing just 10.3 points per game and a quarterback, senior Nate Stanley, who has yet to throw an interception this season.\n\nInjuries, especially in the secondary, could be a reason for caution.\n\n\u201cWe have got a lot of guys out. It\u2019s concerning every week. It was extremely concerning the last time we played,\u201d Ferentz said. \u201cI looked over (on Tuesday), half our two-deep in the secondary is in street clothes watching practice.\u201d\n\nBanged up or not, Iowa is a 24-point favorite over a team that has beaten five Power Five opponents since 2008.\n\nSCOUTING THE BLUE RAIDERS\n\nQuarterback Asher O\u2019Hara has been a pleasant surprise for Middle Tennessee. The first-year starter is averaging 267 yards passing a game, with eight touchdowns and just two interceptions. O\u2019Hara has also been the Blue Raiders\u2019 top rushing threat with 202 yards.\n\n\u201cWhen quarterbacks break contain, bad things tend to happen. He\u2019s got that ability,\u201d Ferentz said of O\u2019Hara. A \u201cbig part of our success will be trying to keep him in a position maybe where, we\u2019ve got him contained a little bit knowing he\u2019s going to get his completions.\u201d\n\nIOWA\u2019S OFFENSE\n\nExpect Iowa to try to push Middle Tennessee with its powerful line and running backs Mekhi Sargent and Toren Young, who have combined for 328 yards and 5.3 yards per carry.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to want to establish the run . and their defense is physical, big up front and talented on the back end,\u201d MTSU coach Rick Stockstill said.\n\nTHE DEFENSES\n\nThe Hawkeyes are seventh nationally in scoring defense and 12th in yards allowed at just 262.7 per game. Middle Tennessee allowed 40 to Michigan and 41 to Duke. Iowa also allowed just five first downs in its Big Ten opener, a 30-0 blowout of Rutgers. But the Hawkeyes are relying on backups D.J. Johnson (cornerback) and Jack Koerner (free safety) because of injuries.\n\nEXTRA POINTS\n\nMiddle Tennessee is 33-15 in league play since joining Conference USA. \u2026Iowa has intercepted a national-high 44 passes since the start of 2017. Boston College is second with 43. \u2026MTSU hasn\u2019t had a losing season since 2011. \u2026The Hawkeyes have scored in all 12 quarters this season. \u2026Middle Tennessee is 0-9 against ranked teams under Stockstill, now in his 14th season. \u2026Iowa last failed to win at least 10 games after a 4-0 start in 2006. The Hawkeyes stuck with injured quarterback Drew Tate almost all season and finished 6-7.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, if you\u2019re not at your best week in and week out, you just open yourself up to being in a world of trouble. That\u2019s certainly not anywhere we want to find ourselves.\u201d - Ferentz.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With a win over Middle Tennessee State on Saturday, No. 14 Iowa will move to 4-0 for the fifth time in coach Kirk Ferentz's 21 seasons in charge.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Luke Meredith"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/aptopix_iowa_iowa_st_football_07380_c0-172-4108-2567_s1770x1032.jpg?5178233c125e3788f8a7e476d2bd77524fa6cdcf", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
