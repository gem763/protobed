But they always fix the pothole,\" he told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi.\n\n\"I must have done this in about 50 potholes and the civic authorities have responded by fixing most of them,\" he added.\n\nHowever, he tweeted his gratitude when the latest potholes he identified were paved over by authorities.\n\nThis isn't the first time Nanjundaswamy's art has made national and international headlines.\n\nIn 2015, he filled a pothole with a life-size \"crocodile\", turning the 3.7m (12ft) waterlogged hole into a mock pond, which immediately caught the attention of the authorities.\n\nThe project cost him about 6,000 rupees ($83; \u00a368).\n\n\"Getting potholes filled up is not a hobby for him,\" Anatha Subrahmanyam, his friend and a photojournalist at the Bangalore Mirror, said.\n\n\"It is his way of giving something back to society.\"", "description": "Officials were spurred to act after an artist's innovative video calling attention to potholes went viral.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07m99st.jpg"}
