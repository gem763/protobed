People didn\u2019t talk to us or about our issues, and yet we were being blamed for not voting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThirteen months before the next presidential election, national Democratic leaders are once again talking about black voter turnout. But in battleground states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan \u2014 which all flipped to vote for Trump after decades of backing the Democratic presidential nominee \u2014 the task of doing something about it has often fallen on local activists like Lang.\n\nWith the help of local lawmakers and union organizers, Lang launched Black Leaders Organizing for Communities (BLOC) in November 2017 to focus on voters in Milwaukee\u2019s most impoverished neighborhoods, places where paid canvassers for campaigns often don\u2019t go because they deem it too dangerous or because many residents, with criminal records, are not eligible to vote. Persuading those who are eligible to participate in elections often requires addressing decades of neglect.\n\nMany have lost faith in the government and elected leaders after watching their communities be torn apart by mass incarceration, police brutality, lopsided city budgets, struggling public schools, pothole-filled streets, untreated addiction and gun violence \u2014 problems that have long existed and that continue to fester as elected leaders come and go, Lang said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe reasons for the decline in voting in 2016 may have been many, including the state\u2019s voter ID law, which went into effect that year. But the impact was undeniable: The turnout rate for black voters in Wisconsin fell nearly 19 percentage points between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections, while white turnout dropped only two points, according to a study by the Center for American Progress. Seven in 10 black Wisconsin residents live in Milwaukee County.\n\nIncreasing voter turnout requires convincing people that their votes will make a difference and that it does matter who gets elected. Lang\u2019s group is making a bet that, contrary to the view that voters are drawn in or repelled by the top of the ticket, organizers can spark excitement about the stakes involved in races that are closer to the bottom of the ballot.\n\nUsing money from a liberal advocacy group and a political action committee funded by labor unions, Lang nearly two years ago hired her first team of \u201cambassadors\u201d who walked from door to door in Milwaukee\u2019s 53206 Zip code, where about 95 percent of residents are African American, the highest percentage in the state . They asked a simple question: What needs to happen for your neighborhood to thrive?\n\nDaris Randolph, 52, walked through the Martin Drive neighborhood on Milwaukee\u2019s west side, where he rents a house. Unlike in neighborhoods to its east, many who live here are homeowners who are more likely to vote, but might still feel forgotten by elected leaders and fed up with the lack of change.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTwenty years ago, when Randolph was in his early 30s, he was caught with drugs, convicted of a felony and locked up for nearly a year. \u201cI became the example,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the years since, he has helped to raise his 11 children, coached basketball, volunteered for the Salvation Army and worked as a youth director for inner-city programs.\n\nAs Randolph walked, he explained recently introduced state legislation that, if passed and signed by the new Democratic governor, Tony Evers, would allow those on probation or parole to vote. Wisconsin is one of 19 states that don\u2019t allow those on probation or parole \u2014 the euphemism is \u201con paper\u201d\u2014 to vote, in addition to revoking the voting rights of those who are imprisoned.\n\nAD\n\nWisconsin has one of the highest incarceration rates for African American men in the nation. As of June, roughly 64,000 people in the state were on extended supervision or probation and not allowed to vote \u2014 nearly three times the narrow margin by which Trump won the state.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is a very important law that we\u2019re trying to get passed, because I used to be on paper, and I couldn\u2019t vote,\u201d Randolph said, as he chatted with his next-door neighbor, who nodded in agreement and said, \u201cYou and me both.\u201d\n\nAcross the street, Randolph gave the same pitch to James Barlow, 67, as he sat on his front stoop, enjoying the sunny evening.\n\n\u201cIf you lock people up, they can\u2019t vote,\u201d Barlow replied.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou already know how it goes,\u201d Randolph said.\n\nAs Randolph walked to the next house, Barlow turned to tell one of his relatives about the legislation. Randolph could hear his message spreading behind him.\n\nThe next morning, BLOC ambassadors met with activists from Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing, who opened by asking how many had been directly affected by incarceration. Every hand went up.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEverybody here,\u201d one young man in the audience said. Another echoed: \u201cEverybody.\u201d\n\nOne woman\u2019s son was recently charged with shooting at a police officer at a community event, a crime she\u2019s convinced he did not commit. An ambassador who was imprisoned years ago tried to keep his son out of the system, but the 20-year-old now has a felony record. One young woman grew up without her father, who was incarcerated \u2014 and soon after he was finally released, he was locked up again for something else. Two ambassadors are now in jail.\n\nAD\n\nBLOC ambassador Dawonyae Robinson, 20, is unable to vote because he\u2019s on probation. As he knocked on people\u2019s doors before the 2018 midterm elections, he told those who were eligible to vote that it was even more important for them to do so, because so many of their neighbors were denied the privilege.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t vote, so I needed them to vote. I was trying to get them to realize how much the percentage of people that don\u2019t vote makes a difference compared to the percentage of people who do vote,\u201d said Robinson, whose mother and several of his siblings are also involved with BLOC. \u201cEvery little vote counts.\u201d\n\nBLOC\u2019s first meeting with a Democratic presidential candidate came in March, when Beto O\u2019Rourke stopped by during the initial week of his campaign. Although the former congressman from El Paso spoke passionately about wanting to wipe out systemic racism and \u201crepair the in\u00adcred\u00adibly broken system of justice and opportunity in this country,\u201d the ambassadors repeatedly cut him off and asked for evidence that he has spent time in neighborhoods like theirs and truly understands their problems.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy, but he\u2019s just now doing his research on us,\u201d said Tamer Malone, 21, who didn\u2019t vote in the 2016 election and grilled O\u2019Rourke, asking why she should trust him when so many white politicians tell black voters all the right things while running for office, then \u201cturn their back\u201d once elected.\n\nIn April, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) arrived for what was supposed to be a \u201csilent canvas\u201d \u2014 an opportunity for the candidate to listen as the activists knocked on doors and talked with people. But he loudly talked throughout, often running ahead of the BLOC staffer and shouting, \u201cThis is Rick, I\u2019m Cory, we\u2019re here with BLOC.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was like running to the next door, trying to get to as many as possible, and he was always talking \u2026 I was like, \u2018Dude, stop,\u2019 \u201d said Rick Banks, 28, BLOC\u2019s political director, who canvassed with Booker. \u201cHe keeps saying that he\u2019s the only presidential candidate who\u2019s from the inner city, but it\u2019s usually only in terms of crime and guns and things like that. In terms of other issues, like investment in underinvested communities, and really being vocal about the issues that are affecting black communities, other than shootings, I don\u2019t think he has led \u2014 and I can honestly say the same about Kamala Harris,\u201d the Democratic senator from California.\n\nBanks voted for Green Party nominee Jill Stein in 2016 because he assumed that Hillary Clinton would easily win the election. He considered Clinton a \u201cwar hawk\u201d and didn\u2019t like that she had described inner-city kids as \u201csuper predators\u201d in a 1996 speech as first lady. Although Banks was working as a neighborhood organizer at the time, he said no one from her campaign ever reached out to him. Looking back, he said, he should have voted for Clinton.\n\nIn July, Banks went canvassing with Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former San Antonio mayor who was housing secretary during the Obama administration. Unlike Booker, Castro quietly followed and listened as Banks worked \u2014 and in between houses, the two talked about their personal experiences and what it will take to make such neighborhoods thrive. Castro first reached out to BLOC not to arrange a visit but to get the group\u2019s input as he composed his criminal justice platform \u2014 making him the only presidential candidate so far to ask BLOC for policy advice.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe reminds me of myself,\u201d Banks said. Malone, one of the ambassadors, added, \u201cHe\u2019s not just saying it, he has experienced it.\u201d\n\nCastro is the favorite candidate of many of the ambassadors, although most say they doubt he has a real shot at winning the nomination. They also like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), whom Lang met at a private gathering the senator had with organizers from across the country. Former vice president Joe Biden has not shown up, but his authorship of the 1994 crime bill, which led to sharp increases in incarcerations, has made him an unpopular figure with most of the activists.\n\nLast month, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) stopped by for about 30 minutes to tout her ideas for increasing access to voting. She took a couple of questions from the group, whose members asked about her time as a prosecutor and pushed her for details on how she would help the poor, not just the middle class. Her brief appearance angered several of the ambassadors, and none of the 16 listed her as their favorite candidate.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe kept talking about the middle class, the middle class, the middle class \u2014 what about the underclass?\u201d asked Randolph, who likes Warren and Biden. \u201cI hear about the middle class, what about the underclass? They exist, too. They\u2019ve just been forgotten, and that\u2019s sad.\u201d\n\nLang has personally endorsed Castro, although the group as a whole is unsure if it will endorse in the Democratic presidential primary. Several ambassadors said they have yet to find any presidential candidate who appeals to them. Robinson said he hasn\u2019t heard enough specifics from candidates and doesn\u2019t believe that any of them are truly committed to making the changes they\u2019ve promised.\n\n\u201cThey speak from a different point of view,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cSay we\u2019re standing on two different sides of the street \u2014 your side of the street is messy. I see that your side of the street is messy, but I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s messy, so I don\u2019t want to be there, but I can act like I want to be there. I can see the problem, and I think I know what\u2019s causing the problem, but if I\u2019m not there, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what I see with all of the candidates \u2014 they\u2019re across the street, looking in.\u201d\n\nOver the past two years, BLOC has expanded the Zip codes it targets and has trained more than 100 ambassadors, all recruited from local neighborhoods and paid $16 per hour. Most have never been politically involved, and some have never even voted. Of the 11 who were old enough to vote in the 2016 presidential election, only five say they cast ballots for Clinton.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t this super-academic group of folks trying to talk to the community,\u201d Lang said. \u201cWe\u2019re from the community. We\u2019re rough around the edges in the most beautiful way, but that\u2019s how we\u2019re able to be the most effective.\u201d\n\nIn less than two years, BLOC has become a force in Milwaukee politics. Its constant presence at community events and ability to connect with apathetic voters to boost turnout has made its endorsement highly sought-after for local politicians.\n\nBLOC\u2019s annual budget is about $850,000, with a majority coming from For Our Future, an organizing group financed by unions, and the Center for Popular Democracy. In 2020, Lang expects that to swell to at least $2 million, and she\u2019s hopeful that she can dramatically increase the number of ambassadors.\n\nAs new teams of ambassadors hit the streets, they continue to hear about the same needs: More after-school programs. More grants to help low-income residents fix their aging houses or clean up their yards. Fewer high-speed police chases. More speed bumps and fewer potholes. More compassion and employment opportunities for those with records.\n\nEach election brings an opportunity for these neighborhoods to send a message \u2014 especially in a presidential year. But it can be difficult to come up with an answer when residents say it doesn\u2019t matter if they vote.\n\nDespite her group\u2019s successes, Lang often feels defeated.", "description": "The task has fallen to local organizers, who believe a focus on neighborhood issues will drive voting.", "authors": ["Jenna Johnson", "National Political Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vo019P3mgT_xTi7W6j6vkxOZVNA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SSLFENHMJEI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
