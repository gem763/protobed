During a meet in Anchorage last Friday, the female official disqualified a 17-year-old Dimond High School student who had just won a 100-meter freestyle race on the grounds that the seat of her swimsuit was exposing too much of her behind.\n\nA swimming coach who is a friend of the girl\u2019s family tells TIME she believes that the girl stands out only because she is \u201cfuller-figured.\u201d Other people familiar with the girl tell TIME it is unlikely that she wore her suit in a manner that contravened attire rules intentionally; the swimmer\u2019s mother told local news station KTUU that the official had previously also \u201ccritiqued\u201d her younger sibling\u2019s swimsuit.\n\nThe Anchorage School District announced Tuesday that it is overturning the disqualification and reinstating the team\u2019s lost points. The district has also removed the official\u2019s certification, and will suspend the swimsuit coverage rule moving forward.\n\nAnnette Rohde, who was volunteering as an official at Friday\u2019s swim meet and is the mother of a girl on the Dimond High\u2019s swim team, tells TIME that she found the official\u2019s call to be \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make a call like that just because you don\u2019t like the way the suit is sitting on their body,\u201d Rohde says. A former gymnastics coach, Rohde says that she\u2019s familiar with the way focusing on an athlete\u2019s body can affect them. She describes the uniform rule as a \u201cgrey area\u201d in the rulebook.\n\nAlthough the swimsuit regulations are derived from guidelines written by the National Federation of State High School Associations, the way rules are enforced is determined by state-level sports association. The Federation\u2019s uniform rules say that girls\u2019 swimsuits should \u201ccover the buttocks and breasts,\u201d and presents a diagram that shows \u201cappropriate and inappropriate\u201d swimsuit coverage. (The Federation also issued a memorandum on swimsuits in August, which said that there was a \u201ctrend\u201d of female swimmers wearing their suits inappropriately.)\n\nHowever, some say that these rules are unclear, and that many female swimmers have at least part of their buttocks exposed. Swim team parents also argue it doesn\u2019t make sense to penalize athletes (let alone inconsistently) when their uniforms shift as they are competing.\n\nJoey Caterinichio, a national official for USA Swimming who also officiates for Anchorage high schools, says that Alaska School Activities Association implemented the uniform rule last year, and the disqualification policy was put in place this year. Caterinichio says that she\u2019s been pressing the Alaska Association to eliminate the rule because it\u2019s far too subjective, and puts an undue emphasis on students\u2019 bodies. While she says that the she\u2019s heard that the NFHS some girls hike their suits up in other states, she\u2019s never seen this happen in Alaska, and the students should be given the benefit of the doubt. \u201cIf children are in the same swimsuits, we\u2019re no longer judging the swimsuit \u2014 we\u2019re judging the body,\u201d Caterinichio tells TIME.\n\nLauren Langford, an Anchorage swim coach who also knows the 17-year-old\u2019s family, posted images of common swimsuit uniforms on Medium, showing that none of the suits could fully cover a swimmer\u2019s buttocks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not in compliance even before they get on the body of a swimmer. Some of these brands are currently being used as team suits. If lots of girls are wearing them, and they\u2019re cut in a way that is \u2018immodest,\u2019 why has only one swimmer been disqualified?,\u201d Langford wrote.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow our organization to become one that engages in body-shaming \u2014 it should promote a healthy body image for all athletes,\u201d Langford continued.\n\nIn a statement, the school district noted that the swimsuits were purchased by the team, and that the swim program had \u201cmade deliberate efforts over the last year to ensure athletes\u2019 uniforms meet the regulations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe disqualified athlete was wearing the approved, school-issued suit during the race. In the first three meets this year, the Dimond swim team has had no disqualifications related to the wear of the swim uniform,\u201d the district said.", "description": "The school district will suspend its swimsuit coverage rule moving forward", "authors": ["Tara Law"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Fyk8_j4chPNzOtP4ki1cDQ--~B/aD0xNDE0O3c9MjExOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/8c964d612fe5e04519ae090ae8a4c8da", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
