It\u2019s just a really a disgrace. It\u2019s a terrible thing for our country.\u201d\n\nThe president said Democrats \u201care going to lose the election and they know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re doing it,\u201d he said of impeachment. \u201cWe\u2019ve done so many things that are so incredible with tax cuts and regulations, and I have to put up with Adam Schiff on an absolutely perfect phone call to the new president of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump ignored the press and walked straight to a group of supporters when his helicopter, Marine One, touched down on the South Lawn of the White House.\n\nOne woman had tears in her eyes as she shook Mr. Trump\u2019s hand and appeared to say \u201cThank you\u201d to the president.\n\nDemocrats accuse Mr. Trump of threatening to withhold $391 million in military aid to Ukraine unless its president agreed to investigate Democratic front-runner Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter, who had a lucrative post with a Ukrainian gas company while the elder Biden was vice president.\n\nMr. Trump denies any wrongdoing and said there should be an investigation of the younger Biden\u2019s profiteering in Ukraine and China while his father was a top emissary of the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff doesn\u2019t talk about Joe Biden and his son walking away with millions of dollars from Ukraine, and then millions of dollars from China \u2014 walking away in a quick meeting, walking away with millions of dollars,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk about Joe Biden firing a prosecutor, and if that prosecutor\u2019s not fired, he\u2019s not going to give him money from the United States of America.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless Ukraine fired its top prosecutor, whose office had been investigating the gas company. Obama officials said they wanted the prosecutor ousted because he was ignoring corruption.\n\n\u2022 Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
