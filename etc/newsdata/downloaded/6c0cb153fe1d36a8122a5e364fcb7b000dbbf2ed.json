Sondland said he wanted to make sure that no one was transcribing or monitoring the conversation.\n\nNo security assistance for Ukraine\n\nDuring a regular National Security Council call on July 18, an unidentified staff person from the White House Office of Management and Budget said \u2014 to Taylor's alarm \u2014 that \"her boss\" had instructed her not to approve any additional spending of security aid for Ukraine until further notice.\n\n\"I and others sat in astonishment \u2014 the Ukrainians were fighting the Russians and counted on not only the training and weapons, but also the assurance of U.S. support,\" Taylor wrote.\n\nNSC officials told Taylor that they were unaware of any official change in U.S. policy on Ukraine, but confirmed that White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney \u2014 who had a \"skeptical view of Ukraine\" \u2014 had put the hold on the aid.\n\n\"No stone unturned\"\n\nTaylor recounted a July 20 phone conversation with Sondland where the EU ambassador said he had told the Ukrainian president to use the phrase \"I will leave no stone unturned\" when speaking to Trump about \"investigations.\"\n\nUkrainians at risk\n\nOn a trip to the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine, Taylor said he and Volker received a briefing from the commander on the front line, where they could see hostile Russian-led forces.\n\n\"Over 13,000 Ukrainians had been killed in the war, one or two a week,\" Taylor wrote. \"More Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the U.S. assistance.\"\n\nA mistake\n\nSondland told Taylor in a Sept. 1 phone call that Trump wanted Zelenskiy to state publicly that Ukraine would investigate Burisma \u2014 the energy company where the son of former Vice President Joe Biden sat on the board \u2014 and investigate alleged (and debunked) Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nSondland also told Taylor that \"he had made a mistake\" by telling the Ukrainian officials that a White House meeting with Zelenskiy depended on that public statement. \"In fact, Ambassador Sondland said, 'everything' was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance,\" Taylor wrote.", "description": "Ambassador William Taylor said U.S. aid to Ukraine was contingent on the country undertaking investigations that would help President Trump politically.
