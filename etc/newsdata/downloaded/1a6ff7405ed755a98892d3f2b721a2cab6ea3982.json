This followed earlier complaints about excessive alcohol consumption and boorish behaviour during working hours.\n\nLast week Mr Neal told the BBC that the Bloomberg revelations had been \"devastating\", adding: \"We thought there were signs that it was a reality.\"\n\nThe survey, carried about by the Banking Standards Board, was open to all 45,000 people who work at the marketplace, not just its 800 direct staff, and around 6,000 people participated.\n\nOne in five respondents said that they did not believe they had equal opportunities at Lloyd's, regardless of gender.\n\nMeanwhile, a quarter said they had observed excessive consumption of alcohol at the marketplace during the past year, while 22% had seen people in the organisation \"turn a blind eye\" to inappropriate behaviour.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Lloyd's marketplace is a City institution\n\nIn response, Lloyd's promised to launch a gender balance plan with \"measurable and achievable targets\". It will also publish new standards of business conduct and establish an advisory group of experts to drive \"cultural transformation\".\n\nThis follows previous moves to boost the reporting of harassment and punish those who misbehave.\n\nInsurance is a largely male dominated industry in the UK, and Lloyd's of London's previous boss, Dame Inga Beale was the only woman to lead the company in its 331-year history.\n\nUnder her watch the company banned its direct workers from drinking during office hours. However, according to Bloomberg's report in March, the move faced pushback from people at Lloyd's.\n\nThe appointment of Mr Neal, who took over from Dame Inga last October, has raised eyebrows in some quarters.\n\nHe was previously chief executive at Australian firm QBE Insurance, where he was penalised for failing to inform that board in a timely manner that he was in a relationship with his executive assistant.\n\nThe QBE board subsequently cut Mr Neal's short-term bonus by 20%, commenting: \"Both parties agree some recent personal decisions by the chief executive have been inconsistent with the board's expectations.\"", "description": "Almost 10% of workers at the Lloyd's of London insurance market say they have witnessed sexual harassment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/97A9/production/_108852883_johnnealheadshothi-res.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
