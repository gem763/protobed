They are a menace to society,' she told The Australian.\n\n'These guys are very strategic but the truth is they are not a climate change action group.\n\n'They may market themselves that way. They are hell bent on deconstructing society as we know it \u2026 they operate on a manifesto of delusions based on a rejection of European colonisation and trad\u00aditional values that most mainstream Australians hold dear.'\n\nProtestors from the Extinction Rebellion march on day six of protests stopping traffic in the city district of Melbourne last week\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters swarmed major Australian cities on Friday.\n\nActivists buried their heads in the sand at Sydney's Manly Beach, while Brisbane's William Jolly Bridge was flooded with marchers.\n\nIn Melbourne, more than 100 activists blocked cars and trams in both directions causing major disruptions.\n\nA large number of activists were arrested.\n\nMs Storer, who has a masters degree in human rights, said her group planned to run counter campaigns to combat 'radical agendas'.\n\nAdvance Australia has positioned itself in direct competition with left-wing group GetUp! and Ms Storer says it will be the voice for 'mainstream Australia'.\n\nHowever, the group has stiff competition. GetUp! has been growing in popularity since it was launched in August 2005 to encourage Internet activism in Australia.", "description": "Liz Storer, 36, has been announced as the\u00a0new national director of \u00adcentre-right lobby group Advance Australia.", "authors": ["Kelsey Wilkie For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/01/19764366-0-image-a-10_1571185587462.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
