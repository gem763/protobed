REUTERS/Mukhtar Kholdorbekov/Files\n\nNUR-SULTAN (Reuters) - Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on Monday criticised the central bank\u2019s monetary policy ahead of its interest rate review, urging the bank to ensure affordable long-term credit is available to local businesses.\n\n\u201cThe insufficient efficiency of monetary policy is becoming one of the impediments to the country\u2019s economic development,\u201d told parliament in an annual address, adding that businesses struggled to get loans from the banking sector.\n\nKazakhstan\u2019s central bank has kept its policy rate flat at 9.0% since cutting it by 25 basis points in March. It will review the rate next week, and Tokayev\u2019s criticism may affect the regulator\u2019s decision.\n\nTokayev also ordered the oil-exporting Central Asian nation\u2019s government to delay until 2023 the introduction of additional 5% pension contributions, effectively an extra payroll tax that was set to be implemented next year.\n\nThe planned additional payroll tax would have hindered job creation and wage growth, Tokayev said.\n\n\u201cWe will then get back to this matter,\u201d he said, leaving the door open for further changes to the plan.", "description": "Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on Monday criticised the central bank's monetary policy ahead of its interest rate review, urging the bank to ensure affordable long-term credit is available to local businesses.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425291885&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810DU"}
