Aluminium is among the most common because it\u2019s easy to clean and generally resistant to chipping and peeling.\n\nMany aluminium pans have an enamel coating on the outside and are non-stick on the inside. If you don\u2019t mind forking out a bit extra, you might want to consider upgrading to hard-anodised aluminium pans, which have been electrochemically treated to give a hard finish that\u2019s even more resistant to chips and scratches. Neither work on induction hobs, however.\n\nStainless steel pans also have durability on their side and they happen to be dishwasher safe, as well as being immune to scratches or worse. But food can stick and you can get hot spots, although the addition of copper or aluminium layers sandwiched between the stainless steel layers can help.\n\nWhile cast-iron pans are not for the weak wristed and take their time to heat up, you only need a low to medium heat, which they retain beautifully and they last years.\n\nMost have an enamel or non-stick interior. Copper pans (usually bonded with stainless steel for extra strength) also boast longevity but heat up really quickly and have outstanding heat distribution. But they\u2019re expensive, need special care so as not to tarnish and don\u2019t work on most glass-topped hobs or halogen, electric radiant and sealed plate hobs.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Not only do the pans nest inside one another, but they have stackable lids and easily detachable handles that are really sturdy when clipped on \u2013 which can be easily transferred from one to the other when cooking. You can bung them in the oven up to 250C and they\u2019re suitable for all hob types including induction and they can go in the dishwasher. With titanium bases to ensure they last you years, this is a practical option for big families, although the biggest isn\u2019t huge so you might need to buy one or two extra jumbo pans to add to your collection.\n\nBuy now\n\nEaziglide never-stick 3-piece saucepan set: \u00a3135, John Lewis & Partners\n\nIt\u2019s a bold claim to say nothing will ever stick to a pan, but with these it\u2019s actually true \u2013 even scrambled egg and home-made caramel sauce left no trace (which obviously gets another big tick for being easier to wash up). They are surprisingly lightweight even when full to the brim, and the twistable draining holes mean you can control the amount of steam that escapes during cooking. They\u2019re suitable for all hob types and to top it all off, you can finish off your culinary creations in the oven, up to a scorching 260C. The night sky finish gives it a classy look, but the handles could be more grippy.\n\nBuy now\n\nZyliss forged aluminium 3-piece pan set: \u00a3119.99, Lakeland\n\nIf you had a budget of around \u00a3100 for your new pan set, we\u2019d urge you to go slightly over for this set of three aluminium saucepans whose heat distribution properties far surpass other pan sets we tried around this price range. The triple-layered ceramic-enforced non-stick is impressive too, which the manufacturer says is down to whizzy Swiss technology \u2013 the bottom line is you need little or no oil and can use any utensils, including metal, and it all goes in the dishwasher with no risk of chipping. The soft-grip handles get 10 out of 10 from us for ergonomics and yet they are oven safe up to 180C.\n\nBuy now\n\nArgos Home 3-piece aluminium pan set: \u00a319, Argos\n\nIf you don\u2019t have more than \u00a320 to spend (off to uni, perhaps?) or you want very lightweight pans, this set of three in a retro-looking red design are a good buy. While they\u2019re not going to set the world on fire with whizzy features or durability, they do their job well and the handles stay cool even when the pans get really hot. We also like the glass lids, with a handy air vent. But they don\u2019t suit induction hobs and the non-stick surface is prone to scratching if you wash them up too haphazardly.\n\nBuy now\n\nLe Creuset 3-ply stainless steel 3-piece saucepan set: \u00a3345, Le Creuset\n\nYou\u2019ll want a lot of pan for your penny at this price and although they do dull a little over time, they are otherwise hard to fault, heating evenly on any heat source \u2013 and right up to the sides \u2013 and withstanding any kinds of utensils, thanks to the multi-layered stainless steel and aluminium. The lids fit tightly so no moisture escapes and the handles are ergonomic. We also like the capacity markers and all-round pouring rim. They are dishwasher-friendly, oven safe, and if you\u2019re not happy with them after 90 days, you get your money back. We reckon they\u2019ll last you a lifetime.\n\nBuy now\n\nLakeland Hard anodised bell shaped 5-piece pan set: \u00a3166.99, Lakeland\n\nThis comprehensive set (which includes milk pan, three saucepans and a frying pan) gets the thumbs up from us for their bell shape, which look good and have wider bases than their predecessors. They\u2019re oven-friendly up to 180C \u2013 a boon for one-pot cooking or browning something off before serving. Other plus points include the genuinely non-stick surface, speedy heat-up time, robust glass lids and the fact that they come out sparkling from the dishwasher. An excellent mid-range set to suit all needs from a company with great customer service and that never quibbles about returns.\n\nBuy now\n\nRobert Welch Campden saucepan set, 3-piece: \u00a3170, Robert Welch\n\nThis brand, which has historically been best known for its top-quality knives and cutlery, has been branching out in recent years, including with some top-notch cookware. This stackable three-piece solid set not only looks gorgeous but works on all hob types. They heat up quickly, leaving no cold spots, thanks to the thick base made up of copper sandwiched between two layers of stainless steel to ensure even heat distribution across the whole base. And the handles stay cool so no need for hot hands. A stunning set that you can add to over the years \u2013 or go the whole hog first time round and get the 10-piece set for \u00a3525.\n\nBuy now\n\nStellar stay cool 4-piece draining saucepan set: \u00a3102.99, Amazon\n\nAnother professional-level set for the keener cook, the glass lids make draining a breeze and we also like the internal measuring guides so you don\u2019t have to pour everything into a measuring jug first. The handles never get even remotely warm (as you\u2019d hope, given the name) and there\u2019s no non-stick surface to chip or lose its efficiency over time. Suitable for all hob types and dishwasher and oven safe to 180C, these pans should look as good as new even years down the line.\n\nBuy now\n\nCirculon momentum hard anodised 5-piece pan set: \u00a389.97, Amazon\n\nThis is one of those brands that once you try, you\u2019ll go back to again and again. Among the main reasons are that they work on all hobs, last decades, heat evenly and can be used with metal utensils as the hard-anodised construction is twice as hard as stainless steel and doesn\u2019t chip or scratch. They also boast a patented non-stick system with an iconic groove design that food genuinely doesn\u2019t stick to, and yet you can bung it all in the dishwasher after use. We like the fact that a frying pan is included in this set \u2013 arguably their best bit of cookware. But they aren\u2019t quite as quick to heat up as some.\n\nBuy now\n\nPrestige dura forge 5-piece pan set: \u00a389.99, Prestige\n\nThis comprehensive set has five pans, each with a 3D steel base and cold forged aluminium body which \u2013 in plain English \u2013 translates to all the strength and thickness needed for easy cooking. We liked the chunky base, the strengthened rims that don\u2019t warp over time, and the non-stick seemed more durable than others in this price-range \u2013 and also meant we could, for example, fry and egg with no oil. Suitable for all hob types, they\u2019re dishwasher safe and can go in the oven up to 180C. There are better quality pans out there, but for the price this is a great all-rounder set.\n\nBuy now\n\nAnolon Advanced 3-piece glass lidded saucepan set: \u00a3132.99, Amazon\n\nWe love the snazzy silver-bronze look of these slightly flared pans from Anolon, a brand known for their quality professional and home cookware. At \u00a350 each, they don\u2019t come cheap, but for keen cooks with a sense of style, these thick-based pans are outstanding, with heat distribution that puts most other pan sets to shame and whose non-stick coating doesn\u2019t chip and lasts years, with barely any need for oil when cooking. The trade-off for this kind of quality non-stick is often that you can\u2019t put the pans in the dishwasher, but that\u2019s not an issue with these and they can go in the oven up to 200C too. It can be a little tricky to drain water as the rim is quite slippery, but that\u2019s not an uncommon problem. You can use them on any hob and you get a lifetime guarantee.\n\nBuy now\n\nProCook professional steel cookware set, 6-piece: \u00a3199, Procook\n\nMore serious cooks will love these six hard-wearing pans that include all the staples (plus, you can buy additional pieces ranging from steamer insert to stockpots). The 18/10 stainless steel is top quality, with a base that heats up instantly and evenly, spreading up the sides in no time. They work on all hob types, as well as going in an oven up to 260C (probably hotter than your oven will even go). Then, when you\u2019re done, you can bung them in the dishwasher \u2013 in fact, they clean more easily than any other set we tried. The liquid measure on the inside is great for adding ingredients as you go and the frying pan has a brilliant non-stick surface. Shame they don\u2019t have the easy-pour lids that the Gourmet range does, though, and be warned they are quite heavy.\n\nBuy now\n\nGreenPan mayflower 3-piece saucepan set: \u00a383.96, Natural Collection\n\nBest suited to more rustic kitchens, these bluey-green aluminium pans with stay-cool wooden handles and see-through lids look so nice that you may well want to have them on show. Performance wise, the stand out point is that they\u2019ve been treated with a ceramic non-stick surface fortified with diamonds, no less, which makes a massive difference to the durability. Suitable for any hob, we were taken with the lovely thick base and comfortable handles. But it\u2019s a shame they won\u2019t go in the oven and, as you\u2019ve probably guessed from the handles, they are not dishwasher friendly either.\n\nBuy now\n\nTower trustone 3-piece saucepan set: \u00a349.83, Amazon\n\nThe five layers of coating do a good job of keeping the heat steady and even during cooking, while the glass lids have steam ventilation and the handles are well balanced and stay cool. We like the look too \u2013 a speckled black that gives a contemporary aesthetic, and you can use them all on hob types. The non-stick is impressive for the price and if you need frying pans too, buy the 5-piece set for an extra \u00a318, also available on Amazon. They are lightweight so good for weaker wrists, but on the downside the shape can distort a bit over time.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Saucepan sets\n\nThe all-singing all-dancing Tefal Ingenio 13-piece set won us over with its innovation, practicality and the fact that you get so many pans to cater for your every cooking need. We\u2019re also giving a special mention to Le Creuset 3-ply stainless steel 3-piece saucepan set, which don\u2019t come cheap but are an absolute joy to use and are also available in toughened non-stick.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
