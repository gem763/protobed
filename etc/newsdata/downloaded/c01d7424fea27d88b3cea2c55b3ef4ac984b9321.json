But journalists have effectively demonstrated that many Republicans who stormed the hearing actually have the right to enter the proceedings, and that many others have actually availed themselves of the opportunity to participate and question witnesses.\n\nYet there are even deeper absurdities on display here. The other message all this is meant to send is that House Republicans are actually representing Trump\u2019s interests in these proceedings to devastating effect and that their successful exoneration of Trump in them is what\u2019s being concealed from the American people.\n\nAD\n\nA new Wall Street Journal editorial demonstrates how this works. The editorial concedes that some witness testimony \u2014 such as that of Ambassador William Taylor, who mounted a powerful case that Trump engaged in a corrupt quid pro quo by withholding military aid to leverage a foreign power into helping him smear a political opponent \u2014 doesn\u2019t make Trump\u2019s machinations \u201clook good.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut the editorial then quotes Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) claiming this about Taylor: \u201cMuch of his leaked opening statement collapsed, but Schiff keeps the public in the dark on that!\u201d\n\nThe \u201cleaked\u201d opening statement, of course, was the full opening statement, but put that aside. The Journal editorial then notes that \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is how Mr. Taylor responded to questions\u201d about what he knew firsthand, adding: \u201cIf the evidence against Mr. Trump is so damning, then why not make it all public now so the American people can judge for themselves?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nYou see, Zeldin wants you to know that the withering cross-examination skills of Republicans like himself debunked what you think you learned from Taylor in his already-revealed opening statement. The point here isn\u2019t just that the already-known and deeply damning details in Taylor\u2019s testimony should be seen as suspect, simply because House Republicans say so. It\u2019s also that the effectiveness of House Republicans unmasked this, and Democrats are trying to conceal it.\n\nAD\n\nThe next phase\n\nYes, of course the transcripts should be released, and of course the American people should have all the facts. But that will happen; that the initial investigative phase is private is eminently defensible. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, has vowed to release the transcripts, with redactions for classified and sensitive information. Might Democrats break this promise? Anything\u2019s possible, but it would be very surprising if we don\u2019t see these transcripts very soon.\n\nAD\n\nIndeed, the very same witnesses Republicans claim they have reduced to a puddle of incoherence will likely undergo open questioning once the inquiry moves into its public phase. The Post reports that Democrats hope to do this by mid-November, and that it will likely include open questioning of Taylor and other key witnesses.\n\nAD\n\nSo, good news, Republicans: Whether it\u2019s by released transcripts or by open hearings, or both, the public will get to see all of you modern-day Clarence Darrows ruthlessly dismantle Taylor\u2019s claims.\n\nHow this game really works\n\nI\u2019m going to go out on a limb and suggest that the temporary closed-door nature of the hearings actually works in favor of Republicans, not against them. It\u2019s the only thing they have left to cast doubt, however absurdly, on the damning information that\u2019s already right there on the record.\n\nAD\n\nAnd it allows them to convey to the Audience of One \u2014 and his followers \u2014 that they are fighting the good fight on his behalf, without their self-ascribed effectiveness actually being subject to outside scrutiny.\n\nThere\u2019s another layer of absurdity here. Once the transcripts are released or once we get public hearings, it is highly likely that they will not actually show that Republicans have lacerated Taylor\u2019s case.\n\nAD\n\nBut for Trump\u2019s most ardent loyalists, this simply won\u2019t matter. If and when publicly revealed testimony does not exonerate Trump, they\u2019ll simply lie to the contrary, and treat the fact of public release as the hook to claim that the Democratic coverup has been exposed, counting on their massive propaganda apparatus to amplify that story line. This is exactly what happened with the Nunes memo \u2014 it was a total fiasco, yet Republicans widely pretended it was deeply revelatory.\n\nAD\n\nThe story we\u2019ve seen in this whole scandal is that one after another, Trump\u2019s levees are collapsing in the face of successive waves of factual revelations. Indeed, as the New York Times reports:\n\nSome Republicans are growing increasingly uneasy about the inquiry, and fretting that it could get much, much worse for them. Publicly, they are taking their cues from the president, and Wednesday\u2019s performance appeared intended to please Mr. Trump. The president has fumed publicly and privately that Republicans have not been tough enough in defending him.\n\nSo these displays are all about showing that Republicans are fighting for Trump. But they would not be so worried about where this is all going if more public disclosure were likely to help exonerate him.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Even as they publicly try to show Trump they're fighting for him, Republicans are privately in a panic.", "authors": ["Greg Sargent", "Opinion Writer Covering National Politics", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5O9Acvj-bicTP7xgM_GcE48VzA0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UEZXPQHWEAI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
