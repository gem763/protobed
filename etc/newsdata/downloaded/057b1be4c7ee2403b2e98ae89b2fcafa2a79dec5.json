It was pumped into their chow.\n\nBy comparison, mice normally consume less than one per cent of sodium on a daily basis, researchers wrote in the journal Nature.\n\nThe amount of sodium the trial mice consumed would be the equivalent of a human eating up to five times an adult's recommended daily limit.\n\nThe team conducted brain scans on the animals throughout the research to monitor how the tau changed in their brains.\n\nThey noticed the protein began to accumulate at the four-week mark and continued to elevate throughout the study.\n\nAt 12 weeks the mice began struggling to recognise objects and found it difficult to remember pathways in maze tests.\n\nWHAT IS DEMENTIA? THE KILLER DISEASE THAT ROBS SUFFERERS OF THEIR MEMORIES A GLOBAL CONCERN Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe a range of progressive neurological disorders, that is, conditions affecting the brain. There are many different types of dementia, of which Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common. Some people may have a combination of types of dementia. Regardless of which type is diagnosed, each person will experience their dementia in their own unique way. Dementia is a global concern but it is most often seen in wealthier countries, where people are likely to live into very old age. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED? The Alzheimer\u2019s Society reports there are more than 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK today, of which more than 500,000 have Alzheimer's. It is estimated that the number of people living with dementia in the UK by 2025 will rise to over 1 million. In the US, it's estimated there are 5.5 million Alzheimer's sufferers. A similar percentage rise is expected in the coming years. As a person\u2019s age increases, so does the risk of them developing dementia. Rates of diagnosis are improving but many people with dementia are thought to still be undiagnosed. IS THERE A CURE? Currently there is no cure for dementia. But new drugs can slow down its progression and the earlier it is spotted the more effective treatments are.

With the majority of our salt intakes coming from processed food made by the food industry, it is therefore their duty to remove it for the benefit of our health.'\n\n'HOW DID THE RESEARCHERS COMPARE THE COGNITIVE ABILITIES OF THE MICE?' The novel object recognition test (NOR) test was conducted under dim light in a plastic box. Plastic objects that varied in colour and shape but had similar sizes were used. A video camera mounted on the wall directly above the box was used to record the test. Mice were put in the box for one full day before the test to let them acclimatise to their new surroundings. Two identical sample objects were then added to the box, which the mice were allowed to inspect for five minutes. A day later, mice were placed in the same box but one of the two objects was replaced by a new object that differed slightly. Exploration of an object was defined as the mouse sniffing the object or touching the object while looking at it. The amount of time taken to explore the novel object was expressed as a percentage of the total exploration time and provides an index of recognition memory. Mice which were on the high-salt diets took more than a fifth longer to familiarise themselves with the objects compared to rodents on a normal diet. The other cognitive test, known as the Barnes maze, consisted of a circular open surface that was 90 cm in diameter. There were 20 circular holes equally spaced around the perimeter. On each trial a mouse was placed into a start tube located in the centre of the maze, the start tube was raised, and the buzzer was turned on until the mouse entered the escape hole. For each trial mice were given three minutes to locate the escape hole, after which they were guided to the escape hole or placed directly into the escape box if they failed to enter it. Mice on the high-salt diet took up to three times longer than healthy ones to complete the maze. Some did not finish it at all.", "description": "Researchers from the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York found feeding mice an extremely salty diet caused the build-up of a protein called tau.
