No prime minister has lost their first vote in office since 1783 \u2014 let alone their first 3. The opposition Labour Party said it would not back an election until the bill ruling out a no-deal is enshrined in law. It has to pass through Parliament's upper chamber, the House of Lords, for that to happen.\n\nThe tension: Lawmakers from across Parliament, including the ones expelled from the Conservative Party yesterday, view it as their moral obligation to stop a no-deal Brexit, which experts warn could cause food and drug shortages, a \"shock\" to the economy and possibly the outbreak of violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nJohnson's controversial decision to suspend Parliament from next week until Oct. 14 has forced lawmakers to work fast to lock the prime minister into a position where a no-deal Brexit is impossible.\n\nHow we got here:\n\nOn Monday, cross-party lawmakers unveiled a bill that would give Johnson until Oct. 19 to negotiate a deal with the EU.

Hours later, Parliament defeated Johnson in a vote to take control of the legislative agenda. On Wednesday, Parliament voted in favor of the bill to block a no-deal Brexit. The 21 rebels who were expelled for voting against Johnson have served for a total of 350 years as Conservative lawmakers and include several high-ranking former government ministers and the grandson of Winston Churchill.\n\nThe bottom line: Johnson is in a bind and has completely thrown away his majority. No one quite knows how the next 57 days will shake out.\n\nGo deeper: The sticking point standing in the way of a Brexit deal", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson will now bring a vote to hold new elections in October.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/fjk7Ylk1hFKE-a6XxdcB6bXZXbk=/0x0:1557x876/1920x1080/2019/09/04/1567623541051.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
