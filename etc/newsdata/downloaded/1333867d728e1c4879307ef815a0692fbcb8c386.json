However, he sets about rectifying the situation in the coming episodes, as he digs the dirt on the local doc.\n\nIt\u2019s become pretty clear over the last couple of months that Gary has set his sights on Maria. However, her history with Ali has somewhat prevented him from being able to take his developing feelings one step further, and thus he\u2019s determined to do something about it.\n\nCoronation Street has revealed that \u2014 in the coming episodes \u2014 Gary gets his PI on the case, so that he can find out something about Ali. The PI later reports back to his boss with knowledge that Ali has been missing shifts at work, and has been acting rather odd as of late.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith his interest piqued, Gary then asks the PI to investigate further and, afterwards, he discovers that a hospital pharmacist was arrested for stealing \u2014 and supplying \u2014 drugs.\n\nGary sets about finding said drug dealer \u2014 who goes by the name of Big Farmer \u2014 and once he locates him, he drags him into the furniture shop and demands that he reveal everything there is to know about Ali.\n\nThe question is: will Big Farmer reveal the truth and thus give Gary the leverage he needs?\n\nIt\u2019s a possibility, but Gary had better not underestimate Ali, as the doc makes a discovery himself, when he reveals the he\u2019s in possession of Gary\u2019s ledger, before threatening to inform to Maria that he\u2019s operating as a loan shark.\n\nWith both men seemingly desperate to get dirt on the other, who will get the upper hand?\n\nGary\u2019s on a mission, and we know that his dark side isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon, so Ali could be in danger.\n\nCoronation Street continues Monday 28thNovember at 7:30pm on ITV.\n\nMORE: Coronation Street spoilers: Daniel Osbourne leaves the street after Sinead Tinker dies\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Gary is hellbent on getting Ali out of the picture, and thus he pulls out all the stops to get what he wants.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gary-Windass-in-Coronation-Street-11a4_1572255260.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
