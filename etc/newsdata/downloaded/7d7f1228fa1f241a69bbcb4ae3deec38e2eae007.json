There were instances where he was not himself because of the pain and the trauma he went through,\" Senzo's cousin, Siyabonga Meyiwa, said on Tuesday.\n\nHe was speaking from the Meyiwa family home where Police Minister Bheki Cele was due to visit following Sam's death on Monday.\n\nSiyabonga said the family had been waiting for \"definitive answers for quite a while\" on the former Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates star's death.\n\n\"People sometimes say the wheels of justice move slowly. We are still hopeful that the minister will assist in this instance that the perpetrators of this crime are caught and brought to book. This has gone on for too long without an arrest being made.\"\n\nHe said that Sam was always heartbroken about the death of his son.\n\n\"Every time we tried to assist, he reminded us that we could never fill the pain he felt as a father\u2026 He equated Senzo to a flower that was taken too early.\"\n\nSiyabonga said his cousin Senzo was a national hero.\n\n\"For the crime to be unattended caused a tremendous level of pain and it definitely had an effect on Sam.\"\n\nMessages of support and condolences poured in from across South Africa after the goalkeeper's father died on Monday in his Umlazi home.\n\nIt was his second stroke.\n\nCele is due to meet with the family later on Tuesday.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
