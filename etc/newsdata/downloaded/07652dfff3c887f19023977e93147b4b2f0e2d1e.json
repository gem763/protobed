More\n\nWalmart takes action: Walmart to no longer sell certain ammunition, ask customers to stop open carry in stores\n\nKey questions relating to the Walmart open-carry decision:\n\nAre they legally allowed to do this?\n\nYes. While laws vary from state to state, businesses are generally allowed to ban people from bringing certain items into their locations.\n\nBecause they are private entities, businesses are not subject to the Second Amendment, which prevents the government from making laws that infringe on citizens' right to bear arms.\n\nWith Walmart taking action, others may follow. In fact, Kroger on Tuesday announced a similar request for customers to refrain from openly carrying guns. Others had already done so, including Target and Starbucks.\n\nHow do I know if a retailer prevents me from bringing my gun inside?\n\nLook for signs before you enter.\n\nThe U.S. Concealed Carry Association notes that in Wisconsin, for example, you'll be asked to take your gun outside the store or leave if the business notices you carrying the gun inside the store.\n\n\"However, in some other states, you may run into some serious legal problems just for missing the sign and entering the business,\" attorney Tom Grieve wrote in a legal analysis for the USCCA. \"It is on you from a liability standpoint if you missed it. No warnings, no second chances; you will face charges if you are caught.\"\n\nSomething else to watch for: Certain locations that ban guns may not have signs, such as post offices.\n\nAlso, openly carrying guns is not allowed in all states. Make sure you're in compliance with federal, state and local laws in all cases.\n\nWon't Walmart lose business?\n\nYes. When Dick's Sporting Goods banned sales of assault-style rifles and handguns, the retailer's sales initially suffered. But the company stuck by the decision, and overall sales recently posted an encouraging increase.\n\nThe National Rifle Association said Walmart will feel pain.\n\n\"Lines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America\u2019s fundamental freedoms,\" the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action said in a statement.\n\nWalmart estimated its market share in ammunition would fall from about 20% to a range of 6% to 9%. But Walmart is so big that it may not hurt too much: The company's revenue totaled about half a trillion dollars in 2018.\n\n\"Walmart is a leader in utilizing and analyzing data. They understand well how much this could hurt their bottom line and have decided to do it anyway,\" Michigan's Gordon said.\n\nIs this a public relations play?\n\nIt depends on who you ask. The NRA says yes.", "description": "Walmart's decision to ask customers to refrain from openly carrying firearms cast a spotlight on the balancing act that retailers must maintain.", "authors": ["Nathan Bomey", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0mqHhHG4GyZavmnLxYQ.Bg--~B/aD0yNzM2O3c9MzkyNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_money_325/a96ce969b7e65eb807ab8722eafa561c"}
