He was widely praised for the swift action, with even liberal media and his usual \u2018resistance\u2019 critics fawning over the display of military might.\n\nAlso on rt.com RT tours fortified caves in Syria where terrorists planned assaults, made drones & filmed fake chemical attack videos\n\nA new study disputing the findings of US intelligence and UN investigators was due to be published in the Princeton University-based Science & Global Security (SGS) \u2014 but is mysteriously being held back following an \u201cindependent internal review of the editorial process\u201d which threw up unidentified \u201cissues\u201d with the peer-review and revision process.\n\nIt appears that the so-called issues were only discovered after the journal came under a barrage of public criticism for daring to publish an alternative view. In a note on the front page of its website, the journal\u2019s editors said \u201cquestions have been asked\u201d of its decision to publish the report, which prompted the review. The Khan Sheikhoun attack \u2014 and who was behind it \u2014 has been hotly disputed over the last two years, with anyone daring to question the mainstream narrative labelled an \u201cAssad apologist.\u201d\n\nYet, the \u201conly thing\u201d that should matter is whether the report is \u201ctechnically correct,\u201d Postol told RT after the journal decided to halt publication. \u201cThis is a science based journal, and if there [are] any technical errors in it, they need to point them out,\" he said, adding the criticisms are coming \u201cfrom people who have no technical expertise.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com RT films inside liberated town of Khan Sheikhoun in Syria\u2019s Idlib province (VIDEO)\n\nThat is likely a reference to the controversial Bellingcat, a \u2018citizen investigation\u2019 outlet funded by US, UK and other Western governments and foundations. Its founder Eliot Higgins has no scientific training whatsoever, but nonetheless shot to prominence over his \u201copen source\u201d online \u201cinvestigations\u201d \u2014 the results of which seem to fit perfectly with US and UK government narratives and are instantly caught by Western media. Higgins published a critique of the scientific paper last month and has previously branded the accomplished MIT professor an\u201cidiot.\u201d\n\n\"What's sad, is that a journal that's supposed to be dedicated to scientific enquiry and that is supposed to be dedicated to disarmament and arms control, is apparently being bullied or allowing itself to be bullied into political censorship and bias,\u201d investigative journalist Rick Sterling told RT of SGS\u2019s decision to halt the publication.\n\nEvidence tampering?\n\nThe study, which was instigated by Goong Chen, a professor of applied mathematics at Texas A&M University in College Station, focuses on an impact crater in the road where the sarin gas was allegedly released. A report by the UN and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) report concluded the crater was made from a bomb dropped from a plane, which would implicate the Syrian government. Chen\u2019s models, however, suggest that it was formed by an artillery rocket with an explosive warhead.\n\nAlso on rt.com After 5 yrs under jihadist control, militants flee Syrian town where 2017 \u2018chemical attack\u2019 occurred\n\nPostol and Chen\u2019s report also notes that a dead goat on the scene, allegedly killed by a nerve agent in the attack, could actually have been killed and dragged to the spot from another location. They point to the rope around its neck and markings on the ground that suggest evidence could have been tampered with.\n\nThe real irony in this battle of narratives is that, so far, experts have identified no technical faults with the new report \u2014 unlike the UN/OPCW assessment, which Postol said was \u201cnearly impossible\" to explain because it contains such \u201cextraodrinary problems.\u201d One of those problems, he said, is that while investigators said they found evidence of bombing on satellite imagery, the images in question actually show \u201cno evidence of bomb damage.\u201d Moreover, OPCW had no mandate to attribute responsibility at the time.\n\nIn spite of the evident concerns regarding the accuracy of the UN/OPCW report, its assessment has been held up as gospel truth in the mainstream Western media, while the Chen-Postol report is being attacked.\n\nAlso on rt.com Bellingcat unloads 4,000-word piece on Tulsi Gabbard over her questioning Syria chemical attacks\n\nPostol said he believes it would be a \u201cvery big mistake\u201d if the SGS allowed itself to be pressured by people with no scientific basis for their criticism, but added that he had \u201cvery high confidence in the integrity\u201d of the journal.\n\nAsked what he believes really happened at Khan Sheikhoun, Postol said he had \u201cextensive discussions\u201d about the incident with Seymour Hersh \u2013 the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist, who exposed US atrocities in Vietnam and torture in Iraq. An article published by Hersh in June 2017 claims the casualties in the attack were actually caused when conventional explosives damaged a building containing chemicals and produced a toxic cloud.\n\nEverything Hersh found is \u201cexactly correct relative to the technical underpinnings,\" Postol said.\n\nMainstream media in the West has given little attention to the findings of Hersh, Postol or any of the other experts involved in producing the new report, preferring to stick to a predetermined narrative of Syrian guilt pushed by Bellingcat.\n\nLike this story?
