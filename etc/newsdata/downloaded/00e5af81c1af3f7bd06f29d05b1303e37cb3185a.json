She spent her time on the stage chastising world leaders for failing to take action to slow the effects of climate change. The speech quickly went viral and, while celebrated globally, also attracted vitriol \u2014 particularly from conservatives and trolls. A right-wing commentator on Fox News called Thunberg a \"mentally ill Swedish child\" (Fox News later apologized) and former \"Top Gear\" presenter Jeremy Clarkson lambasted the teen in a stinging op-ed in the UK tabloid The Sun. Canadian Member of Parliament Maxime Bernier has called her alarmist and mentally unstable.\n\nRead more: Former 'Top Gear' host Jeremy Clarkson told climate activist Greta Thunberg to 'be a good girl' and 'shut up'\n\nPresident Donald Trump also took a jab at Thunberg with a mocking tweet the day she delivered her speech, prompting her to change her Twitter bio to troll what he said. In a Twitter thread last Wednesday, she questioned \"I honestly don't understand why adults would choose to spend their time mocking and threatening teenagers and children for promoting science, when they could do something good instead. I guess they must simply feel so threatened by us.\"\n\nTweet Embed:\n\n//twitter.com/mims/statuses/1176930548146692096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nHere we go again...\n\nAs you may have noticed, the haters are as active as ever - going after me, my looks, my clothes, my behaviour and my differences.\n\nThey come up with every thinkable lie and conspiracy theory.

In March, she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for having launched what the Norwegian lawmaker Freddy Andre Ovstegard described to The Guardian as \"a mass movement which I see as a major contribution to peace.\"\n\n\"This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,\" she said during her UN speech. \"Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\"\n\nShe was invited earlier this week by a member of the Duma, the Russian lower house of parliament, to come to Russia to deliver a speech, according to Reuters.\n\nNOW WATCH: I swapped out my daily skincare products for cheaper versions found on Amazon under $15 \u2014 and some surprised me", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is the latest world leader to criticize climate activist Greta Thunberg following her speech at the UN Climate Action Summit.", "authors": ["Nicole Einbinder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qZg8TdXzv9milwky9msY4A--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/f9d45e16cf7c2af89c1329cb65762233", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
