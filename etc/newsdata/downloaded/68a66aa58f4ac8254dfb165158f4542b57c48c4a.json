Do we have to do more to promote them? Absolutely. Do we have to build their profile over the next four years? Absolutely. \u2026 We need that jaw-dropping talent to be more recognizable.\u201d\n\nSome story lines are starting to surface. Noah Lyles, Christian Coleman and Andre De Grasse are being billed as the next in line to fill the void left by the retirement of Bolt in 2017. The trio figures to be vying for medals in the 100 and 200 in Tokyo.\n\nThere\u2019s also Shaunae Miller-Uibo of the Bahamas, who plans to run the 200 and 400 at the Summer Games. Or perhaps Donavan Brazier, the American 800-meter gold medalist who\u2019s a member of Salazar\u2019s Nike Oregon Project (but not coached by him). After news of Salazar\u2019s doping ban broke earlier in the day in a long pursued by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, Brazier was left to answer questions moments after winning his race.\n\nSalazar\u2019s most-accomplished runner is Mo Farah, a four-time Olympic gold medalist from Britain. Asked if there was still a cloud over Farah, who parted ways with Salazar in 2017, Coe responded: \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable you guys are going to go on asking questions and the athletes are going to have to keep answering and the federations as well. The charges are serious and this will run and run.\n\n\u201cMo is an outstanding athlete and as I said at the time, and I get asked the question, as I do regularly, should this athlete be with this coach?\u201d Coe added. \u201cI say the burden of proof can only be on malfeasance. If that\u2019s proven clearly they shouldn\u2019t and if there are questions that are being raised the athletes should ask really tough questions.\u201d\n\nOther topics addressed by Coe:\n\n- On Caster Semenya\u2019s absence from worlds and the IAAF testosterone rule that would have required her to medically reduce her natural testosterone level in order to compete: \u201cThe regulations were tabled and suffused in a concept that a level playing is really important.\u201d\n\n- On the Russians competing as neutral athletes at worlds: \u201cYou\u2019ve got 30 of them here. That\u2019s important.\u201d\n\n- On the steamy conditions in road races (the stadium is kept cooler by an air-conditioning system): \u201cIt was a challenging climate. But the reality of it is we had a medical facility which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen in any championship - Olympics or world championships. I\u2019d be surprised if you had the same facility in Tokyo. I hope they do, but this is something really special.\u201d\n\nCoe became a bit defensive when asked if Qatar seemed like the right place to host the 2022 World Cup.\n\n\u201cWhy would it be the wrong place?\u201d Coe said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure any of us at this moment are in a position to want to make sporting relationships dependent upon current political fragilities.\u201d\n\nOne day, Coe envisions places such as Kenya, Ethiopia or Jamaica hosting a world championship. The organization is trying to reduce costs to make the championships more appealing to cities. The next version of worlds will be in Eugene, Oregon, in 2021.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re a global sport, we have to be seen as global,\u201d Coe said. \u201cIt can\u2019t keep going back to the same eight or nine places that we\u2019ve always sort of focused on in the past. But you won\u2019t get there in one jump.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a journey now.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sebastian Coe has a concise message for athletes who are dissing on Doha: Deal with it.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pat Graham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/qatar_athletics_worlds_02172_c0-222-4230-2688_s1770x1032.jpg?8aa89404e7ef4eb32252ac6b1e658001738a101c"}
