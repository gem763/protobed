And despite Norwich\u2019s improved showing after the break it was Martial who added the third, before Onel Hernandez hit a late consolation.\n\nHere are five things we learned as Man United took the points.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

United\u2019s third goal was a work of art in terms of their combination play: one running off the other, a neat back-heel and a clinical finish.\n\nThe fact they both missed penalties in the first 45 minutes shows there\u2019s work to do in terms of finding a clinical edge and top form, but it was still a big step in the right direction for a previously blunt Man United attack.\n\n2) Tim Krul\u2019s throwback to 2014\n\nHe might have conceded two first-half goals, but Norwich could have been looking at an embarrassing hammering were it not for goalkeeper Krul.\n\nIn a performance reminiscent of his 2014 World Cup cameo, he saved two penalties against the Red Devils \u2013 just as he did for the Dutch national team against Costa Rica, after coming off the bench in the last minute of extra time.\n\nIf that was his speciality five years ago, here he showed his reflexes are undiminished, with another terrific stop coming to deny Martial from point-blank range when the match was still goalless. Several second-half stops also served to keep the scoreline respectable.\n\nNorwich need more than just a last line of defence, though, and the fact they conceded 21 shots, three goals and two penalties on home soil shows as much.\n\n3) VAR to the fore to overrule the ref\n\nConsidering the number of instances this season in the Premier League which have looked to be penalties, been missed by the officials then deemed not severe enough to be called out by VAR, Sunday presented something of a turn of events.\n\nWhile there shouldn\u2019t be too many dissenting voices regarding the handball decision given against Todd Cantwell, the fact it took several minutes to decide that a coming together between Godfrey and James warranted a spot-kick is surely evidence enough that it wasn\u2019t the fabled clear and obvious error in judgement from the ref to miss it in the first place.\n\nYet again, consistency in decision-making remains at the forefront of the discussion surrounding replays; will future events be similarly scrutinised? And if so, the complaints of Sebastian Haller, Joel Matip, Kevin de Bruyne and others from earlier in the season will only be all the more warranted.\n\n4) Full-back impressions\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka\u2019s recent return to action has come at a good time and his defensive solidity was on display once again for United, making several crucial blocks and showing good recovery pace, even through the centre at times.\n\nAgainst that, Norwich\u2019s pair of young full-backs are already in-demand and will be sought-after if the Canaries fail to avoid the drop this season, though it was certainly Max Aarons who fared better here, both on the ball and defensively, compared to team-mate Jamal Lewis.\n\nWith all that youth, pace and potential on show, a moment of reflection for the fourth full-back in the game, Ashley Young, and his attempts to keep up against the counter-attacks down his flank. A yellow card for a wild late challenge was his biggest contribution.\n\n5) United\u2019s chance to build an unbeaten run\n\nHaving been in the bottom half of the table and on a run of six games without a win in all competitions until recently, perhaps United fans would be feeling happy to take any sort of win at all right now.\n\nBut, with this victory at Carrow Road, United have moved to three without defeat after a draw with Liverpool and a win over Partizan, and suddenly there\u2019s an opportunity to build a real base of positivity.\n\nA League Cup clash at Chelsea will be dictated as much by the teams fielded by each manager as by current form and confidence, but thereafter comes a run of fixtures against Bournemouth, Partizan, Brighton, Sheffield United, Astana and Aston Villa.\n\nThat would see them through to December and, should wins come with frequency against teams who should hold few fears for a team of United\u2019s standing, the mood around Old Trafford may be lifted significantly as we approach the busy festive fixtures.", "description": "Manchester United\u00a0saw off Norwich City\u00a03-1 at Old Trafford in an event-filled Premier League game at Carrow Road.
