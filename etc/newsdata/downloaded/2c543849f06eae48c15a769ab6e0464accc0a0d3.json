Actress Selma Blair now revealing that she's taking more aggressive steps to fight her Ms. Blair has been very open about her health issues and is sharing new details about why she's made this big decision about her treatment. ABC's Stephanie Ramos is back with her story. Stephanie, good morning. Reporter: Whit, good morning. This past year Selma Blair has taken us on her journey, a battle against multiple sclerosis. Her fight has been difficult but she has not shied away from showing us that, and now she's opening up even more about her aggressive treatment that she first rejected. I was kind of out of options. Reporter: Actress Selma Blair speaking at the time 100 health summit reveals why she decided to undergo chemotherapy and an experimental stem cell transplant this summer. The disease modifiers didn't work for me at the time. And I was really declining more rapidly than I found acceptable. Reporter: The 47-year-old says she was initially reluctant to try the aggressive treatment for multiple sclerosis, which is only used when other treatments don't work. Why would I put this horrible drug in chemotherapy -- I don't have cancer. Reporter: But she decided to move forward because of her worsening symptoms. You have more chemo than for cancer patients because the aim is to kind of kill you and it's the stem cells that allow you to live with the amount of chemo. The chemo is what is the Ms cure if, in fact, it dis that. Reporter: Blair who starred in movies like \"Cruel intentions\" and \"Legally blonde\" -- It's a costume party. You probably wouldn't want to come. Reporter: -- Has remained open about her health battles since revealing her diagnosis last year. You're not running and hiding. You're sharing. Reporter: Speaking with robin Roberts shortly after going I was a little scared of talking, and even my neurologist said, no, this will bring a lot of awareness because no one has the energy to talk when they're in full flare-up. But I do because I love a camera. Reporter: Selma telling the crowd at the summit that overall the treatment went smoothly and she's sharing her experience to help others who suffer with chronic diseases. My hair is still not growing in. Neither is mine so -- That's a very small -- we go to the same hairdresser but that was a small thing. I never minded hair loss or any of the things that would be ego involved. I just -- my dream is to lie next to my son at night and be there as long as he needs me and hopefully do something for people. She has shown tremendous courage. Although there is no cure for Ms, there are treatments that can improve flares, reduce occurrence of flares and slow progression of the disease. Chemotherapy drugs aren't typically used to treat multiple sclerosis but sometimes when the disease is severe and other treatments stop working, drugs used to treat cancers may be tried. Now, whit, for Selma she says this has worked for her and that's what matters. For her and her 8-year-old son who is also on this journey with her. Absolutely, Stephanie Ramos, thank you. I mean her courage, her bravery and her humor through all of this is so inspiring. Yeah, it really is. That she's saying she doesn't care so much about ego stuff, it's about wanting to help other people and her kid. Exactly, and she is.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "The actress shared her struggle with multiple sclerosis when she was diagnosed in 2018, after many years of living with mysterious symptoms.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191019_gma_blair2_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
