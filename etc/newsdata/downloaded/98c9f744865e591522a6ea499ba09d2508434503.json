The overwhelming level of student debt has not only added an incredible financial burden to roughly 70 percent of Americans but has increased an overall disinterest in college education.\n\nStudent debt isn\u2019t the only cause of this disinterest, and a free education is far from the answer. The decline of college enrollment is less based on financial reasons, and far more on the fact that students and parents lack the appropriate tools to make the most of this experience.\n\nAs a college president, when I hear \u201cfree education,\u201d I can\u2019t help but see the gaping holes in these extravagant promises. If there is any word that will catch the ears of Americans, it is \u201cfree,\u201d and as the presidential race heats up, we will hear this word more and more. We need a solution to reduce this rising debt. Just as importantly, we need a solution to this growing trend of students struggling to find work and purpose because they were unable to gain an\u2026 education.\n\nJEFF ABERNATHY: ARE YOU READY FOR COLLEGE?\n\nSo before we get so concerned with resolving the massive weight of student debt or strive to become a tuition-free country, why don\u2019t we first get to the root of this issue and understand why it isn\u2019t working?\n\nThe only way higher education can meet the rising demands of a rapidly growing generation is to become as innovative as the rapidly growing job market.\n\nCurrently, fewer than six out of 10 college students graduate in six years. According to the Hechinger Report, a large number of states are predicted to see a decline in college enrollment exceeding over 15 percent between 2025 and 2029. The average student struggles to complete a degree, and more are questioning why they should.\n\nTuition aside, students are growing increasingly unenchanted with their college experience. Over the years, the perceived purpose of higher education has shifted from a practical and holistic preparation for adult life to a niche profession or a quick-fix certification for some desired income. Somehow, we have lost touch with the value of college and the necessity of learning in our lives. While college may not be for everyone, learning is.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe macroeconomic issue of decline in college enrollment goes way beyond financial debt. The biggest struggle lays in equipping young people and families on how to navigate a college career to launch them into a successful future.\n\nOver time, we have misplaced the purpose of a college education and have raised generations of students to misunderstand its value. Perhaps this is partially because we have failed to meet the growing demands and expectations of such an innovative world.\n\nThe only way higher education can meet the rising demands of a rapidly growing generation is to become as innovative as the rapidly growing job market.\n\nIn an interview with The Hechinger Report, Nathan Gawe, economist at Carleton College in Minnesota said, \u201cStudents are going to be a hot commodity, a scarce resource. It\u2019s going to be harder during this period for institutions to aggressively increase tuition. ...The institution\u2019s existence is dependent on meeting the expectations of the student.\u201d\n\nThe only way higher education can meet the rising demands of a rapidly growing generation is to become as innovative as the rapidly growing job market.\n\nMore colleges are taking innovative approaches in expanding their programs to align with the current demands in the job market and the desired professions of students today, even offering more certificates and programs that don\u2019t require a four-year commitment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe thought \u201chigher learning doesn\u2019t apply to me\u201d no longer applies as it once did. The future of learning is quickly evolving with our rapidly changing culture. So when you or your child are seeking the right route to higher education, you don\u2019t have to navigate it feeling left in the dark. Universities and colleges are evolving to offer an education that will be valuable for each individual, and possible for every type of learning.\n\nWhile the future of learning is quickly growing, the value of higher education remains paramount. It just may not always look the same for each student.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DR.
