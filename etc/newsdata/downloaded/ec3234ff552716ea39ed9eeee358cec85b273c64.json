Almost a victory. Almost the best performance of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s reign. Almost better than last season at Paris St Germain. Almost but not quite.\n\nOnly five minutes of normal time were left when Liverpool left-back Andrew Robertson received the ball down his side. All afternoon, United had kept one of their opponents\u2019 most dangerous attacking outlets pinned in his own half on the back of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s clever tactics. All afternoon they had kept Liverpool at bay.\n\nBut at the death United faltered. Robertson\u2019s low cross was decent but had to bypass three United defenders to reach its target. For reasons perhaps only they know, nobody took responsibility and when the ball found Adam Lallana on his own at the far post the Liverpool substitute buried it in the corner.\n\nA late Adam Lallana goal earned Liverpool a point at Old Trafford as the league leaders shared the spoils with Man United\n\nLiverpool had struggled to find a way through a resolute United defence before Lallana guided home a cross for his side\n\nMarcus Rashford latched onto a fine Dan James cross in emphatic fashion to put Manchester United in front at Old Trafford\n\nIt was Rashford's fourth goal of the season for Manchester United and was a huge relief for the youngster who has struggled\n\nRashford celebrates with Ashley Young and Andreas Pereira after ending his goalscoring drought against the league leaders\n\nMATCH FACTS Manchester United (3-5-2) : De Gea; Maguire, Lindelof, Rojo; Young, Fred, McTominay, Pereira (Williams 90+4), Wan-Bisakka; James, Rashford (Martial 84) Subs not used: Garner, Greenwood, Mata, Rojo, Romero Booked: N/A Goals: Rashford (37) Manager: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer Liverpool (4-3-3): Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum (Keita 82); Mane, Firmino, Origi (Oxlade-Chamberlain 60) Subs not used: Gomez, Lallana, Lovren, Milner, Adrian Booked: Fabinho Goals: Lallana (85) Manager: Jurgen Klopp Referee: Martin Atkinson Stadium: Old Trafford\n\nSo a result to change the direction of a season and to change the mood of a football club instead became another illustration of United\u2019s limitations. Solskjaer\u2019s team played well here. They were better for a long period against a strangely tepid, out of sorts Liverpool team.\n\nBut ultimately they didn\u2019t see it through. In the second half they contained Liverpool relatively comfortably but had almost no touches in their opponents\u2019 penalty area. The full-time statistics showed two shots on target, one was Marcus Rashford\u2019s goal and the other was a low 20-yard shot from Scott McTominay that Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson knelt to save comfortably.\n\nPerhaps that is where United are under Solskjaer. A club that has been telling people recently they chose from a list of 804 right-backs before realising there was a decent one playing at Crystal Palace continue to field a team that struggles to hurt people when it really matters.\n\nHad they been a little more potent with the ball, United would have won this. This was their chance. Liverpool\u2019s strangely weak showing coupled with United\u2019s intensity and hard work and Solskjaer\u2019s decision to field a 3-5-2 formation that kept Robertson and right-back Trent Alexander Arnold pinned in deep positions gave the home team an ascendency in the first half that they could never have dreamed of.\n\nBut ultimately it was Liverpool who went home feeling that momentum remains with them, despite the end of a long winning run.\n\nVAR determined that Liverpool attacker Divock Origi was not fouled in the build up to United's opening goal\n\nSadio Mane stroked the ball past David De Gea late on in the first half to level the scores but VAR intervened once again\n\nMane's goal didn't stand as the Video Assistant Referee deemed that the striker handled the ball when through on goal\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was visibly angered at the use of VAR by the officials and expressed his fury to Jon Moss\n\nExperienced referee Martin Atkinson points to his wrist watch as he is advised to rule out Sadio Mane's equaliser for Liverpool\n\nSeason at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool headed back down the East Lancs knowing they can and will play better. United may well look ahead to visits to Belgrade and Norwich later this week and worry what will happen if either opposition have the temerity to score.\n\nHere United\u2019s goal was controversial and for a long time looked as though it would prove to be the story of the day. McTominay fed Daniel James down the right in the 35th minute and when he crossed beautifully in to that area that terrifies goalkeepers, Rashford poked the ball in from six yards.\n\nIt was a classic United counter-attacking goal. At least it was until it became apparent that it had started with what looked like a foul.\n\nAs the VAR officials examined footage of what appeared to be a kick to the back of Divok Origi\u2019s calf by Victor Lindelof before McTominay picked up possession, it seemed very possible that the goal would not stand. But the contact was not deemed significant enough and after a short delay United were ahead.\n\nSolskjaer later described the challenge as a \u2018light touch\u2019 and added that football is a \u2018man\u2019s game\u2019. The United manager was right but had that challenge been made in the box, a penalty would probably have been given.\n\nManchester United displayed an unfamiliar 3-5-2 in a bid to suppress the attacking threat of league leaders Liverpool\n\nLiverpool's Roberto Firmino rolls over after blazing an effort into the Stretford End in the early stages of the game\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp barks out instructions to Andy Robertson as they looked to break down a new look United\n\nSo VAR continues to confuse us all and this time United were on the right end of it as they were when Sadio Mane beat David de Gea at the Stretford End just before half-time only to be denied when the VAR officials spotted a handball.\n\nThat was the right call and Klopp sprinted to the tunnel at the break with rage in his soul and new plans to draw up.\n\nLiverpool \u2013 missing Mo Salah and therefor short of craft \u2013 played with Origi through the middle in the second half and when that didn\u2019t work the Belgian was replaced by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Lallana, another substitute, was introduced with 19 minutes left and Klopp\u2019s use of substitutes was just as influential as its looks on paper.\n\nAlisson Becker was back between the sticks for Liverpool as he returned from a lengthy injury spell to play at Old Trafford\n\nGeorginio Wijnaldum of Liverpool saw a long range effort saved comfortably by United keeper David De Gea at Old Trafford\n\nLiverpool are penalised after Virgil van Dijk drags down Manchester United and England forward Marcus Rashford\n\nManchester United winger Dan James required medical assistance after being winded in a collision with Virgil van Dijk\n\n\u00a380million summer signing Harry Maguire and Marcos Rojo worked hard to quell the threat of star man Sadio Mane\n\nSlowly Liverpool improved but it was marginal. United held firm and occasionally broke from deep. Rashford drove one shot narrowly wide from 18 yards and was terrific all afternoon. There were glimpses here of what the United forward can do when his blood is up and he feels confident enough to run directly at opponents. Solskjaer must draw more of this from the 21\u2013year-old if his team are to improve their wretched scoring record.\n\nUnusually, Klopp\u2019s team had themselves only made one good chance all day \u2013 Roberto Firmino shooting weakly at De Gea shortly before Rashford\u2019s goal \u2013 and were simply not good enough for huge swathes of the game. Salah\u2019s absence really should not hinder them like it did here, nor should an opponent\u2019s desire to sit deep and work frustrate them. At times \u2013 as strange as it sounds when discussing such a free scoring team - Liverpool do look short of a safebreaker.\n\nEventually it was not so much pressure that told as much as it was time. United\u2019s levels of concentration had been terrific all afternoon but at the death they failed them and for the five minutes of added time they were hanging on.\n\nUltimately a relatively positive afternoon yielded just a point and Manchester United are 13th in the Premier League.", "description": "IAN LADYMAN AT OLD TRAFFORD: A late Adam Lallana goal rescued a point for Liverpool in a tense afternoon where VAR took centre stage once again on Sunday afternoon.", "authors": ["Ian Ladyman For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/19/19962656-0-image-a-4_1571596813290.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
