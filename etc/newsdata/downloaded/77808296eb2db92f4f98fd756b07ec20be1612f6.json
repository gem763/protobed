Per a social media post, Rose wrote that the injuries occurred earlier this year, which accounted for a \u201cnew Pez dispenser scar\u201d on her neck. \u201cI was told I needed an emergency surgery or I was risking becoming paralyzed,\u201d she explained. \u201cI had herniated two discs doing stunts, and they were close to severing my spinal chord. I was in chronic pain and yet couldn\u2019t feel my arms.\u201d Rose also included a video of her (pretty graphic) surgery on Instagram and thanked her doctors for a smooth procedure. \u201cDid you not watch that Grey\u2019s Anatomy episode where they left a towel in a patient?\u201d she joked about the video. \u201cAlso I wanted to see what happens when we go under.\u201d\n\nWith Batwoman, Rose made history by becoming the first openly lesbian superhero on television. The show is debuting on October 6.", "description": "Ruby Rose revealed she sustained a serious facial injury while filming the CW\u2019s Batwoman, which left her with permanent damage.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/28/29-ruby.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
