An internet search yields no relevant results.\n\n\u201cHardo has written an elaborate and equal parts luxurious and intelligent illustration book about investment banking \u2014 and would rather think this book to be exactly your cup of tea,\u201d the email continues.\n\nI bite.\n\nA review copy arrives, sent internationally but with a handwritten address. The book is an expensive-looking hardback in faux crocodile skin with gold lettering. It comes with a pair of white gloves for handling, bringing to mind a rare painting being put up for auction.\n\nThe book\u2019s thick pages carry dense, \u2018Where\u2019s Wally/Waldo?\u2019-style illustrations depicting a barely fictional world of Manhattan finance. They are interspersed with essays chronicling a day-in-the-life of a fictional banker, Hardo. It begins in the office and ends with Hardo placing drunken crypto trades in the back of an Uber.\n\nIf anything, I am more confused. What is this book? Who wrote it? And why?\n\n\u2018JP Morgue\u2019\n\nA page in the Hardo & Co book. Photo: Hardo More\n\n\u201cI always was intrigued by the finance space and when I was 11 or 12 I was trading stocks myself,\u201d says the voice down the phone. \u201cWe would have the Financial Times at home in Amsterdam, which was quite rare.\u201d\n\nI am speaking with \u201cHardo\u201d, the mysterious Dutchman behind the book. This is not his real name. He is choosing to remain anonymous for fear of hurting his career. He works in the \u201cprivate equity deal space\u201d in Amsterdam but won\u2019t say much more.\n\nThe mystery author fears his book (full title: \u2018Advanced Valuation Techniques - A modern outlook on complexity and guidance for navigating future financial crises\u2019) might put noses out of joint. Essays throughout the book detail a world obsessed with status, money, and power. Hardo & Co promises \u201cthe highest of financial rewards for nothing but the small cost of some youth and some soul.\u201d Rivals include \u201cGovernment Sachs\u201d, \u201cJP Morgue\u201d, and \u201cDouche Bank\u201d.\n\nA detail from the Hardo book. Photo: Hardo More\n\n\u201cPeople work 80 to 100 hours a week in probably the prime of their youth,\u201d the author says. \u201cI would like some people to really question what they are doing, why they\u2019re doing it, and if it\u2019s really the right place for them?\u201d\n\nStill, he describes the book as a \u201cthe biggest celebratory critique and a critical celebration of the space.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere this is really playing from is the overall sense of self-deprecating humour that is very prevalent in this overall industry,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s satire basically.\u201d\n\nJust like \u2018Where\u2019s Wally/Waldo?\u2019 readers are treated to elaborate illustrations and must hunt for people and objects within them. Example settings include the Hardo & Co. trading floor, a dense Excel spreadsheet, and a finance theme park, which features a Lehman Brothers haunted house.\n\nOn each page, the reader must: Hardo (\u201cHas to deal with being young this late in the cycle\u201d); Hardress (\u201cTold KKR and CVC to call next cycle - again\u201d); the MD (\u201cBlackberry, still misses the pager\u201d); and Warren (\u201cOnly experiences happiness when dividends roll in\u201d). There are also \u201chidden off-balance sheet\u201d items to hunt on each page, such as bitcoin, gold AMEX cards, and expensive wine.", "description": "A new picture book from fictional investment bank \"Hardo & Co.\" has a surprising backstory.
