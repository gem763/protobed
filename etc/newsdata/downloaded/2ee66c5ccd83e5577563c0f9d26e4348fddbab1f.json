In one sense it has never been more visible, from the dual language street signs across Scotland to the time travel blockbuster series Outlander, in which lead actors have learned conversational Gaelic for their roles. Last week, the Scottish government announced \u00a32m funding for a fourth Gaelic primary school in Glasgow, while the city is hosting the Royal National M\u00f2d, Scotland\u2019s foremost Gaelic literature, song and traditional music festival, for the first time in nearly three decades, ending this Saturday.\n\nBrian \u00d3 hEadhra, the arts and culture adviser at B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig, the public body with responsibility for the Gaelic language, counters the pessimism. \u201cWe need more people to use it more often, but we can\u2019t keep focusing on the negatives. We also have to be realistic about the numbers, because this is not just about language but societal shifts, with ongoing population decline in the Gaelic heartlands.\u201d\n\nThis partly informs the B\u00f2rd\u2019s enthusiasm for technology that offers access to a community of fellow speakers across Scotland and indeed the world. Earlier this week it launched a campaign based on a similar Welsh language initiative to encourage Gaelic-speakers to use the hashtag #cleachdi \u2013 or #useit \u2013 to indicate their willingness to converse in the language, and on Thursday the language learning app Duolingo announced that it was making Gaelic available to its 300 million-plus users.\n\nBut \u00d3 Giollag\u00e1in remains sceptical: \u201cThis is about what gets attention: the focus is on media, schools, the arts, but there is no social policy supporting the speaker group itself. For example, we know that the most important thing for continuity of a language is transfer from one generation to the next, but there is no family support scheme for speakers.\u201d\n\n\u201cEncouraging people to learn Gaelic is, of course, to be welcomed, but emphasising this to the detriment of the obvious concerns of the existing vernacular community only serves to undermine the credibility of Gaelic policy in general.\u201d\n\nWhile there has been a huge increase in children attending Gaelic medium education, and there are now as many doing so in Glasgow as across the Highlands, the numbers are still relatively small \u2013 1,032 in Glasgow, 427 in Edinburgh and 1145 in the Highlands in 2018 \u2013 and it has yet to translate into more taking Gaelic language qualifications at secondary school level.\n\nCritics have suggested that Gaelic schools often benefit middle-class children whose parents are taken with the educational advantages of dual language learning.\n\nFiona Dunn, Glasgow University\u2019s Gaelic development manager who ran a recent conference on Gaelic in the global and digital age, said: \u201cA lot of parents are drawn to Gaelic schools in the cities because they have a very good reputation and the full support of the local authority which is so important, and not always evident across the country. It is critical that we have strong leadership from Gaelic policymakers that supports the needs of more rural areas too.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the first generation of children from non-Gaelic speaking backgrounds to benefit from Gaelic medium education are coming of age, and some are struggling to integrate the language into social life.\n\nFrances Driscoll, 20, is an art student at Edinburgh University and attended Gaelic medium education from nursery level in Glasgow, along with her two sisters.\n\nShe describes encountering the Gaelic Society at Freshers\u2019 Week, which offered a tartan-themed pub crawl and a mixture of traditional music players and \u201cAmericans interested in Outlander\u201d. She added: \u201cI hardly ever use Gaelic now, and none of my social group speak it.\u201d\n\nB\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig acknowledges the challenges faced by \u201cscattered speakers\u201d, and hopes to progress to the kind of network of walk-in language hubs under construction in Ireland.\n\nBut Driscoll warns: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be more and more kids having the same experience. Traditional Gaelic culture is really rich but there has to be an alternative way of using the language in a social setting. There should be more emphasis in schools on trying to normalise and promote it as a way to communicate, otherwise its just associated with essay-writing.\u201d", "description": "Language at a crossroads as children flock to schools in urban areas", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb310fece773e3e1ccac0ee045c2e31cef23314b/0_50_6631_3978/master/6631.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f145e6eaf8a53807fc0991322c28bd1a", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
