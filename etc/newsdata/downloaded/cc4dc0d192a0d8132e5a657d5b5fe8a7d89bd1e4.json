We have no bloody idea, but this cast list is so wild that we wouldn\u2019t rule anything out at this point.\n\nJames Gunn directed the first two Guardians Of The Galaxy films, but was fired by Marvel and Disney after a controversy around his old Tweets.\n\nDC and Warner Bros quickly snapped him up to bring his particular brand of spectacle to Suicide Squad, THEN Marvel and Disney hired him again for the upcoming Guardians 3.\n\nNeedless to say, the guy has a lot on his plate at the moment. Little else is known about the story or characters of Suicide Squad 2 but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be hearing more very soon.", "description": "Pete Davidson and Taika Waititi are two of the big names confirmed in the cast announcement for James Gunn's 'Suicide Squad 2'.", "authors": ["Alasdair Duncan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/PeteDavidsonTaikaWaititiFB.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
