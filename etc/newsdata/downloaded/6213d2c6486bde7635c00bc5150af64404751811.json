The Spanish government immediately seized control of the Catalan administration and the ringleaders were put on trial.\n\nThe Supreme Court found nine politicians and activists guilty of sedition on Monday and sentenced them to up to 13 years in jail, sparking increasingly violent demonstrations.\n\nBarcelona town hall said 400 garbage containers were set ablaze on Wednesday and estimated that the city had suffered damage totaling more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) in two days of unrest.
