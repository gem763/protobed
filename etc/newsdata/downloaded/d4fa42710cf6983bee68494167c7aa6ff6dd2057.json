Frese was apparently romantically involved with one of the reporters.\n\nAccording to the Post, the man\u2019s \u201calleged motive apparently was to advance the career of the female reporter with whom he had a relationship, the FBI said in a court affidavit. Frese allegedly passed additional top-secret information to one of the woman\u2019s colleagues at \u2018an affiliated but different news outlet.' Although authorities Wednesday withheld the names of the two journalists, the affidavit and indictment describe Twitter messages and online articles that offer a road map to their identities. The reporters appear to be Amanda Macias of CNBC and Courtney Kube of MSNBC, both of whom cover national security.\"\n\nCNBC reported that one of the journalists who received top-secret information from Frese wrote at least eight articles based on the sensitive information. Frese is charged with two counts of willful transmission of national defense information.\n\nThe Justice Department told CNBC, \u201cthe unauthorized disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause serious harm to the national security of the United States.\u201d\n\nIf convicted, Frese faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 years for each of his two counts.", "description": "A counterterrorism analyst has been charged with leaking top-secret information to two journalists..10/09/2019 22:43:20PM EST.", "authors": ["Bronson Stocking", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/112/45c1d9b7-b404-4eea-bb48-f6a8a04ce90a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
