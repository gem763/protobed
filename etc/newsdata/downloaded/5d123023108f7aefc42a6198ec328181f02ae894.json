Gee, flies in on Air Force 2 with his father, the vice president. \u2026 So China gives his son $1.5 billion. How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d \u2014 Minneapolis rally Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: There\u2019s no evidence Hunter Biden pocketed $1.5 billion from China. More generally, accusations of criminal wrongdoing by father or son are unsubstantiated.\n\nIn 2014, an investment fund started by Hunter Biden and other investors joined with foreign and Chinese private equity firms in an effort to raise $1.5 billion to invest outside China. That\u2019s far from giving Hunter Biden such a sum, as Trump describes it.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s lawyer, George Mesires, told the PolitiFact website that his client was an unpaid director of the fund at the time and it ended up raising less than one-third of its target.\n\nTrump\u2019s attempt to press Ukraine to investigate the Bidens is at the center of the impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s activities in office; Trump also has called for China to investigate them. Joe Biden is contending for the 2020 Democratic nomination to run against Trump.\n\n___\n\nIMPEACHMENT\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAdam should be Impeached!\u201d \u2014 tweet Tuesday.\n\nTRUMP, on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee: \u201cNancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech \u2026This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors \u2026 I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly \u2018Colluded\u2019 with them, must all be immediately Impeached!\u201d \u2014 tweet Sunday.\n\nTHE FACTS: There\u2019s no danger that either Schiff or Pelosi, who last month launched impeachment proceedings against Trump, will be impeached themselves. That\u2019s because House members cannot be impeached under the Constitution.\n\nThe House does have the power to expel one of its members by a two-thirds vote, but there are little grounds for it based on what Trump alleges.\n\nTrump\u2019s reference to a \u201cfraudulent speech\u201d comes from remarks Schiff made last month at a committee hearing, when he mocked the president\u2019s pleas in his July call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nSchiff said his remarks were a parody, reflecting the \u201cessence\u201d of what he believed Trump was conveying to Zelenskiy, \u201cshorn of its rambling character.\u201d\n\nTrump routinely mocks critics, as he did in this tweet, and invents dialogue that he attributes to them.\n\nThe House has expelled only five of its own, based on charges of members supporting the Confederacy during the Civil War or bribery and corruption.\n\n___\n\nSYRIA and TURKEY\n\nTRUMP, on removing U.S. troops from Syria: \u201cI was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don\u2019t even like the USA. The two most unhappy countries at this move are Russia & China, because they love seeing us bogged\u2026down.\u201d \u2014 tweets Monday.\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s a dubious reading of Russia, in particular.\n\nBoth Russia and Iran stand to gain from a U.S. troop withdrawal and will probably bide their time until they can move in and retake the area. With their help, Syrian President Bashar Assad has recaptured most of the Syrian territory except for the north and east.\n\nIran and Russia are both key allies of Assad\u2019s government with troops on the ground in Syria. While they may publicly oppose a Turkish incursion into Syria , they probably don\u2019t mind an operation that diminishes the U.S.-allied Kurdish forces.\n\nSome of Turkey\u2019s incursions into Syria appeared to have been coordinated with Russia and Iran.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\u201d \u2014 tweet Thursday.\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWhen I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\u201d \u2014 tweet Monday.\n\nTHE FACTS: His claim of a 100% defeat is misleading because the Islamic State group still poses a threat.\n\nIS was defeated in Iraq in 2017, then lost the last of its land holdings in Syria in March, marking the end of the extremists\u2019 self-declared caliphate.\n\nStill, extremist sleeper cells have continued to launch attacks in Iraq and Syria and are believed to be responsible for targeted killings against local officials and members of the Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nIS controlled large swathes of northern and eastern Syria, where they declared a caliphate in 2014 along with large parts of neighboring Iraq.\n\nU.N. experts warned in August that IS leaders are aiming to consolidate and create conditions for an \u201ceventual resurgence in its Iraqi and Syrian heartlands.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cSo many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States, in fact they make the structural steel frame for our F-35 Fighter Jet.\u201d \u2014 tweet Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Actually, Turkey won\u2019t be providing the steel for U.S. F-35 fighter jets much longer.\n\nThe Trump administration removed Turkey from the F-35 program in July because the Turks refused to cancel the purchase of a Russian S-400 air defense system that is incompatible with NATO forces. At the time, the White House said the S-400 would compromise the F-35 program and aid Russian intelligence.\n\nAs part of that process, the U.S. said it will stop using any Turkish supplies and parts by March.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, \u2026including capturing thousands of ISIS fighters, mostly from Europe. But Europe did not want them back, they said you keep them USA!\u201d \u2014 tweet Monday.\n\nTRUMP: \u201cMost of them came from Europe.\u201d \u2014 Minneapolis rally.\n\nTHE FACTS: Not true. The foreign fighters captured and being held by the U.S.-allied Kurds are not mostly from Europe, which Trump has argued could easily reclaim them.\n\nOf the more than 12,000 IS fighters in custody in Kurdish areas, only 2,500 are from outside the region of the conflict, some from Europe, some from other parts of the world. But most of captured fighters \u2014 about 10,000 \u2014 are natives of Syria or Iraq.\n\nTrump has said it will now be up to countries in the region to decide what to do with captured fighters.\n\n___\n\nJUDGES\n\nTRUMP, criticizing Barack Obama\u2019s struggle to win confirmation of federal judges as president, contends \u201cthey were unable to fill 142 important Federal Judgeships (a record by far), handing them all to me to choose.\u201d \u2014 tweet Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: First, his number is false. So is his insinuation that Obama couldn\u2019t fill judicial vacancies due to complacency.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Trump has a stronger record than Obama so far in picking federal judges. But it was due to unprecedented lack of action by the Republican-controlled Senate on Democrat Obama\u2019s judicial nominees in his last two years in office. That left Trump more vacancies to fill.\n\nOf the 71 people whom Obama nominated to the district courts and courts of appeals in 2015 and 2016, only 20 were voted on and confirmed, said Russell Wheeler, an expert on judicial nominees at the Brookings Institution. Trump entered office in January 2017 with under 110 vacancies on the federal bench \u2014 not 142 as he asserts \u2014 about double the number Obama had in 2009.\n\nTrump has since been aided by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has pushed through Trump\u2019s nominations of appeals court judges in particular.\n\n___\n\nECONOMY\n\nTRUMP: \u201cIf our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now, China would be the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world. And right now, I can tell you, they\u2019re not even close.\u201d \u2014 Minneapolis rally.\n\nTRUMP: \u201cSo I think China might have caught us if my opponent had gotten in. By now, they would have caught us. And now it\u2019s going to be a long time before they catch us, if they ever catch us. I don\u2019t think anybody is going to catch us.\u201d \u2014 remarks Monday on trade .\n\nTHE FACTS: No matter who got elected in 2016 \u2014 Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton \u2014 there is no way China\u2019s economy would have caught up with America\u2019s by now.\n\nEven if the U.S. economy hadn\u2019t grown at all since 2016, China\u2019s gross domestic product \u2014 the broadest measure of economic output \u2014 would have had to have surged a fantastical 79% in three years to have pulled even with America\u2019s. That comes to growth of more than 21% a year \u2014 something even China\u2019s super-charged economy has never approached.\n\nMoreover, despite Trump\u2019s suggestion that China can\u2019t ever catch up, the Chinese economy continues to slowly narrow the gap because every year it grows much faster than America\u2019s. In 2019, for example, the International Monetary Fund expects Chinese GDP to increase 6.2%, more than double the 2.6% growth it expects for the United States.\n\n___\n\nRONNA MCDANIEL, Republican National Committee chair: \u201cNew data is out on median income growth: Under Barack Obama, incomes rose $11 a month. Under @realDonaldTrump, incomes are rising at $161 a month. That\u2019s huge!\u201d \u2014 tweet Monday, retweeted by Trump.\n\nTHE FACTS: This comparison is misleading.\n\nMcDaniel didn\u2019t provide her data source. But her statement obscures the track records of both presidents and the economic conditions that their administrations inherited.\n\nFor the first two full years of Trump\u2019s presidency, the Census Bureau shows that median household income has been growing by a monthly average of $58, to $63,179 in 2018. That\u2019s almost one-third of what claimed in McDaniel\u2019s tweet.\n\nUnder Obama, incomes rose at a monthly average of only $31. But that average includes Obama\u2019s first term, when the economy was dealing with the ravages from the Great Recession that began before he became president. Trump took office at a moment when the economy was relatively healthy.\n\nObama\u2019s track record improved sharply after 2012, as the recovery took hold. Median incomes during that period rose at a monthly average of $122. That is more than double the income growth during Trump\u2019s first two years.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAs you know, in addition to what we\u2019re talking about today, they\u2019re building \u2014 Japan \u2014 many car plants in the United States, which they weren\u2019t doing for a long time. And they\u2019re building in Michigan, Ohio, lots of different states. And we just appreciate it very much. Been a tremendous investment.\u201d \u2014 remarks Monday on trade.\n\nTHE FACTS: Not true. Japanese automakers are not building \u201cmany\u201d car plants in the U.S. No Japanese automakers are building assembly plants in Michigan, and Honda is making only a small investment at an existing facility in Anna, Ohio, near Dayton. Honda has announced it will build a hybrid SUV at a factory in Greensburg, Indiana, but that investment is $4.2 million and will add 34 new jobs.\n\nThe only major assembly plant being built now by Japanese automakers in the U.S. is the Toyota-Mazda factory in Alabama, which is expected to employ 4,000 people and will start producing vehicles in 2021.\n\nNormally, parts-making companies set up operations in or near the main assembly plant, and that\u2019s happening in Huntsville. Six companies are investing about $491 million in the area, creating an expected 1,765 jobs, according to Toyota.\n\nEarlier this year, Japanese truck maker Hino opened a new assembly plant in Mineral Wells, West Virginia, investing $100 million and creating 250 jobs. It replaced an older facility that also was in West Virginia.\n\nTrump is also wrong to suggest recent construction from Japanese car companies in the U.S. is somehow new. Japanese automakers have been building in the U.S. since the 1970s and have expanded manufacturing over the years. The companies have announced millions in investments to retool existing plants to make new models.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Paul Wiseman, Josh Boak, Robert Burns, Christopher Rugaber and Stephen Braun in Washington, Tom Krisher in Detroit and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump spread shoddy information about Syria, the economy and matters at the heart of the impeachment inquiry against", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/12/f48549_trump-78679-donald-trump-president-donald-trump-stands-ceremony-present-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
