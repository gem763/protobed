For industrial and commercial entities, it wants to remove humans from the equation entirely, letting them rely on its obstacle-dodging, self-flying technology for automated mapping and surveillance.\n\nTo that end, it\u2019s announcing the Skydio 2 Dock, a drone-in-a-box solution that theoretically lets the Skydio 2 fly mission after mission all by itself. As you can see in the video above, it\u2019s got a motorized door and slide-out arm that the drone can land on as well as a built-in charging station for a special version of the Skydio 2\u2019s battery with contact pins on the bottom.\n\nSkydio co-founder Adam Bry tells me that his drone can find its way back to the box without GPS, thanks to its visual and inertial navigation systems, and it can land precisely on that pad time after time, thanks to a pair of visual markers on top. He wouldn\u2019t tell me how long they\u2019ve tested it at a stretch, but he showed me a video of it landing while blasted with a 25 mph gust of wind from a leaf blower. Bry says it should be able to do that in practice.\n\nThe weatherproof box is also designed to hold the drone securely for transport. Bry says it\u2019ll work as carry-on luggage, and there\u2019s a Wi-Fi- and Ethernet-connected computer to automatically beam data back home after each mission \u2014 missions that will likely be flown through Skydio partner DroneDeploy to start. You can plug the box into a normal AC outlet, or into 12V DC power if you wanted to mount it to an SUV or truck. \u201cMounting this to a work vehicle or a first responder\u2019s vehicle makes a lot of sense, and that\u2019s why we want to have the 12V DC option,\u201d says Bry.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not the first drone dock we\u2019ve seen or even the first drone-in-a-box. We introduced you to Sunflower Labs\u2019 drone surveillance system for homeowners in 2018, and Percepto has a drone-in-a-box system called Sparrow that was chosen to inspect an Italian power plant last May. Here\u2019s a cool video of that one:\n\nSkydio\u2019s dock doesn\u2019t swap out the battery, unlike some. It\u2019ll only charge it at normal speed, which can take about an hour.\n\nOf course, a system like this won\u2019t be much use yet in the United States or other drone-restrictive countries where laws require drones to have a human pilot who can see the aircraft at all times. Percepto\u2019s press release actually mentions that the drone flying over the Italian power plant is still supervised by a human operator, \u201cas Italy\u2019s regulatory framework does not currently allow fully autonomous drone flight.\u201d\n\nFor many mapping and surveillance missions, you also wouldn\u2019t necessarily need Skydio\u2019s main selling point of obstacle avoidance. Just fly a drone up high enough, and it can see what you need to photograph far below. But Skydio says its drone can account for changes that would frustrate other systems, like how the cranes at a construction site will move around.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Bry claims the Skydio 2 Dock will be cheaper than anything else on the market. While other options can cost \u201cmany tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars,\u201d he says the Dock will be \u201cvastly more accessible than any other drone-in-a-box solution that has been talked about.\u201d\n\nBut he won\u2019t say how much it will cost or when it\u2019ll launch, except that it\u2019ll be a slow rollout with select customers early next year. As you can see in our video tour of Skydio\u2019s facilities below, the company only has a tiny assembly line building everything it makes. It only took one day for that assembly line to hit capacity for all the drones it\u2019ll ship by the end of the year.", "description": "With the Skydio 2 Dock, a drone-in-a-box solution, the California startup wants to let companies rely on its obstacle-dodging, self-flying drone for automated mapping and surveillance \u2014 no humans needed.", "authors": ["Sean Hollister", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9L-NObxP85BcbVvotPVlcT4m5bU=/0x131:3341x1880/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19293003/Skydio_Dock_Takeoff__1_.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
