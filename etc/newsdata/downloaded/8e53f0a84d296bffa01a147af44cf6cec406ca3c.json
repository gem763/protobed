I would have been useless on my own.\"\n\nBobbie was looking through some of her Ibiza holiday photos when she came across a picture of her at Pacha, and was shocked after realising her missing passport was on the floor right in front of her.\n\n(Image: Jam Press)\n\nShe said: \"On the last day of being there I was looking back at all the photos I'd taken this holiday.\n\n\"I came across the pictures I tweeted about and noticed the passport, I was in so much shock but couldn't help but laugh for ages.\n\n\"I was sending it to all my friends, posting it on my stories and everyone found it hilarious, I just don't know how I didn't open my eyes.\n\n\"All of this could have been avoided if I just checked the photo after taken it and seeing my passport lying there on the floor haha!\n\n\"Even though I had so much bad luck happen this holiday, I had the best time and I will never forget this situation!\"", "description": "Bobbie Cook, 21, was in Ibiza superclub Pacha when the document dropped to the floor", "authors": ["Dave Burke", "Image", "Jam Press"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20585459.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Ibiza-reveller-loses-passport-only-to-spot-it-on-the-floor-when-looking-back-on-photos-after-wild-ni.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
