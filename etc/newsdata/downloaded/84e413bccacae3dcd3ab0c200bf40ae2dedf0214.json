She also teased fans by saying she had a big announcement to make and invited fans to guess what it was but the tweet has since been removed.\n\nFloersch is currently competing in the inaugural Formula Regional European Championship. She is in sixth place overall in the drivers\u2019 standings in the competition for Formula Three drivers.\n\nSophia Floersch steers her Van Amersfroot Racing car during a Van Amersfroot Racing team test driving at the Monza racetrack, northern Italy in March, four months after her crash.

Last year, Van Amersfoort sent three drivers to Macau and it remains to be seen whether the Netherlands-based team will send all four drivers who are competing in the Formula Regional European Championship next month.\n\nThe ambitious Floersch, who aspires to become \u201cthe first female world champion in a man\u2019s world\u201d is one of four drivers for Van Amersfoort Racing, which is led by Britain\u2019s Dan Ticktum, the two-time reigning Macau Grand Prix champion.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Sport recently, Floersch recalled the pivotal moment when her car went airborne during last year\u2019s Macau Grand Prix that shocked thousands in the grandstands at Lisboa Bend and millions watching the drama unfold on TV.\n\n\u201cI remember flying, I remember everything. I brake, my hands came off the steering wheel and I went into the wall on the right side first, which turned me around so I went backwards,\u201d she told BBC Sport.\n\n\u201cThere were those big sausage curbs, they made me fly and then I hit the fence, then the house [photographer\u2019s bunker].\n\n\u201cThe crash was horrible, I\u2019ve watched it so many times. It\u2019s OK now and also I think talking about it helps. The sport is not the safest but in the end, I am still here.\u201d", "description": "The brave 18-year-old racing car driver underwent 11 hours of surgery and returned to the track four months later.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/0892ac1e-ef38-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires115202.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
