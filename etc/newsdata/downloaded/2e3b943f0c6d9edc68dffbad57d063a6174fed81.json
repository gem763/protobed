At Cap de Creus, where gnarly, pockmarked rocks dominate the coastline, rough sea the colour of petrol roars to shore, whipped up by the wild Tramuntana winds. At its southern bay sits Cadaques, the remote painterly town often described as one of Spain\u2019s finest. Painters Picasso, Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp were all drawn to its modest beauty. And so too was Salvador Dali.\n\nIt\u2019s been three decades this year since the man and moustache passed onto Surrealist heaven, but you\u2019re never far from his presence in this beatific slice of Spain. I\u2019m on a pilgrimage of sorts, exploring Dali\u2019s life in the most intimate way possible. Forget gimmicks: out here in the countryside, nature reveals more about the maestro than any book might bluster. Even a cursory glance at the man\u2019s output \u2013 from the opening scene of Un Chien Andalou, to ever-present Pyrenean peaks \u2013 tells you just how influential this environment was.\n\nOn the road to Figueres, Dali\u2019s birthplace, past gilded fields and perfect hay bales, you quickly spot the shapes and motifs that repeatedly feature in his work. The smart market town is bright and lively, but completely overshadowed by its most famous attraction, the audaciously kitsch Dali Theatre-Museum. To sceptics the \u201cegg and bread castle\u201d is a pretentious edifice to vanity, but you\u2019d have to be pretty po-faced not to be enthralled by its pomp and ceremony. Many of the artist\u2019s most pored-over works \u2013 The Persistence of Memory, and Prog-rock poster Metamorphosis of Narcissus, are conspicuous by their absence. But what it lacks in subtlety is all for the better.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It\u2019s where the elderly artist, dogged by bad health, lived out his final years. \u201cHe wanted to be at the heart of all he created,\u201d she tells me, \u201cand because he was born in Figueres it was like coming full circle.\u201d\n\nOver the next couple of days, I encounter a number of people who claim to have known him, but Ms Agur is the only one I believe. \u201cI would read him A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking while he lay on the bed over there, and he in turn would recall the landscapes of his youth. To me, Dali was the landscape.\u201d\n\nI feel odd when I wake the next day. At the end of the bed, a large painted screen of Mae West\u2019s Face suddenly splits in two, revealing a view of remarkable, if somewhat distorted, proportions. The Bay of Roses outside is wider than a mile and mill pond calm. At this time of the morning the beaches look almost spectral, something not lost on Dali and many of his most haunting images.\n\nI\u2019m at the Hotel Vistabella in the Surrealist suite. This is less a hotel room, more a bonkers flight of fancy \u2013 a vast, disorientating space, replete with melting clocks, sunken bath, and as many golden eggs as the goose could muster. It is both sublime and ridiculous, and all manner of fun could be choreographed within its stark white interior. Over breakfast, the strains of Englebert Humperdinck\u2019s Quando, Quando, Quando float through the room, begging the question: when will the madness end?\n\nOf course, no one in Catalonia should bypass the town of Cadaques, which is every bit as fabulous as you\u2019ve been told. As a child, Dali spent endless summers in its grasp, declaring this Costa Brava jewel \u201cthe most beautiful village in the world\u201d. Today it retains an ageless charm, a place of shifting light, natural freedom and a clutch of impressively upscale restaurants. L\u2019Hostal was a favourite of the artist\u2019s but I wager he\u2019d be more impressed by Compartir, a chic outdoor terrace manned by effusive waiters serving delicately artful food. The crack kitchen squad all hail from el Bulli, former best restaurant in the world, so you know plato combinados are off the menu. Gorge instead on \u201cbleeding\u201d mussels and tongue-slicing razor clams.\n\nIt\u2019s a 15-minute walk from here to Portlligat, the sleepy bay punctuated by Dali\u2019s famous white villa. The house was a vital sanctuary where he could concentrate and create, but any resemblance to a normal abode ends there. Originally a fisherman\u2019s barraca, the place grew over the years into a grand whitewashed curio with multiple extensions, a place he and enigmatic wife Gala would fill with stuffed animals and obtuse antiques. Dali liked to say he was the first man in Spain to see the sun rise each morning. With a strategically hung mirror in the bedroom, and the fact this is the most easterly point in Spain, who would dare disagree with the great exaggerator?\n\nI head south, inland to Pubol, an ancient, almost narcoleptic village where time stands still and only grasshoppers break the silence. As a token of love, Dali bought and gifted the Castell de Pubol to Gala who had grown tired of increasing public attention. She accepted on one condition \u2013 that he visit by written permission only. Well into her eighties, Gala was welcoming lovers into this lair, free to roam its lush gardens, full of stone elephants and strange forced perspective. I\u2019m more taken by the remnants of a past life \u2013 the bright orange Datsun in the drive, the classical 8-track cartridge tapes.\n\nOver in Begur, at the cobalt cove of Cala d\u2019Aiguafreda, a group of Andalucian construction workers are busy frying octopus, getting steadily drunk on cheap red wine. In that inimitable Spanish way, they\u2019re celebrating St Anthony, patron saint of builders. It\u2019s 10.30 in the morning. Overlooking this merry tableaux, shrouded by pine trees, is Sa Rascassa, a chic fish restaurant and button-cute hostel, where excellent host Oscar Gorriz and his wife Merche have spun a little rural fantasy. Dali would surely have approved.\n\nGenius? Dilettante? Or a lobster\u2019s claw of both?\n\n\u201cSi no existiera, habr\u00eda que inventarlo,\u201d muses Oscar. \u201cIf it did not exist, it would have to be invented.\u201d\n\nTravel essentials\n\nGetting there\n\nRyanair flies to Girona from 13 UK airports; flights from \u00a354 return.\n\nStaying there\n\nThe Surrealist Suite at Hotel Vistabella costs from \u00a3529, B&B.\n\nSa Rascassa has double rooms from \u00a3152, B&B.\n\nMore information\n\ncatalunya.com\n\nsalvador-dali.org", "description": "The further north you drive in Catalonia the more beguiling and dramatic it becomes.
