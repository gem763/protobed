REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\n\nThe trade body for banks in Britain published the sector\u2019s first major appraisal of the senior managers and certification regime (SMCR) introduced in 2016 as part of reforms implemented after the 2007-09 financial crisis that left taxpayers to bail out lenders while few individual bankers faced punishment.\n\nSMCR makes it easier for regulators to pinpoint blame when things go wrong.\n\nBarclays Chief Executive Jes Staley was the first to be punished under the regime when he was fined a combined 1.1 million pounds ($1.4 million) last year for trying to identify a whistleblower who had sent letters criticising an employee of the bank.\n\nUK Finance said the report - compiled with law firm Ashurst and based on a survey of 60 senior managers across 25 banking institutions - showed that banks are now more cautious about taking risks and are committed to implementing SMCR.\n\n\u201cOur report shows that since the introduction of the SMCR there has been a meaningful and tangible change in culture, behaviour and attitudes towards risk,\u201d UK Finance said.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the SMCR has focused senior managers\u2019 minds in terms of individual responsibility, but there is less evidence that others within firms have a similar focus.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has said that measurement of improvements in culture is still in its infancy.\n\nBritain was first to implement such a system, raising concerns among banks that regulators wanted \u201cheads on sticks\u201d.\n\nBut Tuesday\u2019s report found that banks could still attract staff and that lenders have benefited from a clearer view of roles and responsibilities, UK Finance said.\n\nThe report also called for regulators to introduce a lighter version of SMCR for smaller banks and building socieities in an effort to alleviate some of the \u201cdisproportionate regulatory burden\u201d imposed by the common approach for all lenders.\n\nIt also wants regulators to replace the demand for continual updates of who does what at a bank with less burdensome semi-annual or annual updates.\n\nSenior managers should also have a right to access their records in the event of a regulatory investigation after they have left a bank, the report recommended.", "description": "Britain's new system of banker accountability has led to a \"tangible\" improvement in culture but modest changes are still needed, UK Finance said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428123902&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8821P", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
