This allowed the young finches to learn parts of song which they were not taught by their parents.\n\nIt is hoped the findings will yield clues on where to look in the human brain to improve our understanding of conditions which affect language like autism.\n\nTodd Roberts, a neuroscientist who conducted the research at the UTSW's O'Donnell Brain Institute, said in a press release : \"This is the first time we have confirmed brain regions that encode behavioral-goal memories -- those memories that guide us when we want to imitate anything from speech to learning the piano.\"\n\nRead More", "description": "Scientists have artificially altered the song of young birds by implanting song memories into their brains with light pulses, in a discovery which may lead to developments in the treatment of humans with speech difficulties.", "authors": ["Rory Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191008060253-zebra-finch-stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
