It\u2019s a bit like climate change. We recognise it but it takes decades for anything to happen.\n\n\u201cWe know that children are not getting the skills they need.\n\n\u201cThe world has changed, we have robots, the internet, AI, and so forth. But we still educate children the way we did when we grew up.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big issue. We need a fundamental change to the learning environment around children.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the full discussion in the video player, above.", "description": "Fundamental change is needed to help children learn the skills needed to meet transformations in the way we work, a panel moderated by Euronews has heard.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/89/46/1000x563_cmsv2_874f51e4-8636-5a33-8ec1-cf6a831319d5-4208946.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
