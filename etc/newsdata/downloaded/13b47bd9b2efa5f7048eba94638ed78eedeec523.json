For instance, you have to go to the settings app to change the resolution and frame rate of the video you\u2019re shooting.\n\nBut that might change soon. Apple is now allowing you to change the resolution and frame rate right from the camera UI with its latest iOS 13.2 developer beta update. Unfortunately, this option is available for only this year\u2019s iPhones: the iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max.\n\n\ud83e\udd2f It happened! Now in iOS 13.2 Beta 2 you can change the video resolution and frame rate right in the camera app just by tapping on the setting! \ud83e\udd29 Why this incredible \"Pro\" feature is available on other not so \"Pro\" iPhones? \ud83d\ude2e pic.twitter.com/SJjSEAD7rn \u2014 Ben Geskin (@BenGeskin) October 10, 2019\n\nFrankly, this was a much need update, but it\u2019s a bummer that older iPhones can\u2019t use it. However, it\u2019s just in developer beta at the moment, and it\u2019s possible that Apple rolls it out for older iPhones in the stable version of the update. Let\u2019s hope for the best.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FFrame-rate-iPhone.png&signature=83fb6fbaf82f8cf25e774c4821dd6bc8", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
