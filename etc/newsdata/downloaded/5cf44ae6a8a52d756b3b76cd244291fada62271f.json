It\u2019s new. Everything\u2019s good. It\u2019s got massive meeting rooms. Unlimited for security, because it is on, you know, hundreds of acres.

And I was like, that's not the craziest idea. It makes perfect sense.\"\n\nPHOTO: In this April 3, 2018, file photo, a view leading into Trump National Doral is seen in Miami, Fla. (Michele Eve Sandberg/AFP/Getty Images, FILE) More\n\nTrump reversed course just two days later, announcing via tweet that he was rescinding his decision to host the G-7 at Doral due to what he called \u201cCrazed and Irrational Hostility\u201d from the press and Democratic party. Trump, however, was reportedly swayed by disapproval from members of his own party.\n\n\"He was honestly surprised at the level of pushback,\" Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cI think it's the right decision to change. We'll have to find someplace else.\"\n\n....Therefore, based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020. We will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately. Thank you! \u2014 Donald J.
