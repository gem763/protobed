(AP) - John Walker, an Arkansas lawmaker and civil rights attorney who represented black students in a long-running court fight over the desegregation of Little Rock area schools, has died. He was 82.\n\nThe Pulaski County coroner said Walker died at his Little Rock home Monday morning but the cause of death was not yet known. Funeral arrangements are pending.\n\nWalker, a Democrat, had represented a Little Rock district in the state House since 2011. He had been involved in some of the state\u2019s most high-profile discrimination and civil rights cases, including the desegregation case, which stemmed from a 1982 lawsuit the Little Rock school district filed against the state and neighboring districts over racial disparities that remained decades after the 1957 integration of Central High School.\n\n\u201cWhat he did in this state made a difference for everyone in this state,\u201d state Sen. Joyce Elliott, chairwoman of the Legislative Black Caucus. \u201cI don\u2019t think everyone will realize the full measure of that for quite some time.\u201d\n\nFederal judges have ruled Little Rock and North Little Rock schools substantially complied with a 1998 desegregation plan, and the two remaining districts in the case are seeking release.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton praised Walker as a \u201cdevoted public servant who spent his life fighting to give all Arkansans the opportunity to succeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the courtroom to the Capitol, he never wavered in his pursuit of justice or his belief that a democracy only works when everyone can participate fully,\u201d Clinton said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for his more than 40 years of friendship and the way he lived his life, giving and serving until the very end.\u201d\n\nWalker had also represented former Razorbacks basketball coach Nolan Richardson in his unsuccessful lawsuit against the University of Arkansas challenging his 2002 firing. Richardson had claimed he was fired because he was black and that his free-speech rights were violated.\n\n\u201cHe was always the underdog, but would fight to be on top,\u201d Richardson said Monday.\n\nIn recent years, Walker criticized the state\u2019s 2015 takeover of the Little Rock School District because of low test scores at several schools. A federal judge in 2016 dismissed a lawsuit filed by Walker and other attorneys that claimed the takeover was motivated by racial discrimination. The state earlier this month voted to return control of the district to a local board that will be elected in November 2020.\n\n\u201cJohn always was a gentleman and proved every day that you can get along with people even though there may be disagreements,\u201d Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in a statement. \u201cHe worked tirelessly for the causes he championed and for the people he represented.\u201d\n\nWalker spoke out in the House whenever he believed legislation\u2019s impact on African-Americans wasn\u2019t being considered, and was an outspoken opponent of voter ID requirements. A 2013 voter ID law was struck down by the state Supreme Court, but the Republican Legislature passed a reworked version in 2017 and voters last year placed the requirement in the state\u2019s constitution.\n\n\u201cI dare say you\u2019ll find any of your colleagues in this body of my color who will support this,\u201d Walker said from the House floor as he opposed the 2013 measure. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what their leanings are. What you\u2019re doing in effect is saying we don\u2019t care about what you think, we\u2019re going to do this anyway.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "John Walker, an Arkansas lawmaker and civil rights attorney who represented black students in a long-running court fight over the desegregation of Little Rock area schools, has died.
