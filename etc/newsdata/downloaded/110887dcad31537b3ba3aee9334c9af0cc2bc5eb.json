[If Bayern are informed of the change] before it happens, we won't send any players to the national team anymore.\"\n\nThe German publication then asked Die Mannschaft technical director Oliver Bierhoff if he was concerned by Hoeness's comments, to which he responded: \"No. And according to FIFA rules, a club is obliged to send their players to the national team anyway.\"\n\nManuel Neuer Marc-Andre ter Stegen Germany 10152018\n\nTer Stegen has been in inspired form for Barcelona so far this season, most notably shutting Borussia Dortmund out in a tense 0-0 draw at Westfalenstadion in the Champions League last week.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Blaugrana goalkeeper is widely considered to be one of the best in the business, but he has only managed to claim 22 caps since making his Germany debut in 2012.\n\nNeuer, meanwhile, continues to enjoy Low's full confidence at international level, despite an inconsistent year at Bayern.\n\nHowever, the Germany boss has been unafraid to wield the axe with underperforming stars in the past, with the likes of Jerome Boateng, Thomas Muller and Mats Hummels having been axed and not considered for future selection.\n\nTer Stegen's next opportunity to stake his claim will come when Barca take in a trip to Getafe on Saturday, while Neuer will be back in action with Bayern for a Bundesliga showdown at Paderborn.\n\nUpdate: Hoeness released a statement via his office to Der Spiegel insisting he wouldn't have made the comments, which he gave in the aftermath of Bayern's Champions League win over Red Star Belgrade, if he had given the interview now.\n\nThe statement read: \"Immediately after the Champions League game against Belgrade, Mr Hoeness made some statements regarding the discussion about Germany's No. 1 goalkeeper which he wouldn't make again today with some time having passed. The topic is done for him and he won't make any further statements on it.\"", "description": "Uli Hoeness has threatened to stop his star names from joining up with the German national team, if his goalkeeper is displaced as the No.1", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/c4OEtxQpNGsLJK8zW9No6w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mMY3AESsYLj274gYuyfU8w--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/a912510fc55e1897591fdd612394f2b2", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
