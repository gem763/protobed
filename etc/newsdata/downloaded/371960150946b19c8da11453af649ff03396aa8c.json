(Reuters) - At first glance, Cavell Street in Livonia, Michigan, looks tranquil enough - until the subject of the Democratic-led impeachment probe of President Donald Trump comes up.\n\nA sign marks Cavell Street in Precinct 25A, where the vote was split 358/358 between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016, in Livonia, Michigan, U.S., October 9, 2019. REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nA kind of suburban trench warfare is simmering amid the small detached houses and neatly trimmed lawns where diehard Trump lovers live next to Trump haters, and both sides are dug in.\n\nTensions run so high that nobody on the street displays a political yard sign, says Josh Robinson, 35, a steelworker who voted for Trump in 2016.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of the Democrats bitching and moaning,\u201d Robinson says, noting that the impeachment probe of Trump makes him want to fight harder for the president.\n\nA few doors up, sitting on her front step, Kristine Flaton says she cannot stand Trump. \u201cI wish he\u2019d been impeached a long time ago,\u201d said the 39-year-old, who is currently unemployed.\n\nMichigan is a crucial presidential battleground. Trump carried the state by less than 11,000 votes in 2016, an unexpected victory, which along with wins in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, propelled his ascent to the White House.\n\nThe precinct that includes Cavell Street in the city of Livonia, a suburb northwest of Detroit, split its votes 358-358 for Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, according to the non-partisan data organization OpenElections.\n\nFast-forward three years, there is little sign that either side has changed its mind about Trump.\n\nIf anything, attitudes appear to have been hardened by the House of Representatives\u2019 decision to launch a formal impeachment inquiry three weeks ago after a whistleblower complaint that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden.\n\nIn interviews with nearly 50 voters in Livonia and in two other swing suburbs in Michigan, where the vote was also evenly split between Trump and Clinton in 2016, Reuters found only one person who had flipped: Charles Pettyplace, 34, from Livonia, who voted for the Republican but now regrets it.\n\nThe impeachment investigation \u201cjust adds to the turmoil around him. It\u2019s not what his office should be,\u201d Pettyplace said.\n\nRecent national polls indicate rising support in favor of the impeachment investigation, with the latest Oct. 7-8 Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showing that 45% of Americans wanted to impeach Trump, versus 39% who opposed it.\n\nBut the clean split over the issue in the Michigan suburbs suggests another close battle in the state in the November 2020 election.\n\nWhich side is more energized and turns out in greater force next year will decide the election, said Gary Jacobson, a political science professor at the University of California San Diego who has studied the partisan divides in U.S. politics.\n\n\u201cThis election will come down to turnout. In 2020, both parties are in a huge battle to mobilize the base and I think we\u2019ll see the highest turnout in 100 years. The impeachment will feed into that and further that,\u201d Jacobson said.\n\nSPLIT AND ANGRY\n\nAbout 100 miles (160 km) north of Livonia, in Saginaw Township, Michigan, two precincts were split 876-876 and 765-764 between Trump and Clinton in 2016.\n\nThree years later, voters seemed just as split, and angry.\n\nTrump supporter Ray Kirby, 48, a chef taking a stroll along quiet residential Ann Street, says he was shocked to receive a totally split response when he recently sent a Facebook post supportive of the president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that before. People either love him or hate him.\u201d\n\nRob Grose, the manager of Saginaw Township, says many people in his town \u201chave agreed to stop talking politics because of their opposing views, because they get into arguments.\u201d\n\nHank Choate, a district chair of Michigan\u2019s Republican Party and a member of its issues committee, expects the impeachment issue to cause huge voter turnout on both sides.\n\nOn one level, it helps his party to turn out more Republican votes, because Trump\u2019s supporters are so energized. Yet he also worries that the same goes for the Democrats.\n\nBut the longer the inquiry goes on, the more alienated independent voters will become, predicts Choate, 69.\n\nPolitically independent Americans are nearly evenly split over what Congress should do about Trump, even as a majority of them disapprove of the president in general, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nBut Geoff Garin, a veteran Democratic pollster, said even the voters who do not necessarily support impeachment agree that Trump is a figure of chaos. He also believes that Trump\u2019s support among Republicans is not as intense as Democratic voters\u2019 support appears to be for his eventual opponent.\n\nSlideshow (30 Images)\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people ambivalent about impeachment but nonetheless are disapproving of his conduct, which I expect is what will really matter electorally,\u201d Garin said.\n\nSipping coffee at a cafe in Saginaw Township, Carlee Giordano, 23, says she is afraid of discussing her political views in such a charged environment.\n\n\u201cPeople are either diehard blue or diehard red and it\u2019s starting to bleed into everything else,\u201d said Giordano, who wrote her college thesis on \u201cToxic Masculinity\u201d and wants to see Trump impeached. \u201cYour political views are becoming a personality trait.\u201d", "description": "At first glance, Cavell Street in Livonia, Michigan, looks tranquil enough - until the subject of the Democratic-led impeachment probe of President Donald Trump comes up.", "authors": ["Tim Reid", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441063717&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0OI", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
