What\u2019s worse is that as a 16-month-old, his goldfish memory means he\u2019s trapped in a neverending state of discovering he\u2019s ill, so that roughly every few minutes he\u2019ll give a rasping cough and remember all over again he doesn\u2019t feel great. It\u2019s sad, but it does have one practical benefit \u2013 a sudden outpouring of affection for me that\u2019s quite a welcome change of pace.\n\nI\u2019ve previously described myself as being the Andrew Ridgeley of his parents \u2013 famous, yes, but also oddly anonymous given I spend more time with him than any other adult. Oh, I get affectionate play and loads of laughter, but very little of that full-strength adoration my wife gets. When he\u2019s poorly, I get great big sympathy-generating hugs, but ordinarily I get the kind where he just collapses on to me without much in the way of emotional intent, and he can pull away at any point. It\u2019s the toddler equivalent of those two-hand handshakes politicians do.\n\nIt was easier in the past, when the only things he showered with love were inanimate; cuddles for Tud his panda and kisses for Upsy Daisy. Not to mention the cult-like devotion held for Pingie, the plastic penguin of whom we no longer speak, since his voice chip malfunctioned and his every utterance became a screech and we had to put him out with the bins.\n\nBut now he\u2019s started hugging his cousins, petting friends\u2019 dogs, even kissing his mum quite tenderly on the cheek. In fairness, these kisses involve him clamping his open mouth to her cheek like a limpet, but the tenderness is implied.\n\nI don\u2019t want to debate the relative strength of maternal or paternal bonds. For one thing, a lot of that conversation seems based on unhelpful stereotypes about \u2018innate\u2019 feminine qualities, etc. It\u2019s also a blanket invitation for certain Men\u2019s Rights types to storm my mentions with tales of dads \u2013 occasionally of the cape-clad, crane-climbing variety \u2013 so greatly beloved by their child, it\u2019s a wonder Mother\u2019s Day is even still a thing.\n\nIn our case, however, my wife is still the sun. I\u2019m more like a fondly admired cloud. My presence is like when you get on the bus and see another bus driver sitting beside the main driver. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s unhappy to see me, just slightly confused as to why I\u2019m there if she is.\n\nAll of which leaves me waiting for my son\u2019s affections to be apportioned my way, with that same hopeful, pathetic expectation that fills Gary Barlow as he checks the Queen\u2019s honours list each year. My wife sees this and, like Gary Barlow\u2019s butler flipping the paper to the sports page, reassures me it doesn\u2019t mean anything. For now, I\u2019ll bide my time. Best not to make too much noise about it, unless I want to be the next beloved object sent out with the bins.\n\nFollow S\u00e9amas on Twitter @shockproofbeats", "description": "There\u2019s one upside to the boy being ill \u2013 an outpouring of affection for me, usually second place to his mum", "authors": ["S\u00e9amas O Reilly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e8aea624c5685bf06775b46500fca2442971cf6/0_171_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9bd6bae9328b8f49de9d913125896e96", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
