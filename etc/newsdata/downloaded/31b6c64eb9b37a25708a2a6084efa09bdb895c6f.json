The illnesses have claimed 12 lives, and doctors and other health experts fear there could be more on the way.\n\nThe FDA last week launched a criminal probe into the matter. As of Sept. 26, about two-thirds of the cases were in people between the ages of 18 and 34, and another 16% were in people under 18. Roughly 72% of the cases where full patient information is available have been reported in men.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration announced it will push for a ban on all flavored e-cigarettes, including mint and menthol flavors.\n\n\"The Trump Administration is making it clear that we intend to clear the market of flavored e-cigarettes to reverse the deeply concerning epidemic of youth e-cigarette use that is impacting children, families, schools and communities,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.\n\nThe administration has separately recommended that people not use e-cigarettes.\n\n\"While the investigation is ongoing, CDC has advised that individuals consider not using e-cigarettes, because as of now, this is the primary means of preventing the severe lung disease,\" Dr. Dana Meaney-Delman of the CDC said on a press call earlier in September, reports Business Insider's Hilary Brueck.\n\nWhile it's not yet clear what exactly is causing these illnesses, it seems to affect younger people \u2014 mostly men \u2014 who are vaporizing cannabinoids like THC.\n\nThe culprit, according to some experts, might be chemicals like vitamin-E acetate that are used to emulsify THC and CBD in illegal, unregulated vaporizers. A recent study of 18 THC-containing vape cartridges commissioned by NBC News showed that 13 out of the 15 cartridges obtained from the illicit market contained vitamin-E acetate, and ten of the illicit cartridges were found to contain the pesticide myclobutanil, which can turn into hydrogen cyanide when heated. Of the three vaporizers the researchers obtained legally, none contained vitamin-E acetate.\n\n\"Even if most lung-injury cases are traced to chemicals used to emulsify THC or CBD into illegal vaping 'juices,' it doesn't let legally sold, nicotine-based e-cigs off the hook. They must do more to ensure safety of their products by engaging review process and ending youth use,\" said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former FDA commissioner.\n\nHere's what officials knew when.
