But that didn\u2019t stop the maddest dog of them all. Jim Mattis, who told everyone he hated the nickname, eventually resigned because he wasn\u2019t mad enough to follow the leader of this peculiar pack by trashing every US ally on the planet.\n\nBut that was so 2018.\n\nIf we\u2019ve learned anything at all about the wackadoodle commander-in-chief by now, we know that the brazen bozo knows no bounds. We\u2019ve also come to discover that everyone who works near him eventually starts howling like a mad dog, whether or not they were unhinged on the day they were hired.\n\nThis is not meant to impugn the good character of our crazy canine friends. But it\u2019s hard to fathom the conduct of a grown man who behaves like Donald Trump. Much like a naked drunken streaker at a Stoke City game, his pleasure at flaunting his crime is in inverse proportion to our respect for his genius, courage and good looks.\n\nPerhaps we\u2019ve been overthinking this. Perhaps, instead of gaslighting us all with some grand deception, Trump has been gaslighting himself into thinking he was kind of good at this media thing he calls the presidency.\n\nEither way, the big dog managed to drop a huge one on his impeachment defense on Thursday.\n\nSure, sure, the whistleblower report was hearsay. Sure, sure, the House Democrats were fabricating everything. Sure, sure, there was no attempt to get Ukraine to interfere with an American election. It was all so perfect. Just like the call between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nUntil Trump opened his big mouth. What exactly did he want Zelensky to do after their call, asked one cunning reporter on the White House south lawn on Thursday?\n\n\u201cWell, I would think that, if they were honest about it, they\u2019d start a major investigation into the Bidens. It\u2019s a very simple answer,\u201d said the very simple president.\n\n\u201cThey should investigate the Bidens, because how does a company that\u2019s newly formed \u2013 and all these companies, if you look at. And by the way likewise China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with, with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAdmitting to your crimes in front of the TV cameras is a novel way to start your defense. Extending those crimes to yet another country \u2013 this time, China \u2013 is certainly original. Seeking that help from a country you\u2019ve dragged into an epic trade war is venturing into creative territory.\n\n(And yes, dear MAGA readers, it\u2019s a crime.)\n\nDid it ever cross our mad dog\u2019s mind that maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a great idea to smear the Bidens with the very same stuff that his own family produces every day of the week? Probably not. In Nixon\u2019s day they used to call this \u201cdirty tricks.\u201d In Trump\u2019s hands, it\u2019s more like a dirty protest.\n\nSo we have the exquisite sight and sound of the saintly Mike Pence righteously condemning any family member trying to make a quick buck from someone close to the presidency.\n\n\u201cI think the American people have a right to know if the Vice President of the United States or his family profited from this position as Vice President during the last administration,\u201d he incanted at the First Baptist Church in Scottsdale, Arizona, on Thursday.\n\nMr Vice President, it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to the Trump family. There may not be enough baptismal water to wash this one down.\n\nHow many souls will we lose to this cult of the mad dog?\n\nThere\u2019s poor Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, trying and failing to defend Trump by wrongly disputing a word in a pseudo-transcript that he clearly never read.\n\nThere\u2019s a cluster of Trump diplomats texting each other about Trump\u2019s unlikely Ukraine adventure: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d wrote Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Kiev. Crazy for normal people, but totally normal for a mad dog.\n\nThere\u2019s a bunch of unnamed Trumpoodles pressuring the IRS to mess with the annual audit of Trump\u2019s tax returns, as yet another whistleblower has reported.\n\nAnd there\u2019s Mike Pompeo, who thinks it\u2019s normal to go on national TV and pretend like he knew nothing about the Ukraine call. Ten days later, the secretary of state admitted he took part in the very same call, but declared Congress should back off.\n\nTen days before that, pundits thought Pompeo could run for senate or even president.\n\nFor heaven\u2019s sake, gentlemen! You\u2019re sacrificing your reputations for a man who tweets the Nickleback meme, whose campaign mimics A-ha, and who can\u2019t stop trashing Greta Thunberg. Were there no other mad dogs you could find in a dark DC alley?\n\nCrazy things happen when crazy takes over the West Wing. Pretty soon, you end up with Fox News \u2013 Fox News! \u2013 firing a wingnut like Todd Starnes for saying that Democrats worship a pagan god who likes child sacrifice.\n\nThe impeachment saga that is only just starting will revolve around whether Donald Trump is unfit to hold the office of the president. But we already know the answer to that. The real question is whether Trump is fit to hold a pack of Tide pods.\n\nA former police detective in Washington liked to tell the story of the dumbest criminal he ever met. This particular felon plotted an elaborate stick-up at a Home Depot, where he pretended to be interested in applying for a job. He duly filled out a job application form before pulling out his gun to demand all their cash. A few hours after the robbery, the police rolled up to his home to arrest him: he wrote his real address on the job form.\n\nDonald Trump behaves like he\u2019s pulling off the heist of the century. For all we know about his personal finances, he might just be. But thanks to multiple whistleblowers, and the words that tumble endlessly out of his mouth, we now have something else: the trail of evidence that leads right to the Oval Office.", "description": "Speaking on TV, the US president said that Ukraine should investigate Joe Biden.
