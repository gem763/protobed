One of the National Basketball Association\u2019s media partners, Tencent, and Chinese state broadcaster CCTV have issued statements that they will not be broadcasting the Texas franchise\u2019s games. The Chinese sports apparel brand Li Ning has also sought to distance itself from what it has called \u201cupsetting comments\u201d.\n\nOn Monday, CCTV weighed in during a live news broadcast by asserting that \u201c[Morey\u2019s] support for Hong Kong\u2019s thugs offends all Chinese people, who take a zero-toleration stance on any challenge against national sovereignty. Double-faced Daryl Morey must apologise\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Beijing Olympics a decade on Show all 9 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

Houston owner Tilman Fertitta was at pains to emphasise that Morey had not spoken on behalf of the franchise.\n\nIn turn, the National Basketball Association (NBA) issued a press release in which it acknowledged that Morey\u2019s words had \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China\u201d. The NBA went on to say \u201cwe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together\u201d.\n\nBehind the NBA\u2019s rather lame \u201csport for good\u201d manifesto, which the association\u2019s PR team clearly felt was the right positioning for a clarifying statement, there lies a stark reality: over the last two decades, the NBA has spent millions of dollars and countless hours in its quest to become the West\u2019s preeminent sports franchise in China.\n\nA contrite (though probably forced) Morey eventually took to Twitter again, posting a cowed message: \u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\u201d\n\nFine words indeed, mirroring those of some Chinese business leaders who have previously found themselves temporarily detained by the state for the purposes of corrective education. There is a growing sense in this matter that one is either with China or against China.\n\nThis has been suitably embodied in comments made by Joseph Tsai, the co-founder and executive vice-chairman of China\u2019s Alibaba, but also owner of the NBA\u2019s Brooklyn Nets franchise. Whilst Tsai has stopped short of directly attacking Morey, his proclamations about the matter have been striking.\n\nIn a public statement, Tsai stressed that \"Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all Chinese citizens \u2026 when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country\u2019s sovereignty over her homeland [the] issue is non-negotiable.\"\n\nTsai\u2019s wording was provocative, not least amongst those who do not view the Hong Kong protesters as separatists but as people simply exercising their democratic rights and concerns for the future. It will be interesting to see how America\u2019s basketball courts respond to Tsai and to his franchise\u2019s association with what many in the US will see as an increasingly authoritarian Chinese regime.\n\nThe whole episode induces some tired clich\u00e9s in one\u2019s mind; for example, \u201csport and politics don\u2019t mix\u201d and \u201csport shouldn\u2019t be about business\u201d. Yet this incident is the car crash that was inevitably going to happen. When financially avaricious western sports franchises choose to do business in undemocratic countries like China, the potential for damaging clashes is always there.\n\nYet American basketball is not the only sport playing the game, as the endless flow of European football clubs into China demonstrates. What these organisations need to keep in mind is that while their commercial strategies and revenue generating tactics may not seem untoward, the unfortunate reality is that they are both an implied political judgement and an exercise in ceding power to government in Beijing.", "description": "After months of turmoil in Hong Kong, mounting violence in the territory set against the backdrop of an increasingly bellicose China recently prompted the Houston Rockets basketball franchise\u2019s general manager, Daryl Morey, to tweet: \u201cFight for Freedom.
