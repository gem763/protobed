Wagner Cultivation Corporation (\u201cJWC\u201d or the \u201cCorporation\u201d) (TSX VENTURE: JWCA; OTCQX: JWCAF), is pleased to announce that its wholly-owned subsidiary, James E. Wagner Cultivation Ltd., has entered into a mutually collaborative product trial and evaluation agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with Fluence Bioengineering, Inc. (\u201cFluence\u201d) to test and provide feedback regarding the performance, functionality and suitability of Fluence\u2019s VYPR 2p Broad Spectrum LED lighting solution. Analysis will be conducted under the Agreement for a term of eight months to assess whether JWC can further improve its high level of energy efficiency by using lighting equipment provided by Fluence to help optimize cultivation performance at its flagship JWC2 facility located at 530 Manitou Drive, Kitchener, Ontario.\n\n\n\nThroughout the term of the Agreement, Fluence will visit JWC to provide assistance with data collection, training on best practices for cultivating with LED lighting solutions and recommendations for climatic parameters to promote optimal plant growth. In turn, JWC will provide data analysis to Fluence with respect to cultivation performance in the flowering rooms utilizing Fluence\u2019s lighting solutions.\n\n\u201cAs a cultivator focused on optimizing plant metrics and yields, we are always looking at ways to enhance cultivation performance,\u201d said Nathan Woodworth, President and CEO of JWC. \u201cWe expect Fluence\u2019s LED solutions to provide a material cost and performance benefit for JWC. If the endpoint is met, it will reduce production costs and help augment yield per plant, which is already among the highest in the industry. We look forward to analyzing the results once the grow cycle data becomes available.\u201d\n\nIf the project is successfully completed in accordance with the criteria set out in the Agreement, JWC intends to extend the relationship with Fluence by purchasing certain equipment from Fluence.\n\n\u201cAt Fluence, we are dedicated to providing cultivators with the most innovative and efficient technology for growing high-quality cannabis,\u201d said David Cohen, CEO of Fluence. \u201cOur collaboration with JWC reinforces our commitment to exploring the interaction between light and life with industry-leading research and best practices for building advanced cultivation facilities.\u201d\n\nCriteria to be analyzed include a defined cost benefit relative to each growing cycle and enhanced cultivation performance as defined in the Agreement.\n\nAbout Fluence by OSRAM\n\nFluence Bioengineering, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of OSRAM, creates the most powerful and energy-efficient LED lighting solutions for commercial crop production and research applications.
