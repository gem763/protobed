That comprised 265 engineering employees and 170 members of its product team. That compares with about 400 members of the marketing team who were abruptly laid off in July amid similar concerns.\n\n\u201cOur hope with these changes is to reset and improve how we work day-to-day \u2014 ruthlessly prioritizing, and always holding ourselves accountable to a high bar of performance and agility,\u201d the company said in its statement. \u201cWhile certainly painful in the moment, especially for those directly affected, we believe that this will result in a much stronger technical organization.\"\n\n[Internal data shows Uber\u2019s reputation hasn\u2019t changed much since #DeleteUber]\n\nThe statement, first reported by TechCrunch, was confirmed by an Uber spokesman. Uber has a total of about 27,000 employees worldwide.\n\nThe Washington Post recently reported that despite a half-billion-dollar marketing campaign last year, Uber\u2019s internal metrics, based on a mixture of internal tracking and external polling, have recently placed brand sentiment near the same lows measured in the depths of the #DeleteUber movement in 2017. Uber\u2019s brand dilemma has also complicated its already rocky start as a public company.\n\n[Uber rang in its IPO with champagne and mimosas. Then the hangover began.]\n\nThe company lost $5.2 billion in its most recent quarter, prompting stock prices to dip further. The need to ease investor concerns has triggered belt-tightening, including the marketing layoffs. The changes prompted some employees to suspect more cuts could be coming, workers told The Post.\n\nUber said in the statement the changes were made after Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi asked executives to examine their teams through the lens of how they might look if they were building them from scratch.\n\n\u201cPreviously, to meet the demands of a hypergrowth start-up, we hired rapidly and in a decentralized way,\u201d Uber said in the statement.", "description": "The company said the changes amounted to roughly 8 percent of the product and engineering staffs.", "authors": ["Faiz Siddiqui", "San Francisco-Based Tech Reporter Covering Automation", "The Future Of Transportation", "Including Tesla", "Uber", "September At Pm", "Faiz Siddiqui Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Technology Team.
