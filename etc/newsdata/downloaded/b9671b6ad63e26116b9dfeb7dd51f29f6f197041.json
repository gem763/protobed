It also has a five-storey period property and three cottages.\n\nPotential buyers have been invited to express an interest in all \u2013 or part \u2013 of the site.\n\nVirgin Active, which is part-owned by wealthy South African businessman Christo Wiese, said it could use the site to create a leisure complex similar to one it owns in nearby Chiswick.\n\nThe Bank originally purchased the site in 1908 to build a sports centre and record office.\n\nIts clubhouse was used by the Royal Naval Air Service \u2013 the air arm of the Royal Navy \u2013 during the First World War. The grounds were turned into allotments during the Second World War and the clubhouse was destroyed by bombing.\n\nThese days the club hosts Wimbledon's qualifying tournament.
