A group of lawmakers recently visited the World Health Organization in Geneva to better understand their health impact, he said.\n\nThe Philippines levied an excise tax on vapes and heat-not-burn tobacco for the first time in July, then quickly followed it up with a proposal to further raise their rates to match those of traditional cigarettes. The bill, which is backed by President Rodrigo Duterte and his economic team, aims to deter first-time use especially among younger Filipinos. No vaping-related deaths have been reported in the Philippines so far.\n\nThe U.S. Congress this week moved forward with legislation that would prohibit e-cigarette use by underage people, after 1,299 cases of vaping-related lung injuries and 26 deaths. More than two dozen countries -- including Australia and Singapore -- have cut off access completely to e-cigarettes.", "description": "Philippines Unlikely to Ban E-Cigarettes But Higher Tax Planned", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picc2595ec6c92c56f9bf9d73e3c2f8529f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
