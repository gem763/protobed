In support of those argument, the pseudo-textualists falsely claim that the Department of Justice and other defenders of the longstanding understanding of Title VII are resting their position on the unenacted intentions of members of Congress in 1964 rather than on the original public meaning of Title VII. In particular, they repeatedly invoke, as though it helps them, the statement in Justice Scalia\u2019s unanimous opinion in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services (1998) that \u201cit is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\u201d\n\nBut DOJ and its allies embrace this passage from Oncale. Far from relying on the \u201cprincipal concerns\u201d of members of Congress in 1964, they explicitly argue that the \u201cordinary public meaning of \u2018sex\u2019 in 1964 is dispositive.\u201d (DOJ Brief at 19.) What\u2019s more, they show that Oncale\u2019s reading of Title VII fully supports their position. In a passage that the pseudo-textualists prefer to ignore, Justice Scalia\u2019s unanimous opinion in Oncale quoted with approval this statement from an earlier concurring opinion by Justice Ginsburg:\n\n\u201cThe critical issue, Title VII\u2019s text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.\u201d\n\nDiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity does not expose \u201cmembers of one sex \u2026 to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.\u201d Oncale\u2019s reading of Title VII thus defeats the brief\u2019s claim.\n\nI\u2019m sorry to see that today\u2019s Washington Post article on the Title VII cases falls hook, line, and sinker for the pseudo-textualist misframing:\n\nNo one argues that Congress in 1964 intended to protect LGBTQ individuals; homosexual conduct was illegal in the vast majority of the country. The solicitor general said that basic fact should decide the cases. \u201cIn 1964, the ordinary public meaning of \u2018sex\u2019 was biological sex,\u201d [solicitor general Noel] Francisco wrote. Congress is free to make clear that Title VII includes sexual orientation and transgender status, Francisco said, but it has repeatedly turned down attempts to change the law to do so. The plaintiffs and their lawyers say that the statute\u2019s text, not what Congress intended, should hold. That is something of a switch \u2014 usually it is conservatives making such a textualist argument \u2014 and the lawyers point to an unlikely ally: the late justice Antonin Scalia. In a 1998 ruling in a case called Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Scalia wrote for the court that male-on-male sexual harassment was covered by Title VII even though it is not mentioned in the statute or envisioned by Congress. \u201cIt is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed,\u201d Scalia wrote, adding that same-sex harassment need not be \u201cthe principal evil Congress was concerned with.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re the textualists here,\u201d said Ria Tabacco Mar, an attorney for the ACLU, which is representing the Zarda estate. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones pointing to the words of the statute.\u201d\n\nNote that in the first passages I\u2019ve italicized the article accurately quotes DOJ\u2019s brief as making an argument based on \u201cordinary public meaning\u201d but somehow mischaracterizes that argument as resting on what \u201cCongress in 1964 intended\u201d but didn\u2019t express in text. Remarkable. (By the way, I don\u2019t mean to single out the Post for criticism. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if this media misframing is widespread; I simply ran across it in the Post.)", "description": "I\u2019m sorry to see that today\u2019s Washington Post article on the Title VII cases falls hook, line, and sinker for the pseudo-textualist misframing.", "authors": ["Ed Whelan", "Andrew C.
