The software upgrade had stopped CBA from transferring big payment data files to move funds between banks.\n\nInconvenience for customers and others was varied and widespread.\n\nWhen people can\u2019t make or receive payments, it has an effect on spending in the real economy. And it's not small thing when 7 million customers are affected.\n\nCBA systems were down until 6am on Friday morning, and a backlog of payments meant some were still being cleared during the weekend.\n\nThe glitch should bring additional regulatory scrutiny from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Reserve Bank, given their growing concerns about the potential risk posed by the lack of IT systems resilience.\n\nQuestions are being asked about why a critical upgrade was taking place on a Thursday, a big day for running payrolls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe outage will also raise questions about the risks of moving from monolithic IT systems to modern, \"modularised\" technology architecture.\n\nThe flexibility is supposed to make it easier to deal with problems when they arise. But theory didn't translate into reality at CBA last week.\n\nThe interconnected nature of tech in the financial system, means one bank\u2019s troubles can mean problems for all.\n\nThe saga will be studied not only by IT experts but also in PR circles. After APRA's prudential inquiry into CBA and the royal commission, the bank pledged to become more transparent.\n\nYet, although it apologised for last week's outage, a detailed explanation wasn't forthcoming.\n\nDespite CBA chief executive Matt Comyn being out and about lately touting the bank's tech capabilities, it was left to head of group public affairs Danny John to front the public on Friday on 3AW.\n\nThe head-in-the-sand approach contrasts with that of National Australia Bank when its systems went down - on a Saturday morning - in May last year.\n\nWithin two hours, its head of business banking was offering an explanation on a video posted on NAB's website; one of its general managers did a doorstop media interview in the afternoon; and its then CEO, Andrew Thorburn, went on 3AW the next morning to explain - and announce a compensation scheme for customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA systemic lesson from all this is that the interconnected nature of tech in the financial system means one bank\u2019s troubles can mean problems for all.\n\nAll the other big banks had incident teams working on Friday, as their own payments were delayed. All of them are also aware that they are hardly immune to the kind of problem that hit CBA.\n\nA second lesson relates to the risks of running complex, connecting systems.\n\nBanks are connecting legacy systems into many modern interfaces, including the NPP, while shifting to microservices, cloud computing and more modular systems.\n\nThere is also growing collaboration with fintechs, so reliance on contractors and third-party vendors is increasing.\n\nBanks must take responsibility for problems when using outsiders' services, as CBA did. They also need understand that collaboration increases vulnerabilities, and the effects can be widespread.", "description": "The negative power of tech was on display at the end of last week when a seemingly innocuous bank software update problem rippled across the Australian economy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3511%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_37%2C$y_319/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b1371aade1e27d1bf7ca40a5d1dad133fc63f0b2", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
