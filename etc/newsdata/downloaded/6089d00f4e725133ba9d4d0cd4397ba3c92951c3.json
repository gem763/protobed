REUTERS/Eva Plevier/File Photo\n\nThe Dutch firm\u2019s shares have surged 75% this year, shrugging off weak end-markets for semiconductor producers as ASML\u2019s cutting-edge equipment remains in demand from computer chip heavyweights like Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor.\n\nThird-quarter net profit came in at 627 million euros ($692 million), beating analysts\u2019 average forecast of 609 million according to a Reuters poll, though the outcome was down on the 680 million made in the same period last year.\n\nASML shares dipped 1.0 percent to 240 euros in early trading, after closing on Tuesday at an all-time high of 243.2 euros. The stock\u2019s rapid rise has seen the company\u2019s equity market value top 100 billion euros.\n\nThird-quarter sales of 3 billion euros met analysts\u2019 estimates, driven by demand for 5G telecom network and artificial intelligence applications, and the company forecast fourth-quarter sales of 3.8 billion euros.\n\nASML said it had received bookings for 23 of its most advanced lithography systems, which cost around 100 million euros each. Lithography is at the heart of the chipmaking process, using beams of light to map out the circuitry of chips.\n\nASML is a near-monopolist in the category and said its newest technology using Extreme Ultraviolet, or EUV, beams, was going mainstream.\n\n\u201cThis strong order inflow confirms the adoption of EUV in high volume manufacturing for Logic and Memory\u201d chips, said Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see 2019 as a growth year.\u201d\n\nFor all products, net bookings amounted to 5.1 billion euros in the quarter, compared to just 2.8 billion in the March 31-June 30 2019 period.\n\n\u201cAll in all a reasonable quarter but the extra strength in this update is in the very strong bookings number\u201d said ING analysts in a note, maintaining a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock.\n\n\u201cLooking beyond 2019, ASML sees a very healthy market for logic. Memory market recovery is still uncertain.\u201d\n\nForecaster IHS Markit predicts the global semiconductor market will rebound 5% in 2020 to $449 billion after a 13% decline this year.", "description": "Semiconductor equipment maker ASML beat quarterly profit and bookings forecasts on Wednesday, continuing a strong run of results on demand for its latest chipmaking equipment.", "authors": ["Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441372824&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0BN", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
