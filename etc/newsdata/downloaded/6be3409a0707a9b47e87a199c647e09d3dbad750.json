It was quite a response to that slightly embarrassing start.\n\nThis England team, however, don\u2019t look like one as susceptible to embarrassment as so many of their predecessors. They\u2019ve already altered so many realities around the side.\n\nAnother altered reality is that, after all the discussion over whether he is undroppable, Harry Kane no longer feels England\u2019s most important player. And that was long before he missed that penalty, despite all the practice.\n\nIt\u2019s because Sterling is really just so good, so complete, so dominant.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

His exhilarating surges were a metaphor for England\u2019s performance in this campaign as a whole, just powering through group opposition, no one able to stop them.\n\nOne of them was also the centre of what might be the idealised England goal, which here made it 4-1. It was the perfect combination of individual brilliance, understanding and collective co-ordination.\n\nAs Sterling again surged through the Kosovan half \u2013 just as he\u2019d done minutes earlier for Kane\u2019s supreme strike \u2013 the captain again peeled off to the left, Sancho to the right.\n\nArijanet Muric\u2019s defence didn\u2019t know where to go, meaning Sterling knew precisely where to put it. He played in Sancho, who then just changed it up in such dazzlingly disorientating fashion. Sheer pace was followed by measured precision, as Sancho so calmly slipped it in.\n\nThis was another element of England\u2019s attacking: the tactical variety to it. It was just as symbolic that Sterling\u2019s first came from that most rudimentary of goals, a set-piece header. Michael Keane made up for his opening error by winning a corner in the box, allowing the Manchester City forward to nod in.\n\nEngland were away, as was Sterling. His turn-and-run for Kane\u2019s strike was almost Paul Gascoigne-like, his little chip for Sancho\u2019s second reminiscent of Mesut Ozil.\n\nThe greater point to all of this, though, is that Sterling has now developed as a player he is very much a commanding star in his own right \u2013 with no wider comparisons necessary.\n\nThe same might soon be said of Sancho, who showed the difference he makes to this England team with the jinking run that bamboozled Mergim Vojvoda into an own goal. That isn\u2019t just a quality Southgate\u2019s side have been lacking, but one the modern game has been lacking.\n\nThe opening 35 seconds did foreshadow the reality this wasn\u2019t a totally flawless performance from England. You could even say it was a performance of two halves beyond the scoring: exceptional attacking, questionable defending. There were more errors in it than just Keane\u2019s misplaced pass that set up Valon Berisha\u2019s opening goal, which maybe reflects the huge margin for error in this group at the moment.\n\nBerisha was given a huge amount of space just after half-time to make it 5-2, and Harry Maguire was at his clumsiest in \u201cjustifying a fall\u201d from Vedat Muriqi for the same player to score a penalty.\n\nThere was then Kane having a penalty saved. So much for those 50 shots in practice.\n\nIt didn\u2019t really matter, though. Sterling had by then done most of the damage.
