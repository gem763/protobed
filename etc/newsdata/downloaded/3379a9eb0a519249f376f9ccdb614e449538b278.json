REUTERS/Dinuka Liyanawatte/File Photo\n\nRelations between the important trading partners have deteriorated in recent years amid accusations that China is meddling in Australian domestic affairs and Australian fears that China is seeking undue influence in the Pacific region.\n\nAustralian lawmakers had sought to improve the relationship by refraining from public criticism of China but Peter Dutton, the minister for home affairs, said Australia would not be silent despite their commercial relations.\n\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade worth more than A$180 billion ($122 billion) last year.\n\n\u201cWe have a very important trading relationship with China \u2013 incredibly important,\u201d Dutton told reporters in Canberra.\n\n\u201cBut we are not going to allow university students to be unduly influenced, we are not going to allow theft of intellectual property, and we are not going to allow our government bodies or non-government bodies to be hacked into,\u201d he said.\n\nChina\u2019s embassy in Canberra called the remarks \u201cirrational ... shocking and baseless\u201d in a statement on its website, adding that they constituted \u201can outright provocation to the Chinese people\u201d.\n\n\u201cSuch ridiculous rhetoric severely harms the mutual trust between China and Australia and betrays the common interests of the two peoples,\u201d the embassy said.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged calm on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI would warn against any sort of over-analysis or over-reaction to those comments because they just simply reflect that we\u2019re two different countries,\u201d Morrison told reporters in Fiji in televised remarks.\n\nAustralia and China have much in common, Morrison added.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I think our relationship with China will always remain positive, because it\u2019s focussed on the things we agree on and that benefit each country, not on the areas that I think there are clear differences. And of course there are clear differences,\u201d he said.\n\nChina has previously denied any improper activities, accusing Australia of adopting a \u201cCold War mentality\u201d.\n\nReuters reported this month that Australian intelligence had determined China was responsible for a cyberattack on the national parliament and three largest political parties before a general election in May, according to five people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry denied involvement in any hacking attacks and said the internet was full of theories that were hard to trace.\n\nHackers were also targeting its most prestigious university, an official report by the Australian National University (ANU) showed, which stoked fears that China could influence research and students.\n\nThe ANU said last week its investigators were unable to identify who was responsible for the cyberattack.\n\nForeign students are worth about A$35 billion a year to the Australian economy, with Chinese students accounting for about a third of that figure.\n\nAustralian universities are financially dependent on overseas students, raising fears that foreign governments could exert undue influence.\n\nAs a result, Australian universities will now be required to work with security agencies to ensure they guard against undue foreign interference.", "description": "A senior Australian government minister said on Friday China was behaving in a way that was inconsistent with Australian values by targeting political parties and universities in Australia, drawing a sharp rebuke from China's embassy.", "authors": ["Colin Packham", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1439897393&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0GD", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
