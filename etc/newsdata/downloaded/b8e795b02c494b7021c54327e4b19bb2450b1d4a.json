But now one of McCabe\u2019s attorneys is wondering where the indictment is \u2014 and says he thinks the grand jury hearing the case decided not to indict.\n\nA federal grand jury met this week concerning the case, according to sources, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. But days of deliberations haven\u2019t yet resulted in charges, indicating that federal prosecutors might not have gotten what they wanted. The grand jury was released Thursday with no indications of an indictment, The Washington Post reported.\n\nMcCabe attorney Michael Bromwich pressed the U.S. attorney in Washington in an email to confirm McCabe\u2019s status.\n\nBromwich said that, based on earlier conversations with other prosecutors, \u201cit is clear that no indictment has been returned,\u201d Bromwich wrote in the email, which was posted on Twitter.\n\n\u201cIf the grand jury voted not to approve charges, it did not find probable cause. Therefore, it is simply not reasonable to believe that a trial jury would find Mr. McCabe guilty of any charges employing a far more rigorous and exacting standard \u2014 beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Bromwich wrote.\n\nHe also noted: \u201cIndeed, we believe that if the grand jury has in fact voted a no true bill, the Justice Manual compels you not to resubmit the case to the same or a different grand jury.\u201d\n\nJust in: Andrew McCabe\u2019s legal team says in a new letter to Jesse Liu that based on their conversations with the US Attorney\u2019s office in DC yesterday, \u201cit is clear that no indictment has been returned\u201d against McCabe by the grand jury. pic.twitter.com/XtMTelYqEv \u2014 Natasha Bertrand (@NatashaBertrand) September 13, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s rare for a grand jury not to deliver what a prosecutor wants because it only hears a prosecutor\u2019s version of events.\n\nMcCabe has been a frequent target of President Donald Trump because of his role in investigating the possible collusion between the Kremlin and Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nMcCabe had been under federal criminal investigation since the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general concluded that he misled investigators about providing information in 2016 to a Wall Street Journal reporter, which McCabe has denied.", "description": "An attorney for the former FBI deputy director presses federal prosecutors about an anticipated indictment that hasn't materialized.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7c6c09240000d32679dff1.jpeg?cache=u3rouon0vp&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
