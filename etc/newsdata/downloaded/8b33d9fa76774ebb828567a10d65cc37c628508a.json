How to Trade the Three Possible Brexit Outcomes", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow @Brexit, sign up to our Brexit Bulletin, and tell us your Brexit story.\n\nThe pound, U.K. stocks and British government bond yields would all likely plunge should the country leave the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31.\n\nSterling would drop to $1.11 from a current level of around $1.23, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 18 foreign-exchange strategists and investors, while a rush toward the safety of government debt could drive bond yields to record lows. Bloomberg Intelligence forecasts a 13% slide in the fair value of the FTSE 100 index over 12 months in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cIf we know beforehand, then the pound will be selling off in advance and Oct. 31 may not be that big a deal,\u201d Kenneth Broux, a strategist at Societe Generale SA, said in written comments. \u201cIf this goes down to the wire on the 30th because of a legal procedure and markets are kept waiting, the one-day or one-week shock will be greater.\u201d\n\nMarket participants still don\u2019t see much chance of a no-deal outcome, taking the view that either Parliament or the courts will step in to block Prime Minister Boris Johnson from his vow of delivering Brexit \u201cdo or die.\u201d Yet with less than a month until the deadline, the market is left with the possibility of three drastically differing outcomes -- deal, no deal or extension. Here\u2019s a summary of what investors and analysts are saying about them:\n\nNo Deal\n\nShould the U.K. leave the EU without a deal, the inverse relationship between the pound and the FTSE 100 index is likely to break down, according to Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management. International stocks are seen slumping along with domestically-focused companies and sterling, while the immediate outlook for gilts is unclear.\n\nDespite its international make-up, the FTSE 100 is still the index most exposed to the U.K. among the key benchmarks tracked by foreign investors, Greetham said in a telephone interview.\u201cSo if you\u2019re trying to reduce your U.K. exposure as a foreign investor, you would be selling the FTSE at the same time as pulling money out of the pound.\u201dA Morgan Stanley simulation forecasts 3%-5% short-term downside for U.K. blue chips in a no-deal divorce.The heightened political uncertainty would probably outweigh the positive impact of a weaker currency that enhances the value of overseas earnings.The domestic-focused FTSE 250 would drop the most though, taking an 8%-12% hit, economists and strategists including Daniele Antonucci wrote on Sept. 30.\u201cA headline like a no-deal Brexit probably does mean that in those first couple of days, there\u2019s a risk-off sentiment globally,\u201d Andrew Millington, head of U.K. equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said by phone.Even so, with unchanged fundamentals and a central bank that\u2019s likely to be supportive of the economy, stocks would recover over the longer term.The \u201cknee-jerk\u201d reaction in the pound to a no-deal would probably see it drop to $1.10-$1.15, said Stephen Gallo, head of European currency strategy at BMO Capital Markets.According to Jane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank, such an outcome isn\u2019t priced in to the pound.\u201cIf we do have a hard Brexit we will see a very strong initial tumble in sterling. Among sterling-based investors, there would be a movement towards gilts and away from equities.\u201d\n\nDeal\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the less-international FTSE 250 index will benefit more than the FTSE 100 if a deal is done, as its members are more exposed to the health of the U.K. economy. The pound would likely make good some of the 6% drop seen against the dollar since the original Brexit deadline of March 29.\n\nEach percentage point upside move in sterling will translate into a percentage point of outperformance for U.K. domestic stocks versus internationals, Goldman Sachs analysts including Sharon Bell wrote in a Sept. 27 note.That suggests a possible 5% gain for domestic shares if a deal is reached, as the pound heads toward $1.30.Aberdeen Standard Investments also envisages gains for the FTSE 250, noting that a number of sectors are pricing in a hard Brexit.Some bank stocks, for example, are trading below book value, while home-builders too are at depressed valuations, despite the country\u2019s housing shortage.ING Groep NV sees a relief rally in sterling to around $1.34 (a 9% gain), according to strategist Petr Krpata. \u201cAfter a while the focus would turn to the challenges the U.K. would be facing in negotiating the trade deals.\u201dAccording to Commerzbank AG currency strategist Thu Lan Nguyen, the pound\u2019s recovery potential in the case of a deal would be limited to 5-10% due to the fact that the U.K. economy is already weak, and weighed down by soft global growth.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow\u00a0@Brexit,\u00a0sign up\u00a0to our Brexit Bulletin, and\u00a0tell us your Brexit story.\u00a0The pound, U.K. stocks and British government bond yields would all likely plunge should the country leave the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31.Sterling would drop to $1.11 from a current level of around", "authors": ["Joe Easton", "Charlotte Ryan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cXJ8uvOQ2WpA4vQ3K6nB3Q--~B/aD03ODY7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/7618ac65ff98cb51a829fcddb49a73d1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
