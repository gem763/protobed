Earlier this week, it had said it had not contributed to or benefited from the scheme.\n\n\"Between 2016 and 2018, local teams based at Kings Cross worked with our partners to share images of a small number of convicted offenders, who routinely offended or committed anti-social behaviour (ASB) in the area,\" said a spokesman for the BTP.\n\n\"This was legitimate action in order to prevent crime and keep people safe. Understandably, the public are interested in police use of such technologies, which is why we are correcting our position.\"\n\nPublic debate\n\nThe King's Cross development covers a 67-acre (0.3-sq-km) area containing shops, offices and leisure activities. It is privately owned but much of the area is open to the public.\n\nThe BBC has again asked the developer Argent whether there were any notices on show to tell the public and workers that it was making use of facial recognition tech. But a spokeswoman declined to add anything to the statement it had already issued earlier this week.\n\nIt said that two facial recognition cameras had been operational until March 2018, but work to introduce a replacement system had been stopped.\n\nThe firm's use of the tech is already under investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office.\n\nArgent has not publicly disclosed what software it was using to power its system.\n\nResearchers have raised concerns that some systems are vulnerable to bias as they are more likely to misidentify women than men, and darker-skinned people than others. Earlier this week, the Met's most senior officer, Cressida Dick, drew attention to the problem.\n\nThe latest development comes the same day that the High Court ruled that separate tests of automated facial recognition (AFR) technology by South Wales Police were lawful. The trials had been challenged by a man who had claimed his human rights had been breached when he was photographed while shopping.\n\nOne critic of facial recognition technology said that there was now a need for a parliamentary inquiry.\n\n\"We need to debate whether we want [automated facial recognition] and if we do, under what conditions and with what safeguards,\" commented researcher Stephanie Hare.\n\n\"The British public has not been given the opportunity to express its views on something that is so inaccurate, so invasive, and so threatens their privacy and civil liberties.\n\n\"It is out of control at present and what we have learned today is that the London Met has, at a minimum, not been able to provide correct information.\"", "description": "Police force had previously denied involvement in facial recognition scans at King\u2019s Cross.", "authors": ["Leo Kelion", "Technology Desk Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/164F5/production/_108618319_whatsubject.jpg"}
