In 1972, officers were called to a blaze and found the body of 26-year-old Maxwell Confait, a male prostitute known as Michelle, who had been strangled.\n\nPolice later picked up three youths \u2013 Colin Lattimore, 18, Ronnie Leighton, 15, and Ahmed Salih, 14 \u2013 on suspicion of lighting a series of small fires nearby and pinned the murder on them.\n\nThey were held without a lawyer, without contact with a parent or guardian, with cops questioning them for as long as they liked.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nBy 2am, after hours of endless \u00adinterrogation, these vulnerable boys signed a statement confessing to the fire in Catford, South East London, and to Maxwell\u2019s murder.\n\nColin had learning \u00addifficulties and the mental age of an eight-year-old. His family knew he was innocent.\n\n\u201cNo way was he capable of murdering anyone,\u201d brother Gary told a new BBC Two \u00addocumentary Catching Britain\u2019s Killers: The Crimes That Changed Us. \u201cHe was scared of his own shadow.\n\nNightmare\n\n\u201cColin couldn\u2019t read or write. He didn\u2019t act like an 18-year-old man, he was more like an eight-year-old. He was a boy in a man\u2019s body.\u201d\n\n(Image: BBC/Wall to Wall Media Ltd)\n\n\u201cPolice were unsupervised and a law unto themselves,\u201d says Baroness Hayter, a former magistrate.\n\nIt was the start of a nightmare for the trio. Ronnie was convicted of Maxwell\u2019s murder, while Colin was found guilty of manslaughter with diminished responsibility. All three were found guilty of arson.\n\nWhile Ahmed was sentenced to three-and-a-half years, Colin and Ronnie were handed life sentences.\n\n\u201cI remember people coming out with long faces and crying,\u201d recalled Gary. \u201cMy dad, George, said,\n\n\u2018The scales of justice? You might\n\nas well rip them off and chuck them in the Thames\u2019.\u201d Ian Alexander, on the boys\u2019 defence team, was also certain they were innocent. He said: \u201cWe felt they couldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\n\n(Image: BBC/Wall to Wall Media Ltd)\n\n\u201cIt seemed an improbable story. That three boys would creep into a house, go into a room and strangle him. There wasn\u2019t any sign of any struggle. It was very difficult to make a case against the police that a \u00adstatement was made under duress. People didn\u2019t believe police could behave badly.\n\n\u201cThere was no \u00adindependent record. It was the word of the police that was believed.\u201d\n\nForensic evidence was uncertain.\n\nNo body \u00adtemperature was taken at the time of death meaning they couldn\u2019t pinpoint the moment of murder. Initially, the pathologist said time of death was between 6.30pm and 10.30pm.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\nColin had a cast-iron alibi as he was at a local social club and seen by a number of witnesses. But the prosecution insisted one thing was certain \u2013 the confessions.\n\nIn 1974, two years after the murder, a young barrister called \u00adJonathan Caplan, sitting on the National Council of Civil \u00adLiberties, received a letter from the \u00adLattimore family pleading Colin\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cI felt there had been an injustice,\u201d said Jonathan. \u201cThe important thing was to get an independent pathologist to review the time of death.\u201d\n\nThey found the murder likely took place between 8pm and 9pm, confirming the alibis.\n\nThe case was heard in the Court of Appeal and in 1975 the \u00adconvictions were quashed and Colin, Ronnie and Ahmed were told they were cleared of all charges. \u201cEveryone was ecstatic and jubilant,\u201d told Gary. \u201cColin was in shock.\u201d\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nIt became one of the first real \u00admiscarriages of justice to be exposed.\n\nOne month after the appeal, the Henry Fisher inquiry was announced.\n\nIt found aggression was used by police towards the youngsters. One allegedly got hit with a rolled up newspaper.\n\nIt criticised the police, saying the \u00adinterviews should have been done in presence of parents.\n\nIt also concluded that interviews were oppressive and recommended there should be reform at the way suspects are treated at police stations.\n\nBut in a new blow it stated the trio were responsible for the fire and that Ronnie and Ahmed had killed Maxwell.\n\n\u201cI feel very angry because of what they did, how they fitted up my brother for something he didn\u2019t do,\u201d said Gary. \u201cI still carry that anger because it changed everybody\u2019s life. Colin came out of prison and struggled with life in general. It troubled him and ruined his life.\u201d\n\nNew evidence emerged in 1980 that finally exonerated them. An inmate was overhead discussing murder in prison. He and the accomplice blamed each other so neither could be prosecuted. But the three boys\u2019 names could be cleared.\n\nDubbed one of the most serious miscarriages of justice, it sparked a giant overhaul. The Police and Criminal Evidence Bill came in 1984, \u00adtransforming the \u00adinterrogation room and our rights. Maxwell\u2019s real killer was never convicted.\n\n\u201cA change in the law was a massive thing,\u201d Gary added. \u201cWe were very happy about the because it can\u2019t happen any more. Another family can\u2019t go through what we went through.\u201d\n\nCatching Britain\u2019s Killers: The Crimes That Changed Us is on BBC Two on Wednesday at 9pm.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Dubbed one of the most serious miscarriages of justice, the 1972 investigation into a murdered prostitute sparked a giant overhaul in police tactics", "authors": ["Janine Yaqoob", "Image", "Mirrorpix", "Bbc Wall To Wall Media Ltd", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Daily Record"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20655003.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Colin-Lattimore.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
