(sic)\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErgh, so sweet.\n\nStill, while many of us are adoring the turn, the new movie has seemingly divided opinion among fans and critics.\n\nDirector Todd recently rubbished criticism of the film\u2019s violent scenes as part of the debate, as he said: \u2018That\u2019s the surprising thing to me. I thought, isn\u2019t that a good thing, to put real-world implications on violence? Isn\u2019t it a good thing to take away the cartoon element about violence that we\u2019ve become so immune to?\n\nThe portrayal of violence in the film has sparked some controversy. Picture: DC Comics\n\n\u2018I was a little surprised when it turns into that direction, that it\u2019s irresponsible. Because, to me, it\u2019s very responsible to make it feel real and make it have weight and implications.\u2019\n\nTodd also described the criticism as a learning experience, adding he was keen for audiences to form their own opinions of the movie.\n\nSpeaking at a recent screening, he explained: \u2018There\u2019s been a lot said about this movie \u2013 a lot said by me, too. I\u2019ve learned. I\u2019m really excited that you\u2019re here and we can finally let the movie speak for itself.\u2019\n\nAvengers star Josh Brolin recent defended the violence, as he took to social media to post a lengthy statement that Joker perfectly highlights problems in today\u2019s society that are often hidden and brushed under the carpet.\n\nIt read: \u2018To appreciate \u201cJoker\u201d I believe you have to have either gone through something traumatic in your lifetime (and I believe most of us have) or understand somewhere in your psyche what true compassion is (which usually comes from having gone through something traumatic, unfortunately).\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018An example of dangerous compassion would be to, say, make a film made about the fragility of the human psyche.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And make it so raw, so brutal, so balletic that by the time you leave the theatre you not only don\u2019t want to hurt anything but you desperately want an answer and a solution to the violence and mental health issues that have spun out of control around us.\u2019\n\nJosh continued: \u2018This film makes you hurt and only in pain do we ever want to change. It\u2019s all in the irony of trauma.\n\n\u2018A fine line between the resentment of wanting to hurt society back for raping you of a decent life, for not protecting you, and accepting what feels like alien feelings with softening to those others who seem freakish in our era of judgment, and digital damnation.\u2019\n\n\u2018Like kids in Middle School,\u2019 he explained. \u2018Man, they can just be mean. For no reason.\n\n\u2018And, sometimes, those awful little clicky kids breed an evil in someone that rages much later, when everyone pretends we are all back to normal, when we all thought it had just manned up and gone away.\u2019\n\nJosh concluded his statement by saying: \u2018We have a habit of hating and ostracizing and dividing and sweeping our problems under the rug.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Joker, is simply lifting the rug and looking underneath it. Nothing more. Nothing less. It\u2019s there.\u2019\n\nJoker is in cinemas now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
