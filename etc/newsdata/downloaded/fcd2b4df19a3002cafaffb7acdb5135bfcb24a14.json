Members of the media proceeded to mock Trump and claimed he was making false statements to the American public.\n\nPERFECT STORY: MEDIA POUND TRUMP OVER 'SHARPIE-GATE' HURRICAN MAP\n\nTrump responded on Twitter and kept the issue alive by claiming he had been correct, before blaming the uproar on media bias.\n\n\"[Dorian] turned North and went up the coast, where it continues now. In the one model through Florida, the Great State of Alabama would have been hit or grazed. In the path it took, no. Read my FULL FEMA statement. What I said was accurate! All Fake News in order to demean!\" Trump tweeted on Thursday.\n\n\"Just as I said, Alabama was originally projected to be hit. The Fake News denies it!\"\n\nTRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON CLAIM DORIAN THREATENED ALABAMA, SLAMS MEDIA MOCKERY\n\nHemingway said the media had no moral high ground when it came to letting things go, and accused them of devoting hours and hours to a story that wasn't worthy of coverage in the first place.\n\n\"It was unbelievable to watch this week, so much coverage devoted to 'Sharpie-gate,'\" she said earlier in the interview. \"They say that the president can\u2019t let things go, and that\u2019s absolutely true, but the media are in no position to say that, given how they handle this.\"\n\nShe continued, \"This is such a minor point that even if you put the worst construction on it, it does not deserve seven days of coverage, 24 hours, hundreds of stories, front-page news.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCNN host Brian Stelter tweeted about the story on Sunday and claimed President Trump was purposely being untruthful when he made his remarks.\n\n\"The words we use and the frames we choose matter a lot. Here, I argue that the media's framing of Trump's Alabama errors actually let the president off easy. This wasn't 'Sharpie-gate,' it was 'lying about a hurricane-gate,'\" he wrote.\n\nCNN did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment.", "description": "Following President Trump's claim that\u00a0Alabama may be affected by Hurricane Dorian, Federalist editor Mollie Hemingway said the media's nonstop coverage of the event was uncalled for and specifically cited CNN, on \"Media Buzz\" Sunday.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
