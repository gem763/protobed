We gave different scenarios and of what [the NPA] could possibly look at in terms of prosecution but, according to them, to instigate a criminal matter or case, you really have to have solid evidence.\"\n\nNxumalo said the NPA had told family members that the matter would most probably be thrown out of court.\n\n\"Then we'll struggle even more to get it back into court. So we'd rather go the inquest route, knowing that we have our facts in hand. We couldn't argue with [the NPA] on that point.\"\n\nNPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwana on Tuesday said that a \"formal and joint inquest into all deaths related to the Esidimeni tragedy will be held in the High Court of Pretoria before a Judge\".\n\nIt is not immediately clear when the inquest will be established.\n\nREAD | NPA to establish formal inquest into Life Esidimeni deaths\n\nNxumalo said the families did not know whether justice would eventually be served.\n\n\"We can only hope. All we can do is push. Since the arbitration, we have been on the NPA's necks, pushing them to get to a point. We've been asking for a decision since the arbitration.\"\n\nAn arbitration had been established on the recommendation of the health ombudsman after the release of a damning report which detailed findings regarding the deaths of psychiatric patients when they were transferred to unsuitable NGOs in 2015.\n\n\"The [inquiry], led by retired Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke concluded its work in March 2018 and found that government officials acted in breach of the law and the Constitution when they ended the Life Esidimeni contract and moved patients to NGOs without due regard for their wellbeing and state of health,\" Mjonondwane said.\n\nIn April 2017, the NPA received 144 dockets relating to the tragedy.\n\n'A bigger can of worms'\n\nThe acting Director of Public Prosecutions in Pretoria, George Baloyi, then assembled a team of four experience advocates to work with investigators to collect more information and build a case.\n\n\"Led by a very senior advocate, they devoted most of their attention to a very protracted investigation, converting all 144 enquiry dockets into one docket, guiding investigations and monitoring progress on further documentation/statements that had to be obtained,\" Mjonondwane explained.\n\nShe added, however, that the process \"has revealed that the evidence at our disposal currently is not enough to prove causation of death nor is it enough to help us link the actions of different role players to the eventual deaths\".\n\nNxumalo said a number of questions could be answered at the inquest, such as what happened to nine patients who were still missing.\n\n\"We will look at every official and role [they played] in this whole process; the police were also involved at some point. So it's going to open a bigger can of worms than the arbitration did.\"\n\n- Compiled by Riaan Grobler.
