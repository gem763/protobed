It\u2019s cosy, that\u2019s for sure.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Spill It: How much a 32-year-old PR Manager drinks in a week\n\nMORE: Rejoice, Marks & Spencer is bringing back the Percy Pigs advent calendar\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A man has opened Bertie's Barber Shop, a barber shop so tiny, in Bristol, that it can only seat two customers at a time and has fold-up chairs.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89409665_1570789875.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
