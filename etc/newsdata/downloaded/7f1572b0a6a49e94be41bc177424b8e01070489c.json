(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nThe audience has already made up its mind about \u2018Waiting for Mueller\u2019\n\nSamuel Beckett\u2019s Waiting for Godot, a play in which two men sit around and wait for someone who never shows up, has been claimed by just about everyone: Freudians, Christians, existentialists.\n\nWho\u2019s right? I haven\u2019t a clue.\n\nBut I have lived, all of us have lived, through a similar tragicomedy (a word Beckett added to the subtitle for the English version of his play). We\u2019ve been waiting for Mueller. And waiting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor some, the waiting is the hardest part. But by historic standards, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been working at a blistering pace. Kenneth Starr\u2019s investigation into the Whitewater scandal wasn\u2019t fully closed down until 2001. It started in 1994. The average running time for special investigations is 904 days. Tuesday marked the 650th day since Mueller was appointed.\n\nMost independent counsels take a year to file their first criminal charges, if they file any at all. Mueller hit that milestone a little more than five months in, and he has racked up more than 30 other indictments or guilty pleas since then.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet, for the \u201cget Trump media\u201d (as Alan Dershowitz and others call it), it\u2019s never enough. Whenever news breaks in the probe, or when news doesn\u2019t break, for that matter, the response tends to be the same: \u201cRemember, we don\u2019t know what Mueller knows.\u201d Watch CNN or MSNBC for a few minutes and someone will say this \u2014 gleefully when the news is already bad for Trump, reassuringly when the news is disappointingly good for Trump.\n\n\u201cAlways keeping in mind that Mueller knows so much more than he has shown,\u201d former CBS newsman Dan Rather told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon. \u201cIf you think [Michael Cohen\u2019s guilty plea and Paul Manafort\u2019s conviction] was a shock to our democratic system, just stay tuned. Because the other things Mueller is working on, and sooner or later we\u2019ll find out what they are, is going to make yesterday pale by comparison.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, what if it doesn\u2019t? One of the reasons we keep hearing that \u201cMueller knows more\u201d is that he has delivered less. For all of the drama and the embarrassments, Mueller has yet to file a single charge on the core allegation that justified the launch of the probe in the first place \u2014 the allegation that Donald Trump \u201ccolluded\u201d with Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure, the gaudy remoras that attached themselves to Trump\u2019s hide have had a rough time of it. Manafort, who made a career of colluding with horrible regimes, may never have another meal not thwacked from a large spoon onto a prison tray. Roger Stone may join Cohen in the Stoney Lonesome as well. And obviously, Trump has made things worse for himself by seeming like he\u2019s got a lot to hide.\n\nBut it looks more and more likely that Mueller\u2019s dance of a thousand veils will end with . . . more veils. The Mueller obsessives want him to be a deus ex machina who delivers irrefutable grounds for impeachment and I-told-you-sos. But that Mueller may never arrive. He may never even say a word about it in public at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s in part because the Russia piece of his portfolio is under the rubric of a counterintelligence investigation, not a criminal one. This means he\u2019s under no obligation to file any public report at all. He could submit a report to the newly confirmed attorney general, Bill Barr, but Barr can reveal whatever he wants to the public, assuming the president says it\u2019s OK. Or he can reveal nothing at all.\n\nBut waiting for Mueller to prove himself a savior may not pan out, for the simpler reason that he can\u2019t find what doesn\u2019t exist. To say that Trump was morally capable of colluding with Russia is not the same thing as saying that he did.\n\nIf you listen very closely to former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, there was never hard evidence of Trump\u2019s colluding beyond the president\u2019s weird statements and behavior in response to the Russia probe. The problem is that you don\u2019t need an international conspiracy to explain why Trump says and does weird things \u2014 unless you\u2019ve already decided he\u2019s guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s why this tragicomedy will not come to an end with the end of the Mueller probe. The audience, on both sides, had already decided what it was about when they entered the theater.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency, LLC\n\nSomething to Consider If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.
