REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nThe world\u2019s largest burger chain joins Tim Hortons, KFC and Dunkin\u2019 Brands in moving ahead with versions of a plant-based addition to their menus using Beyond Meat\u2019s patties.\n\nShares of Beyond Meat, which have roughly tripled in value since the company\u2019s listing on the stock market in May, surged 17% in early trading, while those of McDonald\u2019s were up marginally.\n\nThe new PLT sandwich, which the company said was without artificial colors, flavors or preservatives, will be priced at C$6.49 plus tax and will be sold in 28 restaurants in southwestern Ontario, Canada from Monday.\n\nBeyond Meat, one of the pioneers of plant-based meat substitutes, is competing fiercely with Silicon Valley-based Impossible Foods for dominance of the plant-based meat market, which Barclays analysts say is expected to explode, growing to an estimated $140 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s already sells vegan burgers in some European countries. It joined hands with Nestle to launch the \u201cBig Vegan TS\u201d plant-based burger in Germany and \u201cThe Big Vegan\u201d burger in Israel. It also offers the \u201cMcVegan\u201d burger in Sweden.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have been asking McDonald\u2019s if they are going to do this. I do think to offer the consumer another option is nice, but again, it remains to be seen on what the uptake is,\u201d said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones.\n\nYarbrough pointed to Tim Horton\u2019s, owned by Canada\u2019s Restaurant Brands International <QSR.TO, which recently pulled back its own Beyond Meat plant-based burger offering this month, citing the better demand for real beef burgers.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said the 12-week test would allow it learn more about real-world implications of serving the PLT, including customer demand and impact on restaurant operations.\n\nSeparately, Nestle on Thursday launched its \u201cAwesome\u201d vegan burger patties in the United States. The company already sells vegan burgers in several European countries under the Garden Gourmet brand.", "description": "McDonald's Corp will test a new \"plant, lettuce and tomato\" sandwich using Beyond Meat's patties in some restaurants in Canada next week, following major rivals' bets on the growing popularity of plant-based alternative meat.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434168248&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P18D", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
