I'm the last defender but I'm far from our goal as well. I had to do it.\"\n\nArsenal lead Palace by two goals to nil after a storming start at the Emirates.\n\nSokratis and David Luiz were both on the scoresheet in under 10 minutes, with Arsenal going into the break ahead.\n\nBut Roy Hodgson's Palace battled back in the second half with Luka Milivojevic netting from the penalty spot.\n\nJordan Ayew equalised on 52 minutes to secure a point for the south London club, with some help from VAR, which ruled out what would have been a later Sokratis winner.\n\n\"We really wanted to win the game so we attacked a lot towards the end to get the third goal,\" added Guendouzi.\n\n\"We allowed spaces [for Palace on the break] but it's because we really wanted to win.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"It's not a mental issue. We didn't manage to hold our advantage. We knew they were a good team, with individual quality, and they played well for their goals.\n\n\"Zaha did well to get a penalty. It's down to us to work so we win these kinds of matches after taking the lead.\"", "description": "Matteo Guendouzi cynically brought down Wilfried Zaha as he attempted to catch Arsenal on the break", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20738838.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-FC-v-Crystal-Palace-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
