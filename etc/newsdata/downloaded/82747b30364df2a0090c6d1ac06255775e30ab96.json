Ms. Souders, and her husband, Bill, with Berkshire Hathaway have the listing.\n\n\n\nThe original house was built by Ireland in 1890. This structure was then purchased by B. George DiLuzio in the 1920s, the alleged straw man for Capone, the infamous mobster, and added onto to make an estate fit for Capone to hide out in, Ms. Souders said.\n\n\n\nMore: Paul Allen\u2019s 414-Foot Yacht Octopus Lists for Over $300 Million\n\nThe 6,500-square-foot home comprises four bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a library, and a gym. There is also a full-room safe protected by 18-inch-thick concrete walls and that's locks date back to between 1915 and 1925, Ms. Souders said. Additionally, there is a 2,400-square-foot guest house comprising two units: one two-bedroom apartment on the second story and one one-bedroom apartment on the first floor, both with kitchens and full bathrooms. It was listed on Aug. 15.\n\n\n\nThe mansion sits on a secluded 36 acres overlooking Timber Lake and the Pine Valley Golf Course, ranked No. 1 by Golf Magazine for 2019-20, and adjacent to the 270-acre Pine Valley Boy Scouts camp. The grounds feature a tennis court, a pool, a hot tub with an antique cabana bar and a seven-car garage. There is also a dock out to the lake and a private road to the golf club.\n\n\n\nFron Penta Good Company: Tupperware Goes After Plastic and Food Waste\n\nThe Pine Valley Golf Course is an exclusive, under-the-radar gold club in the world, hosting memberships to Dan Quayle, George W. Bush, and Sylvester Stallone over the years, Ms. Souders said.\n\n\n\nTucked about a quarter-mile into the woods from the road, the extreme privacy and seclusion made it an ideal hideaway for Capone, Ms. Souders said.\n\n\n\nMs. Souders said that the property also has the potential to be used as a wedding venue or as a community for older residents.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Miabelle Salzano"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-104408?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
