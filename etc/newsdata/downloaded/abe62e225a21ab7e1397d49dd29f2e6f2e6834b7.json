Gavin Newsom, who has repeatedly blasted PG&E \u2014 the nation's largest utility \u2014 for what he calls years of mismanagement and underinvestment that have left its grid less resilient.\n\nTwice over the past two weeks, PG&E has cut power to large areas of Northern and Central California to reduce the risk of its equipment sparking fires. Nearly 2 million people lost electricity earlier this month, and then as many as a half-million this week.\n\nBut PG&E's decision to shut down distribution lines but not long-distance transmission lines may have backfired this time when a blaze erupted near the Sonoma County wine country town of Geyserville.\n\nThe fire burned at least 49 buildings and 34 square miles (65 square kilometers) and prompted evacuation orders for some 2,000 people. No serious injuries were reported.\n\nPG&E said a live, 230,000-volt transmission line near Geyserville had malfunctioned minutes before the fire erupted Wednesday night, and a broken \"jumper\" wire was found on a transmission tower.\n\nPG&E CEO Bill Johnson said it was too soon to say whether the faulty equipment sparked the fire. He said the tower had been inspected four times in the past two years and appeared to have been in excellent condition.\n\nBut PG&E stock plummeted 31 percent on the news. And the blaze could mean wider blackouts ahead.\n\n\"It's kind of a logical next step to say, 'Well, if our high-voltage transmission lines are at risk, we've got to shut those down too,'\" said Alan Scheller-Wolf, professor of operations management and an energy expert at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nPG&E, he said, \"can't win.\"\n\nWith dangerously high winds in the forecast this weekend, the utility said it is planning another major shutdown that could hit 2 million people throughout the region starting Saturday night and last up to two days.\n\nThe preparations came as firefighters simultaneously battled flames in both Northern and Southern California: the fire amid Sonoma County's vineyards, and a wind-whipped blaze that destroyed at least six homes in the Santa Clarita area near Los Angeles and led to evacuation orders covering an estimated 50,000 people.\n\nThe possible link between the wine country fire and a PG&E transmission line contained grim parallels to the catastrophic fire last year that tore through the town of Paradise, killing 85 people and destroying thousands of homes in the deadliest U.S. fire in a century. State officials concluded that fire was sparked by a PG&E transmission line.\n\nThe line that failed this week is newer and should have been more robust, said Michael Wara, director of the climate and energy program at Stanford University. Its failure will probably make PG&E more cautious, which means more widespread blackouts, he said.\n\n\"There's going to be more collateral damage,\" Wara said.\n\nTurning off big transmission lines reduces the stability of the electrical grid, leading to bigger outages, Wara said. Transmissions lines also take longer to re-energize because everything connected to them must be inspected, he said.\n\nPG&E's CEO has said it will take about a decade before widespread outages aren't necessary.\n\nMinimizing blackouts will require PG&E to harden its grid with stronger poles and newer equipment less likely to fall or spark. Cameras, weather sensors and a more segmented grid would allow the company to target blackouts to areas in the most danger.\n\nPG&E began resorting to large-scale shut-offs after its equipment was blamed for several blazes in recent years that killed scores of people, burned thousands of homes and ran up billions of dollars in claims that drove the utility into bankruptcy, where it is still trying to put its finances in order.", "description": "A wildfire in California wine country that may have been caused by a high-voltage transmission line called into question Pacific Gas & Electric's strategy of selectively cutting off power in windy weather to prevent blazes, and could force it to resort to even bigger blackouts affecting millions", "authors": ["Jonathan J.
