Sales were up substantially in Aurora Cannabis \u2019s fourth fiscal quarter, but the company also sustained larger-than-expected negative cash flows.\n\nIn after-hours trading, Aurora\u2019s stock (ticker: ACB) slid more than 10% to $5.82, sustaining the blue mood that\u2019s afflicted pot stocks this year. Rivals like Canopy Growth (CGC) and Tilray (TLRY) also reported bigger losses than investors expected for the June quarter.\n\nUnlike Canopy, Aurora grew its pot sales dramatically in the quarter. Net revenue jumped 52% from the March-quarter level, to reach 99 million Canadian dollars (US$75 million). Sales of recreational cannabis products grew by a similar percentage, to C$45 million, while wholesale bulk sales became a significant business, rising from a couple of million dollars in March to C$20 million.", "description": "Aurora\u2019s stock slid more than 10% after the company reported June earnings, sustaining the blue mood that\u2019s afflicted pot stocks this year.", "authors": ["Bill Alpert"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-106397/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
