Pumpkin is delicious simply roasted, just as you would a butternut or kabocha squash: halved and seeded, brushed with a little oil, drizzled with honey or maple syrup, sprinkled with salt and oven-roasted until fork tender. Just be sure to buy the smaller \u201csugar\u201d pumpkins for cooking, which are creamier than their watery, fibrous carving cousins.\n\nCanned pumpkin, which, ironically, is often made with a variety of different winter squashes, goes beyond pie as well, conveniently bringing orange seasonal essence to savory dishes. This souffle-like spoon bread showcases that quality beautifully. In it, pumpkin puree is stirred into a creamy cornmeal porridge along with familiar pumpkin spices \u2014 cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. But it takes a turn toward savory with the addition of chopped fresh thyme leaves and has just enough maple syrup to give it a hint of sweetness.\n\nOnce enriched with egg yolk and folded with fluffy beaten egg whites, the mixture is poured into a souffle dish and baked. It emerges from the oven resplendent with autumnal color and aroma, elegantly puffed yet still homey, ready to grace your table as a vegetarian main course along soup or salad, or as a side for roasted meat or poultry.\n\nPumpkin Spoon Bread\n\nIngredients\n\n2 tablespoons (28 grams) unsalted butter, plus more for the pan\n\n2 cups (480 milliliters) low-fat milk\n\n3/4 cup (110 grams) yellow cornmeal\n\n1 cup (280 grams) canned pumpkin puree\n\n3 tablespoons maple syrup\n\n2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves\n\n3/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n\n1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n\n1/4 teaspoon ground ginger\n\n1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n\n3 large eggs, separated\n\nSteps\n\nStep 1\n\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees with the rack in the middle. Lightly coat a 2-quart high-sided baking dish, such as a souffle dish, with butter.\n\nIn a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the milk and butter. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium and, stirring all the while, gradually whisk in the cornmeal. Simmer, stirring frequently with a whisk, until the mixture thickens, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the pumpkin puree, maple syrup, thyme, salt, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. Let the mixture cool for 15 minutes. Whisk the egg yolks into the cornmeal mixture until incorporated.\n\nStep 2\n\nIn a stand mixer, or using a handheld electric mixer, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Fold the egg whites into the pumpkin mixture until just incorporated, then pour the mixture into the prepared dish. Bake until golden brown on top and set in the middle, 40 to 45 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.\n\nFrom nutritionist and cookbook author Ellie Krieger, a registered dietitian nutritionist and author who hosts public television\u2019s \u201cEllie\u2019s Real Good Food.\u201d Her new cookbook \u201cWhole in One: Complete Healthy Meals in a Single Pot, Sheet Pan or Skillet\u201d was recently released.
