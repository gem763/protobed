You\u2019re essentially a nun, devoted to your religion for that period of time,\" she continued.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAddie, who was recently named Penthouse magazine\u2019s \u201cPet of the Month,\u201d said she was forbidden form being sexual or even watching movies with her family on the Sabbath.\n\nAfter quitting the church in 2017, she moved to California to become an actress, but struggled to find work despite having a bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University.\n\nInstead, she tried her luck as an exotic dancer, where she says she was contacted by a lot of porn agents.\n\n(Image: iamaddieandrews/Instagram)\n\n(Image: iamaddieandrews/Instagram)\n\nFinally, in January, Addie, who has more than 70,000 Instagram followers, linked with an agent and has had a lot of success in the porn industry.\n\ner family have accepted her new lifestyle.\n\n\u201cI knew that they\u2019d be a little shocked when I told them about my adult work,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy brother said, \u2018I will definitely never watch your porn, but you seem happier than ever, so I support your decision'.\"", "description": "Addie Andrews, who grew up in the US, says her past life within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and her new raunchy job have a lot in common", "authors": ["Image", "Iamaddieandrews Instagram", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703894.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Addie-Andrews.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
