We are reviewing our options and have six months to respond.\"\n\nThe trademark office's decision said OSU can \"overcome this refusal\" through a variety of measures, such as submitting different examples of how it is using the term.\n\n\"This application has issues\"\n\nWashington, D.C., trademark attorney Josh Gerben initially spotted the application, which OSU said it had submitted to protect assets of \"significant value.\"\n\n\"This application has issues,\" Gerben said in a video posted on Twitter. \"In order for a trademark to be registered for a brand of clothing, the trademark must be used in a trademark fashion. In other words, it has to be used on tagging or labeling for the products. In this case, just putting the word 'the' on the front of a hat or on the front of a shirt is not sufficient trademark use.\"\n\nThe Ohio State University has filed a trademark application on the word \"THE.\" The filing, made on August 8th, indicates #OhioState is offering a brand of \"THE\" clothing. Not sure how 'The U' will feel about this one.

In his view, one reason for the denial is that Marc Jacobs, the apparel company, had already applied for its own trademark on \"the,\" as in THE BACKPACK MARK JACOBS, which was approved by the patent office in June but is still under review. Marc Jacobs would likely come out on top if there's a trademark dispute given its earlier filing date, Gerben said.\n\nOhio State University's trademark application for the word \"THE\" has been refused by the USPTO. The USPTO found that: 1. @OhioState is not using the word \"THE\" as a trademark. 2. Marc Jacobs filed an application for \"THE\" before Ohio State made its filing. #The analysis \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/KfQmlVtvQA \u2014 Josh Gerben (@JoshGerben) September 11, 2019\n\nOSU attempted to trademark OSU on clothing in 2017 but found itself at odds with Oklahoma State University. The schools ultimately agreed to allow both institutions to use the acronym, according to the Columbus Dispatch.\n\nStarted in 1870 as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College, OSU changed its name to The Ohio State University in 1878.", "description": "The university uses \"THE\" on its clothing, but the trademark office said the word is \"merely ... decorative\"", "authors": ["Kate Gibson"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/11/dd5ddee9-bca4-42fe-adcd-8d2d3d8f8d1f/thumbnail/1200x630/4c3060c6af6d344141a8c3f25211ec48/rts1wd6b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
