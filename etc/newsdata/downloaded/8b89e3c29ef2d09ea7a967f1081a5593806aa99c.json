The misstatements affect the net foreign-exchange gains each year from 2014 to last year, as well as the first half of this year, the company said.\n\nBaxter, of Deerfield, Ill., warned that its investigation into the matter isn't limited to this time span and said any changes to its previously reported foreign-exchange gains and losses might change its nonoperating-income results.\n\nBaxter has hired outside attorneys and consultants related to the matter. The investigation is in its early stages, the company said.\n\nWhen the investigation is complete, Baxter expects to either amend previous financial statements that it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to correct for errors, or to include in reports for future periods restated results allowing for comparability.\n\n\"The company is working diligently and expeditiously to address the nonoperating related accounting issue,\" Chief Executive Jos\u00e9 Almeida said.\n\nWrite to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 08:14 ET (12:14 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
