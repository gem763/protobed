But the prospect of using a monetary tool usually reserved for deeply-troubled economies has many strategists on Wall Street seriously worried.\n\nNancy Tengler, chief investment strategist at Butcher Joseph Asset Management, believes the practice of implementing negative interest rates is \u201cseriously dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe \u201c$16 trillion in negative yielding debt around the globe\u2014 I don't understand how you account for it as an investor,\u201d Tengler said in an interview on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Final Round.\n\nTrump call for negative interest rates\n\nOn Wednesday President Trump resumed his attack on the Federal Reserve, calling Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other members \u201cboneheads\u201d for not driving \u201cour interest rates down to ZERO, or less.\u201d Trump explained that he wanted negative rates in order to refinance the outstanding $22 trillion in government debt and lengthen the term.\n\n....The USA should always be paying the the lowest rate. No Inflation! It is only the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn\u2019t allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of \u201cBoneheads.\u201d \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTrump is thinking about negative rates from the perspective of a borrower,\u201d Capital Economics Chief U.S. Economist Paul Ashworth wrote in a note to clients. \u201cBut the Fed\u2019s lukewarm appetite for negative rates is partly because officials know that it could cause outrage among savers and drag the central bank into a political maelstrom.\u201d\n\nHow do negative interest rates work?\n\nTypically banks will pay depositors an interest rate for keeping their money with the bank. With negative interest rates, these depositors actually pay the banks a nominal rate to store their money instead of getting paid. Similarly, with government-issued debt, global investors also pay money to hold a bond with negative yields because the premium that they initially paid for it exceeds the total interest they receive over the life of the bond.\n\nHistorically negative interest rates have been used as an anti-recession tool for sputtering growth in weaker economies that have historically undershot inflation expectations. However, over the past few years this phenomenon has become much more common. In fact, Bank of America estimates the market value of negative-yielding debt over the world has shot up to $16 trillion.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch estimates the market value of negative-yielding debt over the world has shot up to $16 trillion.

More\n\nRisk of negative interest rates\n\nWith economic growth around the world slowing down in recent years, central banks have been forced to get creative with their monetary policy tools, including turning to negative interest rates. But a slew of Wall Street strategists have been ringing alarm bells about the potentially negative consequences of negative-yielding debt.\n\nJapan, France and Germany lead the share of negative yielding debt globally. More\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch analysts call negative rates \u201ca growing concern in developed markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarkets have gone into risk-off mode, pushing DM rates ever lower as investors flock to safe-haven assets,\u201d Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Economist Ethan Harris wrote in a recent note to clients. \u201cThe risk is that DM yields continue their race to the bottom, inflating a bond-market bubble that poses yet another risk to the global economy.\u201d\n\nSimilarly analysts at J.P. Morgan, in a recent client note, wrote, \u201cThere is little doubt that negative yields are causing a distortion in the pricing of duration and credit risk as pension funds and insurance companies are forced to move further up the maturity and credit curve to avoid negative yields.\u201d", "description": "President Trump\u2019s latest Twitter escapade against the Fed calls for negative interest rates to jump-start the slowing economy.
