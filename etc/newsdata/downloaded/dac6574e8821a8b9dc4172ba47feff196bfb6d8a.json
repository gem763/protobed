While former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce dominated events south of the border, Littleproud moved less obviously, rarely leaving without speaking to everyone in attendance.\n\nThe pair stopped at the rural fire depot in Stanthorpe on Thursday night, meeting the crews who responded to sprawling fires last month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn failing sunlight, Sugarloaf Brigade first officer James Massey laughed with Littleproud as colleagues showed the Treasurer where the fire came over the hill nearby.\n\nMassey gave an emphatic endorsement of the two men as as future leaders.\n\n\"Definitely, definitely, definitely,\" he said.\n\n\"When they talk to you as if you are a human being, not just paying you lip service, that makes hell of a difference.\n\n\"I think that's where reality comes into it, when we can shake each other's hands. I think the biggest thing they've got is they're in touch with everybody, with the average guy.\"\n\nOutside Stanthorpe, the MPs met third-generation fruit grower Dino Rizzato on Friday. He's worked the land since the 1950s but his dam is so dry the soil has splits big enough to put your hand into.\n\nRizzato praised the federal government's response to the drought and explained the strategic downsizing of his tree stock to Frydenberg, himself not unfamiliar with the husbanding of resources.", "description": "In Josh Frydenberg and David Littleproud, farming communities might have just seen the future Liberal and Nationals leaders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4672%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_782%2C$y_747/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1d4488c211b4f4d9c024b9c3ea3b0b999591aafe", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
