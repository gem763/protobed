Being a refugee for 30 years raises other in terms of education for children, in terms of dependence or the ability to live life normally again,\u201d he told euronews in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe see increasingly that they are people who live in places where it is almost impossible to get a job. Either because it is legally impossible owing to their refugee status. Or simply because they live in countries or areas of these countries it is very difficult to find jobs.\u201d\n\nThe report found three key priorities for host nations which receive large numbers of refugees.\n\nThey include helping to prepare those countries before those arrivals, boosting support for health and education; and helping to create jobs.", "description": "The number of people displaced by conflict worldwide stands at 65 million, according to a new World Bank report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/344571/1000x563_344571.jpg", "published_at": "2016-09-21"}
