Twenty years later, it\u2019s still the rare feature to cent er on such a life . But as the culture has evolved, the film has proved to be very much of its time, with a contradictory legacy that trans viewers have grappled with.\n\nThe movie was based on the tragic true story of Brandon Teena, a 21-year-old Nebraska trans man who was raped and murdered in 1993. His death was the subject of salacious headlines, and it galvanized a small group of trans people to witness the trial and claim him as one of their own.\n\nThe director Kimberly Peirce , then a graduate student at Columbia University, was there, too, traveling with the Transexual Menace activist group as research for the film about Teena she was desperate to make. A self-described butch who, she told me, was questioning her identity at the time, she felt an instant connection with Teena.\n\n\u201cI loved that Brandon shaped himself into his fantasy of himself as a boy and lived as a man and loved women,\u201d Peirce said, \u201cso I always understood that about him \u2014 the courage, the audacity, the invention, the humor, the na\u00efvet\u00e9 to live so authentically and boldly as he wanted.\u201d", "description": "Was the movie a landmark in representation or distressingly exploitative?
