And the new Analogue Pocket console can play games for all of those systems.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got an old cartridge for any of those games you just slot it into the Pocket and it should work straight away, although support for non-Nintendo formats won\u2019t be available at launch.\n\nThe Pocket looks like an old school Game Boy but the 3.5\u201d LCD screen runs at 1600\u00d71440, so the resolution is massively increased. There\u2019s also a 3.5mm headphone jack, a rechargeable lithium ion battery, a microSD card slot, a USB-C charge port, and\u2026. a good old-fashioned Game Boy link cable port.\n\nIf you have the cartridge just slot it in and it\u2019ll work straight off\n\nA Switch style docking unit will also be sold separately sometime after launch, allowing you to connect the Pocket to your TV (analogue or digital), plus support for dual USB inputs and Bluetooth controllers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s not all though, as the Pocket also includes a dedicated chip meant to allow fans and developers to create brand new games for the format.\n\nThe extra FPGA chip not only allows for homebrew software but the support for MiSTer means that the Pocket could end up being an emulation fan\u2019s new best friend. It almost certainly means that support for old arcade coin-ops and other, non-portable, consoles and computers will be added as soon as fans get their hands on it.\n\nThere\u2019s even a music sequencer and synthesiser called Nanoloop, if you just want to make your own chiptunes.\n\nWhat formats does the Analogue Pocket support?\n\nWhen it\u2019s first released the Analogue Pocket will only run cartridges for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance. But after launch support for the Sega Game Gear, Neo Geo Pocket Color, and Atari Lynx will also be added.\n\nSince they\u2019re still recent enough for Sony to be precious about them it\u2019s very unlikely that support for the PSP or PS Vita will be added and it\u2019s the same for Nintendo\u2019s DS and 3DS family of portables.\n\nThe only problem is the Pocket doesn\u2019t have a firm release date, beyond sometime next year, and projects like this do tend to get delayed an awful lot. When it is released though it should cost $199 (\u00a3156).\n\nThe Switch style dock won\u2019t be available until later\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Nintendo patents working Game Boy case for smartphones\n\nMORE: Trademark filing hints at Classic Mini Game Boy", "description": "The Game Boy might be dead but you can make it, and the Game Gear and Atari Lynx, live again thanks to the Analogue Pocket.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3-Analogue-Pocket-Games-3a25_1571300660.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
