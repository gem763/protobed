No matter how much editorial control they had with their mate, Tom Bradby, he\u2019s caused chaos.\n\n\"The royal family are a publicly-funded heritage business, and as anybody that has entered in to it has discovered, the rules go out of the window. Celebrities don\u2019t have the same responsibility, don\u2019t have the love of the nation to deal with.\n\n\"While celebrities could demand \u201capproved quotes, approved pictures, playing hardball, controlling photo opportunities, with the palace there is an uneasy relationship with the media and the public.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAfter the documentary aired on Sunday night Meghan and Harry's friends accused the Royal Family of not giving the couple the recognition they deserve .\n\nIn an astonishing attack, sources claimed Harry and Meghan have \u201csingle-handedly modernised the monarchy\u201d yet advisers remain incapable of \u201charnessing their value\u201d.\n\nMax Foster, an anchor and royal correspondent for US news network CNN, said a source close to the Sussexes told him: \u201cThe institution around the royal family is full of people afraid of and inexperienced at how to best help harness and deploy the value of the royal couple who, they said, \u2018have single-handedly modernised the monarchy\u2019.\u201d\n\nThere were reports that Prince William didn't see the programme before it aired, however the Palace refused to comment on this.\n\n(Image: IAN VOGLER/DAILY MIRROR)\n\nA royal source told the Mirror that senior royals are \u201cconcerned for the couple\u201d, and said the breakdown in their relationship was \"desperately sad\".\n\n\"They\u2019re going completely separate ways and Harry is the one who seems to be visibly struggling.\n\n\u201cIt seems the boy who walked behind their mother\u2019s coffin, which is so vividly seared onto the nation\u2019s consciousness, has never fully recovered, which is an utter tragedy.\n\n\"Charles has sought to help the young men, even that hasn\u2019t helped.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\u201cMany inside the family have said how seeing her sons drifting apart would be the last thing Diana would have wanted.\u201d\n\nBBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said: \"I think they (the royal family) will be pretty horrified actually.\n\n\"One is because whoever wins these legal actions with the newspapers, are the newspapers actually going to change what they do? Because the newspapers don't think they have done anything wrong. They think this is about reporting about what is going on.\n\n\"Secondly, the monarchy is supposed to be a unifying force in this country, and yet a very significant chunk of it, Harry and Meghan, are being divisive. It runs against what the monarchy is doing in these already divisive times.\"", "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry spoke openly about their struggles with the media spotlight in their documentary, but PR expert Mark Borkowski believes it has \"caused chaos\"", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Itv", "Ian Vogler Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20661986.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_harry_and_meghan_an_african_journey_02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
