(Kathryn Gamble/Reuters)\n\nMistrust of the traditional indicators of economic health is all the rage in Democratic circles. It seems not to have infected the former vice president.\n\nJoe Biden had a revealing exchange with a reporter at a campaign stop in Iowa last week, one that put the ideological divide between him and his fellow Democratic primary candidates into stark relief. The reporter asked Biden \u2014 who by this point in the interview was visibly exhausted \u2014 why Iowans should vote for him or, indeed, any other Democratic candidate with the statewide unemployment rate at well below 3 percent under the Trump administration. As the Obama legacy\u2019s apparent heir, the former vice president replied that Trump had inherited a recovering economy from Obama. \u201cThey were employed before [Trump] got elected,\u201d he said, \u201cHe\u2019s not the reason for that employment rate being down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former claim isn\u2019t strictly true \u2014 the unemployment rate in Iowa was 3.4 percent when Trump first took office, and at last count was down to 2.5 percent \u2014 but the local reporter, if she knew that, did not point it out. Instead, she responded by asking why, even if Biden\u2019s claims were true, \u201cpeople [should] want to make a change\u201d at all. After (parsimoniously) insisting that it is \u201cup to [Iowans] to decide,\u201d she pressed Biden yet again: \u201cMake your case.\u201d Biden, running out of steam, dejectedly insisted \u201cI\u2019m not going to.\u201d\n\nPutting aside the bizarre spectacle of a presidential candidate who refuses to make a case for himself, and the related and much-remarked-upon specter of Biden\u2019s declining public lucidity, it\u2019s worth examining the significant rift between Biden and the other leading Democratic candidates that this episode suggested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the other Democratic frontrunners \u2014 Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in particular \u2014 had been asked about the putative economic successes of the Trump administration, they would have followed a predictable script in keeping with their past remarks, attacking the premise of the question. They would have dismissed the numbers out of hand, invoking stagnant wage growth and rising inequality as evidence that the traditional indicators used to measure the health of the domestic economy \u2014 GDP, unemployment rate, and, to a lesser extent, inflation \u2014 are insufficient. They would have argued that those indicators fail to capture the brutality of a system that works for \u201cthe rich and powerful,\u201d don\u2019t consider the costs of health care, and, centrally, fail to account for the distribution of the spoils of growth. Any assertion to the contrary \u2014 that declining unemployment numbers and improved growth indicators portend a generally healthy economy \u2014 is a sign, to a certain type of Democrat, that you don\u2019t understand what the \u201creal economy\u201d looks like.\n\nHere, for example, is Sanders on Twitter:\n\nDespite what President Trump says, it is not \u201ca hot economy\u201d when 43% of households can't afford to pay for housing, food, child care, health care, transportation and a cell phone without going into debt. That is not a hot economy. #SOTU \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) February 6, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s Warren on MSNBC:\n\nThere was a time when saying, \u2018Hey the unemployment rate has gone down,\u2019 that [was] a great thing. But you know, when people are working at minimum-wage jobs that won\u2019t support them or they\u2019re working two, three, or four jobs to try to pay the rent and keep food on the table, then simply saying \u2018The unemployment rate figures have gone down\u2019 just doesn\u2019t get you there.\n\nAnd here\u2019s Cory Booker on CNN:\n\nI love that Trump is taking credit for a recovery that started under Obama, but the substance [is] this: Who is this economy going to work for? And we had a tax plan that was all about giving the wealthiest people more, more of a break. My vision for this country is that we will target things like a massive increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit to actual workers. We\u2019ve got to make sure that this is a shared recovery, because right now, it definitely is not.\n\nIt\u2019s almost too obvious to note that this basic narrative \u2014 that the economy is not what it seems, that the official figures on growth and jobs are, at best, oblique indicators of economic reality \u2014 has percolated through the organs of progressive thought for some time and has recently become a central feature of Democratic politics. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez famously insisted that the only reason the unemployment rate was so low was \u201cbecause everyone has two jobs,\u201d which, of course, betrayed a complete misunderstanding of how the rate is actually measured. With similar distaste for the established metrics of economic success, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer floated a proposal to require the Bureau of Economic Analysis to track the distribution of income growth coincident with its work tracking gross levels of economic growth. \u201cThis legislation,\u201d said the press release, \u201cseeks to cut to the heart of the matter and present a clear and accurate picture of who the economy is really working for.\u201d\n\nBoth amount to the less-intelligent version of the picture painted by the Economic Policy Institute and similar groups, which contend that wage growth for the ordinary worker has stagnated since about 1973, with productivity well outpacing the expected returns to the labor force. Of course, if you measure productivity differently, you\u2019ll get different results. But whatever their merits, these paradigmatic critiques of the economy \u2014 which, of course, have a long history \u2014 have filtered down from, inter alia, the blogosphere, Thom Hartmann\u2019s radio show, and the progressive think-tank world to the mainstream of the Democratic conversation and the vernacular of all its presidential front-runners.\n\nWell, almost all its presidential front-runners. There is still Joe Biden, who, by lapse or intent, seems not to be running a campaign built for the economically dark world his fellow partisans describe. The proposed policy reforms outlined on his website are, much like his public rhetoric, more narrow than systemic, more cautious than bold, more practical than idealistic. They are not the platform of someone who thinks the economy and the country are in dire straits. That almost all of his presidential rivals seem to think those things makes for a primary campaign between two starkly different visions of where the country is and where it should go. The outcome will tell us precisely which vision the Democratic base subscribes to.", "description": "Mistrust of the traditional indicators of economic health is all the rage in Democratic circles.
