(Photo by Robin Alam/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nNo. 10 Notre Dame\u2019s slim College Football Playoff hopes are still alive thanks to the dominance of Julian Okwara. The defensive end recorded three sacks and forced Virginia QB Bryce Perkins to fumble twice in the Irish\u2019s 35-20 win over the No. 18 Cavaliers on Saturday.\n\nOkwara\u2019s third sack ended up as a touchdown for Adetokunbo Ogundeji as the defensive lineman picked the ball up off the turf and ran 23 yards for the score to give Notre Dame a 28-17 lead.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Irish trailed 17-14 at halftime and Virginia surprised Notre Dame with an onside kick to start the second half. However, Virginia\u2019s drive went nowhere and the teams traded punts until a sack played a pivotal role.\n\nThis time, the sack came from Jamir Jones, who hit Perkins as he was about to throw. The ball popped into the air and was caught by Myron Tagovailoa-Amosa, who returned the ball 48 yards to the Virginia 7. Two plays later, running back Tony Jones gave Notre Dame a 21-17 lead.\n\nNotre Dame finished the game with eight sacks.\n\nPerkins had five turnovers\n\nVirginia was undone by its inability to keep the ball and take it away from Notre Dame. Thanks to those two fumbles, Notre Dame scored 14 points in the third quarter despite neither team recording a first down in the period.\n\nVirginia was still in the game after Ogundeji\u2019s touchdown but things got out of hand after Perkins\u2019 fourth turnover of the day. He threw a third-down interception near midfield early in the fourth quarter and Jones scored his third rushing touchdown of the day five plays later.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerkins spent much of the second half avoiding Notre Dame defenders who were seemingly in his face on every play. The dominance of the Irish\u2019s defensive front manifested it in Virginia\u2019s rushing statistics. The Cavaliers ended up with 29 carries for 4 yards. Remember, sacks count as rushing attempts in college football.\n\nJones was Notre Dame\u2019s offensive star\n\nNotre Dame QB Ian Book wasn\u2019t spectacular \u2014 but he wasn\u2019t bad either. Book was a pedestrian 17-of-25 passing for 165 yards and no touchdowns or interceptions. Tight end Cole Kmet capitalized on his performance at Georgia with four catches for 65 yards\n\nThe Irish\u2019s best offensive player was Jones. In addition to those three touchdowns, he averaged over seven yards a carry and tallied 131 yards on 18 rushing attempts. It was a big bounceback for Jones, who had 15 carries for 38 yards in the Irish\u2019s previous two games after rushing for 110 yards against Louisville in the season-opener.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Irish forced Virginia QB Bryce Perkins into five turnovers and sacked him eight times.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/p8lqh6Vv_NDCG51_vPra7A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MTQuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mIzqI4nJkDmexFE7vUNnGQ--~B/aD0yNTE2O3c9MzUyMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/89c36bd0-e244-11e9-b5ff-85a18177d9cf", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
