What does that mean?", "language": "en", "text": "The Oscar and Grammy-winning producer Mark Ronson announced he identifies as sapiosexual this week, speaking about his dating preferences while introducing some fans to a new term they hadn't heard before.\n\nAppearing on \"Good Morning Britain\" Thursday, in a segment with lots of laughter and little information, Ronson was asked about an interview earlier in the show that focused on the phrase, which the Montclair State University's LGBTQ Center describes as \"a person who is emotionally, romantically, sexually, affectionately, or relationally attracted to intelligence and its use.\"\n\nEarlier, the show featured a panel with author Nichi Hodgson, who explained that she has dated people \"across the gender spectrum\" and identifies as sapiosexual, seeking out \"intelligence first\" in her partners. Meanwhile, social scientist Dr. Catherine Hakim, argued that sapiosexuality is \"not very helpful\" as a concept.\n\n\"Now we know you are single,\" host Kate Harraway said to Ronson, adding the producer \"got very involved in our sapiosexual debate this morning.\"\n\n\"And you're identifying as a man who likes intellect?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI didn't know there was a word for it,\" Ronson said. \"I was really enjoying that segment. We were all arguing backstage in the dressing room with a couple of your producers. And yeah, I feel like I am identifying as sapiosexual.\u201d\n\n\"So you're coming out as sapiosexual? This is great news!\" host Ben Shephard said, with Harraway commenting that Ronson was \"out and proud on 'Good Morning Britain.'\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY has contacted Ronson's representatives for further comment.\n\nRonson's interview prompted a flurry of questions online surrounding the term, with some questioning whether his announcement actually constituted \"coming out.\"\n\nWhat does sapiosexual mean?\n\nIn a 2017 interview with the New York Times, Debby Herbenick, a sexual health educator and professor of applied health science at the Indiana University School of Public Health, defined sapiosexuality as more of an identity than a sexual orientation, meaning people can identify as sapiosexual as well as identifying as gay, straight or something else.\n\nThe phrase, according to the New York Times and NPR, originated on the dating site OKCupid, which made \"sapiosexual\" available beginning in 2014 as an identity or orientation that users could designate on their profile.\n\nThe phrase has received some backlash over the years, with reporter Samantha Allen writing for the Daily Beast in 2015 that \"pretentious is not a sexual orientation\" and that \"a person who likes writers is not a scribosexual, a person who likes lawyers is not a jurosexual, and a person who loudly proclaims that they only date smart people might be dangerously full of themselves, but they\u2019re not a 'sapiosexual.'\"\n\nSimilarly, some Twitter users disagreed with \"Good Morning Britain\" for the discussion involving Ronson. Culture writer Tyler Coates commented, \"if I am reading this correctly, Mark Ronson heard the term 'sapiosexual' mere minutes before announcing that as his sexual identity on TV.\"\n\nAs another user wrote, \"Hey folks \u2014 being #sapiosexual is not a valid sexuality, it\u2019s just snobbery & a desire to feel very, very special. Many people find intelligence attractive. You\u2019re not queer*, you\u2019re not oppressed, and you need to stop it.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Sapiosexual: Mark Ronson mentions it Good Morning Britain.
