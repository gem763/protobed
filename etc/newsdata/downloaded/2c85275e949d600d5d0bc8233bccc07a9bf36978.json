Life is fucking hard. Pain is demoralizing, and you're not alone. \u2014 sia (@Sia) October 4, 2019\n\nIn the tweet, which has amassed more than 75,000 likes, Sia revealed her Ehlers Danlos diagnosis. Ehlers Danhlos is a genetic disorder that weakens the connective tissue in your body.\n\nThere are 13 subgroups of the disease, which affects one in 5000 people worldwide. Ehlers Danlos currently has no cure, but can be treated and managed with proper care.\n\nThe disease causes fatigue and chronic pain for suffers, among a long list of other symptoms.\n\nDespite starting her career by revealing next-to-nothing about herself, the 43-year-old has become increasingly personal in recent years.\n\nBack in 2013, the Adelaide-born artist revealed her Oxycodone, Vicodin and alcohol addictions. Just last year the artist shared that she was eight years sober.\n\nAlong with writing her own pop sensations, Sia has also written songs for Adele, Rihanna, Beyonce and Katy Perry.\n\nSia has been releasing music since 1997, but started receiving mainstream praise in 2011 after featuring on David Guetta\u2019s \u2018Titanium\u2019 and Flo Rida\u2019s \u2018Wild Ones\u2019. Since then, she\u2019s had a truly impressive career with a string of hit tracks including \u2018Chandelier\u2019, \u2018Elastic Heart\u2019 and \u2018Cheap Thrills\u2019, just to name a few.\n\nSince coming out with her diagnosis on Sunday morning (Australian time), Sia has been met with a tonne of support from fans. Thousands of fans and fellow sufferers have flocked to the tweet to thank the ARIA-winning artist for sharing her story and helping to normalise the condition.", "description": "Australian pop sensation Sia has taken to Twitter to reveal her Ehlers Danlos Syndrome diagnosis with fans in a heartbreaking tweet.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-645940088.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
