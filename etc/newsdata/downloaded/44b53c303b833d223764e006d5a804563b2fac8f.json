Elaine Thompson/AP\n\nAmazon is one of the US companies people want to work for most, according to a 2019 LinkedIn report. It trails only Alphabet and Facebook on the most desired list.\n\nYoung people who want a job at the Seattle-based retail giant can start to position themselves as a good fit even before they graduate.\n\nRecruiters at Amazon each have their own methods for identifying candidates, Celeste Joy Diaz, the recruiting manager for university programs at Amazon, said.\n\nAs for Diaz, she uses LinkedIn to find the student leaders at top schools, like the student-body president or heads of student organizations. Those students are already displaying Amazon's famous leadership principles, which include qualities like \"insisting\" on high standards and taking ownership.\n\nWhile those interested in a software or development role in Amazon will need to demonstrate a comprehensive knowledge of coding, data structures, and other technical topics, there's more flexibility for roles in business. Those who were active in student government, a student newspaper, or another campus activity could be identified as candidates for Amazon \u2014 even if they didn't major in something clearly business-related.\n\n\"We know people, especially directly out of undergrad, are not majoring directly in say, e-commerce business,\" Diaz told Business Insider. \"Those majors exist, but not a lot of people major in them.\"\n\nThe more prominent mark of a successful Amazon applicant is someone who can show that they display Amazon's leadership principles, Diaz said.\n\n\"We need people who are curious to learn more and curious to problem-solve,\" Diaz told Business Insider. \"There are a lot of ways experience demonstrates that \u2014 through leadership, through other big-scope ownership projects.\"", "description": "Lots of people want to know how to work at Amazon.
