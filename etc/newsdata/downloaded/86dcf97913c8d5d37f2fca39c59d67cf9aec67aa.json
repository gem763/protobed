He made pointed assertions about not only the NBA but also Nike, a close corporate partner of the league.\n\n\u201cFar too many American multinational corporations have kowtowed to the lure of China\u2019s money and markets, by muzzling not only criticism of the Chinese Communist Party but even affirmative expressions of American values,\u201d Pence declared. \u201cNike promotes itself as a so-called \u2018social justice champion,\u2019 but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNike stores in China actually removed their Houston Rockets merchandise from their shelves to join the Chinese government in protest against the Rockets general manager\u2019s seven-word tweet, which read: \u2018Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u2019\u201d\n\nMoving to the NBA, Pence said that some of the league\u2019s \u201cbiggest players and owners,\u201d who \u201croutinely exercise their freedom to criticize\u201d the United States, \u201close their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of the people of China.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of that authoritarian regime.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nVice Pres. Mike Pence slams Nike and the NBA over silence on Hong Kong.\n\n\n\n\"In siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly-owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime.\" https://t.co/KG5KKTL4D0 pic.twitter.com/xDz3Wj0i4K \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) October 24, 2019\n\nThat was too much for Barkley, who has defended the NBA and all-star players whose comments have fueled the ongoing controversy, such as LeBron James and James Harden.\n\nAD\n\nRepeating for emphasis that \u201call American companies are doing business in China,\u201d Barkley told TNT\u2019s viewers, \u201cI thought the criticism of Commissioner Silver and LeBron James was unfair.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaryl Morey, who I like, he can say whatever he wants to, but there are consequences,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut I don\u2019t understand why all these holier-than-thou politicians, if they so want to worry about China, why don\u2019t they stop all transactions with China?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unfair for them to do all their business in China,\u201d Barkley added, \u201cand just because this thing happened, try to make the NBA and our players look bad.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJames, who was in China for a pair of exhibition games between his Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets while the controversy mounted, as was Silver, took flak for criticizing Morey when he returned to the U.S. After telling reporters that the general manager \u201cwasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand,\u201d James took to Twitter in an attempt to further explain himself, writing, \u201cMy team and this league just went through a difficult week.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHarden, whose Rockets were in Japan when their general manager sent his tweet, offered a statement of regret three days later.\n\n\u201cWe apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there,\u201d Harden said, speaking for himself and Houston teammate Russell Westbrook. \u201cFor both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMorey has the right to freedom of speech, but he also has to understand that he works for the Houston Rockets,\u201d Barkley said recently to The Post. \u201cThat\u2019s the No. 1 brand in China for the NBA because of their affiliation with [former Rockets center] Yao Ming. You can\u2019t insult a foreign country and go make money there. \u2026\n\n\u201cEverybody in this country does business in China,\u201d Barkley added. \u201cAll of a sudden, these people want to get on LeBron and Adam Silver for trying to protect their money. Why should [James] sacrifice his money because of some tweet this fool put out? Why should [the NBA] sacrifice their billions?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJames has been highly critical of President Trump, as have some other players in the NBA and several coaches, including Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs and Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors. Asked separately for their thoughts on China earlier this month, Kerr said he needed to read further on the topic before commenting, while Popovich praised Silver\u2019s leadership and contrasted it with \u201cwhat we\u2019ve had to live through the past three years.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump subsequently used a question about the NBA-China issue at a White House briefing earlier this month to take jabs at Kerr and Popovich, accusing the former of reacting \u201clike a little boy\u201d and \u201cshaking\u201d at the thought of speaking out about China. Popovich, Trump said, \u201cdidn\u2019t look quite as scared\u201d as Kerr but still did not \u201cwant to say anything bad\u201d about China after showing a willingness to \u201ctalk badly about the United States.\u201d\n\nPence didn\u2019t single out anyone in the league but it was apparent that, as part of his criticisms of China, he had a goal of highlighting his administration\u2019s unhappiness with the NBA.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA progressive corporate culture that willfully ignores the abuse of human rights is not progressive, it is repressive,\u201d said the vice president. \u201cWhen American corporations, professional sports, pro athletes embrace censorship, it\u2019s not just wrong \u2014 it\u2019s un-American. American corporations should stand up for American values, here at home, and around the world.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLater, on TNT, Silver responded to Pence\u2019s comments by stating that \u201cfrom the first moment\u201d of China\u2019s backlash to Morey\u2019s tweet, \u201cwe\u2019ve adhered to our core values.\u201d He said the NBA was intent on \u201cengaging with the people of China, and India, and throughout Africa and around the world, regardless of their governments.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, where the U.S. government tells us we should be doing business in certain territories or countries, we won\u2019t,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut I\u2019m a firm believer that through sports, independent of government, you bring people together, they acknowledge that commonality, they create empathy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis league, for decades, has been on the ground in China, spreading the game, teaching the values of this game,\u201d he added, \u201cand I think those are core American values, and we\u2019ve never wavered.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Earlier in the day, the vice president said the NBA \"is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary\" of China's \"authoritarian regime.\u201d", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bf7v-LlBLh0v8fybFAn0MzdKiEI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RHZ6PIS4NVBTBDFM7UKZTEJBOU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
