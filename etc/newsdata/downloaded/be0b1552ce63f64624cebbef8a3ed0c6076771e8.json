On Thursday night, the president praised a cease-fire between Turkey and the Kurds, crediting his \"unconventional\" approach for enabling the truce.\n\nTRUMP SLAMS O'ROURKE AT DALLAS RALLY\n\nHe spoke about the violence in northern Syria, saying it was like \u201ctwo kids in a lot.\"\n\n\"You\u2019ve got to let them fight and then you pull them apart,\" he said.\n\nHe called the fighting \u201cnasty\u201d and said it was not fun \u201chaving bullets going all over the place.\u201d\n\nSENIOR MILITARY OFFICIAL SKEPTICAL OF DEAL\n\nTrump has been criticized before for what opponents said was an effort to downplay the crisis for the Kurds. Earlier in the week, the president said Syria has \"a lot of sand over there. So there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\" He said the Kurds, a U.S. ally credited with their effort to dismantle ISIS, are \"no angels.\"\n\nThe president has insisted that the move to withdraw troops will prove to be wise and praised the cease-fire as a \"great day for civilization.\"\n\n\"Everybody agreed to things that three days ago they would have never agreed to,\" he told reporters. \"That includes the Kurds. The Kurds are now much more inclined to do what has to be done. Turkey is much more inclined to do what has to be done.\"\n\nThe White House on Wednesday released a letter in which Trump warned Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that the sanctions could destroy his economy and that the world \u201cwill look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, said he welcomed the cease-fire but wanted to know what America\u2019s role in the region would be and why Turkey was facing no consequences for its invasion.\n\n\u201cFurther, the cease-fire does not change the fact that America has abandoned an ally,\u201d he said on the Senate floor.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump on Thursday likened the Turkish offensive against the Kurds to a schoolyard fight, saying, \u201csometimes you have to let them fight a little while\u201d before you separate them.", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
