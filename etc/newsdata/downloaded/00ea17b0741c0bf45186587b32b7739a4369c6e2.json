Others were gassed inside an adapted railway carriage, set on tracks to trick prisoners into believing that they were being transported to another destination.\n\nBut the point where certain knowledge of the Nazis\u2019 plans for mass murder could have shaken inmates into action had already passed. \u201cThe one thing the Nazis succeeded in at in the camp was that they pushed us inmates to a point where we became indifferent to the horror around us,\u201d Dunin-W\u0105sowicz told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cWhen your friends were being beaten up around you, your first thought was, at least they didn\u2019t get me. When they carried out public executions at lunchtime, you were distraught not because people were dying, but because you were missing out on food. We existed at a level where our empathy had been beaten out of us.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, 74 years after escaping near-certain death, Dunin-W\u0105sowicz will for the first time face one of the men who stopped him and the thousands of others from escaping from the concentration camp east of what is now the city of Gdansk, in Poland.\n\nHe will be the first witness to give testimony in what is likely to be one of the last trials against an individual charged over the Holocaust. A former camp guard and member of the SS Totenkopfsturmbann (Death\u2019s Head Battalion), Bruno Dey, has been charged by a court in Hamburg with accessory to the murder of 5,230 people. Both the accused and the co-plaintiff are 93.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A gas chamber at the Stutthof concentration camp.

As a member of Szare Szeregi (Grey Ranks), a paramilitary scouting organisation, and then the Polish Home Army, he had carried out minor acts of sabotage, vandalising Nazi posters and reporting on the movement of the Wehrmacht.\n\nHe faced squalid living conditions in the camp: around 5,000 of the victims listed on Dey\u2019s charge sheet died of a typhus epidemic after being denied food, water and medication. Toothaches, Dunin-W\u0105sowicz recalled, were generally treated by pulling out the infected teeth. Anaesthetic was unavailable; patients were simply knocked unconscious ahead of operations.\n\nHe survived the camp partly thanks to a Polish doctor who advised him to drop a log on to his foot so he could get a break from gruelling forced labour shifts in the sick bay. At regular intervals, the same doctor would smash up his toe again so the young prisoner couldn\u2019t be drafted back to work in the field.\n\nLater, he and his brother managed to get vaccinated because they had been assigned administrative tasks that made them indispensable to the organisers of the concentration camp.\n\nIn January 1945, with the Soviet army advancing, the two brothers were made to join one of the death marches in the direction of the town of L\u0119bork. Snow was deep and temperatures were freezing. Those who could walk no further were shot on the spot, creating a vicious cycle where those at the back of the march exhausted themselves further by racing not to be the last in line.\n\nIn what he described as a \u201cmiracle\u201d, the Dunin-W\u0105sowicz brothers managed to escape into the woods one night. Thousands of others on the march were later executed or drowned in the freezing Baltic sea.\n\nFor the first few decades after the end of the war, Dunin-W\u0105sowicz tried to suppress the memories of his time in the camp. Around ten years ago, something changed: he felt he wanted younger people to know exactly what had happened in the camps, he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bruno Dey, 93, in court in Hamburg.

But he has denied being guilty of accessory to murder, and complained that the trial had \u201cdestroyed\u201d the last years of his life.\n\nIn Dunin-W\u0105sowicz\u2019s memory, SS guards like Dey carried out three types of tasks: overlooking the camp from watchtowers, armed with machine guns, watching over prisoners while they worked outside the compound, and escorting them to places where they were executed.\n\nEven if brutal beatings were usually administered by the kapos \u2013 mostly German prisoners tasked with supervising other inmates \u2013 he said the SS guards played a crucial role: \u201cThe kapos beat prisoners to death because they were being supervised. Their viciousness was an expression of their will to survival \u2013 they had to excel at their task to avoid being made ordinary prisoners again.\u201d\n\nHis aim in joining the prosecution, he said, was not to \u201cseek revenge\u201d: \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily want him to go to prison. But ultimately one has to pay for one\u2019s mistakes. It\u2019s a question of justice.\u201d\n\nWhat matters to him now is that the European public remembers what took place in the camps, and remembers that the prisoners included nationals from more than 20 Europeans nations. He said: \u201cIt would give me closure if this trial helps the next generation of Germans, of Poles, of all Europeans, to learn a lesson when it comes to the revival of fascism, racism and xenophobia.\u201d", "description": "Polish resistance fighter who escaped Stutthof will face Bruno Dey, accused of being accessory to murder of 5,230 people", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41680c2bd84b0e3097d23826f086b7e8bfafdb62/0_450_8104_4864/master/8104.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5d98a8734357c969964424659b850110", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
