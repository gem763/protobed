Announced back in February as part of the Colorado company\u2019s first-ever Kickstarter campaign, RVR presents a bit of a change for Sphero in a number of key ways.\n\nFor starters, it\u2019s a move away from the remote control ball design that has defined the majority of its projects since the Orbotix days. RVR is a four wheel system \u2014 and more than that, in keeping with Sphero\u2019s relatively recent focus on education, aimed at helping kids learn languages like Python and JavaScript.\n\nIt\u2019s also designed to help teach some of the fundamentals of robotics. Though, as Sphero notes, it\u2019s still drivable right out of the box, with minimal assembly required. Beyond that, users can hook in third party boards like Raspberry Pi and Arduino through the USB port, along with products from the recently acquired LittleBits.\n\n\u201cWhen we launched RVR on Kickstarter earlier this year, we were blown away by the response,\u201dco-founder and Chief Creative Officer. Adam Wilson said in a release \u201cOur community of makers, developers, and teachers all rallied around RVR to make it a huge success even before they could get their hands on one. RVR has significantly extended our reach to makers of all ages, and of all coding abilities. We can\u2019t wait to see what everyone creates with RVR.\u201d\n\nThe system starts at $250 through Sphero\u2019s online shop and select retailers.", "description": "Following a crowdfunding campaign that raised an impressive $1 million earlier this year, Sphero\u2019s STEM/STEAM kit RVR is now on sale.
