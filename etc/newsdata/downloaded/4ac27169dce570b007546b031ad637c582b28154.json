But the bloodshed is not evenly distributed.\n\nIn Mexico, the region's second most populous country, 33,753 homicide victims in 2018 set a record for the second year in a row; 17,142 victims in the first half of this year likely means 2019 will set a new mark.\n\nIn Brazil, the most populated country in the region, homicides fell 13% between 2017 and 2018, but that still means 51,589 people were killed. Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, regarded as some of the world's most violent countries, have also seen declines, as has Colombia, long riven by political and drug-related violence.\n\nThe regional homicide rate has increased 3.7% annually over the past decade \u2014 three times the population growth rate of 1.1%.\n\n\"It's a heterogeneous region,\" Robert Muggah, research director at Brazil's Igarap\u00e9 Institute and an expert on crime and crime prevention, told Business Insider this spring. \"There's huge variations in terms of homicides, from Chile through to Mexico and Venezuela and Brazil.\"\n\nChile's 2.7 homicides per 100,000 people in 2018 were about half the US's 5.3 \u2014 Mexico and Brazil's 25 per 100,000 and Venezuela's 80 were many times more.\n\n\"There isn't one monolithic factor\" that explains this killing, Muggah said. \"I think that's sort of obvious, but it's important to say.\"\n\n\"But there are what we call invariant factors \u2014 factors that seem to correlate with homicide across time and space \u2014 and there are a few of them.\"", "description": "Despite some national declines, homicides in Latin America have only increased in recent years, and there's no single reason for the rise in killing.", "authors": ["Christopher Woody"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7075a22e22af6e90439e92-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
