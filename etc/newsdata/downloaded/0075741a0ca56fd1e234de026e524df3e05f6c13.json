Volume topped 18.2 million shares, well more than double the full-day average of about 7.1 million shares.\n\nThe selloff was enough to make the stock the biggest loser in the SPDR Health Care Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLV, -0.37% and the second-biggest decliner in Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.95% , behind the 6.5% selloff in Boeing Co. BA, -6.79% shares. The price decline of $7.43 was shaving about 50 points off the Dow\u2019s price, which was down 209 points.\n\nJ&J said it was recalling a \u201csingle lot\u201d of its Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder, \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d after a U.S. Food and Drug Administration test found \u201csub-trace levels\u201d of chrysotile asbestos. The company said the contamination, which was no greater than 0.00002%, was found in samples from a single bottle purchased from an unnamed online retailer.\n\n\u201cIn parallel, [Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.] (JJCI) has immediately initiated a rigorous, thorough investigation into this matter, and is working with the FDA to determine the integrity of the tested sample, and the validity of the test results,\u201d JJCI said in a statement.\n\nThe J&J unit emphasized that \u201cat this early stage\u201d of the investigation, JJCI can\u2019t confirm whether the tested product was authentic or counterfeit, or whether the sample was taken from a sealed bottle or if cross-contamination from another product caused a false-positive reading.\n\nThe company\u2019s implied skepticism of the FDA\u2019s findings comes as J&J is facing more than 14,000 lawsuits alleging its baby powder and talc products cause cancer, while the company vigorously denies such claims.\n\nLast year, a St. Louis jury ruled that the company had to pay $4.7 billion to 22 women and their families who said the baby powder gave them ovarian cancer.\n\nAnd last Dec. 14, J&J\u2019s stock plunged 10%, its biggest one-day percentage decline in over 18 years, after Reuters reported the company knew for decades that its baby powder was contaminated with asbestos. The company said at the time that the Reuters report was \u201cfalse and inflammatory,\u201d and that its baby powder was \u201csafe and asbestos-free.\u201d\n\nJ&J continues to deny the claims. On Friday, the company said in a statement:\n\n\u201cJJCI has a rigorous testing standard in place to ensure its cosmetic talc is safe and years of testing, including the FDA\u2019s own testing on prior occasions--and as recently as last month--found no asbestos. Thousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos.\u201d\n\nAnalyst Damien Conover at Morningstar said although the recall increases the uncertainty around J&J\u2019s product governance, it doesn\u2019t change his bullish stance on the company as he doesn\u2019t expect the baby powder litigation to have a major impact on its consumer products brands.\n\n\u201c[M]any of the company\u2019s brands are marketed under different names, so any brand damage done to baby powder is unlikely to transfer to other company brands,\u201d Conover wrote in a note to clients. \u201cAlso, we expect J&J to pull out all the stops to support the baby powder brand, which should limit brand damage as the firm has a successful track record of defending brands.\u201d\n\nConover actually raised his stock fair value estimate to $134 from $130, citing increased projections for the company\u2019s late-stage pipeline drugs.\n\nMeanwhile, the recall is the latest setback for J&J regrading product safety, as the company was ordered earlier this month by a Philadelphia jury to pay $8 billion to a Maryland man who said using the company\u2019s antipsychotic Risperdal as a child caused enlarged breasts. The company is also facing multiple claims regarding its role in fueling the opioid crisis.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Major drug distributors in talks to settle opioid lawsuits for $18 billion.\n\nJ&J\u2019s stock has slipped 0.2% year to date, while the health-care ETF has gained 6.2% and the Dow industrials has climbed 15.0%.", "description": "Shares of Johnson & Johnson suffers another blow Friday related to product safety, as the consumer products giant\u2019s recall of some baby powder, after...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT625_Johnso_ZG_20191018122618.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
