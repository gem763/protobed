Sondland from discussing the administration\u2019s Ukraine dealings ahead of a closed-door session on Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nMr. Sondland was part of a phone-text chain with other diplomats that is at the heart of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nDemocrats secured potentially damning texts from another diplomat, Kurt Volker, in which a circle of officials warn the U.S. appeared to be withholding aid from Ukraine in exchange for dirt on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nMr. Trump highlighted a message from Mr. Sondland to the other diplomats in which he refutes the existence of any quid pro quo.\n\nSEE ALSO: Democrats accuse Trump of obstruction after Sondland testimony delay\n\nThe decision to bar Mr. Sondland from testifying, however, sparked speculation that White House officials would rather accept the ire of Democrats crying \u201cobstruction\u201d than allow the ambassador to offer information.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
