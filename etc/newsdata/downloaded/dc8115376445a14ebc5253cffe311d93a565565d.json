In the other she documented her private reflections and memories, including a single sexual encounter with the writer Arthur Koestler (a \u201cmiserable, joyless episode\u201d) and her efforts, through psychotherapy, to \u201cget myself into a condition to be married\u201d.\n\nShe had no more compassion for men than she did for women. In one entry Highsmith writes that \u201cthe American male does not know what to do with a girl once he has her. He is not really depressed or inhibited by his inherited or environmentally conceived Puritan restraints: he simply has no goal within the sexual situation\u201d.\n\nHighsmith\u2019s diaries, which run to more than 8,000 pages, have been pored over by biographers, but have never before been made public, or in this case interwoven into a single narrative of the life of a complex woman who thought deeply about themes of good and evil, loneliness and intimacy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest American author Patricia Highsmith at home in 1970.

But there is a question over how far Highsmith can now be assimilated into contemporary culture. Antisemitic, racist and misogynistic, she wrote in a way that could make for extremely difficult reading.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s incredibly modern because she speaks to irrationality; she was a lesbian who hated women, totally politically incorrect in lots of ways, and certainly not a poster girl for the feminist movement,\u201d said Wilson, who warned that hundreds of pages of Highsmith\u2019s views, undiluted by explanation from friends and colleagues, could be wearing.\n\n\u201cShe could be a monstrous, violent and quite unpleasant woman. She hated black people, she hated Jews, and she hated women, but there are also reasons why she was like that,\u201d he says, citing her mother\u2019s rejection and a clumsy attempt by her father to seduce her when she was a teenager. But, according to one friend she was sexually abused by a couple of men, possibly travelling salesmen, when she was four or five.\n\nHighsmith herself was aware of the unpalatable nature of her views, and it is likely that they caused her distress. \u201cNo writer would ever betray his secret life,\u201d she wrote to a friend in 1940. \u201cIt would be like standing naked in public.\u201d\n\nThe diaries, which are held in the Swiss Literary Archives, were discovered by her editor, Anna von Planta, and Daniel Keel, the literary executor of her estate. Von Planta said she had no interest in censoring or downplaying the unpleasantness of Highsmith\u2019s views, in large part because Highsmith appears to have anticipated their publication.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to show how Patricia Highsmith became Patricia Highsmith,\u201d Von Planta told the New York Times. \u201cAnd to have her tell about her life, her thoughts, her concerns, the making of her work, in her own words.\u201d\n\nThe diaries\u2019 publication could help to again reveal that, contrary to popular imagination, creativity is not necessarily rooted in our best instincts.\n\n\u201cShe said she was born under a sickly star, and she knew from her earliest consciousness she was difficult, and that she had a problem with an existential idea of being,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe diaries question this over and over again. Fascinating, but a strong brew. You won\u2019t be able to read them in one go.\u201d", "description": "Controversial views of the late American writer to be revealed by publication of her private notebooks", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ada88626668b61464e0acd98476ed9ce7dec240/0_103_2837_1702/master/2837.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=13d8dbf916bd1a05fd967120ce87c4b9", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
