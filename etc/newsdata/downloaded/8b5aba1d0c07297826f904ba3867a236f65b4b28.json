Add Interest\n\n\"The privilege of serving my country is not only rooted in my military service, but also in my personal history. I sit here, as a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army, an immigrant. My family fled the Soviet Union when I was three and a half years old,\" is how he began his opening statement Tuesday behind closed doors to House impeachment investigators.\n\nMark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nAfter climbing through the ranks of the U.S. Army -- earning a Purple Heart along the way after being wounded in an IED explosion in Iraq -- and now advising the White House on European issues as a senior member of the National Security Council, Vindman seems to have realized the dream many immigrants have.\n\n\"Upon arriving in New York City in 1979, my father worked multiple jobs to support us, all the while learning English at night,\" he continued, according to his prepared remarks. \"He stressed to us the importance of fully integrating into our adopted country. For many years, life was quite difficult. In spite of our challenging beginnings, my family worked to build its own American dream.\n\n\"I have a deep appreciation for American values and ideals,\" he said, \"and the power of freedom.\"\n\n\"I am a patriot,\" he said, \"and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics.\"\n\nBut he finds himself at the center of a political firestorm.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nVindman has defied White House orders by appearing before a House impeachment probe looking into the circumstances surrounding a July 25 phone call between President Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.\n\nThe man born in Ukraine -- who fled to the U.S. -- was listening to that call. What he heard alarmed him.\n\n\u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d his statement said of Trump\u2019s pressuring the Ukrainian government to investigate the family of former Vice President Joe Biden, who is now running for president.\n\nJust before he testified Tuesday, Trump tried to dismiss Vindman -- the first current White House official to testify in the House impeachment inquiry -- as a \u201cNever Trumper,\u201d but providing no evidence of that.\n\nSupposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call \u201cconcerned\u201d today\u2019s Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was? Can\u2019t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019\n\n\"For over twenty years as an active duty United States military officer and diplomat, I have served this country in a nonpartisan manner, and have done so with the utmost respect and professionalism for both Republican and Democratic administrations,\" Vindman was to testify.\n\n\u201cFor many years, life was quite difficult,\u201d said Vindman, now in his early 40s.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Vindman and his father Semyon immigrated to the States with his twin brother Yevgeny, older brother Leonid and maternal grandmother. His mother died in Kyiv before they left.\n\nVindman and Yevgeny followed in the footsteps of Leonid, earning commissions in the Army.\n\n\"For more than two decades, it has been my honor to serve as an officer in the United States Army. As an infantry officer, I served multiple overseas tours, including South Korea and Germany, and a deployment to Iraq for combat operations. In Iraq, I was wounded in an IED attack and awarded a Purple Heart,\" he wrote matter-of-factly.\n\nThen, as a Foreign Area Officer, a role that deals with political-military affairs, Vindman served in the U.S. embassies in Kyiv and Moscow. His last post in that role was in Washington, D.C., serving as a Eurasian specialist before being tapped to be a part of the National Security Council in 2018.\n\nVindman\u2019s twin brother Yevgeny is also an Army lieutenant colonel rank who works in the White House as part of the National Security Council, according to the Times. He is a lawyer handling ethics issues, and his office is across from Vindman\u2019s.\n\nCarol Kitman, a photographer who\u2019s online portfolio appears to document the lives of the Vindmans, wrote in a caption on her website, \u201cThe situation of their lives resonated because my mother also was brought here by family - a very small girl who had lost her mother in the old country.\u201d\n\nShawn Thew/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nLeading up to Tuesday\u2019s testimony, Vindman\u2019s detractors assailed his background-- questioning where his loyalties lie.\n\n\u201cIt seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense,\u201d former GOP Rep. Sean Duffy said on CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019s concerned about American policy, but his main mission was to make sure that the Ukraine got those weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has an affinity for the Ukraine, he speaks Ukrainian, and he came from the country, and he wants to make sure they\u2019re safe and free. I understand that,\u201d Duffy added.\n\nJohn Yoo, a former Department of Justice official in the Bush administration, said on Fox News Channel that it was \u201castounding\u201d that Vindman, who is fluent in Ukrainian and Russian, reportedly communicated in English with Ukrainian officials about how to handle Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.\n\n\u201cYou know, some people might call that espionage,\u201d Yoo said.\n\nOther Republican's said questioning Vindman's patriotism was \"shameful.\"\n\nVindman, in his remarks, said he was proud to be an immigrant serving at the highest levels of the U.S. government.\n\n\"It has been a great honor to serve the American people and a privilege to work in the White House and on the National Security Council. I hope to continue to serve and advance America\u2019s national security interests,\" he concluded.\n\nBut Alexander Vindman's story is not over.\n\nABC News' Benjamin Siegel contributed to this report.", "description": "Who is Alexander Vindman, the Army officer defying the White House?
