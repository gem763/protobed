Long before her union, the United Auto Workers, declared a work stoppage this weekend, the 29-year-old mother of one began socking away savings to prepare for a long battle with the Detroit automaker.\n\n\u201cI could live out three months,\u201d Kelly, an apprentice moldmaker at the GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, told HuffPost. \u201cI 100% feel this strike is necessary.\u201d\n\nNo one knows how long the largest auto strike in more than a decade will last. But workers like Kelly have dug in and don\u2019t plan to bend. They look at how well GM has done in recent years \u2015 the company pulled in roughly $11 billion in pre-tax profits in 2018, and about $35 billion over the last three years combined \u2015 and wonder why they shouldn\u2019t have a larger piece of the pie.\n\n\u201cThey shuffle us into a room every six months and praise these record-breaking profits, but they expect us to give back,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe just do not understand right now why the company is still acting like we\u2019re in bankruptcy when for the last four years they\u2019ve been extremely profitable.\u201d\n\nHer outlook goes a long way in explaining why nearly 50,000 UAW members have stopped production at more than 50 GM facilities nationwide. The union said Sunday that the two sides remain far apart in negotiations, with a raft of outstanding issues to resolve. But the root of the deadlock is not hard to grasp.\n\nGM very much wants to keep its costs down as auto sales slow and the company makes bets on electric vehicles. But GM workers told HuffPost they still recall the sacrifices the union made as the industry foundered in 2007, before the company returned to profitability. The concessions they made back then, including a two-tier wage system, still cast a shadow over the current talks.\n\nThough workers have shared in GM\u2019s strong performance since then, with profit-sharing bonuses that can top $10,000, they see no reason to bend to the company given its recent track record.\n\nBill Pugliano via Getty Images The sign at United Auto Workers Local 598 in Flint, Michigan, on Monday after the UAW declares a national strike against GM.\n\nTo be clear, few people away from the bargaining table know the biggest hurdles to a deal. Union leadership has not shared the company\u2019s proposal with members. GM disclosed a few pieces of its offer, including promises to allocate production to two facilities that had been idled, an overall investment of $7 billion in UAW-represented plants, and worker bonuses of $8,000 for ratifying the contract \u2015 what the company deemed a \u201cstrong offer\u201d made in good faith.\n\nBut pay hikes and other benefits were not specified. The union and GM could easily be at a deadlock over wage increases, health care costs and other, even trickier issues that were expected to be central to the talks.\n\nWorkers said they believe GM and the union need to bridge class divisions within plants. It takes newer workers eight years to reach the top pay rate of roughly $30 per hour earned by longer-term veterans. That\u2019s better than in the wake of the financial crisis, when new hires had no way of reaching that rate at all \u2015 a compromise the union made as the company veered toward bankruptcy.\n\nBut many workers believe the \u201cin-progression\u201d system, as it\u2019s known, is still too long a slog. After all, it takes the duration of two collective bargaining agreements to complete it.\n\nThey also want to limit GM\u2019s use of temporary workers. The company says about 7% of its U.S. workforce is temps, though the share can vary significantly from department to department and shift to shift. Some workers temp for two years or more before transitioning to full-time and gaining job security. GM may be pointing to foreign-owned transplants like Nissan, where temporary workers are more widespread, and asking for similar leeway.\n\nIn a letter to members Sunday, UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said the outstanding issues include the in-progression wage system as well as \u201cthe treatment of temporary workers.\u201d\n\nJEFF KOWALSKY via Getty Images Workers walking out of the GM facility in Flint, Michigan, early Monday morning.\n\nBeth Baryo, a parts handler at GM\u2019s processing center in Burton, Michigan, said guaranteeing that more temps convert to traditional status was a priority for her and her co-workers. Baryo started with GM in 2014. She temped for 18 months before becoming a full-time employee, and she hasn't yet reached the top pay rate.\n\nShe was out on the picket line at her plant at midnight Monday morning and found it was difficult to convince some temps to join the strike because they felt vulnerable. She estimated that nearly half the department on her evening shift is temporary, in part because the shift is less desirable.\n\n\u201cThey have temps who come in and are next to people making twice what they make\u2026 A lot of them were scared to even walk out,\u201d Baryo said. \u201cWe had to explain to them, \u2018No, if you walk out with us, [the union is] going to fight for you.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI would be scared, too.\u201d\n\nCrain\u2019s Detroit Business reported Monday that GM wants workers to bear a significantly larger share of the health care burden. The workers generally have excellent health coverage and are responsible for around 3% or 4% of the cost. According to Crain\u2019s, GM\u2019s initial offer would have hiked that share to 15%, a proposal the union rejected.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to start eroding a lot of the progress our forefathers made through the union,\u201d said Baryo.\n\nWhatever contract the union reaches with GM would serve as a template for its talks with Ford and Fiat Chrysler, the remaining two-thirds of the Big Three. But even if the UAW leadership can squeeze a deal out of GM that they like, it doesn\u2019t mean it will go over with workers like Baryo.\n\nWhen the union was negotiating its last contracts with the Big Three four years ago, workers at Fiat Chrysler voted down the initial tentative agreement the union had secured. Their rejection eventually led to a better deal allowing for in-progression workers to reach top pay. If rank-and-file GM workers don\u2019t like the offer put before them, they can take a page from the 2015 playbook and vote it down, sending everyone back to the table.\n\nThe last strike at GM lasted just two days in 2007 and inflicted minimal pain on the company and workers. A strike that lasts weeks would be far more damaging. Analysts say the plant closures could cost GM at least $50 million a day in revenue. It wouldn\u2019t be long before the strike would be visible on dealer lots.\n\nAnd even though the strike is taking place only in the U.S., it could also hurt production in Mexico and Canada due to the company\u2019s integrated production across North America.\n\nAs for workers, the UAW has grown a healthy strike fund of more than $700 million, thanks in part to a temporary dues increase to prepare for this year\u2019s contract fight. But workers would still collect only $250 a week in strike pay, hardly enough to carry a single worker, let alone a family.\n\nKelly brought her 6-year-old son out on the picket line Sunday and to her union hall on Monday. Even though a long work stoppage would be financially trying, she said she felt reassured when she saw the sense of unity among her co-workers.\n\n\u201cWe as a membership have prepared to say this could be a long strike,\u201d she said. \u201cWe stood by GM in bankruptcy. We took concessions and we understood why we needed to at that time. If this was 2007, that would be understandable. But not now, when it just looks like corporate greed.\u201d", "description": "It's not that complicated.
