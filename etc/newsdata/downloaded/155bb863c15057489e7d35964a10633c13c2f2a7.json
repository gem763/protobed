So if you're a foodie you are guaranteed to like the taste. It has a deeper, rich savoury flavour than most other oils,' Lee told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nThe Australian food author said 'cooking with duck fat is healthier than butter, pork fat and beef fat' but 'olive oil is still preferable'.\n\n'It's good to switch up your oils occasionally and use something different as diversity in diet is great for gut health, however the benefits of olive oil still outweighs the benefits of duck fat,' she said.\n\n'Duck fat contains more monounsaturated fat than some other animal fats such as butter (26 per cent) and beef dripping (43 per cent) and coconut oil, (6 per cent) but it is an occasional food.'\n\nThe holistic chef suggested cooking with duck fat in moderation as it's high in unsaturated fatty acids.\n\n'Good fats to use include monounsaturated fats such as olive oil, avocado oil, and nut oils like macadamia,' she said.\n\n'Olive oil has 75 per cent monounsaturated fat and contains antioxidants too so it is healthier than duck fat and would be preferable to use. 40 per cent of duck fat is oleic acid, compared to olive oil, which is 71 per cent oleic acid.'\n\nShe said the best way to cook with duck fat is at a moderate temperature.\n\n'So baking and slow cooking is the best way to use it. If you\u2019re having a slow roast, rub it on chicken and use it to cook the spuds or veg! You can also use it to sear meat,' she said.\n\nMeanwhile, nutritionist and accredited practicing dietitian Lyndi Cohen (pictured) said cooking with duck fat is not as healthy as you think\n\nMeanwhile, nutritionist and accredited practicing dietitian Lyndi Cohen said cooking with duck fat is not as healthy as you think.\n\n'Duck fat has attracted a health halo because it's made up on more than 50 per cent monounsaturated fat,' Lyndi told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'Monounsaturated fat has been shown to be beneficial for heart health. However, Duck fat is absolutely not a health food.'\n\nWhen it comes to healthy fats, Lyndi said extra virgin olive oil is the 'healthiest choice'.\n\n'Extra virgin olive oil contains 75 per cent monounsaturated fats as well as antioxidants that may be protective for your health in addition to having a higher smoke point than duck fat,' she said.\n\n'No reputable, university-qualified nutrition professional would recommend duck fat be used in place of extra virgin olive oil. It's really uninformed and misleading to suggest that duck fat is any way a health food.\n\n'As a plant-based oil, I also think extra virgin olive oil is a much more conscious alternative.\n\n'It's fine to use duck fat occasionally for flavour, but don't be tricked into thinking it's healthy fat source to eat every day.'", "description": "Daily Mail Australia has spoken to celebrity chef Pete Evans and leading nutritionists on the benefits of duck fat - and whether foodies should use it as a substitute for other oils in everyday cooking.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/05/19283316-0-image-a-52_1570164577761.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
