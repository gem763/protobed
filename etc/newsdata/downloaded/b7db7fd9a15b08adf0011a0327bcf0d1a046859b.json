A source in the opposition Labour Party said it will back an election only if a delay to Brexit is agreed first, to ensure that Britain does not leave the EU without a deal before the vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nPROSPECTS\n\nDefeat in either of Tuesday's votes in parliament would appear to scupper Johnson's plans to leave the EU with an agreement on Oct. 31. If the EU offers a delay, he is obliged to by law to accept it, although government ministers have still not ruled out somehow leaving with no deal on that date.\n\nEven if Johnson wins both votes on Tuesday, his opponents in parliament could have another chance to ambush the government with amendments that could wreck his plans by demanding a much closer post-Brexit relationship with the EU.\n\nThe pound was flat at $1.2946 in London trading. Foreign exchange markets now price in Britain either leaving with a deal or delaying Brexit, or possibly both.\n\nJohnson said the best way to avoid a no-deal Brexit would be to approve his Brexit legislation, adding that the country was tired of the discussion in parliament.\n\nOpposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said his Labour Party would oppose both the bill itself and the accelerated timetable for enacting it. A small Northern Irish party that had propped up Johnson's government has said it will oppose the bill.\n\nTuesday's votes could be very close and may depend on whether Johnson can win over enough pro-Brexit Labour rebels to offset opposition from Conservative lawmakers pushed out of his parliamentary party for defying him on earlier Brexit votes.\n\n\n\n\n\nBREXIT IN PLAY\n\nMore than three years since the United Kingdom voted 52% to 48% to leave the European Union, the Brexit crisis is straining Britain's political and constitution system to the breaking point.\n\nJohnson confounded his opponents by agreeing a Brexit deal with the EU on Thursday. But parliament did not pass a motion on Saturday expressing support for the deal, which meant Johnson was required to write to the EU asking for a delay.\n\nHe complied - reluctantly sending an unsigned photocopy of a letter asking for more time - but says he still wants to avoid the delay by getting his agreement enacted as law by Oct. 31.\n\nIf Johnson is defeated on Tuesday, much will depend on how the EU plays yet another Brexit quandary.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said he was discussing the request for a Brexit delay with the leaders of the other 27 member states and would make a decision \"in the coming days\".", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned parliament on Tuesday that if it delayed his Brexit legislation he would abandon his attempt to ratify the deal to leave the European Union and push for an election instead.
