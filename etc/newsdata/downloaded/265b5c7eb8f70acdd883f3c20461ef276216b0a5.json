It's gone!!!\n\nInstead, the duchess is donning a new turquoise bauble in its place.\n\nView photos\n\nMeghan and Harry visited Auwal Mosque (for which she donned a cream-colored headscarf with her army-green maxi dress by American brand Staud) on Heritage Day in Cape Town, South Africa. The mosque is the first and oldest mosque in South Africa and for the Muslim community, and symbolizes the freedom of former slaves to worship.\n\nIn a closer look below, Meghan's Botswana 3-carat diamond engagement ring (and its Princess Diana-collection diamond and pav\u00e9-covered band that she recently added) is nowhere to be found. In its place is a simple gold band with turquoise gemstone nestled next to the Welsh gold wedding band on her finger.\n\nView photos\n\nMeghan's new marquise-cut turquoise ring by Jennifer Meyer retails for $250 but is currently sold out. The duchess may have opted to leave her engagement ring at home due to her desire to be \"low key\" while meeting and greeting the public during their official visits in South Africa, according to a source via Hello! magazine.\n\nTonight, the royal couple will attend a fancy reception at the British High Commissioner's Residence, so perhaps Meghan will don her engagement ring for the more formal occasion?\n\nWith or without the bling, though, she's guaranteed to bring her signature Markle Sparkle. (We're sure of it.)\n\nRELATED: Meghan Markle Wore $6 Borrowed Earrings with a $13,500 Valentino Dress to Misha Nonoo\u2019s Wedding", "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are on day two of their royal tour of Africa, and we noticed something...different...about the Duchess of Sussex.Her engagement ring!
