I watched as my luggage was dragged off the airport\u2019s conveyor belt.\n\nMy friend Melissa\u2019s suitcase had already been lifted on to a metal trestle table, where another guard wearing gloves was opening it.\n\nMelissa didn\u2019t look at me. Both she and I knew only too well what the officers were about to discover: \u00a31.5 million worth of cocaine, hidden in cereal packages among our clothes.\n\nEven though I knew what was in there, I was appalled at how easily they found it. A bikini, a few tops, some shorts\u2026 and more than a dozen sealed packets of narcotics. How could we be so stupid as to think we\u2019d get away with it?\n\nI felt the pinch as handcuffs bit into my wrists, but the physical pain was nothing compared with the shame of being led across Lima airport\u2019s departures hall in front of crowds of people waiting to board their flights. Some were even taking photographs.\n\nMichaella McCollum (left), from County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, was jailed in 2013 after she and Melissa Reid (right) tried to smuggle \u00a31.5million worth of cocaine from Peru into Spain\n\nWe were hustled into a small office where our feet were tied to our chair legs. It was beyond degrading. \u2018What do you think they\u2019re going to do?\u2019 I asked Melissa, who was suddenly looking far from her usual confident self. There was a long silence. \u2018Look,\u2019 she whispered, \u2018we\u2019ll tell them we were forced to do it \u2013 that we didn\u2019t have a choice as we\u2019d been threatened with guns. They can\u2019t keep us if we stick to that.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not sure,\u2019 I whispered back. \u2018How d\u2019you think that\u2019s going to work?\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s all we\u2019ve got,\u2019 she said. \u2018Can you think of anything better?\u2019\n\nWe were interrupted by a uniformed woman coming in followed by two men carrying our luggage. They took photos of us standing beside our cases, then emptied out their contents.\n\n\u2018Melissa Reid. Are these your drugs?\u2019 they asked.\n\n\u2018No.\u2019\n\n\u2018They are in your case.\u2019\n\n\u2018They are not my drugs. I was kidnapped and forced to carry them by a man with a gun. He would have killed me if I didn\u2019t do it.\u2019\n\nThere. Our amended version of the truth was out. Neither of us considered the consequences of what we were saying.\n\nThe woman asked me the same questions. Against my better judgment, I decided to follow Melissa\u2019s lead.\n\nTwo women came running in and started to peel my clothes off. I thought the walk of shame through the departures hall was as low as I could go. Standing there naked in an airport room took the humiliation to new depths.\n\nAll I could think about was my family discovering what had happened. The news would utterly break them.\n\nThe cell doors were solid black metal and very heavy. It took all the guard\u2019s strength to get one of them open. This was the headquarters of the Dirandro \u2013 the narcotics division of the Peruvian National Police. We were ushered inside. The second we were over the threshold, the door clanged shut and we were plunged into darkness.\n\nThrough a small ray of light I could see that the room was tiny, and that there were two cement shelves sticking out of the wall.\n\n\u2018I think those are meant to be beds,\u2019 I said to Melissa. There was no bed linen \u2013 not even a mattress.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long I slept, but I woke up in the pitch black, shivering. As my eyes adjusted, I sensed something ominous \u2013 something that was moving. I could hear them before I saw them: 40 or 50 cockroaches, each one two or three inches long, scurrying above my head and around my feet. I started screaming hysterically.\n\nPolice escort McCollum and Reid in handcuffs as they are moved from the National Police anti-drug headquarters to a court to be formally charged with drug trafficking\n\nThis was just the beginning. How was I going to survive this ordeal?\n\nAt breakfast we joined a queue of unsmiling women.\n\nThey were all holding their own plastic bowls and plates. Melissa and I had nothing.\n\nWhen we got to the front, the guard tried to serve us food. \u2018I need a plate,\u2019 I said, making a shape with my hands.\n\nHe pointed to some stale-looking bread as if to say, \u2018That\u2019s all you\u2019re having, then.\u2019 As I picked up a slice another man appeared with two cups filled with watery porridge. It was the closest thing to hydration we\u2019d get all day.\n\nA fellow prisoner showed us round. The bathroom area was a hole in a grate with a small jug next to it, and a sink. If you wanted a shower you used the jug to pour water over yourself. When you used the hole as a toilet, you used the jug to wash it away.\n\nI tried the tap in the sink but it wasn\u2019t working. Our guide explained that the water was only on for a short period every morning. \u2018What do we drink?\u2019 I asked. She pointed to the jug. \u2018You\u2019re kidding me,\u2019 I said. \u2018We can\u2019t drink that! It\u2019s filthy! And there\u2019s hardly any of it.\u2019 She shrugged.\n\n\u2018Why don\u2019t we have water all day?\u2019 I asked. \u2018Is there a shortage?\u2019\n\nShe shrugged again. \u2018I think they just like to mess with us.\u2019\n\nEverything was so new that my eyes were like saucers. There wasn\u2019t an inch of the squalor I didn\u2019t study.\n\nI noticed a pregnant woman smoking and, when we were out of earshot, I asked our guide where she would have got her cigarette from. \u2018The guards,\u2019 she said. \u2018They make deals.\u2019\n\n\u2018What kind of deals?\u2019 I asked. \u2018I\u2019ve got nothing to trade.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh yes you have,\u2019 she replied. It took a couple of seconds for her meaning to sink in. Then the full horror dawned on me. The guards would provide cigarettes in return for sexual favours.\n\n\u2018Oh, my God! Melissa, are you hearing this?\u2019 I said. \u2018Nothing would surprise me in this place,\u2019 she said.\n\nSunday began like all the other days: a pointless roll call then inedible gruel for breakfast. Around mid-morning I was told a policewoman was waiting to talk to me.\n\n\u2018You have nice hair,\u2019 she said. \u2018Do mine. And, by the way, my name is Maria.\u2019\n\nWhatever I was expecting her to say, it wasn\u2019t that. I could not have been more astonished.\n\nLater, Maria spoke to Melissa and me. \u2018Tomorrow you have your interview, OK?\u2019 she said. We nodded. \u2018Listen,\u2019 she continued, \u2018say \u201cguilty\u201d, OK? This kidnap story\u2026 not good. Police not like this.\u2019\n\nI started to protest, but Melissa dug me in the ribs.\n\nThe guard who escorted us back to our cell said the same thing. \u2018You say \u201cGuilty\u201d or\u2026\u2019 he said, making a cutting motion across his throat. \u2018Everyone guilty who want to live.\u2019\n\nAs I fell asleep that night, their words played over and over in my head. What on earth was I going to do?\n\nWe spent the next day in a state of suspense, waiting to be called. Midday came and went. Nothing, apart from a message saying I had a visitor. I nearly fell over when I saw who it was. In front of me was Keith, my real, flesh-and-blood brother. We held each other for I don\u2019t know how long, sobbing our hearts out. \u2018How is Mum?\u2019 I asked Keith. \u2018Does she hate me?\u2019\n\nOfficers took photos of Michaella (left) and Melissa (right) standing beside their suit cases\n\n\u2018She\u2019s not been well,\u2019 he replied. \u2018She had to go to hospital.\u2019\n\n\u2018No! What\u2019s wrong?\u2019\n\n\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 he repeated, fixing me with his eyes. \u2018You\u2019re asking me that, Michaella? She\u2019s been so sick with worry that she had a mini-stroke.\u2019\n\nI stared at him, processing the words. All the discomfort of the previous days meant nothing compared with the trauma I\u2019d put my adored mum through. What kind of daughter was I? If I could have taken my own life there and then, I\u2019d have done it.\n\nKeith had brought a lawyer from Belfast who sat with us when Melissa and I were finally interviewed. Again, I spouted the same story that we\u2019d rehearsed.\n\n\u2018If you do go to trial, I recommend you plead guilty,\u2019 said the interrogator. \u2018Judges in Peru do not like liars or people who waste their time. If you admit your charges there is a very good chance the judge will be lenient, as it is your first offence.\n\n\u2018But if you try to fight the charges and are then found guilty, which I have to say is a very real possibility, then from my experience you should be prepared to never see daylight again.\u2019\n\nThe reality of our situation began at last to sink in. The interrogator told me it might be a year or more before we had a trial, even if we pleaded guilty. If we claimed our innocence, it could be longer. Guilty or not guilty, what did it matter? Whichever way I looked at it, I wasn\u2019t going home any time soon.\n\nThe question was becoming familiar. \u2018Habla Espa\u00f1ol?\u2019 Do you speak Spanish? We were being given a guided tour round Lima\u2019s Virgen de Fatima prison, home to some of Peru\u2019s most dangerous prisoners, and now ours too \u2013 and we didn\u2019t understand a word of it.\n\n\u2018Mel,\u2019 I said to Melissa, \u2018we really need to learn Spanish.\u2019 We\u2019d by now been told we could be looking at around four years until we got a trial. If we wanted to stay alive in this desperate place we needed to play the game \u2013 and to do that we needed to be able to understand the rules.\n\nMichaella (left) and Melissa (right) sit in a caged dock during their trail at Sarita Colonia prison in Callao, Lima\n\nFour doors led into four cell blocks, which looked packed except one, which judging by the belongings next to the bed, had only one occupant. We learned she was known as \u2018the Diosa del Amor\u2019, or the goddess of love. A few women were playing cards, a couple were reading, but mostly they were doing make-up \u2013 each other\u2019s and their own. The fact they still cared about their appearance gave me hope.\n\nAs we were being shown to our cell one of our fellow inmates rushed up excitedly brandishing a newspaper. \u2018Famosa, muy famosa,\u2019 she said. \u2018You are very famous.\u2019 There on the front page were pictures of Melissa and me, and hundreds of words. And now another visitor had arrived in our cell. Nearly 6ft tall, with a stained vest stretched thinly across a vast chest and belly she looked like a wrestler gone to seed. This was La Diosa \u2013 the woman who lived on her own.\n\nThe giantess was a terrifying sight, with tattoos on every inch of skin, including her face. Dark teardrops ran from under her eyes \u2013 a prison code meaning she\u2019d killed people. On her arms and legs were clear wounds from self-harming and, I guessed, stabbings. She smelled terrible.\n\n\u2018Famosa,\u2019 she repeated, looking from the front-page picture to us and back again.\n\nI was close to retching \u2013 not only from fear, but because of the stench. The woman kissed our pictures on the paper, then waddled out of the room.\n\nAfterwards we heard her story. I wished we hadn\u2019t. Her husband had had an affair and had a baby with his girlfriend. La Diosa had found out, but didn\u2019t say anything to him and carried on as normal.\n\nOne night he came home from work and she fed him a stew, like she often did. But this tasted different. \u2018What meat is this?\u2019 the husband had asked. \u2018Yours,\u2019 she replied. She\u2019d murdered the girlfriend, killed the nine-week-old baby and served it up in a dish.\n\nIf we didn\u2019t feel sick before, we did now. How the hell were we on the same planet as a monster like that, let alone sharing a prison.\n\nIt was in the autumn of 2013 that we heard our case was being fast-tracked. The state prosecutor was prepared to cut a deal. The reason was simple. Our story was bringing a lot of unwelcome attention to Peru\u2019s legal system, and even, potentially, to its thriving tourism industry. From the authorities\u2019 point of view, the sooner the publicity died down the better.\n\nThe deal was that we would plead guilty in exchange for six years and eight months rather than the 15 we could expect to get if we were convicted. There was only one condition. We had to keep it a secret. If one word leaked out, it was off.\n\nWe agreed. It was clear that we had no real choice. Six months after we\u2019d made the worst decision of our lives we became fully-fledged criminals.\n\nI hadn\u2019t expected to spend my 21st birthday in Ancon 2, a fearsome maximum-security facility. It was sometimes hard to see how we would survive a day, let alone several years. And yet I had a strong personal belief that I would be out before the end of my sentence. Even though the rules banned parole for drug traffickers, I felt positive that by working hard and keeping my head down I could turn my situation around.\n\nI grabbed every opportunity I could to prove that I was trustworthy. I took over the running of the prison\u2019s beauty salon, and became a delegada, or representative, for my fellow inmates. Week after week I worked at my Spanish. But there still moments of black despair, especially when I heard that one of my beloved uncles back in Ireland had died.\n\nThe lack of privacy, the constant threat of violence and the sexual harassment from both men and women took their toll.\n\nI\u2019m so grateful for the way things have turned out and I really, really believe everything happens for a reason, writes MICHAELLA MCCOLLUM\n\nMy lucky break finally came in 2015, when I met a man called Fernando who worked at the local courtroom. At least, that was his day job. What he really did was to hire himself out to prisoners who were fed up with waiting for their paperwork.\n\nFor a healthy fee he would grease the appropriate wheels to expedite his clients\u2019 cases. Within seconds of our meeting he had a new customer.\n\nIt was the best money I ever spent. Within a short time my appeal for early release was miraculously fixed for March 29, 2016, a few months hence. Both Fernando and Alberto, a local lawyer who had been working on my case, believed I had a strong chance of success.\n\nAlberto gave me a list of questions he\u2019d heard judges ask so that I could work on my answers in Spanish.\n\nI barely slept on the night of the March 28. The moment had arrived.\n\nAfter some administrative announcements, the court secretary stood up to read out the process of what was going to happen.\n\nA translator began turning the words into English for me, but I announced, as politely as I could, in perfect Spanish, that I understood what was being said. I could see astonished looks passing between the court officials, and even the judge registered mild surprise. I\u2019d certainly got off to a good start.\n\nThe prosecutor began a series of questions. To my relief, all but a couple came from Alberto\u2019s list. What had I done productively with my time in prison? What had I learned about Peruvian values? I put my heart and soul into my answers.\n\nThe judge then asked me about my family \u2013 something I hadn\u2019t mentioned so far because I was worried I\u2019d break down. If I\u2019d ever appeared on Mastermind this would have been my specialist subject. I could list all the ways my behaviour had hurt my mother and siblings and not come up for air.\n\nI spoke for about ten minutes without stopping. The tears arrived around the five-minute mark. The prosecutor appeared unmoved. \u2018Why do you think you\u2019re ready to be reunited with society?\u2019 she continued.\n\n\u2018My family deserves so much better than me,\u2019 I said, \u2018but my mother cannot relax until I\u2019m home.\u2019\n\n\u2018What would it mean to you and your family if you were to leave here today?\u2019 she asked.\n\n\u2018One word,\u2019 I said. \u2018Everything.\u2019\n\nThere was a long silence, and then the judge spoke. \u2018Michaella McCollum,\u2019 she said, \u2018I see no reason why you cannot receive early release. I\u2019m satisfied that you have served your time to the best of your abilities, and have done so with respect for our customs and our laws. You have spent your time wisely, particularly learning the language, and most importantly you have shown remorse and regret. I see you as not being a threat to the Peruvian people and I recommend your early release.\u2019\n\nMichaella's new book, You\u2019ll Never See Daylight Again, is published on Thursday, priced \u00a312.99\n\nFor the first time that day the prosecutor smiled. \u2018Good luck, Michaella,\u2019 she said. \u2018And please look after yourself.\u2019 You know what, I thought. I will. This is a new start. A new beginning. More importantly, it\u2019s the end of the old. My new life started now.\n\nIn February 2017 I was asked if I\u2019d like to write a book about my experiences. It would never have occurred to me, but I was hugely excited by the idea.\n\nI started going back and forth from Northern Ireland to London during that summer, going out and having meetings about the book. Determined to change my life completely, I\u2019d already started studying for A-levels.\n\nAnd then, just as I\u2019d started back at college for my second year, I found out I was pregnant with twins. While I was in London I\u2019d met someone, but we\u2019d hardly got to know each other before I discovered I was having not just one baby but two.\n\nMy beautiful boys, Raphael and Rio, came into the world on May 8, 2018. You think you know what love is, and then you give birth and that surpasses everything you\u2019ve ever felt before.\n\nSomehow, a few weeks later, I took and passed two A-levels \u2013 in psychology and sociology. This summer I added Spanish A-level to my tally.\n\nI\u2019m now weighing up my options. Ultimately, I\u2019d love to live in Spain and bring up my boys away from the sectarian nonsense that still blights people\u2019s lives in Northern Ireland. My dream is one day to do an international business degree in Spanish.\n\nWhen I think of all I\u2019ve been through, even though it was the worst possible thing at the time, it was the making of me. I\u2019ve often wondered, too, what my life would have been like without Melissa. When I needed to cry, she was there. When I felt like I couldn\u2019t do it any more, she picked me up. The thought of doing it all without her is truly scary. It was Melissa who has been such a part of my journey, and who showed me what real friendship is.\n\nI\u2019m so grateful for the way things have turned out and I really, really believe everything happens for a reason. If I hadn\u2019t agreed to write a book, I wouldn\u2019t have been in London; if I hadn\u2019t been in London I wouldn\u2019t have met my babies\u2019 father. Everything is exactly as it should be.\n\n\u00a9 Michaella McCollum, 2019\n\nYou\u2019ll Never See Daylight Again, by Michaella McCollum, is published by John Blake on Thursday, priced \u00a312.99.
