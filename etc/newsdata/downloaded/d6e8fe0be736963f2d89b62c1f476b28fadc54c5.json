But they also added a note of caution that they could not vote for any Brexit deal without seeing a legal text. The 21 former Tory MPs who have recently lost their whip could also rebel.\n\nAn issue over VAT was said by Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, to be a last-minute obstacle in the negotiations when he briefed European ambassadors on Wednesday night. But the British objection was described by EU diplomats as a \u201cBritish smokescreen\u201d to give Downing Street more time to win over the DUP\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster.", "description": "Prime minister is racing to secure backing from Democratic Unionist party for deal, which EU said they could approve today", "authors": ["Kate Lyons", "Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19104f913827182d3517538e34f0b8934d5e7409/0_101_4040_2424/master/4040.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e7f99f87cc6b2f643fe9312671206fec", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
