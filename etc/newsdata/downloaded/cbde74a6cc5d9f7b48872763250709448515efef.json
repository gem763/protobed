It follows the story of the U.S. Marshals' ongoing mission to find Lester Eubanks, a dangerous convict who escaped police custody in 1973 and has never been found.\n\nNew episodes will be available on Wednesdays.

And now, after nearly half a century on the run, a one-time death row inmate named Lester Eubanks is the subject of one of the nation\u2019s most intense manhunts.\n\nU.S. Marshals have made the Eubanks case one of their \"Top 15 Most Wanted,\" commissioning a new age-progression image of the fugitive, and providing unprecedented access to ABC News for a podcast launching Oct. 23, called \"Have You Seen This Man.\"\n\nThe escape was a reckoning for the Ohio prison system, which had tried to institute reforms that would help rehabilitate inmates, but in the process was seeing dangerous convicts get free.\n\nFinding Eubanks has fallen to a special cold case squad from the U.S. Marshals Service. ABC News has spent a year inside the manhunt being led by Deputy Marshal David Siler, one of their most decorated agents, as he tries to use every available tool to find Eubanks before the fugitive's old age catches up to him.\n\nNow, the Marshals are looking to listeners of the ABC News podcast to help deliver the final clue that brings this half-century-old mystery to an end.\n\nEPISODE 1: Outside the half-hour laundromat\n\nMary Ellen Deener was a typical 14-year-old \u2013 news reports described her as a member of her middle school glee club, who loved roller skating, and harbored dreams of being a nun.\n\n\u201cShe just always was giggling,\u201d said her sister, Myrtle Carter. \u201cYou know, a little girl. Always giggling and -- and having fun.\u201d\n\nObtained by ABC News\n\nHer brutal assault and murder in 1965 shook the town of Mansfield, Ohio. Residents were relieved when police delivered swift justice, arresting a troubled 22-year-old local man named Lester Eubanks for the crime. They secured his confession, and gathered persuasive physical evidence, including his footprints at the scene, and the gun he had bought, used in the crime. He was not only convicted, he was sentenced to death.\n\n\u201cIt was like watching a movie -- our movie,\u201d remembered Myrtle Carter, 72, Mary Ellen\u2019s older sister, who still lives in Mansfield. \u201cIt happened that night, by the-- that next afternoon, he was caught. Six months later, he was-- the trial. The sentence. And he was gone.\u201d\n\nAt first, it seemed that this case would end as so many other murder cases do -- with the perpetrator in prison. But that\u2019s not what happened. His bewildering escape and baffling disappearing act are now the focus of the U.S. Marshal Service in Cleveland. The case now rests with its vaunted cold case unit -- a specialized team created by U.S. Marshal Peter Elliott.\n\n\u201cIt didn't feel like these old cases were getting paid attention to. And a lot of these cases, like the Eubanks case, just sat around for years and nothing was happening with them,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cWhat I wanted to do was start a cold case unit and put a person in charge \u2026 who was going to spend 100 percent of his time looking through these cold cases and making a difference.\u201d\n\nThat person is Deputy Marshal David Siler.\n\n\u201cWith these cases, they're extremely difficult,\u201d Siler said. \u201cBut it's something that you can't concentrate on. But hopefully, at the end of the day, a good day for me is hearing those bracelets go around his wrists.\u201d\n\nPlay\n\nEPISODE 2: A trip to the mall\n\nLester Eubanks was headed to prison for the murder of 14-year-old Mary Ellen Deener.\n\nAnd not to just any penitentiary. At the time, Ohio had a reputation for menacing prison complexes, cold places known for violence and cruelty. One prison in the state, the Ohio State Reformatory, even became the set for the movie \u201cShawshank Redemption\u201d (the story itself is set in Maine).\n\nAs a death row inmate at the Ohio State Penitentiary, Eubanks was facing electrocution in a chair with the nickname \u201cOld Sparky.\u201d\n\nObtained by ABC News\n\n\u201cEach and every one would be fearing that day,\u201d said Michael Humphrey, an Ohio inmate during the early 1970s, who now gives tours at the prison that was used as the \u201cShawshank\u201d movie set. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be awful cold hearted not to.\u201d\n\nAt one point, in 1972, Eubanks was just three days away from execution. Then, a series of events broke in Eubanks\u2019s favor. Dale Fortney, a former police officer in Mansfield, Ohio, where Mary Ellen\u2019s murder occurred, said what happened next was \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cLester went from death row, to commuted to a life sentence, to then, a year or two later, now he\u2019s such an honor prisoner that he can be taken unescorted and left in a mall to go Christmas shopping,\u201d Fortney said. \u201cI think normal people can\u2019t comprehend that this could actually happen.\u201d\n\nABC News\n\nFor Deputy U.S. Marshal David Siler, who is now leading the manhunt for Eubanks, understanding the escape was the first step to trying to find him, even if it is 50 years later.\n\n\u201cHe had a plan,\u201d Siler said.\n\nPlay\n\n\"Have You Seen This Man?,\" a new podcast from ABC Audio hosted by \u2018The View's' Sunny Hostin, will chronicle Lester Eubanks' case, including all the latest developments, with a new episode each week.
