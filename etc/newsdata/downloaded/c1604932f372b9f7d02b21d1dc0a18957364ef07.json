Chuck Schumer, prompting Democrats to walk out.\n\n\u201cHe was insulting, particularly to the Speaker, she kept her cool completely but he called her a third-rate politician,\u201d Schumer said to reporters at the White House after they walked out the meeting. \u201cThis was not a dialogue, it was sort of a nasty diatribe not focused on the facts.\u201d\n\nPelosi said that Trump had a \u201cmeltdown,\u201d repeating previous accusations after meeting with the president.\n\n\u201cWhat we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown, sad to say,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also detailed her response to Trump\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I wish you were a politician Mr. President, then you would know the art of the possible,'\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Schumer and Pelosi, Trump also told Democrats that some of the members of ISIS were \u201ccommunists\u201d which \u201cthat might make you happy.\u201d\n\nSchumer said that McConnell told Trump that his decision in Syria was \u201cwrong\u201d and challenged the Senate Majority Leader to bring up the House-passed resolution in the Senate.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham denied parts of Pelosi\u2019s account but described it as predictable.\n\n\u201cWhile Democratic leadership chose to storm out and get in front of the cameras to whine, everyone else in the meeting chose to stay in the room and work on behalf of this country,\u201d she said in a statement, defending Trump as \u201cmeasured, factual and decisive\u201d in the meeting.\n\nGrisham called Pelosi\u2019s decision to walk out of the meeting \u201cbaffling, but not surprising.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe had no intention of listening or contributing to an important meeting on national security issues,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump shared photos of Speaker Pelosi on Twitter, accusing her of having a meltdown.\n\nDo you think they like me? pic.twitter.com/TDmUnJ8HtF \u2014 Donald J.
