The government is expected to try to pass the bill on Tuesday and will only need a simple majority.\n\n\"We will not allow this paralysis to continue and, one way or another, we must proceed straight to an election,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one-line bill to change the date in law for an election can see MPs table motions for amendments to the bill. Amendments could include lowering the voting age to 16 or allowing votes for EU citizens living in the U.K.\n\nBoth the Scottish National Party and Liberal Democrats said over the weekend they would back a Dec. 9 election.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg told the House of Commons that legislation to enact the Brexit deal has been put on hold pending an election.\n\nBritain voted to leave the European Union over three years ago and it is still unclear on what terms it will leave the bloc. Some MPs view an election as the only way to break the Brexit impasse.\n\nAt 11:50 GMT was flat at 1.2866, while was down 0.12% to 0.8615.", "description": "NewsBreak: U.K. Opposition Labour Party to Back December General Election", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPECA40N0_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
