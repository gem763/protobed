The victory clinched a postseason berth because, while Washington rallied, the Pittsburgh Pirates improbably did, too; the Pirates snapped a nine-game losing streak by beating the Chicago Cubs, 9-2.\n\nThe Nationals will play in the wild-card game on the first day of October. That fact, for a moment, overwhelmed everything. Scherzer, in the clubhouse after the game, snapped on swimming goggles and sprayed everyone in sight with a bottle of Campo Viejo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a good freakin\u2019 team. And we can play with anybody in this league.\u201d\n\nThen, slowly, the situation came back into focus. The Milwaukee Brewers are one step away from securing their spot as the wild-card opponent. Two serious questions remain: Will the game be in Milwaukee or Washington? And will Scherzer start?\n\nThe former is tough to say with five games left and the Nationals leading the Brewers by one game. The latter seemed clear Tuesday when Martinez intimated yes.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the schedule right now, that\u2019s Max\u2019s day,\u201d the manager said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s one of the best.\u201d\n\nBoswell: The Nats earned their spot in the postseason, but they still have unfinished business\n\nYet the 35-year-old\u2019s hiccups raised doubts because the other candidate, Stephen Strasburg, is as durable and dominant as ever. Strasburg is scheduled to start Thursday, putting him on regular rest for next Tuesday while Scherzer is lined up to pitch Sunday and could if Game 162 decides home field. Strasburg\u2019s track record in the postseason \u2014 one earned run in 19 innings across three starts \u2014 bests Scherzer\u2019s (a 3.73 ERA in 16 appearances).\n\nScherzer\u2019s results Tuesday \u2014 four runs on five hits in six innings \u2014 were more concerning because he seemed in prime position to dominate. The Phillies\u2019 starting lineup was without their three best hitters: Bryce Harper, J.T. Realmuto and Rhys Hoskins.\n\nThings went wrong right away. Scherzer walked the second hitter, and the third reached on an infield hit before Miller crushed a 425-foot shot to center. The infamously fiery starter betrayed no more frustration than stalking around the mound.\n\nPerhaps the most frustrating part for Scherzer was that his stuff still seemed strong. He tallied 10 strikeouts \u2014 his 11th double-digit total of the season \u2014 before departing. He proved it right away, too, escaping the first by striking out both batters after Miller, the first on a slider and the second on a change-up. He insisted he felt good and said that, even compared with his previous start against the St. Louis Cardinals, he felt stronger after 90 pitches.\n\n\u201cI feel sharp,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m really built for 100 pitches right now. I feel like I\u2019m still \u00adexecuting better than ever.\u201d\n\nGame 1: Nats eliminate Phillies from playoff contention, move closer to clinching spot of their own\n\nScherzer retired the next six hitters \u2014 including three on strikeouts. Then he ran into Miller again. The 29-year-old journeyman entered Tuesday a career .239 hitter with 83 homers in \u00adseven seasons. He had found some success against Scherzer before \u2014 he was 3 for 7 with a homer and a double coming into the game \u2014 but what he did next seemed improbable at best: Miller rocked a Scherzer two-seamer deep to right field for a solo shot.\n\nThe starter exited after 101 pitches, but reliever Daniel Hudson said he was convinced Scherzer would\u2019ve pitched the seventh had his spot in the order not come up.\n\n\u201cI feel really good about going forward in the playoffs,\u201d Scherzer said.\n\nNot everyone else can say the same. It didn\u2019t matter that Scherzer retired nine of his last 11 hitters. It didn\u2019t matter for the night\u2019s final score. It didn\u2019t matter that no one else generated solid contact the way Miller had. Those two mistakes still meant Scherzer left the mound with more questions than answers.", "description": "Scherzer is lined up to pitch in the National League wild-card game, but he hasn\u2019t looked like his dominant self recently.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Cy62LwwOrAROHQktch72H3yfH9Q=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QMK5WEG7HUI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
