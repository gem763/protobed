They were phenomenal.\"\n\nIn researching her feature on Pratt for AFR Magazine, senior writer Jemima Whyte had heard that Pratt's son Leon recently asked to attend a Visy board meeting for this ninth birthday. That led to her focusing on what Anthony had learnt about business from his late father Richard, and what he was, in turn, teaching his children.\n\nAnthony Pratt, happily obliging our photographer's request to make a delivery on his Bombardier. Alina Gozin'a\n\nWhen the Pratt family politely declined the request to photograph Anthony with his children, AFR Magazine's creative team turned to iconic shots of jets for inspiration. Pratt obliged to the request to pose with his Bombadier Global Express and had envisaged a quick photo shoot that would show off the tail of his jet, which features the logo of his US box manufacturer, Pratt Industries.\n\nUnfortunately magazine covers are rarely simple.\n\nThe day before the shoot Gozin'a spent four hours at Melbourne's Essendon airport testing the light, angles and different camera lenses to create the exact effect she was after. As requested, staff at one of Pratt's factories provided pallets of boxes, a forklift and a choice of drivers while Gozin'a brought in two assistants, a smoke machine, screens, tripods and cameras.", "description": "Cover shoots are never easy.
