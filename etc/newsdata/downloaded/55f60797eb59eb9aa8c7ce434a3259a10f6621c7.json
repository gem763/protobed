Trump broke the minds of liberal America. You see that with the ongoing myth peddling concerning Russian collusion. You see that with the overreaction to everything this man does; Trump could pet a golden retriever and allegations of whether he abused the dog might pop up on networks likes MSNBC. Trump has sent the Left into meltdown mode for the past three years. It\u2019s delicious to watch. Yet, there\u2019s another organization that has also done this: the National Rifle Association. We all knew liberals vilified one of the nation\u2019s oldest civil rights organizations, but it\u2019s taken a whole new turn when an elected body\u2014the San Francisco Board of Supervisors\u2014labels them a domestic terrorist organization. A third of Democratic voters agreed, according to a Rasmussen poll. That\u2019s not shocking. What\u2019s insane is that 28 percent think it should be against the law to join the NRA. To boot, 15 percent of Republicans agree. Who are those people? (via Rasmussen):\n\nFollowing several recent mass shootings, officials in San Francisco declared the NRA a domestic terrorist organization. The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that nearly one-out-of-three Likely Democratic Voters (32%) favor declaring the gun rights group a terrorist organization in the community where they live. Fourteen percent (14%) of Republicans and 20% of voters not affiliated with either major party agree. Twenty-eight percent (28%) of Democrats say Americans should be prohibited by law from belonging to pro-gun rights organizations like the NRA, a view shared by 15% of Republicans and 10% of uanffiliateds. Among all likely voters, 23% favor declaring the NRA a terrorist organization in their home community, while 18% think it should be against the law to belong to pro-gun rights groups like the NRA.\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat predictable. Liberals are all for freedom of choice, except when it comes to how you defend yourself. They\u2019re all for freedom of speech and association, except when they\u2019re not. You can only join a pre-approved list of organizations they deem worthy and you can only say what is considered non-problematic in their speech codes. Facts be damned. This is illiberal. This is extreme. And it showcases the Left\u2019s five-year sprint to the far left of the political spectrum. It\u2019s now full-blown crazy town. That can be the only explanation as to why a healthy amount of Democrats think it should be illegal to join a civil rights organization.", "description": ".09/12/2019 19:35:08PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/71/5a51771e-17fe-497a-8d50-df5d97d5e8b2.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
