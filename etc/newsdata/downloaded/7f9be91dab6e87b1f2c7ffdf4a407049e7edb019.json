(Emily Latimer/CBC)\n\nFive years ago, Isadore travelled to Saskatchewan to compete in track and field.\n\n\"That's really what got me here,\" he said. \"It's what I was interested in because I had a chance to travel if I joined a sport.\"\n\nSince then, he's competed in track events across Canada.\n\n\"It's been nice,\" he said. \"It's the only time I got to travel. I've been to Toronto, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.\"\n\nHe trains at the local gym in the Wagmatcook Culture Centre. He works out five to six times per week without a coach or trainer, but his friends motivate him on the sidelines.\n\nA multi-sport athlete, he plays hockey in the fall and winter, track and field in the spring and softball in the summer.\n\nIsadore competes in long jump at the 2019 Atlantic Indigenous Games in Halifax.
