Just a whirlwind of emotions going back and forth.\u201d\n\nLike the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not how you draw it up,\u201d Bears QB Mitchell Trubisky said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos, who are off to their first 0-2 start since 1999, thought they\u2019d survived and that time had expired when cornerback Chris Harris Jr. tackled Allen Robinson after he hauled in a 25-yard pass on fourth-and-15 from Trubisky at the Denver 35.\n\nThe clock showed all zeroes and both teams milled around on the field not knowing whether to celebrate a win or lament a loss. Then referee Adrian Hill announced there was 1 second remaining and Chicago was using its last timeout.\n\nPineiro\u2019s third field goal, a day after his 24th birthday, sent the Bears (1-1) streaming back onto the field in celebration of a victory that seemed so unlikely after they\u2019d surrendered the lead moments earlier.\n\n\u201cI knew deep down in my heart that it was going in,\u201d Khalil Mack said. \u201cYou put that pressure on that guy, Eddy P., the birthday man. He came out and nailed it. That\u2019s how you want to play ball. Kudos to everyone else sticking in there and believing. I\u2019m glad to get the win and get the hell up out of here.\u201d\n\nIn a whipsaw of emotion, cornerback Kyle Fuller, whose goal-line interception with five minutes left seemingly sealed Chicago\u2019s win, surrendered a 7-yard tiptoe TD to Emmanuel Sanders . Sanders barely got both feet toes down in the right corner of the end zone.\n\nThat made it 13-12, and the Broncos lined up for 2. A delay pushed them back 5 yards and Fangio sent Brandon McManus out instead for the extra point from the 20-yard line and the tie. But McManus was wide right and the Bears went wild.\n\nHold on: a flag on Chicago.\n\nBuster Skrine was offside and the Broncos moved up to the 1. Out came their offense again, and with an empty backfield, Joe Flacco backpedaled and hit Sanders at the goal line in front of Fuller to give Denver a 14-13 lead.\n\nFor the second straight game, the Broncos failed to get a sack, but linebacker Bradley Chubb came close, hitting Trubisky just as he got off a throw to tight end Trey Burton for 10 yards. A debatable roughing call on Chubb tacked on 15 yards and the Bears were suddenly in business at the Broncos 45.\n\n\u201cWe had our chances to win there,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cObviously, the critical penalty at the end of the game there, the roughing call was huge because it stops the clock, saves their timeout and gives them 15 yards.\u201d\n\nThree incompletions were followed by a 12-men-in-the-huddle infraction, however, and the Bears were facing fourth-and-15 from their 40 with 9 seconds remaining.\n\nTrubisky stepped up and found Robinson over the middle in the nick of time. Harris\u2019 tackle came 1 second too early for the Broncos, who saw their 13 home game September winning streak snapped.\n\n\u201cTough call, tough game,\u201d said Von Miller, who remains stuck on 98 career sacks.\n\nPAY DIRT\n\nChicago finally reached the end zone - by the nose of the football - with 1:14 left in the third quarter when running back David Montgomery scored from a yard out on the Bears\u2019 sixth snap from inside the 5 and fifth straight from the 1 or 2. That put them ahead 13-3.\n\nHOLD ON\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to turn this around,\u201d promised Broncos left tackle Garett Bolles , the team\u2019s top draft pick in 2017, who was whistled for holding a career-worst four times.\n\nThat gave him an NFL-high 34 flags in 34 career starts.\n\n\u201cGarett\u2019s going to learn from this game,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cThey have some good players, and he\u2019s going to learn from it. But he\u2019s our left tackle and he\u2019s going to be our left tackle - and he needs to play without holding.\u201d\n\nBolles had 10 holding calls his rookie season, nine last year and already five this season, when he seems to have actually regressed under Hall of Famer Mike Munchak.\n\nHOMECOMING KING\n\nBears linebacker Danny Trevathan, who won a Super Bowl ring in Denver, had a dozen tackles in his homecoming.\n\nINJURIES:\n\nBears starting DT Bilal Nichols was knocked out with a hand injury in the third quarter. \u2026 Broncos starters ILB Todd Davis (calf) and CB Bryce Callahan (foot) were held out for the second straight week.\n\nNEXT UP:\n\nChicago: visits Washington on Sept. 23.\n\nDenver: visits Green Bay on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Eddy Pineiro won Chicago's nerve-wracking kicking competition.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/bears_broncos_football_82490_c0-137-3267-2041_s1770x1032.jpg?5c47a96450fa6c0340dab615d67a3de4fc0613ef", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
