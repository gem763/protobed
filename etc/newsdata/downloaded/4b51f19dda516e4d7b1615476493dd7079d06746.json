Giuliani \u2014 individuals who helped or were privy to efforts to influence Ukrainian leaders to conduct investigations that could damage Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nAD\n\nThus far, they have deposed only Trump\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who resigned his post late last month and then provided the committees with copies of text messages he exchanged with other diplomats, Giuliani and a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nAD\n\nThose messages revealed an apparent effort to encourage the Ukrainians to investigate the 2016 U.S. election, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president.\n\nYovanovitch, a career diplomat with three decades of experience, was ambassador to Ukraine until she was recalled in May after coming under attack from conservative media figures who alleged she was biased against Trump. State Department officials have said the accusations are baseless.\n\nAD\n\nLawmakers are expected to ask Yovanovitch about her interactions with Giuliani, Trump, and others pertaining to the investigations they sought.\n\nGiuliani has embraced some of the unproven accusations against Yovanovitch, including a theory that she played a role in a conspiracy orchestrated by liberal philanthropist George Soros to expose former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u2019s Ukraine-related corruption. The president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. referred to her on Twitter as a \u201cjoker.\u201d And the president himself suggested she was biased against him, telling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky she was \u201cbad news,\u201d according to a White House summary of their July 25 phone call in which Trump sought to enlist Zelensky\u2019s help looking into the Bidens.\n\nAD\n\nFor many U.S. diplomats, she has become a symbol of the political pressures being applied to apolitical professionals working for the State Department. According to people familiar with negotiations, Yovanovitch has been quite willing to testify about her experience \u2014 but if the State Department objects before Friday, she may have to do so under subpoena.\n\nAD\n\nFollowing stints as the U.S. ambassador in Armenia and Kyrgyzstan, Yovanovitch was posted to Ukraine at the end of the Obama administration and focused on urging Ukraine to tackle its endemic corruption.\n\nYovanovitch was recalled from Kiev two months early from her three-year posting. She remains on the State Department payroll, working as a fellow at Georgetown University.\n\nHer recall rankled many of her colleagues, who are disappointed that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not do more to shield the veteran diplomat from false insinuations that led to political pressure from the White House.\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this year, conservative media outlets attacked Yovanovitch and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine, accusing them of trying to protect the Bidens from an investigation by Ukrainian prosecutors.\n\nKent was scheduled to appear before the House committees on Monday, but the deposition never took place. To date, lawmakers have not announced they will subpoena Kent, nor have they added any of the State Department employees who appeared in Volker\u2019s texts \u2014 such as Ukraine embassy charges d\u2019affaires William Taylor \u2014 to the public roster of individuals they intend to depose.\n\nAD", "description": "Marie Yovanovitch was recalled by the Trump administration amid accusations she was biased against the president.", "authors": ["Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Carol Morello", "National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy", "State Department"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZKTVCGSJVXkbKimFMweYaqKA-x8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FSRLBTXLBAI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
