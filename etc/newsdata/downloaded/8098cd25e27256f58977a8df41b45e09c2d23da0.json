Subscribe here to get the G-File delivered to your inbox on Fridays.\n\nDear Readers (and all the ships at sea),\n\nIt\u2019s a cold and rainy morning here in Charleston, S.C. I\u2019m in my tenebrous hotel room awaiting dawn, or at least the gloaming of false dawn and the promise of coffee it will bring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t mean to sound gloomy. I\u2019m actually quite chipper. But that\u2019s because I\u2019m spending the weekend with the Fair Jessica eating Charleston\u2019s finest fare \u2014 so what is there to complain about? Last night, I had fried chicken skins and pimiento cheese, while drinking a martini at Husk. How bad could life be?\n\nIn that sense, I feel a bit like that stock character in Godzilla and various disaster movies who\u2019s oblivious to the calamities around him. I\u2019m not quite like Walter Matthau in Earthquake \u2014 so drunk he doesn\u2019t notice the world falling down around him \u2014 but hey, the day is young.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m Not Your Strawman, Buttercup\n\nI bring this up for a couple reasons. First, because every day, as I inchworm-spelunk through my Twitter mentions like Andy Dufresne leaving Shawshank prison, I hear from people \u2014 and algorithms pretending to be people \u2014 about how miserable, sad, regretful, and \u201cbutthurt\u201d I am for this, that, or the other thing going on in Washington.\n\nFor years, this kind of thing came at me overwhelmingly from the Left. These days it comes at me mostly from \u201cthe Right\u201d or, to be more specific, from the MAGA/Bannon swamps. And it\u2019s just weird to me. Sure, I have my good days and bad, like everyone else. You know, like when you wake up in the camping section of a Walmart in a strange town, covered in blood not your own (\u201cYou didn\u2019t specify whether that\u2019s a good day or a bad one.\u201d \u2014 The Couch).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy point is that politics isn\u2019t life \u2014 or, at least, it shouldn\u2019t be. I used to think when I got this kind of grief from the Left that it was evidence that the progressives take politics way too seriously. If you\u2019re heartbroken whenever your \u201cteam\u201d loses, then your \u201cenemies\u201d must feel the same way when they lose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s a kind of projection \u2014 the assumption that someone else\u2019s emotional state mirrors your own. This dynamic doesn\u2019t quite fit the textbook definition of projection because, at least as I understand it, Freud thought projection was a kind of denial. A bigot accuses others of being the real bigots to conceal his own bigotry, or something like that.\n\nThe difference with so many of the people I hear from is that they aren\u2019t denying anything. Because they think politics is everything, they assume I must think so, too. I don\u2019t. The whole point of being a conservative and \u2014 I would argue \u2014 an American is to see politics as only a fraction of one\u2019s life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust Say No to One-Thingism\n\nWhich brings me to the second reason. In this week\u2019s Remnant podcast, I had a wide-ranging conversation with one of my favorite people, Steve Hayward. At the very end, we started giving advice to youngn\u2019s just starting their careers. We even raised the idea of doing a whole show on life advice for young politicos, or young conservatives, or carbon-based life forms (we didn\u2019t really nail it down). But the subject has been on my mind a bit since we recorded the podcast.\n\nSo, as I prepare to enjoy a vacation weekend away from politics, here\u2019s some advice: Don\u2019t invest that much of your soul in politics. In fact, don\u2019t invest your whole soul in anything.\n\nNow, if you want to be an Olympic wrestler or the world\u2019s best competitive eater, this isn\u2019t necessarily great advice. But if you want to be a happy and relatively successful person over the course of your whole life, you need to diversify your portfolio. A few years ago, I wrote about this at length in a G-File titled \u201cLove Isn\u2019t All You Need\u201d (back when it only came out in email, so no link, alas). In it, I railed against \u201cone-thingism\u201d \u2014 the idea, promulgated by Curly in City Slickers, that you should find that one thing in life and dedicate yourself to it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is horrible, terrible, no-good advice. Just because it comes from Curly doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not the philosophy of zealots, stalkers, radicals, terrorists, and extremists of all stripes.\n\nPut aside the complicated question of religion for a moment. No thing in your life should be your everything: no cause, no business, no movement, no institution. Likewise, you shouldn\u2019t make any person your only reason to get out of bed in the morning. You won\u2019t be doing your child or spouse any favors if you do that. Indeed, your smothering will likely lead to a maladjusted kid or a spouse who loses respect for you or perhaps seeks a restraining order. Unwavering love is great. Unwavering attention or obsession: terrible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe simple fact is that in this fallen and flawed world, putting all of your chips on a single thing or person is an invitation for massive disappointment or, simply, a wasted life. First of all, when you give all of your soul to something, it can become a kind of enslavement. You forfeit your own agency, and your loyalty is no longer seen as something that the object of your love needs to earn. For Luca Brasi, the Corleone family is his One Thing, and that makes him a golem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you think X is already deserving of your whole soul, it becomes difficult to imagine being outside X. And, as a result, you lose the critical distance necessary to offer constructive criticism. This is why too much devotion is destructive in politics and society generally. Instead of being a force for improvement, you\u2019re taken for granted as a loyal foot soldier, booster, or cheerleader. For the one-thingist \u2014 the Communist, Fascist, Jihadist, or, less dramatically, the college-football booster, the crazy fanboy, or some other tribalist thinker \u2014 if the object of your devotion can do no wrong, then you will never be an advocate for improvement, you\u2019ll be a reliable apologist for the worst actions of your cause.\n\nIt is a hallmark of a modern and free society that you can divide up your loyalties and passions. It\u2019s only when you\u2019re in a life-or-death struggle that one-thingism makes any sense. In a zombie apocalypse, keeping your children or spouse alive is an acceptable One Thing. In a totalitarian regime, revolution could be an acceptable One Thing. But in a free and prosperous society, the route to real meaning and happiness is Many Things.\n\nIn a free and prosperous society, the route to real meaning and happiness is Many Things.\n\nEven in religion, I think one-thingism is best avoided. I know Abraham was asked to put God before his own child, but that didn\u2019t mean Abraham didn\u2019t love Isaac. One of Christianity\u2019s greatest contributions to Western civilization was to create the space for multiple loyalties. Jesus says we must render unto Caesar \u2014 but only what is Caesar\u2019s. St. Augustine divides the world into the City of Man and the City of God \u2014 a division that wasn\u2019t geographic but spiritual and psychological. Protestantism accelerated this trend in countless ways (wait for my book).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a matter of a life well-lived, I think it\u2019s admirable and good to be informed by your faith in all of your endeavors. But some endeavors needn\u2019t be seen through the prism of religious one-thingism. The man of God and the atheist alike can love college football or be comrades on a bowling team.\n\nMore Eggs, Different Baskets\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a clich\u00e9 to say that nobody ever said on their deathbed, \u201cI wish I spent more time at the office\u201d or, \u201cI spent too much time with my kids.\u201d And that\u2019s good advice. If you\u2019re organizing your life around how you want to be remembered when you die, you should think more about your eulogy than your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I\u2019ve been to memorial services where speakers share stories about a great career, but share little to nothing about being a great father, mother, wife, husband, or friend. I find it heartbreaking.\n\nBut the key to a rich and healthy life is not putting all your eggs in a single basket. Find the two, three, or five baskets that give you meaning and hold them tight. But give new baskets a try from time to time.\n\nAs a gross generalization, I think women understand this better than men. In part because even successful professional women tend to be the primary parent for their kids, women understand intimately the tradeoffs between competing devotions. In my experience, women have more hobbies than men, too. And they\u2019re better at engaging in civil society, from school fundraisers to neighborhood associations to informal groups of friends. Men, particularly successful ones, are more likely to throw themselves into their work to the exclusion of other important things. Then, six months after retirement, they discover that playing golf all the time is boring, and they get miserable or sick or drunk or bat-guano crazy about politics.\n\nYou Asked for This\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of bat-guano crazy politics, let me change gears. Last year, Kevin Williamson wrote a post in the Corner titled \u201cRemember, You Asked for This.\u201d It was about the decision to nominate Donald Trump.\n\nWell, I want to offer something similar. Right now, it looks like Roy Moore will be elected the next senator from Alabama. Because Donald Trump endorsed him, the Republican National Committee is once again helping to fund Moore\u2019s campaign, and Steve Bannon is praising him as a man of great integrity while denigrating Mitt Romney, a mensch who flushes more integrity down the toilet every morning than Bannon has displayed since becoming a blood-and-soil Jeremiah.\n\nYou can forget the sexual allegations against Moore \u2014 though you can be sure no one else will, because the Democrats and the media will be reminding voters about it constantly. Forget the fact that Moore is a grifter and huckster who claims America is evil and had 9/11 coming but that we were great when slavery was legal. Put aside all the arguments about how \u201cwe\u201d need his vote or that Republicans shouldn\u2019t unilaterally disarm.\n\nThe simple fact is this guy, if elected, will be a disaster for Trump, conservatives, and the GOP alike \u2014 even if he votes in partisan lockstep with the Trump agenda. The mere act of him voting for good legislation will make it harder for some senators to vote for it. Moore will say stupid, offensive, and bigoted things \u2014 and every Republican, starting with Trump himself, will be asked to respond.\n\nThe simple fact is this guy, if elected, will be a disaster for Trump, conservatives, and the GOP alike\n\nMoore voters in Alabama, of course, will deserve much of the blame, but so will a large coalition of national Republicans \u2014 starting with Donald Trump \u2014 as well as cable-news and talk-radio boosters and rationalizers, and of course Bannon himself, who let this world-historic cock-up happen based on a potted theory that Mitch McConnell is an enemy or that you can build a \u201cnationalist\u201d movement around a credibly accused child molester and theocratic bigot and constitutional illiterate.\n\nIn short, you asked for this. You know who you are, and if you don\u2019t, you should prepare to be reminded in the months to come.\n\nVarious & Sundry\n\nAnd now for some prideful begging.\n\nI say prideful because \u201cshameless\u201d doesn\u2019t cover it. I\u2019m outright proud to ask for your help. As I wrote above, I don\u2019t think you should give everything of yourself to anything. But you should do what you can, where you can, and when you can for the institutions in your life that matter. You\u2019ll almost always get more out than you put in. That\u2019s certainly true for me. One of the things that I\u2019ve given a huge chunk of myself to for almost 20 years has been National Review, and I\u2019m the better man for it.\n\nOver that time, some things have changed in NR World. My job titles have changed (I\u2019m a senior editor now), but I\u2019m also a fellow of the National Review Institute, which has become the umbrella organization of the whole National Review enterprise or, better yet, the National Review mission.\n\nBill Buckley himself always said that the mission comes before the magazine \u2014 but that the magazine was the best, but not the only, way to carry it out. That\u2019s why he founded National Review Institute to support the mission. NRI sponsors conferences, speeches, and educational programs around the country, hosted by National Review writers, editors, and contributors. (If you must know, most of my salary now comes from the Institute. Lowry mostly pays me in chickens.) Without NRI, I couldn\u2019t have finished my book. NRI fellow Kevin Williamson runs a journalism program. NRI drops David French behind enemy lines on one campus after another to fight for free speech.\n\nWe are trying to raise $250,000 for NRI. That\u2019s a big lift. The good news is your contribution to NRI is tax deductible. The great news is that it literally makes everything we do either easier, better, or just plain possible. I know there are differences of opinion about the current political situation among longtime friends. But if your concern is the long game \u2014 for the country or the conservative cause \u2014 supporting what we do is imperative.\n\nAgain, because most people have lots of things going on in their lives \u2014 work, family, friends, faith, hobbies, etc. \u2014 not everyone can give as much of themselves to the conservative cause as we do here. But the only reason we can do as much as we do is because of you and people like you. We live every day knowing that we are indebted not just to Bill Buckley but to the numerous people who give what they can to keep the mission alive.

The problem is that whenever they see one of the humans take out luggage, they know something bad is going to happen (though when we surprise them and invite them on a road trip, it\u2019s pretty awesome). This week, there was a lot of that. I went to NYC, came home, packed again, and went to Charleston. Yesterday morning, The Fair Jessica packed, too. Anyway, it makes them very mopey and needy. Still, when I came home yesterday, I got some good wiggle-greetings (watch to the end to see how Pippa presses her agenda pretty quickly). Anyway, they\u2019re in good hands with Kirsten, our loyal dogwalker, and having much fun, which alleviates a lot of the guilt.
