(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nPresident Trump alleged Wednesday that Hunter Biden got China to put $1.5 billion in a fund, an assertion that has been flatly denied by Biden\u2019s lawyer, who said earlier this year that his client had not received anything from the investment.\n\nTrump, who has made a similar allegation for months, is referencing information from a book by Peter Schweizer, \u201cSecret Empires,\u201d that first detailed how Hunter Biden flew to China on Air Force Two with his father in 2013.\n\nHis father, former vice president Joe Biden, had traveled to China at the time to meet with that country\u2019s leaders while he was still in office. Schweizer wrote in a summary of the 2018 book that 10 days after the Bidens arrived in China, \u201cHunter Biden\u2019s firm scored a $1.5 billion deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government\u2019s Bank of China.\u201d\n\nTrump on Wednesday put it this way: \u201cWhen Biden\u2019s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund and the biggest funds in the world can\u2019t get money out of China and he\u2019s there with one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two. I think that\u2019s a horrible thing. I think it\u2019s a horrible thing.\u201d\n\nTrump made his comments on the day that the White House released a transcript of his conversation in which he urged the president of Ukraine to look into Hunter Biden\u2019s work as a board member of a gas company in that country, a job that was given when Joe Biden was vice president and dealing with Ukraine policy.\n\nHouse Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, while Trump has tried to keep the focus on what he calls corrupt acts by the Bidens.\n\nIn bringing up the China episode, Trump did not provide any new evidence to back up his claims.\n\nHunter Biden did travel with his father on Air Force Two to China on Dec. 4, 2013.\n\nTwelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a just-formed investment advisory firm, known as BHR, whose partners included Chinese entities. Affiliates of the advisory firm said they planned to raise $1.5 billion.\n\nSome media reports over the past five years have described Hunter Biden as an owner of a private equity company that sought to raise that amount.\n\nHowever, George Mesires, lawyer for Hunter Biden, said in an interview earlier this year that his client\u2019s role has been misconstrued. He said Hunter Biden was on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.\n\nMoreover, Mesires said, it was not until October 2017 that Hunter Biden acquired a financial stake in BHR. Hunter Biden bought a 10 percent equity interest that was worth $430,000 in July, Mesires said. At least half of the firm\u2019s stake is owned by Chinese entities, according to business records.\n\nMesires, asked about the matter in July, said: \u201cTo date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors. The characterization of Mr. Biden as owning a $1.5 billion private equity firm funded by the Chinese seriously misconstrues Mr. Biden\u2019s role with BHR.\u201d\n\nMesires did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.", "description": "Former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son owns a 10 percent stake in a firm but \u201chas not received any return,\u201d said Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer.", "authors": ["Michael Kranish", "National Political Investigative Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/50SjuAfoj277bGa8GGu3-VCInN4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HVBTCRW74II6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
