Though the experience deeply affected her, she explained that she never told her parents for a reason that may sound familiar to many from immigrant families.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this weird thing that happens with kids of immigrants,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIn a strange way, sometimes you feel like you have to protect them from the things that they don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nWu explained on the show that a teacher believed she had copied the paper, telling her that she \u201cwas not good enough to have written this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d the actor said.\n\nThe instructor then looked up all of Wu\u2019s sources and later brought the student up to her other teachers to question whether they felt her capable of producing such writing. The only teacher who said, with conviction, that Wu was \u201cgood enough\u201d to have written the paper was her drama teacher.\n\nWu added that she wasn\u2019t going to risk putting her parents in a situation where they\u2019d be treated poorly as well.\n\n\u201cMy parents, while they are very educated ... his spoken accent is very strong and he has a softer voice. ... this woman is already thinking that I\u2019m dumb and I\u2019m not good enough. I\u2019m not going to let her think that about my parents just because they talk differently,\u201d she said.\n\nWu noted that, even early on, she understood why people would treat her parents differently, despite their mastery of the English language and their education. In the U.S., she said, \u201cyou think that your baseline is the baseline from which anybody else is a deviation and is like absurd and weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to get out of the box of saying, like, there is one normative standard, and you have to just open your mind to just thinking that, even though you physically are the center of your experience, that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t other experiences that don\u2019t center you.\u201d", "description": "\"Sometimes you feel like you have to protect them from the things that they don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said of immigrant parents.", "authors": ["Asian-American Affairs Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d70704f25000055000479ff.png?cache=2nfh3xohkc&ops=1778_1000"}
