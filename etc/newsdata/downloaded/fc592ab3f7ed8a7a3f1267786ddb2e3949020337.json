The planned offensive has presented the Trump administration with a dilemma, because the Syrian-Kurdish fighters are U.S. allies who aided in the fight against the Islamic State militant group.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe White House announced Sunday that it was withdrawing U.S. troops from the area that Turkey planned to invade, igniting a firestorm of criticism. Republican leaders denounced Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds. Pentagon officials struggled with explanations, humanitarian workers warned of civilian casualties, and Kurdish commanders said they might be forced to abandon their Syrian prisons holding thousands of captured Islamic State fighters and head for the front lines against Turkey.\n\nTurkey views the Syrian-Kurdish fighters as terrorists allied with Turkey\u2019s Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK. A spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Fahrettin Altun, writing in The Washington Post on Wednesday, called for international support for Turkey\u2019s offensive.\n\n\u201cTurkey has no ambition in northeastern Syria except to neutralize a long-standing threat against Turkish citizens and to liberate the local population from the yoke of armed thugs,\u201d Altun wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nU.S. officials said Tuesday that the offensive could begin within hours. On Wednesday morning, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said preparations for the offensive were continuing. The Reuters news agency, citing Turkish officials, reported Wednesday afternoon that a portion of a concrete border wall had been removed in advance of the military action.\n\nOfficials said they were uncertain whether Turkish forces would conduct a symbolic feint inside the border \u2014 which they said could enable the U.S. troops to return to reactivate the safe zone \u2014 or would force their way deeper into Syria.\n\nOutside experts have cautioned that a large-scale Turkish operation, if it precipitated a security breakdown at prisons holding Islamic State militants, could prompt a larger U.S. withdrawal from Syria. The American presence, which includes about 1,000 troops in northeastern Syria, is a lean force dispersed across a number of bases.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSabah, a Turkish newspaper close to Erdogan\u2019s government, published a report Tuesday describing how the battle might unfold. It said Turkish armed forces would wait for the full withdrawal of U.S. troops before commencing any operation. Warplanes and howitzers would pound enemy positions, then Turkish troops would enter Syria from several points along the border, east of the Euphrates River.\n\nThe military would advance as far as 18 miles into Syrian territory, the report said, without naming its source. After the operation was completed, Turkey would \u201ccontinue its humanitarian work to bring back locals in the area.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the Turkish border on Wednesday, many residents were steeling themselves for the worst. Mikael Mohammed, a Kurdish father of three who owns a clothing store in Tel Abyad, a quarter-mile from the Turkish frontier, said he had not received any customers since Tuesday. U.S. troops based in the town withdrew early Monday after the White House announcement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAll the shops around me are open, except that there are no people,\u201d Mohammed said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe only people heading to the marketplace today are those who need to buy food or things that are absolutely necessary. People who are out there in the streets look as if they are going to someone\u2019s funeral.\u201d\n\nAnd the town itself was divided. Some residents supported the Syrian-Kurdish force, called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as it faced off against Turkey\u2019s military might. Others supported rebel groups backed by Turkey.\n\n\u201cWe have people who were displaced from Afrin because of the Turkish invasion \u2014 they are worried that they will be displaced once again,\u201d he said, referring to Ankara\u2019s 2018 military offensive against a Kurdish enclave west of Tel Abyad.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople are scared. When we used to see U.S. troops in the streets of Tel Abyad, we would feel safe; they were here to protect us. Yesterday, we saw U.S. troops, but this time they were on their way out of the area, and that terrified people,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nDeYoung reported from Washington and Khattab from Beirut.
