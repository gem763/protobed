The unmanned spaceplane touched down at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida early Sunday morning, successfully wrapping up a classified mission testing various technologies.\n\n\n\nThe X-37B has a fascinating history. NASA first began toying with the idea of an unmanned spaceplane\u2014a vehicle that acts like an aircraft in our atmosphere and a spacecraft in space\u2014in the \u201890s, when the agency wanted a cheaper alternative to its classic Space Shuttle orbiter, which took months to refurbish between flights. Not only would such a spaceplane need less thrust and a smaller rocket to go to space, but a lack of crew on board meant it could take its time in low-Earth orbit to carry out missions.\n\n\n\nWhile NASA and the Air Force each developed similar craft, the project didn\u2019t get off the ground in earnest until NASA recruited the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to step in and grab the reins. DARPA\u2019s efforts ultimately led to the Boeing-built X-37B: a 29-foot-long, 9-foot-wide vehicle with a truck bed-sized payload bay and launch weight of 11,000 pounds (excluding the booster rocket) that can take cargo loads into space and return them back to engineers on Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe X-37B first went to space in 2010 and has since completed five missions. The fifth and most recent mission launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in September 2017; last August, it set a new record for its class, spending 716 continuous days in orbit.\n\n\n\nPowered by Gallium Arsenide Solar Cells with lithium-ion batteries and thrusters for orbit maneuvering and de-orbiting, the X-37B can push itself down into Earth\u2019s atmosphere for a landing, but doesn\u2019t have the engines to travel long distances in space or fly through the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what does it do up there, exactly? That\u2019s a good question. The classified nature of the program makes it seem like the X-37B is an exotic Air Force weapon system, and indeed, the spaceplane\u2019s shifty nature drives our enemies nuts. Former Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson recently said the X-37B \u201ccan do an orbit that looks like an egg and, when it\u2019s closer to Earth, it\u2019s close enough to the atmosphere to turn where it is.\u201d\n\nSo when the X-37B is out of sight on the other end of the Earth from adversaries, it can dip down into the atmosphere by using its wings and maneuvering thrusters. This increases drag, slowing down the spaceplane so it doesn\u2019t pop up on a predictive schedule.\n\nSay, for example, the Chinese military locates the X-37B in space and is guiding satellites to get a closer look at it. If our military gets wind of the operation, spotting the approaching Chinese satellites, we could order the X-37B to change its orbit\u2014ideally over South America, the opposite end of the Earth from China. The X-37B would simply fail to show up at the designated time, forcing the Chinese to reacquire the spacecraft and start the operation all over again.\n\nDespite its annoying ability to \u201cdisappear,\u201d however, the program doesn\u2019t exactly carry out James Bond-worthy spy missions. Instead, it performs \u201crisk reduction, experimentation, and concept of operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies,\u201d according to the Air Force.\n\nThe X-37B\u2019s most recent mission \u201csuccessfully hosted Air Force Research Laboratory experiments, among others\u201d and provided a \u201cride for small satellites,\u201d Randy Walden, the director of the Air Force\u2019s Rapid Capabilities Office, said in a press release.\n\nOne such experiment, per Space News , is the Air Force Research Laboratory \u2019s (AFRL) second Advanced Structurally Embedded Thermal Spreader (ASETS-II), which measures the \u201clong-term performance of an oscillating heat pipe in orbit.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s next for the X-37B, after spending 2,856 days in orbit? The Air Force is set to launch OTV-6 from Cape Canaveral sometime next spring on a ULA Atlas 5 rocket. No word yet on what the specific mission will be, but no doubt we\u2019ll follow it just as closely as the last one.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The mysterious unmanned craft spent an astonishing 780 days in orbit.", "authors": ["Andrew Daniels"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XNUOlGhYjg4smFa5_kzRrg--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/63a0757e9bd1418e976fbc997164658c", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
