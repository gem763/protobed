Have any other women had this happen to them? #metoo #cyberharassment @SCFGallagher .\n\n\"After the flight attendants spoke with the guys, I walked through the aisle and took a picture of them. Afterwards, a young guy came up to me and said he heard about the chat between me and the guys and wanted to apologize on their behalf.\n\n\"They were on a rugby trip and he was one of the leaders. He said the guys had been drinking and he\u2019d talk to them, was sorry and hoped we could leave it at that.\n\n(Image: Jessica Van Meir)\n\n\"What matters to me is not going after these guys, but making sure they understand why it was harmful.\"\n\nVirgin Atlantic apologised to Ms Meir and said it was reviewing its systems to prevent a repeat incident.\n\nA spokesman tweeted: \"Whilst we are not always responsible for the actions of our passengers, we do not deem this behavior acceptable.\"", "description": "Jessica Van Meir, from Atlanta, Georgia, US, received inappropriate messages from a drunk rugby group on a Virgin Atlantic flight", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Jessica Van Meir"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20534231.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jessica-Van-Meir.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
