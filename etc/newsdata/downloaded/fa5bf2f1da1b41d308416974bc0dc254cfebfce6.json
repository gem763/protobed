It expects basic earnings per share to be within range of 143 cents per share and 175 cents per share.\n\n\"This is an approximate improvement of 125% to 131%, compared to the prior corresponding period's basic loss of 572c per share,\" the trading statement read.\n\nThe expected increase in earnings per share is likely due to the previous period's financials being impacted by a R874m impairment of its UK-based business Gourmet Kitchen Burger Restaurants (GBK). There are no impairments for the current period, the group explained.\n\nThe group has operations in South Africa, the rest of Africa and the Middle East (AME) and the UK.\n\n\n\nIn a voluntary update to shareholders, issued on September 11, the group noted that \"difficult trading conditions\" had impacted its markets in both SA and the UK.\n\n\n\nWhile the group's brands in South Africa and the AME have recorded revenue growth, its UK business is undergoing a restructuring programme. Famous Brands has said the business is benefiting from the resulting operational improvements. Sales in its UK division declines as a result of the closure of stores, according to its September update.\n\nThe group's supply chain operations did not perform so well either. The manufacturing business, for example, saw a marginal decline in sales, due to the loss of a major client. Its logistics operations reported revenue growth of 3%, but margins deteriorated due to softer sales, sustained low food inflation and once-off costs related to the relocation of its facility in Free State- but the group said this was a planned cost. The group also cut margins in its logistics operations to stay competitive.\n\nThe final results for the six-month period will be released on Monday, October 28.", "description": "Owner of food franchises Debonairs and Steers, Famous Brands, expects its earnings to improve by more than 100% for the six months ended August 31, 2019.", "authors": ["Lameez Omarjee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2407/58b079e3e9f646a9b4ed439e26f93560.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
