Ex-dividend means that investors that purchase the stock on or after the 9th of September will not receive this dividend, which will be paid on the 25th of September.\n\nCPMC Holdings's next dividend payment will be CN\u00a50.08 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of CN\u00a50.096 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, CPMC Holdings has a trailing yield of approximately 3.1% on its current stock price of HK$3.4. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for CPMC Holdings\n\nIf a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. CPMC Holdings is paying out an acceptable 50% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Over the last year it paid out 72% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.\n\nIt's positive to see that CPMC Holdings's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nClick here to see how much of its profit CPMC Holdings paid out over the last 12 months.\n\nSEHK:906 Historical Dividend Yield, September 4th 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nWhen earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see CPMC Holdings's earnings per share have dropped 9.1% a year over the past five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 9 years, CPMC Holdings has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average. That's interesting, but the combination of a growing dividend despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out more of the company's profits. This can be valuable for shareholders, but it can't go on forever.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid CPMC Holdings? While earnings per share are shrinking, it's encouraging to see that at least CPMC Holdings's dividend appears sustainable, with earnings and cashflow payout ratios that are within reasonable bounds. It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective, and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being.\n\nKeen to explore more data on CPMC Holdings's financial performance?
