We believe that the best chance of securing Kylie's safe return is through diplomatic channels,\" they wrote.\n\nAccording to the University of Melbourne's webpage, Moore-Gilbert is a lecturer in Islamic Studies specializing in Middle Eastern politics. She has published work on the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings and authoritarian governments.\n\nShe has been sentenced to 10 years in jail, reported The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nIn a statement to the Australian parliament this week, Australian foreign affairs minister Marise Payne said that the woman now identified as Moore-Gilbert had been detained by Iranian authorities for \"a number of months.\"\n\nShe is not the only Australian national recently detained detained by Iran, with two travel bloggers, identified by the Australian government as Mark Firkin and Jolie King, arrested several weeks ago near Tehran. Moore-Gilbert's case is not believed to be related to Firkin and King's arrest.\n\n\"Since they were detained, the Australian Government has been pressing the Iranian Government for their release. I have communicated with my Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Zarif, many times about these cases, including through face-to-face meetings,\" said Senator Payne in her remarks to parliament.\n\n\"The government have been making efforts to ensure they are being treated fairly, humanely and in custom to international norms,\" she said.\n\nAll three Australians are reportedly being held in Tehran's Evin prison, where British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was jailed on spying charges in 2016. Conditions in the prison are notoriously tough, reported Business Insider Friday.\n\nThe charges against Moore-Gilbert have not been disclosed.\n\nThe detentions come amid deteriorating relations between western countries and Iran, with US President Donald Trump earlier in the year scrapping the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated with his predecessor, Barack Obama, and imposing tough new economic sanctions on the country.\n\nIn retaliation, Iran has seized a British-flagged ship travelling through the Persian Gulf. Australian vessels recently joined the US Navy in patrols just off the Strait of Hormuz to secure the safety of international shipping lanes.\n\nIn her remarks, Payne said she believed the recent arrests were not connected to international tensions.\n\n\"I can say these arrests do not relate to broader issues. We have no reason to think that these arrests are connected to international concern over Iran's nuclear program, United Nations sanctions or sanctions enforcement, or maritime security and the safety of civilian shipping,\" she said.", "description": "Kylie Moore-Gilbert is a lecturer in Middle Eastern politics and was detained several months ago in Iran on charges that have not been made public.", "authors": ["Tom Porter"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7cf6c721214c37fa306f45-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
