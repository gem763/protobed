They\u2019ve damaged Cuba\u2019s nascent private sector and overall economy and served as a boon to the Cuban government by restoring a hostility that has long been politically useful for Cuban leaders.\n\nThe true threat to the Cuban government was Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama. Unlike Trump, he rejected hard-line, anti-Cuba policies and instead tried to break down the walls between the two nations, declaring on a historic visit to the island nation that \u201cCuba doesn\u2019t have to be defined by being against the United States\u201d and embracing commonalities between them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe proof that Obama\u2019s visit was threatening to the Cuban government came from Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister Bruno Rodr\u00edguez, who dubbed Obama\u2019s remarks as \u201ca deep attack on our ideas, our history, our culture and our symbols.\u201d\n\nHow could conciliation and the first presidential visit to Cuba since 1928 be viewed as an attack?\n\nBecause Obama pointed out a dark commonality in the two nation\u2019s histories: the role of white supremacy in building their economies. This was problematic for the Cuban government, not because it was untrue, but because Cuba\u2019s government long built support for Cuban nationalism (and by extension Communism) by juxtaposing itself to the United States\u2019 long history of racism. By reminding average Cubans that the nations had more in common \u2014 and that Cuba had a way to go to reach its stated egalitarian ideals \u2014 Obama threatened to undermine a crucial pillar of Cuban nationalism.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNationalist ideologies invariably feed on narratives of uniqueness. Since the 19th century, Cuban nationalists have used race as a defining feature of what distinguishes the island from the United States, the land of segregation, racial violence and Jim Crow. As a veteran from the War of Independence (1895-1898), Lt. Col. Lino D\u2019Ou stated in 1930, \u201cFor us black Cubans, the neighbor to the north \u2026 is the race of lynching!\u201d American officials, scholars, investors and journalists, who often expressed contempt for Cuba in racist terms, helped solidify Cubans\u2019 association between racism and the United States. As the Cleveland Press put it in 1911, \u201cCuba is politically impossible, socially impossible, economically impossible, because morally rotten \u2026 The fault is racial. Cuba \u2026 yields a hard, indocile mixed blood that riots in depravity.\u201d\n\nThe Cuban revolution of 1959 transformed the contrast between Cuban and American domestic racial orders into an unbridgeable breach. In fact, authorities proclaimed that the eradication of racism and discrimination in the island was made possible only through the elimination of U.S. economic, social, cultural and political influences in Cuba. As Fidel Castro noted in a December 1959 speech, the U.S. had no moral standing to oppose a revolution that was \u201csolving social conflicts \u2026 like the problem of racial discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe very presence of Obama and his family in Havana demolished some of the most sacred pillars of Cuban nationalism. Here was an accessible, charismatic American president who was also African American. As he spoke of the advances that black Americans have made since the civil rights battles of the 1950s and 1960s, Obama also insinuated that Afro-Cubans\u2019 struggles for equality had not concluded yet. Then by referencing the need to \u201chelp lift up\u201d black Cubans, he directly challenged the official narratives of racelessness that had long infused Cuban nationalism.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nObama highlighted a shared historical foundation of slavery and colonialism that has shaped both Cuban and American history. He was of course correct: The modern United States and Cuba were built on the backs of enslaved Africans. Cuba led the way. In fact, by the time the first Africans arrived in a British colony 400 years ago, enslaved Africans had been toiling in Cuba for a century. Slaveholders in both countries created social orders that placed Africans at the bottom of society, tied whiteness to citizenship and equated blackness with enslavement. These racist orders, enshrined in law over centuries, turned blackness into a formidable barrier to mobility and prosperity, in Cuba as well as in the United States.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, when narratives of Cuban nationalism began to emerge, the process of embedding race into law had advanced further in the United States South than in Cuba. In other words, Cuban nationalism does contain a few kernels of truth.\n\nBut, at the same time, mid-19th century Cuba was as brutal a slave plantation society as any of the states in the U.S. South. As in the United States, the end of slavery in Cuba was achieved by bloody military conflict. Emancipation was driven by the actions of black insurgents and of enslaved individuals, who made use of every available recourse to escape bondage. Indeed, Cuban white patriots and intellectuals had to invent myths of racial harmony and fraternity precisely because black agency could not be ignored or fully contained. As they constructed an allegedly inclusive and raceless nation, the crass racism of the post-Reconstruction United States came in handy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy placing both countries on shared historical trajectories, Obama\u2019s visit not only shook up American-Cuban relations, but the historical narratives that had sustained Cuban racial exceptionalism for over a century. Moreover, by noting improvements made by American society in the area of race and inequalities that still exist in Cuba, he challenged the very basis of Cuban nationalism. This is why the foreign affairs minister characterized his remarks as a \u201cdeep attack.\u201d Cuban authorities did not know how to handle a friendly, black American president.\n\nThe election of Donald Trump is, in that sense, a boon to Cuban nationalism, the perfect caricature of a grotesque, arrogant, ignorant imperialism that is reassuring to Cuban authorities and provides a useful foil. As Trump transforms the White House into the Whites\u2019 House, his racist tweets and statements are the stuff that those wishing to restore a racially based contrast between the United States and Cuba could have only dreamed of.\n\nObama understood well that a new relationship with Cuba would have to build on commonalities, even if those commonalities are as execrable as racism and enslavement. Cuban authorities could not stomach the notion that these shared pasts shape lives, opportunities and practices, both in Cuba and the United States, in sometimes similar ways. President Trump has come to their rescue, giving them, again, the gift of American racism.\n\nAD", "description": "President Barack Obama challenged the narrative upon which the Cuban government has long relied.
