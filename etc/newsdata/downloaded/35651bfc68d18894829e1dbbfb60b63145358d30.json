Cody, Kayla and Katherine who plan to marry in 2022 also want more children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while they\u2019re committed to each other, they are not opposed to the concept of an open triad, meaning that they could each date other people.\n\nCody and his wife, Kayla, and their poly baby, Khloe-Rae (Picture: MDWfeatures/@thektribe_)\n\n\u2018There have been bumps and learning curves in the road just like any relationship, but we\u2019ve always done everything we can to make our family work,\u2019 says Katherine.\n\n\u2018It was love at first sight for all of us. There was a special feeling we got that we knew meant there was something special between us.\n\n\u2018To us, polyamory gives you the ability to construct the relationship structure that really works for you. A triad formation is what is working for us right now.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t have any plans to change that in the future, but we also aren\u2019t against expanding our tribe in the future. But we are happy how we are now.\u2019\n\nThe throuple is an open triad, which means they can date separately, dyadically, or as a triad. However, with young kids and busy work schedules, they just about have enough time for one another.\n\nIn January 2019, Cody and Kayla both proposed to Katherine with candles, flowers and balloons ready for her when she came home from work.\n\nBefore the proposal, Cody and Kayla wrote a joint letter to Katherine\u2019s parents detailing their plans to get their blessing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKatherine added: \u2018The three of us do our best to be open and honest, demonstrating that no relationship is perfect, but with enough work and dedication we\u2019ve made it last.\n\n\u2018Everybody deals with jealousy, but it usually means there is a deeper issue that is causing the reaction. It takes a lot of self-evaluation and will to do a lot of self-reflection.\n\n\u2018Communicating your feelings with your partner about jealousy is important so that you don\u2019t start to take anything out on them.\u2019\n\nKayla and Katherine first started chatting on Facebook before they went on a three-way date with Cody (Picture: MDWfeatures / @thektribe_)\n\nThe triad plans to have two to three more children in the future and hope to open a bed and breakfast in Colorado.\n\nSince being open about their relationship on Instagram, the triad have gotten some criticism. Most, however, assume that Katherine is Cody\u2019s sister.\n\n\u2018We know that polyamory isn\u2019t for everybody, but we do think that more people should know it is an option if you feel like it\u2019s right for you,\u2019 explains Katherine.\n\n\u2018It isn\u2019t just a sexual thing either. That\u2019s one of the first questions we get.\n\nThe trio parent all three kids and want more in the future (Picture: MDWfeatures / @thektribe_)\n\n\u2018We get a lot of confused looks from strangers, but people usually keep to themselves with their opinions for the most part.\n\n\u2018We just want to be able to let people know that polyamory isn\u2019t a threat to monogamy, which is something we\u2019ve run into a lot just being out with our relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We are all feminists and are bringing our children up to be inclusive and open people and we\u2019re very proud of that.\u2019\n\nMORE: Polyamorous married couple get engaged to woman they met on Tinder\n\nMORE: Are we moving towards a society where everyone is polyamorous or in open relationships?\n\nMORE: Bride and groom fall in love with the bridesmaid and enter a polyamorous relationship\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Technician, Cody Kurkowski, 28, from Ohio, and dance teacher Kayla, 27, proposed to girlfriend Katherine Zepernick in 2016.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89398289-e1571044099677_1571045416.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
