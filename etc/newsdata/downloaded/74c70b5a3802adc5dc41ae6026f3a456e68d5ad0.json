Anti-riot police used tear gas and batons against some protesters, who have been demonstrating for days against the increase.\n\nThe unrest exposes divisions in the country, one of Latin America's wealthiest but also one of its most unequal. There have been growing complaints about the cost of living - especially in Santiago, a city of some six million people - and calls for economic reforms.\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nSpeaking on television, President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era said the aim of the state of emergency was to \"ensure public order and the safety of public and private property\". The measure allows authorities to restrict people's freedom of movement and their right to assembly.\n\nHe also said the government would \"call for a dialogue... to alleviate the suffering of those affected by the increase in fares\".\n\nEarlier this month, the government increased fares by as much as $1.17 (\u00a30.90) for a journey during peak hours, blaming higher energy costs and a weaker peso.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nSpeaking to Radio Agricultural earlier, President Pi\u00f1era said: \"It's one thing to demonstrate and another to commit the vandalism we have observed. This isn't protest, it's crime.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many people had been detained or injured. Despite the protests, authorities said they would not reverse the fare increase.\n\nRead more about Chile\n\nThe Chilean government condemned what it described as \"acts of violence and vandalism\" that were \"being carried out by organised groups\", and invoked the State Security Law that imposes harsher sentences for those found guilty of public disorder.\n\nThe protests continued after nightfall, with people clanging pots and blocking traffic.\n\nEnergy company Enel Chile said vandals had set fire to its high-rise corporate headquarters in the centre of Santiago. It said its workers were evacuated and no-one was injured.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nAfter Friday's protests, metro authorities said all lines would remain closed for at least two days due to the serious destruction that made it impossible to operate the system safely. The damages were estimated at $700,000, including broken surveillance cameras and other equipment.\n\nSantiago's underground system is considered one of Latin America's most modern, with 140km (86 miles) of track and 136 stations.\n\nAll pictures copyright.", "description": "Protests sparked by a metro fare increase turn violent and spread across Santiago.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/27FF/production/_109293201_ac2d3fa3-db35-4144-92f4-39df18aac6dd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
