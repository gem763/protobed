He told a press conference that \u201cmalicious hands\u201d had also targeted security forces on Friday, the bloodiest day of the unrest in Baghdad.\n\nProtesters and journalists on the scene say they witnessed security forces firing on demonstrators with some saying that snipers were taking part. Maad said most of those killed on Friday were hit in the head and heart.\n\nProtests have raged in Baghdad and southern cities since Tuesday. Maan said 104 people, including eight security force members, have been killed and more than 6,100 wounded, including more than 1,200 security members.\n\nOn Sunday, army soldiers fired in the direction of about 300 anti-government protesters who gathered in a suburb of the Iraqi capital.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Iraqi security forces fire tear gas at protesters.

Troops blocked the main road preventing them from advancing and fired above their heads.\n\nIraq\u2019s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, called on Saturday for an end to the protests, saying he was ready to meet with protesters to hear their demands. He said there were orders for the security forces not to use live ammunition except in strict cases of self-defence.\n\nSecurity forces are \u201ctrying to carry out their duties\u201d and have also incurred casualties. Abdul-Mahdi said the violence has been \u201creciprocated\u201d and promised an investigation to determine who had been firing live ammunition.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t accept the continuation of the situation like this,\u201d Abdul-Mahdi told his cabinet on Saturday. \u201cWe hear of snipers, firebombs, burning a policeman, a citizen.\u201d He added that \u201cnot a political party office\u201d or government office has been spared attacks.\n\n\u201cI am ready to go wherever our brotherly protesters are and meet them or send them envoys to other locations without any armed forces,\u201d Abdul-Mahdi said. \u201cI will go and meet them without weapons and sit with them for hours to listen to their demands.\u201d\n\nHe announced a list of executive decisions focusing on providing housing for those on low incomes, unemployment benefits and vocational training. He also decreed that those killed in the protests, whether demonstrators or security, would be considered \u201cmartyrs\u201d eligible for state benefits.\n\nThe unrest is the most serious challenge facing Iraq two years after the victory against Islamic State militants. The chaos also comes at a critical time for the government, which has been caught in the middle of increasing tensions in the region, chiefly between Iran and the US. Iraq is allied with both countries and hosts thousands of American troops, as well as powerful paramilitary forces linked with Iran.\n\nThe UN envoy for Iraq appealed for an end to the violence and called for holding to account those responsible. \u201cThis must stop. I call on all parties to pause and reflect,\u201d Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert tweeted on Saturday night.", "description": "Interior ministry spokesman denies claims security forces clashed with demonstrators", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc4c361c4c0817b6cdcd10b03d68c1c4d173df4d/0_0_2638_1582/master/2638.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=86a2ae7193b7ed78b3503838a7274f7a", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
