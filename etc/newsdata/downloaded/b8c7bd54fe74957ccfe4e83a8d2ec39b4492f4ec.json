Once a user decides on something they want to watch, Google will then show where it is available to watch online.\n\nIn order to personalise recommendations even further, users can select which streaming services they have subscriptions to, as well as whether they have cable TV or satellite subscriptions.\n\nGoogle claims that any data gathered will only be used to further improve recommendations, rather than to improve targeted advertising.\n\nIn a separate post, Google also revealed the top TV shows people are currently searching for in the US, with Saturday Night Live coming out on top.\n\nEntering its 45th season on 28 September 2019, the late-night TV show has seen a resurgence in recent years, in part thanks to satirical sketches aimed at US President Donald Trump.\n\nOther shows that are receiving high search volumes include The Walking Dead, The Simpsons, and Grey's Anatomy.", "description": "Google has introduced a new Tinder-style tool that lets users search for TV shows and movies in the same way they would look for a potential dating match.
