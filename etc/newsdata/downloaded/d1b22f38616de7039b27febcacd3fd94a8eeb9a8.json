People from the UK are not involved.\n\n'Huge progress'\n\nResearchers led by a team from Canada's McMaster University looked at the fate of 160,000 people enrolled in the programme, between 2005 and 2016.\n\nThese people had an average age of 50 at the start.\n\nThere were more than 11,000 deaths, with those in low-income countries nearly four times more likely to die than those in high-income countries.\n\nIn about 2,000 cases, the cause of death was unclear.\n\nOf the others, cardiovascular disease caused more than 40% in middle- and low-income countries but less than a quarter in high-income countries.\n\nThe researchers say this could be because richer countries provide more medication and treat more people in hospital.\n\nJeremy Pearson, of the British Heart Foundation, said \"huge progress\" meant many people were surviving heart attacks and strokes but growing numbers were living with \"disability and the debilitating after effects\" of cardiovascular disease.", "description": "Cancer claims more lives than cardiovascular disease in wealthy countries but the reverse is true for poorer nations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8CD5/production/_105935063_gettyimages-530284279.jpg"}
