We needed that, we haven\u2019t started the league well, but we played with heart, we played with force, we attacked quickly, especially in the first half. The second half we continued well but it was more equal.\u2019\n\nFred is aware that he\u2019s so far failed to live up to expectations since arriving at United, but the Brazil international insists he\u2019s still \u2018adapting\u2019 to the physical nature of the Premier League.\n\n\u2018My first season was difficult but that is normal when a footballer changes league,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018The Ukrainian league isn\u2019t as strong as the Premier League. It\u2019s faster and more physical here.\n\n\u2018You need to start games strongly and finish them strongly. It\u2019s the full force for 90 minutes, but it takes time to adapt to English football when you come from Ukraine, even though I was playing against some of the best teams in the Champions League, but I believe I am adapting.\u2019\n\nFred thanked Solskjaer and Carrick for their support (Picture: Getty)\n\nAmid his struggles, Fred has received constant support from Manchester United\u2019s coaching staff and the midfielder has thanked the likes of Mike Phelan and Carrick for their advice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have a good relationship with the manager and the coaches.\n\n\u2018I speak to the coach [Mike Phelan] every day. And to Michael [Carrick] and Kieran [McKenna].\n\n\u2018Michael played in my position; he knows what he is saying. They are always encouraging me and I feel the support of fans, too. And I thank them for that.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m learning day by day. I feel like I\u2019m getting better. I have a big heart. I will play better. I like Manchester. My family are here and they like it too.\n\n\u2018They are speaking English. I\u2019m having English classes too but it\u2019s not possible all the time because we travel a lot but we speak lots of languages here.\u2019\n\nMORE: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer provides injury updates on Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic and Axel Tuanzebe", "description": "Fred says he's 'happy' with his display against Liverpool and has thanked the likes of Michael Carrick for their help and support after a tough start to his Manchester United...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1182279084_1571663118.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
