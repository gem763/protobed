The players have not applied themselves. Pochettino has probably thought, \u2018that\u2019s as far as I can take this club\u2019.\n\n\u201cIf they (the Tottenham board) had listened to him, they wouldn\u2019t be in this position now. I\u2019ve seen this at Tottenham before, it stinks of that at the minute.\u201d\n\nJenas then criticised Spurs players for failing to react throughout the game and \u201chiding\u201d.\n\n\u201cLook at this, players standing behind players, that is hiding. It happened throughout the game,\" Jenas added.\n\nToby Alderweireld and Eric Dier applaud the travelling Tottenham fans (Action)\n\n\"I think motivation is a big thing here. Alderweireld and Vertonghem, two of the most professional players I know, they work their socks off, but if I was them, I would be saying why am I committed to you?\n\n\"Even though I\u2019ve given you half my career. Same for Eriksen, there are too many of those players. It creates a poor harmony. It\u2019s so difficult to manage that situation as a manager.\u201d", "description": "Jermaine Jenas has declared the end for this Tottenham side after Brighton compounded a nightmare week for Mauricio Pochettino.The Seagulls dominated Spurs to coast to a 3-0 victory, heaping more misery on Mauricio Pochettino after the 7-2 thrashing against Bayern Munich midweek in the Champions League", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/11qdZtOCoaae7Z9lvD7X7g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNTI7aD03ODg-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nJMHEhgW3ZT6Qxm614osXQ--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/0d1878985789ee172630c7e1db13ab43", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
