Mr. Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George both favored keeping rates steady in the absence of a tangible downturn in the economy. St. Louis Fed leader James Bullard wanted a bigger decrease than his colleagues as \u201cinsurance\u201d against rising risks to the economic outlook and as a means to boost still-low inflation.\n\nMr. Rosengren also dissented at the July Fed policy-setting meeting, when the central bank also cut rates. It is widely expected to lower rates again this year, but Fed officials are split on the matter and haven\u2019t given firm guidance.\n\nMr. Rosengren\u2019s speech focused on how lowering rates in a strong economy can boost risk-taking and borrowing, which increase the prospects of a more severe downturn in the future.\n\n\u201cOne potential cost of increased accommodation is that very low rates can encourage households and firms to take excessive risks,\u201d Mr. Rosengren said, adding \u201cthis could show up in the form of increased household and firm leverage, with prices for risky assets reaching levels that may not be sustainable over time.\u201d\n\nCutting rates in the current environment \u201cinvolves pushing rates lower when asset prices, and in particular some risky asset prices, already seem inflated,\u201d Mr. Rosengren said. \u201cI don\u2019t see current financial risks as causing a downturn, but such conditions have the potential to amplify a downturn, should it occur,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Rosengren noted the risks posed by commercial real estate, which have long been a concern of his, as a possible vector to amplify trouble. Without naming any firms, Mr. Rosengren noted the particular concerns posed by co-working companies. He made this comment as the parent of office-sharing firm WeWork postponed its initial public offering amid investor doubts about its valuation and concerns about its corporate governance.\n\nOffice-sharing firms are particularly exposed to risks should the economy run into trouble, and could wound landlords in the process, Mr. Rosengren said. \u201cIn a downturn the co-working company would be exposed to the loss of tenant income, which puts both them and the property owner at risk if they cannot make lease payments to the owner of the building,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that commercial real estate losses will be larger in the next downturn because of this growing feature of the real estate market, which could ultimately make runs and vacancies more likely due to this new leasing model,\u201d Mr. Rosengren said.\n\nIn comments at the event, Mr. Rosengren said that surprisingly strong short-term rate pressures that struck the market this week are probably not an enduring issue for the central bank. What\u2019s happened in markets doesn\u2019t appear to be \u201ca long-run problem. I don\u2019t view it as a problem overall,\u201d he said, adding that at some point the Fed will need to decide how to manage its balance sheet given the shifting liquidity needs in the financial system.\n\nMr. Rosengren also added himself to the list of U.S. central bankers that have no appetite for negative rates in the U.S., as a general matter of principle.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think negative interest rates are the way to go\u201d when rates are at zero and other stimulus options are needed, Mr. Rosengren said. \u201cIf the highest return is negative, that\u2019s not a great signal to the public,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said what\u2019s happened in European bond markets, where the European Central Bank has negative rates, shouldn\u2019t be replicated in the U.S. He said pushing government debt into negative territory is \u201cnot something we should do in the United States.\u201d\n\nWrite to Michael S.
