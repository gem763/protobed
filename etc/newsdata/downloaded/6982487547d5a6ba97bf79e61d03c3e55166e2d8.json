The new regulatory framework establishes the role of a central cryptographic agency meant to lead public cryptographic work, creating guidelines and policies for the industry.\n\nImplicit cryptocurrency regulation\n\nThe draft of the law was published on May 7 by a Chinese news outlet. The text is largely focused on government centralized password management and does not explicitly mention cryptocurrency, though it does focus on cryptography, a key component underpinning cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nWan explained:\n\n\u201cThe key take away is \u2014 the developing of new cryptography, hashing algo, even the usage of the tech, will be in the official legal realm. This means you need to follow the CCP standard for all \u2018encrypted\u2019 behaviors, which can be VERY broad, from mining to block propagation.\u201d\n\nPreparing for China\u2019s national crypto\n\nShe concluded that the law is building the foundation for the upcoming Chinese national cryptocurrency, though there is no official timetable for its launch, one Chinese official confirmed in September.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported yesterday, China\u2019s President Xi Jinping has called for the country to accelerate its adoption of blockchain technologies.\n\nMeanwhile, this past week, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg warned that Chinese superiority in the digital currency space could put the U.S. dollar at risk in an attempt to sell lawmakers his plans for the Libra stablecoin.\n\n\"China is moving quickly to launch a similar idea in the coming months. We can't sit here and assume that because America is today the leader that it will always get to be the leader if we don't innovate,\u201d he argued in an official statement.", "description": "China has passed the first-ever law specifically aimed at regulating cryptography and password management taking effect on Jan. 1, 2020", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy81NmI1OGExNWIzNTQ4Mjc0NzcyZDBjNmQyZTQzZTlhYS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
