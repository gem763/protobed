There\u2019s just nothing conventional about them.\n\nConventional oil and gas discoveries have fallen by the wayside since the shale boom and the subsequent oil price collapse. In fact, they\u2019ve fallen to their lowest in 70 years. But there are still some amazing discoveries in the mysterious deep.\n\nAll in all, this year has seen new discoveries of nearly 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent, compared to 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent discovered last year.\n\nBut what\u2019s most striking is that new discoveries aren\u2019t even close to keeping pace with the loss of conventional resources. According to Rystad, the current resource replacement ratio for conventional resources is only 16 percent. In other words, only one barrel out of every six consumed is being replaced with new resources.\n\nSo not only has our pace of discovery declined, but discoveries are also in much more challenging geological venues and typically offshore, which means it could take many years just to bring new resources online.\n\nWhile Russia technically has chalked up the most oil discoveries in terms of Bboe of recoverable reserves, the year\u2019s not over yet, and the Guyana-Suriname basin is proven a tantalizing prospect. Not only has ExxonMobil made 14 discoveries there, but Tullow has chimed in with two of its own nearby, and Apache is drilling right now in the Suriname side of this basin.\n\nIf Apache strikes, then investors will be looking for a repeat of the dramatic discovery pace right across the maritime border in Guyana.\n\nBut until then, it\u2019s Russia in the number one spot on the discovery chart for 2019, followed by Guyana and Cyprus.\n\n#1 Russia - 1.5 Bboe in Russian Arctic Waters\n\nSo far this year, Russia has discovered nearly 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent (Bboe) thanks to the Dinkov and Nyarmeyskoye finds on the Yamal peninsula shelf in the Kara Sea. In natural gas terms, that\u2019s a whopping 17 trillion cubic feet (Tcf).\n\nBut this is gas for Gazprom. When it comes to Arctic oil, Russia\u2019s state-run Rosneft is having a tougher time.\n\nTo get its Arctic projects off the ground, Rosneft will need $40 billion in tax cuts from the government. According to The Moscow Times, Rosneft had secured a deal with Indian financiers to invest in a 15-20-percent stake, but that was only going to happen if Rosneft was granted a $40-billion tax break over the next 30 years.\n\nThe problem for investors is that while Rosneft\u2019s Vostok Oil project reserves are worth around $15 billion, climate change is causing oil and gas infrastructure to sink into the ground, making the project even more costly.\n\nSo, Russia may be leading discoveries so far this year, but extraction is another issue entirely.\n\n#2 Guyana: More Than 6 Billion Barrels, And Climbing\n\nExxonMobil just put Guyana on the oil and gas map for the first time.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a big discovery; it\u2019s a huge discovery. In fact, it\u2019s a string of 14 discoveries so far - just from Exxon. Tullow Oil has also announced two discoveries.\n\nPrior to the last three discoveries listed below, Guyana had already hit 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the Stabroek Block.\n\nThen came these in rapid succession:\n\n- Discovery No. 14: Tripletail-1, Exxon.\n\n- Discovery No. 15: Jethro-1, Tullow - With partners Total, Eco Atlantic, and Qatar Petroleum, Tullow expects its find near 100 million barrels from Jethro-1 in Guyana\u2019s Orinduik block, where the well encountered 55 meters of net oil pay in August.\n\n- Discovery No. 16: Joe-1, Tullow - Piggybacking on the success of Jethro-1, Tullow announced in September that it had made its second oil discovery in Guyana. Joe-1 encountered 14 meters of net pay. The find was important for Tullow, who said the find de-risks the west part of the Orinduik Block, were a number of other similar prospects had already been identified.\n\nThe potential for Guyana is huge, with some estimating Guyana\u2019s future production at 750,000 within the next five years - which would be essentially one barrel of oil produced for every man, woman, and child - every day.\n\nWhat could possibly trip this up? Well, for starters, a maritime border dispute with Venezuela, and some tricky domestic politics that will see an election next spring, right about the time Exxon is expecting first production from it\u2019s Liza Phase 1 project.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Despite the oil industry currently going through a tough time, there are plenty of huge discoveries being made around the globe", "authors": ["Julianne Geiger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
