Pak said Podolsky arranged for a SkyBonus account to be registered in the name of a fertility center owned by a relative of Vega Travel\u2019s president.\n\nWhen Podolsky booked Delta flights for its customers who were unaffiliated with the fertility clinic, he would use the clinic\u2019s SkyBonus account, fraudulently accruing millions of points, according to Pak.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe then used the points for free air travel and other benefits, the U.S. attorney said.\n\n\u201cPodolsky used his knowledge of the travel industry to take advantage of his travel agency clients,\u201d Pak said. \u201cThrough his access, he allegedly took advantage of Delta Air Lines corporate frequent flyer program, illegally reaping millions of SkyBonus points worth more than $1.75 million.\u201d\n\nThe FBI investigated the case. Chris Hacker, special agent in charge of FBI Atlanta, said the goverment would prosecute anyone engaged in similar scams.\n\n\u201cThe fraudulent accumulation of frequent flyer miles in the travel industry may seem like a victimless crime, however, large corporations stand to lose significant profits,\u201d Hacker said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "A federal grand jury indicted the man on 12 counts of wire fraud.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/delta-video-thumbnail.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
