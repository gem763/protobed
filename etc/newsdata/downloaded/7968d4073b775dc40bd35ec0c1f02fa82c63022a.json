In the Big Apple for this week's UN General Assembly, he was set to address a select group of business leaders on opportunities in the United Kingdom, in the shadow of the Vessel, a structure recently built by his designer friend Thomas Heatherwick.\n\nKate Maltby\n\nBut the morning didn't go according to plan for Johnson. Instead he found himself stammering out a response to a different crisis: a Supreme Court ruling that has sent yet another earthquake through the already fractious landscape of British politics. The United Kingdom's highest court ruled unanimously Tuesday -- with a panel of 11 judges -- that Johnson acted unlawfully when he suspended the British Parliament for five weeks at the end of this summer. There was the usual bluster from Johnson in his reaction -- an assertion that he \" respects \" the judiciary was followed immediately by an insistence that he \" strongly disagrees \" with the legal findings of Britain's preeminent judges. Notably, there was an apology missing. At no point in Johnson's speech did he apologize to Britain's people, or to the Queen.\n\nWhy did Boris owe the Queen an apology? Because by upholding a previous ruling by Scotland's Court Session, the Supreme Court ruled that Johnson had misled the sovereign herself. As the head of state, the Queen has to give permission to \"prorogue,\" or suspend, Parliament; Johnson's lawyers had assured her they were acting constitutionally. It is unclear whether the Queen's own team could or should have imposed further scrutiny before they agreed; what is clear is that by his actions, Johnson has significantly imperiled the last seemingly safe component of Britain's shaky constitution: the institution of the monarchy. The royal family are big losers from Johnson's staggeringly embarrassing behavior.\n\nJUST WATCHED PM Boris Johnson fires back after Supreme Court ruling Replay More Videos ...

As a constitutional figurehead, she certainly isn't allowed to pronounce on matters of personal political opinion -- so even when another member of the royal family ventures an opinion on a social matter, whether it's Prince Charles lobbying for organic farming or Meghan Markle talking about the environment, there's always cause for a discussion about whether this royal intervention is \"political.\" (Unfairly for Meghan, however, the tabloid press rarely applies the same standards to all of them.) But the Queen also has the power to appoint or dismiss heads of government, supposedly only ever doing so as a formality to confirm the results of an election or a no-confidence vote.\n\nThings get constitutionally murky, however, when the democratic will that the monarch is supposed to endorse becomes too difficult for her to read. She's always supposed to appoint as prime minister the person who is most capable of commanding a majority of democratic representatives in Britain's House of Commons -- but it's not always easy to tell who that person is.\n\nRead More", "description": "Boris Johnson has demonstrated that the Queen can't even do her one job: standing up to him, says Kate Maltby, who argues that the rest of Britain is left to wonder what on earth the monarchy is for.", "authors": ["Opinion Kate Malt"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190517092415-01-queen-elizabeth-0507-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
