Lorenzo gives his locks for the weekend. USA TODAY\n\nTom Brady has passed Peyton Manning in the record books for one statistical category, and he's likely not finished.\n\nThe New England Patriots quarterback moved into second place in the NFL career passing yardage list in Thursday night's game against the New York Giants. Needing only 18 yards to pass Manning's career mark of 71,940, Brady passed his former rival on a 19-yard completion to running back Sony Michel.\n\nBut Brady, c42, remains a good distance behind New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who is in the top spot with 74,845 yards. Brees also could build on that total upon his return from a thumb injury suffered earlier this season.\n\nBrady's next major milestone might be eclipsing Manning for the most career passing touchdowns of all time. Manning set the record with 539 scoring strikes while Brady entered the night with 527.\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz.", "description": "Tom Brady surpassed one of Peyton Manning's", "authors": ["Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz", "Published P.M.
