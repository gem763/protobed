Here are my 4 best pieces of advice.", "language": "en", "text": "3. Lose your job\n\nGetty Images\n\nLose your job after everyone has high-fived you. Sit at home feeling like a bum while the bills rack up and your partner (or dog if you don't have a partner) looks at you differently. Have that person or animal stand by you through the struggle. Feel a tear run down your cheek as you think about the fact that they haven't given up on you.\n\nGo to the gym and get the blood pumping. Think about how you lost your job and then lift the next size up in dumbbells. Take all the pain from losing your job and channel it into those short, 30-minute sessions at the gym. Read \"Can't Hurt Me\" by David Goggins and decide to run twice as far on the treadmill as you have ever done in the whole two years you've had your gym membership.\n\nFeel the pain of the run and then keep jogging. Let it burn, feel the second-wind, and keep running. Tell yourself that as the pain starts, you can forget your job. It's the only way. Come home, have a snack, and go back to the computer sitting on your Ikea, self-assembled stand-up desk. Write even though you feel like a bum for losing your job. You're not a bum. You're in a temporary state of flux.\n\nFinish the writing session and reach out to your LinkedIn network. See if you can rustle up a few job opportunities. Book in a few coffee catchups even though you only drink coffee when writing. Have the promises of career opportunities stand up like a house of cards. Follow through and book in the meetings with hiring managers. Have two weeks pass and watch the house of cards fall into a fiery mess. You created it.\n\nCheck your bank account and see some money from your writing get deposited. Ignore it and continue to see it as a \"fluke.\"\n\nDecide to try the job ads route. Apply for every job that contains the words sales or leader and see what happens. Spoiler alert: not much. Speak to your recruiter friend and have them tell you that the companies you're applying with all use keyword tools and minimum education requirements to rule out applicants within a few minutes of applying. Realize your limited education from an unknown school won't do you much good.\n\nGo back to that empty writing template. Keep writing. Write about how the process makes you feel. Find one lesson that might help someone in the same situation. Finish writing after an hour and then go watch a classic show like \"Game of Thrones.\" Add in salted potato chips and tea for good measure. Keep smiling despite your unemployment status.\n\nReceive a message from your mother who now lives far away. Realize you miss her because she taught you how to teach others. Remember the way she used to pick you up from late-night parties and allowed you to live free growing up. Decide to drag your butt down to go and visit her. Have her make your favorite lunch and ask you, \"How's work?\"\n\nLie to her because you don't know how to explain that you lost your job. Smile and tell her you're doing fine even though you're not. Take the long drive home through oceans, farmland, and roads that are straight for miles.\n\nFeel how relaxing driving can be when your ego has gone from a 90/100 to a solid 40/100. Come home from the long drive, sit down, and write for an hour. Disconnect from judging what you wrote and be happy with whatever came out. At least something came out.\n\nHave your former colleagues message you and tell you how sh-tty their careers are because of the chaos they're enduring. See a tiny glimmer of hope in that fact. Consider for a second if losing your job is useful. Close your computer and go to bed. Sleep in and try to relax. Losing your job takes a mental toll on the mind the longer it goes on for.\n\nWake up the next day feeling fresh. Feel optimistic for once about your employment status. Go to the computer, write, disconnect, and hit publish on a few articles. Log in a few hours later and see one of your stories blow up. Be grateful, humble, and at peace with the result. Don't analyze it, reflect on it, or be tempted to keep checking your stats. Realize that today is a good day in a string of long days ahead.\n\nOpen your email the following morning. Have several rejection emails sitting in your inbox for jobs that you would have qualified for earlier in your career without an interview. Try not to let the rejection stop you from sitting at your computer and writing.\n\nPut on your shoes, go for a walk around the neighborhood, and get a berry smoothie even though you have no funds coming into your bank account other than what you make from writing, which seems tiny in comparison to your old 9\u20135. At least you're not broke, thanks to some careful saving during the good times.\n\nCome home from your walk and try to write at least one article. Find yourself writing six articles for no reason. Don't analyze it. Let it be.\n\nSpend the next few weeks doing job interviews thanks to many kind people doing introductions for you. Have a few of them go really well and tell yourself you'll be back at work before you know it. Attend the interviews, show your true self, share your experiences, and be genuine. Remember to dress up and get a haircut so you look fresh. Have the phone not ring after doing so many interviews. Follow up and get no return phone calls. (Also known as ghosting.)\n\nFind yourself watching a YouTube video about an autistic piano player whose dream is to be a musician and share his music with the world. See a little bit of yourself in that young man. Find yourself crying uncontrollably for no reason at all in the joy and simultaneous pain that thought brings. Have a mentor in your career invite you to an event. Forget to ask the location, time, and attire for the event. Message them the day before and get no response.\n\nWake up the next day to a text message with the meeting place. Try to save money by catching the bus to the meeting place. Get to the bus stop and realize there's roadwork that's going to make you late. Open the Uber app and order one even though you're unemployed. Drive to the meeting place, hoping it's not too far away. Thank the driver and go upstairs to meet your mentor. Have them tell you what's on for the afternoon.\n\nGo down to the lobby of the hotel and have a fancy, black chauffeur car roll up to take you to the event. Notice the contrast between where you are right now and where you could be. Arrive at the event on time. Be introduced to the organizers and a few attendees who all ask one question: \"What do you do with yourself?\"\n\nHave this question haunt you and give them some vague reply that hides the truth: you lost your job and stay at home writing every day. Sit in the front of the audience and watch your mentor give a speech. Have him share his epic battle with cancer in a heartfelt presentation to the audience. Watch the tears in his eyes as he tells this story on repeat like \"Groundhog Day.\" Notice the big, stocky real estate agent next to you crying his eyes out.\n\nWatch the tears roll down your own cheek as you realize that your mentor's battle with cancer is significantly harder than your current struggle of being unemployed.\n\nGet home later that night feeling a little different. Write about your experience and share the fact that you got emotional. Have a couple of people read what you wrote and be influenced by it. Say thank you. Wake up the next day and do something stupid: look up your colleagues on social media. See them all winning and having the time of their lives while you sit at home and write about your experience and whatever books you're currently reading.\n\nAfter a couple of months of not being able to find a job, notice your routine becoming incredibly simplified: coffee, writing, editing, and searching for a job. While writing, find some music that you can listen to, which helps you feel energized. Let the music change your state and help you to forget about your unemployment status and lack of career prospects. Write about whatever you can. Put your heart into the words you write, and most of all, be helpful.\n\nStart to notice a shift in yourself from looking for a job to writing. Be OK with this fact. Check your bank account and see a few thousand dollars get deposited thanks to your writing. Use that money to pay the rent and save the rest. Go back to your writing, realizing that you may be doing something that has value. Write on Mondays and write on the weekend. Write whenever you can and be consistent above all else. Do your best to feel optimistic when you write so you don't write trash and are able to be useful.\n\nBe OK on the days when you don't feel OK. Accept it. Talk about it with your former boss \u2014 don't complain. Have some days be good and some days be bad. Accept all the days of your unemployment. Continue to find creative ways to find new career opportunities and write in-between the gaps of waiting to hear back and the scheduled interviews.\n\nHave an old client of yours introduce you to a mate who is making $500,000 a year in their current job. Pass it off as something you won't be able to do in your current state. Meet them for coffee. Come back the following week to train his colleague on how to write for the internet even though you feel like it's obvious: you write. Have them tell this new mate that your tips were useful.\n\nHave this new connection lead you to another lead and another lead after that. Have that lead ask you to do an interview. Do the interview and not hear back. Wait. Wait some more. Get a yes. Make it to the next round of interviews. Pass with flying colors. Find yourself saying in your head that it's only a matter of time before people realize you're an unemployed writer.\n\nThat same week, write something and have it be viewed by more than a million people. Have your potential new colleagues see it and be impressed. Get a letter of offer for your new career that can be structured around your writing. Sign the letter of offer, start your new job, and continue writing. Use what you learned from losing your job and everything you see on a daily basis at your new job to help you come up with writing ideas.\n\nCheck your bank account and see a deposit for $20,000. Realize that as a part-time writer, you're now making six figures and did so in 12 months.\n\nUnderstand that you did so by writing on the good days and the bad days. It was patience, perseverance, and doing the work that you got there. Be helpful and selfless, and you'll make money from writing. Don't forget to thank the people who helped you along the way, and be humble, not a jerk, when you make six-figures.", "description": "Tim Denning has made six figures from writing in the past 12 months.
