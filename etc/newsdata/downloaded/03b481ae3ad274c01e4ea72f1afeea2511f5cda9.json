In a new cost analysis, Charles Blahous, formerly a member of the Medicare board of trustees, concludes that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill (S. 1804) would cost a breathtaking $32.6 trillion over 10 years.\n\nGiven the growing commitment of House and Senate Democrats to this agenda, Blahous\u2019 analysis is timely. His assessment of the federal government\u2019s financial burden is also consistent with two other independent analyses.\n\nTwo years ago, the Urban Institute, a highly respected liberal think tank, estimated the total cost of the Sanders proposal at $32 trillion over 10 years, and professor Kenneth Thorpe of Emory University, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton, estimated the cost at $24.7 trillion.\n\nIn both cases, the analysts estimated that the level of taxpayer funding would be much higher than Sanders and his colleagues assumed.\n\nCentral Control\n\nCo-sponsored by 16 leading Senate Democrats\u2014including Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Cory Booker of New Jersey\u2014the Sanders bill is the quintessential prescription for comprehensive government-controlled health care.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, 123 Democratic members, more than half of the House Democratic Caucus, have co-sponsored similar legislation (H.R. 676).\n\nThe Sanders bill would create a national health insurance program; prohibit all Americans from having a private or employer-based health insurance plan; and abolish Medicare and Medicaid, absorbing their functions into the new national health insurance scheme.\n\nThe bill would mandate that doctors, hospitals, and medical professionals be paid Medicare payment rates, and would restrict private agreements between doctors and patients outside of the national system.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe $32.6 trillion in additional federal spending (2022 to 2031) alone would equal 10.7 percent of the national economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, and would rise to 12.7 percent of GDP by 2031.\n\nBlahous grants Sanders and his Senate co-sponsors the benefit of the doubt. His estimates assume that their bill would be successful in reducing revenues going to doctors, hospitals, and other medical professionals. He also assumes that their legislation would achieve its goals of reducing the cost of prescription drugs as well as administrative costs.\n\nBlahous cautions, however, that drugs account for only 10 percent of total national health expenditures, and the bill\u2019s intention to replace brand names with generics would take effect within a market where generics already make up 85 percent of drugs sold.\n\nUncertain Savings\n\nConcerning administrative costs, the replacement of private insurance with a single government program would, in theory, secure major administrative cost reductions. For the sake of his estimates, Blahous projects a substantial 7 percent reduction in administrative costs.\n\nThere are, he warns, methodological problems in simple comparisons between Medicare and private-sector administrative costs.\n\nMoreover, the major government programs are plagued by persistent administrative failures that routinely jack up administrative costs. Medicare and Medicaid, for example, racked up an estimated $96 billion in improper payments in 2016 alone.\n\n\u201cAlthough government also polices fraud within its health insurance programs,\u201d Blahous observes, \u201cfinancial survival and business competitiveness are concerns from which government-provided insurance is generally exempt.\u201d\n\nEven assuming gains from reductions in administrative costs, drugs, and the big reductions in provider payments, other features of the legislation, such as the abolition of all cost-sharing, would drive the costs of the program upward.\n\nHuge Taxes\n\nTaxpayers would face enormous burdens, assuming Congress enacted and the president signed the Sanders bill. In his earlier analysis, Thorpe estimated that those taxes would amount to 20 percent of payroll, and roughly 70 percent of working households would pay more than they do today.\n\nFor his part, Blahous says that the costs would be such that \u201cdoubling all federal individual and corporate income taxes going forward would be insufficient to fully finance the plan, even under the assumption that provider payment rates are reduced by over 40 percent for treatment of patients now covered by private insurance. Such an increase in the scope of the federal government operations would precipitate a correspondingly large increase in federal taxation or debt and would be unprecedented if undertaken as an enduring commitment.\u201d\n\nThe promise of \u201csomething for nothing\u201d is always appealing, but it\u2019s never cheap.", "description": "Socialism is expensive.
