It used to supply coal to Eskom, but has not been operational for some time. Employees last received salaries in November 2018\n\nLurco was established in 2010 by businessmen Ellington Nxumalo and Aubrey Chauke. One of its largest projects is a coal beneficiation contract with Australian miner South32.\n\nLurco has until later this week to settle the R500m bid. Louis Klopper, the business rescue practitioner tasked with dealing with some of the Gupta companies, told Netwerk24 that a foreign-owned financier, who is supporting Lurco\u2019s bid, has transferred a part of the money last week. The rest needs to be settled by 24 October.\n\nIf that doesn't happen, another company, Black Royalty Minerals (BRM), will buy Koornfontein. It already has the funds available, but Koornfontein's creditors voted for Lurco because its bid was higher.\n\nKlopper said that the business rescue plan for Optimum, another Gupta-owned mine, will be published before the end of the month, whereafter creditors will get to vote on it. He told Netwerk24 that they expect resistance from Oakbay, and won't be surprised if the company applied for an interdict against the plan.\n\nIn August, the Pretoria High Court dismissed an application by Oakbay to remove the business rescue practitioners of Tegeta.", "description": "Lurco has until Thursday to settle the R500m bid.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4035/099ad4e4f2504e02a0b8c4fbf5ae0fbc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
