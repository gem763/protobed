He will not be the last. He is one of many to do so.\n\nBut when it\u2019s Manny Diaz demanding absolute loyalty from his recruits mere months after he showed the exact opposite to Temple, that deserves to raise more than a few eyebrows.\n\nManny Diaz wants players to do the opposite of what he did\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nA profile from Manny Navarro of The Athletic shed some light on Diaz\u2019s recruiting practices, and one account from Miami commit Marcus Clarke on how Diaz handles his players sure sounds rich given how Diaz left Temple.\n\nFrom The Athletic:\n\n\u201cHe told me once I\u2019m fully committed, he didn\u2019t want me to take any more (official) visits because Miami is the place to be and no other place is really worth visiting if you really want to be committed to the new Miami,\u201d Clarke said Tuesday night. \u201cI was kind of shocked. \u2026 Usually coaches are like, \u2018Go ahead and take your visits because you don\u2019t get a lot of them.\u2019 I do kind of feel like I still want to take my visits. I\u2019m still thinking about it right now. But I do just want to stay humble to Miami. So, I want to see (the next) game, see how it goes.\u201d\n\nAs you might remember, Diaz was named the head coach at Temple last December after a strong three-season stint as the defensive coordinator at Miami. He signed a contract, held a news conference and started recruiting players.\n\nAnd then Miami head coach Mark Richt retired.\n\nDiaz, who was born and raised in Miami and is the son of the city\u2019s mayor, was the obvious choice to take the open position. Despite his commitment to Temple, Diaz was reported to have taken the job just 17 days after his introduction at Temple.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo with that background, you might wonder why Diaz would be demanding stuff like this from his commits:\n\n\u201cWe all went inside the meeting and Coach Diaz was talking to us and he went over that,\u201d Restrepo said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really want anybody to take official visits and be in contact with other colleges because at the end of the day, if you\u2019re committed, you should be 100 percent committed. \u201cLike Coach Diaz said, you\u2019re either going to be with Miami kicking tails or you\u2019re going to go against Miami and get your tail kicked.\u201d\n\nGranted, Diaz left Temple for what was by all accounts his dream job. But the same can be true for his recruits.\n\nWhat if their dream school comes knocking? Should they really be forbidden from at least hearing out a potentially better opportunity than the 0-2 Hurricanes, lest they risk their offer being pulled? And couldn\u2019t this all be self-defeating if you\u2019re immediately surrendering all the recruits who are even talking to top programs and keeping players who you prevented from evaluating as many options as possible?\n\nWhatever happens at Miami, Manny Diaz probably has another job in football waiting for him in the future. His players don't have the same safety net.

It\u2019s a power dynamic that has existed for decades, and has become only more blatant as coach income goes up and player income stays in the same place.\n\nBetween Diaz\u2019s offseason and his current demands, he might be the prime example of this hypocrisy upon which modern college football has been built. And yet he\u2019s still complaining about today\u2019s world of recruiting:\n\n\u201cIf we all love this great football program, we should not let others defile it, in my opinion,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cAnd for whatever reason, that\u2019s happened too often in recruiting in the last few years and that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re really trying to change and stamp out and make these young men in South Florida understand.\u201d\n\nDiaz might want to worry more about what Florida and UNC have done to defile his program this season instead.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "If only Temple had insisted on a similar pledge from Manny Diaz.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/a1ADoBK0YzT6sQYkOFnknA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jWmAFSB0XUFQno1zk5yZbA--~B/aD0zMTcxO3c9NDc1NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/a02b2fa0-d5c1-11e9-acf4-427d72c2a21c", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
