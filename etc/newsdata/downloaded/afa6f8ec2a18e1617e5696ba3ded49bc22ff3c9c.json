He urged people to get vaccinated, especially as school starts up again.\n\nCity officials said 654 people have been diagnosed with measles since the outbreak began in October. The outbreak was concentrated in ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn, including South Williamsburg and Midwood. It was the largest outbreak in the country and was part of the worst nationwide since 1992, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn April the city undertook an outreach campaign to urge people to vaccinate their children, spending more than $6 million. As part of the emergency order, city officials also checked vaccination records of adults and children who were in contact with patients infected with measles, and those who didn\u2019t receive the MMR vaccine and refused vaccination faced $1,000 fines.\n\nOfficials issued 232 violations, but more than half were dismissed after the individual either received the vaccination or proved immunization, according to the New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene. Only 29 fines were issued.\n\nThe city also closed 12 schools during the outbreak, which have all since reopened, and issued violations to 19 other schools and 85 day-care programs.\n\nA New York state law passed in June also ended religious exemptions for school vaccinations.\n\nWrite to Katie Honan at Katie.Honan@wsj.com", "description": "New York City\u2019s measles outbreak is over, health officials said, as a public-health emergency order was lifted.", "authors": ["Katie Honan", "Katie.Honan Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103536/social"}
