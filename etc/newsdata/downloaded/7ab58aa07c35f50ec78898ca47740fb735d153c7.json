The New York Jets quarterback uttered the phrase nine days before Halloween, and in Jacksonville on Sunday the Jaguars faithful ran with the spirited situation.\n\nThere was a mascot in costume, a pre-game sky writing and a few \u201cBOO!\u201d chants in the works. The stadium even played the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d theme song at the two-minute warning while airing his three interceptions in the 29-15 loss.\n\n[Watch NFL games on your phone for FREE with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDarnold kept his cool after the game as he did in the aftermath while the Jets were up in arms about any player being mic\u2019d up in the future. The second-year player was quite frank when addressing the ghosts in Jacksonville. Via the New York Post:\n\n\u201cIt is what it is. It didn\u2019t affect me,\u201d Darnold said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a silly thing for social media and fans to be able to try to use it against you. But for me, I was just playing bad because I did. I just wasn\u2019t executing out there, I wasn\u2019t putting the balls where they needed to be and \u2014 it wasn\u2019t about that, though.\u201d\n\nDarnold, 22, missed a golden opportunity to lean into the situation with the \u201cI blame myself\u201d reference.\n\nHe has seven interceptions and two fumbles over the past two games against the Jaguars and New England Patriots, telling reporters it was \u201ctwo of my worst games ever.\u201d Though the issues lie on the Jets more than Darnold.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe team\u2019s lone victory is against the Dallas Cowboys, in which Darnold threw for 338 yards, two touchdowns and one interception after returning from mononucleosis and its complications. He was sacked only twice that game, a stark comparison to the eight times he was taken down by the Jacksonville defense. He was also hit 13 times by the Jags.\n\nTo make matters worse, head coach Adam Gase told reporters after the game his quarterback sprained his thumb. It\u2019s becoming a mighty long, frustrating saga for New York City.\n\nSam Darnold struggled again against the Jacksonville Jaguars amid many ghosts in the stadium. (AP Photo/Stephen B.
