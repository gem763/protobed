In the 1980s every child learned at school that race was a construct that fascists had used to justify segregating and killing people. So if race didn\u2019t exist, it naturally followed that racism didn\u2019t exist either. If you wanted to talk about it people looked at you as if you were the Nazi.\n\nAll this is changing. It is dizzying to watch my motherland grapple with the concept of race. And, to be honest, to grapple with it myself because when you stop speaking about something you stop thinking about it eventually too. So we\u2019re all walking on eggshells; the discussion about racism is on the agenda but we\u2019re whispering \u201crace\u201d as if it were a dirty word. Except for members of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, the far-right party, who keep pushing the boundaries of what you can and can\u2019t say, and at every opportunity tout their worries about \u201cother races\u201d outbreeding white Germans. Germans of colour, meanwhile, worry about the AfD\u2019s success in winning a quarter of the votes in recent state elections in Saxony and Brandenburg.\n\nThe AfD is gaining strength in Germany. A reformed EU can stop it | Titus Molkenbur and Luke Cooper Read more\n\nBy the way, the German term for people of colour is: people of colour. We really haven\u2019t got a language for it. When my father came from India to Germany in the 1960s he was called a Gastarbeiter, which translates as \u201cguest worker\u201d. Now, you wouldn\u2019t ask your guests to work, and I wouldn\u2019t, but the German government did. The idea was that people would come, they would do the jobs Germans didn\u2019t want to do, and then they would go home.\n\nIn the 1980s these people had been living and working in Germany for decades and it was clear they weren\u2019t going anywhere, so they became: foreigners. I became a foreigner, even though I was born in Germany. In the 1990s we became immigrants, even though \u2026 see above. The term immigrant later became shortened to migrant and then lengthened again to: person with a background of migration. For the first time the term made sense. Kind of. My father and my maternal grandparents migrated into Germany. But so did my husband. Yet nobody describes him in such terms because he\u2019s a white Englishman.\n\nRace does play a role in these difficult negotiations. This is exacerbated by the fact that German nationality law was based on the principle of jus sanguinis (\u201cthe right of blood\u201d), meaning that you had to have German blood \u2013 or more specifically a German father \u2013 to be German. In 1975 the women\u2019s movement won the right for German mothers to transmit their nationality to their children. But it wasn\u2019t until 2000 that some children born and raised in Germany got the right to a German passport. Only in 2014 was the right extended to all German-born children.\n\nImmediately the AfD claimed that we might have German passports but we would never be \u201creal\u201d Germans because we lacked that certain German essence \u2013 blood? \u2013 that would make us part of the Heimat. Sadly, I can\u2019t translate Heimat as it is the unicorn of political language, (and a difficult term for many because it was used during the Nazi era) combining homeland, nation and identity in a mythical way.\n\nSo it was only a question of time before, last year, we got a unicorn ministry: the Heimatministerium, or federal homeland ministry. The freshly baked homeland minister, Horst Seehofer, did not belong to the AfD but to the governing CDU/CSU, yet still his first declaration was: \u201cIslam does not belong to Germany.\u201d Another way of telling millions of Germans that they didn\u2019t belong here.\n\nNone of this is new. What is new is that it doesn\u2019t go unchallenged any more. The populist propaganda that crime is being imported wholesale into Germany (especially sexual crime or the dark men raping white women trope) by \u201cothers\u201d is now broadly contested on the basis that crime rates are actually falling in Germany. In fact, the people at highest risk of attack are women wearing hijabs. Seehofer was forced to add anti-Muslim hate crimes to the list of crimes his ministry evaluates statistically.\n\nAt the beginning of this month, Angela Merkel urged parliament to stand up against Fremdenfeindlichkeit, hatred of foreigners. This is great, only most people on the receiving end of hatred aren\u2019t foreigners. They just happen to be brown or black or to have names like Muhammed or Mithu.\n\nThe idea that you don\u2019t have to acquire German blood vampiristically but can achieve Germanness by \u2026 well, being German, is still new to us. All of us. We don\u2019t call ourselves \u201cpeople with a background of migration\u201d any longer, we call ourselves \u201cGerman plus\u201d or \u201cnew Germans\u201d or sometimes just Germans. And it feels weird. Because all our lives, we have been trained to view ourselves as other.\n\nIn response to the creation of the homeland ministry, 14 German Jewish and writers of colour, including myself, put together an anthology (inspired by the British Good Immigrant project) called Eure Heimat ist Unser Albtraum (Your Homeland is our Nightmare), which has kept a constructive debate going. To be fair, racism in Germany isn\u2019t, in my experience, as blatant as it is in Britain. But there is also a lot less knowledge of it. When I go to England, sooner or later, somebody will remind me about the British empire. How could I forget? In Germany hardly anybody knows that we were dab hands at colonialism as well. We cling to the idea that we were too late to the game and anyway lost the colonies we supposedly didn\u2019t have after the first world war.\n\nGerman president asks Poland for forgiveness at WW2 ceremony Read more\n\nBut most of all we learn that we have already faced up to our past. That we are Weltmeisters in Erinnerungskultur, world champions in the politics of remembering, because we owned up to the crimes of the Nazis. And this is pretty special compared to other nations, even though it wasn\u2019t as voluntary as we like to make out. And it is only part of the story. When we speak about concentration camps we should also know that we built the first concentration camp in 1904, in what is now Namibia, to intern and kill thousands of Herero and Nama people whose bodies were then sent to Berlin to be examined for racial research.\n\nLast year, some of their skulls were given back to descendants in a ceremony that wasn\u2019t an official apology for the genocide. It was, at least, an unofficial one.\n\nIt feels like more books about race have been published in the past two years in Germany than in the past two decades. We even have a sister hashtag to #metoo: #metwo for the experiences of people with more than one Heimat. Reading about all this can create the impression there is more racism than ever in Germany. Actually, the opposite is true. What\u2019s happened is we are finally starting to talk about it.\n\n\u2022 Mithu Sanyal is an author, academic and broadcaster based in Dusseldorf.
