Barring the transparent creepiness, the locality is infested with black cats and the cleaning-man wears clown pants!\n\n\"The room was clean enough and the staff was friendly.\"\n\nHow to book a stay:\n\nThe motel is located in Nevada, on 521 N. Main Street, Tonopah. You can book a room by calling +1 775-482-5920 or clicking here.\n\nThe easiest way to reach Nevada from the UK is to fly into Las Vegas.
