The Blue Peacock.\n\nA 7 metric ton nuclear landmine codenamed \"Blue Peacock\" at the National Records Office in London, March 31, 2004. Getty Images/Staff\n\nLand mines are a dangerous, tricky business for a couple of reasons. The first is that they're hidden, of course, and no one knows where they are until it's too late. With the Blue Peacock, \"too late\" came with a lot of baggage \u2013 8 to 10 kilotons worth.\n\nIn the Cold War, everyone wanted their special atomic weapon, it seemed. For the British, that came in the form of denying the Soviets an area to occupy in the event of World War III. Blue Peacock was a large atomic weapon that would have been buried in areas around Northern Germany and set to trigger if someone opened the casing or if it filled with water.\n\nThe idea was for the bomb to be left unattended, so on top of its itchy trigger finger, it could be set off with an eight-day timer or just detonated by wire. What's truly silly about this weapon is that British engineers didn't know how to address the extreme cold of the North German Plain, so their plan was to either wrap the bombs in blankets or keep live chickens with them to keep them warm.", "description": "During the Cold War, both sides raced to build weapons that would give them an edge.
