And for every 2.6 years of play, the risk of developing CTE doubles. These new findings from an analysis of 266 deceased former amateur and professional football players\u2014reported in Annals of Neurology by a team of researchers from the Boston University CTE Center\u2014are the first to quantify the strength of the link between playing tackle football and developing CTE.\n\nThese findings, made possible by the large number of families who allowed the brains of their relatives to be analyzed for the research, convinced researchers that the length of time one plays tackle football can lead to a rise in CTE.\n\n\u201cThis study is a testament to the hundreds of families who have donated their loved one\u2019s brain. \u2026 It is only because of this support that we can confidently estimate the strength of the relationship between duration of [football] play and risk of CTE,\u201d Neurologist and CTE Center Director Dr. Ann McKee, said in a statement.\n\nIt\u2019s these findings that led the Concussion Legacy Foundation, a non-profit \u201ccommitted to protecting athletes and families through research, policy, and education,\u201d to create the ad comparing tackle football to smoking.\n\nAccording to Sporting News, \u201cThe ad is part of the Concussion Legacy Foundation\u2019s \u201cTackle Can Wait\u201d campaign that has the goal of children younger than 14 playing flag football instead of full-contact tackle football, leaning on its claim (backed by the new study) that kids who start playing tackle football at the age of 5 have 10 times the risk of developing CTE compared to those who wait until they\u2019re 14.\u201d\n\nAccording to recent survey of sports participation in America, youth and high school football participation was found to have only increased in three states (Texas, California, and Minnesota) from last year. States such as California and Massachusetts have either introduced legislation to ban youth football, or are seriously considering doing so.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "A new public service announcement is taking a direct shot at youth tackle football, by claiming that participating in the sport is \"just like", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Mark-Schiefelbein-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
