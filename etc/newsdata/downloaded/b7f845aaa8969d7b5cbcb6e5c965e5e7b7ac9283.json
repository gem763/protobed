They are chatting about movies.\n\nMartin Scorsese comes first, then Al Pacino, then Robert De Niro. They\u2019re trailed by a small army of publicists and assistants that quickly recedes out of the room. Constant through the momentary commotion is Scorsese enthusiastically remembering Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger\u2019s \u201cA Matter of Life and Death,\u201d and quoting its lines to a rapt Pacino.\n\nTheir movie, \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d also deals majestically with matters of life and death. Like Powell and Pressburger\u2019s time-traversing afterlife fantasy, \u201cThe Irishman\u201d takes the long view on a life, albeit one - that of mafia hitman and Jimmy Hoffa associate Frank Sheeran (De Niro) - less certain to stand up in final judgment.\n\nIn Scorsese\u2019s solemnly operatic crime epic, time is one of the three-and-half-hour film\u2019s principle subjects. And in a conversation filled with reflections of the past and uncertainty about the future, time is much on the minds of its power trio. \u201cThe Irishman\u201d was made by 70-something Hollywood legends acutely aware that they have only so much of it left.\n\n\u201cAs they say in the movie, it\u2019s gonna happen. We\u2019re all human. We\u2019re gonna die,\u201d says Scorsese. \u201cThe contemplative nature of it has to do with an accumulation of detail. Details, details. It\u2019s a good thing for our culture to be able to take the time and experience it. You may like it, you may dislike it. But things move so fast now. We see the result of that in what\u2019s happened to our country. We get a soundbite without context. People are too busy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to take time.\u201d\n\nAnd it took ages to get Pacino, De Niro and Scorsese together. \u201cThe Irishman\u201d is their first film as a threesome. That alone gives the film the feel of a historic occasion. A last stand. Their collective response to a movie world where Scorsese\u2019s kind of cinema is increasingly extinct, where three-plus hour movies are usually reserved only for Marvel.\n\n\u201cThe Irishman\u201d was pushed from the start by De Niro. He was attracted to Charles Brandt\u2019s book about Sheeran, \u201cI Heard You Paint Houses,\u201d and saw in it the potential to give a more ruminative spin on the organized crime genre that he, Scorsese and Joe Pesci (who plays Mafia don Russell Bufalino) are so intertwined with. It took more than a decade to make it happen, and only then did it get traction thanks to improving digital de-aging effects that stretch the actors\u2019 performances across decades, and because of Netflix\u2019s backing of a film that ultimately cost $159 million to make.\n\nBut, for them, the long wait was worth it.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have asked for anything more. Period. That\u2019s it,\u201d says De Niro.\n\n\u201cIt really was an exceptional kind of situation. It was funny. Marty, there, Bob. It was so easy. It\u2019s what we do,\u201d agrees Pacino.\n\nTheir names ring out with a phonetic symmetry but it would be hard to find three more rhythmically different people. Scorsese\u2019s ferocious verbosity hasn\u2019t dimmed even slightly with age. Pacino, ever-eager to improvise, is more prone to slapdash riffing. De Niro is, as per his reputation, more taciturn. But the main thing they had in common on a recent fall day, shortly after \u201cThe Irishman\u201d earned ecstatic reviews at the New York Film Festival , was a simple joy at being together. They look like aged robbers who just pulled off the heist of their lives.\n\nScorsese and De Niro, of course, have a long-running collaboration numbering nine feature films. But it\u2019s been a while, 24 years since \u201cCasino.\u201d And Pacino has, despite the odds, never made a film with Scorsese. He compares the experience to walking a high wire \u201conly Marty was the net.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve been close to working together before.\n\n\u201cAl, I always wanted to work with. We met through Francis Coppola,\u201d says Scorsese. \u201cBy the time other projects came up, I didn\u2019t have the cachet, or certain types of stories, you had already covered the territory, like in \u2018Scarface\u2019 or \u2018Carlito\u2019s Way.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big one I wanted to do - there was a lot of them - was the Modigliani,\u201d says Pacino, referring to an unmade biopic on the Jewish-Italian painter and sculptor.\n\nScorsese grants that that script was good, but he reminds Pacino that he spent much of the 1980s struggling to find studios to support him.\n\n\u201cWhat happened is that the whole industry changed,\u201d says Scorsese. \u201cWe opened \u2018Raging Bull\u2019 nine or ten days before the same studio, UA, released \u2018Heaven\u2019s Gate.\u2019 And then \u2018Heaven\u2019s Gate\u2019 was closed by one review from The New York Times and that was the end of what\u2019s derogatorily, unfortunately, referred to as the \u2018auteur\u2019 cinema of America. It was destroyed.\u201d\n\nScorsese goes on to recall the difficulty he had in getting \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d made. It was initially canceled a few weeks before shooting was to start. \u201cI took that as a voice shouting out to me, \u2018Leave Los Angeles!\u2019 So I came back to New York and started over again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw that at the Ziegfeld. Amazing!\u201d says Pacino. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the Ziegfeld anymore.\u201d\n\nThe loss of the grand midtown movie palace is far from the only thing that\u2019s changed for filmmaking in the intervening years. \u201cThe Irishman\u201d is Scorsese\u2019s second film this year with Netflix and, as he has repeatedly proclaimed, they were the only ones willing to pay for it. His consternation with an increasingly blockbuster-dominated Hollywood has been a focal point in the release of \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d drawing the movie into a wider debate about today\u2019s movie landscape .\n\nScorsese\u2019s strongest belief is that cinema should be about more than placating fans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been about servicing the audience and not challenging them. Challenging a bit - maybe more than a bit - enriches the audience. And it enriches our children. Don\u2019t make the audience adolescent or childlike. The audience is ahead of you,\u201d Scorsese says. Pacino and De Niro nod.\n\nNetflix will release \u201cThe Irishman\u201d for a three-week exclusive run in theaters, including showings at Broadway\u2019s Belasco Theatre. It will begin streaming Dec. 1. The movie is expected to be an across-the-board awards contender, giving Netflix another chance at its first best picture winner.\n\n\u201cThe Irishman\u201d is a decidedly more somber and elegiac approach to the gangster film than \u201cGoodFellas\u201d or \u201cCasino,\u201d one that comes out of their own reflections on life. \u201cIt may be in dialogue with those films,\u201d grants Scorsese. \u201c\u2018GoodFellas\u2019 is on one level and \u2018Casino\u2019 takes it another level. And that level ends it, in a way, at the end of \u2018Casino.\u2019 It\u2019s the end of that time and that enthusiasm for that world.\u201d\n\nMore than those films, \u201cThe Irishman\u201d suggests a world outside of lives dedicated to greed, brutality and corruption - a world lost to its characters but not to De Niro, Pacino and Scorsese. When they see each other, they say, their conversation isn\u2019t really much about movies.\n\n\u201cWe talk about our kids,\u201d says De Niro.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about living, really,\u201d says Scorsese.\n\n\u201cAnd: \u2018How do I get a doctor in this city?\u2019\u201d adds Pacino as they all cackle.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the other thing!\u201d Scorsese exclaims. \u201cDoctors, medication. Oh, you\u2019ve got that, too! Oh no!\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "They come into the room not like the moveable Mount Rushmore that they are but like three old friends, energized by being in each other's company.
