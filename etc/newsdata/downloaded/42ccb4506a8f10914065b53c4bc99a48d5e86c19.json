Bolton, President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, according to a person familiar with the notice, but a lawyer for Mr. Bolton responded that he was \u201cnot willing to appear voluntarily.\u201d\n\nThe letter, along with two others sent to top White House officials Wednesday for depositions early next month, took the form of a voluntary request, rather than a subpoena.\n\nIf Mr. Bolton is subpoenaed, his lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, is likely to ask a federal judge to determine whether he needs to comply. Another of Mr. Cooper\u2019s clients \u2014 the former deputy national security adviser, Charles M. Kupperman \u2014 did so when he was subpoenaed by the House but ordered by the White House to not speak with investigators, and a hearing on that matter is scheduled for Thursday.\n\nBased on the accounts of witnesses who have already spoken with investigators, Mr. Bolton could be a marquee witness. They have described how he was alarmed in real time about the actions of Mr. Trump\u2019s private lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and other administration officials close to Mr. Trump. Mr. Bolton left his position in September amid disagreements with Mr. Trump.", "description": "John Bolton, the president\u2019s former national security adviser, has said he will not appear voluntarily.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/us/politics/30dc-impeachbriefing2-promo/30dc-impeachbriefing2-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
