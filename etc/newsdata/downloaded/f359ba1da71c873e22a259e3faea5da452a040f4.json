Supporters say it could ease foreign trade with Europe and Asia when the country\u2019s economy is targeted by U.S. penalties aimed at its isolation.\n\nHardline opponents argue that passing legislation toward joining the FATF, could hamper Iran\u2019s support for its allies, including Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah.\n\nThe chances of Iranian compliance within four months appeared slim. Its own action plan to meet with the FATF requirements, implemented in 2016, expired in January 2018.\n\n\u201cThe FATF expresses its disappointment that the Action Plan remains outstanding,\u201d it said. \u201cThe FATF expects Iran to proceed swiftly in the reform path to ensure that it addresses all of the remaining items by completing and implementing the necessary Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing reforms.\u201d", "description": "A global dirty money watchdog said on Friday it had given Iran a final deadline of February 2020 to comply with international norms after which it would urge all its members to apply counter-measures.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
