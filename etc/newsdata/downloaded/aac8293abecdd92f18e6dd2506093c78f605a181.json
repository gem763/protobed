(AP) - Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner thinks manager Aaron Boone has New York ready for the postseason after an unprecedented run of injuries.\n\nNew York won the AL East for the first time since 2012 and will open the playoffs in the Division Series at home on Oct. 4, likely against Minnesota.\n\n\u201cWe faced a significant amount of adversity this year,\u201d Steinbrenner said Thursday after watching a Florida instructional league game. \u201cBoone and the coaching staff, and especially the players, they stayed positive throughout. They had each others\u2019 backs and never gave up. It\u2019s a winning mentality in that clubhouse. A long way to go but we\u2019re going in strong.\u201d\n\nNew York has had 30 players make 39 stints on the injured list, losing Giancarlo Stanton, Aaron Judge, Didi Gregorius, Aaron Hicks, Gary S\u00e1nchez, Miguel And\u00fajar, Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n, Luis Severino and Dellin Betances for extended periods. All but Betances and Hicks are expected to be available for the postseason.\n\n\u201cThere never was a season injury-wise like this,\u201d Steinbrenner said. \u201cNobody had ever seen it before. It just seemed to never end. We\u2019d get a guy back and another guy would go down. All kinds of injuries. Pretty much anything you could think of.\u201d\n\nNew York has 102 wins heading into its final series this weekend at Texas.\n\n\u201cThe team just stayed positive and somebody else came up to fill-in a void and guys took advantage of opportunities that they knew they might otherwise not have,\u201d Steinbrenner said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t ask for more. It\u2019s a tremendous story but we\u2019ve got to see it through.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees have 299 home runs and a record 14 players have hit 10 or more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty fearsome lineup,\u201d Steinbrenner said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some good starters and, of course, we have a great bullpen. We\u2019ve got as good a chance as anybody.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner thinks manager Aaron Boone has New York ready for the postseason after an unprecedented run of injuries.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Didtler"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/yankees_steinbrenner_baseball_79958_c0-277-3300-2201_s1770x1032.jpg?11c88e27b07781c8194c884014eaa9e9983a2e26", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
