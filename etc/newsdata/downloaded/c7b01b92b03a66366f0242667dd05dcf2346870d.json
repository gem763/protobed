However, Brexit Party politicians maintain that even without the backstop, the treaty concedes too much to Brussels and does not deliver Brexit.\n\nSpeaking on the Brexit Party\u2019s BrexBox webcast, James Wells MEP said: \u201cApart from the tweak to the backstop, we still end up with May\u2019s deal warmed up.\u201d\n\nTheresa May\u2019s Brexit treaty, approved by the EU, was rejected three times in the House of Commons. Brexiteers have feared that Johnson\u2019s pursuit of a deal would result in a similar deal being put before MPs a fourth time.\n\nNoting that all of the other aspects of the treaty remain, the MEP for Wales continued: \u201cWe still give away all of our fishing, we still have a two-year transition where there\u2019s still no certainty for businesses, and we still do not know what the deal will be at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nReferencing the \u00a339 billion divorce bill, Mr Wells said: \u201cWe give away huge amounts of money [and] we\u2019re still under the jurisdiction of the ECJ [European Court of Justice].\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is, the actual legally binding part of the withdrawal agreement is exactly the same, virtually.\u201d\n\nEuropean Union Could Bypass Johnson to Delay Brexit https://t.co/YRvf9RsAwa \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 3, 2019\n\nBrexit campaign group Fishing for Leave also said on Wednesday that the new deal \u201cfalls way short of Brexit for British fishing\u201d.\n\nThe group said that under the terms of the deal, the UK would have to obey the EU\u2019s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) \u201cfor up to three-and-a-half years\u201d. This means that the UK would not take back control of her fishing waters on November 1st and European fleets could continue to catch Britain\u2019s fish.\n\n\u201cUnless the Future Relationship is re-written, we\u2019d be pushed into CFP associate membership forever,\u201d they warned.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage warned yesterday: \u201cIt is clear Boris Johnson is going to reheat her dreadful deal.\u201d Later, he remarked that the treaty would leave Britain at the mercy of the EU.\n\nHe said: \u201cBoris only wants to change one part of the Withdrawal Agreement. Despite his words, there is no guarantee that we will leave the Customs Union, and any future trade deal needs good faith from the EU side.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like putting your head in a crocodile\u2019s mouth and hoping for the best.\u201d\n\nMr Farage is opposed to any rehashed May deal or renegotiated treaty with the EU. Backing a no deal Brexit, he said: \u201cAnything less than a Clean-Break Brexit would betray 17.4 million Leave voters.\u201d", "description": "A Brexit Party MEP has said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new Brexit plans are just Theresa May's treaty \"warmed up\".", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/07/Theresa-May-Tory.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
