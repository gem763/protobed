The move leaves Taipei with formal relations with only 16 countries, many of them small, less-developed nations in Central America and the Pacific.\n\nAsked at a budget hearing in the House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs whether any funds would be directed to the Solomon Islands in fiscal 2020, Gloria Steele, acting assistant administrator of USAID\u2019s Asia bureau, replied: \u201cWe are reassessing our assistance to the Solomon Islands at this point.\u201d\n\nSteele did not elaborate, and USAID did not immediately respond to requests for details on current U.S. assistance to the Solomons.\n\nOn Tuesday, another senior U.S. official said Vice President Mike Pence has declined to meet with the leader of the Solomon Islands to discuss development partnerships after it cut ties with Taiwan in favor of China. Solomons Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare had asked Pence in July for a meeting, which was to have taken place on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York next week, or afterward in Washington.\n\n\u201cBut the decision by the Solomon Islands to change its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the People\u2019s Republic of China has consequences. They\u2019re hurting a historically strong relationship by doing this,\u201d the senior U.S. official who spoke on Tuesday said.\n\nThe United States upholds what is known as the \u201cone-China\u201d policy, officially recognizing Beijing and not Taipei, while assisting Taiwan.\n\nBut while working to counter China\u2019s expanding global influence, Washington has criticized countries for switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.\n\nBeijing said on Tuesday that the Solomon Islands would have unprecedented development opportunities after cutting ties with Taiwan.\n\nThe Solomon Islands\u2019 decision followed a months-long review of the pros and cons of a switch to Beijing, which was offering $8.5 million in development funds to replace support from Taiwan.\n\n(This story fixes quote to read assistance, rather than commitment in paragraph three.)", "description": "The United States is reassessing its assistance to the Solomon Islands after the Pacific nation cut ties with Taiwan in favor of China this week, a senior official in the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431357612&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1U7", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
