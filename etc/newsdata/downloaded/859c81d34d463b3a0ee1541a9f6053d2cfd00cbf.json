The tariffs, approved by the World Trade Organization, include 25% duties on goods ranging from French wine to Scotch whisky.\n\nAlthough Pernod Ricard benefited from a share price bounce when it emerged the list excluded blended whiskies, cognac and champagne, the tariff hit will be \"significant\" in the U.S., even though it is limited to single malt Scotch and Spanish wine, Chief Executive Alexandre Ricard told Reuters.\n\nThe group could raise prices to make up for the higher duties, which will hit brands such as Glenlivet and Campo Viejo Spanish wine, he said.\n\nFinance Chief Helene de Tissot told analysts on Thursday that U.S. tariff risk also \"remains a factor\" over the longer term as it is not possible to exclude future changes in the list of products targeted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRST QUARTER MISS\n\nIn August, Pernod Ricard, the world's second-biggest spirits group behind Diageo, indicated it expected a relatively soft first quarter, citing a very high year-ago comparison basis in Asia.\n\nFor the first quarter ended Sept. 30, Pernod reported sales of 2.483 billion euros ($2.75 billion), a like-for-like rise of 1.3%.\n\nThat compared with a growth rate of 10.4% in the year-ago quarter and missed analysts expectations of 3.3 % growth.\n\n\"Q1 appears to have missed on travel retail, down 6%, with most other main markets in line with expectations\" said JP Morgan analysts in a note.\n\nSales growth was 6% in China, compared to 27% in the year-ago quarter, with a notable decline in Chivas whisky sales due to challenging market conditions including the closure of some night clubs.\n\nMartell cognac sales in China benefited from a price rise but sustainable inventory management weighed on volumes, Pernod said.\n\nIts United States arm fared better, making a good start and delivering 6% sales growth in the first quarter. In February, Pernod vowed to lift its margins and shareholder returns under a three-year strategic plan that Elliott has described as a first small step.\n\n($1 = 0.9030 euros) (Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta, Sarah White and Kirsten Donovan)", "description": "France's Pernod Ricard said on Thursday it may raise prices on spirits like Glenlivet Scotch whisky to counter U.S. trade tariffs, at a time when it is also grappling with decelerating growth rates in key markets like China and India.
