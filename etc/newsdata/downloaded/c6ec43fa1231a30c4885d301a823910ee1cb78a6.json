If you want the Multi Mount with all of the accessories, though, it will cost you $144.96, nearly triple of what you\u2019d pay for the no-frills version.", "description": "Earlier this year, Elgato announced a lighting rig that can attach to a desk so YouTube creators, Twitch streamers, and other online content makers can more easily light their home setups.
