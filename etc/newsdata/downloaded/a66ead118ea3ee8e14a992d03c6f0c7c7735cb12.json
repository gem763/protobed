The results did beat analysts\u2019 expectations for a profit of $2.45 a share.\n\nJPMorgan is one of four big Wall Street banks to report their results Tuesday, along with Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. Investors will be looking to see how the nation\u2019s biggest banks fared last quarter, particularly in light of the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and fears that U.S. economic growth is slowing.\n\nChief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement that he believes the U.S. consumer \u201cremains healthy,\u201d but that consumer strength is \u201cbeing offset by weakening business sentiment and capital expenditures, mostly driven by increasingly complex geopolitical risks, including tensions in global trade.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s biggest division, its consumer banking business, reported a 5% rise in quarterly profits from a year ago. That was largely helped by more activity in its home lending business, as well as more people carrying a balance on their credit cards. The bank\u2019s total loans unexpectedly fell in the quarter, down 1%, as JPMorgan said it sold off a chunk of home mortgages. Excluding the sale, the company said loan growth was flat.\n\nProfits in JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank rose 7%, helped unexpectedly by the bank\u2019s trading desks. The slow summer season and market volatility the last few months was expected to weigh on the big banks\u2019 earnings this quarter.\n\nTotal revenue at the bank was $29.34 billion, up from $27.26 billion a year earlier.\n\nJPMorgan shares were up 2% in premarket trading. They are up roughly 19% so far this year.", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 JPMorgan Chase & Co. said Tuesday that its profits grew by 8% in the third quarter, helped partly by higher interest rates and a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/1118a6_earns-chase-30167-bank-consumer-report-credit-report-credit-banks-thursday-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
