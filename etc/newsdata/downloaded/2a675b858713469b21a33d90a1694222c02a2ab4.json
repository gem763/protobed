The items reportedly disappeared between June 21 and Sept. 9. They were a Harry Winston diamond bracelet, a ring, necklace and bracelet - all encrusted with diamonds and sapphires - and a pair of diamond and emerald earrings.\n\nReports of the thefts were first published by the New York Post, which said neither apartment was ransacked and there were no signs of break-ins.\n\nThe newspaper said both incidents are thought to have been inside jobs and it wasn't clear whether a single thief pulled them off. \"It's not somebody breaking into the building or roaming the halls, trying the doors until they find one that's open,\" one source told the Post.\n\nDetectives were compiling a list of everyone with access to the building, the newspaper adds. Insurance fraud isn't suspected.\n\nA police spokesman told The New York Times investigators haven't identified a suspect.\n\nMr. Trump was staying at his Trump Tower penthouse Sunday night and is in his hometown for the United Nations General Assembly meeting this week. He's scheduled to deliver a speech to the body on Tuesday.", "description": "The summer heists are thought to have been inside jobs and police are making a list of everyone who had access to the building, the New York Post says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/08/24/39fa657f-e559-4153-866b-0072a3c49dc2/thumbnail/1200x630g8/2239e2fcef37f0d44a610d015052704e/gettyimages-515179130.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
