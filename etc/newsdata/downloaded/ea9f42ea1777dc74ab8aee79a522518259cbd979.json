He said: \"Many, many congratulations on a wonderful career. I know you`ve tried everything the last few months to get ready. I was thinking of you, I was watching you.\n\n\"I saw the fall as well in the Super-G a few days ago. I was really feeling sorry. I was sitting there with my children and hoping for you. So, I just wanted to say: 'well done'. You can be so, so proud and I hope you can enjoy this moment even though it might be a little bit sad for you now.\"\n\nLindsey showed her delight and made some promises of her own.\n\n\"Rog, you`re the best. man,\" she said.\n\n\"I will come to Wimbledon, so I wanna see a good performance by you and I look forward to being able to go skiing with your children. That`'s gonna be great. I love you, thank you.\"\n\nIt was a memorable end to a great career.", "description": "Vonn takes bronze and is congratulated by Roger Federer", "authors": ["Philip Andrew Churm"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/65/74/38/1000x563_cmsv2_7f550327-b785-57d1-9483-7fb96ca51c83-3657438.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-10"}
