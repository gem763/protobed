It\u2019s where Steve McQueen thundered down Technicolor hills as Bullitt, its gritty streets were cleaned up by Clint Eastwood in the 1970s, and more recently it was (for better or worse) where we met Tom Hardy\u2019s Venom.\n\nIn reality, like many cities, it has been subject to the kind of gentrification that sees the soul of an area left in favour of something more profitable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat change is very much the subject of The Last Black Man In San Francisco, the debut film by Joe Talbot.\n\nTold slowly and with artistic camera flourishes, it tells the story of Jimmie (Jimmie Fails, who wrote the film based on his own experiences), a young man who dreams of getting back the house his grandfather built.\n\nWhen the house is temporarily left uninhabited, Jimmie and his best friend Mont (Jonathan Majors) go on a journey to claim it, despite everybody and everything in the city pushing them away.\n\nJimmie tells his own story (Image: A24)\n\nIn another film, set in another city, the extended slow-motion sequences and operatic soundtrack might seem over-indulgent. However, this is San Francisco, one of the most cinematic cities in America, filmed by someone who understands it.\n\nWhile a more commercially minded film would opt for grainy handheld cameras, this journey unfolds like a visual ballet, marveling at the city\u2019s architecture and stopping to observe the life that the camera passes.\n\nAt one point Fails says about the city: \u2018You don\u2019t get to hate it unless you love it\u2019, and it truly feels as though both the writing and direction come from someone with a complicated relationship with their home town.\n\nThe dialogue beams with pride at the history of those who built San Francisco then shakes with sadness at how those communities have been pushed away. Those mixed emotions ache within the film, creating an authenticity rarely found in modern movies.\n\nJimmie Fails (left) pours his heart into a performance inspired by his own life (image: David Moir / A24)\n\nIt\u2019s impossible not to be won over by the simplicity of Jimmie\u2019s desire. He simply wants a home, something connected to who he is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFails keeps the performance simple, only offering up hints of why he may feel that way. We see it when he helps his aggressive father (Rob Morgan) cut out the covers for pirate DVDs, or have a stilted conversation on the bus with his mother, who he clearly didn\u2019t know was back in town.\n\nAs Mont, Majors is sensitive and quiet, finding inspiration in his friends\u2019 journey even though it tears him from his father (Danny Glover, superb even in a relatively small role). The two stars carve out a gentle friendship that seems more realistic precisely because it\u2019s never showy.\n\nThe film leaves uncomfortable questions hanging from the opening scene, where a white city worker fumigates a street in a hazmat suit, while the black residents watch unprotected.\n\nWe feel the stares the middle-class citizens give Jimmie and Mont, as they look on the remains of apartment blocks that were burned down to push out rent-controlled tenants.\n\nAs artistically as it\u2019s delivered, these everyday injustices are painful to watch. This isn\u2019t hand-wringing liberalism or a call to action. It\u2019s a lament for those whom gentrification displaces.\n\nThe Last Black Man In San Francisco is a stunning late entry for one of the films of 2019.\n\nIt approaches issues that feel of this moment, with a grace that seems timeless. It may get lost in the shuffle as cinemas clog up with expensive sequels, but this wonderful independent drama will reward you for seeking it out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Last Black Man In San Francisco is in UK cinemas 25 October.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
