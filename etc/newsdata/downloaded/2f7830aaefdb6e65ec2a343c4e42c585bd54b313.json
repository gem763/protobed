As they celebrate, Hajduk score in an empty net. https://t.co/QoF95I0QoF \u2014 Aleksandar Holiga (@AlexHoliga) October 26, 2019\n\nIt remained 2-0 to the hosts as they sealed a win which put them top of the table on 27 points from 11 games, two points clear of Dinamo Zagreb but having played two games more.\n\nThe hapless Slaven Belupo sit bottom of the league on goal difference among a group of three teams on 10 points.", "description": "Croatian team Slaven Belupo conceded a goal against Hajduk Split in the most unusual of circumstances when half the team was celebrating \u201ca ghost goal\u201d at the other end of the pitch that had not actually crossed the line.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db48c87203027534d4e7dc4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
