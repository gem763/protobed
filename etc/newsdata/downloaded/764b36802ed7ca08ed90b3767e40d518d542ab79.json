They're on the list for the sixth time this year.\n\nMeanwhile disco legends Chic, who have notched up 11 nominations without a win, didn't make the latest longlist at all.\n\nMore than 1,000 musicians, experts and critics will whittle down the nominees to decide the class of 2020. Fans are also allowed to vote for their favourite act online - with the winner getting one extra \"vote\" in the final ballot.\n\nThe artists they will choose between are:\n\nPat Benatar\n\nDave Matthews Band\n\nDepeche Mode\n\nThe Doobie Brothers\n\nWhitney Houston\n\nJudas Priest\n\nKraftwerk\n\nMC5\n\nMot\u00f6rhead\n\nNine Inch Nails\n\nThe Notorious B.I.G.\n\nRufus featuring Chaka Khan\n\nTodd Rundgren\n\nSoundgarden\n\nT Rex\n\nThin Lizzy\n\nWhitney Houston sold more records and received more awards than almost any other female pop star of the 20th Century.\n\nShe was the first artist ever to have seven consecutive singles hit number one in the US, starting with 1985's Saving All My Love For You; while her 1992 cover of Dolly Parton's I Will Always Love You sold was bought by more than 20 million people worldwide, making it the best-selling song by a female artist of all time.\n\nIf she is inducted to the Hall of Fame in Cleveland next April, she will take her rightful place alongside the biggest stars of the MTV era - Michael Jackson, Madonna and Prince.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
