For a good while he remained on his back (not his favourite posture) and regarded his distant feet, his paucity of limbs, with consternation. A mere four, of course, and quite unmovable. His own little brown legs, for which he was already feeling some nostalgia, would have been waving merrily in the air, however hopelessly. He lay still, determined not to panic. An organ, a slab of slippery meat, lay squat and wet in his mouth \u2013 revolting, especially when it moved of its own accord to explore the vast cavern of his mouth and, he noted with muted alarm, slide across an immensity of teeth. He stared along the length of his body. His colouring, from shoulders to ankles, was a pale blue, with darker blue piping around his neck and wrists, and white buttons in a vertical line right down his unsegmented thorax. The light breeze that blew intermittently across it, bearing a not unattractive odour of decomposing food and grain alcohol, he accepted as his breath. His vision was unhelpfully narrowed \u2013 oh for a compound eye \u2013 and everything he saw was oppressively colourful. He was beginning to understand that by a grotesque reversal his vulnerable flesh now lay outside his skeleton, which was therefore wholly invisible to him. What a comfort it would have been to catch a glimpse of that homely nacreous brown.\n\nAll this was worrying enough, but as he came more fully awake he remembered that he was on an important, solitary mission, though for the moment he could not recall what it was. I\u2019m going to be late, he thought, as he attempted to lift from the pillow a head that must have weighed as much as five kilos. This is so unfair, he told himself. I don\u2019t deserve this. His fragmentary dreams had been deep and wild, haunted by raucous, echoing voices in constant dissent. Only now, as this head slumped back, did he begin to see through to the far side of sleep and bring to mind a mosaic of memories, impressions and intentions that scattered as he tried to hold them down.\n\nYes, he had left the pleasantly decaying Palace of Westminster without even a farewell. That was how it had to be. Secrecy was all. He had known that without being told. But when exactly had he set out? Certainly it was after dark. Last night? The night before? He must have left by the underground car park. He would have passed the polished boots of the policeman at the entrance. Now he remembered. Keeping to the gutter, he had hurried along until he had reached the edge of the terrifying crossing in Parliament Square. In front of a line of idling vehicles impatient to pestle him into the tarmac, he made a dash for the gutter on the far side. After which, it seemed a week passed before he crossed another terrifying road to reach the correct side of Whitehall. Then what? He had sprinted, surely, for many yards and then stopped. Why? It was coming back to him now. Breathing heavily through every tube in his body, he had rested near a wholesome drain to snack on a discarded slice of pizza. He couldn\u2019t eat it all, but he did his best. By good luck it was a margherita. His second favourite. No olives. Not on that portion.\n\nQuick guide Ian McEwan on The Cockroach Show Hide How would you describe The Cockroach? It\u2019s a satirical novella written from that point where despair and laughter meet. What prompted you to write a novella about Brexit? The accumulation of misleading statements and lies made to voters about the benefits of leaving the EU. How quickly and recently did you write the book and did you feel under pressure to update as events unfolded? I wrote The Cockroach during July and August this year. The main facts of this national tragedy were in place. The rest was detail. Was it cathartic to write? Fun, even? A bit of local glee along the way. But longer term, no catharsis, only bafflement and gloom and wonder at the state we\u2019re in.\n\nHow did you hit upon Reversalism \u2013 the crackpot economic theory that the flow of money should be reversed \u2013 as a Brexit analogy? Does it have any basis in real life? I aimed to dream up a nonsensical political project as self-harmingly loony as Brexit. I\u2019m not sure I succeeded. Satire was a powerful tool in the time of Jonathan Swift, but do you believe it can effect real change in our media-saturated 21st century? Swift\u2019s A Modest Proposal didn\u2019t change much. I humbly doubt that my Cockroach will. What do you think will break the Brexit deadlock? When \u201ctake back control\u2019\u201d, \u201cclean break\u201d, \u201cbreaking the shackles\u201d, \u201cstanding alone\u201d etc are understood for the mendacious nonsense they are. What\u2019s the most compelling work that you\u2019ve read, watched or listened to on the subject of Brexit? Most recently, Neal Ascherson and Ferdinand Mount in the LRB symposium of a couple of weeks ago [How bad can it get? Reflections on the state we\u2019re in, August 2019)]. Which work of satire do you most admire? Paul Jennings\u2019s Report on Resistentialism (perhaps I owe a debt).\n\n\n\nHis unmanageable head, he discovered, could rotate through 180 degrees with little effort. He turned it now to one side. It was a small attic bedroom, unpleasantly lit by the morning sun, for the curtains had not been drawn. There was a telephone at his bedside, no, two telephones. His constricted gaze travelled across the carpet to settle on the skirting board and the narrow gap along its lower edge. I might have squeezed under there out of the morning light, he thought sadly. I could have been happy. Across the room there was a sofa and by it, on a low table, a cut-glass tumbler and an empty bottle of scotch. Laid out over an armchair was a suit and a laundered, folded shirt. On a larger table near the window were two box files, one sitting on top of the other, both coloured red.\n\nHe was getting the hang of moving his eyes, now that he understood the way they smoothly swivelled together without his help. Rather than letting his tongue hang out beyond his lips, where it dripped from time to time on to his chest, he found it was more comfortably housed within the oozing confines of his mouth. Horrible. But he was acquiring the knack of steering his new form. He was a quick learner. What troubled him was the need to set about his business. There were important decisions to be taken. Suddenly, a movement on the floor caught his attention. It was a little creature, in his own previous form, no doubt the displaced owner of the body he now inhabited. He watched with a degree of protective interest as the tiny thing struggled over the strands of pile carpet, towards the door. There it hesitated, its twin antennae waving uncertainly with all of a beginner\u2019s ineptitude. Finally, it gathered its courage and stumbled under the door to begin a difficult, perilous descent. It was a long way back to the palace, and there would be much danger along the way. But if it made it without being squashed underfoot, it would find, behind the palace panelling or below the floorboards, safety and solace among millions of its siblings. He wished it well. But now he must attend to his own concerns.\n\nHe was a tiny element in a scheme of a magnitude that no single individual could comprehend\n\nAnd yet Jim did not stir. Nothing made sense, all movement was pointless until he could piece together the journey, the events, that had led him to an unfamiliar bedroom. After that chance meal he had scuttled along, barely conscious of the bustle above him, minding his own business as he hugged the shadows of the gutter, though for how long and how far was beyond recall. What he knew for certain was that he reached at last an obstacle that towered over him, a small mountain of dung, still warm and faintly steaming. Any other time, he would have rejoiced. He regarded himself as something of a connoisseur. He knew how to live well. This particular consignment he could instantly place. Who could mistake that nutty aroma, with hints of petroleum, banana skin and saddle soap. The Horse Guards! But what a mistake, to have eaten between meals. The margherita had left him with no appetite for excrement, however fresh or distinguished, nor any inclination, given his gathering exhaustion, to clamber all the way over it. He crouched in the mountain\u2019s shadow, on the springy ground of its foothills, and considered his options. After a moment\u2019s reflection, it was clear what he must do. He set about scaling the vertical granite wall of the kerb in order to circumvent the heap and descend on its far side.\n\nReclining now in the attic bedroom, he decided that this was the point at which he had parted company with his own free will, or the illusion of it, and had come under the influence of a greater, guiding force. Mounting the pavement, as he did, he submitted to the collective spirit. He was a tiny element in a scheme of a magnitude that no single individual could comprehend.\n\nHe heaved himself on to the top of the kerb, noting that the droppings extended a third of the way across the pavement. Then, out of nowhere, there came down upon him a sudden storm, the thunder of 10,000 feet, and chants and bells, whistles and trumpets. Yet another rowdy demonstration. So late in the evening. Loutish people making trouble when they should have been at home. Nowadays, these protests were staged almost every week. Disrupting vital services, preventing ordinary decent types from going about their lawful business. He froze on the kerb, expecting to be squashed at any moment. The soles of shoes 15 times his own length slammed the ground inches from where he cowered and made his antennae and the pavement tremble. How fortunate for him that at one point he chose to look up, entirely in the spirit of fatalism. He was prepared to die. But that was when he saw an opportunity \u2013 a gap in the procession. The next wave of protesters was 50 yards away. He saw their banners streaming, their flags bearing down, yellow stars on a blue ground. Union Jacks too. He had never scuttled so fast in his life. Breathing hard through all the trachea on his body segments, he gained the other side by a heavy iron gate seconds before they were on him again with thunderclaps of hideous tramping, and now catcalls and savage drumbeats. Seized by mortal fear and indignation, an inconvenient mix, he darted off the pavement and, to save his life, squeezed under the gate into the sanctuary and relative tranquillity of a side street where he instantly recognised the heel of a standard issue policeman\u2019s boot. Reassuring, as ever.\n\nThen what? He proceeded along the empty pavement, past a row of exclusive residences. Here he was surely fulfilling the plan. The collective pheromonal unconscious of his kind bestowed on him an instinctive understanding of his direction of travel. After half an hour of uneventful progress, he paused, as he was meant to do. On the far side of the street was a group of a hundred or so photographers and reporters. On his side, he was level with and close by a door, outside which stood yet another policeman. And just then, that door swung open and a woman in high heels stepped out, almost spearing him right through his ninth and tenth abdominal segments. The door remained open. Perhaps a visitor was arriving. In those few seconds Jim looked into a welcoming, softly lit hallway, with skirting boards somewhat scuffed \u2013 always a good sign. On a sudden impulse that he now knew was not his own, he ran in.\n\nLike many of his kind, he rather fancied himself at the dispatch box. He would be fast on his feet, even though he only had two\n\nHe was doing well, given his unusual circumstances, lying on this unfamiliar bed, to recall such details. It was good to know that his brain, his mind, was much as it had always been. He remained, after all, his essential self. It was the surprising presence of a cat that had caused him to run, not in the direction of the skirting boards, but towards the stairs. He climbed three and looked back. The cat, a brown and white tabby, had not seen him, but Jim considered it dangerous to descend. So began his long climb. On the first floor there were too many people walking along the landing, in and out of rooms. More prospect of being trodden to death. An hour later, when he reached the second floor, the carpets were being vigorously vacuumed. He knew of many souls who had been lost that way, sucked into dusty oblivion. No choice but to keep on climbing until \u2013 but now, suddenly, here in the attic, all his thoughts were obliterated by the harsh ringing of one of the bedside telephones. Even though he found that he could at last move one of his limbs, an arm, he did not stir. He couldn\u2019t trust his voice. And even if he could, what would he say? I\u2019m not who you think I am? After four rings the phone went silent.\n\nHe lay back and allowed his frantic heart to settle. He practised moving his legs. At last, they stirred. But barely an inch. He tried again with an arm, and raised it until it towered far above his head. So, back to the story. He had heaved himself up the last step to arrive breathless on the top landing. He squeezed under the nearest door into a small apartment. Usually, he would have made straight for the kitchen but instead he climbed a bedpost and, utterly depleted, crept under a pillow. He must have slept deeply for \u2013 but now, dammit, there came a tapping sound and before he could respond, the door to the bedroom was opening. A young woman in a beige trouser suit stood on the threshold and gave a brisk nod before entering.\n\n\u201cI tried phoning but I thought I\u2019d better come up. Prime minister, it\u2019s almost 7.30.\u201d\n\nHe could think of no response.\n\nThe woman, clearly an aide of some kind, came into the room and picked up the empty bottle. Her manner was rather too familiar.\n\n\u201cQuite an evening, I see.\u201d\n\nIt would not have done to remain silent for long. From his bed he aimed for an inarticulate sound, somewhere between a groan and a croak. Not bad. Higher pitched than he would have wanted, with a hint of a chirrup, but plausible enough.\n\nThe aide was gesturing towards the larger table, at the red boxes. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you had a chance to, uh\u2026\u201d\n\nHe played it safe by making the same sound again, this time on a lower note.\n\n\u201cPerhaps after breakfast you could take a \u2026 I should remind you. It\u2019s Wednesday. Cabinet at nine. Priorities for government and PMQs at noon.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration by Lehel Kovacs.\n\nPrime Minister\u2019s Questions. How many of those he had crouched through, listening enthralled from behind the rotten wainscoting in the company of a few thousand select acquaintances? How familiar he was with the opposition leader\u2019s shouted questions, the brilliant non sequitur replies, the festive jeers and clever imitations of sheep. It would be a dream come true, to be primo uomo in the weekly operetta. But was he adequately prepared? No less than anyone else, surely. Not after a quick glance at the papers. Like many of his kind, he rather fancied himself at the dispatch box. He would be fast on his feet, even though he only had two.\n\nIn the space where once he sported a fine mandible, the unwholesome slab of dense tissue stirred and his first human word rolled out.\n\n\u201cRighto.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have your coffee ready downstairs.\u201d\n\nHe had often sipped coffee in the dead of night on the tea room floor. It tended to keep him awake in the day, but he enjoyed the taste and preferred it milky, with four sugars. He assumed this was generally known by his staff.\n\nAs soon as the aide had left the room, he pushed away the covers and managed at last to swing his tuberous legs on to the carpet. He stood at last at a vertiginous height, swaying slightly, with his soft, pale hands pressed to his forehead, and groaning again. Minutes later, making his unsteady way towards the bathroom, those same hands began nimbly to remove his pyjamas. He stepped out of them to stand on pleasantly heated tiles. It rather amused him, passing water thunderously into a specially prepared ceramic bowl, and his spirits lifted. But when he turned to confront the mirror over the handbasin, they sank again. The bristling oval disk of a face, wobbling on a thick pink stalk of neck, repelled him. The pinprick eyes shocked him. The inflated rim of darker flesh that framed an array of off-white teeth disgusted him. But I\u2019m here for a proud cause and I\u2019ll put up with anything, he reassured himself as he watched his hands turn the taps and reach for his shaving brush and soap.\n\nFive minutes later he felt nauseated as he paused, still swaying, before the prospect of putting on the clothes laid out for him. His own sort took great pride in their beautiful, gleaming bodies and would never have thought to cover them up. White underpants, black socks, a blue and white striped shirt, dark suit, black shoes. He observed with detachment the automatic speed with which his hands tied his laces, and then, back at the bathroom mirror, his tie. As he combed his gingery brown hair, he noticed with sudden homesickness that it was the same colour as his good old shell. At least something has survived of my looks, was his melancholy thought as, finally, he stood at the top of the stairs.\n\nWhen a bluebottle has been dead for more than ten10 minutes it tastes impossibly bitter\n\nHe began a dizzying descent, trusting his legs to carry him down safely as he had his hands to shave and dress him. He kept a firm grip on the bannisters, smothering a groan at each step. As he crossed the landings, where there were hairpin turns, he clung on with both hands. He could have passed for a man with a hangover. But what had taken an hour to climb up took only seven minutes to climb down. Waiting for him in the hallway at the foot of the stairs was a group of very young men and women, each holding a folder. Respectfully they murmured, \u201cGood morning, prime minister,\u201d in a soft, uneven chorus. None of them dared look at him directly while they waited for him to speak.\n\nHe cleared his throat and managed to say, \u201cLet\u2019s get on, shall we.\u201d He was stuck for any further remark, but luckily a fellow, older than the rest and wearing a suit as expensive-looking as his own, pushed through and, seizing Jim by the elbow, propelled him along the corridor.\n\n\u201cA quick word.\u201d\n\nA door swung open and they went through. \u201cYour coffee\u2019s in here.\u201d\n\nThey were in the Cabinet room. Halfway down the long table by the largest chair was a tray of coffee, which the prime minister approached with such avidity that over the last few steps he broke into a run. He hoped to arrive ahead of his companion and snatch a moment with the sugar bowl. But by the time he was lowering himself into the chair, with minimal decorum, his coffee was being poured. There was no sugar on the tray. Not even milk. But in the grey shadow cast by his saucer, visible only to him, was a dying bluebottle. Every few seconds its wings trembled. With some effort, Jim wrenched his gaze away while he listened. He was beginning to think he might sneeze.\n\n\u201cAbout the 1922 Committee. The usual bloody suspects.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast night.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nWhen the bluebottle\u2019s wings shook they made the softest rustle of acquiescence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nWhen a bluebottle has been dead for more than 10 minutes it tastes impossibly bitter. Barely alive or just deceased, it has a cheese flavour. Stilton, mostly.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mutiny. And all over the morning papers.\u201d\n\nThere was nothing to be done. The prime minister had to sneeze. He had felt it building. Probably the lack of dust. He gripped the chair. For an explosive instant he thought he had passed out.\n\n\u201cBless you. There was talk of a no-confidence vote.\u201d\n\nWhen he opened his unhelpfully lidded eyes, the fly had gone. Blown away. \u201cFuck.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is it? I mean, where\u2019s the sense in \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cThe usual. You\u2019re a closet Clockwiser. Not with the Project. Not a true go-it-alone man. Getting nothing through parliament. Zero backbone. That sort of thing.\u201d\n\nJim drew his cup and saucer towards him. No. He lifted the stainless steel pot. Not under there either.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as Reversalist as any of them.\u201d\n\nBy his silence his special adviser, if that was what he was, appeared to disagree. Then he said, \u201cWe need a plan. And quick.\u201d\n\nIt was only now that the Welsh accent was evident. Wales? A small country far to the west, hilly, rain-sodden, treacherous. Jim was finding that he knew things, different things. He knew differently. His understanding, like his vision, was narrowed. He lacked the broad and instant union with the entirety of his kind, the boundless resource of the oceanic pheromonal. But he had finally remembered in full his designated mission.\n\n\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d\n\nThere came a loud single rap, the door opened and a tall man with a generous jaw, bottle-black swept-back hair and pinstripe suit strode in.\n\n\u201cJim, Simon. Mind if I join you? Bad news. Encryption just in from \u2013\u201d\n\nSimon interrupted. \u201cBenedict, this is private. Kindly bugger off.\u201d\n\nWithout a shift in expression, the foreign secretary turned and left the room, closing the door behind him with exaggerated care.\n\n\u201cWhat I resent,\u201d Simon said, \u201cabout these privately educated types is their sense of entitlement. Excluding you, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite. What\u2019s the plan?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve said it yourself. Take a step towards the hardliners, they scream for more. Give them what they want, they piss on you. Things go wrong with the Project, they blame anyone and everyone. Especially you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a wobble in the public mood. The focus groups are telling a new story. Our pollster phoned in the results last night. There\u2019s general weariness. Creeping fear of the unknown. Anxiety about what they voted for, what they\u2019ve unleashed.\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Author Ian McEwan photographed at his home in London. Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer\n\n\u201cI heard about those results,\u201d the prime minister lied. It was important to maintain face.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the point. We should isolate the hardliners. Confidence motion my arse! Prorogue parliament for a few months. Astound the bastards. Or even better, change tack. Swing \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean it. You\u2019ve got to swing \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cClockwise?\u2019\n\n\u201cYes! Parliament will fall at your feet. You\u2019ll have a majority \u2013 just.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the will of the p\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck the lot of them. Gullible wankers. It\u2019s a parliamentary democracy and you\u2019re in charge. The house is stalled. The country\u2019s tearing itself apart. We had that ultra-Reversalist beheading a Clockwise MP in a supermarket. A Clockwise yob pouring milkshake over a high-profile Reversalist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was shocking,\u201d the prime minister agreed. \u201cHis blazer had only just been cleaned.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole thing\u2019s a mess. Jim, time to call it off.\u201d Then he added softly, \u201cIt\u2019s in your power.\u201d\n\nThe PM stared into his adviser\u2019s face, taking it in for the first time. It was narrow and long, hollow at the temples, with little brown eyes and a tight rosebud mouth. He had a grey three-day beard and wore trainers and a black silk suit over a Superman T-shirt.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is very interesting,\u201d the PM said at last.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my job to keep you in office and this is the only way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be a\u2026 a\u2026\u201d Jim struggled for the word. He knew several variants in pheromone, but they were fading. Then he had it. \u201cA U-turn!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot quite. I\u2019ve been back through some of your speeches. Enough there to get you off the hook. Difficulties. Doubts. Delays. Sort of stuff the hardliners hate you for. Shirley can prepare the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery interesting indeed.\u201d Jim stood up and stretched.\n\n\u201cI need to talk to Shirley myself before Cabinet. And I\u2019ll need a few minutes alone.\u201d\n\nHe began to walk round the long table towards the door. He was coming to feel some pleasure in his stride and a new sense of control. Improbable as it had seemed, it was possible to feel stable on only two feet. It hardly bothered him to be so far off the ground. And he was glad now not to have eaten a bluebottle in another man\u2019s presence. It might not have gone down well.\n\nSimon said, \u201cI\u2019ll wait for your thoughts, then.\u201d\n\nJim reached the door and let the fingers of one strange hand rest lightly on the handle. Yes, he could drive this soft new machine. He turned, taking pleasure in doing it slowly, until he was facing the adviser, who had not moved from his chair.\n\n\u201cYou can have them now. I want your resignation letter on my desk within the half hour and I want you out of the building by 11.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This is an extract from Ian McEwan\u2019s latest book, The Cockroach, which will be published on 27 September by Vintage (\u00a37.99).
