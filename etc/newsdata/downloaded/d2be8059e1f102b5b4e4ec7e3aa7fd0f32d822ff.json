The umpire has since deactivated his Twitter account.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMajor league umpire Rob Drake tweeted \u201cI will be buying an AR-15 tomorrow, because if you impeach MY PRESIDENT this way, YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER CIVAL WAR!!! #MAGA2020\u201d, according to a copy of the tweet obtained by ESPN. MLB says it is aware of it.

On Saturday night, Astros Assistant General Manager Brandon Taubman taunted a group of female reporters about a Houston pitcher accused of domestic violence \u2014 an incident Sports Illustrated described as \u201coffensive and frightening.\"\n\nDrake, 50, who has been a full-time MLB ump since 2010, is perhaps best known for a 2011 altercation with St. Louis Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina, who was suspended for five games after bumping him and spraying him with spit. Drake co-founded \u201cCalling For Christ,\u201d an umpire training academy in Arizona, where he lives, according to his official MLB profile.\n\nThe MLB and Drake did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nAD\n\nDrake\u2019s tweet suggesting violence over Trump\u2019s increasing political peril echoed a right-wing talking point that began on the extreme fringes of the political spectrum but has grown increasingly common.\n\nAD\n\nThe claim that a politically splintered America is careening toward a \u201ccivil war\u201d started gaining mainstream attention earlier this year, but it has older roots in far-right political discourse, including the neo-Nazi race-war fantasies that inspired the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.\n\nIn March, The Washington Post reported that commentators on Fox News and MSNBC had discussed the potential of a second American-on-American conflict, although both pundits later walked back their comments by saying they considered the battle cultural rather than physical.\n\nAD\n\nIn September, Trump tweeted a quote from Southern Baptist pastor Robert Jeffress, who said on a Fox News segment, \u201cIf the Democrats are successful in removing the President, it will cause a civil warlike fracture in this nation.\u201d Fox News host Tucker Carlson has suggested a federal gun buyback program would lead to armed battles between Americans. On Oct. 11, former House speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox News \u201cwe are as close to a cultural civil war as we have been since the 1860s.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat talk of civil war often goes hand-in-hand with encouragement to stockpile weapons. In March, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who lost his committee assignments over his comments about white supremacy, posted a meme describing an imagined civil war in which red states would have the advantage of \u201c8 trillion bullets.\u201d Washington state Rep. Matt Shea (R), whose separatist vision spurred him to endorse training children for combat in a biblical war, has urged his followers to collect assault rifles and create ammo stashes.\n\nThe talking point has become so common now that Drake wasn\u2019t the only Trump supporter to make headlines Wednesday for talking about civil war and guns.\n\nAD\n\nRick Wiles, a Florida pastor known for making anti-Semitic comments on his nightly YouTube program, TruNews, also discussed on his show taking up arms against Democrats if Trump is impeached.\n\n\u201cIf they take him out, there is going to be violence in America,\u201d Wiles said on Wednesday. \u201cThere are people in this country \u2014 veterans, cowboys, mountain men, guys that know how to fight \u2014 and they\u2019re going to make a decision that the people that did this to Donald Trump are not going to get away with it and they\u2019re going to hunt them down.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Major League Baseball launched an investigation into umpire Rob Drake after he reportedly tweeted about buying a semiautomatic rifle and fighting in a \"CIVAL WAR\" if Congress impeaches President Trump.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Z0zpcS6WCRy14XNUCtEaJbyA8nI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QVTD3WTDDND3FFEGXAHWO3PLEI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
