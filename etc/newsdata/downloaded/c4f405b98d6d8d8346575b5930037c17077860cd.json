Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez following a televised town-hall event in the Bronx , N.Y., March 29, 2019. (Jeenah Moon/Reuters)\n\nAOC said something dumb and Newsweek is riding into her rescue with a piece headlined:\n\nALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ ATTACKED ON TWITTER FOR CONSTITUTIONAL MISTAKE\u2014BUT WAS SHE ACTUALLY RIGHT?\n\nThe freshperson congressperson said that Congress had to amend the Constitution to keep FDR from getting reelected:\n\n\u201cThey had to amend the constitution of the United States to make sure Roosevelt did not get reelected. There were so many extraordinary things that were happening at that time that were uniting working people,\u201d she continued.\n\nFDR died in 1945. The 22nd amendment was approved by Congress in 1947.\n\nThat\u2019s where Newsweek came to the rescue, \u201creporting\u201d what AOC\u2019s social-media fans said to clean up the mess:\n\nThe dates appeared to leave the argument cut-and-dried, with both Fox News and the Washington Examiner running the story and calling Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s claims false. However, some eagle-eyed social media commenters pointed out that the original architects of the 22nd Amendment were inspired by Roosevelt\u2019s monopoly on the White House and began campaigning long before his death.\n\nNow, this is correct as far as it goes, but it doesn\u2019t go very far. As I noted on Twitter, there was a movement afoot to prevent another president-for-life like FDR, but the odds that AOC was referencing any of that or was even aware of it seem extremely low.\n\nThat\u2019s why God keeps Newsweek alive:\n\n\u201cFDR did die in office in \u201845 and the 22nd amendment did come in \u201847 but Congress did start the legislative process in 1944 prior to his death so that he would not be reelected,\u201d another Twitter user wrote in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s defense. \u201cIt was not ratified soon enough and he won in \u201844. AOC did not misspeak, friends.\u201d The National Constitution Center also had Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s back. On its website, the nonpartisan organization explained: \u201cTalk about a presidential term-limits amendment started in 1944, when Republican candidate Thomas Dewey said a potential 16-year term for Roosevelt was a threat to democracy.\n\nNot for nothing, but Dewey was right. Among the myriad democratic norms violated by FDR, the most obvious was his flagrant defying of the tradition, started by Washington, of presidents serving only two terms. But that\u2019s irrelevant.\n\nWhat is relevant is that the National Constitution Center did not get \u201cOcasio-Cortez\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nThe Newsweek piece concludes: \u201cIn March 1947, a Republican-controlled Congress approved a 22nd Amendment, with an exception that would exclude a president in office from term limits during the ratification process.\u201d\n\nThe 22nd amendment exempted any president who was in office during the ratification process (and it wasn\u2019t even ratified until 1951). So, even if FDR hadn\u2019t died at the age of 63, even if he managed to get elected again despite his widely known frail condition, the 22nd amendment wouldn\u2019t have applied to him. He could have run again in 52 or 56 as well.\n\nI understand that people don\u2019t want to acknowledge that AOC sometimes says very untrue, easily checked things. But since when is it the job of news magazines to try to clean up the mess, when it\u2019s obvious the stain won\u2019t come out?", "description": "AOC said something dumb and Newsweek is riding into her rescue.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
