Hong Kong international airport on August 14 AP\n\n\u201cWe plan to disrupt activity at the airport to draw attention to what the government and the police are doing to us,\u201d said a 20-year-old protester who asked not to be named.\n\n\u201cIf we disrupt the airport, more foreigners will read the news about Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nMass Transit Railway (MTR), a major corporation overseeing public transport in the territory, suspended train service to the airport, the fourth busiest in Asia after Beijing, Dubai and Tokyo, according to Airports Council International data.\n\nProtesters also blocked buses arriving at the airport but police in riot helmets kept them out of the terminal\n\nSome travellers walked to the airport after the trains were suspended.\n\nAt least 26 flights from Hong Kong and 17 to the city had been cancelled as of 7:55pm local time, the South China Morning Post newspaper reported.\n\nPolice said the demonstration was illegal and protesters had \u201churled objects\u201d at officers and charged at water-filled barricades. A statement warned that police were preparing to clear away protesters and demanded that they \u201cstop their illegal acts and leave immediately\u201d.\n\nA separate statement said iron poles, bricks and rocks were thrown onto tracks of the airport train, \u201cseriously obstructing\u201d service.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Some attacked a train station in the adjacent Tung Chung area, using metal bars to smash lights and breaking open a fire hose valve, sending water gushing across the floor. They set up barricades on two adjacent streets and set fire to some of them.\n\nFirefighters arrived a few minutes later to douse the blaze.\n\nProtesters left the area after police flooded into the train station with riot shields.\n\nDrivers of taxis and private cars on the toll road from the airport picked up protesters to help them avoid arrest.\n\nElsewhere on Sunday, about 200 protesters huddled outside the British Consulate waving British flags and chanting \u201cEqual rights now!\u201d and \u201cStand with Hong Kong!\u201d A saxophonist played \u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d \u2013 Hong Kong was under British colonial rule for 156 years until 1997.\n\nThere have been no reports of casualties on Sunday yet.\n\nSaturday marked one of the most tense days since the clashes began. Defying a police ban, protesters demonstrated to mark the fifth anniversary of a decision by China against fully democratic elections in Hong Kong.\n\nSome attacked the central government building with petrol bombs and hurled objects at police, while officers fired water cannons and teargas at protesters as well as live rounds into the air.\n\nIn a typical turn of events linked to protesters\u2019 \u201cbe water\u201d strategy, most of the demonstration dispersed before police charged \u2013 only to flare up again with renewed intensity in a different part of the city.\n\nPolice grew more aggressive as the game of cat-and-mouse went on. During the night, officers stormed the platform of Prince Edward metro station and beat people on a train. Videos circulating online show many young men bleeding or limping after officers attacked protesters with clubs and pepper spray in the night.\n\n\u201cViolence directed at police on Saturday is no excuse for officers to go on the rampage elsewhere,\u201d said the director of Amnesty International in Hong Kong, Man-kei Tam, condemning the episode.\n\nMr Tam said in a press release that police beat people \u201cposing no threat whatsoever\u201d, used pepper spray \u201cin a carriage where people had no means to retreat\u201d, and medics were barred from entering the station. He added that a police officer appeared to aim a sponge grenade launcher at close range to those inside the train.\n\nMr Tam also condemned the use of undercover officers and blue dye water cannons to mark protesters.\n\n\u201cThese tactics pose a real threat to the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and the right to a fair trial,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police operation on Saturday only underscores the urgent need for an independent and proper investigation into the policing of the protests.\u201d\n\nAn independent investigation into police violence has been one of the protesters\u2019 main demands to broker an agreement.\n\nDemonstrations started over a controversial extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China \u2013 where citizens have fewer rights \u2013 to stand trial. But over time, demands burgeoned to include more democracy and the resignation of chief executive Carrie Lam.\n\nUnder an arrangement known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d, Hong Kong residents were promised they would be allowed to retain extensive freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China for at least 50 years after the city was handed over by the UK.\n\nBut many in Hong Kong fear these freedoms are already eroding. Films and art have been produced on the subject.\n\nAnd while commentators have referred to the unrest as the worst political crisis to grip Hong Kong in decades, protests are not new in the semi-autonomous territory.\n\nIn 2014, tens of thousands of peaceful demonstrators occupied some of the city\u2019s central districts for 77 days to protest against China\u2019s pre-screening of candidates for local elections. This action became known as \u201cUmbrella Movement\u201d \u2013 umbrellas were a symbol of passive resistance to police pepper spray.\n\nAdditional reporting by AP and Reuters", "description": "Protesters in Hong Kong blocked roads in the city with burning barricades after a night of violent clashes with police officers. \u00a0Several hundred\u00a0demonstrators\u00a0gathered at Hong Kong\u2019s terminal airport on Sunday.
