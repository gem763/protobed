It\u2019s all really overwhelming, I wish I had more time.\u2019\n\nThe timing was everything and the reality star made sure plans were in place in case she got the call that her baby was on the way while she was out of town.\n\n\u2018My sisters are on, so the attorney has my sister\u2019s number,\u2019 Kim told her surrogate at an appointment. \u2018Khlo\u00e9 [Kardashian] hopes that this happens when I\u2019m gone because she wants the baby.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim only planned to attend spend just 36 hours in New York City, but still, she feared that her little one might arrive early and throw her schedule into disarray.\n\n\u2018I just have to get to the Met and back before the baby comes,\u2019 she said. \u2018[The surrogate] is due in like eight days, but I\u2019m still going to stay committed to the Met.\n\n\u2018It has taken eight months to get our Met look perfected, and I committed to this, so I can\u2019t miss it. I just hope she doesn\u2019t have the baby early.\u2019\n\nKim\u2019s Met Gala look almost took a year to curate (Picture: Getty)\n\nOn the day of the fashion event of the year, Kim panicked: \u2018My anxiety is through the roof, but luckily I haven\u2019t heard from my surrogate, so I hope there\u2019s no emergency today and we just make it through tomorrow when we get home.\u2019\n\nLuckily though, the event unfolded without any hiccups and Kim made it back home to Los Angeles in time.\n\nHowever, things started to take a turn when she accompanied her surrogate to a doctor\u2019s appointment, as they were told the baby was breach and not in the correct position to be delivered.\n\n\u2018The baby is still breech, he keeps turning and then will be sideways,\u2019 the reality star said. \u2018It\u2019s pretty dangerous to deliver breech, so they might need an [external cephalic version].\n\nBaby Psalm was breach (Picture: Backgrid)\n\nThe mum went on to say that she too had to have the \u2018painful\u2019 treatment when she was pregnant with her second-born, Saint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExplaining the procedure, Kim told the cameras: \u2018A version is just where they kind of push on the baby and try to turn him manually from the outside of the belly.\n\n\u2018I hope she doesn\u2019t have to do it because it\u2019s a really scary feeling. My anxiety is through the roof.\u2019\n\nThe doctor was convinced that the baby would flip around on its own, however, they called him a few days later saying they would need to help it move.\n\n\u2018This was the last thing that we wanted,\u2019 Kim admitted.\n\nBut whether she liked it or not there was no more time left to panic as the baby arrived the following day.\n\nThose that are up to date on the Kardashians, know that Kim and Kanye welcomed their baby son Psalm via surrogate on 9 May.\n\nThe pair are also parents to North, Saint and Chicago.\n\nKeeping Up With The Kardashian\u2019s airs Sundays at 9pm on E! in the US.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
