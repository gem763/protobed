Receipts totaled $3.4 trillion, up 4% through September, while federal spending rose 8%, to $4.4 trillion, including higher spending on the military, interest payments on the debt and Medicare.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday that President Trump's economic agenda is working, pointing to the strong job market and sustained paycheck growth.\n\n\"In order to truly put America on a sustainable financial path, we must enact proposals -- like the president's 2020 budget plan -- to cut wasteful and irresponsible spending,\" Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement accompanying the latest figures.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, annual deficits have nearly doubled despite a historically low jobless rate and stronger wage gains, as tax cuts enacted restrained revenue growth last year and two bipartisan budget deals ramped up government spending. Deficits are on track to exceed $1 trillion a year over the coming decades and would rise even higher if the economy turns south.\n\nDeficits usually shrink during economic expansions as rising household income and corporate profits boost government tax revenues, while spending for safety-net programs, like unemployment insurance or food stamps, declines.\n\nAs a share of economic output, deficits totaled 4.6% in fiscal 2019, up from 3.8% in 2018, the Treasury said. Revenues as a share of gross domestic product fell last year, to 16.3% from 16.4% in the previous fiscal year, while federal outlays surged, to 20.9% of GDP from 20.2% the previous year.\n\nTax revenue rebounded in fiscal 2019, following steep declines in corporate tax revenue and flat individual tax receipts last year following the tax cuts enacted in 2017. The Treasury Department said Friday corporate tax receipts increased 12% in the fiscal year ending in September, with most of the gains occurring in the second half of the fiscal year, while individual income tax revenue rose 3%.\n\nHigher tax revenues weren't enough to offset federal spending. Increases in interest rates and a bigger government debt load pushed up interest costs by 10%, to $573 billion. Medicare spending also rose 10% to $783 billion, due to rising enrollment and higher health-care costs, a senior Treasury official said, and spending on the military climbed 8%, to $654 billion.\n\nThe fiscal 2019 deficit eclipsed $1 trillion through August, but fell in September, when the government typically records a surplus as corporations make quarterly tax payments.\n\nLong-term costs associated with an aging population, including higher Social Security and Medicare spending, are also expected to continue pushing up deficits over the coming decades.\n\nThe president and his advisers have privately discussed refocusing on cutting spending in his second term, according to aides.\n\nThose deficits have led the Treasury to ramp up borrowing in recent years. The government has said it expects to borrow more than $1 trillion for the second year in a row in 2019.\n\nWrite to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 25, 2019 14:50 ET (18:50 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
