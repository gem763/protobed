For example, the two best buddies in the first story, \u201cWater Booger Bears,\u201d make a brief, frantic announcement in the final tale, \u201cThe Broom Dog,\u201d and the crossing guard Ms. Post appears in a number of stories. A rosebush noted as damaged in one story surfaces at a key moment in another. The tone ranges from the funny, endearing \u201cHow a Boy Can Become a Grease Fire,\u201d about a kid being prepped to talk to his crush, to the heart-rending \u201cSkitter Hitter,\u201d with a girl bullied because of her skateboarding skills. Early adolescent concerns \u2014 friendship, family, anxiety, sexual identity \u2014 emerge through two taunted gamers in \u201cCall of Duty\u201d and the vividly rendered, edgy foursome bonded by cancer in \u201cThe Low Cuts Strike Again.\u201d\n\nReynolds connects his characters to their community \u2014 a living world larger than them \u2014 in playful, often profound ways. The middle schoolers reflect on a little girl swinging, with \u201chappiness for a face,\u201d a pigeon the color of \u201cclouds before rain,\u201d a dog licking a lonely man\u2019s face \u2014 and the elemental nature of boogers.\n\nMary Quattlebaum, author of such books as \u201cPirate vs. Pirate\u201d and the Jo MacDonald series, regularly reviews books for young readers for The Post.", "description": "From the author of \u201cGhost\u201d and \u201cLong Way Down,\u201d another poignant tale about growing up.", "authors": ["Mary Quattlebaum", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
