They used rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse demonstrators in Beirut's commercial district. Dozens of people were wounded and detained.\n\nLebanon's internal security apparatus said 52 police were injured on Friday and its forces arrested 70 people.\n\n191018033008002\n\nTwo Syrian workers died after they were trapped in a shop that was set on fire by protesters in Beirut on Friday.\n\nSome protesters, including men in black hoods, blocked roads, set tyres on fire and used iron bars to smash storefronts in Beirut's posh downtown district.\n\nAs fires blazed, some streets in the capital looked like a battlefield, strewn with rubber bullets, smashed up cars, broken glass and torn billboards. Firefighters struggled late into the night to douse the flames.\n\nWho are the protesters?\n\nIn a country fractured along sectarian lines, the unusually wide geographic reach of the protests highlights the deepening anger.\n\nCutting across sectarian and religious lines, Lebanese have come out on to the streets, waving banners and chanting slogans urging Hariri's government to go.\n\nThe Middle East country is divided on sectarian lines, with each of the main sects holding a position in government - the president must be Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament a Shia Muslim and so on.\n\nReflecting the scale of public anger, rare demonstrations were reported in neighbourhoods dominated by powerful Shia movement Hezbollah, not used to the opposition in its own bastions.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, Shia protesters also attacked the offices of their deputies from the influential Hezbollah and Amal movements in southern Lebanon.\n\n\"We came to the streets because we can no longer bear this situation. This regime is totally corrupt,\" said Fadi Issa, 51, who marched with his son.\n\n\"They are all thieves, they come into the government to fill their pockets, not to serve the country.\"\n\nGovernment response so far\n\nLebanon's prime minister has given his coalition partners a 72-hour ultimatum to back his reform agenda amid growing nationwide protests.\n\nIn a televised speech on Friday evening, Hariri said he understood their anger and was trying to push through change.\n\nHe called on his coalition partners to give a \"clear, decisive and final response to convince me, the Lebanese people and the international community ... that everyone has decided on reforms, or I will have something else to say\".\n\nHe gave them a 72-hour deadline to do so, without directly threatening to resign.\n\nPresident Michel Aoun received a delegation on Friday representing protesters.\n\nAoun's office posted a photo of the meeting that consisted of eight persons sitting with Aoun at the presidential palace in Beirut's southeastern suburb of Baabda.\n\nA member of the delegation told reporters that they told Aoun the government must resign and be replaced by an emergency Cabinet that calls for early parliamentary elections.", "description": "Cutting across sects and walks of life, Lebanese have hit the streets demanding an overhaul of government institutions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/18/8a52fa666dfe4392b47140799bbe9c92_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
