Even that would be at risk if the government determined children were attracted to it or that it was being marketed to them, Azar said.\n\nThe move is the most sweeping action yet by the U.S. government to crack down on what it has called an \u201cepidemic\u201d of youth e-cigarette usage.\n\nThe FDA in March formally proposed guidelines that would prohibit the sale of flavored e-cigarette products, except mint and menthol, in traditional retail outlets. Under that proposal, which had not been finalized, e-cigarette makers could still sell flavored products online and in age-restricted stores, such as vape shops.\n\nWednesday\u2019s proposal goes much further, banning the sale of all flavored e-cigarette products across all retail channels, aside from tobacco-flavored products.\n\nDespite the increased public attention around teenage e-cigarette use over the last year, HHS on Wednesday pointed to data showing that the problem has worsened. Preliminary data shows more than a quarter of U.S. high school students used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days. That is up from 20.8% last year and 11.7% in 2017.\n\nSix deaths have been linked to vaping and U.S. public health officials are investigating 450 cases of potential vaping-related lung illness across 33 states and one U.S. territory. Health officials have cited patients\u2019 use of cannabis liquids in many, though not all, of those cases, some of which only involved nicotine vaping.\n\n\u201cWe have a problem in our country, it\u2019s a new problem ... and it\u2019s called vaping, especially vaping as it pertains to innocent children,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cThere have been deaths and there have been a lot of other problems.\u201d\n\nSURGE IN USE BY ADOLESCENTS\n\nJuul Labs Inc, which dominates the U.S. e-cigarette market, has faced withering criticism over the last two years after becoming wildly popular among teenagers. The company has taken steps to try to reduce its appeal among youth, including pulling flavors except mint and menthol from traditional retail stores, suspending its social media accounts and toughening age verification online.\n\nIn December, Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc (MO.N) made a $12.8 billion investment in Juul, taking a 35% stake.\n\nJuul spokesman Ted Kwong said \u201cwe strongly agree with the need for aggressive category-wide action on flavored products,\u201d adding the company \u201cwill fully comply with the final FDA policy when effective.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump answers questions from the news media in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., September 11, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nA spokesman for Imperial Brands Plc (IMB.L), which sells the Blu line of e-cigarettes, declined to comment.\n\nKaelan Hollon, a spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co (BATS.L), which sells Vuse e-cigarettes in the United States, did not directly address the proposed flavor ban but said the company shares the administration\u2019s goal of keeping products away from youth.\n\nWednesday\u2019s move by the White House comes after more than a year of mounting pressure from lawmakers, public health advocates and parents looking to end marketing of products aimed at youth.\n\nIn recent months state and local governments have also stepped in. In June, San Francisco approved a ban on the sale of all e-cigarette products, and last week Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced plans to ban flavored e-cigarettes in her state.\n\nA nationwide investigation led by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FDA has not definitively linked the illnesses to any specific e-cigarette product or ingredient, although health officials have expressed suspicions about the effects of inhaling vitamin E acetate, which is contained in some THC vaping products.\n\nThe FDA has urged consumers to avoid inhaling vitamin E acetate, buying vaping products on the street, using marijuana-derived oil with the products or modifying a store-bought vape product.\n\nWhile e-cigarettes are marketed as tools to help smokers quit, health officials believe some companies are attracting a new generation of nicotine users.\n\nAzar said recent data showed a surge in adolescent usage of e-cigarettes and that youth were drawn to flavors including mint and menthol. About 8 million U.S. adults use such cigarettes and 5 million children were doing so as well.\n\n\u201cThis is exceptionally harmful to our children,\u201d he said. \u201cAn entire generation of children risk becoming addicted to nicotine because of the attractiveness ... and availability of these vaping products.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nE-cigarette makers will still have the chance to demonstrate their flavored products serve a public health purpose.\n\nAll such companies are required to submit applications to the FDA by next May demonstrating their products and proposed flavors provide a net public health benefit. The FDA, after reviewing those applications, could authorize companies to sell flavored products if the agency is satisfied with the proposals.", "description": "The Trump administration announced plans on Wednesday to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves in a widening crackdown on vaping, as officials warned that sweet flavors had drawn millions of children into nicotine addiction.", "authors": ["Jeff Mason", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428777704&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1L0", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
