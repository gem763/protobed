However, in this case, it is not contentious that there were other coinciding events during DP World\u2019s selected comparative period. Those events included protected industrial action taken during April, March and June 2019 and changed work practices over the same period,\u201d she concluded.\n\nDP Mansini accepted evidence that crane and straddle productivity had steadily risen over April to June because of the new management\u2019s attempts to improve customer service and turnaround times. As a result, \u201cthese figures do not represent a common of normal business scenario\u201d.\n\n\u201cEven having regard to [the] justifications for selecting this period ... in all of the circumstances and given the significance and seriousness of what is alleged, the discrete period of April to June 2019 does not appear to be an ideal comparator or sound foundation on which to proceed,\u201d she decided.\n\nQuite obviously, this was not the view taken in the Federal Court where effectively the same data points of productivity decline were presented to the court by the same DP World managers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Federal Court DP World successfully supported its claim of a \u201csudden and significant drop in productivity\u201d at the West Swanson terminal with a set of data rich in detail and drama.\n\nHallmarks of co-ordination\n\nIt was claimed, for example, that after July\u2019s protected action, the land-side straddles that carry containers around the terminal were taking 7 per cent more time to travel 4 per cent less distance and that 83 per cent of straddle drivers had generated worse than average performance through that 16-day period.\n\nDP World claimed that reported equipment faults from straddle drivers had risen 250 per cent through the back end of July against what they had been in the week before the stoppage, and that some complaints had been \u201cas obviously trivial as the presence of rubbish in a straddle cabin\u201d.\n\nIt reported that crane availability through the second half of July had suddenly fallen to a 2019 low and crane movements were 28 per cent lower than they had been through April and June.\n\nIt argued that \u201cby its nature, the gross moves per hour metric accounts for the various forms of protected industrial action that the CFMMEU and its members have waged throughout July 2019\u201d and claimed that none of the performance retreats described could be attributable to operational or environmental factors such as breakdowns or inclement weather.\n\nAnd, in issuing his August decision against the union, Justice Snaden identified that this downshift in performance appeared to hold \u201call the hallmarks of sophisticated, central co-ordination; and to have been executed by a person or persons who apparently command the loyalty of a significant proportion of the relevant employees\u201d. In other words, the union or its officials had arranged covert action and it had to stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDP World and the union have been at loggerheads with the waterfront union since March over a proposed new enterprise agreement that attempts to embed new roster flexibilities in the name of cost management and productivity.\n\nThe roots of DP World\u2019s need for reform lie in the changed competitive framework of the stevedoring industry and the aligned facts that the port operator\u2019s share of the Australian container market and its financial performance have withered dramatically over the past year or so.\n\nIn April, just a month into the union negotiations, new DP World chief executive Glen Hilton warned that competition from Melbourne\u2019s fully automated third player was a sectoral game-changer whose impact was not yet fully appreciated by the union.\n\nFlexibility or automation\n\nIn what was his first interview since taking over from high profile predecessor Paul Scurrah, Hilton told The Australian Financial Review: \u201cThe big change on the waterfront is the level of automation and I don\u2019t think the union, in terms of its approach, have adapted to that.\u201d\n\nThen, foreshadowing the contest now in play, Hilton warned: \u201cVolumes are down because of new entrants. They have cheaper operating models because they don\u2019t have the level of labour on site. But it is hard to get them [the union] to put that into the conversation or get them into that reality.\n\n\u201cIf there is any major port operator that needs to have flexibility [in its EA] it is DP. Flexibility is our issue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have lost significant volumes in Melbourne and we have to deal with the outcome of that.\u201d\n\nTo be clear on that, DP is a manual operator in Melbourne and Sydney and is only semi-automated in Brisbane. But in each of those three key east coast destinations, it faces increasingly automated competition \u2013 Patrick in Brisbane and Sydney and Victoria International Container Terminal in Melbourne.\n\nIn August, Hilton said DP World owned neither the need nor the desire to speed down the new technology path. Instead, Hilton was banking on the potential of workplace reform that would allow DP World to more successfully harvest the capital it had already deployed.\n\n\u201cIt is an economic decision eventually,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see ourselves having to go down that path in the short-to-medium term. It depends on arrangements we can build with our stakeholders in the unions,\u201d he told the Financial Review in August. \u201cIf things become unmanageable, we have that option.\u201d\n\nWhether the current state of negotiations and contest has reached that tipping point, time should very quickly tell.", "description": "The Fair Work Commission has rejected docker's data supporting claims of a waterfront \"go slow\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9405%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_77%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/351a970e2a84582cad83804635a5ffe2a995b9a0", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
