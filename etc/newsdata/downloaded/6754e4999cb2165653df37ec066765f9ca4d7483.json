Week 7 offers up juicy matchups and we are here to help you make money off of them. USA TODAY\n\nThe official proclamation that Saquon Barkley will play Sunday against Arizona may come as soon as Friday. For the time being, a coy Barkley is playing along with the team.\n\nAsked several times Thursday about the possibility of returning from the high right ankle sprain that sidelined him for a month, the Giants\u2019 star running back repeated time after time, \u201cI\u2019m just day-to-day.\u201d\n\nThe smirk on Barkley\u2019s face said it all.\n\nAfter practicing Wednesday and Thursday, he may not be included on Friday\u2019s injury report, which is the league-mandated vehicle for announcing that a player won\u2019t play in a game. Giants coach Pat Shurmur prefers to extend the status of injuries until the league deadlines.\n\nStill, expect Barkley and tight end Evan Engram, who missed the New England game with a sprained knee, to start against the Cardinals. Both have checked all the boxes on their rehab sheets.\n\nQuarterback Daniel Jones can use the extra help in his matchup against Kyler Murray, the No. 1 overall pick, that has all the makings of an offensive shootout.\n\nEngram is probably drooling after watching game tapes of the Cardinals\u2019 pass defense. Arizona ranks last in the league in containing tight ends. Like Barkley, Engram has practiced two days in a row.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be good getting back out there,\u201d Engram said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a kid in the candy shop again.\u201d\n\nJones is likely eager to get Barkley back to the offense. The pair played only 23 snaps together in the Tampa Bay game before Barkley was injured. The Giants rallied to win without him and beat Washington the next week. Then came losses to Minnesota and New England that leaves the Giants at 2-4.\n\nThe time away from the game ate at Barkley. During his rehab, he was an early morning visitor to the weight room and the trainer\u2019s room.\n\n\u201cWhen you get the game taken away from you, it makes you appreciate it even more,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cI know a lot of people call me a super-healer, but it\u2019s a lot of hard work.\u201d\n\nTeammates talk about how the second-year star doesn\u2019t assume anything. He\u2019s among the hardest workers in a clubhouse that has been singled out by several assistant coaches for its professionalism.\n\n\u201cI always want to be out there,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cI get up every single morning and live my dream. I feel like a little kid again.\u201d\n\nThe team thinks Barkley will bring out the best in Jones, their first-year investment at quarterback.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s ready to play, he\u2019ll get a full complement (of the game plan),\u201d offensive coordinator Mike Shula said. \u201cIf we have any hesitation at all\u2026\u201d\n\nBarkley has no hesitations. He says he feels \u201cpretty good\u201d after making the necessary cuts in practice, something he couldn\u2019t do when working out on the sidelines, away from his teammates.\n\nAsked what he could do to help Jones, he answered: \u201cDo what I do best. Be me.\u201d\n\nThe Giants would appreciate that.", "description": "The smirk on Saquon Barkley\u2019s face said it all.
