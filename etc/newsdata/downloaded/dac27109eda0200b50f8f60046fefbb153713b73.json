This is a cover-up,\u201d Pelosi said, repeating it for emphasis, at a news conference with reporters. The California Democrat then read directly from the newly released whistleblower complaint \u2014 which centered on Trump\u2019s conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky in July \u2014 and states that the White House tried to \u201clock down\u201d all records of the call and move them to a more secure electronic system.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPelosi said Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to seek political help from Ukrainian leaders and later bury key documents \u201cbetrayed his oath of office\u201d and threatened national security and elections, hours after the damning complaint was made public Thursday morning.\n\n\"We are at a different level of lawlessness that is self-evident to the American people,\" Pelosi said, adding, \"We have a heightened responsibility to act upon those facts.\"\n\nTrump on Thursday fired back, accusing Pelosi of being \u201chijacked by the radical left.\u201d\n\nIt's not the first time Pelosi has accused Trump of a \"cover-up.\" She told reporters in May after Trump stormed out of a White House meeting on infrastructure: \"We believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.\" Trump responded then: \"I don't do cover-ups.\"\n\nPelosi did not say whether the complaint, along with the high-profile testimony of acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Thursday, would expedite her caucus\u2019 path toward impeachment.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\nHouse Democrats this week took the momentous step of embracing an impeachment inquiry into Trump. But Pelosi reiterated that Democrats plan to move cautiously, with no specific timeline to draft or vote on articles of impeachment.\n\n\u201cThere are some in our caucus who think, let\u2019s just have an impeachment. No, we have to have an inquiry to further establish the facts,\u201d Pelosi said to a packed room of reporters. \u201cThere is no rush to judgment.\u201d\n\nThe complaint specifically alleged that White House officials had witnessed Trump \u201cabuse his office for personal gain.\u201d It also claimed that White House lawyers directed White House officials to store transcripts in an electronic system typically meant for classified information, though the document itself was not classified.\n\nSeveral Democrats said Thursday that the release of the whistleblower complaint appeared to escalate the urgency for action \u2014 even before many read the entire report \u2014 by offering an even clearer case against Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked and I\u2019m only on the first page,\u201d Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) said, holding up the report. So far, though, she said the contents were more damning than she expected to see in the complaint.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), who said he hasn\u2019t yet read the full report, said it was clear Trump had violated the law.\n\n\u201cHe likely has engaged in multiple acts of trying to cover it up,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cThat\u2019s the substance of what we need to present to the American people.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Pelosi did not say if the complaint would speed up Democrats' path toward impeachment.", "authors": ["Sarah Ferris", "Heather Caygle"], "top_image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/1792/1155968404_6089767189001_6089756909001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
