It had never attracted much attention from the woman, in her 90s, or her family, who thought it was simply an old icon from Russia. It might have ended up in a bin during the house move this summer had it not been spotted by an auctioneer who had come to value furniture.\n\nAt an auction outside Paris on Sunday, the unsigned work, measuring just 26cm by 20cm, fetched \u20ac19.5m under the hammer, rising to over \u20ac24m when fees were included.\n\nThe Act\u00e9on auction house in Senlis said in a statement that the sale was the biggest for a medieval painting and the eighth highest for a medieval or old master painting. The painting now ranks alongside works by Leonardo da Vinci, Rubens, Rembrandt and Raphael in the top 10 of most expensive old painting sales.\n\n\u201cWhen a unique work of a painter as rare as Cimabue comes to market, you have to be ready for surprises,\u201d said Dominique Le Coent, who heads the Act\u00e9on auction house in Senlis. \u201cThis is the only Cimabue that has ever come on the market.\u201d\n\nAs 800 people gathered in the auction hall in Senlis, the crowd fell silent during the nail-biting final moments of bidding. Some bids came in by telephone to agents. As the auctioneer brandished his hammer as the price crept up, he said: \u201cThere will never be another Cimabue at auction.\u201d\n\nAct\u00e9on did not reveal the identity of the buyer but said a foreign museum had been among the bidders.\n\nThe painting had hung on the kitchen wall for so long that the woman, who asked to remain anonymous, told the auction house she had no idea where it had come from or how it had come into the family\u2019s hands.\n\nCimabue, also known as Cenni di Pepo, was one of the pioneering artists of the early Italian Renaissance. Only 11 works painted on wood have been attributed to him, none of them signed.\n\nArt experts at Turquin in Paris used infrared reflectography to confirm that the piece was part of a larger diptych from 1280, when Cimabue painted eight scenes of the passion and crucifixion of Christ. Each of the two panels in the diptych had four scenes.\n\nTwo scenes from the same diptych, known as The Virgin and Child with Two Angels and The Flagellation of Christ, already hang in the National Gallery in London and the Frick Collection in New York.\n\nCimabue, who taught the Italian master Giotto, is widely considered the forefather of the Italian Renaissance. He broke from the Byzantine style popular in the Middle Ages and began to incorporate elements of movement and perspective that came to characterise western painting.\n\nThe National Gallery described Cimabue\u2019s work as representing \u201ca crucial moment in the history of art\u201d when Italian painters, while still influenced by Byzantine painting, were exploring the naturalistic depiction of forms and three-dimensional space.\n\nThe Cimabue in the kitchen: is the miraculous discovery all that it seems? Read more\n\nIn June, when the woman decided to sell her house and move away, an expert at the Senlis auctioneers was contacted to look at the contents of the house in case some of it could be sold.\n\n\u201cI had a week to give an expert view on the house contents and empty it,\u201d Philom\u00e8ne Wolf told Le Parisien last month. \u201cI had to make room in my schedule \u2026 if I didn\u2019t, then everything was due to go to the dump.\u201d\n\nWolf said she noticed the painting as soon as she entered the house. \u201cYou rarely see something of such quality. I immediately thought it was a work of Italian primitivism. But I didn\u2019t imagine it was a Cimabue.\u201d\n\nThe auctioneer, who began her job at the auction house only last year, suggested that the woman bring the painting to experts for an evaluation. She initially thought there might be a sale price of \u20ac300,000-\u20ac400,000, until art expert valued it at millions.\n\nAbout 100 other objects from the house were sold for around \u20ac6,000 and the remaining furniture and decorations were disposed of at the local dump.", "description": "Christ Mocked by Italian artist Cimabue had been valued at \u20ac4m-\u20ac6m before auction", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b487e8da1b971eeaa8d12caf52c48940146e4813/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f6491db5171159227071b62b646aecf7", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
