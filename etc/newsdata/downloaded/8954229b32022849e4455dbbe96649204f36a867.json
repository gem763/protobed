He will be sorely missed.\u2019\n\nThe Arkansas Game and Fish Commission says hunters should leave a deer alone for 30 minutes after shooting to make sure it is dead.\n\nThey also recommend watching a deer\u2019s chest to establish whether it is still breathing.\n\nIt is unclear whether the deer that killed Stephens survived its injuries.", "description": "Thomas Alexander's chest was punctured by the deer he'd just shot during the vicious attack in Yellville, Arkansas on Tuesday", "authors": ["Jimmy Mccloskey"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1571938354_1571940770.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
