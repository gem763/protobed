A final accident report released Friday said Lion Air flight 610, from Indonesia's capital Jakarta to the island of Sumatra, crashed because the pilots were never told how to quickly respond to malfunctions of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet's automated flight-control system.\n\nThe jet plunged into the Java Sea just 13 minutes after its takeoff on Oct. 29, 2018.\n\nIndonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee said the automated system, known as MCAS, relied on a single \"angle of attack\" sensor that provided erroneous information, automatically shoving the nose of the Max jet down.\n\nThe report also identified various missteps prior to the crash. The aircraft, only in use for two months, had problems on its last four flights, including one the day before its fatal accident.\n\nThe Indonesian report followed another last month from U.S. federal accident investigators who concluded that Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration underestimated how a blizzard of visual and auditory warnings would slow pilots' ability to respond quickly enough to avert crashes.\n\nBoeing admits flight control system was likely factor in two crashes that killed 346\n\nJust five months after the Indonesian crash, the same kind of malfunction caused a Max jet to crash in Ethiopia, killing all 157 people on board.\n\nThat led to the grounding of all 737 Max jets and put Boeing under intense pressure to explain problems associated with the MCAS system.\n\nIn a statement issued Friday, Boeing's CEO expressed condolences to the crash victims' families and the company said it had taken multiple steps to \"prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again.\"\n\nThe manufacturer said it had \"redesigned\" the way the sensors on the front of Max jets work with flight control software to make the plane's computers \"compare information from both AoA (angle of attack) sensors before activating, adding a new layer of protection.\"\n\nBoeing said the MCAS system would now only engage \"if both AoA sensors agree, will only activate once in response to erroneous AoA, and will always be subject to a maximum limit that can be overridden with the control column.\"\n\nBoeing exec Kevin McAllister ousted amid substantial financial losses\n\nThe company said it was also \"updating crew manuals and pilot training, designed to ensure every pilot has all of the information they need to fly the 737 MAX safely.\"\n\nBut as of yet, the Max aircraft still have not resumed flying. Boeing recently reported its third-quarter earnings dropped 51% to $1.17 billion in part because it added $900 million more in costs for the Max.\n\n\"We are very angry (at Boeing) because their negligence has caused our loved ones to die,\" said Muhammad Asdori, 55, whose brother and nephew were killed in the Lion Air crash.\n\n\"They should have anticipated any kind of problems with adequate training for pilots who fly their planes. We were even more angry when we learned that they had only admitted their mistake when the second MAX8 plane crashed in Ethiopia.\"", "description": "Flight 610 plunged into the Java Sea just 13 minutes after takeoff a year ago, killing all 189 people on board", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/27/d18205cf-41c7-449f-91cc-41258a6a088e/thumbnail/1200x630g1/5d03bf66ecc54efdbb17d848c8840ea6/ap-18308527309661.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
