It\u2019s \u2018Too Early to Turn Cautious.\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nTrade wars, political turmoil, and shaky U.S. economic data have plenty of investors wondering if the decadelong bull market might be on its last legs. And they\u2019re not unreasonable for worrying.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t all bad out there, say a team of strategists at Citi Research. They still see plenty of reasons to hold stocks.\n\nThe strategists forecast a 9% rise in global equities by the end of 2020, but note that the path could be bumpy. While economic expansion is undoubtedly slowing from recent years\u2019 robust growth, they see moves by central banks around the world boosting stocks in 2020, as they have for much of this year.\n\n\u201cThis slowdown is broadly spread across the global economy,\u201d the Citi strategists wrote in a recent report. \u201cTrade wars are proving a drag, as are heightened political tensions. While this is unhelpful for global equities, its effect should be dampened by easy monetary policy. Rate cuts and further [quantitative easing] keep borrowing costs low and make [stock] valuations against bonds look attractive.\u201d\n\nQuantitative easing involves central banks buying government bonds or other assets to drive down interest rates and pump cash into the economy.\n\nCiti economists forecast global gross domestic product growth of 2.7% in 2020. That compares with the International Monetary Fund\u2019s estimate of a 3.2% increase this year, and 3.6% in 2018.\n\nU.S. equities are likely to perform better than those elsewhere, the bank says. Chief U.S. equity strategist Tobias Levkovich sees the S&P 500 rising to 3300 by the end of 2020\u2014about 13% above its recent 2931. He sees a combination of earnings-per-share growth and investors valuing stocks more highly relative to profits as lifting the index. While companies\u2019 leverage, or level of indebtedness, is high relative to history, Levkovich notes that low borrowing costs make that less of a concern.\n\nU.S. companies generate more free cash flow and their earnings are growing faster, so they deserve richer valuations than those overseas and could keep rising, the bank says.\n\n\u201cBull markets narrow, and this bull market is narrowing into U.S. equities,\u201d Levkovich wrote. \u201cWe think it\u2019s still too early to turn cautious.\u201d\n\nThe Citi strategists also look for markets experiencing \u201cde-equitization\u201d\u2014those where companies are buying back more shares than they are issuing. With fewer shares outstanding, the remaining units of stock represent a claim to a larger share of the underlying company\u2019s earnings, boosting profits per share, all else equal. That justifies a higher valuation, says Citi.\n\nCiti identified the U.S. and U.K. markets as experiencing the most de-equitization, saying the number of shares outstanding has declined by 2.3% and 3.0%, respectively, since the beginning of 2018. Markets in Japan and the rest of Europe have lagged behind.\n\nWhile the long fight over the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union is a risk for the British economy and stocks, markets may have moved too far in response, say the Citi strategists. Seventy percent of sales of FTSE 100 companies come from outside of the U.K., making the index\u2019s earnings more sensitive to global GDP than U.K GDP.\n\nCiti expects only \u201cmiddling growth\u201d for the U.K. economy next year.\n\n\u201cU.K. equities appear very cheap; they have the highest dividend yield and [free cash flow] yield amongst major markets,\u201d wrote the Citi strategists. \u201cMuch negative sentiment seems to be priced in, as the equity risk premium is at an all time high.\u201d\n\nThe Brexit discount means that companies may take the opportunity to respond through more mergers and greater share buybacks, accelerating de-equitization. Citi believes the FTSE 100 could reach 8100 by the end of 2020, almost 14% above its recent 7136.\n\nThe bank is neutral on Japanese and continental European equities for 2020, given slowing economies and not particularly compelling de-equitization trends. They recommend that investors take underweight positions in emerging markets, as growth driven by China and globalization slows in many export-dependent countries.\n\nThe primary risks the Citi strategists are watching include the fragility of global economic growth and the possibility that a slowdown could become a recession sooner than expected. They note that a so-called inverted yield curve in U.S. Treasuries, when yields on short-dated debt exceed those on longer-dated securities, has preceded past recessions, but that a downturn wouldn\u2019t necessarily begin right away. The curve has inverted repeatedly in recent months.\n\nThe strategists don\u2019t expect a U.S.-China trade deal before the 2020 presidential election, and see the associated uncertainty continuing to dampen investment. Finally, they note that political risks are high and that they do weigh on sentiment.\n\n\u201cBrexit, trade wars, Mideast security tensions, Hong Kong protests, and the U.S. 2020 pre-election dynamics could all add to increased uncertainty,\u201d wrote the Citi strategists. \u201cOur economists argue that a higher level of uncertainty leads to a decline in [U.S., Germany, Japan, and the U.K.] employment by three quarters, trade growth by two quarters, and investment by one quarter.\u201d\n\nWrite to Nicholas Jasinski at nicholas.jasinski@barrons.com", "description": "Strategists at the bank forecast a 9% rise in global equities by the end of 2020, but note that the path could be bumpy.", "authors": ["Nicholas Jasinski"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-113566/social", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
