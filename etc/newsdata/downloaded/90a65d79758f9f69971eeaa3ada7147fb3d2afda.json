The longtime analyst of public opinion opened his bedroom curtains and saw, less than a mile away, flames chewing the dark sky over Los Angeles. Luntz \u2014 who specializes in how the public reacts to words \u2014 saw scary evidence of a threat that he once tried to neutralize with language. In 2001, he\u2019d written a memo of environmental talking points for Republican politicians and instructed them to scrub their vocabulary of \u201cglobal warming,\u201d because it had \u201ccatastrophic connotations,\u201d and rely on another term: \u201cclimate change,\u201d which suggested \u201ca more controllable and less emotional challenge.\u201d\n\nLast month, with a revised script, Luntz appeared before the Senate Democrats\u2019 Special Committee on the Climate Crisis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here before you to say that I was wrong in 2001,\u201d Luntz said. Nearby was a colorful chart of vocabulary, developed since his polling in 2009 showed bipartisan support for climate legislation. He went on: \u201cI\u2019ve changed. And I will help you with messaging, if you wish to have it.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t talk about threats, he told the senators. Talk about consequences.\n\nDon\u2019t talk about new jobs created by green energy. Talk about new careers.\n\nAnd sustainability?\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d Luntz said. \u201cSustainability is about the status quo.\u201d\n\nEven the committee\u2019s name had a troublesome word in it: \u201ccrisis.\u201d It\u2019s flabby from overuse, Luntz thought. If everything is a crisis, then nothing is.\n\nFrom a word standpoint, that\u2019s true. And sometimes it feels true in the real world. The phone in your hand has become a police scanner of unfolding crises. The Kashmir crisis, the Hong Kong crisis, the border crisis, the trade crisis, the measles crisis. The crisis of mass shootings, of the national debt, of Puerto Rico, Brexit, the Amazon. And, yes, the climate crisis, formerly climate change \u2014 somehow the least tangible but most alarming of the crises, which makes it trickier to talk about.\n\nThose who are talking about it have ratcheted up their rhetoric. In May, the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg ditched \u201cclimate change\u201d for \u201cclimate breakdown\u201d or \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d The Guardian now uses \u201cclimate catastrophe\u201d in its articles. A resistance movement born in Europe last year named itself Extinction Rebellion, partly to normalize the notion of aggressive action in a life-or-death situation.\n\nLuntz wants defter language. \u201cThe strongest advocates for a particular issue are often the worst communicators,\u201d he says later by phone, because \u201cthey forget that the people they need to convince are not themselves or their friends.\u201d\n\nThe climate problem is not just scientific. It\u2019s linguistic. If we can agree how to talk and write about an issue that affects us all, maybe we can understand and fix it together.\n\nBut words can be clumsy tools. They can be too dull to puncture ignorance, or so sharp that people flinch and turn away. Is \u201cchange\u201d appropriately neutral, or unjustly neutered? Is an \u201cemergency\u201d still an \u201cemergency\u201d after months or years? Does \u201ccatastrophe\u201d motivate people, or make them hide under the bed? How long before words such as \u201cbreakdown\u201d and \u201cextinction\u201d lose their bite?\n\nAnd if we keep returning to the dictionary for new words to replace them, will there eventually be any left?\n\nThe second volume of the fourth National Climate Assessment is 1,515 pages long. The word \"likely\" appears 867 times, sometimes after \"very\" or \"extremely.\" Last spring, as they distilled data into text, the scientists who wrote the report spent long hours debating the usage of \"likely.\"\n\nWithout significant action to curb climate change, they wrote in the final chapter, \u201cit is very likely that some physical and ecological impacts will be irreversible for thousands of years, while others will be permanent.\u201d\n\nWhen translated to conversational English, \u201cvery likely\u201d becomes \u201cthis is something really bad and totally crazy and wild,\u201d says one author of the report, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we use plain language and say, \u2018Yes, this is crazy and, yes, you should be freaking out\u2019? Because that\u2019s not fair. That\u2019s not the role of the National Climate Assessment,\u201d the author says. \u201cBut then we sort of fail as a community in actually getting people to understand the severity of it.\u201d\n\nThe science community is supposed to interpret for the rest of us, but its dialect does not always pack rhetorical oomph. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that pointing to a climate graph I think is the Rosetta stone \u2014 people don\u2019t see it the way I see it,\u201d says Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science for the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cWe as humans don\u2019t experience an exponential curve viscerally, in our gut.\u201d\n\nIn the industrial age, environmentalist writers have tried to access the brain via the gut. \u201cThank God men cannot fly, and lay waste the sky as well as the earth,\u201d Henry David Thoreau wrote in the 19th century. In the 1960s, Rachel Carson envisioned an ecosystem silenced by chemicals: \u201cEverywhere was a shadow of death.\u201d In the 1980s, as global warming was first debated widely, Bill McKibben pondered \u201cthe end of nature\u201d itself.\n\nBut \u201cthere\u2019s a point at which words like \u2018climate change\u2019 become part of your mental furniture,\u201d McKibben says in an interview. \u201cLike \u2018urban violence\u2019 \u2014 things that are horrible problems but you just repeat the thing so often that people\u2019s minds kind of skip over them.\u201d\n\nTerms lose their power as they get used over many years, says Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, and \u201ccome to accrete their own set of connotations.\u201d\n\nSuch as: elitist, liberal, socialist. When thousands of pages of analysis become a two-word slogan, it passes from science to politics. Facts become less important than feelings. For some people, \u201cclimate change\u201d is a wedge word synonymous with \u201choax\u201d and calls to mind former vice president Al Gore. For others, it summons the specter of ExxonMobil and is a rallying cry for restructuring the global economy.\n\n[Al Gore is near the end of his quest to save the Earth. Nina Barrett just got started.]\n\n\u201cThe facts do not speak for themselves,\u201d says Richard Buttny, a professor in the department of communication and rhetorical studies at Syracuse University. \u201cPeople make decisions based on values.\u201d\n\nAnd therein lies an opportunity, according to Kim Cobb, professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at Georgia Tech. Scientists observe and publish findings for the public, Cobb says, but then often fail to \u201crecognize the emotional toll this takes on the recipient and the challenge to their core values.\u201d\n\nCobb refrains from using words such as \u201ccrisis\u201d and \u201cemergency\u201d on Twitter, where the character limit discourages context and nuance. Instead, she elevates language about solutions, and about the emotions triggered by the science, in the hopes of widening the circle of understanding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re way behind creating these communities for shared values and shared goals,\u201d Cobb says. \u201cAnd from that comes shared language.\u201d\n\nWe are gradually building that language to talk about where we are, where we're going and about the emotions that accompany that knowledge.\n\nThe Germans have a word for feeling guilty about flying on airplanes: \u201cflugscham,\u201d or \u201cflight shame.\u201d\n\nThe biologist Edward O. Wilson has a word for a future epoch following a profound loss of species: \u201cthe Eremocine,\u201d or \u201cthe Age of Loneliness.\u201d\n\nKarla Brollier, founder of the Climate Justice Initiative, is listening to her fellow indigenous Alaskans as their language evolves to include loss and adaptation, without relying on words such as \u201cclimate refugee\u201d that connote victimhood.\n\nJennifer Atkinson\u2019s students at the University of Washington at Bothell have used \u201cblissonance\u201d to describe the feeling of enjoying a record-hot day in winter \u2014 while recognizing that climate change might have something to do with it.\n\n\u201cSolastalgia,\u201d coined by environmental philosopher Glenn Albrecht, means distress over change in one\u2019s home environment. Atkinson phrases it as a homesickness without ever having left home.\n\nHer students \u201cdescribe how the sound of frogs has slowly disappeared over time \u2014 these changes that destabilize connections to personal memories,\u201d says Atkinson, a senior lecturer at Bothell. \u201cUnlike with personal bereavement, we don\u2019t have a vocabulary for the grief people have for the loss of the natural world.\u201d\n\nHer course is called \u201cEnvironmental Anxiety and Climate Grief.\u201d One of the goals is to search for ways of communicating outside the bounds of science and its \u201cvalue-neutral\u201d vocabulary \u2014 all those likelys and somewhat likelys.\n\n[\u2018Everything is not going to be okay\u2019: How to live with constant reminders that the Earth is in trouble]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving into an age of great earnestness, because we\u2019re trying to figure out, \u2018How do we show up for each other?\u2019 \u201d says Sarah Myhre, a climate and ocean scientist who has studied social and ecological decision-making. \u201cAnd the language that\u2019s being used in my spaces is all about heart-centered work.\u201d\n\nWhereas Frank Luntz once tried to strip the climate problem of emotional resonance, Atkinson, Myhre and others are acknowledging and amplifying it. Whereas science has traditionally been guided by dispassionate, male-centric authority, women are rewording climate conversations to honor the collective, connective nature of the problem.\n\nAnd how we talk about the environment affects how we think about it. In the colonial and industrial ages, Myhre says, our language reflected an idea of the natural world as an inventory of useful commodities \u2014 separate from, and subservient to, humanity.\n\nTrees became timber.\n\nAnimals became livestock.\n\nOil and coal became fuels.\n\nAnd thus a cultural problem has given birth to an environmental one, says Daniel Wildcat, a professor at Haskell Indian Nations University in Kansas.\n\n\u201cThink of how our worldview changes if we shift from thinking that we live in a world full of resources,\u201d he says, \u201cto a world where we live among relatives.\u201d\n\n\n\nProtesters block the street as they gather for a demonstration organized by Extinction Rebellion outside the Brazilian embassy in London on Aug. 23. (Isabel Infantes/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn June, the White House slashed its red pen through certain labels in written congressional testimony from a State Department analyst. When the analyst used \"possibly catastrophic\" to describe the future impacts of climate change, a member of the National Security Council typed a note in the margin: \"not a science-based assessment but advocacy for the climate-alarm establishment.\"\n\nThe analyst listed \u201ctipping point processes\u201d on a page that was entirely crossed out. A note in the margin: \u201c \u2018Tipping points\u2019 is a propaganda slogan designed to frighten the scientifically illiterate.\u201d\n\nSome activists believe fright is appropriate, and they\u2019re eager to use keener language than \u201ctipping points\u201d to do it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been told for years: \u2018Don\u2019t scare people, people don\u2019t want to know the bad news\u2019 \u2014 and all that\u2019s meant is nothing\u2019s changed,\u201d says Charlie Waterhouse, founder of the company behind Extinction Rebellion\u2019s branding. \u201cWe know that we have to up the ante, and we have to have a more extreme position because that opens that crack that lets other people follow.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cextinction\u201d is a blunt instrument that whacks at complacency.\n\nThe word \u201crebellion\u201d invites enlistees and subverts established power structures.\n\nBut this \u201cconstant inflation\u201d in terminology hampers rational discussion, says the Danish author Bjorn Lomborg, whose skeptical writings on the economics of climate action have riled scientists and activists. Words such as \u201ccatastrophe\u201d and \u201cextinction\u201d imply that we should either cower and do nothing, or overreact and do everything, says Lomborg, who is president of the Copenhagen Consensus Center.\n\n\u201cThe conversation we should have is: How do we make smart policies that cost less than the damage they reduce?\u201d Lomborg writes in an email. \u201cClimate policy shouldn\u2019t be done with labels but with careful analysis.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t need labels as much as we used to, back when the effects of climate change were forecast instead of seen and felt.\n\n[Extreme climate change has arrived in America]\n\n\u201cIn a certain sense, words are no longer as necessary as they once were,\u201d says McKibben, author of \u201cThe End of Nature.\u201d \u201cTwenty or 30 years ago we were describing things that hadn\u2019t happened yet, so you couldn\u2019t take a picture of them. Now every single day you can take 1,000 pictures around the world of the trauma of climate change.\u201d\n\nNearly two decades after Frank Luntz recommended it, \u201cclimate change\u201d may still be the closest thing to a shared language that Americans have for describing what\u2019s happening to the planet. But we diverge from there. Scientists speak about consequences. Activists speak about crises and catastrophes. Politicians speak about doubt and propaganda. And if you\u2019re paying attention, you\u2019ll hear nature speaking loudly for itself.", "description": "Climate change isn\u2019t just about the science we trust.
