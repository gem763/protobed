Nothing is ever that easy.\n\nThe Chargers have an unbelievable way of being involved in the strangest outcomes of games, week after week, season after season. Sunday was even weirder than usual.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nAustin Ekeler\u2019s touchdown in the final minute was actually not a touchdown. He was just short of the 1-yard line. Still, the Chargers were at the 1-yard line with plenty of time to win.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nChargers lose in a stunning way, again\n\nEven in the annals of the Chargers\u2019 inconceivable losses, this one was a doozy.\n\nWith 39 seconds left, the Chargers had a false start to move them back to the 6-yard line. That was bad, but then the Titans had a pass interference to put the Chargers back to the 1-yard line.\n\nMelvin Gordon seemed to score a touchdown on the next play. But on review, another score was taken away from the Chargers. He was just short. The Chargers then gave the ball right back to Gordon, who held out to begin the season and hasn\u2019t done much since he came back.\n\nGordon was stopped short of the goal line but ruled down. The Titans thought Gordon fumbled and they recovered. And replay showed that, yes, Gordon fumbled. The Titans took possession. Game over.\n\nThe Chargers had three replay reviews go against them in the final minute, two that took away touchdowns and another that gave the Titans a fumble recovery. The Titans somehow won 23-20.\n\nOnly the Chargers.\n\nThomas Davis Sr. reacts to a play in a loss to the Titans.
