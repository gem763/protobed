It doesn't apply to non-citizen children of U.S. citizens. Refugees and asylum-seekers are also exempt.\n\nHowever, it would apply to the spouses and parents of U.S. citizens and the immediate family members of lawful permanent residents.\n\nThe proclamation is the latest effort by the Trump administration to limit the number of low-income immigrants coming to the United States. The administration also plans to make it harder for immigrants to get green cards if they use a wide range of public benefits. That new rule is set to take effect this month, although it is facing legal challenges.\n\nThe new proclamation is also expected to be challenged.\n\n\"If this policy survives the inevitable court challenges and is implemented, it will create a new and arbitrary hurdle for some half a million green card applicants each year,\" Doug Rand, who worked on immigration policy in the Barack Obama administration, told NPR. \"Consular officers will deny the parents of U.S. citizens based on a snap judgment about their apparent health. U.S. citizens will be separated from their husbands and wives abroad based on a failure to demonstrate health insurance coverage or a subjective level of wealth.\"", "description": "The proclamation issued Friday evening is the latest move by the administration to limit the number of low-income immigrants granted entry to the U.S.", "authors": ["Richard Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/04/ap_19277560269066_wide-ebd5d370aa7e624e68439cdcd32ce45d3c223149.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
