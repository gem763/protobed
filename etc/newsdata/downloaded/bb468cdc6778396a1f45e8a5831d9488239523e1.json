How Should the US Respond?\n\nThe term \u201cOriginal Intentions\u201d is a specific phrase mentioned by Xi during his remarks at the 19th National Congress of the CPC in 2017, after which it became a significant propaganda and educational campaign for party members to stay committed to their party.\n\nAccording to the post, the technology behind the dapp was developed by a Beijing-based company called Lingzhu Technology, which says it\u2019s a blockchain developer without much detail on its tech or the team behind it.\n\nThe company\u2019s registration data shows it has received investment from state-owned capital tied to China\u2019s Tsinghua University and claims it has developed a blockchain called OF.\n\nIn fact, this company issued a little-known cryptocurrency dubbed OFCoin and got it listed on exchanges like OKEx and CoinMex early in 2018, months after China cracked down on initial coin offerings and fiat-to-crypto trading.\n\nRelated: President Xi Says China Should \u2018Seize Opportunity\u2019 to Adopt Blockchain\n\nOFCoin\u2019s price jumped by as much as 90 percent to $0.000326 on Saturday just hours after the CPC released the dapp and said that Lingzhu Technology is behind it. As of writing, the coin has fallen by 35 percent from that peak with just a few million dollars in daily trading volume.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if Lingzhu has conducted any public sale of the tokens. The listing profile on CoinMex states that OFCoin planned a private token sale of 20 percent of its 51.2 billion OFCoin in January 2018 at a ratio of 300,000 OFCoin to 1 ether, when the ether price was about $1,000.\n\nThe rally in OFCoin is just one ripple effect in China from Xi\u2019s speech.\n\nPrimetime news\n\nAfter the Xinhua News Agency published Xi\u2019s comment Friday, Xinwen Lianbo, the country\u2019s most-watched prime-time daily news program on China Central Television (CCTV), devoted five minutes of its 30 minute broadcast to the remark.\n\nOn Saturday, the People\u2019s Daily, an official mouthpiece, published a front-page article with Xi\u2019s comment on \u201caccelerating\u201d blockchain development.\n\nThough state-owned media focused on blockchain technology, the market took it as official endorsement for bitcoin. Its price jumped more than 12 percent on Friday and surged to five-week highs above $10,000, before falling back to above $9,000.\n\nSo fervent was the market response, the CCTV cautioned viewers on Saturday to calm down and not take Xi\u2019s words as endorsement for all cryptocurrency. But the market surge continued anyway.\n\nChinese crypto projects\n\nThere were other signs of increased blockchain and bitcoin interest in China.\n\nSearches for the terms in Chinese on Baidu, the country\u2019s biggest search engine, jumped 200 percent on Saturday, before falling back on Sunday. Similarly, searches on WeChat, China\u2019s dominant mobile messaging platform, saw strong gains following the news on Friday (see image).\n\nAnd, as of writing, several major Chinese-born cryptos, including Qtum, Vechain, Ontology, NEO, Tron and Bytom, were enjoying strong gains on Monday, ranging from 25 percent to 90 percent.\n\nStocks reboot\n\nThe ripple effect has gone beyond crypto, with traded stocks tied blockchain or cryptocurrency seeing even more significant growth.\n\nIn the U.S., the price of Xunlei, a cloud computing firm listed on NASDAQ, shot up by 107 percent. The Shenzhen-based company said it has developed a proprietary high-throughput distributed network based on blockchain technology.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Chinese President Xi Jinping's party is taking his words about the blockchain to heart.", "authors": ["Wolfie Zhao"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FZLLmP7OrkvSeDlGOo3qpQ--~B/aD0xMDAxO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/21ac81bd5c08d84371f2891e0b729098", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
