Keep on pushing. #comeonchelsea #championsleague #J5'.\n\nBatshuayi replied: 'Can I have my balls back please?'\n\nChelsea return to Premier League action on Saturday when they take on Burnley at Turf Moor. Blues will also host Ajax in their next Champions League game on November 5.", "description": "Jorginho was a little overzealous in his celebration of Michy Batshuayi's winning goal in Chelsea's Champions League group stage triumph over Ajax.", "authors": ["Tom Caldon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/10/20123188-0-image-a-9_1571908410629.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
