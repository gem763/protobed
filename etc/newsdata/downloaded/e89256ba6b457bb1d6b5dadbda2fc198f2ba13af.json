We\u2019ll split the analysis into three groups: very cheap, mid-tier, and expensive. A greater emphasis will be placed on the lower end of the price scale.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Stay ahead of the competition from wire to wire with rankings, customizable projections, trade evaluator, exclusive columns and more in our Season Pass.

Beware: the contest starts at 6:35pm ET.\n\nDIRT CHEAP BARGAINS\n\nJared Walsh \u2013 1B \u2013 Los Angeles Angels (at Masahiro Tanaka)\n\nMatt Thaiss \u2013 1B/3B \u2013 Los Angeles Angels (at Masahiro Tanaka)\n\nThe Angels lineup has fallen afoul of the injury gods. Players like Walsh and Thaiss have taken on expanded roles for the stretch run of the season. Yankee Stadium and Tanaka could help to provide a home run or two. Lefty hitters are slugging .285/.331/.507 versus Tanaka this season. He\u2019s struggled with the juiced baseball this season, particularly with gripping his signature splitter.\n\nWalsh is the likelier of the pair to send a deep fly into the night. He\u2019s a fly ball and line drive hitter who makes an inordinate quantity of hard contact. At Triple-A, he launched 36 home runs in 454 plate appearances. While he\u2019s managed only one homer in 65 major league plate appearances, he\u2019s sufficiently proven his power-hitting bonafides. Strikeouts are his main weakness. As an interesting aside, Walsh is also a passable reliever.\n\nStory continues\n\nThaiss, a former first round draft pick, has more name recognition along with a rounded batting profile. He makes frequent pulled contact but doesn\u2019t yet hit enough fly balls to take full advantage. He\u2019ll need to adjust by either inching up his average launch angle or taking a more all-fields approach. The former is likelier than the latter. In Triple-A, Thaiss hit .274/.390/.477 with 14 home runs in 372 plate appearances. His carrying trait was above average plate discipline. He\u2019s had a long look in the majors during which he\u2019s batting a meager .192/.289/.384. His discipline has turned into passivity \u2013 he needs to be more aggressive early in counts.\n\nFranmil Reyes \u2013 OF \u2013 Cleveland Indians (vs Drew VerHagen)\n\nReyes has missed the last two games for a personal matter. Make sure he\u2019s in the lineup before locking him in. If he does happen to start, he\u2019s one of the best picks for power with upside for multiple home runs. All told, Reyes has around a one-in-three chance to go deep versus VerHagen and a terrible Tigers bullpen.\n\nHanser Alberto \u2013 2B/3B \u2013 Baltimore Orioles (vs Anthony Kay)\n\nAt one time, Alberto was in the race for the batting championship (awarded to the hitter with the highest batting average). While he\u2019s fallen back in the standings, his .314 average fueled by one of the highest ball-in-play rates in the league creates interesting DFS potential. Extra base hits and run production are the keys to healthy point totals. Alberto has a strong chance to supply both outcomes while batting out of the leadoff spot. Kay may one day become a useful major league pitcher, but he\u2019s looked overmatched in two starts. A weak bullpen lurks behind him.\n\nAlso Consider: Ryan McBroom, Ryan O\u2019Hearn, Billy McKinney, Yu Chang\n\nMID-TIER MUST PLAYS\n\nAaron Judge \u2013 OF \u2013 New York Yankees (vs Andrew Heaney)\n\nJudge is the rich man\u2019s alternative to Reyes. With a one-in-three chance for a home run and multiple blasts on the table, it would surprise nobody if he contributed a contest-leading point total. Heaney, a southpaw, is a solid pitcher with a spicy strikeout rate. He\u2019s also quite homer prone. Over his career, he has sizable platoon splits including 1.85 HR/9 allowed to right-handed hitters. That\u2019s mostly without this extra juiced ball in the equation. Heaney is interesting in that he\u2019s a ground ball pitcher versus fell southpaws and a fly ball guy against righties. Judge has a tendency to hit grounders, making this an ideal matchup for him.\n\nAlso Consider: Masahiro Tanaka, Rowdy Tellez, Yasiel Puig, Renato Nunez, Jorge Polanco\n\nHIGH PRICED VALUES\n\nMike Clevinger \u2013 SP \u2013 Cleveland Indians (vs Tigers)\n\nHow\u2019s this for an obvious pick. As with Gerrit Cole yesterday, Clevinger is both the most expensive pitcher and the best value. The reason is simple enough \u2013 he\u2019s an elite pitcher with 12.49 K/9 and a 2.68 ERA against a bad Triple-A quality offense. Look for upwards of seven innings and double-digit strikeouts. Of course, this is a blatantly obvious pick made all the more popular by the small slate. A contrarian might avoid him entirely.\n\nAlso Consider: Jack Flaherty, Nelson Cruz, Gleyber Torres", "description": "Brad Johnson finds his favorite MLB DFS bargain targets for Thursday, September 19.
