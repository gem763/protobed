At least not in a hurry.\n\nHer spring/ summer 2020 ready-to-wear show was not so much a big statement about new intentions, as an exercise in subtraction.\n\nGone are all the jokey accessories and off-kilter styling from Lagerfeld\u2019s era. Instead this collection offered a laboratory-like examination of the Chanel codes that Lagerfeld endlessly played with, sometimes to the point of affectionate parody.", "description": "For someone who was recently entrusted with the biggest job in fashion, Virginie Viard, Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s successor at Chanel, doesn\u2019t seem to feel she has much to prove.", "authors": ["Lisa Armstrong", "Head Of Fashion", "Bethan Holt", "Tamara Abraham"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/fashion/2019/10/01/TELEMMGLPICT000211581097-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWNt5ueQwu6gynp0TifCdy2AAaxMzXZc36vVgcB8mo_w.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
