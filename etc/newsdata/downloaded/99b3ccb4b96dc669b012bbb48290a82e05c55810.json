First, all he\u2019s really stating here is the logic of \u201cbad but not impeachable\u201d that\u2019s already been adopted by Republican senators like Rob Portman and Lamar Alexander. The worse the facts get for Trump and the GOP, the more eager Senate Republicans will be to dispense with them altogether and frame their inevitable decision to acquit the president on legal grounds. Yeah, fine, okay, he wanted a quid pro quo with Ukraine in which they\u2019d get their military aid if and only if Trump got some talking points he could use about Joe Biden\u2019s corruption. That\u2019s bad, but it\u2019s not quite so bad that it\u2019s impeachable. That\u2019s an abuse of power, perhaps, but it\u2019s not so abusive that it amounts to a crime. Critics can laugh at Whitaker\u2019s unhelpful phrasing but at the end of the day this is the argument that\u2019ll give enough Senate GOPers cover politically to let Trump off the hook.\n\nSecond, he\u2019s not saying (I think?) that he believes Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine was an abuse of power. He\u2019s addressing the rationale that House Democrats are reportedly planning to use for the final articles of impeachment. Whitaker\u2019s making a constitutional point that\u2019ll resonate with plenty of righties: If the Framers had wanted the president to be removable for \u201cabuse of power,\u201d they wouldn\u2019t have used the language of actual crimes in Article II\u2019s impeachment clause. Treason, bribery, and \u201cother high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are grounds for cutting the executive\u2019s term in office short, not \u201cabuse of power.\u201d Surely Democrats need to show that Trump committed an actual crime, no?\n\nThe problem with arguing that impeachment shouldn\u2019t take place absent proof of a crime is that there are probably nightmare scenarios we could concoct for presidential behavior in which (a) no crime has been committed but also (b) the president obviously needs to be stripped of his power before he does more damage. A natsec lawyer who knows the U.S. Code could probably think of half a dozen off the top of their heads, but here\u2019s one that occurs to me that might qualify: What if the president decided to share the nuclear codes with a friend/girlfriend, either for a laugh or to impress them? Would that be a crime? It\u2019s not treason because the friend isn\u2019t an enemy of the United States. It\u2019s not leaking classified information because the president can\u2019t leak, by definition. He\u2019s authorized to declassify any information he wants. It\u2019s not bribery because he received nothing in return for sharing the information. So what\u2019s the crime?\n\nThere\u2019s no crime \u2014 I think. But should a president who did something as reckless as sharing the nuclear codes nonetheless be impeached for it? Yes, of course. For the simple reason that if he\u2019s willing to cross that line once, he might be willing to cross it again \u2014 or to cross an entirely different, even worse line if allowed to remain in office. Whether you want to call it \u201cabuse of power\u201d or something else, I think that\u2019s the basic question on impeachment and removal: Is the president guilty of behavior so alarming and inappropriate that we can\u2019t trust him to carry out his duties responsibly going forward? If it\u2019s true that Trump was using military aid to squeeze a foreign country to help give him an advantage over the Democratic frontrunner in the upcoming election, then sure, one might reason that he\u2019ll continue to abuse his power as president over the next year to increase his advantage. You can\u2019t leave it to voters in that case to issue a verdict on his behavior since the very improprieties he\u2019s accused of are aimed at affecting the vote itself.\n\nBut like I say, Whitaker and the GOP have an answer to that. If the Framers wanted to make \u201calarming behavior\u201d impeachable, they would have said that. Where\u2019s the \u201chigh crime or misdemeanor\u201d?\n\nTrump\u2019s not getting convicted but that doesn\u2019t mean this fiasco won\u2019t end helping Democrats politically. A new Quinnipiac poll today finds support for the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry rising to 55 percent and support for impeachment itself inching up to 48 percent. Meanwhile Reuters finds support for impeachment at 46/40, with independents at 45/32. If Pelosi gets out of this with nothing worse happening to her party than the Senate letting Trump off the hook and most of the public believing that he did something bad enough to warrant removal, she\u2019ll consider it a moral victory and a boost for the 2020 effort to oust Trump.\n\nUpdate: Chris Field of the Blaze reminds me that \u201cabuse of power\u201d was sufficiently impressive to House Republicans as grounds for impeachment 20 years ago that they included it in the final articles against Bill Clinton.", "description": "High crimes.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/m-8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
