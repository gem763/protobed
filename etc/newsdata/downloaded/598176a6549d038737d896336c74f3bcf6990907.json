In the end, the images have that quality, not knowing whether or not someone has been painted or photographed.\u201d\n\nIn the surreal images, which effectively encapsulate the LA-based brand\u2019s fantastical romanticism, the Haim sisters sport three complementary sparkly dresses, while Roma actor Aparicio wears a monochromatic cloque gown.\n\nElsewhere, Mad Men stars January Jones and Kiernan Shipka rekindle their former on-screen mother-daughter relationship as they embrace wearing strapless floral frocks and matching pearl-encrusted sheer gloves.\n\nThe comprehensive lookbook also features Reinhart cuddling a puppy, Union in a princess-like gown and Dunst in a gauzy mint green-coloured ball gown.\n\nWhen it came to choosing the cast for this season\u2019s look book, the designers looked to their friends and the women who inspire them, admitting that there is always a special place in their hearts for Dunst.\n\n\u201cKnowing Kirsten, we have such a sister relationship with her,\u201d Laura said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so important in our lives, shooting anything with her is so emotional. The moment we had her on set here was just a very special part of the day. She just has the most magic heart.\u201d", "description": "For spring/summer 2020, Rodarte designers Laura and Kate Mulleavy have decided to forgo a traditional runway show.\u00a0 Instead, this season the sisters will be presenting their new collection via private appointments in New York and through a series of super-ethereal portraits.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/06/09/yalitza-aparicio.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
