Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)\u2019s \u201cviral\u201d answer on faith and traditional marriage at last week\u2019s Human Rights Campaign (HRC) LGBT town hall was a maximum donor of the Massachusetts lawmaker.\n\nWarren made waves last week after Morgan Cox III, the chair of the HRC board of directors, asked Warren how she would respond to a supporter if he or she approached her and said, \u201cSenator, I\u2019m old-fashioned and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.'\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that,\u201d Warren said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to say, \u2018Then just marry one woman.\u2019 I\u2019m cool with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAssuming you can find one,\u201d she added, prompting laughs.\n\nWarren\u2019s answer went viral, with her campaign touting over 12 million views in 15 hours (across multiple media platforms):\n\nA spokeswoman from the Warren campaign says this video from last night's CNN Town Hall has amassed 12 million views in 15 hours, accounting for all the places it's been posted. #IACaucus https://t.co/bnSewVHkxL \u2014 Kim Norvell (@KimNorvellDMR) October 11, 2019\n\nCNN described Cox as the chair to the HRC board of directors and noted his involvement with \u201ca real estate investment firm in Dallas, Texas.\u201d However, CNN failed to mention Cox\u2019s status as a Warren donor.\n\nDonor data matching Cox\u2019s profile indicates that he donated $2,700 to Warren in July 2017 and $2,700 in April 2018.\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon reports:\n\nFEC filings show that a \u201cMorgan Cox III\u201d from Plano, Tex., who listed his occupation as \u201cinvestor\u201d donated the legal maximum of $2,700 to Warren\u2019s Senate primary campaign in 2017, followed by two donations totaling $2,700 to her general election campaign the following year. Cox also donated $2,700 to the Elizabeth Warren Action Fund PAC. Records show that a \u201cMorgan W. Cox III\u201d who donated to the Human Rights Campaign and listed his employer as the Marquis Group also donated to Democratic congressional candidates Gina Ortiz Jones (Tex.), Jennifer Wexton (Va.), Nancy Soderberg (Fla.), and Annie Craig (Minn.). There is no evidence Cox has donated to any other 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nNonetheless, CNN failed to detail Cox\u2019s status as a Warren donor. This, as Free Beacon notes, would not be the first time CNN has come under fire for failing to sufficiently disclose the affiliations of its town hall attendees:\n\nThe lack of disclosure comes after CNN was criticized in February for not disclosing the Democratic Party ties of town hall participants who asked harsh questions of outsider presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), including identifying the Baltimore County Democratic Party chairwoman as a \u201cformer biology professor.\u201d\n\nThe network admitted that it \u201cshould have more fully identified any political affiliations\u201d following the town hall controversy in February.\n\n\u201cThough we said at the beginning of the Town Hall that the audience was made up of Democrats and Independents, we should have more fully identified any political affiliations,\u201d a CNN spokesperson told Fox News at the time.", "description": "CNN failed to mention that the questioner who set up Warren's \"viral\" answer at last week's LGBT town hall was\u00a0a maximum donor.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Elizabeth-Warren-2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
