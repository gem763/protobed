Some Call Vice President Mike Pence's Flouting Vehicle Ban 'Disrespectful'", "language": "en", "text": "Michigan\u2019s Mackinac Island is a historic community of strong traditions. It\u2019s best known for its Victorian cottages, fudge shops \u2014 and a firm ban on driving.\n\nAlthough residents can receive a temporary vehicle permit, and the police own at least one vehicle, residents and visitors traverse Mackinac on bicycles, snowmobiles or on foot. The only sitting President to visit the island, Gerald Ford, traveled by horse-drawn carriage.\n\nNow, Vice President Mike Pence is under fire for traveling in what might be the first motorcade in the island\u2019s history. This weekend Pence traveled via SUV, and was reportedly accompanied by seven other vehicles, to the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference.\n\nVice President Mike Pence leaves the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island Saturday in an eight-vehicle motorcade \u2014 the island\u2019s first ever. pic.twitter.com/p0IgewX09K \u2014 Paul Egan (@paulegan4) September 21, 2019\n\nThe vehicle ban has been in place on the island for about 121 years.\n\nA ferry service that provides transportation to the island, Shepler\u2019s Ferry, tweeted photos of its boat transporting the Vice President\u2019s vehicles.\n\nIt was our honor to transport the @VP\u2019s emergency vehicles to Mackinac Island this weekend. Regardless of your political views, we hope you\u2019ll understand the logistical intricacies involved in securing our leaders while visiting. We were happy to assist. \u26f4\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #RideSheplers pic.twitter.com/yqYrrrHhrn \u2014 Shepler's Ferry (@sheplersferry) September 22, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some wrote on social media that the community was honored to host the Vice President, others characterized Pence\u2019s mode of transportation as disrespectful.\n\n\u201cFor those not from MI, you should understand what a huge transgression this is. Our #MackinacIsland has been a car-free haven forever, a piece of history frozen in time. Tell anyone from MI @VP just drove not 1 but 8 CARS on this island & watch their blood boil,\u201d wrote Julia Pulver, a former Michigan State Senate Candidate, on Twitter.\n\nFor those not from MI, you should understand what a huge transgression this is.\n\n\n\nOur #MackinacIsland has been a car free haven forever, a piece of history frozen in time.

But, I do recognize security issues like this may require them. Is there another way? Thoughts?\u201d wrote journalist Alicia Rancilio.\n\nBeing from Michigan, the idea of cars on Mackinac Island makes me wince. But, I do recognize security issues like this may require them.

Anthony brought a vehicle onto the island.
