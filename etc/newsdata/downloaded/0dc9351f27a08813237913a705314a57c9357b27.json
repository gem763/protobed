It's now a fraction of a percent from record highs. Thursday's futures prices were pointing higher after President Donald Trump and China offered conciliatory moves in their trade war.\n\nSaut, who has $1.5 billion in assets under management, contends the fear dynamic over the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, inverted Treasury yield curve and global growth fears are dissipating for good.\n\n\"Our work suggests where interest rates are right now that a fair market multiple on the S&P is 19 times earnings.,\" he said. \"You're still looking at above 3,100 on the S&P by year-end.\"\n\nKnown for his basket of proprietary indicators, Saut has been tracking the markets for almost a half century. He's been adamant \u2014 even during pullbacks \u2014 that the current bull market has years left.\n\n\"I've never wavered since October of 2008,\" Saut said. \"We're in a secular bull market.\"\n\nAs for the best plays to capitalize off the market's next leg higher, Saut lists consumer cyclicals, energy and particularly financials as S&P groups for investors to consider.\n\n\"Financials came on strong yesterday, and they're cheap stocks,\" Saut said in Wednesday's interview. \"Good things tend to happen to cheap stocks.\"\n\nDisclaimer", "description": "Capital Wealth Planning's Jeff Saut believes the market just made a major breakthrough.", "authors": ["Stephanie Landsman"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104623489-GettyImages-810836674-bull.jpg?v=1568234893", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
