But not turned off.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe trash talk never stops, either. After the Clippers dismantled the Warriors on the night Golden State opened its gleaming new Chase Center in San Francisco, Beverley trash talked a couple of the staff members cleaning up the arena, taking a shot at what the Warriors look like without Kevin Durant. Via Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports.\n\nIn the Clippers\u2019 locker room, Patrick Beverley was having some fun with some of the arena staff workers who help tidy up the facility. \u201cY\u2019all a little different without KD, I see,\u201d Beverley playfully jabbed. \u201cUh-huh, y\u2019all cheated long enough. It\u2019s OK. Y\u2019all had a good run. Back to reality.\u201d\n\nOuch.\n\nAnd he\u2019s right.\n\nYes, the Warriors are also without Klay Thompson for at least most, if not all, of this season.

Things will smooth out, the defense will improve.\n\nHowever, Thursday night the Clippers provided a stark contrast from where the Warriors were and where they are now. It\u2019s a bit shocking to the system.\n\nAnd the Warriors are a little different without KD.
