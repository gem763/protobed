Urban Meyer is not one of those coaches.\n\nAppearing Friday on Colin Cowherd\u2019s radio show, Meyer made it clear that he\u2019s interested in the Cowboys job.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s New York Yankees, that\u2019s the Dallas Cowboys,\u201d Meyer initially said regarding the question of whether Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley would or should want the job, via Jon Machota of TheAthletic.com. \u201cThat\u2019s the one. Great city. They got Dak Prescott, Zeke Elliott. You got a loaded team. And I can\u2019t speak for him obviously, I hate to even speculate because I don\u2019t know him, that\u2019s really not fair, but to me, that\u2019s the one job in professional football that you say, \u2018I got to go do that.'\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRegardless of whether Riley would want the job, it\u2019s clear that Meyer would.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cAbsolutely. Absolutely. That one? Yes.\u201d\n\nOf course, the job currently is filled. It belongs to Jason Garrett. And Cowboys ownership has done nothing to suggest that Garrett is in danger of losing it. (Other than, that is, not extending his contract, which expires after the current season.)\n\nMaking Meyer\u2019s public pitch for the Cowboys job even more confusing is the fact that he supposedly left Ohio State because of an arachnoid cyst that, coupled with stress, was causing headaches.\n\nWhile the Ohio State job surely entails a certain amount of stress, it\u2019s nothing compared to coaching the team that continues to be at the epicenter of the NFL, even though 24 years have passed since they last appeared in a conference championship game.", "description": "Many coaches would never comment publicly about a job that is currently filled by someone else.
