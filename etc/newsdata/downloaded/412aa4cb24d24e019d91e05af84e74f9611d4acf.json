(Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nPresident Trump congratulated China on the 70th anniversary of Communist rule there in a tweet that belies America\u2019s foreign policy position and ignores decades of human rights abuses.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China!\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.\n\nShortly thereafter, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney (Wyo.) released a statement contradicting the president, and pointing to the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s oppressive governing tactics.\n\n\u201cThis is not a day for celebration,\u201d Cheney said in a joint statement with Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.). The United States will use the occasion to \u201crededicate ourselves to ensuring that the Chinese Communist Party is left on the ash heap of history,\u201d they added.\n\nTrump\u2019s cheerful commemoration of China came as pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong against Chinese rule turned violent and one teenage protester was shot by police.\n\n[Protester shot as police disperse anti-China protests in Hong Kong]\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) also released a statement that deeply contrasted with the Republican president.\n\n\u201cToday Chinese tyrants celebrated 70 years of communist oppression with their typically brutal symbolism: by sending a police officer to shoot a pro-democracy protester at point-blank range,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cThe freedom-seekers in Hong Kong mourn this anniversary, and the American people stand with them against those who deny their God-given dignity.\u201d\n\nAnd Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said, \u201cFrom the Great Leap Forward to the Cultural Revolution to the camps in Xinjiang today, it has been a ghoulish 70 years of Chinese Communist Party control.\u201d\n\nEven congressional allies of Trump, like Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.) took issue with Trump\u2019s tweet. \u201cI will pass,\u201d Roy tweeted about offering his congratulations.\n\nTrump\u2019s critics on Twitter blasted him over his celebratory tweet for China.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to the people of Hong Kong for standing up for freedom. And best wishes to the people of China for freedom and democracy in the near future,\u201d wrote conservative columnist Bill Kristol.\n\nAnother conservative writer, Dan McLaughlin, similarly responded to Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t celebrate the Soviet revolution in Russia, the Nazi takeover of Germany, or the Khmer Rouge taking power in Cambodia,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cFor the same reasons, I do not celebrate Chairman Mao\u2019s revolution in China.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s relationship with Xi has been rocky. Trump has called the Chinese president a friend, and yet, in the midst of a protracted trade war between the nations, Trump recently referred to Xi as an enemy.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s congratulatory tweet to Xi as the leader oversaw a massive military parade appeared rather chummy.\n\n[China marks Communist Party\u2019s 70th anniversary with grand show of power]", "description": "\u201cCongratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China!\u201d President Trump tweeted.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/w3h-76Mb2J6rlFlmn60P523S3Qs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FVSOV3XEKYI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
