The two had already been legally married for a year, but they celebrated their one-year anniversary with a religious ceremony and banging reception in South Carolina. Photos from the event have been pretty scant. But finally, Hailey Bieber uploaded a photo of her wedding dress to Instagram, and her veil is the next-level ish we were expecting.\n\nAccording to Hailey\u2019s caption, her lace, off-the-shoulder dress was designed by Virgil Abloh, head designer and Chief Executive Officer of the Off-White brand.\n\nundefined\n\nAbloh also uploaded pics of the final product on October 7th. He wrote in his Instagram caption, \u201cwhen @haileybieber asks if you want to design a wedding dress\u2026 that\u2019s a \u2018yes\u2019 too. love you guys since time, for time.\u201d\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a Bieber wedding without an over-the-top element. So, Abloh embroidered \u201cTill Death Do Us Part\u201d on Hailey\u2019s veil.\n\n\u201clast Monday was the most special day of my life:)\u201d Hailey captioned her veil pic.\n\nAbloh even uploaded the design sketch to show us how the dress transformed from idea to finished product.\n\nAnd Hailey also showed off that massive rock Justin gave her more than a year ago.\n\nWho needs vows when you can embroider a veil? We have a feeling Hailey Bieber and Virgil Abloh may have just started a new trend, and TBH, we\u2019re here for the extra-ness.", "description": "Hailey Bieber just shared photos of her designer wedding dress on Instagram and OMG \u2014 the embroidered veil is everything.", "authors": ["Olivia Harvey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PLE4CZStZOspKVyY4T621Q--~B/aD01NzA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hello_giggles_454/afbfd900862b18474d895ac9d5b40389", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
