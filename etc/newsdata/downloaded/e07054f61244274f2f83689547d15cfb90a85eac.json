Joe Schmidt\u2019s side has garnered a healthy 66% win-loss ratio over the last three years against the All Blacks, claiming famous victories over Steve Hansen\u2019s side in 2016 and 2018.\n\nThe New Zealanders head into the quarter-finals as one of four undefeated sides - alongside England, Wales and Japan \u2013 at the tournament, winning all three of their Pool B clashes unaffected by Typhoon Hagibis. Ireland, meanwhile, finished second in Pool A after tripping up at a Japan-shaped hurdle during round two.\n\nDespite heading into today\u2019s second for playoff games this weekend off the back of poor form tracing back to the 2019 Six Nations last February, Ireland have opted for the old faces that saw them rise to tournament favourites at the end of 2018. Schmidt has kept faith with out-of-form Munster blindside flanker Peter O\u2019Mahony and number eight CJ Stander, resisting the lure of a backrow reshuffle off the back of a number of poor backrow performances.\n\nSteve Hansen, meanwhile, has held fast with his decision to start the inexperienced Crusaders wing pairing of Sevu Reece and George Bridge alongside former starting fly-half turned playmaking fullback, Beauden Barrett. Hansen doubled down on his selection surprises by dropping 83-cap fullback/wing Ben Smith from the 23 entirely, opting for the youngest of the Barrett brothers, Jordie, in the 23 jersey.\n\n\"The best part is we know who we're playing. They're [Ireland] a quality side, they've been No. 1 this year.\u201d Hansen said ahead of facing Ireland this week.", "description": "Sexton kicks-off the second 40 to an All Blacks side with one change.", "authors": ["Ali Stokes", "Will Greenwood"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213468750-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
