The move does not necessarily end his political career or his chances of leading the country\u2019s next administration.\n\nHowever, the stalemate has wounded the prime minister, especially as he has become more deeply embroiled in three potential corruption cases. Israel\u2019s attorney general is expected to announce in the coming weeks if he plans to indict.\n\nThe charges add pressure on Netanyahu to remain in high office. If he retains the role of prime minister, he will not be required to step down, even if indicted. Netanyahu has denied all allegations.\n\nQuick guide The police investigations swirling around Netanyahu Show Hide The Israeli PM is embroiled in four cases involving allegations of bribery and misconduct. He denies wrongdoing in every instance. Case 1000 is an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne. Case 2000 is examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper. Case 3000 is an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle.\n\nCase 4000, the most serious, involves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.\n\nTo block Gantz\u2019s chances, Netanyahu reportedly planned to meet smaller rightwing and religious parties to get them to agree not to ally with the opposition leader.\n\nOne route for Gantz to form a government would be to make a deal with Avigdor Lieberman, whose eight seats afford him kingmaker status, and gain support from Arab parties. However, Lieberman, a staunch ultranationalist regularly accused of racism, has described Arab politicians as \u201cenemies\u201d.\n\nLieberman, Rivlin, Netanyahu and Gantz all say they want a unity government, possibly with a rotating premiership, but they are divided on how to achieve it.\n\nBlue and White argues Gantz should be prime minister first under any arrangement as his party won the most seats, finishing with 33 compared with Likud\u2019s 32 in the 120-seat Knesset.\n\nGantz also says Blue and White cannot serve in a government with a prime minister facing serious indictment.", "description": "Ex-military chief expected to have 28 days to forge coalition and avoid third election in year", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c132867b45dab00b3e1924eb6c9327547d3e641e/0_214_3352_2011/master/3352.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a32ed5d992a8c18eea28f46eff093529", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
