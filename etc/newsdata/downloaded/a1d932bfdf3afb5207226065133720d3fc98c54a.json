He asked viewers to wear purple in November and spread awareness on social media\n\nTrebek says he decided to join forces with the World Pancreatic Cancer Coalition to make the PSA because 'more attention and awareness are needed' to help patients 'fight and survive this disease.'\n\nHe asked viewers 'to join me in this fight' by wearing purple in November and 'spreading the word on social media'.\n\nHe ends by saying: ''Together, we can get it done.'\n\nPancreatic cancer is caused by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells in the pancreas, a large gland in the digestive system.\n\nIt typically doesn't show symptoms in the early stages. Sufferers tend to develop signs, such as back pain and jaundice, when it has spread to other organs.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, around 56,000 will be diagnosed in the US in 2019, and around 45,000 will die from it.\n\nLess than seven percent of patients survive five years, which means pancreatic cancer has one of the worst survival rates of all common cancers.\n\nTrebek revealed in a video message posted on the YouTube page of Jeopardy! on March 6 of his diagnosis.\n\n'I...wanted to prevent you from reading or hearing some overblown or inaccurate reports regarding my health,' he told fans.\n\nTrebek revealed he was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer in a video message posted to YouTube in March 2019.

Because under the terms of my contract, I have to host Jeopardy! for three more years!\n\n'So help me. Keep the faith and we'll win. We'll get it done. Thank you.'\n\nAfter news this past spring that his tumors had shrunk in half and that he was near remission, Trebek told ABC's 'Good Morning America' that he was undergoing chemotherapy again.\n\n'There are moments when, for no reason at all, I feel this surge of sadness, depression,' he said. 'It doesn't last for very long, but it takes over your whole being for a period of time.'\n\nHe added that he has developed mouth sores that make it hard to enunciate and that, in the future, he may need to stop hosting Jeopardy! as a result.", "description": "Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek, 79, appeared in a PSA on YouTube to raise awareness about the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer and asked viewer to 'join me in this fight'.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/16/20385976-0-image-a-23_1572452936609.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
