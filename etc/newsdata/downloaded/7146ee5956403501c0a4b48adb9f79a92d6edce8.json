The younger children are having a snack before starting their after-school activities. Upstairs a group of 12-year-olds are in a craft class, cutting patterns and making clothes on sewing machines.\n\nOutside, children play in an enormous outdoor space, equipped with a climbing frames, football pitches and basketball courts. \u201cHey, Petteri,\u201d one boy yells casually at the principal, Petteri Kuusim\u00e4ki. \u201cNext year can we start school a bit later, at 10am?\u201d Kuusim\u00e4ki jokes with them. It\u2019s all first names here.\n\nThe Finnish education system is the envy of the world. Along with Tove Jansson\u2019s Moomins, Nokia phones and Iittala glassware, it has become one of the country\u2019s most celebrated exports \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to see why.\n\nIts students score consistently score at the top end of the Pisa international league tables, and as Kuusim\u00e4ki walks me round his school he describes a kind of education utopia \u2013 a place where teachers are highly trained, revered and trusted, and children\u2019s wellbeing is paramount.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pupils in the school cafeteria at lunchtime. Photograph: Miikka Pirinen/The Guardian\n\nThere are no Ofsted-style inspections, no streaming by ability, no national exams until 18, no school uniforms, no school league tables and no fee-paying private schools.\n\nAt its party conference this week, Labour committed to follow Finland\u2019s lead and not only scrap Ofsted but abolish private schools by forcing them to integrate them in the state sector. Explaining the policy, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4: \u201cIn some countries, it is not allowed to charge for education in any form \u2026 in Finland, for example.\u201d\n\nThe British Labour party is far from alone in its enthusiasm for the Finnish education system. Every year hundreds of delegations of teachers and policymakers from all over the world pour into Helsinki to see this nirvana for themselves. So popular has it become that international visits are strictly regulated and have to be paid for \u2013 a presentation costs \u20ac682 (\u00a3607) per hour and a school visit \u20ac1,240.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A classroom discussion.

In the coming weeks there will be visits from New Zealand and Lithuania.\n\nMeanwhile, Finland\u2019s influence is spreading far and wide. Last month a school opened in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam based on the Finnish curriculum and pedagogical approach, with Finnish staff on the teaching team.\n\nKuusim\u00e4ki tells me Finland\u2019s schools are well-funded and built around the principle of equality of opportunity for all pupils. He is baffled when I try to explain that some state schools in England are so strapped for cash that they are asking parents for donations. \u201cAs you may know, everything is free in Finland,\u201d he says, university included.\n\nThere is just one fee-paying school in the country, the International School of Helsinki, which has mainly catered for international employees of Nokia and other industries. Otherwise, charging fees is illegal and parents are happy by and large to send their children to their local school. \u201cWe really don\u2019t have bad schools,\u201d Kuusim\u00e4ki says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pupils hang out in the school yard. The school has an array of climbing frames, football pitches and basketball courts. Photograph: Miikka Pirinen\n\nIn class children are listened to and respected, school lunches are free, detentions are rare and exclusions pretty much unheard of. Kuusim\u00e4ki gave his last detention 15 years ago, and is visibly horrified at the idea of excluding a child from school. \u201cAs a principal, you can\u2019t think like that. We are responsible for these children and their lives. We can\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nBut things are changing slowly. Schools are becoming more diverse \u2013 20% of pupils at Lintulaakson school are from immigrant backgrounds, elsewhere it is 75%. The curriculum has been revised and Kuusim\u00e4ki says more has had to be done to stretch gifted children.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Principal Petteri Kuusim\u00e4ki gave his last detention 15 years ago.

Meanwhile, parents \u201cshopping for schools\u201d is on the increase.\n\nFinnish education experts would be the first to admit they do not have all the answers and methods in one country do not always translate to another. John Jerrim, professor of education and social statistics at the University College London Institute of Education, does not believe England should be looking to Finland. \u201cIts Pisa scores have actually been in decline. And there is no reason to believe their high scores on international tests are due to their schools. So there is no reason to try to copy Finland.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Second-graders Menni Pietil\u00e4inen (left) and Nathan Mulote.

Once a maths and science teacher in Helsinki, Sahlberg now tours the world spreading the word about the wonders of Finnish education and advising on education reform.\n\n\u201cIt was like going 200 years backwards in time,\u201d Sahlberg recalls of his visit. \u201cI remember thinking while walking the corridors of Eton and watching students there that even if I had a chance to enrol my own kids to that school I would probably say \u2018no, thank you\u2019.\u201d\n\nWith its illustrious history, bizarre uniforms and \u00a340,000 a year fees, Eton \u2013 which educated the current British prime minister and many before him \u2013 is a million miles from the modern egalitarianism of Finland\u2019s schools.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Second-grader Menni Pietil\u00e4inen reads a book after official school hours. Photograph: Miikka Pirinen\n\n\u201cI am often asked by people what is the most important thing I learned in school,\u201d Sahlberg says. \u201cI say that to learn to understand that there are different kinds of people in this world and that regardless where we come from we can be in same school and learn in same classroom. Eton boys won\u2019t learn that in their school.\u201d\n\nLike Jerrim, Sahlberg is sceptical about other countries trying to simply copy the Finland model. \u201cThere are so many myths about what the Finnish system is and is not. This idea of copying has done a lot of damage.\u201d Finland\u2019s schools are rooted in the country\u2019s distinctive history and culture; the population is small (5.5 million), and taxes are high.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go to Finland and cherry-pick the things that seem to be interesting and say, \u2018We want to do like Finland is doing\u2019. It\u2019s much more complicated than that.\u201d He also thinks it\u2019s unrealistic for Labour to promise to abolish private schools. \u201cIt\u2019s come too far this whole private education thinking. It\u2019s very hard to remove it altogether.\u201d\n\nIt would be better, he says, for Labour to focus on strengthening the existing state sector in England, which has become fragmented through academisation and free schools. \u201cJust abolishing something, saying private schools should be made illegal, it\u2019s not going happen.\u201d", "description": "With no Ofsted-style inspections, uniforms or league tables, the country\u2019s education system is now one of its most celebrated exports", "authors": ["Sally Weale", "Rachel Kelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d047ca6365a57f03621bf8ab91c5538445ab34ee/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2f6bea8d53aa23721f8219783b2b8dd5", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
