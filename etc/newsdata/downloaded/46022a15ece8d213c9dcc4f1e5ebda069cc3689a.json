It would be a brave call to line up like that against a Liverpool side with such a potent strike force.\n\n\u201cWith Liverpool they have an amazing front three in (Roberto) Firmino, (Mo) Salah and (Sadio) Mane but when they don\u2019t have the ball they have the likes of (Jordan) Henderson and (James) Milner... to give balance,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBalance is the most important thing and we are trying to find the right balance, that\u2019s why we rotate. We showed better balance against Red Star, but still we need to be more solid.\u201d\n\nThough the memory of the Champions League final is still fresh, Pochettino played down any suggestion that it would act as extra motivation for Sunday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cIn football, if the job of the coaching staff is to motivate the players then something is wrong,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more that we need to provide the tools, to inspire them and prepare them in a good way. If someone is not motivated then we have a big, big problem.\u201d\n\nAt least Pochettino has a full squad to choose from with only keeper Hugo Lloris out injured.\n\nArgentine Giovani Lo Celso came on against Red Star and could be in the reckoning while Danny Rose and Toby Alderweireld, left out of the squad on Tuesday, could return to the defence.", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino said he is happy his Tottenham Hotspur players have rediscovered the winning feeling as they head to Anfield to face Premier League leaders Liverpool on Sunday.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444890734&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O17W", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
