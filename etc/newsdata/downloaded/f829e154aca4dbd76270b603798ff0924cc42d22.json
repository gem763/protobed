Lydia Hart (Karen Blick) eventually arrived to free him from the Mill and Aaron\u2019s own desperate situation was temporarily forgotten as he and Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele) raced with Paddy to the Woolpack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the point that Paddy arrives, Chas is well on her way to welcoming the new life to the world. And they are all still waiting for Mandy (Lisa Riley) to break into the toilets with her trusty crowbar so it\u2019s a race against time for Paddy to be there for the moment he has dreamed of.\n\nWe can\u2019t reveal whether Paddy and Chas will be with one another when their child arrives but we can confirm that all will be okay with the new baby and, after a very stressful day, the couple unite and cradle their beloved new baby.\n\nAs they wistfully bask in happiness, they know that Grace will be so happy to meet her new sibling \u2013 but despite being exhausted, Chas isn\u2019t forgetting her other child\u2019s heartache as she strives to give Aaron strength ahead of Robert\u2019s hearing.\n\nIf ever there was a supermum\u2026\n\nEmmerdale airs the birth on Wednesday 23rd October at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Paddy faces a race against time.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/paddy-and-chas-birth-3dd9_1571837416.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
