In the vast majority of cases, however, the suspensions came not after any kind of serious investigation but because app developers had failed to respond to emailed information requests.\n\nStarting in March 2018, Facebook began looking into the apps that have access to its users\u2019 data. The probe came after revelations that data mining firm Cambridge Analytica used ill-gotten data from millions of Facebook users through an app, then used the data to try to influence U.S. elections.\n\nIt led to a massive backlash against Facebook that included CEO Mark Zuckerberg being called to testify before Congress. The company is still trying to repair its reputation.\n\nFacebook said Friday its app investigation is ongoing and it has looked at millions of apps so far.\n\nThe company said it has banned a few apps completely and has filed lawsuits against some, including in May against a South Korean data analytics company called Rankwave. In April, it sued LionMobi , based in Hong Kong, and JediMobi, based in Singapore, which the company says made apps that infected users\u2019 phones with malware.\n\nFacebook settled with the Federal Trade Commission for a record $5 billion this summer over privacy violations that stemmed from the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The company said the FTC agreement \u201cwill bring its own set of requirements for bringing oversight to app developers. It requires developers to annually certify compliance with our policies\u201d and that developers who don\u2019t do this will be \u201cheld accountable.\u201d\n\nAlso on Friday, a judge unsealed a subpoena by the Massachusetts attorney general demanding that the social network disclose the names of apps and developers that obtained data from its users without their consent. It also asked for all Facebook internal communications about those apps.\n\nThe state began investigating Facebook when the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. But the company refused to identify any of the apps or developers, and the subpoena would have remained confidential under Massachusetts law had Facebook not insisted on keeping it and related exhibits secret.\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey\u2019s consumer protection division had sought data on apps from prior to 2014, when Facebook announced changes to the platform to restrict access to user data.\n\nFacebook tried to redact the subpoena in negotiations before Friday\u2019s ruling by state Judge Brian A. Davis. But Healey\u2019s office fought to limit the redacted sections.\n\nFacebook did disclose that it had identified more than 10,000 apps that \u201cshow characteristics associated with higher risks of data misuse\u201d but did not identify any of them.\n\nThe state attorney general noted that Facebook had allowed developers to integrate at least 9 million apps into the platform as of 2014 and had, for many years, allowed developers to access user data, including photos, work history, birthdates and \u201clikes.\u201d This applied not just from people who installed the apps but also to their Facebook friends who did not.\n\nThe unsealed subpoena also says that Facebook informed the Massachusetts attorney general\u2019s office that it had identified about 2 million apps \u201cas warranting a closer examination for potential misuses of Facebook user data.\u201d\n\nThat suggests that, five years ago, more than one in four apps may have been accessing Facebook users\u2019 data without their knowledge or consent.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Facebook said Friday that it has suspended \"tens of thousands\" of apps made by about 400 developers as part of an investigation following the Cambridge Analytica scandal.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barbara Ortutay", "Frank Bajak"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/facebook_app_suspensions_38204_c0-128-2039-1316_s1770x1032.jpg?14ec3c18ffacef660c374bfc1330041f6a6f7f41", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
