For others, it\u2019s a reliable daily commuter, and a bike can even be a great way to stay in shape and shed a few pounds. Cannondale\u2019s new Treadwell EQ makes a strong case that a bike can be all three of those things, and at a price that doesn\u2019t make you feel like you should be competing in the Tour de France to justify what you spent.\n\nCannondale Treadwell EQ WHAT IS IT? A bike designed for casual riders who still want to track their performance. PRICE $US635 ($939) to $US950 ($1,405), depending on size and accessories. LIKE An extremely comfortable ride and streamlined stat tracking. DISLIKE A challenge to assemble and the app could use some polish.\n\nAfter a recent transition to suburbia I sought out a new bike this past summer to help get my butt off the sofa. Wandering through my local cycle shop I\u2019ll admit I was sorely tempted by the streamlined and impossibly lightweight carbon fibre creations of Cannondale, one of the few bike brands I actually recognise. But as a novice cyclist, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to committing thousands of dollars on a bike designed for competitive and dedicated athletes.\n\nBut Cannondale doesn\u2019t only make bikes destined for Olympic velodromes any more. The company\u2019s new Treadwell line, which starts at $US635 ($939), is targeted at those who use bikes for everything but setting course records and winning medals. With retro styling that\u2019s reminiscent of a \u201850s era Schwinn, the Treadwell EQ (the version we tested) looks unintimidating and approachable. It\u2019s designed for casual cyclists, and to that end Cannondale has included a bunch of practical features that make the EQ comfortable to ride and easy to maintain. It also caters to the app addicted generation with built-in sensors for stat tracking that even your parents could easily use to keep tabs on all the calories they burn.\n\nIt looks a little like the bike your dad grew up with, but the Treadwell EQ\u2019s design brings a lot of well thought out functionality to your ride. (Photo: Andrew Liszewski, Gizmodo)\n\nI have to admit that at first glance I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of the Treadwell\u2019s retro design, but after actually riding it for a few weeks, I\u2019ve come to realise the functionality of the design is the real appeal here, and more often than not I\u2019ve found myself choosing the Treadwell EQ over my Trek bike for everything but more demanding off-road rides.\n\nI\u2019ll also admit that I never saw myself as someone who\u2019d ride a bike with a basket on the front (an option included on the higher end EQ model) but a handful of runs to the grocery store proved it\u2019s an accessory that I\u2019m not sure I can live without now. It definitely beats trying to cram groceries into a backpack, and with enough bungee straps to keep everything secure, the basket essentially becomes your bike\u2019s trunk.\n\nPhoto: Andrew Liszewski, Gizmodo I never thought I\u2019d be the type of adult with a basket on their bike, but I\u2019m not sure I can live without one now. Photo: Andrew Liszewski, Gizmodo The cabling for the brakes and shifter are routed through the inside of the bike\u2019s frame so they\u2019re always out of the way. Photo: Andrew Liszewski, Gizmodo Oversized tires not only provide lots of grip, even in wet conditions, they also help to absorb bumps in the road for a surprisingly smooth ride.

Photo: Andrew Liszewski, Gizmodo The Treadwell EQ\u2019s bike saddle is the most comfortable bicycle seat I\u2019ve ever used. Photo: Andrew Liszewski, Gizmodo The use of skateboard grip tape instead of clips or serrated edges help keep regular shoes firmly perched on the Treadwell\u2019s pedals without scraping up their soles.\n\nThere are lots of subtle design choices on the Treadwell EQ that only make themselves known as you ride the bike, but soon become appreciated. The bike\u2019s \u201ccrooked\u201d cross bar makes it easier to throw your leg over. Cables for the disc brakes and gear shift are routed inside the bike\u2019s frame so they never catch on loose clothing or leave a grease smear. The tires are thicker than what you\u2019ll find on most road bikes, but provide lots of grip, even in the rain, and do a good job at absorbing bumps. Rubber strips along the crossbar allow you to lean it against a wall without damaging the paint finish. Instead of clips or serrated teeth, the EQ\u2019s pedals feature grip tape so regular shoes won\u2019t slip off. And the wide, padded saddle might be the most comfortable bike seat I\u2019ve ever used.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely a bike for the casual rider, but beginners probably won\u2019t be able to assemble it themselves. Unlike the bikes you\u2019ll find in a big box store, or even IKEA, you\u2019ll want to find a cycle shop to put the Treadwell together for you. Mine didn\u2019t include a printed assembly manual, and while I got some parts of the bike together on my own (screwing on the pedals was an easy step) others require special tools, like torque wrenches, so screws and bolts are properly tightened without damaging the frame. It cost me about $US50 ($74) to have my local bike shop assemble and safety check the Treadwell EQ for me, which is an extra expense I highly recommend.\n\nBut given who Cannondale is targeting with the Treadwell line, I was also surprised to find it didn\u2019t include a kickstand (most higher end bikes don\u2019t) and came with just basic reflectors. Tossing in a pair of LED safety lights and a kickstand would probably be very much appreciated by the type of rider who\u2019d be interested in the Treadwells: as I doubt they\u2019d realise ahead of time that neither would be included.\n\nThe Treadwell EQ includes a pre-installed sensor for tracking your rides, but you\u2019ll need to supply a mobile device. (Photo: Andrew Liszewski, Gizmodo)\n\nI found the lack of those basic accessories particularly confusing because Cannondale actually includes a wireless performance tracker\u2014created by Garmin\u2014built right into the Treadwell bikes. It\u2019s an accessory you can get for most higher-end bikes, but Cannondale has made the EQ\u2019s very easy to use as there\u2019s no installation or calibration required. But, I will point out that during my initial tests I had a lot of trouble getting the sensor to do anything at all, which was incredibly frustrating. Thankfully, after Cannondale released an update to the iOS version of its app I was using for testing, the stat tracking has been very straightforward and reliable.\n\nGif: Andrew Liszewski, Gizmodo The Cannondale app can serve as a dashboard for the Treadewell EQ, providing real time info on your speed, distance, and even how many calories you\u2019ve burned so far. The app also keeps track of past rides, letting you see the routes you\u2019ve ridden and your past performances, as well as keeping tabs on when you should be doing regular maintenance, or when it\u2019s time to take it into the cycle shop for a tuneup.\n\nOnce the front tire starts spinning, the Treadwell\u2019s sensor immediately starts recording performance data like your speed, distance ridden, and how long you\u2019ve been riding. Syncing it to the Cannondale app was painless, and after that, the Garmin sensor will automatically record your rides, and then sync it to your phone whenever it\u2019s in range again. It all works seamlessly with no intervention required, unlike other cycling apps that require you to manually start and stop stat-tracking for a ride. You don\u2019t necessarily have to even bring your smartphone with you, although the Cannondale app will take advantage of its GPS capabilities to also document the route you took.\n\nThe app isn\u2019t impressively robust; hardcore cyclists won\u2019t find any ways to do a deep dive on past rides compared to the most recent. But it provides more than enough details for casual riders, including how much fuel you\u2019d save over driving in a car. And I like that Cannondale uses the data from the sensor to let riders know when it\u2019s time for regular maintenance, like a tire or brake check.\n\nThe built-in SP Connect mount allows you to use your smartphone as the bike\u2019s digital dashboard, assuming you can get a compatible case for your device. (Photo: Andrew Liszewski, Gizmodo)\n\nCannondale has even included an SP Connect mount on the Treadwell EQ\u2019s handlebar stem so you can use your smartphone as a dashboard that displays real-time info about your speed and distance while riding. However, you\u2019ll have to cough up an extra $US30+ ($44)+ for a special SP connect smartphone case (it isn\u2019t included) and while one was available for my iPhone 8, my Google Pixel 2 XL wasn\u2019t supported. If it\u2019s a feature you think you\u2019d enjoy, there are lots of other smartphone bike mounting solutions out there.\n\nCannondale\u2019s Treadwell line is quite a bit of an investment. But the company has taken its expertise in designing bikes for competition and created a ride that\u2019s both accessible to any skill level, and functional for anything other than setting Olympic records\u2014although the easy performance tracking makes me hopeful my Olympic dreams aren\u2019t dashed yet.
