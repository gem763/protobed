Let\u2019s fundamentally boil it down, the Constitution is very clear that there has to be some pretty egregious behavior.\"\n\n\"Matt Whitaker\u2019s statement that \u2018abuse of power is not a crime\u2019 is the epitome of ignorance \u2013 ignorance of the Constitution, ignorance of the purposes and history of the Impeachment Clause, ignorance of America\u2019s history, ignorance of the law,\u201d Tribe said, according to Law & Crime.\n\n\u201cImpeachable offenses, which the Constitution quaintly calls \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors,\u2019 are offenses against the nation and its Constitution, not necessarily violations of criminal statutes.\u201d\n\nHARVARD PROFESSOR CRUDELY CALLS TRUMP A 'RACIST' WHO WANTS TO 'REVERSE OUTCOME OF THE CIVIL WAR'\n\nHis comments came as House Democrats pursue an impeachment inquiry regarding the president's July phone call with Ukraine. During that call, he requested the government investigate corruption concerns surrounding former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nTrump has claimed no wrongdoing but Democrats have suggested the phone call showed him trying to extort interference in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nTribe also claimed that some crimes weren't impeachable but some non-crimes were. \u201cLots of crimes, like tax evasion, aren\u2019t impeachable. And lots of impeachable offenses, like using the power of the presidency to usurp Congress\u2019s prerogatives, or shake down foreign allies by withholding congressionally appropriated military aid against their and our adversaries in order to enrich yourself or get reelected, aren\u2019t ordinary crimes at all, but surely are \u2018high Crimes\u2019 in the constitutional sense,\u201d he said.\n\nTribe clarified, however, that he thought the president committed a federal crime by \"soliciting foreign help in an American election.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe legal scholar has long been critical of Trump and claimed the president provided a \"slam dunk\" for the case against him when he released a rough transcript of his call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky", "description": "Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe had some strong words for former Attorney General Matthew Whitaker after he defended President Trump.", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
