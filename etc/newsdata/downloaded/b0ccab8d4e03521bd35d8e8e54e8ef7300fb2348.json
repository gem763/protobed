I\u2019ve listened to this chattering about hearsay and the whistleblower complaint for a week with increasing mystification about what it\u2019s supposed to prove.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to try the president of the United States on hearsay,\u201d @LindseyGrahamSC tells @margbrennan of impeaching @realDonaldTrump. pic.twitter.com/eZvLm7Myl9 \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) September 29, 2019\n\nHearsay isn\u2019t taboo at the investigation stage of a crime (or political crime, in the case of impeachment), nor should it be. Imagine if someone walked into the local police precinct and reported that he\u2019d overheard two co-workers plotting a murder. What should the cops do with that information? Ignore it on grounds that it\u2019s hearsay or chat with the informant to see if he seems credible and, if he does, investigate further?\n\nImagine that the police are stumped in trying to solve a murder and decide to launch a tip hotline in hopes that a member of the public knows something. Most of the tips that come in will go nowhere either because they\u2019re in earnest but based on mistaken information or because they\u2019re fabricated out-and-out. Some will involve hearsay. Should the police follow up on those leads anyway?\n\nWhat the whistleblower did in filing his complaint is nothing more or less than a tip. The \u201cpolice\u201d in this case are the inspector general (ICIG) who received the complaint and took a preliminary look to see if the tip seemed credible and House Democrats, who now have to try to flesh out the claims in the complaint with hard evidence and witness testimony. That\u2019s why subpoenas are suddenly flying for the likes of Mike Pompeo and Rudy Giuliani. Of course Senate Republicans aren\u2019t going to vote to remove Trump if all Democrats present to them is the bare allegations contained in the whistleblower complaint. That\u2019d be like trying to convict someone at a criminal trial with stuff that came in on the tip line. That\u2019s why we have a hearsay rule in the first place \u2014 because, at trial, when someone\u2019s liberty (or office, in the impeachment context) is on the line, we want the jury to make its decision based on reliable information. It would be a political gift to Republicans if House Democrats impeached Trump based on nothing more than hearsay; then the Senate GOP could quickly vote to acquit the president, laughing the whole way at how shoddy the Democrats\u2019 case is. Which would be appropriate, since the Senate is the \u201cjury\u201d in the impeachment process.\n\nBut before the jury phase? Let the cops run down every lead they have. Especially when a lead comes from someone whom they\u2019ve deemed credible.\n\nRelatedly, take a few minutes to read this statement issued by the ICIG tonight responding to a claim made by righties and echoed by Trump himself that the rules for whistleblowers were recently and suspiciously changed. Supposedly, until just last month, whistleblowers could only file a complaint based on firsthand information; the form for filing a complaint was allegedly changed in the nick of time to allow complaints based on secondhand information, a seemingly too-convenient switch that allowed the Ukraine whistleblower to get his claims about Trump sent up the chain of command.\n\nBut it\u2019s not true, says the ICIG.\n\nThe key point has to do with the statute. The law itself has never required firsthand information to file a complaint and the law is the only thing that matters. Again, analogize to a tip line: Why would the police ever insist that a tip be based on firsthand rather than secondhand information instead of simply welcoming all tips from the public and weighing the credibility of each individually? That\u2019s exactly what the ICIG did in conducting a preliminary investigation to see if the whistleblower/tipster seemed credible or not. Read his full statement and you\u2019ll see, as Gabe Malor explains, that the firsthand/secondhand distinction only matters in forming that initial conclusion about credibility. Firsthand information will be deemed *more* credible than secondhand but there\u2019s no legal requirement that the info in the complaint all be firsthand. (And some of it was firsthand, the ICIG notes.) The \u201ccop\u201d here looked at everything in assessing whether a tip deserved some follow-up. What else should he do?\n\nOn top of all that, there\u2019s an actual quasi-transcript of Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky that the president himself released. That\u2019s the key piece of evidence in the case against him; some Democrats will tell you that he can and should be impeached based on what\u2019s in that transcript even if there\u2019s no further evidence found supporting a quid pro quo involving Ukraine\u2019s military aid. The transcript also substantially corroborates some of the claims in the whistleblower complaint about what Trump allegedly said to Zelensky. In which case: What the hell is Graham doing prattling on about hearsay? He should worry less about that and more about his buddy\u2019s own admission against interest in the form of that transcript.\n\nOne more point about hearsay. If you happen to know a lawyer, ask him or her whether there are any exceptions to the hearsay rule at trial. They\u2019ll probably look at you funny and sigh wearily before launching into their explanation. That\u2019s because there are lots of exceptions \u2014 lots-lots \u2014 and a good chunk of law-school classes on evidence is devoted to them. That is, even if some hearsay evidence is offered to the Senate, there\u2019s a reasonably good chance that it\u2019ll be admissible anyway. Graham is a well-trained lawyer and knows that, of course, but he\u2019s also a BS artist spinning desperately for his friend here and hoping to confuse viewers. If he repeats \u201cit\u2019s hearsay!\u201d often enough, maybe Republican viewers will start repeating it too and using it as an excuse not to pay attention to the Ukraine matter any further. It\u2019s hearsay!
