Two others aged around nine months old were discovered later.\n\nThe group said it was \"horrified\" by the \"apparent act of cruelty\", with the three surviving joeys now requiring round-the-clock care.\n\nEastern grey kangaroos usually begin venturing out of their mother's pouch at about nine months of age, but are not fully independent until they reach 18 months.", "description": "An Australian teenager has been charged over the deaths of 20 kangaroos, which he allegedly mowed down with his truck in a killing spree that lasted an hour.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3711/668587352c5c4b10ad63534e05fb0206.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
