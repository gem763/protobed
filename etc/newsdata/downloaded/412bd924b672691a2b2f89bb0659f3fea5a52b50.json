Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit Deal On Knife Edge as EU Needs More Time\n\n(Bloomberg) -- U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal was hanging in the balance Monday, after European Union Presidency said more time was needed before a summit of its leaders this week.\n\nAntti Rinne, premier of Finland -- which currently has the rotating presidency of the EU -- said negotiations may need to continue after the EU Council summit that starts Thursday.\n\n\u201cI think there is no time in a practical way and in a legal base to reach an agreement before the Council meeting, I think we need to have more time,\u201d Rinne told reporters in Helsinki.\n\nWith 17 days before the U.K. is due to leave the EU, Johnson repeatedly pledged to \u201cget Brexit done,\u201d as he spoke in Parliament on Monday following a Queen\u2019s Speech that laid the ground for a general election. He\u2019s refused to ask for a delay to Brexit, even though the Benn Act says he must do so if he hasn\u2019t finalized a deal with both the EU and U.K. Parliament by Oct. 19.\n\nThe EU plans to decide Wednesday whether there will be a deal for leaders to sign during the Oct. 17-18 summit and has ruled out negotiating during the actual meeting of leaders.\n\nJohnson postponed a meeting of his political cabinet to Wednesday, when it may become clearer whether a Brexit deal will be done this week, and the government will then be able to decide whether to call MPs in for a sitting on Saturday.\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid also announced Nov. 6 as the date for his annual Budget, but that will only take place if the government gets a Brexit deal.\n\nPound Shaken Up by Positioning in Fear of Swift and Brutal Move\n\nWith the clock ticking down, Johnson\u2019s Brexit opponents in the U.K. met Monday to discuss their next move. They concluded any deal Johnson brings back would probably be incomplete, meaning he\u2019d likely have to delay Brexit anyway, according to two people familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe group, which consists of some Labour MPs, the Liberal Democrats, Wales\u2019 Plaid Cymru, the Scottish National Party and Greens \u2014 alongside some former Conservatives \u2014 said they\u2019d wait and see how the next 48 hours pans out.\n\nIf Johnson gets a deal they would then decide whether to seek a confirmatory public vote on it as a price for allowing it to pass Parliament, the people said.\n\nBut Johnson once again ruled out another referendum on Brexit on Monday.\n\n\u201cIf there could be one thing more divisive more toxic than the first referendum, it would be a second referendum,\u201d he said.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit Deal On Knife Edge as EU Needs More Time", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC6H0BP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
