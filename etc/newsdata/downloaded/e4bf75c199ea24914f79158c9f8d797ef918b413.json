Sondland\u2019s path to the diplomatic post is rather odd: He\u2019s a wealthy former hotel and finance magnate turned political donor turned globetrotting diplomat.\n\nBut even more mysterious is his involvement in the affairs of Ukraine, a non-EU country, where he\u2019s made at least three separate visits in recent months. It\u2019s a mystery that House investigators are trying to solve, but they won't be able to ask Sondland about it: On Tuesday, hours before he was due to answer questions in a closed-door hearing, the Trump administration told him not to testify.\n\n\"Early this morning, the U.S. Department of State directed Ambassador Gordon Sondland not to appear today for his scheduled transcribed interview,\" Sondland's attorney said in a statement. \"Ambassador Sondland is profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify today.\"\n\nSondland has quickly emerged as a key figure in the House\u2019s ongoing impeachment investigation. He was mentioned in the complaint of the anonymous intelligence-community whistleblower, who said Sondland helped \u201c\u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the president had made of\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nAnd last Thursday, Kurt Volker, former U.S. acting ambassador to Ukraine, provided House investigators text messages that show Sondland acted as a conduit for Trump with Ukraine\u2019s new government, helping set up the July 25 call in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n\n\n\"We know Ambassador Sondland was a key player in efforts to obtain the commitment from Ukraine to investigate a bogus conspiracy theory about the 2016 election as well as Joe Biden and his son,\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said Tuesday morning.\n\nDone with Trump ...\n\nSondland is the son of German Jews who escaped the Holocaust and eventually settled in the Pacific Northwest. He\u2019s a diehard conservative who once gifted his wife a signed copy of Ayn Rand\u2019s \"Atlas Shrugged.\"\n\nHe made a fortune in the hotel industry and has been a major GOP donor for decades. But the extent of his actual governmental experience had been limited to work on an Oregon state board that sought to bring television and movie production to the state, plus a spot on the ceremonial Commission on White House Fellows during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\nHe backed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the 2016 GOP primary, donating more than $20,000 to a pro-Bush superPAC. He came around once Trump was the de facto nominee, with plans to chair a fundraiser. But then he pulled out when Trump attacked the family of Humayun Khan, a Muslim-American soldier who\u2019d died in the line of duty.\n\nA Sondland spokeswoman said at the time that Sondland and his business partner, Bashar Wali, were done with Trump.\n\n\u201cMr. Sondland is a first-generation American whose parents were forced to flee Germany during the years leading up to World War II because they were persecuted for their faith, and Mr. Wali is a Muslim-American who emigrated to this country from Syria,\u201d Provenance Hotels spokeswoman Kate Buska told Willamette Week. \u201cIn light of Mr. Trump's treatment of the Khan family and the fact his constantly evolving positions diverge from their personal beliefs and values on so many levels, neither Mr. Sondland or Mr. Wali can support his candidacy.\u201d\n\n... only, not really\n\nBut for Sondland, those values were apparently malleable. After Trump\u2019s victory, Sondland gave a combined $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee through four limited liability corporations, as first reported by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThat put him back in the president\u2019s good graces. Early last year, Trump nominated him to be EU ambassador.\n\nSondland has talked up how close he is to the president. During that Ukrainian TV interview, he said he\u2019d talked to Trump before sitting down with Ukraine\u2019s president. But he may end up regretting his newfound role in Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nSondland would certainly have been asked about that interview, which came the day after Trump\u2019s now-famous call with Ukraine\u2019s president. \u201cWe want to make sure that all of the reforms are on track,\u201d he said, an apparent reference to Trump\u2019s push to get Ukraine to investigate debunked theories that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election \u2014 and perhaps Biden.\n\nInvestigators surely also have questions about Sondland\u2019s text messages, which reveal his efforts to help Trump secure the Ukraine government\u2019s cooperation. The president has publicly called for Ukraine to investigate Biden after doing so during his call with Zelensky in late July.\n\n\u201cI think POTUS really wants the deliverable,\u201d Sondland texted Volker on Aug. 9. In the same conversation, he suggested asking to see a draft statement on what Ukraine\u2019s president would say to ensure it matched what Trump was pushing for \u2014 an investigation into who was behind 2016.\n\nActing U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor texted Sondland on September 9 saying \u201cit's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d Sondland fired back hours later, insisting that \u201cno quid pro quo's of any kind\u201d were promised \u2014 before asking Taylor to stop texting about the issue.\n\nA special assignment\n\nFormer diplomats told VICE News that Sondland\u2019s \u201cspecial assignment\u201d was unusual.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s out of the ordinary to have another ambassador intervening in a random country,\u201d said Gordon Giffin, who served as U.S. ambassador to Canada under President Clinton.\n\nTwo previous U.S. ambassadors to the E.U. said issues related to Ukraine did come up at times in the course of their diplomatic work. But both told VICE News they never visited the country during their assignment.\n\nBoyden Gray served as U.S. ambassador to the EU under President George W. Bush. He told VICE News that Ukrainian energy independence issues had long been part of discussions for EU ambassadors, and said \u201cit\u2019s hard to see [Sondland] not getting involved\u201d in some form with Ukraine.\n\nTony Gardner, who served in the same capacity under President Obama, said he\u2019d worked on Ukraine-related issues as well, helping coordinate U.S.-EU sanctions against Russia in response to their invasion of Crimea in 2014. But he said he \u201cnever traveled to Kiev\u201d while he was in office.\n\nSondland didn\u2019t respond to a phone call requesting comment. Buska and Wali also didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Nor did the White House.\n\nSondland sailed through his Senate confirmation process with bipartisan support. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) even vouched for his fellow Oregonian during the confirmation hearing. He\u2019d known \u201cGordy\u201d and his family for a quarter-century in Oregon\u2019s small Jewish community, he said, and praised him for his philanthropic efforts in their state while promising he\u2019d be \u201ca really good fit\u201d for the ambassadorship.\n\nBut in light of recent events, Wyden had a warning for his old friend.\n\n\u201cMr. Sondland, and any official who has knowledge of Trump's schemes to get foreign leaders to interfere in our elections, must fully cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee and the Inspector General,\u201d Wyden said in a statement to VICE News. \u201cDonald Trump has a long history of throwing his associates under the bus to protect his own skin, and I expect that any Trump official banking on this administration to protect them ought to think seriously about the prospect of major disappointment.\u201d\n\nCover: Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, second from right, with President Trump.
