He said: \"I've never openly gone out there in the public eye and dated a guy. I've always been very private.\n\n\"So this is a big, huge step for me.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nTwitter users were shocked at Duncan's decision not to see Joao again, as they appeared to get along so well during their date.\n\n\"I thought Duncan & the other guy seemed well matched\", said one.\n\n\"I\u2019m shocked at Duncan\u2019s reaction\" said another.\n\n\"Can't believe Duncan wouldn't date him\" said a third.\n\nA fourth branded him \"picky\".\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nHis date may not have been a success, but since filming the show, Duncan has found love.\n\nHe is now dating Brazilian-Belgiun model Rodrigo Reis.\n\nHe told Lorraine Kelly that his boyfriend is preparing to meet his 14-year-old daughter, who he shares with former ballet dancer Claire Grainger.\n\nMeanwhile Ulrika Jonsson, 51, had a great time with Bristolian Paul, and the two agreed to meet again.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nTwitter lusted after silver fox Paul.\n\n\"Corrr this guy on #firstdateshotel Paul is gorgeous and from Bristol too.
