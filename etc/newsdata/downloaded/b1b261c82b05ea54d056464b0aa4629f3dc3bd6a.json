Schwimmer said Hong Kong may not have a \u201ccompetitive position\u201d in the future, and that he sees China\u2019s financial hub as Shanghai, where the LSE has a built a hard-won listing link. The LSE has also pointed to Hong Kong\u2019s political unrest as undermining HKEX\u2019s business.\n\nLi disputed this vision of a future where his city gets eclipsed, disagreeing with Schwimmer on the matter of Chinese capital controls, which don\u2019t apply to Hong Kong -- helping preserve the territory\u2019s advantage as a conduit of investment. While Schwimmer said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that China would lift the controls, Li bets that nothing will change -- and \u201cwe will continue talking about it for 20 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is afraid of uncontrolled massive migration of funding back and forth,\u201d Li said. In the meantime, Hong Kong and the U.K. share a language and English common law, making the two markets the most natural bridge between China and the U.S., he said.\n\nGovernment Links\n\nLi also addressed a major irritant for the LSE -- HKEX\u2019s governance structure. Hong Kong\u2019s government holds 6% of HKEX\u2019s stock, appoints 6 of the 13 board members, and the city\u2019s chief executive -- a person appointed by Beijing -- picks HKEX\u2019s chairman. LSE has suggested U.S. and U.K. regulators could thus block the bid on national-security grounds.\n\n\u201cIf the transaction proceeds, we are open to changing our governance structure,\u201d Li said.\n\nSo far, most investors have preferred that the LSE continue with its $27 billion plan to buy Refinitiv to expand in data -- a deal HKEX wants to block. HKEX is trying to counter this with a charm offensive, hiring UBS Group AG to convince shareholders of the merits of its own proposal, people familiar with the matter said in recent days.\n\nIt was \u201cnow or never,\u201d Li said on Tuesday. \u201cWe know the odds are low, and the other side is engaged -- not exactly the best time to make a proposal. But our conviction is so deep, and so profound, that we have to take some risk and take some loss of face because the other side will reject us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I was in David\u2019s shoes, I would reject Charles Li,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the nature of things. I accept that.\u201d\n\nLi said his deal wasn\u2019t about slashing costs.\n\nFor all the other [proposed exchange takeovers] the opportunity wasn\u2019t incrementally increasing. M&A was driven by cost synergies, which is firing people. It\u2019s easy to say get rid of the people, but harder to say whether, when you get rid of the people, whether the opportunity they are working on will get lost as well.\n\nLi on how his bidding plan was disrupted by Brexit delays:\n\nI regret to say we were late. We have wanted to do this for quite a while, but we thought we could wait a bit more. We thought Brexit would create uncertainties that we could live without. Waiting for March 31, and then October ... and then events overtook it.\n\nLi on the future of Brexit London with a HKEX deal:\n\nThis great city became a global financial center 34 years ago because you became the dollar center outside of the U.S. The value proposition that the U.K. presents to America is going to be so much more. U.K. and America are so connected already. Being able to connect with Asia in such a manner: just imagine the U.K.\u2019s bargaining power on that global scale.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Viren Vaghela in London at vvaghela1@bloomberg.net;Benjamin Robertson in London at brobertson29@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ambereen Choudhury at achoudhury@bloomberg.net, Keith Campbell, Marion Dakers\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The man who runs Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange fleshed out his vision for combining with its London counterpart, saying the marriage could funnel Chinese cash to the U.K. capital and make it the world\u2019s dominant financial center long after Brexit.\u201cIn 20 years, together, this city is going", "authors": ["Viren Vaghela", "Benjamin Robertson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
