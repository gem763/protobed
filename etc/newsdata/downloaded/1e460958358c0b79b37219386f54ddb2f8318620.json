But in late summer, this throbbing mass of 19.98 million residents buzzes even more than usual, and there\u2019s a palpable excitement in the air for one of the year\u2019s most anticipated festivals: Ganesh Chaturthi.\n\nThis massive event, which is held in late August or early September (starting on 2 September in 2019), honours the birth of Lord Ganesha, the beloved elephant-headed Hindu god who is believed to remove obstacles and bring good fortune and wisdom. The 10- to 15-day festival is both sacred and celebratory. Residents fast, recite Vedic hymns and place richly decorated clay idols of Lord Ganesha in their homes, but also swarm the streets in boisterous parades and to dance to thumping music.\n\nThe festival is now celebrated by millions of people both elsewhere in India and in Hindu communities around the world \u2013 but nowhere is it bigger than in Mumbai.", "description": "Once used to unite Indians against British rule, this spectacular 10-day party sees millions of people around the world take to the streets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7l/vh/p07lvhpv.jpg"}
