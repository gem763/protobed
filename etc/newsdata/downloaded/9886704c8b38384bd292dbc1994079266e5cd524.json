The lower the rate the higher the compensation paid.\n\nIn August, the rate was changed from -0.75 per cent to -0.25 per cent. Whilst this might seem like a modest change, any movement of the Ogden rate has a significant impact on insurance.\n\nThe new -0.25 per cent rate equates to higher than anticipated compensation payouts for accident victims.\n\nAdding to the issue, many insurers had already priced in a 0 per cent to 1 per cent move.\n\nHowever, some insurers have actually benefited from the Ogden change as they've based their pricing on the old -0.75 per cent rate meaning they could be in a position to offer premium reductions going forward.\n\nJohn Blevins, pricing expert at Consumer Intelligence, said: 'Pricing at an overall level will be driven by claims experience and the impact of the Ogden discount rate.\n\n'Many insurers feel misled by the government and had planned for a more favourable discount rate being set. As such, premiums are being adjusted to compensate for the cash injections on to claims reserves made by many insurers.'\n\nCOST OF CAR INSURANCE PREMIUMS ACROSS THE UK Region Price change seen over the\n\nlast 12 months\n\n(Sep 2018 Sep 2019) Price Index for the last 3 months\n\n(June 2019 Sep 2019) August 2019\n\nAverage Premium\n\n(5 cheapest) West Midlands 4.60% 1.30% \u00a3903 London 3.60% 1.60% \u00a31,171 Scotland 3.30% 0.00% \u00a3602 North East 2.30% 0.10% \u00a3693 Wales 2.20% 1.10% \u00a3593 East Midlands 2.00% 1.10% \u00a3757 South East 1.90% 0.30% \u00a3640 North West 1.60% 0.90% \u00a3880 Eastern 1.30% 0.40% \u00a3647 Yorks & The Humber -0.40% 0.60% \u00a3847 South West -0.60% 0.20% \u00a3516 Source: Consumer Intelligence\n\nRegional\n\nConsumer Intelligence also analysed which regions of the UK are paying the most for their insurance - and where has had the steepest increases.\n\nIt found that Londoners are paying the highest premiums in the country at an average of \u00a31,171 per year.\n\nThe capital has also seen an increase of 3.6 per cent over the past year \u2013 making it one of the areas that has seen the biggest increase in the UK.\n\nMotorists in the West Midlands, however, have seen the biggest increase in the last 12 months at 4.6 per cent \u2013 paying an average of \u00a3903.\n\nThose in Scotland have saw the third biggest increases of 3.3 per cent, leaving drivers paying \u00a3602 a year.\n\nMeanwhile, the cheapest place to insure a car was found to be in the South West of England where average premiums are \u00a3516 \u2013 with prices dropping 0.6 per cent in the past year \u2013 making it the cheapest place for the second year in a row.\n\nYorkshire and Humber was the only other location to record premium falls in the last year, dropping prices by 0.4 per cent. However, this still leaves motorists to pay \u00a3847 a year on average.\n\nTelematics\n\nBlack box car insurance, also known as telematics, is one of the main reasons for keeping prices in check for younger drivers but the take up is slow for the older generations.\n\nConsumer Intelligence found that around 64 per cent of the top five cheapest quotes for under 25's are now provided by telematics providers.\n\nHowever, this drops to 12 per cent for drivers aged 25 to 50 and to just three per cent for those over 50.\n\nThe telematics industry has still come a long way in a short time as they currently provide nearly one in five of the cheapest car insurance quotes on the market.\n\nThis is double the amount of coverage they had six years ago when Consumer Intelligence began collecting data.", "description": "Premiums for the 25 to 49 year old age group have risen by 3 per cent  to \u00a3699 in the past year and by 3.6 per cent for the over 50's to \u00a3407, according to research from Consumer Intelligence.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
