Italy's Moncler is meanwhile studying expanding the size of its stores in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.\n\n\"The whole economy is slowing down and salary growth is also slowing. So consumers who originally bought when they traveled will now buy domestically,\" said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING.\n\nShe added a cut to sales taxes this year which prompted some luxury brands to lower their prices in China could also be an attraction.\n\nHONG KONG PROTESTS\n\nThe strength in China has helped insulate luxury companies from a major financial hit from months of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong that have forced them to temporarily close shops and which have kept tourists away.\n\nKering's Gucci fashion label, for example, said it has managed to make up for lost business in the former British colony due to spending shifting back to mainland China.\n\nThe turmoil is far from over, however, with protests in Hong Kong descending into clashes between demonstrators and police this week.\n\nIn the United States, meanwhile, Tiffany boss Alessandro Bogliolo told Reuters this month the company was pursuing Chinese buyers who were staying at home, saying it needed to \"follow customers where they shop\".\n\nHe has sent high-end jewelry including diamond necklaces costing $1 million or more to its stores in mainland China from New York.\n\nThe demand for luxury in China may even be aiding more mass-market players like personal care products maker Procter & Gamble Co, which raised its global sales forecasts on the back of premium beauty brands such as China Olay.\n\nEmma Zhang, a 32-year-old investment analyst in Shanghai, said she was indulging more in what she said were little luxuries.\n\n\"I used to be the type to buy many cheap items, and would change them frequently,\" she said. \"My shopping habits have changed and I've been buying things that are better quality.\"", "description": "What slowdown?
