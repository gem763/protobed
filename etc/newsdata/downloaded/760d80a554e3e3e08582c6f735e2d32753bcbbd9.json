Trump\u2019s bumbling retreat from alliances, from responsibility and from basic sanity has sown discord in Europe and has created new playgrounds for Russian meddling. It has also left a vacuum of influence in the Pacific that is being filled by China. The damage to U.S. interests is considerable and growing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe cost of betraying a friend in battle \u2014 particularly to appease an authoritarian thug \u2014 is clear. It makes every friend and ally less likely to trust the United States. But what gets less attention is the cost of betraying American principles, particularly on human dignity. When Trump leaves the Kurds to ethnic cleansing, or is dismissive of the rights of protesters in Hong Kong, he is not only dishonoring national principles. He is forfeiting a decisive American advantage.\n\nThe world, no doubt, is complex and fallen, and often requires ambiguous choices. And there are limits to the influence of any single nation. But American ideology \u2014 a belief that the rights of life and liberty are universal endowments \u2014 is not an altruistic add-on to its \u201creal\u201d interests. It is an instrument by which those interests are realized.\n\nIt mattered greatly to the outcome of the Cold War that the aspirations of the average Czech or Polish citizen \u2014 for freedom, self-government and a life of simple dignity \u2014 were opposed by the Soviet Union and supported by the United States. In a very real way, U.S. interests were achieved only when Czech and Polish aspirations were fully honored. Disregarding or discounting human rights would not only have violated the principles that led the United States into the world; it would have squandered a serious strategic advantage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe same is true today concerning American competition with China in Africa. Chinese aims have little moral content. The Chinese government seeks resources and influence by cooperating with oppressive governments, buying off elites and encouraging African debt. As a matter of policy (and hopefully a matter of practice), the United States, in contrast, encourages health, human development, self-government and access to global markets. Chinese goals are often achieved at the expense of average Africans; American goals are achieved by their flourishing. We will see, in the long run, which approach is wiser.\n\nTrump\u2019s conception of \u201cAmerica First\u201d not only serves Chinese and Russian interests; it is an attempt to reshape U.S. foreign policy on a Chinese or Russian model \u2014 devaluing democratic universalism in favor of raw nationalism.\n\nThis presents a practical problem. Since World War II, the United States has been a very different kind of hegemon. We committed American resources, and the lives of American military forces, to a rules-based international order in which other free countries could thrive, rather than a zero-sum struggle of great powers. Bluntly put: A Pacific dominated by Japan was a nightmare for the rest of Asia. A Pacific patrolled by U.S. ships is good for the rest of Asia. The Warsaw Pact succeeded by intimidation and repression; NATO succeeded by partnership.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd because the United States exercised power without conquest, and sought wealth without exploitation, it helped forestall a concerted challenge to its preeminence. If \u201cAmerica First\u201d means the reduction of U.S. influence to the raw pursuit of its own power and wealth, it will invite question and challenge.\n\nThese are the real stakes of the debate on human rights. If the lives of Kurds and Chinese really mean nothing to the United States, then American ideology is a sham, and U.S. influence is correspondingly less justified. Trump\u2019s amoral foreign policy is a source of shame \u2014 and a source of danger.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The president\u2019s amoral foreign policy brings shame to the U.S.", "authors": ["Michael Gerson"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/N-tFSi_hH1-MulY50DW-10tKpXM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZII5QOXRDMI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
