I was having a really good Thursday morning until I found out adored Netflix series Grace and Frankie is coming to an end. I am devastated. The wholesome series, about two rivals turned best friends, will end after seven seasons making it the longest-running series in Netflix history.\n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t be devo as seven seasons is A LOT compared to other shows on the streaming giant. But alas, I am still devo.\n\nJane Fonda and Lily Tomlin star in the titular roles, as Grace and Frankie, who are given one heck of a shock when their longtime husbands Robert (Martin Sheen) and Sol (Sam Waterston) come out over dinner and announce they\u2019re leaving them for each other.\n\nBaron Vaughn, Brooklyn Decker, June Diane Raphael, and Ethan Embry co-star as the kids.\n\nOh God, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s really true. It\u2019s ending.\n\nYou have laughed with us, cried with us and grew old with us. Today we announce Grace & Frankie has been renewed for what will be our seventh and final season. \u2014 Grace and Frankie (@GraceandFrankie) September 4, 2019\n\nIn a joint statement Fonda and Tomlin said they are \u201cboth delighted and heartbroken that Grace and Frankie will be back for its seventh, though final season.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re so grateful that our show has been able to deal with issues that have really connected to our grand generation. And their kids, and amazingly, their kids as well. We\u2019ll miss these two old gals, Grace and Frankie, as much as many of their fans will, but we\u2019ll still be around. We\u2019ve outlasted so many things \u2013 just hope we don\u2019t outlast the planet.\n\nNetflix has ordered 16 episodes for season 7, bringing its overall episode tally to an almighty 94.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s thrilling and somehow fitting, that our show about the challenges, as well as the beauty and dignity of aging, will be the oldest show on Netflix,\u201d said series co-creators and showrunners Marta Kauffman and Howard J. Morris.\n\nOn the bright side, season 6 hasn\u2019t even premiered yet. It\u2019s set to hit Netflix come January 2020 so there\u2019s still plenty of time to emotionally prepare yourself for the end.\n\nSEASON 5 SPOILERS:\n\nAt the very end of the fifth season \u2013 like literally the final seconds \u2013 Grace tells Frankie she spontaneously married Nick (Peter Gallagher) and Frankie freaks the fuck out. So I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s where season 6 is going to pick up from.", "description": "Grace and Frankie, about two rivals turned best friends, will end after seven seasons making it the longest running series in Netflix history.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Grace-Frankie.png"}
