Where I spent my childhood summer holidays. Now we stay in Sennen Cove. Sennen beach is just the most beautiful one I've ever visited.\n\n\n\nWHO IS YOUR IDEAL TRAVEL COMPANION?\n\n\n\nMy husband Mark. We love the same places - Cornwall, Barcelona and New York.\n\n\n\nYOUR MOST MEMORABLE TRAVEL DESTINATION?\n\n\n\nLos Angeles. We hired a house in the Hollywood Hills, which was once owned by Orson Welles. I loved the food, the people, the energy, everything about it.\n\n\n\nTHE THREE BEST THINGS TO DO THERE?\n\n\n\nThe Universal Studios Tour. The ArcLight cinema on Sunset Boulevard where movie goers can dine before or during a film. The beaches are a must: Paradise Cove is gorgeous and we loved Santa Monica.\n\n\n\nWITH MONEY NO OBJECT, WHERE IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU HAVE DINNER?\n\n\n\nThe hotel Il San Pietro di Positano in Positano, Italy. Jamie Oliver spent his honeymoon there. It's built into the cliffs and has a huge veranda with the best views of the Amalfi coast.\n\n\n\nItalian idyll: Nadia would love to try the food at the hotel Il San Pietro di Positano\n\nWHAT IS THE STRANGEST DISH YOU'VE EATEN ON YOUR TRAVELS?\n\n\n\nBaked lamb's tongue in Morocco. I had to slice bits off it and dip it in cumin and salt. It was slimy, gristly and not very nice.\n\n\n\nWHAT DO YOU NEVER TRAVEL WITHOUT?\n\n\n\nMy hair-removing cream for my moustache and a homeopathic kit.\n\n\n\nRECOMMEND A HOLIDAY READ?\n\n\n\nThe thriller Hangover Square by Patrick Hamilton.\n\n\n\nWHERE TO NEXT?\n\n\n\nI want to experience the vibrancy of India.\n\n", "description": "The TV presenter and winner of Celebrity Masterchef has certainly tried some unusual foods on holiday, but still hasn't made it to Il San Pietro di Positano, in Italy.", "authors": ["Anthi Charalambous"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/24/article-2545479-1AEE946900000578-411_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2014-01-24"}
