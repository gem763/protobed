Anti-Brexiters say that negotiations over a future relationship during this transition will end in No Deal 2.0, because the UK wants to become more ambitious in terms of deregulation and tax cuts \u2014 making it more attractive to foreign investors and businesses \u2014 while the EU wants to continue imposing Brussels\u2019 regulatory standards on the UK to maintain its anti-competitive \u2018level playing field\u2019.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Westminster Hour on Sunday night, Mr Blair said: \u201cThe truth is No Deal is still on the table because the negotiations are actually a tale of two deals. The second deal, which is the really important one, Britain\u2019s future relationship with Europe, is not decided yet. It will be a negotiation after we do Brexit. It\u2019s got to be dealt with by the end of 2020, and the fact of the matter is I actually think the likely outcome of that is No Deal.\u201d\n\nPM Johnson Woos U.S. Investment with Post-Brexit Lower Taxes, Regulation Cuts https://t.co/0HSC8gPSCq \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 24, 2019\n\nThe neo-liberal former prime minister continued: \u201cEurope is now on notice from Britain and its ministers that Britain wants Brexit to compete around tax and regulation, to become an off-shore competitor with the European Union.\n\n\u201cWhat is absolutely clear is that Europe is not going to have that. They\u2019re going to say to the UK side \u2014 this is why this negotiation is going to be very ugly and very difficult \u2014 they\u2019re going to say, \u2018No, we\u2019re not giving you tariff-free access to our markets if you\u2019re going to start using a whole lot of competitive tax and regulatory measures in order to undercut us\u2019.\u201d\n\nOther EU leaders have expressed concern in the past that a competitive post-Brexit Britain could threaten their precious regional monopoly. This month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed concern that the UK could become a \u201cpotential competitor\u201d on the level of the United States or China.\n\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will table a motion to call for a snap election. However, it is not expected to pass as the measure requires a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons and Labour remains opposed to it.\n\nMr Blair continued in his interview on Westminster Hour that Labour should only back a December general election \u201cso that we rule out No Deal as the future outcome of the negotiation because otherwise, Jeremy Corbyn hasn\u2019t prevented No Deal\u201d.\n\nThe globalist former prime minister also said that under such conditions a general election and second Brexit referendum could happen on the same day.\n\n\u201cYou can deal with them both on the same day if you want. But you should deal with them separately,\u201d he said.\n\nConservative Brexiteer Mark Francois told The Sun in response to the former Labour leader\u2019s suggestion: \u201cThe latest offering from that great seeker after truth himself Tony Blair to combine a second referendum and a general election on the same day is patently ludicrous.\u201d", "description": "Former Prime Minister Tony Blair is concerned that the next round of negotiations with the EU will end in a 'no deal'.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1173874293-e1572272211627-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
