In August, Tokyo removed Seoul from a list of trusted trade partners with preferential status, while South Korea withdrew from a regional military intelligence-sharing agreement that includes Japan.\n\nA Japanese official involved in the matter said members of Japan\u2019s Fair Trade Commission, which will review the merger application, believe the tie-up would make it more difficult for local yards to compete.\n\n\u201cThere is no foregone conclusion, but some regulators feel it\u2019s too big of a market share,\u201d the official said. \u201cThere is a lot of skepticism on this.\u201d\n\nJapanese regulators do not comment on requests before reaching a conclusion.\n\nShipbuilding is recovering from a maritime-sector downturn that sent new orders plummeting as operators in the container, tanker and dry-bulk vessel sectors scaled down their fleets.\n\nThe business is a vital part of the economies in Asian countries such as South Korea and China, employing hundreds of thousands of people. Seoul and Beijing have repeatedly bailed out or subsidized yards that have suffered steep financial losses over a multiyear shipping slump.\n\nChinese state-owned operations are undertaking their own consolidation, and Hyundai Heavy agreed in June to buy DSME in a $1.6 billion deal with Korea Development Bank, DSME\u2019s controlling shareholder.\n\n\u201cThe merger is for survival,\u201d HHI Chief Executive Ka Sam-Hyun said. \u201cKorean yards have stayed alive for too long on state support and nobody wants more bailouts.\u201d\n\nJapan is the world\u2019s third-largest shipbuilding country after China and South Korea. Its yards are at the forefront of designing a new generation of vessels that would run on batteries or biofuels as the shipping industry moves to comply with stricter pollution regulations.\n\n\u201cThere is still opposition from within the yards with workers fearing job losses and benefit cuts, but the main hurdle is regulatory approvals from abroad and especially from Japan. If they say no, it could all come crumbling down,\u201d a senior Korean maritime executive said.\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "description": "South Korean officials are concerned that Seoul\u2019s increasingly strained trade relations with Japan could derail the country\u2019s planned megamerger of the country\u2019s two big shipbuilders.", "authors": ["Costas Paris", "Costas.Paris Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104220/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
