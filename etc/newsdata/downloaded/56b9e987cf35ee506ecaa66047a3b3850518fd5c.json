With U.S. unemployment near a 50-year-low, qualified workers are in short supply, while major companies and a number of states around the country are hiking their minimum wage. For small businesses, that puts a premium on getting their payroll processes right.\n\nEspecially crucial for employers: properly classifying workers as full employees or as independent contractors. Mistakes can mean running afoul of labor laws and paying more in payroll taxes to the IRS. Given the thin margins for many small businesses, it's no exaggeration to say that such errors can be fatal.\n\nEmployers can consult IRS checklists to determine whether workers are contractors or employees, but the central question comes down to how much control they have over a person's work. For example, a painter, may be employed for a short-term project, but supply their own tools and determine the project timeline.\n\n\"A rule of thumb is that if you're controlling the person's place of work, how they work, when they work -- typically, they're going to be an employee,\" small business consultant David Ragland, CEO of IRC Wealth Strategies, told CBSN.\n\nFor contractors, \"independence\" means they get more flexibility in terms of doing the job. They can also deduct expenses from their income, lowering their tax liability.\n\nA key decision\n\nThe bottom line, Ragland notes, is that doing payroll right can be complex and time-consuming. For business owners, a first step in ensuring that financial records are accurate is to figure out when they need a bookkeeper and when they would benefit by using an accountant (many employers will need both!).\n\nA bookkeeper can take all of the financial records the business has stockpiled \u2014 from business receipts to reported tips \u2014 and organize the information to produce financial statements, pay bills or create invoices. Bookkeepers can also automate a part of the payroll structure by outsourcing the process to companies like ADP, Paychex, Paycom or QuickBooks. Meanwhile, an accountant can help certify all the records are correct when filing tax returns.", "description": "Setting up a proper payroll system can spell the difference between success and failure for small business owners", "authors": ["Sarah Min"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/11/e445dd9d-0f1c-4bef-b7d1-9cad30e81c12/thumbnail/1200x630/cd713189238080a807127a78e1013c8d/gettyimages-945398668-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-11"}
