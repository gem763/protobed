Tonight we had an amazing encounter with an incredible young man named Juan. He came up to Cameron and asked is he could pray over him and his protection. After crying my eyes out we got to have an amazing conversation with this gentleman. He was on FIRE for God and you could feel His presence in the room. He said that he had felt compelled to talk to us and to pray over Cameron.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, O\u2019Neal, 21, senior at Stetson University, pulled up to Zaxby's restaurant in Deland and felt compelled to park next to a police squad car.\n\n\u201cBefore he was a detective, my father was a deputy who did undercover work with a gang task force,\u201d O\u2019Neal, president of his school\u2019s Fellowship of Christian Athletes, tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\n\n\nTucker, his wife, and their 2-year-old son, were inside the restaurant. While ordering food, O\u2019Neal struck up a conversation, asking Tucker questions about his son and his \u201cWoody\u201d figurine from the film Toy Story.\n\nAfter both men picked up their food and were seated at their respective tables, O\u2019Neal had a striking thought.\n\n\u201cI felt the Lord was [telling me] to pray for this man,\u201d he tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cI know how much police officers go through and prayer changes things.\u201d\n\nOfficer Tucker was surprised but readily accepted O\u2019Neal\u2019s offer. \u201cI was moved by it,\u201d he tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cI connected with him as a parent, a man, a Christian, and a police officer.\u201d\n\nPolice work also bonded the two men, says Tucker. \u201cSometime the family members of police officers are more taxed than those involved in the actual work,\u201d he tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cIf you let it, it will suck the life out of you.\u201d\n\nTucker says his line of work typically invites curiosity but not with such depth. \u201cIt was brave of Juan to approach me, in uniform and with my family,\u201d he tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, he\u2019s a wonderful young man.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The 21-year-old Florida college student said he felt compelled to pray over a police officer who was having dinner with his family.
