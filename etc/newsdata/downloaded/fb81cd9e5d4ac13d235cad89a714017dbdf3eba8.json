The tendency for voids to be filled may prove a problem for the European Central Bank\u2019s incoming boss, Christine Lagarde.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s boardroom will soon have another opening after Sabine Lautenschlaeger resigned late on Wednesday. The ECB gave no reason for the departure of the German more than two years before the scheduled end of her term. In the absence of any other justification, it is all too easy to suspect discontent at the loosening in monetary policy that the central bank\u2019s outgoing chief, Mario Draghi, announced two weeks ago.\n\nA number of policymakers, including Lautenschlaeger, dissented over that package, which included a new wave of asset purchases, sources have previously told Reuters. If her resignation was motivated by policy differences rather than personal reasons, Lagarde will face a couple of problems.\n\nFirst, the departure will make it even harder for her to sell ECB policies in Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy. The country\u2019s best-selling newspaper had already reacted to Draghi\u2019s recent measures by publishing a photomontage of the Italian with fangs and dressed as a vampire, alongside a headline about the continuing horror of sub-zero interest rates for German savers.\n\nIt is better for Lautenschlaeger to leave before Lagarde starts on Nov. 1. And she wouldn\u2019t be the first German to quit following a policy dispute. Juergen Stark, who opposed buying government bonds to combat the euro zone crisis, stepped down as ECB chief economist in 2011. That didn\u2019t prevent the central bank from ploughing on with ever bolder stimulus measures.\n\nThe big difference this time is that the German wasn\u2019t the only dissenter. Other objectors included French central bank Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, ECB board member Benoit Coeure, also a Frenchman, and Estonia\u2019s central bank chief, sources have told Reuters. Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot is another critic. Together, they represent countries that account for more than half of the euro zone\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nLagarde will need all her fabled diplomatic skills to pour oil over such troubled waters. Even then, the divisions that predate her arrival may limit her room for manoeuvre in the future.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Nature abhors a vacuum.
