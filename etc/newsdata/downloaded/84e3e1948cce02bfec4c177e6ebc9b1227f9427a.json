That's why I used to wear f***ing sunglasses, baby boy!\u201d Bisping said as he took out the eye \u2013 to the horror of co-host Luis J.

I was just about able to scrape past the medicals. It was definitely touch and go\u2026\n\n\u201cTo pass the medical test, you\u2019ve got to have 20-200 vision, which is classed as clinically blind anyway, so it\u2019s not very good \u2013 it\u2019s not a very hard mark to pass.\n\n\"Some days I could, some days I couldn\u2019t.
