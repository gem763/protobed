(Image: Netflix)\n\nJason Isaacs loved being on The OA, and he\u2019s heartbroken about its loss.\n\nIn a new interview with Collider, Isaacs talks about what the show could have been, and what he was most excited for in the show that is now not to be.\n\n\u201cYeah, they mapped out all five seasons, when they pitched it, originally,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey wrote the whole first season on spec, and it took two years to write it. I think that\u2019s why the show had such a clearly unique voice. It was Zal [Batmanglij] and Brit [Marling], with nobody\u2019s interference. You know that old saying, \u201cA camel is a horse made by a committee.\u201d It\u2019s so much their voice. It resonated so much with their humanity, their authenticity, their beauty, and their desire for human connection. That\u2019s why it\u2019s touched so many people, so profoundly.\u201d\n\nHe continued, saying, \u201cWhen they told me the end of Season 2, I went, \u2018Wait, guys, are you actually sure? That sounds nuts to me. What can you possibly do afterwards?\u2019 So, they sat me down and told me, and 15 minutes later, my jaw was hanging open. I just couldn\u2019t wait to get started making it. And now, it looks like we won\u2019t be making it. I\u2019m sad, not just for the fans, but for me, because I was at the front of the line. I\u2019m such a huge fan of the show. I\u2019m dying to see the rest of the seasons because I know they happened in their heads, and I so enjoyed and was moved by the first two.\u201d\n\nThat season ending, by the by, involved Brit Marling and Jason Isaacs entering a world where they were actually Brit Marling and Jason Isaacs, instead of the characters they play on the show. And Isaacs was gearing up for that challenge when news of the cancellation came.\n\n\u201cMy head was spinning, with what the hell was going to happen, how I was going to do it, and what it was. And then, of course, it\u2019s not myself. It\u2019s Hap inside of some version of Jason Isaacs, in a universe that they were going to create, so there was all kinds of fantastic potential there for that. And it\u2019s a world in which Jason Isaacs is married to Brit Marling, by the way, which many people thought was true. They just were so smart at playing with those expectations, and coming up with things that were both interesting and clever, but also moving and human. And they changed the goalposts, all the time. Season 2 was so different from Season 1, and Season 3 was going to be very different from Season 2, as well. I feel sorry for everyone, and mostly sorry for me, that we won\u2019t get to watch it,\u201d he said.\n\nI\u2019m sad, too, Jason. It\u2019s good to know, at least, that if anyone ever finds a way to revive The OA, Marling and her co-writer Zal Batmanglij know exactly where the show would be going next.\n\nFor more, make sure you\u2019re following us on our new Instagram @io9dotcom.", "description": "Jason Isaacs loved being on The OA, and he\u2019s heartbroken about its loss....", "authors": ["Julie Muncy", "Rhett Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/iktymcshpp48ut1m98hb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
