Ernie Grunfeld is no longer the general manager, John Wall won\u2019t be playing anytime soon and few folks on the outside are pegging them for a playoff run.\n\nUnder the new organizational structure of \u201cMonumental Basketball,\u201d the Wizards are hitting reset.\n\n\u201cI like the expectations we have,\u201d coach Scott Brooks said at preseason media day on Monday. \u201cWe want to play hard and play well for one another. We want to win games. We\u2019re not going into the season knowing exactly what each player will be or become.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s partly because 13 of the 20 players on the Wizards\u2018 camp roster are new in town. Some came via trade, like former Grizzlies swingman CJ Miles and former Lakers Moritz Wagner, Isaac Bonga and Jemerrio Jones. The draft provided No. 9 overall pick Rui Hachimura and second-rounder Admiral Schofield, and the biggest-name player to sign this summer was point guard Isaiah Thomas.\n\nBut the Wizards were set back by a rash of pre-camp injuries to players like Miles and 2018 first-round pick Troy Brown Jr. Even Thomas will have his team debut delayed several weeks after needing surgery to repair a ligament in his thumb. All of that is on top of Wall, who might miss the entire season as he recovers from a ruptured Achilles tendon.\n\nBrooks said the Wizards won\u2019t rush Wall back to play and will use him like an assistant coach at practices, saying, \u201cIt\u2019d be silly on myself and our staff\u2019s part not to use his expertise and his experience on the coaching side.\u201d\n\nWall is on board with the cautious approach to his recovery, saying he has returned from injuries early before only to make something worse.\n\n\u201cWhenever the doctors clear me and anything like that, it\u2019s all up to John Wall,\u201d Wall said. \u201c\u2018How\u2019s your body feeling? Do you feel like you can go out there and play the game you love at the highest level?\u2019 So I\u2019m in no rush in my rehab process.\u201d\n\nAsked why owner Ted Leonsis had previously spoken about wanting to change the Wizards\u2018 team culture, Wall said the roster in the past had a lot of players on one-year contracts, which feeds pressure to put up statistics.\n\n\u201cEverybody (was) trying to play at a high level and make sure they get theirs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the front office is doing a great job just trying to have high-character guys, guys that want to play basketball the right way, great IQ. And also, what we said before, stuff that we go through as a team, you have to keep it as a group, as a family. Anything that gets outside kind of hurts your team and I think the last couple years that\u2019s what we dealt with.\u201d\n\nThe injuries being what they are, Brooks said three starting jobs for opening night are up for grabs: point guard and both forwards. Only Beal and center Thomas Bryant are sure to be part of that starting five.\n\nBeal, meanwhile, has until Oct. 21 to accept a three-year, $111 million extension the Wizards offered him. He reiterated he hasn\u2019t given it deep consideration yet, as his family was busy after welcoming their second son in late August.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, but I had my boy, so my family is what\u2019s most important for me,\u201d Beal said. \u201cI\u2019m letting my agent and Ted and Tommy work through the details. I\u2019m just taking my time.\u201d\n\nThe Wizards\u2018 first preseason game is Oct. 7 at home against the New York Knicks.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
