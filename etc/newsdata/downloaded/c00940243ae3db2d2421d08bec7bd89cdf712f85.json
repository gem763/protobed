One of the toughest of all transitions is getting everyone \u201cup and out\u201d in the morning. Here are some tips that may be helpful.\n\nRelevant Reading: How to Make Back to School Transitions Less Traumatic for the Whole Family\n\nPlan for extra time so you can match your child\u2019s pace\n\nFeeling rushed puts pressure on children and adds stress. So, look for ways to make your mornings less rushed. Try getting up a half an hour earlier. Get clothes, lunches and backpacks ready the night before.\n\nGive a preview\n\nTalk to your child about the day ahead \u2014 that they are going to school or daycare, and you are going to work. Remind them that they will spend the day with their friends and that you will see them again at the end of the day.\n\nOffer choices\n\nLet your child make important choices about appropriate options like what shirt to wear or what to take for one of their snacks. This can help your child have a sense of control.\n\nCheck in with the caregiver\n\nIf you take your child to school or daycare, drop-off or pickup time can be an opportunity to have a brief chat with the teacher or caregiver about how your child is doing. You could explain, for example, if your child had a difficult morning or slept poorly the night before. At the end of the day, find out how their day went.\n\nReconnect after you get home\n\nTry to spend the first few minutes after you return home giving your child undivided attention. Some young children would love to be held or rocked for a few minutes to reconnect. Other children might just want to be near you, doing quiet things \u2014 they just want to be able to have your attention before you get into your chores.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if your child falls apart shortly after you pick him up from child care. This is normal. Children often save up their strong feelings all day and let them out when they get home.\n\nSo, basically, transitions are hard. And your kids might be really emotional about them. But there are many ways to make them a bit smoother so everyone's a little happier.\n\nCreate routines\n\nDaily routines that are fairly consistent help children know what to expect, which makes transition times a little easier.\n\nVisual reminders\n\nIf there are some parts of getting ready that you want your kids to do on their own, create a chart with pictures of what you need them to do (brush teeth, get dressed, pack their backpack, etc.).\n\nThe 5-minute warning\n\nThere\u2019s nothing magic about five minutes \u2014 you may choose 15 minutes or a half-hour, especially for an older child. But the point is, a positive, friendly reminder of when kids need to leave or switch to another activity helps them get psychologically ready for transitions.\n\nUse a timer\n\nSetting the timer on your microwave clock or cell phone helps make short timelines more real for children, while providing both audio and visual cues.\n\nKeep kids in the loop\n\nExplain what\u2019s happening. Make sure your children understand what is going to happen and what they need to do and when. For example, at the breakfast table, you can have a quick \u201chere\u2019s what\u2019s happening today\u201d mini meeting. If kids feel included in planning they are more likely to go along with it.\n\nTry using music signals\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why daycares and kindergartens use bits of music to signal transition times (e.g. sing a clean-up or goodbye song). The music provides a pleasant cue that reminds children that it\u2019s time for a change. Music signals may or may not work as well in your home, but they are worth a try if you\u2019re having trouble with transitions.\n\nLet them take a toy\n\nAllowing kids to choose a small toy to take with them when you have to go somewhere is comforting and gives them something nice to focus on.\n\nPraise good behaviour\n\nWe often notice and point out when kids are dawdling or not getting ready fast enough. But be sure to point out and praise kids for when they do well with transitions!\n\nHas something worked for you that I haven't touched on?
