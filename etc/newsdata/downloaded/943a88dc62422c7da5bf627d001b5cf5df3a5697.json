Pricing failure was the second highest cost of waste at up to $240.5 billion.\n\nAmong other categories, failure of care delivery costs up to $165.7 billion, failure of care coordination costs up to $78.2 billion, over-treatment or low value care cost up to $101.2 billion, and fraud and abuse up to $83.9 billion.\n\nThe potential savings identified by researchers from waste interventions across several categories, excluding administrative complexity, was up to $282 billion, representing a 25 percent reduction in the total cost of waste.\n\nThough administrative complexity was the biggest source of waste, \u201cthere were no generalizable studies that targeted administrative complexity as a source for waste reduction,\u201d the report noted.\n\n\u201cThe United States spends more on health care than any other country,\u201d the report also noted, with costs nearing 18 percent of the gross domestic product.\n\nPrevious studies have estimated the total cost of waste in healthcare is about 30 percent of total spending.", "description": "Oct. 7 (UPI) \u2014 The Journal of the American Medical Association said Monday that roughly one quarter of total health care spending in the United", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
