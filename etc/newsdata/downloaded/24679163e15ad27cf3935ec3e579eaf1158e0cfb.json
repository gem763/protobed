Adding flux to the data was the EIA\u2019s measure of output, which the agency estimated had risen to a record high of 12.6 million barrels per day for the week ended Oct 4.\n\nSuch a record high was \u201cremarkable, considering the U.S. rig count is at a two-year low,\u201d Investing.com analyst Barani Krishnan said.\n\nThe EIA said rose by about 2.9 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 4.\n\nAnalysts were expecting a rise of 1.4 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.\n\nsank by 1.2 million barrels, versus expectations for a drop of about 260,000. dropped by about 3.9 million barrels, compared with forecasts for a decline of about 2.1 million.\n\n\u201cThis is a pretty interesting dataset in the sense that it shows a fourth-straight week of crude builds, which are perfectly in line with post-driving season trends, while fuel inventories continue to collapse, surprising even bears in the market,\u201d Krishnan added.\n\n\u201cRefinery runs remain at least 10% below norm, which might explain the crude build,\u201d he said. \u201cBut imports were steadily under 7 million bpd and exports seem to be heading toward the 3.5 million bpd mark next.\u201d\n\nToward the market\u2019s settlement, however, both WTI and gave up much of their early gains after minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s September meeting, published on Wednesday, showed market participants may be anticipating more rate cuts than the central bank deemed necessary to stimulate the economy.\n\nSo far this year, the Fed has conducted two quarter-point rate cuts back to back in July and September, to try and preserve the U.S. economy's record decade-long growth. Market participants expect the Fed to agree on another quarter point cut when it meets Oct 29-30.", "description": "Oil Little Changed on Mixed Inventory Picture, Economic Woes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPECB60NB_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
