And a lawsuit filed on their behalf by the American Civil Liberties Union Thursday details just how distressing that separation could be.\n\nFiled in Arizona federal court on Thursday, the suit is the ACLU\u2019s latest attempt to fight the Trump administration's policies that resulted in thousands of migrant children being forcibly taken from their parents at the border over several months in 2018. When they were reunited, the government had trouble reuniting families because agencies failed to keep adequate records on which children arrived with which caretakers.\n\nIn some cases, kids who were too young to communicate were asked to point to their country\u2019s flag so officials could narrow down who their parents were and where they might be, according to the suit. And parents were even deported to their native countries without their children.\n\nREAD: The Trump Administration keeps losing family separation lawsuits\n\nThe suit filed Thursday seeks damages for every affected family, though the ACLU hasn\u2019t specified a dollar amount. Instead, it\u2019s seeking class-action status in the hopes of compensating thousands of migrants who were traumatized by the policy but may not have the resources to file on their own.\n\nHere's some of the worst treatment the families had to endure, according to the suit:\n\n\u201dTorn kicking and screaming\u201c\n\nJorge, a migrant from Honduras, was allegedly separated from his sleeping daughter in the middle of the night and did not get a chance to say goodbye. (Jorge and the other migrants in the suit are referred to by their first names or initials to protect their privacy.)\n\nThe two were being held in a Customs and Border Protection processing station, and when an officer told Jorge to leave the cell, the suit claims, Jorge assumed he was being taken in for questioning. Instead, he was transferred to an ICE detention facility.\n\nChildren who watched their parents get taken away didn't fare much better. Andr\u00e9s, a 6-year-old from Honduras, was \"torn kicking and screaming\" from his father's arms. His father, Jacinto, tried to tell immigration officers about his son\u2019s heart murmur during the traumatic scene. Andr\u00e9s was eventually sent to live with a foster family in New York, who he was told to call \u201cMom\u201d and \u201cDad,\u201d the suit claims.\n\nSigning away their rights\n\nThree of the migrant parents named in the lawsuit were allegedly told they needed to sign paperwork in English \u2014 which they couldn\u2019t read \u2014 either to help their cases or to reunite them with their children. But they were actually signing voluntary deportation forms, according to the lawsuit.\n\nImmigration officers allegedly told one woman, Lorena, that she needed to sign the forms to be reunited with her teenage daughter, who\u2019d been sent to a shelter before being transferred to foster care. After Lorena signed the form, though, she was deported to El Salvador without her daughter, and they didn\u2019t see each other for more than a year.\n\nREAD: Families separated at the border are seeking millions in damages.\n\nAnother parent, Jacinto, was also allegedly told to sign paperwork that immigration officers said would help with his asylum case, the suit claims. After he signed it, the same officer allegedly told him it was actually a removal form. Jacinto was deported to Honduras without his son, Andres, and waited more than a year to reunite.\n\nUnlike the others, a Guatemalan migrant named Jairo wasn\u2019t told signing papers would help his case. Instead, he was allegedly told that he\u2019d be deported regardless of whether he signed, but that signing the documents would help officials reunite him with his young daughter, Beatriz.\n\nInstead, Jairo was deported without her. And by the time Beatriz was reunited with her family, she had lost her ability to speak Mam, an indigenous Mayan language, making it nearly impossible for her to communicate with her mother.\n\nMocked or beaten\n\nMany of the parents mentioned in the complaint say they and their children were berated by Border Patrol and CBP agents. Lorena, the mother from El Salvador, claims one CBP officer mocked her after she told him where she was from, saying, \u201cFuck these Salvadorans.\u201d\n\nStaff members at Casa Kokopelli, a child migrant shelter run by the nonprofit organization Southwest Key, allegedly told Lorena\u2019s daughter Karina that she should go back to her country and tell other Salvadoran kids not to come to the U.S.\n\nRead: Former Southwest Key employee arrested for soliciting a migrant girl\n\nSome of the children named in the suit were also allegedly physically abused by shelter staff. Beatriz, the young Guatemalan girl who forgot her native language after spending several months away from her family, had bruises on her legs and a scar on her back when she was reunited with her father. When her father asked what caused the marks, the suit claims that Beatriz said a shelter staffer in New York hit her with the metal end of a belt.\n\nNot the first case\n\nThe ACLU filed its first suit against family separation last year, which sought to stop the policy and reunite parents and kids. But even after a federal judge ordered an end to zero tolerance last June, the ACLU found that more than 900 children had since been taken from their relatives by Customs and Border Protection, according to another lawsuit filed on behalf of those families in July.\n\nOther migrants who were emotionally affected by family separation have filed similar complaints. One group of asylum-seeking families sued the administration in September. That month, the ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of a Congolese woman who was pulled from her 7-year-old daughter. And in February, eight families filed a suit against the government that asks for $6 million in damages per family.\n\nCOVER: Border Patrol agents near McAllen, Texas take asylum seekers into custody on June 12, 2018, before sending them on to a facility where they'll be processed and potentially separated.
