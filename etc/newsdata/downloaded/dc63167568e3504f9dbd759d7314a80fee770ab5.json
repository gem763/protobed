As per ITNews Australia, ICS was built on IBM WebSphere.\n\nICS said the October 8 Patch Tuesday update \"caused worldwide issues for some users, including interoperability problems between some versions of Windows 10 systems and the Integrated Cargo System (ICS).\"\n\n\"The issue affects clients when attempting to login to the ICS portal using Internet Explorer,\" it added.\n\nThe agency explained that the update introduced a \"change in behaviour of the protocol establishing the security of the connection with ICS is causing authentication failures.\" It noted the update had \"caused worldwide issues for some users.\"\n\nInternet Explorer is of course on its way out as Microsoft pushes ahead with its Chromium-based version of the Microsoft Edge browser. Microsoft's October Patch Tuesday update included a fix for a critical remote code execution memory vulnerability.\n\nSome Windows 10 users who struggled with the October 8 security patches decided to uninstall the security update to overcome their problems. ABF also says that it is aware that some users have uninstalled the patch just so they can continue using the ICS website, which shows local businesses and citizens the status of their air and sea cargo, including perishable items, entering the world's largest island of 20 million-plus inhabitants.\n\nBut ABF advises Windows 10 users to take precautions when making the decision.\n\n\"We are aware that some users have removed the update to successfully restore connectivity. We recommend any decision to remove the security update is informed by an appropriate risk assessment and analysis,\" ABF said.\n\n\"Additional security controls to limit any risk associated with the removal of the patch such as the use of standalone machines should be considered.\"", "description": "Update busted access from Internet Explorer, preventing Internet Explorer users from accessing the status of imports to Australia.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/09/07/2b44f1c1-18ad-4cba-b605-e784a8a17d32/thumbnail/770x578/feede1cb2c401e65a734321a39cf00f8/hand-on-keyboard-610.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
