As members of Congress on this World Food Day, we hope that the universality of food\u2014and the knowledge that too many around us don\u2019t have enough to eat\u2014is a reality that can unite us.\n\nWe sit together on the House Agriculture Committee, where we chair the subcommittees with jurisdiction over domestic and international anti-hunger programs. We work on issues that cross lines between urban and rural, farm and food, and hunger and plenty. We recognize the potential of an American agriculture and food system that is the best in the world, but we also realize the reality that too many people still can\u2019t access enough of the bounty it provides.\n\nForty million Americans go hungry each day, and food insecurity is an issue in every county in the country. Sixteen million U.S. children and 5.4 million seniors live in households without enough to eat.\n\nIn Fresno, one in every three residents don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from, and 40 percent of those are kids.\n\nIn Northeast Ohio, 16 percent of Clevelanders are food insecure, including one in every five kids.\n\nWorldwide, 1.3 billion people lack access to sufficient food and more than 10,000 children die each day as a direct result of hunger.\n\nThis hunger, even if temporary, has lasting impacts in our local communities and around the world.\n\nWhile poverty leads to hunger, hunger is also an economic drain that worsens poverty. Adults who don\u2019t have enough to eat aren\u2019t as productive or efficient in the workplace. This can lead to reduced job opportunities and unemployment. Hunger costs the U.S. $167 billion in lost economic productivity each year.\n\nWithin the health care industry alone, we could save $71 billion through access to more nutritious food. This is one of the reasons we have the school lunch and breakfast program.\n\nInternationally, hunger can lead to political unrest, which then makes hunger worse by delaying or eliminating work in conflict regions to combat food insecurity. Currently, 60 percent of the world\u2019s hungry live in conflict areas, and ten of the world\u2019s 13 worst food crises are driven by conflict.\n\nWe are proud to help alleviate this need thorough the U.S. food aid system, which pairs U.S. farm goods with the people who need them most. This system is a win-win-win for hungry people, farmers, and the world. Hungry people get help when they need it most, farmers get additional markets for their products, and everyone gets a more secure and stable world.\n\nKey U.S. domestic and international anti-hunger initiatives, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Food for Peace, Food for Progress, and the McGovern-Dole Food for Education Programs, have taken great strides toward fighting domestic and global hunger. In 2017, SNAP lifted more than 3.4 million Americans out of poverty. Abroad, more than 4 billion people in 154 countries have benefited from U.S. food assistance. Last year, 2.5 million metric tons of U.S.-produced food and farm products went to help communities recover, become more resilient, and reduce their need for future aid.\n\nBut we still struggle to achieve a world without hunger. The current administration has pushed drastic cuts or complete elimination for SNAP, Food for Peace, McGovern Dole, and other programs. If we want to end hunger, we cannot allow opponents of these programs to frame the anti-hunger effort as zero sum \u2013 that helping someone means someone else must have less.\n\nWe are the most capable economy in the world, and the fact that so many of our children, our seniors, and our working parents go hungry is a disgrace. Anti-hunger programs combine to represent just over 2 percent of our federal budget. The fact that we are now questioning whether to be a global leader only adds more shame.\n\nWe can accomplish all these things if we can muster the courage.\n\nBut that means standing up to support food-insecure families both in the U.S. and elsewhere. At home and around the world, food is a national security issue.\n\nWhen better than World Food Day to recognize that?", "description": "We can accomplish all these things if we can muster the courage.
