Today 17 state attorneys general sued over it.", "language": "en", "text": "The administration would also be allowed to reveal, for the first time in the 45 years since the act was signed into law by the Nixon administration, the financial burden of protecting wildlife.\n\nRevealing the price tag and loss of potential development opportunities on protected land could open future threatened and endangered designations to challenges they have not face before now. Before the change, the act called for endangered plants and animals to be protected regardless of the cost.\n\nThe rules were changed as part of President Trump\u2019s effort to scale back government regulations on corporations, including the oil and gas industry, that want to drill on protected land.\n\n\u201cThe revisions finalized with this rulemaking fit squarely within the president\u2019s mandate of easing the regulatory burden on the American public, without sacrificing our species\u2019 protection and recovery goals,\u201d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in August. \u201cThese changes were subject to a robust, transparent public process, during which we received significant public input that helped us finalize these rules.\u201d\n\nNew Trump rules weaken wildlife protections\n\nOver nearly a half century, the Endangered Species Act has been credited with saving the bald eagle, American alligator, Florida manatee, grizzly bear, California condor, humpback whale and other animals from extinction. More than 1,500 plants and animals are currently listed as endangered or threatened.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to undo what the president is proposing to do with the Endangered Species Act,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) said during a news conference that was streamed online. Becerra added that the coalition was \u201ccoming out swinging\u201d to protect an act that plants and animals depend on.\n\nLed by California, Maryland and Massachusetts, the coalition filed its complaint in a federal court in California. Attorneys general in Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington also signed on to the lawsuit. Washington, D.C., and New York City are also in the coalition.\n\nThe coalition released a statement saying the administration\u2019s rollback of rules \u201cremoves current provisions that help prevent threatened species from becoming endangered or extinct.\u201d Among them are rules that ban capturing and killing some species, it said.\n\nNick Goodwin, an Interior Department spokesman, said in an email that the regulatory changes \u201care long overdue and necessary.\" He predicted that they \u201cwill recover more imperiled species facing extinction than previously accomplished over the span of this law.\u201d\n\nHe said that the administration will defend its rules in court. \"We will be steadfast in our implementation of this important act to improve conservation efforts across the country,\u201d Goodwin said.\n\nThe rule changes followed a United Nations report that said 1 million species worldwide face extinction as a result of human activity. Wednesday\u2019s lawsuit came on the heels of a separate report that 3 billion birds have been lost since the 1970s.\n\nConsidering those stakes, Becerra bemoaned the administration\u2019s actions. \u201cWhy we have to do a press conference on this is beyond me,\u201d he said. Becerra has filed more than 60 challenges to actions by the administration, 30 involving the environment.\n\nIn a statement, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) also criticized the timing of the administration\u2019s change. \u201cAs we face a climate emergency and global extinction crisis threatening more than a million species, the Trump Administration is gutting Endangered Species Act protections to pave the way for oil and gas developments,\u201d Healey said. \u201cWe are suing to defend federal law and protect our imperiled wildlife and environment.\u201d\n\nTheirs was the second coalition to challenge the administration. The lawsuit mirrors a complaint filed by environmental and animal rights groups about a week after the changes were announced.\n\nLike the attorneys, the conservationists argue that the administration failed to disclose how the changes would affect the environment, in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act.\n\nSome of the final rules \u201cwere never made public,\u201d the conservationists said, cutting American citizens \u201cout of the decision-making process.\u201d The earlier court challenge was filed by Earthjustice for the Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife, Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, National Parks Conservation Association, WildEarth Guardians, and the Humane Society of the United States.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is home to hundreds of endangered and threatened species, and wildlife that owes its continued existence to the Endangered Species Act, including the iconic bald eagle,\u201d Becerra said. \u201cAs we face the unprecedented threat of a climate emergency, now is the time to strengthen our planet\u2019s biodiversity, not to destroy it.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re coming out swinging,\u201d said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra.
