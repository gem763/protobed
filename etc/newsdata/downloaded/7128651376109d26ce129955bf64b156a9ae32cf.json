What exactly the consumer landscape will look like, though, and who will benefit, is where things get fuzzy.\n\nThe ranks of college-educated women in the workforce are expanding, while the wage gap between men and women is narrowing. More women are getting married later or forgoing matrimony altogether. Morgan Stanley economists calculate that growth in the number of single, working women will significantly outpace overall population growth in the years to come. Among those who do marry, the share of women outearning their husbands is growing.\n\nAll this points to more women playing a primary role in major family purchases. But Merrill Lynch economist Michelle Meyer points out that there has been surprisingly little hard research into issues such as spending patterns in families where women are primary breadwinners. Some insights, such as that women with more spending power will spend more on women\u2019s clothing, beauty and accessories, are important but also obvious. And some of the received wisdom, such as the oft-repeated statistic that women control 80% or more of spending, is, as The Wall Street Journal detailed in 2011, questionable.\n\nOne thing that does seem certain, says Ms. Meyer, is that as women earn a greater share of household income \u201cthey will have a greater contribution to how that income gets allocated.\u201d\n\nLabor Department data on how singles spend their money offers some insights into women\u2019s spending as a whole. Single women making $50,000 to $69,990 spend about the same amount on vehicle purchases as comparable men, for example, but allocate more money to new vehicles and less to used ones. Spending by women on \u201cother vehicles\u201d\u2014a category that includes motorcycles\u2014doesn\u2019t even register in the data.\n\nThe same data show single women spend substantially more on personal-care products and services, which one might expect, but they also spend much more caring for their pets. Education is another area where single women significantly outspend men, whereas they spend a lot less on alcohol than men do. Morgan Stanley also points to women\u2019s affinity for the off-price \u201ctreasure-hunt\u201d experience. This could include secondhand apparel platforms, as well as home goods and furniture.\n\nChanges in how women spend their time could also reshape how they spend their money. In 2018, women who worked full time worked and slept more on weekdays than they did in 2003, Labor Department figures show. In doing so, women spent less time participating in activities such as shopping and household chores. These changes could bolster e-commerce businesses, including the growing array of grocery delivery options and outsourced services through platforms like TaskRabbit. They also should augment the booming day-care industry, which is growing 4% annually and this year will generate $57 billion in the U.S., according to IBISWorld.\n\nMeanwhile, companies that produce traditionally male-oriented products, such as Harley-Davidson, could face a fresh set of challenges as more women take the wheel in family spending decisions. Others, such as car companies, may need to reconsider how they design their products.\n\nHow companies make and market products may also change. Field experiments conducted by Jens Hainmueller, then of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Michael Hiscox from Harvard University with Gap Inc. found sales increased among women when clothing came with labels detailing environmentally friendly manufacturing processes. The labels had no discernible impact on men. That suggests women are more supportive of environment-friendly products\u2014a finding that may also extend to other societal concerns.\n\nAll this spells opportunity for companies that recognize women\u2019s growing fiscal power and act accordingly.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What changes would you hope to see from companies to attract more women?
