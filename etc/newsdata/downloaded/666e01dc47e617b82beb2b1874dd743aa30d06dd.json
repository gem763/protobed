REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo\n\nMugabe, who ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years until he was ousted by his own army in November 2017, died in a Singapore hospital six days ago aged 95. His body arrived in Zimbabwe from Singapore on Wednesday and was due to lie in state on Thursday.\n\nHe is proving as polarising in death as he was in life, as the fight over where he will be buried threatens to embarrass his successor, President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nMnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party want Mugabe buried at a national monument to heroes of the liberation war against the white minority Rhodesian regime. The government had planned for a state funeral on Saturday and then burial on Sunday.\n\nBut some of Mugabe\u2019s relatives have pushed back against that plan. They share Mugabe\u2019s bitterness at the way former allies including Mnangagwa conspired to topple him and want him buried in his home village.\n\nLeo Mugabe, the late president\u2019s nephew, told Reuters the burial ceremony would be private, without saying where it would be.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you that it won\u2019t be private,\u201d he said.\n\nThe family later issued a statement saying it was concerned about the manner in which the government was preparing the programme for Mugabe\u2019s funeral \u201cwithout consulting his immediate family\u201d.\n\nThe family \u201calso observed with shock that the Government of Zimbabwe is attempting to coerce us to accept a programme for funeral and burial\u201d which was contrary to Mugabe\u2019s wishes, the statement said.\n\n\u201cWe are ready and willing to work with the government to develop a programme for the funeral and burial of the late Robert Gabriel Mugabe which is in conformance to his wishes on how his mortal remains will be interred,\u201d the family said.\n\nOn Thursday, ordinary Zimbabweans and supporters are expected to pay their last respects to Mugabe at a Harare soccer stadium, where the body will lie in state.", "description": "Zimbabwe's former president Robert Mugabe will be buried \"sometime next week\", a family spokesman said on Thursday, but it remained unclear where he would be interred amid disagreement between his family and government over the funeral plans.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429008106&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0KB-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
