(TSXV:BWR) (\u201cBWR\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to announce an exploration expenditure extension of one year pursuant to an amendment to the October 5, 2016 Agreement (the\u201d Agreement\u201d) with Puma Exploration Inc. (TSXV:PUMA) (\u201cPuma\u201d).\n\n\n\nSection 2(e) of the Little Stull Lake Property Agreement stipulates that if BWR does not incur exploration expenditures for an amount of at least $1,500,000 on the Little Stull Lake Property by October 5, 2019, BWR is required to issue within 30 days of October 5, 2019, 5,000,000 of the Company\u2019s shares to Puma. BWR has advised Puma that it has not to date expended the $1,500,000 required pursuant to Section 2(e) of the existing Agreement. Having fallen short of the pre-agreed exploration expenditure, primarily due to lack of permission to explore the subject property, as issued by the Province of Manitoba (the \u201cCrown\u201d), BWR further advised Puma, that it is in the final stage of a lengthy process that involves the Crown implementing a new protocol process conceptually designed to streamline the early stage work permit application process with respect to First Nation concerns. BWR anticipates that the Crown will be recommending the issuance of a work permit containing various conditions agreed to with First Nation communities that have treaty interests in the project area shortly.\n\nConsequently, BWR and Puma have agreed to amend the Agreement as follows:\n\nBWR shall issue to Puma 1,000,000 shares of the Company on or before November 4, 2019 the Agreement is amended as follows: subparagraph ii) of Section 2(b) is deleted, and paragraph (e) of Section 2 of the Agreement is amended as follows: the period of \u201c36 months\u201d is replaced by a period of \u201c48 months\u201d, thereby extending the time period in which the Company must occur expenditures to the Little Stull Lake Property in Manitoba, and the amount of \u201c5,000,000\u201d shares is replaced by \u201c4,000,000\u201d in order to maintain the total share allotment of Puma given that 1,000,000 shares of the Company are being transferred to Puma on or before November 4, 2019.\n\nAll other terms of the Agreement continue in full force and effect, unamended as of the date hereof. Capitalized terms not defined in this letter have the respective meanings accorded to them in the Agreement.\n\nThis amendment to the original agreement may be subject to regulatory approval, which will be sought if so required.\n\nBWR is currently in the process of raising $300,000 as disclosed in an earlier release (September 11, 2019), of which $146,000 has closed in a first tranche. This financing remains open until October 25, 2019 as per a conditional approval letter issued to the Company by the TSX Venture Exchange.\n\nBWR Exploration Inc. is a public company focused on exploring for base and precious metals, with its flagship Little Stull Lake Gold Project in NE Manitoba along with other exploration projects in Northern Ontario, and Northern Quebec, Canada. Management of BWR includes an accomplished group of exploration/mining specialists with many decades of operational experience in the junior resource sector in Canada and abroad.
