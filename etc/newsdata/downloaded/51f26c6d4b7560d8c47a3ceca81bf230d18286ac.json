SUPPLY WHAT'S IN DEMAND\n\nCareer expert Michelle Gibbings (pictured) said strategically relocating to rural or remote areas could significantly increase your salary\n\nIn saturated industries where hundreds of people boast the same skill set, jobs can be hard to secure and wages are often low.\n\nIn contrast, sectors which have a shortage of skilled workers are easier to break into and offer greater bargaining power when it comes to negotiating salary.\n\nMs Gibbings stressed the importance of consistently monitoring the jobs market to identify lucrative openings and to gauge what industries are booming.\n\n'It's basic law of economics - supply and demand. If you've got a highly valued skill and demand is high for it - go to that area. It's easier to negotiate a higher wage,' she said.\n\nAccording to Ms Gibbings, there is currently a shortage of skilled project managers and IT professionals in Australia.\n\n2. STRATEGICALLY RELOCATE\n\nSecuring a thicker pay packet may require moving to where an opening is, rather than waiting for the job to come to you.\n\nWhat jobs can earn you $100,000 without a degree in Australia? * Power plant operator - $100,000 * Procurement manager - $105,000 * Construction manager - $111,000 * Experienced miner - $117,000 * IT manager - $120,000 * Air traffic controller - $134,000\n\nRelocating to a rural area, even temporarily or for a few weeks each month, provides new opportunities, particularly in mining, construction and some service industries.\n\nIn many cases, financial loadings are included in the base salary to attract people to remote regions.\n\n3. THINK OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY-SHAPED BOX\n\nWhile some of Australia's biggest earners work in fields that require a degree, if not a masters, there is also a laundry list of professions that offer impressive salaries with no degree needed.\n\nConstruction managers, air traffic controllers, miners and power plant operators all earn in excess of $100,000 annually without the need for a bachelor's degree.\n\nThe average take-home pay for an air-traffic controller is $134,000.\n\nJobs in the mining and construction industry also offer six-figure sums, with moderately experienced mine workers securing $117,000 per year and site managers earning a median of $111,000.\n\nMeanwhile, power plant operators can earn up to $100,000.\n\nLearning and training is still important as many of these roles still require accreditation or certification.\n\nFreelance work is a great way of bulking your bank balance, but always remember to make provision for unpaid sick and holiday leave (stock image)\n\n4. ESTABLISH YOURSELF AS THE 'GO-TO' EXPERT\n\nMs Gibbings believes that when a person is the ultimate, all-knowing expert in their field, work finds them.\n\n'We are prepared to pay more for the services and skills of someone who is deemed an expert,' she said.\n\nAn expert is someone who has spent considerable time establishing an external brand and reputation by speaking at industry conferences, hosting seminars, building a following on social media or writing a book.\n\n5. GO FREELANCE\n\nThe daily rate for contractors is usually higher than for permanent employees, making freelance a great way of bulking your bank balance.\n\nWhile this is weighted to take account of unpaid sick and holiday leave, freelancing can still result in overall higher take home pay at the end of the year.\n\n6. TAKE CALCULATED RISKS\n\nAchieving long lasting financial success may not be about having just one job, Ms Gibbings reminded.\n\nSustained success may involve developing a side hustle to generate additional income, something which is easier than ever before thanks to the advent of social media and online business resources.\n\n'Getting a highly paid job doesn't happen instantaneously, but with planning, focus and hard work you can be well on your way,' Ms Gibbings said.\n\n", "description": "Australian career coach Michelle Gibbings shared tips on fast tracking your career and bulking your bank balance without a degree, including strategically relocating and going freelance.", "authors": ["Alice Murphy For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/05/19380244-0-image-a-259_1570422636827.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
