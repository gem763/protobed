You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWith Dwayne Bravo and Lasith Malinga also failing to draw interest, that means the tournament will take place without Twenty20 cricket\u2019s top run-scorer and its two leading wicket-takers, all of whom had entered at the top reserve price of \u00a3125,000.\n\nInstead it was a member of the next generation, 21-year-old mystery spinner Rashid, who was widely touted as the prime pick and he was duly awarded the honour of being chosen first by Trent Rockets.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

David Ashdown/The Independent\n\nLancashire all-rounder Liam Livingstone was the only Englishman to earn the maximum payday, grabbed in the opening round by Birmingham Phoenix, but Sam Billings, Phil Salt, Liam Dawson, Tom Abell, Ravi Bopara and Lewis Gregory all commanded six-figure fees.\n\nOf the 13 individuals who landed the \u00a3125,000, almost half were Australian with Steve Smith and Mitchell Starc heading to Welsh Fire, while David Warner (Southern Brave), Aaron Finch (Northern Superchargers), Glenn Maxwell (London Spirit) and D\u2019arcy Short (Trent Rockets) also cashed in.\n\nAndre Russell was the day\u2019s second pick, by Southampton\u2019s Southern Brave, with Sunil Narine and Mujeeb-ur-Rahman also among the highest earners.\n\nManchester Originals \u2013 coached by former Australia batsman Simon Katich \u2013 made the two most surprising early calls by investing a combined \u00a3250,000 in 40-year-old leg-spinner Imran Tahir, who had a base price of just \u00a360,000, and the relatively unheralded Dane Vilas.\n\nTwo of England\u2019s World Cup-winning XI were available, Mark Wood paired with Lord\u2019s-based London Spirit on a \u00a375,000 deal and Liam Plunkett making \u00a350,000 with Welsh Fire.\n\nOn a domestic level the competition for places left a handful of notable current or former England cricketers on the outside, including Olly Stone, Samit Patel, Jamie Overton, Sam Hain, Ian Bell, Rikki Clarke and Steven Finn.\n\nKieron Pollard of the West Indies also finds himself at a loose end having set a \u00a3100,000 base.\n\nThe likes of Luke Wright, Craig Overton, Laurie Evans, Jade Dernbach, Riki Wessels and Luke Fletcher \u2013 all experienced short-form campaigners \u2013 must have been fearing the same fate but were chosen in the final round at the minimum \u00a330,000 bracket.\n\nShane Warne, head coach of London Spirit, suggested Gayle, Malinga and Bravo were left unsold because they had overreached with their reserves.\n\n\u201cI think they priced themselves wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019d gone in at \u00a3100,000 and not \u00a3125,000 I think they\u2019d have been picked up.\u201d\n\nNorthern Superchargers counterpart Darren Lehmann added: \u201cIt was a tough one, they\u2019ve been superstars for so long but then the next generation is knocking on the door...you\u2019ve only got two picks at \u00a3125,000.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s man of the moment, Ben Stokes, who edged Test captain Joe Root as the landmark pick of the Headingley side, believes the competition represents a step up for the domestic calendar.\n\n\u201cOh yes, 100 per cent. Every game will be a big game, with so many people watching and playing against the very best in the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think we look like the best team on paper as we\u2019ve got all bases covered: power, spin and Ben Foakes as keeper \u2013 he\u2019s the best in England.\u201d\n\nSmith, who scored runs relentlessly in the recent Ashes series, appeared via videolink from Sydney to voice his approval of an enterprise that has been greeted with mixed opinions at home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be exciting, the first ever 100-ball comp and I\u2019m looking forward to joining Jonny Bairstow and Mitchell Starc,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit different and it\u2019ll be a learning curve for the first few games but it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "West Indian star Chris Gayle was overlooked as the eight teams for next year\u2019s inaugural season of The Hundred took shape in a televised player draft that saw Afghanistan spinner Rashid Khan emerge as number one pick.", "authors": ["Rory Dollard"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/21/08/Andre-Russell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
