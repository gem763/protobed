There is not point having a meaningless vote, the government would pull the motion.\n\n'The public want Brexit done. The government is determined to pass the PM's great new deal and get us out of the EU on Oct. 31 ... The deal with the EU has just been agreed, it is done, it is closed.\n\n'The negotiations with the EU have already gone on far too long.
