But there are signs it could be high. Notably, voter turnout was historically high in 2018 midterm elections when Democrats took control of the U.S. House of Representatives from Trump's fellow Republicans.\n\nIf turnout next year were historically high, Moody's said, the Democratic candidate could win Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania - states that narrowly voted for Trump in 2016 and which are currently experiencing a manufacturing slowdown. In that scenario, the Democratic candidate would win with 279 electoral votes to Trump's 259, Moody's said.\n\n\"If the U.S. economy sticks to our script over the next year, record turnout is vital to a Democratic victory,\" Moody's said.\n\nMoody's did not take into account who will be the eventual Democratic nominee. Twelve top White House contenders will take part on Tuesday in the first Democratic debate since the launch of an impeachment inquiry into Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate.\n\n(Reporting by Jason Lange; Editing by Will Dunham)", "description": "A strong U.S. economy could help President Donald Trump win re-election next year unless there is a surge in voter turnout, economic research firm Moody's Analytics said on Tuesday.
