Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced a resolution to condemn the Democratic-led impeachment probe against President Trump on Thursday afternoon. The measure will demand that lawmakers grant Trump the same due process as was given to former Presidents Clinton and Nixon.\n\nThe Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry against Trump last month based on a whistleblower complaint alleging Trump had threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine if they refused to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter during a phone conversation in July. Trump denied any quid pro quo and said the call was \"perfect.\"\n\n\"To me, it\u2019s not an impeachable offense,\" Graham agreed on Thursday. \"I have no problem with the phone call.\u201d\n\nThe senator added that the impeachment inquiry isn't only partisan, but \"dangerous.\"\n\nLindsey Graham calls the House impeachment process a \u201cdanger to the future of the presidency.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you can drive down a president\u2019s poll numbers\u201d while pursuing impeachment in closed-door meetings, he says, then \u201cGod help future presidents.\u201d pic.twitter.com/wQAKixOBFj \u2014 Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) October 24, 2019\n\n\"It is dangerous to the president,\" Graham said, adding it is a \"danger to the future of the presidency.\"\n\nThe Democrats, he said, are going \"off script.\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has been holding closed door testimony the past few weeks with three select committees, which prompted Republicans like Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) to storm the depositions on Wednesday. Gaetz claims that as a member of the Judiciary Committee, which launched the inquiry, he should be granted permission to these testimonies.\n\nGraham didn't introduce his resolution without ripping the press for what he deemed a double standard.\n\n(Warning: graphic language)\n\nGraham suggests press is giving Dems a pass on impeachment process: \"If Republicans did this, you would beat the shit out of me...What they\u2019re doing selectively leaking information to drive poll numbers down and increase impeachment numbers...\" \u2014 Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) October 24, 2019\n\nYou can read Graham's full resolution against the Democrats here.", "description": ".10/24/2019 20:37:39PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Bronson Stocking", "Sarah Lee"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/196/1d171185-77e0-46fa-8678-db4840eabee2.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
