(ACRG-U.CN)(ACRGF), suggesting shares are underpriced given the company\u2019s potential to be acquired by Canopy Growth Corp. (WEED.TO)(CGC) should U.S. cannabis sales become federally permissible. HEXO Corp. (HEXO.TO)(HEXO) also received a \u201cbuy\u201d rating based on the company\u2019s perceived brand-building potential.\n\nKirk issued \u201csell\u201d ratings on Curaleaf Holdings Inc. (CURA.CN)(CURLF) based on review data from Yelp and Leafly, and Aurora Cannabis Inc. (ACB.TO)(ACB) based on exposure to flat medical consumption growth.\n\nCanopy Growth, Cronos Group Inc. (CRON.TO)(CRON), and Tilray Inc. (TLRY) received \u201cneutral\u201d ratings.\n\nYahoo Finance Canada More\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "description": "The future of cannabis is looking less profitable, according to an analyst who initiated coverage on five Canadian pot producers and two U.S. multi-state operators on Friday.", "authors": ["Jeff Lagerquist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qL_eGxYN9OS4ICrqXsyrUA--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/54953230-dbdd-11e9-afb6-ff7786613014", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
