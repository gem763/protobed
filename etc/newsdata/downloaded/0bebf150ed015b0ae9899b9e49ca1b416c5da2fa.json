Wong was accused of \u201cconspiring to commit criminal damage\u201d and \u201centering or remaining in the Legislative Council chamber\u201d, said the pro-democracy Demosisto party, while Lau was accused of the same offences, according to the timeline of his Facebook account.\n\nMeanwhile, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and a delegation of more than 240 people, including pro-China politicians, business leaders and media bosses flew to Beijing to attend Tuesday\u2019s celebrations.\n\nIn Beijing, president Xi Jinping and other top leaders paid tribute to Mao Zedong at his mausoleum and presented flowers at the monument of the People\u2019s Heroes in Tiananmen Square on Monday, which is Martyrs\u2019 Day in China.\n\n'They don't understand Hong Kong': clash of ideologies looms on China's 70th anniversary Read more\n\nChinese authorities have tightened security in the run-up to the national day celebrations. Propaganda billboards and banners with patriotic messages have been hung across Beijing, and there is a heavy police presence in and around the capital as well as strict security controls at metro and railway stations. Traffic is being controlled on streets near Tiananmen Square, where a military parade and the ceremony are scheduled to take place. Even at hospitals, non-emergency operations have been called off.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Soldiers march past the image of Mao Zedong in Tiananmen Square on Monday.

Ding Zilin, 82, a founder of the Tiananmen mothers group whose son died in the military crackdown in 1989, and other members were told police would stand guard outside their homes, while dissident journalist Gao Yu and activist Hu Jia were made to travel outside Beijing. Others living outside the capital have also been harassed or lost contact with their friends.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Lau has organised many district protests in the past and has applied to hold a rally \u201cPray for Hong Kong\u201d in the central business district on Monday evening, which is expected to be peaceful.\n\nThe intimidation of activists in the run-up to China\u2019s national day went beyond Hong Kong. Singer and activist Denise Ho, who earlier this month urged members of the US Congress to pass legislation to combat human rights abuses in Hong Kong, was attacked in Taiwan on Sunday by a masked man who threw red paint at her at a rally in support of Hong Kong.

There were violent clashes in busy shopping and business districts as police used teargas, rubber bullets, pepper spray and water cannon against protesters, while activists hurled bricks and petrol bombs back at the police and started street fires. A police statement on Monday said an officer fired one warning shot into the sky after police were surrounded by protesters.\n\nMore than 100 protesters were arrested on Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported, quoting police sources.\n\nPolice have been using increasing force on protesters and even journalists. A 39-year-old Indonesian journalist sustained a serious eye injury after being shot in the face by a beanbag round or rubber bullet during Sunday\u2019s protest, reported the paper. She was wearing a helmet and goggles at the time.\n\nThe authorities have made life difficult for protesters. On Sunday, the metro company MTR closed at least four stations along the demonstration route, and police occupied footbridges where protesters usually gather. Police were also stationed in front of a church where protesters have previously sought refuge, and searched people entering and leaving the church. Shopping centres and many shops also closed.\n\nAdditional reporting by Lillian Yang", "description": "Crackdown begins on high-profile activists in Hong Kong and the mainland ahead of 70th anniversary", "authors": ["Verna Yu"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e20a59ff6e76daf48b5b53223e0144edac82d97/0_0_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2b369712a7095e293f334c8c4ee05f8c", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
