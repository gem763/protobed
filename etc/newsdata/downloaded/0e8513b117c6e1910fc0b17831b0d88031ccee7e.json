Water, toilet paper, long life cans.\"\n\nMurrells said that fruit like apples, pears, blueberries and strawberries might have to be transported more expensively via air freight from the Southern (NYSE: ) hemisphere to avoid congested ports.\n\nThe availability of vegetables in Britain is also at risk as the European Union provides some 86% of lettuces and 70% of tomatoes, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC).\n\n\"Clearly... in short-life fresh produce that's imported from Europe, that would be harder, if the flow of stock is interrupted,\" Rob Collins, the managing director of John Lewis' supermarket group Waitrose, told reporters.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to take Britain out of the European Union with or without a deal on Oct. 31, and has said he will not ask for a delay despite lawmakers voting that he seeks one to avoid a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe \"Operation Yellowhammer\" report on the worst case scenario released by the government pointed to potential problems snarling up cross-Channel trade routes and disrupting supplies of fresh food.\n\nJohn Lewis Chairman Charlie Mayfield said the assessment chimed with what his department store and supermarket group expected from a no-deal scenario.\n\n\"The publication of the Yellowhammer documents gives a bit more insight, but frankly I don't think it tells us anything particularly new that we didn't already know,\" Mayfield told reporters after warning that the impact of a no-deal Brexit could be \"significant\".\n\nMayfield went on to say that the continuing uncertainty meant that consumer confidence had taken a battering and John Lewis was seeing a reluctance by consumers to make big ticket purchases in its department stores.\n\nDavid Potts, Chief Executive of grocer Morrisons, agreed that consumer confidence was weak but the grocer is somewhat shielded from any Brexit chaos as two thirds of what it sells is British.\n\nWhile supermarkets say they are restricted in what goods they can stockpile, there might be some solace in the fact that they say so far, customers have shown little sign of panic-buying.", "description": "Britain won't run out of toilet paper but fruit could be in short supply after Brexit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8B0WZ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
