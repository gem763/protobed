From a welfare point of view, this animal suffered hugely.\n\n\u2018It was a very chronic entanglement and it had been there for weeks, if not months.\u2019\n\nAlthough the source of the rope is not known, Dr Brownlee says everyone has a responsibility to ensure a situation like this never happens again.\n\nHe added: \u2018It\u2019s very hard to say where the rope came from, we don\u2019t know whether or not this was from fishing or not.\n\nThe Sowerby\u2019s beaked whale was found on Gullane Beach, East Lothian (Picture: Kennedy News)\n\n\u2018What is worth highlighting is if we want to make a change it\u2019s not about pointing at a particular industry and saying \u201cit\u2019s all your fault\u201d \u2013 everybody has a role in this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You can be involved in a beach clean, you can choose where you buy your food from to make it sustainable and as environmentally benign as possible.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
