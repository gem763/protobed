(Other parents, including \u201cFull House\u201d star Lori Loughlin, have been accused of paying tens of thousands in bribes to get their kids into elite schools.)\n\nThe \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star was sentenced to 14 days in prison, beginning Oct. 25, followed by a year of supervised release and 250 hours of community service. Huffman was also hit with a $30,000 fine. She said that she accepted the court\u2019s decision \u201cwithout reservation.\u201d\n\nHuffman\u2019s lawyers had asked for a 12-month probation and a $20,000 fine, while prosecutors were pushing for at least a month in jail. Assistant U.S. attorney Eric Rosen argued ahead of sentencing that what Huffman wanted was no punishment at all. \u201cA $20,000 fine for someone worth in the tens of millions amounts to little more than a rounding error,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd many public reactions echoed that sentiment, particularly when comparing Huffman\u2019s case to that of a homeless Bridgeport, Conn., mom Tanya McDowell, a woman of color who was sentenced to five years in jail for sending her son to an elementary school in the wrong school district. And there was a homeless and mentally ill man (also black) who spent almost four years in jail for shoplifting four pairs of socks from Bloomingdale\u2019s in Manhattan in 2017. Last week, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office was also called out for sentencing a man to 30 days in Rikers Island for stealing a loaf of bread.\n\nThat's what white privilege and $$$$ can do for you just ask her https://t.co/5UzgLtYtmU \u2014 NIXXISBACK (@nixxisback) September 13, 2019\n\nFelicity Huffman intended to steal a college admissions from some other child. She got a 14-day sentence.\n\n\n\nA black teenager in Georgia stole a pair of shoes and got 5 years in prison.\n\n\n\nAnd that is how white and wealthy privilege works. \u2014 JRehling (@JRehling) September 13, 2019\n\nthe Felicity Huffman sentence reminds of a Daily News cover from this week pic.twitter.com/FpfqTVbNqC \u2014 Matt Mittenthal (@mattmittenthal) September 13, 2019\n\nPrior to the sentencing, Huffman had written an impassioned letter to the judge where she said she found motherhood \u201cbewildering\u201d and, \u201cIn my desperation to be a good mother, I talked myself into believing that all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot.\u201d Her actor husband William H. Macy and \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d co-star Eva Longoria had also sent letters asking for leniency for Huffman.\n\nRelated: Felicity Huffman\u2019s letter to the judge contains one glaring omission about her role in the college-admissions scandal\n\nHuffman\u2019s sentencing also spurred many on social media to start speculating about Loughlin\u2019s fate, as Huffman had taken a plea deal and still got some jail time \u2014 yet Loughlin rejected the deal.\n\nWonder what #loriloughlin is thinking now \u2014 she\u2019s chosen to go trial after allegedly paying a $500,000 bribe. Huffman only paid $15,000 to boost her daughter\u2019s SAT score and pleaded guilty. https://t.co/UYD0SH0G05 \u2014 Alex DiPrato (@AlexDiPrato) September 13, 2019", "description": "Many on social media compared her case to people locked up for years after stealing socks or a loaf of bread.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR308_felici_ZG_20190913164816.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
