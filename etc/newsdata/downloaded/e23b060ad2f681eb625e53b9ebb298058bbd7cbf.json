As such, the company, also known as JR East, is one of Japan\u2019s most visible corporations, and this week it announced that its uniforms are going to look different come the spring.\n\nJR\u2019s last major uniform update seems to have been in 2003, and after roughly a decade and a half it\u2019s decided that some changes are in order. For starters, the primary color scheme will move from gray to navy blue, a color that JR East says carries a sense of \u201ctraditional dignity,\u201d and works well with the company\u2019s aim to create a style that \u201cInstills a feeling of trust and security in our customers, while being a symbol of pride and comfortable for our employees to wear.\u201d\n\n\u25bc JR East\u2019s new uniforms\n\nThe new designs do still have a bit of gray color with their sleeve accent lines (two lines denoting a stationmaster, and one lower-ranking employees). However, one thing that\u2019s not being carried over from the previous designs is skirts, and they\u2019ve been abolished from the women\u2019s uniforms and replaced by pants.\n\n\u25bc JR East women\u2019s station staff uniforms introduced in 2003.\n\nAlso getting the ax: the women\u2019s uniform ribbons tied at the neck. The new standard uniforms will require women to wear neckties, just as the men\u2019s uniforms traditionally have, with employees allowed to choose between one of three designs. Both men and women will also be able to choose between high-peaked caps (previously only part of the men\u2019s uniform) and high-backed Tyrolean hats (previously only part of the women\u2019s uniform). Special \u201cCool Biz\u201d uniforms, to be worn during electricity conservation periods and allow for less intensive air conditioning, allow both men and women to go with no neckties and their collars unbuttoned.\n\n\u25bc The pictures also seem to imply that the new uniforms will allow flats instead of heels for women, perhaps in response to the recent backlash against mandated pumps in the workplace in Japan.\n\n\u25bc Alternate stationmaster uniforms\n\nJE East says the new uniforms are part of its ongoing Reform 2027 regulation revision project, which was begun last year. In the uniforms\u2019 press release, it says that the update is being carried out \u201con the occasion of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics,\u201d and JR East president Yuji Fukasawa further explained that \u201cWe decided on these uniforms with the intent of eliminating gender differences,\u201d though this has prompted some online commenters to ask why JR East doesn\u2019t instead offer both men and women the choice of wearing skirts, like this Japanese middle school does.\n\nThe new uniforms will go into use on May 1.\n\nSources: JR East via Otakomu, JR East, Mainich Shimbun\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Japan Railways wants to build a team of robots to help travelers, catch criminals in its stations\n\n-- Japanese public school to allow male students to wear skirts, chest ribbons as part of uniform\n\n-- Tokyo\u2019s busiest train stations have a new, free, English-compatible navigation app\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/10/east-japan-railway-abolishes-skirts-ribbons-in-womens-uniforms-to-eliminate-gender-difference/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "East Japan Railway Company is the primary rail operator in the most populous part of Japan, with dozens of lines in the Tokyo area alone as well as the Joetsu, Hokuriku, and Tohoku Shinkansen bullet trains.
