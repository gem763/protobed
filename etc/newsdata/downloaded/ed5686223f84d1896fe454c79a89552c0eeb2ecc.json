One community manager was not aware of the situation. That person worked in a building that opened in 2018.\n\nBut another, who reportedly joined the company in March at a newer building in Midtown Manhattan, said that the fumes \"has been a major issue for us.\"\n\nWeWork placed warning signs on the phone booths at a Seattle WeWork location Xen Eldridge\n\nMaureen Surkein, a tenant of WeWork's Victory Park location in Dallas, says she regularly spent up to three hours per day in phone booths there conducting meetings or taking lunch breaks before she learned of the formaldehyde risk on Monday.\n\nSurkein is 18 weeks pregnant, and is now afraid that she could experience side effects \u2014 according to the CDC, exposure to formaldehyde can trigger a miscarriage. Surkein said she plans to pursue legal action against WeWork if she experiences problems with her pregnancy.\n\n\"I am very angry that I and my unborn child may have been exposed to this chemical. Honestly, how dare they not take this issue more seriously,\" Surkein wrote in an email to Business Insider. \"It honestly makes me scared to come into work.\"\n\nWeWork declined comment. However, in an email sent to its tenants on Monday warning them about the situation, the company advised them to seek medical treatment if they believe they've been affected by formaldehyde. In that email, obtained by Business Insider, WeWork said it was removing 1,600 phone booths from various locations in addition to 700 booths that have yet to be tested for formaldehyde.\n\nAs we previously reported, some tenants at other New York buildings notified WeWork about noxious chemicals in its offices' phone booths as early as August, according to emails obtained by Business Insider.\n\nAnd a tenant of the Seattle WeWork described to Business Insider experiencing eye irritation after using phone booths beginning in July.\n\nWeWork declined to comment on the Slack messages. A WeWork representative previously told Business Insider that WeWork took action to remove the phone booths as soon as tests for high levels of formaldehyde came back positive late last week.\n\nGot a tip?
