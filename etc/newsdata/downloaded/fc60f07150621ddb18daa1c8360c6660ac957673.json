When I was busiest, I worked for 30 films all at the same time. I had my own children but I didn\u2019t have the time to raise them.\u201d\n\nDespite its economic advances, South Korea remains a conservative society where until 2015 anyone indulging in extramarital sex risked a prison sentence.\n\nKim married four times at a time when divorced women often faced enduring stigma and isolation.\n\nHer spouses include a famed filmmaker, a star singer, and top actor Choi Moo-ryong, who was married to another woman when he started dating Kim.\n\nThe two superstars were the highest-profile couple to be jailed for breaking the adultery law, spending about a week in prison in the early 1960s.\n\nThey eventually married, but the union ended six years later.\n\n\u201cHuman beings have feelings, and therefore their minds can change,\u201d Kim told AFP. \u201cAnd when things are bad and you know you can\u2019t bear it, I don\u2019t think you should simply endure. You should get out and better yourself.\n\n\u201cAt the time I caused an unprecedented social scandal, but I think I\u2019ve taken responsibility for all of my actions,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived my life with a sense of dignity.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Anything men can do\u2026\u2019 \u2013\n\nKim was spotted aged 17 by late director Kim Ki-young, whose works continue to inspire many South Korean cineastes and their movies, including \u201cParasite\u201d by Palme D\u2019or winner Bong Joon-ho.\n\n\u201cHe was a bit of an oddball,\u201d the actress said of Kim.\n\n\u201cHe would often give no direction and guidance on acting. When he didn\u2019t like something, he would just walk away and scratch his head from afar.\n\n\u201cThere were many instances where I didn\u2019t understand what was going on. But I understand things differently now. I think he was a genius.\u201d\n\nShe moved into production to make more socially critical movies, starting with 1986\u2019s \u201cTicket\u201d \u2014 in which she also starred as the madam of a coffee delivery service staffed by women made to provide sex services.\n\nFor the movie \u2014 one of those screened at the festival \u2014 Kim and renowned director Im Kwon-taek interviewed several women working in so-called \u201cticket cafes\u201d in the port of Sokcho.\n\n\u201cWe would pay for their coffee delivery service so they can come to our hotel, and listen to their stories for days in tears,\u201d she told AFP.\n\n\u201cThis was a period when the whole country was beyond excited because we were going to hold the Seoul Olympics (1988), but in reality impoverished women were being forced into such work in order to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cI was shocked and as a woman I was extremely infuriated.\u201d\n\nBefore the screening the film faced censorship from the then military government \u2014 which claimed the movie \u201ccouldn\u2019t possibly be based on true stories\u201d \u2014 and a number of scenes had to be cut from the original version before it hit theatres.\n\nA previous project, a tale about a traditional courtesan becoming a nun, was never completed because of strong opposition from the nation\u2019s Buddhist orders who thought the film\u2019s theme too provocative.\n\n\u201cKim reigned as the most beautiful woman in South Korea for the longest possible time,\u201d BIFF programmer Jung Mi told AFP.\n\n\u201cBut Kim also has been a self-reliant woman and a strong human being.\n\n\u201cIn the field of cinema \u2014 where sexism can be at its worst within South Korea\u2019s male-dominated society \u2014 Kim has always remained in the mainstream and never been an outsider.\u201d\n\nThe actress headed a Korean cineastes\u2019 rights group in the 1990s, and her wide network of friends and acquaintances included the South\u2019s late president and Nobel laureate Kim Dae-jung.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been ambitious,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything men can do, women can do too.\u201d", "description": "Busan (South Korea) (AFP) \u2013 One of the most prolific actresses of all time, Kim Ji-mee has been dubbed South Korea\u2019s Elizabeth Taylor for her", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/858f23_as-an-actress-producer-kim-ji-mee-featured-in-700-films-retiring-in-1990s-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
