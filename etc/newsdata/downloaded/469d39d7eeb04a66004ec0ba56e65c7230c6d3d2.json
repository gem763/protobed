It can also be a great time to start a business.\n\nThat was the case for Paul A. Dillon, of the Raleigh-Durham, N.C. area. He retired as a managing director at the RSM McGladrey accounting firm in 2006, just shy of his 61st birthday, but didn\u2019t slow down.\n\nInstead, Dillon started his own firm, Dillon Consulting Services. And the former U.S. Army Reserve 1st Lieutenant, who fought in the Vietnam War, founded Bunker Labs, a startup incubator for veterans. He\u2019s also working with the nonprofit mentoring group Entredot to start a support program for aspiring veteran entrepreneurs in North Carolina, known as Bunker RDU.\n\nA consulting client led Dillon to help veterans. That was \u201ca dream that I\u2019ve had for many years,\u201d Dillon said.\n\n5 reasons to start a business in retirement\n\nHere are five reasons you, too, might want to start a part-time business in retirement:\n\n1. You get an opportunity to work\n\nWhen you\u2019re in your 60s, it can be difficult to find employers willing to hire you to work part-time, despite your experience and knowledge. Becoming your own boss takes care of that potential obstacle.\n\nSays Nancye Rivera, who decided to start Plus Bookkeeping Services in Chicago at age 60: \u201cCorporate America can be harsh to senior seasoned people. It\u2019s extremely difficult to have job security at this age. Finding a new job is even more challenging.\u201d\n\nBut starting a small business has become more possible than ever. \u201cChanges in the economy have led to more and more companies outsourcing services \u2014making it the perfect time for small businesses to develop,\u201d says Rivera.\n\n2. Your work history is an advantage\n\nYou\u2019ve likely accumulated an extensive base of knowledge throughout the course of your career. That\u2019s a great reason to start a business in retirement, too.\n\n\u201cRetirees have a number of advantages over younger founders, including years of experience learning on other people\u2019s money,\u201d says David Deeds, Schulze professor of entrepreneurship at the University of St. Thomas and executive editor of the EIX (Entrepreneurship and Innovation Exchange) Board. \u201cThey\u2019ve observed what works and what doesn\u2019t, which should limit costly mistakes.\u201d\n\nFor example, retired professionals know how to give presentations, work with executives and build successful teams. All of these skills are valuable as you begin a business. You\u2019ll know how to connect with customers and sell yourself \u2014 two key characteristics for successful entrepreneurs.\n\nAlso see: Turbo charging your retirement savings later in life is harder than you think\n\n3. You have established finances\n\nWhen you\u2019re starting out in your career, odds are you don\u2019t have much in savings to launch a business. But by the time you\u2019re retired, you may well have some kind of financial cushion. What\u2019s more, Deeds says, retirees \u201cgenerally have lower monthly cash needs, since they are past kids and frequently have the house paid off.\u201d\n\nThis means starting a business can be less stressful financially. With consistent income and no full-time career to maintain, you can devote the time needed to build a successful business. This also allows you to be flexible as opportunities arise and fall, which is key as an entrepreneur at any age.\n\nFor Dillon, the ability to move around and try new things has been one of the most important learnings as a retiree turned successful business owner. He says: \u201cBe flexible! And, find an area or industry that is underserved where you can add value\u2026then go for it! Don\u2019t take no for an answer. If you meet with rejection, get up, brush yourself off, and try again. There is always more than one way to skin the proverbial cat.\u201d\n\n4. You have niche experience\n\nHaving experience in a specific niche means you can go embark on a business with knowledge and insights that many young entrepreneurs don\u2019t yet have. And that can set you up for greater success.\n\nAccording to CBInsights, the top five reasons startups fail are:\n\nNo market need\n\nRan out of cash\n\nNot the right team\n\nGet outcompeted\n\nPricing/cost issues\n\nBut your specialized experience gives you a better understanding of the market, what the customer needs and what potential competitors are doing. So, you\u2019re less likely to fall prey to the common startup challenges.\n\nRead: Why working has become the new retirement\n\n5. You can revisit your passions\n\nAfter a lifetime of work in your chosen career, retirement is the perfect time to revisit your passions and turn them into a business. Just ask Nina Bandoni, of the Tampa/St. Petersburg, Fla. area.\n\nThe former chair of LIHLN (Low Income Housing Leadership Network) and City Commissioner of Safety Harbor, Fla., started the Sharing a Journey: Ageless Life & Style blog. It let her \u201cshare\u201d her midlife progress and her earlier love of fashion, \u201cwhich I have time for again!,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI started my blog with the hopes of developing it into a business that would allow me greater flexibility than a corporate nine-to-five type job,\u201d Bandoni notes. \u201cMidlife is a great time to reconnect with yourself, try new things or circle back and pick up interests left behind when family and work responsibilities are at their peak.\u201d\n\nThe joy of starting a business in retirement\n\nNot only does starting a business in retirement provide extra income, you may find it offers psychic benefits, too.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that one of the ways to be content in retirement or semi-retirement is to stay active and engaged with the world,\u201d says Dillon.", "description": "It\u2019s the ideal time to launch a part-time venture.
