Can you not see he has been injured?\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t tell me to calm down. I\u2019m not going to calm down. Your breath stinks. Who do you think you are? I will find out where you live and come for you.\u2019\n\nShe says she called nurse Helen Amanuel a \u2018daft b***h\u2019 rather than a \u2018black b***h\u2019 (Picture: Cavendish Press)\n\nSecurity staff at Manchester Royal Infirmary ejected Barret who was then arrested outside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was convicted of a racially aggravated public order offence following a trial at the city\u2019s magistrates\u2019 court.\n\nBarrett, of Broughton, Salford, who denied wrongdoing, faces up to six months in jail when she is sentenced later this month.\n\nRecalling the incident on June 24, Ms Amanuel says her team sat the defendant\u2019s brother in a chair in the corner because the beds were full of patients.\n\nBarrett, who had been celebrating her birthday, stormed over and asked why doctors had not seen to her brother yet.\n\nShe got up in the nurse\u2019s face and said she would \u2018find out where she lives\u2019 (Picture: Cavendish Press)\n\nShe said a group of men had left him with a crack on the back of his skull and a wound on his forehead.\n\nMs Amanuel said: \u2018I explained can you calm down, we have other patients that are poorly, but she got very upset.\u2019\n\nThe nurse of eight years said she took his medical history and decided it was safe for him to sit and wait.\n\nMs Amanuel added: \u2018She was waving her arms around and shouting the whole time \u2013 there were 15 other people in that room.\u2019\n\nAfter being told security would have to be called in, Barrett said: \u2018Who do you think you are? He is just sat in a chair, nobody is seeing him.\u2019\n\nThe court heard how Barrett squared up with Ms Amanuel so closely they were almost touching, before threatening to \u2018find out where she lives\u2019.\n\nThe nurse said: \u2018I was upset because I was trying to help her brother.\n\nShe told the nurse who was looking after her injured brother that her \u2018breath stinks\u2019 (Picture: Cavendish Press)\n\n\u2018This is a place where I work, I come to feel safe and help people, there was no need for that approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA colleague had put herself in between the pair as security were called to remove Barrett.\n\nMs Amanuel said: \u2018She turned around and called me a black b***h loud enough for everyone in the room to hear.\u2019\n\nShe says staff at A&E regularly take abuse from unruly patients and relatives, with some getting punched and spat at.\n\nBarrett told the court she only raised her voice \u2018because she was scared\u2019 and denied calling the nurse a \u2018black b***h\u2019 or saying her \u2018breath stinks\u2019.\n\nShe added: \u2018That is not something that would come out of my mouth.\n\n\u2018I have got black nephews and nieces I wouldn\u2019t say something like that.\n\n\u2018I shouted daft b***h, those other words did not come out of my mouth they never have and never will, I\u2019ve lived around black people all my life I\u2019m not a racist person.\u2019\n\nShe says her only priority was caring for her brother, who had been waiting for nearly 30 minutes and was covered in blood.\n\nBarrett said she was nervous because her sister suffered a miscarriage after being left by emergency staff for seven hours following a major car crash.\n\nShe added: \u2018If I was waving my arms around I was just saying check on my brother.\n\nPrimark pulls tea towel from sale because it has so many errors\n\n\u2018It would have been normal for me to react like that if my brother is slumped in a chair like that and bleeding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Maybe I would have been swearing and things but I wasn\u2019t shouting all the way through.\u2019\n\n\u2018I was worried and I was panicking I stepped out of line for a couple of minutes in the hospital and that is it.\u2019\n\nNicola Durham, prosecuting, said: \u2018The defendant turned up in a drunk, emotional state demanding attention and not getting her own way and despite the upsetting circumstances the nurse was just trying to do her job.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
