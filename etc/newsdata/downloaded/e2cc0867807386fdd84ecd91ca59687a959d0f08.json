There\u2019s a bench nearby. The kids don\u2019t have to be alone when they want to go there.\u201d\n\nJohann Neethling, Dylan\u2019s father, shot his sleeping son in the early hours of 8 September. Johann then reported a shooting to the police before lying down next to Dylan and shooting himself.\n\nJohann and Nandia had been estranged and Dylan was visiting his dad.\n\nNow Nandia finds herself in a legal battle with Johann\u2019s daughter from a previous marriage, Yulandi Aktash. It\u2019s come to light that Johann didn\u2019t leave Nandia or Dylan anything in his will.\n\nApparently Yulandi, who\u2019s the executor of the estate, is demanding that Nandia provide proof of each and every gift Johann gave her while they were married.\n\n\u201cWho keeps a record of everything their husband gives them while they\u2019re married? They also don\u2019t want to give me my child\u2019s stuff. I mean, it\u2019s things for a child \u2013 a go-cart and a quad bike.\u201d\n\nYulandi\u2019s lawyer, Candy-Lee de Sousa, has told YOU that her client doesn\u2019t wish to comment. Nandia is also being denied access to the family home in Panorama where Nandia lived for the eight years she was married to Johann.\n\n\u201cSome of my personal items are still there, as well as the dishwasher he gave me for our first anniversary and a microwave oven,\u201d says Nandia adding that Yulandi is also demanding she return the car she\u2019s been driving.\n\nNandia says Johann gave her the car but it\u2019s still registered in his name. \u201cFirst, he took my child. Now he\u2019s leaving me with nothing.\u201d\n\nYulandi got married in South Africa in January 2018 but lives in Dubai.\n\n\u201cI just want my child\u2019s things,\u201d Nandia says.\n\nIn an earlier interview she told YOU that no one knows exactly what happened the night of the shooting. \u201cWhat goes through someone\u2019s mind who does such a thing? Dylan had his whole life ahead of him.\u201d", "description": "A memorial plaque for Dylan Neethling, the boy whose dad shot him before turning the gun on himself, was put up this week at Panorama Primary in Cape Town where Dylan was a pupil.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9487/0d9afc15c2b04d0e8082f91bbface76d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
