Johnson was taken to task by a reporter from the local newspaper for his remarks on LBC radio about police forces \u201cspaffing money up the wall\u201d investigating historical child abuse allegations. \u201cIs that something you still believe in relation to historic investigations of CSE [child sexual exploitation]?\u201d the Rotherham Advertiser reporter asked.\n\nJohnson appeared to deny making the remarks, despite them being recorded and broadcast on LBC. \u201cThat\u2019s actually not what I said,\u201d he replied. \u201cAll such investigations are extremely important and the point I was making is we do need to be backing police to be fighting crime.\u201d\n\nThe National Crime Agency has more than 200 people investigating allegations of child sexual exploitation in Rotherham, making it the largest such inquiry in the UK. It had a budget last year of just under \u00a312m and is seeking to increase this as it works toward recruiting a staff of 250.\n\nJohnson was heckled during his speech by a member of the public when he said that as a former mayor he understood the power of \u201clocal, accountable leadership to sort out what matters most to local people\u201d.\n\n\u201cLike our MPs, Boris \u2026 Maybe get back to parliament \u2026 sort out the mess you created,\u201d yelled a man from the back of the hall, shortly before being ejected by security guards.\n\nJohnson was also confronted by a woman in Doncaster. \u201cPeople have died because of austerity and you\u2019ve got the cheek to come here and tell us austerity is over and it\u2019s all good now, we\u2019re going to leave the EU and everything\u2019s going to be great,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fairytale.\u201d\n\nJohnson said the north of England was poorly served by trains compared with London, and noted that it had taken him just over an hour and a half to get to Doncaster from London on Friday morning.\n\n\u201cBut if, for example, you travelled from Liverpool to Rotherham, less than half the distance, you might have had to leave an hour earlier than me and change as many as three times,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYour journey may have been on two and three-carriage trains, some of them built in the early 1980s with a body designed for a bus with bus seats too. I love buses but not when they are supposed to be trains. It\u2019s time for the north to run its own trains.\u201d\n\nJohnson promised greater control over fares, service patterns, rolling stock and stations on local lines in metropolitan areas, and opportunities for rural communities to own their own lines.\n\nMayors such as Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester have long demanded change in the way railways in their areas are managed. After the speech, Burnham said the pledge would allow him to create \u201cGM Rail\u201d to connect better with the bus and tram network in the city, as Transport for London was able to in the capital.\n\n\u201cIt is what we have been calling for, but we have got to make sure it comes with the funding that we will need and all of the powers we need,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson promised the mayors that the government would \u201cbe generous on capital spending, but we won\u2019t be able to afford everything everyone wants, so choices will have to be made\u201d.\n\nHe said they might have to raise some of their own funds, but it was unclear whether they would do this by increasing council tax or fares. Burnham repeated his call for \u201cLondon-style subsidies\u201d for rail, bus and tram passengers in the north.\n\nSteve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool city region, who already controls Merseyrail, the most punctual line in England, said he also welcomed the idea but needed to be sure the government would provide the necessary indemnification in case of major infrastructure failure.\n\n\u201cIf we had a major tunnel collapse for example, that would bankrupt the whole city region if we had to fix it,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson told the mayors: \u201cAs you have asked, we will give you far greater control over your budgets. But as well as power, you have to take responsibility. That means alongside taking the credit you will have to take the heat, just like the mayor has to do in London. No one blames the government for the problems on the Central line. They blame the mayor.\u201d", "description": "PM told to \u2018sort out the mess\u2019 as he pledges to give mayors London-style rail powers", "authors": ["Helen Pidd", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efd87b1c7a5ecb03b8028e0249e71769de2857cb/0_145_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7aeeaa4134c58a81b37edd2e797d0056", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
