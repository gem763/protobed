It made no adjustments on Wednesday.\n\nThe strong growth was seen in particular in its Nasty Gal and PrettyLittleThing divisions.\n\nThe federal government in Berlin has approved a \u20ac380m (\u00a3336m) six-month loan for German charter airline Condor, which belongs to the bankrupt Thomas Cook group.\n\nThe airline said it was now on the lookout for a new owner, who could be either a \u201cstrategic investor or a financial investor.\u201d\n\nHalf of Condor\u2019s loan was put up by the state of Hesse, where Condor is based, and the other half by the German government.\n\nEconomy minister Peter Altmaier said the government is in talks with the European Commission, which needs to approve the loan.\n\n\u201cSince our liquidity was used up by our insolvent parent company for the seasonally weaker booking period, we need this bridge financing for the winter,\u201d said Condor CEO Ralf Teckentrup.\n\n\u201cThe commitment is an important step in securing our future.\u201d\n\nThomas Cook folded on Monday, after failing to secure further bailout cash. Its collapse has put 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide, of which 9,000 are in the UK.\n\nDozens of Sainsbury\u2019s (SBRY.L) and Argos stores are to close as part of a \u00a3500m cost-cutting drive over the next five years.\n\nUp to 15 Sainsbury\u2019s supermarkets, up to 40 convenience stores and up to 70 Argos stores will be shut down under the plans.\n\nBut Sainsbury\u2019s, which bought Argos in 2016, said it also planned to open around 10 new supermarkets, 80 Argos outlets in Sainsbury\u2019s and 110 new convenience stores.\n\nThe company did not say in its latest trading update on Wednesday what the shakeup could mean for staff numbers, or which stores will be affected.\n\nThe group raised its target for debt reduction to at least \u00a3750m over three years, with plans to lower it by at least \u00a3300m in the 2019-20 financial year alone.\n\nOne of Northern Ireland\u2019s biggest employers, coach-builder Wrightbus, is expected to go into administration this week, putting 1,400 jobs at risk.\n\nThe Ballymena-based company is best known for making London\u2019s double-decker Routemaster bus, known as the \u201cBoris bus\u201d \u2014 since it was commissioned by prime minster Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London in 2007.\n\nStory continues", "description": "A daily overview of the top business, market, and economic stories to watch in the UK, Europe, and abroad.", "authors": ["Edmund Heaphy", "Finance", "News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KeQkFrNgvUpDgqoTlHWhBg--~B/aD0zNDA3O3c9NTM2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/13eafba0-df77-11e9-afff-a1d61fffafc5", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
