Some of the proposals included increased support for exports, agriculture and tourism.\n\nThe document has been met with a mixed response, with the ANC\u2019s alliance partner, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, criticising it as incoherent and unreliable.\n\nPoor implementation\n\nGovernment has in the past published several policy documents on stimulating the economy and Mboweni, a former governor of the Reserve Bank, singled out poor implementation as a major stumbling block.\n\n\"One of the biggest constraints to the economy of South Africa is lack implementation about those things that have been decided upon.\"\n\nHe said if, at some point, at least 30% of the things agreed upon were implemented, \"we would be making great progress\" - adding that this shortcoming \"speaks to the capacity and capability of the state\".\n\n\"It speaks to the failure to rally around the major economic actors to pull in the same direction.\"\n\nNo illusions\n\nSpeaking on the divergent views that greeted the strategy document, Mboweni stressed the he was under no illusion that the road ahead was going to be easy.\n\n\"The key economic actors are not moving in the same direction, they are pulling away from each other, and therefore we are not able to move decisively in the direction that we are supposed to move.\n\nSouth Africa's economy has over the past few years been stuck in a slow growth rut, with government and independent agencies constantly downgrading its growth prospects.\n\nIn September, ratings agency Moody's revised down South Africa's growth forecast for 2019 from 1% in June to 0.7%, listing slow pace in policy implementation as a major hindrance. Economic growth is expected to pick up to 1.5% in 2020.", "description": "The economic policy document released by the National Treasury in August is being finalised after receiving input from various sectors,", "authors": ["Sibongile Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9358/b55908799a4e41ca98cfcdfc07e84b2d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
