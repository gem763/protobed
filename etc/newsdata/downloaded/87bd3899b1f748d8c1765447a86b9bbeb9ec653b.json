I have two married daughters, six grandchildren and two terrific sons-in-law.\n\nA few days ago, one of my daughters was annoyed that her husband was not helping and really lit into him for not assisting with the kids fast enough. Her request was more of a tirade than plea for help.\n\nAt this stage of the game, is it ever appropriate for Dad to take a \"child\" aside and offer advice? Something like: \"Sweetheart, I am very concerned that you humiliated 'Jack' when you wanted him to get moving. Wouldn't it have been better to gently remind him that you needed help?\"\n\nOr should I just stay out knowing my comments could cause further acrimony?\n\n\u2014 J.\n\nJ.: Stay out of it knowing you don\u2019t know everything you think you know.\n\nYou saw your daughter behave badly, yes.\n\nBut unless you\u2019re in this marriage yourself, you don\u2019t know the backstory.\n\nYour daughter could be emotionally abusive, and that would warrant prompt involvement by bystanders \u2014 to let her know her behavior is not okay and to let Jack know you see this and will stand up for him. This is an especially powerful stand for an in-law to take.\n\nIt is also possible, however, that Jack routinely strands your daughter at key child-rearing moments and that the outburst you witnessed \u2014 while still wrong, almost always \u2014 could have been a one-time loss of composure over a valid, long-running complaint. Do you really want to be the dad who sided against your daughter in that conflict?\n\nIt could also be a one-off \u2014 a free-standing flip-out by an exhausted person who quickly regretted it and who poses a low risk to do it again.\n\nHumility is our best friend. It urges us to say to ourselves in these situations: \u201cI know what I witnessed, but do I know what it meant?\u201d\n\nSometimes the answer will be yes and you\u2019ll act accordingly. But asking yourself that question in this case \u2014 I hope \u2014 rewrites the script for what to say if you do draw your daughter aside:\n\n\u201cYou really lit into Jack earlier. Are you okay?\u201d\n\nSince \u201cyou\u201d in this context can mean your daughter, or her and Jack as a couple, or all of them as a family, it allows your daughter to interpret it as concern untethered to any specific assumptions \u2014 which means (no guarantees, obviously) you\u2019re less likely to escalate tension, and thus more likely to find out whether this family needs your help.\n\nDear Carolyn: When visiting friends or neighbors, there comes a time when we should go home. My spouse, however, ignores hints such as multiple glances at the host's watch.\n\nWhen I suggested a signal, it made my spouse angry. My spouse says I should simply state it's time to go home. What do you think?\n\n\u2014 We Should Go Home\n\nWe Should Go Home: I don\u2019t even know what to do with the idea of getting \u201cangry\u201d at a hint. The suggestion of a hint.\n\nBut if we\u2019re talking about someone who doesn\u2019t respond well to reason and does respond to, \u201cHey, Pookie, I think it\u2019s time for us to go home,\u201d then that\u2019s what you say.
