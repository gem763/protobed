It still has a beautiful Retina display \u2014 only now it\u2019s True Tone so it matches the color temperature of the room. There are still two USB-C / Thunderbolt ports instead of MagSafe and traditional USB-A ports. The processor is unchanged, a Y-series chip that does the job but can struggle under heavy loads. It still has Touch ID for securely logging in. And it still \u2014 yes \u2014 has a controversial and divisive butterfly keyboard to type on.\n\nThe biggest difference for most people is that Apple has cut the price down by $100, so a model with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM now costs $1,099. That\u2019s much closer to what I think this laptop should cost \u2014 and more importantly it\u2019s much closer to being the entry-level price Apple should be charging for its entry-level laptop. After all, if you want to use a Mac, you only have a few options.\n\nThe real question for this new Air is whether it can live up to the classic MacBook Air that dominated the laptop industry for over half a decade. It has the same wedge shape, about the same price, and the same name. But I\u2019m not sure it has the same pedigree. The classic MacBook Air was The Default Laptop (capitalization intended) for many people. It was the easy, obvious choice \u2014 the thing you could safely recommend to anybody.\n\nThis Air is very good, but it\u2019s not quite that.\n\nOur review of Apple MacBook Air (2019) Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Touch ID for login\n\nTrue Tone display looks great\n\nThin, classic design Bad Stuff Processor can sometimes struggle\n\nUSB-C ecosystem still a hassle\n\nCan you really trust this keyboard? Buy for $1,099.00 from Apple Buy for $1,076.99 from Walmart\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with the major changes Apple made to the MacBook Air line last year, you should definitely read that review \u2014 things are different and better now, but not radically so. What has radically changed is everybody\u2019s perception of the keyboards on Apple\u2019s MacBook line. Simply put: they\u2019re hard to fully trust, as there have been so many reliability problems.\n\nSo the main question about this MacBook Air is simply one that I can\u2019t answer after a week with the device: I just can\u2019t tell you if this keyboard will suffer from the same double press and missed press issues that have afflicted the MacBook line since 2016. But I can tell you that I really do still enjoy typing on this keyboard. I know the design has been divisive because of how shallow the key travel is and how loud it is, but this iteration is quieter than others and feels ever-so-slightly softer and less \u201cclacky.\u201d\n\nThe keyboard is covered under a four-year warranty, at least\n\nThat\u2019s because Apple finally made some more serious interventions on its keyboards. No, it hasn\u2019t completely redesigned them, but it has tweaked them yet again to improve reliability. This so-called \u201cGen 3.5\u201d keyboard has what Apple will only describe as \u201cnew materials\u201d inside the butterfly switches. Perhaps more importantly, Apple introduced an extended keyboard service program, so if something goes awry you have four years of coverage. This MacBook Air is covered under it.\n\nIf we were able to set this whole keyboard issue aside, I would be asking a different question, the one I led the review with. Is this MacBook Air good enough to become The Default Laptop? My answer is that it depends on your needs \u2014 which is just another way of saying \u201cno.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s set some context, though. I really like this laptop and think it\u2019s very good. The True Tone Retina display is beautiful and makes other screens look garishly blue by comparison. Logging in with Touch ID is really convenient (and I also prefer physical function keys to the Touch Bar). The trackpad is big, accurate, and doesn\u2019t suffer from false taps from your palms. The speakers are pretty good for a laptop of this size and class.\n\nMost of all \u2014 keyboard aside \u2014 the overall design and quality of the hardware is top-notch. There are dozens of Windows laptops in the same price range that beat this Air on any number of metrics. You can get edge-to-edge screens, log in with your face, and find faster and more powerful processors. But very few of them have the same iconic look and feel of the aluminum Air.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t problems here. The webcam is not very good and even though I\u2019ve fully acclimated to life with USB-C, I know most people haven\u2019t and will also miss MagSafe. The screen still doesn\u2019t get super bright, but a software update from earlier this year made it brighter than last year\u2019s model originally allowed at launch.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that Apple was unable to update the processor to something more powerful. It is still using a 1.6GHz dual-core \u201cY-series\u201d Intel processor, which is not nearly as powerful as the \u201cU-series\u201d processor you find on the MacBook Pro and many Windows laptops.\n\nThe processor struggles to keep up if you do too much\n\nIn my day-to-day use, that hasn\u2019t been a problem at all \u2014 but my day-to-day use involves a lot of web browsing in Safari and Chrome, Slack, Spotify or iTunes, iMessage, and Evernote. Open up all of those apps and pile on the browser tabs and you\u2019ll eventually get to the spinning pinwheel of waiting, but if you keep yourself just a little in check, you\u2019ll be fine. Photo editing can sometimes make me want to close other apps, for example.\n\nThere have been reports that this year\u2019s MacBook Air has a slower SSD than last year\u2019s. I saw slightly worse results with one benchmarking tool, but never noticed a real difference in actual use. Apple tells me that performance on this year\u2019s model in the aggregate should be the same as last year\u2019s.\n\nOne positive change is that Apple may have made some software tweaks in Mojave that cause the fans to spin up a little less often than before. Compared to last year\u2019s model, I\u2019ve heard them much less often. I am experiencing about the same battery life, just over seven hours of active use that I can stretch to a little over eight if I\u2019m careful with apps and screen brightness.\n\nIf you have that classic MagSafe MacBook Air, this laptop will be an upgrade for you in every important way. It had better be, since it is going to be the default laptop for people who want an inexpensive Mac laptop. Apple is delivering something that\u2019s up to snuff. But I started this by Germanically capitalizing \u201cThe Default Laptop,\u201d and Apple hasn\u2019t quite achieved that yet.\n\nThis MacBook Air isn\u2019t the obvious, default choice anymore. As Dan Seifert notes in his review of the new entry-level MacBook Pro, you can spend just $200 more and get a significantly better machine that\u2019s only marginally thicker. Or, as I noted above, if you\u2019re willing to go Windows, there are excellent machines that don\u2019t feel quite as throttled when it comes to performance.\n\nObviously better than the classic MacBook Air, but not the obvious purchase for everybody\n\nAll of which is to say that if you\u2019re looking to buy an Air, there are a lot of \u201cifs\u201d and \u201cdepends\u201d to think about. There\u2019s always a better version coming next year. Maybe Apple will redesign the keyboard or maybe Intel will finally deliver a better processor or maybe, well, there are a lot of maybes. That is the way of all tech purchases! You always have to balance what you\u2019re willing to spend and what you\u2019re willing to lug around in your backpack.\n\nWhat made that classic MacBook Air so special is that it cut through all those caveats for so many people and did it consistently for so many years. 2019\u2019s MacBook Air is good, but it hasn\u2019t yet earned the title of The Default Laptop.\n\nAfter all, for $200 more, you could get a MacBook Pro.", "description": "There\u2019s not a lot that\u2019s changed with 2019\u2019s iteration of the MacBook Air \u2014 it\u2019s a minor tweak on the major changes Apple introduced last year.
