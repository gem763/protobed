Usually they are taken to zoos and there they are broken down in a very cruel manner,\" he told the BBC.\n\nWidespread mining around the national park had affected water and grazing areas, Mr Chisaira said adding that it had the effect of \"driving animals away\" and requiring them to compete with other animals for water.\n\nIn August, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) approved a proposal stating that elephants from Africa should no longer be sold outside the continent - however, it is yet to be ratified.\n\nYou may also be interested in:", "description": "Up to 30 young elephants have been flown to another country, believed to be China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13FA2/production/_109362818_mediaitem109362817.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
