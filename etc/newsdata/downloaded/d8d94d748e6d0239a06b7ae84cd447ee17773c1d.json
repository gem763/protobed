He very much regrets and is very sorry for doing what he did in July.'", "description": "George King-Thompson from Oxford breached an injunction when he  climbed the building from the ground floor to near the very top in just 45 minutes in July this year.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/15/19995526-0-image-a-2_1571669651057.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
