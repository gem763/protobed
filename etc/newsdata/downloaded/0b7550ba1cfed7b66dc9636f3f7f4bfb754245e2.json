(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nObamacare premiums will become more affordable next year \u2013 despite dire predictions by Democrats that the Trump administration would destroy the insurance marketplaces.\n\nIn a marked shift from previous years, average premiums for mid-level \u201csilver\u201d plans will decrease 4 percent for 2020, while the number of plans available on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces will swell 13 percent, according to figures released this morning by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Nearly 7 in 10 people will have access to at least three marketplace plans, up from six in 10 last year (the figures don't include the 11 states running their own marketplaces instead of relying on Healthcare.gov.)\n\n\u201cPresident Trump \u2013 the president supposedly trying to sabotage this law \u2013 has been better at running it than the guy who wrote the law and that has remained the case this year,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters.\n\nThe improvements are striking, considering that Democrats have spent the last few years blasting the Trump administration for peeling away Obamacare regulations. Those actions include removing the law\u2019s penalty for lacking health coverage known as the individual mandate and allowing more insurance plans to cover fewer medical services than typically allowed under the 2010 health-care law.\n\nIt's also an irony for the president himself, who has repeatedly lambasted Obamacare as a \"disaster\" and tried fruitlessly through Congress to repeal and replace it. But Trump now says because of his administration's actions, the ACA isn't so bad after all: \"Once we got rid of the individual mandate it made it better but Obamacare doesn't work -- but it works at least adequately now. And we had that choice to make. And politically it's probably not a good thing that I did, but it's the right thing to do for a lot of people,\" he said in July.\n\nBut Democrats disagree. \u201cWorking families are paying the price for Republicans' relentless effort to sabotage their health care and drive up insurance premiums,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said last year.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination:\n\nPresident Trump has relentlessly fought to sabotage and repeal Obamacare \u2014 I will not stand for it.\n\n\n\nI will protect and build on Obamacare as president, ensuring every American has peace of mind when it comes to their health care. https://t.co/6khWa6SI78 \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 19, 2019\n\nFor years, Democrats have been charging Trump is sabotaging the marketplaces. From Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), two years ago:\n\nOnly way to truly improve #healthcare is for the Trump admin to stop sabotaging marketplaces & for GOP to finally work in a bipartisan way. \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) July 6, 2017\n\nIf Trump\u2019s top health officials were trying to actively sabotage the Obamacare marketplaces, which will be open for enrollment from Nov. 1 through Dec. 15, they don't seem to be doing a very good job of it.\n\nDuring the Obama administration and in the Trump administration\u2019s first year, the marketplaces suffered from double-digit premium increases, spikes in annual deductibles and insurer exits, leaving many customers frustrated by the lack of choice and affordability. Insurers hiked premiums an average of 32 percent from 2017 to 2018, driving away many customers who earned too much for financial assistance.\n\nBut average premiums dropped last year for the first time since Obamacare was enacted, by 1.5 percent. This year, the marketplaces look even more stable \u2013 and are even thriving in some areas. Some additional figures from HHS:\n\n\u2014Average premiums for \u201csilver\u201d plans are decreasing at least 10 percent in six states: Delaware, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Utah. They\u2019re increasing at least 10 percent in three states: Indiana, Louisiana and New Jersey.\n\n\u2014Just 12 percent of customers will have access to a single insurance issuer, down from 20 percent last year. Sixty-eight percent will have access to three or more insurance issuers, up from 58 percent.\n\n\u2014Most Healthcare.gov customers are eligible for government subsidies. But prices can still be steep for those who are ineligible. For example, a 27-year-old without subsidies will pay an average premium of $426 for a \u201cgold\u201d plan, $374 for a \u201csilver\u201d plan and $278 for a \u201cbronze\u201d plan.\n\nTrump\u2019s health officials have often faced tricky political questions about why the administration is refusing to defend the ACA in a high-profile lawsuit in which a decision is expected any day. But yesterday, they were clearly trying to take a victory lap, pushing back hard against criticisms from Democrats over how they\u2019ve handled the ACA.\n\n\u201cOur results speak for themselves,\u201d said CMS administrator Seema Verma. \u201cIt\u2019s the proof this administration\u2019s tireless work to mitigate the damage caused by Obamacare is paying off.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s been the line Azar and Verma have frequently adopted about the ACA: That they are trying to make the best of a flawed law. They told reporters they still want the law repealed \u2013 something Republicans in Congress tried and failed to do back in 2017 \u2013 but said they\u2019re \u201cfixing\u201d it in the meantime.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s actions have worked,\u201d Verma said. \u201cWithout them, Obamacare would have continued to spiral out of control.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) joined by Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nDemocrats were furious when HHS issued regulations last year opening the door wider to leaner but cheaper health plans people can buy outside the marketplaces. Short-term plans can now be purchased for a year instead of just three months, and there\u2019s broader latitude for chambers of commerce and trade associations to come together to buy coverage through association health plans.\n\nThese plans, allowed to cover fewer medical services than typical Obamacare plans, were expected to attract healthy people out of the marketplaces, leaving sicker ones behind and driving up premiums overall. The Congressional Budget Office projected their expansion would drive up premiums \u2013 but just by 3 percent.\n\nThen there was the 2017 tax overhaul, in which congressional Republicans repealed the ACA\u2019s penalty for lacking health coverage. That also fueled charges from Democrats that healthy people would abstain from buying coverage, therefore driving up marketplace premiums for everyone left behind.\n\nMarketplace enrollment has declined somewhat \u2013 falling by 300,000 people this year \u2013 but getting rid of the penalty hasn\u2019t had the catastrophic event many had predicted. Some states, including California, New Jersey and Rhode Island, have implemented their own penalties in the absence of a federal one.\n\n\u201cI think people who predicted immediate meltdowns probably overstated the case,\u201d said Joel Ario, who directed the HHS Office of Health Insurance Exchanges under Obama. \u201cBut over time, I think it will prove correct that states without mandates will have trouble keeping a stable pool.\u201d\n\nEven as Democrats\u2019 predictions haven\u2019t come true, the Trump administration may also be claiming more credit than it deserves. Marketplace insurers reached profitability after their massive rate increases in 2018, so it\u2019s possible the rates would have leveled out with or without the administration\u2019s new policies. The ACA limits how much money insurers can collect in premiums relative to their overhead costs, so more massive rate hikes would have required them to pay large rebates to customers.\n\nInsurers are also pointing to the \u201creinsurance\u201d programs the administration has approved in 12 states as another reason for why they\u2019re lowering rates. Through these reinsurance programs, states can help cover the sickest, high-cost individuals, in order to keep premiums lower for everyone in the marketplaces.\n\n\u201cWe really have seen this market stabilize over the years,\u201d said Justine Handelman, senior vice president for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, told reporters recently.\n\nYou are reading The Health 202, our must-read newsletter on health policy.

(Megan Jelinger/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAHH: Two Ohio counties reached a $260 million settlement with four drug companies hours before a landmark opioid trial was set to begin in Cleveland.\n\nThe last-minute deal made by distributors McKesson Corp., AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health and drug manufacturer Teva Pharmaceuticals, four of the defendants in case, still leaves many unanswered questions. But the deal \u201ccould help push the parties toward a wide-ranging agreement on more than 2,400 similar claims filed across the country,\u201d our Post colleagues Lenny Bernstein, Scott Higham, Sari Horwitz and Aaron C. Davis report.\n\n\u201cThe $260 million settlement, reached just hours before opening arguments were scheduled to begin in the first federal lawsuit of the opioid era, will give Cuyahoga and Summit counties badly needed cash and anti-addiction medication,\u201d they write. \u201c\u2026The Ohio deal ratchets up the pressure on plaintiffs and drug companies to reach a global settlement or, some argue, to cut their own deals sooner. If the hundreds of lawsuits filed by cities, counties, Native American tribes and others continue to be settled individually, the first jurisdictions are likely to get larger payouts, attorneys said.\u201d\n\nA case with Walgreens, which did not take part in the settlement, has been postponed, and another defendant, Henry Schein Medical, said it reached a deal to \u201cdonate $1 million to establish an educational foundation in Summit County that will develop best practices for the proper use of prescription opioids and will pay $250,000 of Summit County\u2019s legal expenses.\u201d\n\nA man uses a vape device. (Reuters/Adnan Abidi/Illustration/File Photo)\n\nOOF: A Massachusetts judge said a temporary ban on the sale of vaping products can remain in place for now, but questioned its legality and called on the state to address numerous problems.\n\nThe judge said in a 32-page order that the state has a week to rewrite the ban. It must also resubmit the plan and hold a public hearing \u201cso affected vape shops and others can weigh in, and provide a fiscal impact to businesses,\u201d USA Today\u2019s Joey Garrison reports.\n\nThe temporary ban issued by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker is the strongest such measure by a state so far in response to a national outbreak of vaping-related illnesses.\n\n\"While the plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success, the balance of harms weigh in defendants\u2019 favor in some respects, and an immediate injunction against the entire order would contravene the public interest,\" Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Douglas Wilkins wrote. \"The court therefore allows the defendants an opportunity to cure the defects identified above.\"\n\n\u2014 The House Ways and Means Committee, chaired by Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), will mark up a bipartisan bill this week that would establish a tax on nicotine used in vaping products.\n\nThe bill, introduced by Reps. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.) and Peter King (R-N.Y.), is one of a slew of health-related measures the committee will markup this week.\n\nThe markup comes as federal and local health officials and lawmakers have been sounding the alarm about vaping amid a spate of mysterious vaping-related illnesses that have sickened at least 1,479 people in cases reported in every single state but Alaska.\n\n(istock)\n\nOUCH: Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program now cover more than a million fewer children than they did before December 2017, the New York Times\u2019s Abby Goodnough and Margot Sanger-Katz report.\n\nBetween December 2017 and this past June, there was a drop of 3 percent of enrolled children, which some state and federal officials argue is a sign of an improving economy, meaning more families are getting covered through employers.\n\n\u201cBut there is growing evidence that administrative changes aimed at fighting fraud and waste \u2014 and rising fears of deportation in immigrant communities \u2014 are pushing large numbers of children out of the programs, and that many of them are now going without coverage,\u201d Abby and Margot write. \u201cThe declines are concentrated in a minority of states; in other places, public coverage has actually increased\u201d\n\nA Times analysis of census data found there were more than 400,000 children without any sort of insurance between 2016 and 2018. The states that saw marked drops in the number of insured children had more frequently established eligibility rules. Other states with a big immigrant population may have seen parents concerned about enrolling their children, who are citizens, in the federal programs because of fear of how it would impact their own chances of getting a green card.\n\nIn Texas, for example, \u201cthe number of uninsured children rose by around 120,000 between 2016 and 2018,\u201d Abby and Margot report. \u201cState officials increased paperwork requirements in 2014 for families covered under both Medicaid and CHIP, which serves children whose income is slightly higher than Medicaid\u2019s.\u201d\n\nOPIOID OPTICS\n\nRichard Davis was employed as an addiction counselor at Howard University Hospital from April through July. He and others say the District\u2019s new program to treat people who have overdosed on opioids is not well run. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\n\u2014 One of the initiatives to combat the opioid epidemic that D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) announced last year is off to a slow start. The plan sought to launch a buprenorphine program in emergency rooms across the District to reach drug users with the medication that alleviates opioid cravings in hospital ERs, where they are often found.\n\n\u201cSince it began operating in late April, the city\u2019s program \u2014 run through a contract with the D.C. Hospital Association worth nearly $2.9 million over two years \u2014 connected only a small number of patients with treatment, according to records and interviews with District officials, treatment providers and outreach workers,\u201d our Post colleague Peter Jamison reports.\n\nFewer than 30 patients have been treated in an ER with the addiction medicine in the first four months of the program. Just 19 patients continued treatment outside the hospital. Meanwhile, during those four months, nearly 600 opioid users were taken to a participating hospital in an ambulance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new initiative,\u201d said Gayle Hurt, the hospital association\u2019s assistant vice president for patient safety and quality operations. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of to be expected that not everything is going to be perfect.\u201d\n\nHEALTH ON THE HILL\n\n(iStock)\n\n\u2014 Physicians for Fair Coverage, a coalition of doctors backed by private equity firms and investment groups, poured more than $4 million into lobbying efforts between July 1 and Sept. 30 to push lawmakers to tackle surprise medical bills, the Hill\u2019s Jessie Hellman reports, citing lobbying disclosure reports.\n\n\u201cIt's a record-high amount for the relatively new coalition, which spent less than $5,000 on lobbying during the same time period last year,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe group spent $120,000 between April 1 and June 30 and $25,000 from Jan. 1 to March 31.\u201d\n\nThe Health 202 wrote last month about how doctors appeared to be gaining an edge in the legislative fight over tackling the steep medical bills that patients get when they receive care from a physician or hospital that\u2019s not covered by their insurance plan.\n\nThe group is in favor of a bill from Reps. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.) and Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) that would allow for arbitration, where an independent third party would determine a price and that also has the support of numerous fellow physicians in Congress. The group has lobbied against measures that would peg payments to an existing set of rates for in-network doctors.\n\n\u2014 And here are a few more good reads from The Post and beyond:\n\nTRUMP TEMPERATURE\n\nTrump urges quicker action to allow imported drugs from Canada U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday called on U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar ...
