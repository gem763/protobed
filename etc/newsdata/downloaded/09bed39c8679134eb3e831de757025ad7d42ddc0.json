This week: a four-day solo trip to Dubai. The total spent is at the bottom.\n\nIt has been a horrible year, fraught with family illness, heartbreak and bereavement \u2013 and as winter\u2019s grip fastened, I was desperate for escape. Maybe I was running away, but I set my sights on a minibreak in the sunniest and most optimistic place I could think of: Dubai.\n\nI lived there for two years, and whenever I return to the UAE it puts a spring in my step. The city can be hideously expensive, of course, but this wasn\u2019t your typical Dubai blow-out \u2013 I\u2019ve seen the big hitters (Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall, Downtown) more times than I care to remember. I was travelling on my own, but decided to stay at the cheaper end of town.", "description": "Join the conversation", "authors": ["Hazel Plush", "Travel Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/dubai%2520money-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
