[Photo provided to China Daily]\n\nAs far back as 2,000 years ago, Sichuan brocade, embroidery and lacquerware were sought out by people far and wide for their excellent quality and exquisite appearance. Today, the traditional skills required to make these treasures are still being passed down from generation to generation in Chengdu.\n\nDuring the seventh China Chengdu International Festival of Intangible Cultural Heritage, a large, ornately decorated black lacquer wine container, streaked with red patterning drew much attention.\n\nThe work, characterized with floral and cloud patterns, was done by Song Xiping, a national-level intangible cultural heritage inheritor of Chengdu lacquer art. It took Song seven years to finish the artwork.\n\n\"I'm 68 years old this year. I may not have as much energy in the future, so I want to make as many as I can. I hope the glory of Chengdu's lacquer art can be fully illuminated through my work,\" Song said.\n\nChengdu is one of the birthplaces of Chinese lacquer art, which rose to prominence from the Shang Dynasty (c. 16th century-11th century BC) to the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-256 BC), its technology far ahead of the rest of China for quite a long time.\n\nIn the 1970s, the unearthed relics of the Mawangdui tombs of the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220) in Changsha caused a sensation across the world. Some of the exquisite lacquerware discovered in the tombs came from Chengdu.\n\nSong began working at Chengdu lacquer factory shortly after the Chengdu-made lacquerware was unearthed in the Mawangdui tombs.\n\n\"I always remember how much I was shocked when I saw the lacquerware unearthed from the tombs,\" Song said.\n\nWhen creating some of her classic works she has been inspired by the lacquerware unearthed from the tombs.\n\nThe production of lacquerware includes more than 100 individual processes.\n\n\"I started my career at the age of 21, and I've been practicing these skills for 47 years. In the future, I want to teach more of the younger generation,\" Song said.", "description": "As far back as 2,000 years ago, Sichuan brocade, embroidery and lacquerware were sought out by people far and wide for their excellent quality and exquisite appearance.
