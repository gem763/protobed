Is this why you left early?\u2019 He says, simply.\n\nThe emotional speech that followed had many with less cold dead hearts than me in tears \u2013 a golden moment for the SWs and a classic, beautifully written Archers episode that brought out the best in everyone.\n\nElsewhere, if you will forgive the change of topic, Basil the pig still won\u2019t get it up. Toby tried to get Kate to give an erotic massage to the beast but she was furious and chucked him out \u2013 she wasn\u2019t about to massage a pig in order to get it to mate for meat.\n\nToby takes matters into his own hands and wafts an aromatherapy candle under Basil\u2019s snout to get him in the mood. In classic Fairbrother form, he drops the candle into the stye, leaving Basil traumatised and even less frisky then before, if that\u2019s possible.\n\nRex is furious \u2013 what next for Basil?\n\nPhilip and Kirsty get locked out and end up spending hours locked in with Joy, who bombards them with stories and videos of Rochelle. There needs to be some nuance to Joy at some point before she becomes too much of a caricature.\n\nmetro-tag-post-strip]\n\nIt was entertaining to introduce her as a garrulous Geordie with a penchant for butterfly buns and an obsession with her daughter, but she\u2019s at risk of becoming two-dimensional. I\u2019m sure there is more coming soon \u2013 but there is only so much we will swallow before she becomes a bore to us as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI suspect she\u2019s being built up before a big storyline \u2013 we shall have to wait and see. Meanwhile, have you seen what our Rochelle\u2018s show reel yet? You really must.\n\nThat\u2019s if for now \u2013 we have butterfly buns to bake.\n\nJoin you next week for Joe\u2019s funeral, Basil\u2019s sex drive and more.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The passing of Joe Grundy finally came.
