The years of peace - along with its rich natural resources - have made it a darling for international investors.", "description": "Ghana said police foiled a suspected coup on Friday when they arrested three people believed to have been amassing makeshift bombs, weapons and computer equipment in a plot targeting the presidency.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
