The increases were immediately unwound at the end of the year by his successor, Mario Draghi. The Fed sent shockwaves through global markets two years later when then-Chair Ben Bernanke said bond purchases may be gradually phased out.\n\nThe Finnish governor was an early backer of monetary stimulus this year to overcome a euro-area slowdown driven by uncertainties over the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit. That stance highlighted his transition from a politician who earned a reputation for advocating austerity -- he spent much of the region\u2019s crisis years the European Union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs.\n\nThe ECB ultimately agreed a rate cut and the resumption of asset purchases last month in a decision which split the Governing Council. It pledged not to end quantitative easing and start raising rates until inflation is solidly entrenched.\n\nDraghi holds his final policy meeting this week before handing over to Christine Lagarde. Both have insisted that governments also need to step up with fiscal stimulus to revive growth and inflation.\n\nFiscal Rules\n\nRehn\u2019s book largely addresses the euro zone\u2019s failures during the debt crisis, arguing that politicians should have moved quickly to stem contagion and protect more risk-prone countries. The next step should have been to reinforce bank balance sheets and capital buffers, and then to push through a controlled restructuring of Greek debt.\n\nHis recommendations for the future include a focus on financial stability, including completing the banking union; a large joint fiscal capacity and lender of last resort; broader macroprudential tools to tackle shadow banking and pay-day loan companies; more-credible fiscal rules; and stronger coordination of fiscal policies.\n\n\u201cEuropeans deserve better decisions than we were able to take during the euro crisis,\u201d Rehn said in the book. \u201cBut first they need to wake up to see why euro-zone reform is important and how it should be done.\u201d", "description": "Rehn Says ECB Rate Hikes Must Wait Amid Memories of 2011, 2013", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/redesign/images/seo/investing_300X300.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
