The algorithms prioritizes and offer automated quality checks to detect errors before they go to radiologists to review.\n\nGE Healthcare's algorithms, which run on GE Healthcare's Edison platform, were developed with UC San Francisco. If successful, the algorithms should fast track critical cases with time savings of up to 8 hours. The Edison platform includes a series of applications, smart devices and services for developers to create algorithms quickly, assimilate data and use analytics.\n\nAI and machine learning is expected to play a big role in radiology and medical imaging as algorithms speed up the review process. GE Healthcare is looking to embed AI in its imaging hardware, notably the Optima XR240amx system.\n\nRecent medical imaging and AI advances include:\n\nspecial feature Managing AI and ML in the Enterprise The AI and ML deployments are well underway, but for CXOs the biggest issue will be managing these initiatives, and figuring out where the data science team fits in and what algorithms to buy versus build.
