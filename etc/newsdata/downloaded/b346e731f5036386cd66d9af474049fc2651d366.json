She entered the facility earlier than her court-ordered date of October 25.\n\nHuffman had pleaded guilty to paying $15,000 to arrange for her daughter's SAT score to be falsified. She was also fined $30,000, must perform 250 hours of community service and spend a year on probation. She is the first parent sentenced in the scandal.\n\nAt her sentencing, a remorseful Huffman told the judge, \"I was frightened. I was stupid, and I was so wrong.\"\n\nThe actress \"is prepared to serve the term of imprisonment Judge (Indira) Talwani ordered as one part of the punishment she imposed for Ms. Huffman's actions,\" according to a statement by the TASC Group which represents Huffman as quoted by the Associated Press.\n\nActress Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli are among some 50 other parents who have been charged in the scandal. Unlike Huffman, they have not pleaded guilty.\n\nU.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling of the District of Massachusetts, the supervising prosecutor, said Loughlin should expect a tougher sentence than Huffman if she is convicted. He told a Boston TV station earlier this month, \"I don't think I'd be giving away any state secrets by saying we would probably ask for a higher sentence for her than we did for Felicity Huffman.\"", "description": "Huffman must also pay a $30,000 fine, perform 250 hours of community service and spend a year on probation.", "authors": ["Richard Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/15/ap_19256731469878_wide-d1060a6ad777b3f4df549a89a00f0d9b8148f9cd.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
