So when I had the opportunity for a staycation at the Arlo SoHo, I jumped at the chance to experience one of my favorite neighborhoods in a new way.\n\nSince 2016, Arlo has been hosting travelers in boutique hotels in both SoHo and NoMad. Known for impeccable attention to detail, and prioritization of public spaces and common areas, the Arlo brand is highly decorated. It has won several hospitality awards for both locations, as well as its Miami Beach endeavor, Nautilus.\n\nWith a new Midtown location on the way, as well as expansions planned into Washington, D.C., and Wynwood in Miami, I was excited to see if this growing brand lived up to its award-winning reputation.\n\nI stayed in a City King, which was comped for review purposes, but quick online scrolling revealed that prices vary wildly based on season and demand. In colder months, you should be able to grab a City King for as little at $134 a night, which is perfect for a low-budget getaway.\n\nHowever, when the weather warms, the Arlo SoHo becomes less budget-friendly, with prices skyrocketing into the high $200s on average, even reaching $367 per night for the lowest level room.\n\nThough, in high season, those prices are still pretty competitive for lower Manhattan, drawing a mix of all kinds of tourists who prioritize a central, stylish neighborhood over roomy quarters.\n\nKeep reading to see why I was so impressed by the Arlo SoHo.", "description": "What it lacks in room size, the micro-hotel Arlo SoHo makes up for with bustling common spaces and an unbeatable location.", "authors": ["Jen Gushue"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db09c5ecc4a0a4c4770b5c9?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
