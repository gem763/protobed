(Photo: Ross D. Franklin/AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Joe Arpaio would like you to know that Joe Arpaio is not going away.\n\nThe former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., who gained national notoriety for his tough anti-immigration policies and as an early endorser of Donald Trump, lost his election on the same day that Trump won his. That defeat was followed by a guilty verdict on contempt-of-court charges, the culmination of a lengthy investigation by the Obama administration into unconstitutional practices by Arpaio and his deputies.\n\nArpaio was pardoned by Trump in 2017 and last year mounted a run for the U.S. Senate. That faltered badly, thus providing what Michelle Cottle of the New York Times called \u201ca fitting end to the public life of a truly sadistic man.\u201d\n\nWell, not exactly.\n\nArpaio recently said he intends to again seek the office he held for 24 years, hoping to wrest it from the man who defeated him, Paul Penzone. \u201cI plan on winning,\u201d Arpaio told Yahoo News in a recent phone conversation. \u201cI am going to win.\"\n\nThat is precisely what some in Arizona fear. \u201cJoe Arpaio's decision to run for sheriff is a disaster for Republicans,\u201d wrote an Arizona Republic columnist. Former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican, gave money to Penzone, a Democrat.\n\nNone of this deters Arpaio. \u201cThere's a lot of unfinished work to get done,\u201d he said, though it is not clear how Penzone, a former Phoenix police officer, has failed to keep Maricopans safe. Some toughness must be missing. And toughness is what Arpaio always wanted to project, as when he called his Tent City jail a \u201cconcentration camp.\u201d It was a point of pride.\n\nArpaio, at least, is confident he\u2019ll win. \u201cI'm not saying it\u2019s in the bag,\u201d the former sheriff said, speaking with the assurance of a frontrunner, a six-time incumbent, a presidential kingmaker. He knows what people say about him \u2014 he makes too many denunciations of the media not to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going back to be vindictive,\u201d Arpaio said. He has punished enemies before. Maybe age has mellowed him. Probably it has not.\n\nArpaio is now 87 years old, making Trump, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden \u2014 average age of nearly 76 \u2014 look like young men. And though his voice has grown shaky, it is still full of the same guile and disputation that made him a hero to the right and a villain to much of the rest of the country.\n\nSheriff Joe Arpaio in 2012 talks about a new sign he unveiled at Tent City in the Maricopa County jail system. (Photo: Jack Kurtz/ZUMA Wire) More\n\nArpaio says he has a secret: \u201cI drink Italian olive oil,\u201d declared the son of Italian immigrants, who was raised in Massachusetts. The more you talk to Arpaio, the more you hear the locutions of Six Corners, the neighborhood in Springfield, Mass., where he grew up. It is also home to Mulberry Street, made famous by Dr. Seuss.\n\nBut there isn\u2019t much Seussian whimsy to Arpaio\u2019s worldview. Things are grim in his world, the \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d envisioned by Trump in his inaugural address long underway. His are the worries and fears of the Northeastern white working class, grafted onto the stark borderland landscape of Arizona.\n\nHe and Trump were both born on June 14, as Arpaio proudly points out. \u201cPresident Trump is my hero,\u201d he says, \u201cand I am not ashamed to say it.\u201d\n\nEven before Trump was elected, Arpaio demonstrated that immigration policies that seemed excessively harsh to many \u2014 like his infamous tent cities, where detainees baked in relentless heat, as well as immigration raids \u2014 would play well to what he calls a \u201csilent majority\u201d of voters supposedly uneasy with the nation\u2019s all-too-open borders.\n\n\u201cWhat Mr. Trump envisions, Sheriff Arpaio embodies,\u201d the New York Times editorial board wrote a month before the 2016 election.\n\nThe two also shared a singular obsession, their Moby-Dick a presumably faked birth certificate that showed Barack Obama to be a product of some nation other than the United States. Arpaio had been an early supporter of Trump\u2019s \u201cbirtherism\u201d conspiracy theory, going so far as to send Maricopa County officials to Hawaii in 2012 to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the matter.", "description": "The former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., who gained notoriety for his anti-immigration policies and as an early endorser of Donald Trump, recently said he intends to again seek the office he held for 24 years.", "authors": ["Alexander Nazaryan", "National Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oeBx04kXBTQv_zuh6aPL_A--~B/aD0yMzk5O3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/8d82e2e0-d561-11e9-9ead-cfe75491a7fb", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
