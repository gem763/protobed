They are trying to prevent Johnson from getting around the Benn Act, which compels him to request a Brexit extension if no deal is agreed with the EU by October 19.\n\nScottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry, anti-Brexit lawyer Jolyon Maugham and businessman Dale Vince had asked the court to rule whether it could use its \u201cnobile officium\u201d tool to sign a Brexit extension letter on behalf of the government.\n\nIn their ruling, the panel of three senior judges said they must wait until the government has infringed the law before granting the order sought by the petitioners, adding that at at this stage, there is no basis yet for doing so.\n\n\u201cBefore coercive measures are granted, the court must be satisfied that they are necessary \u2026 In this case, whether the Prime Minister will ever require to send a letter containing an extension request is uncertain \u2026 Until the time for sending the letter has arrived, the PM has not acted unlawfully, whatever he and his officials are reported to have said privately or in public,\u201d the ruling says.\n\nAs the government last week promised the court that Johnson would send the letter to Brussels as required by the Benn Act, the judges decided to postpone a decision to October 21 \u2014 the first working day after the Benn Act\u2019s deadline.\n\nJohnson's pledge, however, led the campaigners to hail the case as a success.\n\nMaugham said: \u201cWe have extracted from him a promise that he will comply with the law. If he breaks that promise he will face the music \u2014 including possible contempt proceedings.\n\n\"And the Courts are likely to make good any failure on his part, including signing the Benn Act letter.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated.", "description": "Judges defer ruling on whether they can request Article 50 extension in Boris Johnson\u2019s stead.", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo", "Paul Dallison", "David M.
