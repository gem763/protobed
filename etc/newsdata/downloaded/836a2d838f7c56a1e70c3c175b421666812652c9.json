She also played Margaret's mother, Elizabeth, in the movie \"The King's Speech\" for which she earned an Oscar nomination in 2011. (Photo: Sophie Mutevelian, Netflix)\n\nEccentric actress Helena Bonham Carter went to great lengths to prepare for her role as Princess Margaretin \u201cThe Crown,\u201d including consulting a psychic so she could channel the late royal.\n\nCarter, 53, told attendees at the Cheltenham Literature Festival on Saturday night she consulted a medium to connect with the late sister of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nMargaret died in 2002, and Carter is taking over the role of the rebel princess from Vanessa Kirby, who played the younger version of Princess Margaret in the show\u2019s first two seasons. When the series returns on Nov. 17, it will jump forward in time.\n\n\u201c\u2026 I asked her, \u2018Are you OK with me playing you?\u2019 \u201d Carter told the crowd, according to U.K. publications The Times and The Guardian. \u201cShe said, \u2018You\u2019re better than the other actress\u2019\u2026 that they were thinking of. They will not admit who it was. It was me and somebody else.\n\n\u201cThat made me think maybe she is here, because that is a classic Margaret thing to say. She was really good at complimenting you and putting you down at the same time.\"\n\nCarter said though the medium told her the late princess was \u201cglad\u201d Carter earned the role, the psychic had some tips to pass along.\n\n\u201cThen she said: \u2018But you\u2019re going to have to brush up and be more groomed and neater.\u2019 Then she said: \u2018Get the smoking right. I smoked in a very particular way. Remember that \u2013 this is a big note \u2013 the cigarette holder was as much a weapon for expression as it was for smoking.\u2019 \u201d\n\nCarter added she did other research for the role, including consulting with Margaret's relatives and three ladies-in-waiting.\n\nIn Season 3, Oscar winner Olivia Colman (\"The Favourite\") will assume the role of Queen Elizabeth II, played by Claire Foy during the first two seasons. Tobias Menzies (\"Outlander\") replaces Matt Smith as Prince Philip.\n\nThe series, which follows the royal family over the years, also has cast Josh O'Connor and Marion Bailey as Prince Charles and the Queen Mother, beginning in Season 3.\n\nThe Season 3 timeline precedes the relationship of Charles and Diana, who was just 20 when the two married in 1981. But in Season 4, Emma Corrin will take on the role of Lady Diana Spencer.\n\nContributing: Bill Keveney\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/07/the-crown-helena-bonham-carter-used-psychic-princess-margret/3898124002/", "description": "Eccentric actress Helena Bonham Carter prepared for her role as Princess Margret in \u201cThe Crown\" by consulting a psychic.", "authors": ["Leora Arnowitz", "Published P.M.
