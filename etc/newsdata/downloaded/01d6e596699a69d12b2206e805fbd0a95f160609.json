Half of them carried sacks weighing up to 40kg up wooden ladders, the others leaping down muddy slopes back into the cavernous maw. Their bodies and faces were the colour of ochre, stained by the iron ore in the earth they had excavated.\n\nAfter gold was discovered in one of its streams in 1979, Serra Pelada evoked the long-promised El Dorado as the world\u2019s largest open-air gold mine, employing some 50,000 diggers in appalling conditions. Today, Brazil\u2019s wildest gold rush is merely the stuff of legend, kept alive by a few happy memories, many pained regrets \u2013 and Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado\u2019s photographs.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Black and white was a risky path, but the Serra Pelada portfolio would mark a return to the grace of monochrome photography, following a tradition whose masters, from Edward Weston and Brassa\u00ef to Robert Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson, had defined in the early and mid-20th century.\n\nWhen Salgado\u2019s images reached the New York Times Magazine, something extraordinary happened: there was complete silence. \u201cIn my entire career at the New York Times,\u201d recalled photo editor Peter Howe, \u201cI never saw editors react to any set of pictures as they did to Serra Pelada.\u201d\n\nThe mine at Serra Pelada has been long closed, yet the intense drama of the gold rush leaps out of these images.\n\nYou can purchase Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado\u2019s Gold here", "description": "When Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado was finally authorised to visit Serra Pelada in September 1986, having been blocked for six years by Brazil\u2019s military authorities, he was ill-prepared to take in the extraordinary spectacle that awaited him on this remote hilltop on the edge of the Amazon rainforest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/18/09/salgado-gold-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
