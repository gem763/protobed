It\u2019s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cBy the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s financial firm scored a $1.5 billion deal with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China just days after he traveled with his father for a visit to the country in 2013. In Ukraine, Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of the Burisma energy company in 2014, earning a salary of up to $83,000 a month when his father was taking the lead on Ukraine issues in the Obama administration.", "description": "President Trump made a defense Thursday of his public and private requests for foreign governments to investigate the Bidens for corruption.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Joe-Biden-mic-2020-Gun-Safety-Forum-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
