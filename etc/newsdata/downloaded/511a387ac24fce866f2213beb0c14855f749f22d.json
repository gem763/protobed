We need to try not to concede goals and score. I think the away goals only really matter if you score again in the second leg.\u201d\n\nArsenal\u2019s Vivianne Miedema hits four in Champions League win at Slavia Prague Read more\n\nThe hosts took the lead through Janine Beckie before Corral, who scored 86 goals in 117 appearances for Levante before joining Atl\u00e9tico, ensured City face a tough return leg.\n\nThe most alluring tie of the round did not quite live up to that billing. But in Lauren Hemp, who was making her third appearance of the season after a spell out with a shoulder injury, City had the brightest player on the pitch. The 19-year-old ran Carmen Menayo and A\u00efssatou Tounkara ragged, and it was her shot that led to their goal. Hemp\u2019s low effort was saved by the Netherlands goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal but a poor clearance enabled Keira Walsh to play a ball through the middle. The pass took a deflection but ran kindly for Beckie, who powered it coolly into the roof of the net with her first touch. It was her fifth goal of the season and all have come in the Champions League.\n\nCity were ahead but Atl\u00e9tico could have punished them in the opening minutes. A free-kick from the edge of the box was swung towards goal only for Ellie Roebuck to acrobatically palm the ball away. It fell to Toni Duggan in the six-yard box but the former City forward could only direct the follow-up over the bar. Rather than spurring the visiting side on though, it would be their only real chance of the half, with City dominating possession and whipping the ball around. The England right-back Demi Stokes returned to the starting lineup for City and combined smartly with Hemp, with shades of the Lucy Bronze and Nikita Parris partnership to their link-up play and Jill Scott characteristically supporting the flank play from inside.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Janine Beckie scores Manchester City\u2019s opener. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nAt half-time Cushing would have been significantly happier with his team\u2019s relaxed but assured performance compared with their showing against the La Liga champions here last year. In the round of 32 a valuable away goal in Madrid, tempered by Kenti Robles\u2019s 89th-minute leveller, was thrown away within four minutes in Manchester. Atl\u00e9tico then doubled their lead and City found no way back.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r needs more time and respect at Manchester United Read more\n\nThis time round they were facing a very different Atl\u00e9tico side, one that was turned over 6-1 by Barcelona in their second game of the season and with a new manager, Pablo L\u00f3pez.\n\n\u201cIt was tough. We knew it would be difficult,\u201d said Duggan, whose attitude was praised by L\u00f3pez as \u201cextraordinary\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe lost our coach which is always difficult. We had a tough game on Saturday then had to travel here. I am so proud of the team. It means so much to us.\n\nEngland Women poised for attendance record after Wembley sell-out Read more\n\n\u201cThe performance we put in, the injuries we have got, the week we have had, it was a positive performance from us all. We haven\u2019t seen the best from Atl\u00e9tico but we are near the top of the table and competing in the Champions League.\u201d\n\nCity too are a very different side. Further into the season they are fitter and fresher than against Atl\u00e9tico last year. But it was the Spanish side who pushed for an equaliser on the break in the second half.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nStruggling to break through City\u2019s commanding backline, which had conceded only once in seven games, Maria Santos tried to catch Roebuck out from distance but could only loop the ball over the bar.\n\nHemp should have doubled City\u2019s lead after a burst into the box from the left but Laia Aleixandri threw her body in the way. In the end the hosts were punished.\n\nLudmila Silva surged down the right, shoulder to shoulder with Stokes, and having got the better of the full-back passed into the middle for Corral to poke in the late equaliser. City now have a testing run, with away trips to Manchester United, Arsenal and Madrid. \u201cI never think we won\u2019t get a goal so we are just looking forward to that game now,\u201d said Scott. \u201cI\u2019d rather play Arsenal every week. These are the games that I was like an excited kid waiting for. These runs excite the team.\u201d", "description": "Manchester City failed to capitalise on Janine Beckie\u2019s goal and despite numerous chances drew 1-1 at home to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the first leg of their Women\u2019s Champions League tie", "authors": ["Suzanne Wrack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20ab068ffa7f613fd1e1f00855425f83cf09ae20/0_129_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d22565030eda269f78e328de416e7c01", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
