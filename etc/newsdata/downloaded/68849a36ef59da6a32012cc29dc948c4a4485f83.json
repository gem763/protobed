Social media is full of this kind of thing \u2013 quizzes telling us who we are to make us feel special, harvest personal data, or provide endless clicks to some nonsense spam website. I approach them with the cynicism synonymous with all Ravenclaws.\n\nI was found to be an INFJ-T. It\u2019s super rare \u2013 less than one per cent of the population \u2013 making me probably the most special person on earth, or maybe some kind of god, come to think of it.\n\nBut I was struck by one thing (well, two things, if you also count me having the same personality type as Hitler and Osama Bin Laden; though I\u2019m not sure how they completed the test in 1943, nor in the caves of the Tora Bora). I scored 94 per cent introvert, and only six per cent extrovert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the face of it, this doesn\u2019t quite fit with my career. I\u2019m sure a lot of people from school remember me as mouthy, confident, and even dominating in class.\n\nPeople often (wrongly) think comedians are brave for standing up in front of strangers, but this result made me wonder if, for me, being a comedian is more a reaction to a fear of being in crowds than a desperation to be in front of them.\n\nI often find being in audiences a claustrophobic, anxious experience. I don\u2019t like loud places, busy rooms or lots of people talking at once. I can\u2019t block out noise, my brain cannot function if music is too loud, and I have bizarre nightmare fantasies that my body will somehow betray me.\n\nWhat if, after 37 years of relative control, I suddenly drown out The Book Of Mormon with 1,000 farts of infinite volume?\n\nWhy then stand on stage in front of hundreds of people (or 71, if you were at the Exmouth date)? Well, in a theatre, the stage is the only place you can be alone.\n\nIt\u2019s the one place you can control what is said, when and at what volume. In the event someone is making too much noise, I have permission to tell them off. I can even have them thrown out if I want! Imagine how glorious life would be if we could do this wherever we went \u2013 trains, pubs, restaurants, Christmas dinner.\n\nI find myself fantasising about living in the toilet cubicle I\u2019ve taken refuge in, wondering if there are still anchorites who wall themselves into monasteries.\n\nOffstage, the life of a comedian is also suited to the introvert. Were I to place an ad in a paper to hire one, it would read, \u2018Must like own company, thoughts, unsociable hours and eating from petrol stations\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am 15 or so dates into a 42 date tour of my new stand-up show Hot Shame, and if I found the silence and solitude (and drab furnishings, malfunctioning vending machines, bleak locations and handwash that dispenses like spat acid) of budget hotels in any way depressing, this job would be impossible.\n\nOne of my favourite things when I arrive at one on the outskirts of a town, two hours before I need to be anywhere, is to place a do not disturb sign on the door then sit and stare at the wall for an hour.\n\nThe silence recharges me somehow, anonymous corridors leading to anonymous rooms, the complete absence of anything dilutes the noise of life, of people.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t like people. People have done amazing things \u2013 inventing the suspension bridge, the trampoline, the pint glass to name but three. Many of my best times have been spent with between one and six people.\n\nMore than that, and I find myself fantasising about living in the toilet cubicle I\u2019ve taken refuge in, wondering if there are still anchorites who wall themselves into monasteries \u2013 and if so, what\u2019s the pay like?\n\nHowever, my desire for solitude and silence cannot be allowed to run amok. Left to my own devices, I would increasingly deny myself a great deal of things I enjoy \u2013 music, meeting friends, family, holidays, the city at night.\n\nAnd living in my own head, taking time to warm up in company, or preferring the quietest, most peaceful location for dinner can easily slip into rudeness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Pitcher and Piano is my idea of purgatory, but, as I remind myself: it\u2019s not your stag do, John, so wind your neck in and whack a smile on your dial. I may be in need of a classic wall-stare, but the person trying to talk to me and getting monosyllabic replies doesn\u2019t know that. Too often, in my quest for space, I lose sight of my love of politeness.\n\nWhere I live is a \u2018Good morning!\u2019 to strangers kind of place, but my commitment to being polite crashes head on with my fear of going out on a conversational limb and being left hanging.\n\nThis results in my making the most bizarre array of noises and grunts. \u2018Good morning\u2019 would be too risky, but silence too cold, so instead I end up going, \u2018Heym\u2019 (hello), \u2018Moyn\u2019 (morning), or \u2018Nyup\u2019 (absolutely no idea).\n\nI walk away thinking, \u2018What the hell was that?\u2019. It\u2019s like when you know the right words in a foreign language, but are too self-conscious to put your back into the pronunciation, so you end up sounding weirder than if you\u2019d entered the boulangerie and let fly with \u2018Bonjourno! Je Voudrais un tarte de la Citronnnneeeee\u2019.\n\nPeople appreciate the effort, so I\u2019m going to try harder from now on, push myself out of my comfort zone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust not quite yet.\n\nI\u2019ve got another 87 minutes until I need to check out of my hotel, and this wall has some quality staring left in it.\n\nMORE: How I survive Edinburgh Fringe\n\nMORE: There\u2019s no rush quite like being told to \u2018f*** off\u2019 while on national radio\n\nMORE: I\u2019m an introvert and no, I don\u2019t wish I was an extrovert", "description": "John Robins writes for Metro.co.uk about why his introverted personality makes him an ideal stand-up comedian.", "authors": ["John Robins"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-149660317_1570524112.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
