Federal Reserve officials have moved to address those repo problems, and have indicated they\u2019re open to resuming bond purchases to address the technical issue of insufficient bank reserves.\n\n\u201cThat will take some time to catch up\u201d with the financial system\u2019s needs, however, according to Emons. \u201cThat may alleviate at some point a bit the funding pressures that we see, but it will not be by year-end. It will be more by the second quarter of next year.\u201d\n\nAnd while that strain remains on financial markets, investors will at the same time need to cope with any deepening in trade tensions, the former Pacific Investment Management Co. portfolio manager said.\n\nThe U.S. is scheduled to enact further tariff hikes on Chinese goods on Oct. 15 and again Dec. 15. That raises the stakes for the high-level talks scheduled in Washington later this week. Geopolitical concerns, including around Hong Kong, are also a worry, Emons said.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) & Co. analysis has also suggested that further market pain may be in store. John Normand, the bank\u2019s head of cross-asset fundamental strategy, said a range of indicators, including investment positioning, suggested a \u201cmoderate\u201d correction.", "description": "A Repeat of\u00a02018\u2019s Rout Is Likely\u00a0Coming, Veteran Investor Says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picbe2ca2d2fd1bf65300982698a70272c9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
