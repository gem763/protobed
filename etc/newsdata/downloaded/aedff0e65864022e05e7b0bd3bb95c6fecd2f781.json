Last week, I wrote here about a U.S. District Court nominee who received a \u201cnot qualified\u201d ABA rating. Well, now it\u2019s a U.S. Court of Appeals nominee, Lawrence Van Dyke, receiving the same rating. And it means no more than it did before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one has ever accused the ABA of being conservative, or even Republican. In fact, since the 1970s, the ABA House of Delegates has passed hundreds of resolutions on all the hot political topics, all of them taking a liberal position. That\u2019s probably not a coincidence.\n\nSo it\u2019s reasonable to ask whether this consistently liberal organization can really be objective and non-political in its ratings of judicial nominees. The ABA, of course, would say, well, of course. That\u2019s a little odd when liberals are constantly telling us that, when confirmed, those same nominees will be unable to put aside their personal views or politics and impartially decide cases.\n\nWe actually do have evidence suggesting an answer to whether ABA ratings are biased. The answer is yes. In fact, at least four studies (here, here, here, and here) over the last two decades show a systematic bias against\u2026\u2026\u2026..drum roll\u2026\u2026\u2026Republican nominees. These studies cover different periods and groups of judges, and use different methods, but all come to the same conclusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis time, it seems, the academics back the people using their common sense. A liberal group favors liberal judicial nominees. And if you want to know more about VanDyke\u2019s legal experience, see here, and what those who really know are saying, see here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut take a step back and ask whether any of this really matters. Even if the ABA were not a liberal interest group, even if its ratings were not biased against GOP nominees, do its ratings make any difference?\n\nThat doesn\u2019t look good for the ABA either.\n\nThe Senate, for example, has confirmed more than a dozen judicial nominees, of both parties, rated \u201cnot qualified\u201d by the ABA, most of them without any opposition at all. Just last year, the Senate confirmed Holly Teeter to the U.S. District Court in Kansas after she received the same rating as Walker and VanDyke. Not only was there no opposition, but the Senate did not even bother to take a recorded vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other side of the coin is that, truth be told, Senate Democrats really don\u2019t care what a nominee\u2019s rating is. If President Donald Trump made the nomination, Democrats are voting NO. This year alone, the Senate has confirmed 13 nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The nine receiving a \u201cwell qualified\u201d ABA rating received an average of 42 negative votes.\n\nThe ABA\u2019s ratings are biased and, in the end, no one really cares.", "description": "It\u2019s reasonable to ask whether the ABA can really be objective and non-political in its ratings of judicial nominees.", "authors": ["Thomas Jipping", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
