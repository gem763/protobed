It\u2019s serious,\u201d he told Delaware Sen. Chris Coons on Wednesday. \u201cBut the vice president now according to reporting seems to be engaged in the same thing Trump was engaged in which is basically shaking down a foreign leader to get dirt on a political candidate, the candidate you\u2019re supporting, Joe Biden. Shouldn\u2019t he be the subject of an impeachment inquiry as well at this point?\u201d\n\nSimilar statements were made with Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\n\u201cI realize he\u2019s got William Barr, the attorney general in cahoots with him. He\u2019s got secretary of state, Pompeo, in cahoots with him,\u201d he told the California Democrat. \u201cNow, he\u2019s got the vice president dragged into this cabal. They all working together to get dirt on one of the presidential candidates, Biden. It seems like it\u2019s all now to the nasty business of oppo research run by the president with these guys, men, behind him. They\u2019re not just sycophants like Lindsey Graham. They\u2019re in it. What do you make of it?\u201d\n\nThe media watchdog NewsBusters noted that Mr. Coons seemed \u201cconfused\u201d by the size of the host\u2019s impeachment dragnet.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important we focus on the facts,\u201d the Democrat said in reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call, which was made public to counter claims by a CIA whistleblower.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that [Joe] Biden stopped the prosecution [into Burisma Holdings] and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,\u201d Mr. Trump said during the call. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. See if you can look into it\u2026it sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking the facts,\u201d Mr. Matthews insisted. \u201cHe\u2019s got secretary of state, Pompeo, in cahoots with him. Now, he\u2019s got the vice president dragged into this cabal.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division concluded that President Trump did not violate campaign finance laws during his call with Mr. Zelensky.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
