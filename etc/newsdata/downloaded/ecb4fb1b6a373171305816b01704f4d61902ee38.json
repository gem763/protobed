After a brief struggle the protestor was pulled to the platform, where he was swallowed by a crowd of people shoving and shouting before a member of the Tube staff intervened to restore order.\n\n\u201cThe crowd became hostile very quickly due to wanting to go to work. I sympathize with the aims of Extinction Rebellion but this was an own goal,\u201d said Turan Basri, 57, an environmental health manager, who witnessed the incident.\n\n\u201cCanning Town is a very working class area. Seeing what they perceived to be middle-class protesters preventing working class people from earning a living didn\u2019t go down well,\u201d Basri said.\n\nBritish Transport Police said four arrests were made at Stratford and Canning Town stations, while specialist teams were working to remove four other protesters at Shadwell Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station.\n\nThe London mayor, police and commuters condemned Extinction Rebellion for snarling public transport.\n\n\u201cThis illegal action is extremely dangerous, counterproductive and is causing unacceptable disruption to Londoners who use public transport to get to work,\u201d said Mayor Sadiq Khan. \u201cIt is also an unfair burden on our already overstretched police officers.\u201d\n\nRising to prominence in April when it occupied four sites in London for 11 days, the year-old Extinction Rebellion group wants governments to hand power to \u201cCitizens Assemblies\u201d to agree economic and social changes to tackle climate change.\n\nCritics say the movement is proposing what amounts to the overthrow of the existing order without any clear idea of what would follow, and that the world still needs fossil fuels.\n\nPeople look at Extinction Rebellion protesters glued onto the train at the Shadwell DLR station in London, Britain in this still image obtained from social media video dated October 17, 2019. TWITTER @MAXIMUS3005/via REUTERS\n\nIn an attempt to stop the disruption, police in London ordered a halt to all of the group\u2019s protests on Monday, but Extinction Rebellion activists have widely flouted the ban.\n\nPolice said on Wednesday 1,642 people had been arrested after action targeting the Treasury building, companies such as Google, financial institutions also including Barclays and asset manager BlackRock, and City Airport.\n\nExtinction Rebellion says more than 1,400 of its supporters have also been arrested in 20 cities around the world since Oct. 7, including in New York, Brussels, Melbourne and Toronto.", "description": "Climate-change activists disrupted rail services in London on Thursday, sparking a clash between angry commuters and a protester who had climbed onto the roof of a London Underground train during rush hour.", "authors": ["Paul Sandle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441843265&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0WK", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
