We\u2019re trying but lacking in that composure and that organiser there.\"", "description": "Man Utd players were warned by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to be wary of the counter-attack before Matty Longstaff hit them on the break", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20528136.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League-St-James-Park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
