Nepal is home to around 20,000 exiled Tibetans, but under pressure from Beijing the current communist government has taken an increasingly hardline stance on their activities.\n\nNepalese Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli told Xi that his country, which borders Tibet, would \"never allow any forces to use Nepalese territory for anti-China separatist activities\", according to the foreign ministry statement.\n\nYet another source of tension is US criticism of Beijing's security crackdown in the northwest region of Xinjiang, where more than one million mostly Muslim minorities are believed to be held in internment camps.\n\nChina defends the camps as \"vocational education centres\" aimed at combating separatism and religious extremism.", "description": "President Xi Jinping has warned that any attempts to split China would result in \"bodies smashed and bones ground to powder\", amid four months of anti-Beijing unrest in Hong Kong.
