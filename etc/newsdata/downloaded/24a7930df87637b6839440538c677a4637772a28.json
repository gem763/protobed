But not the videos strewn across its site, unless they were directly uploaded to that Girls Do Porn page.\n\nIt makes you wonder what, if anything, will be enough to convince Pornhub and its porn owner MindGeek to proactively get rid of Girls Do Porn\u2019s worrying content, seeing how the simplest searches for Girls Do Porn videos on Pornhub turn up plenty of Girls Do Porn videos that aren\u2019t even trying to hide. They\u2019re on YouPorn too, for that matter \u2014 another brand owned by MindGeek.\n\nYou might notice that every link in this story is to a Motherboard post, and that\u2019s intentional. Motherboard\u2019s Samantha Cole is doing a killer job reporting out this story, and you should go read it.", "description": "MindGeek\u2019s flagship porn site appears to have finally parted ways with Girls Do Porn, removing its official channel three days after its owners were charged with sex trafficking crimes in federal court.", "authors": ["Sean Hollister", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eIw82d4sD3eIqdnakEPSRwKPkoU=/0x231:4632x2656/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19287277/909929558.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
