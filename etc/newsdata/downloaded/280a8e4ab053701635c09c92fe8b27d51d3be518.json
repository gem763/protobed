Le Drian made no mention of the UK. He said: \u201cThe symptoms of a true wilding of the world accumulates, putting in peril the multilateral edifice which we collectively developed, as we learned the lessons of two great world wars.\u201d\n\nThe aim he said \u201cwas to give a voice to the immense majority of countries that believe in the efficiency of international cooperation\u201d.\n\nCalling the alliance an ambitious humanist project for the 21st century designed \u201cto fight those that are destroying the international order\u201d, Le Drian said the multilateral structures built after the second world war did not threaten national sovereignty.\n\nInstead, he said such structures were \u201ca collective guarantee and protection against the law of the strongest, including basic humanitarian law that protects civilians in time of war. Multilateralism is both a method and a goal. In a word multilateralism is humanism.\u201d\n\nConfirming the British ministerial absence from the launch on Thursday, a French government spokesman said the alliance was never intended to be a membership group with formal participation but instead an organisation for cooperation.\n\nHe said the UK supported one of the six initiatives, which are headed: call for trust and security in cyberspace, international partnership for information and democracy, joint position of the group of friends on climate and security, education; equality at the centre initiative and finally, 11 principles on lethal autonomous weapons systems.\n\nThe move came in the wake of the US president cutting funding for the United Nations, withdrawing from the UN human rights council, Unesco and the Paris climate agreement.\n\nLe Drian and Maas stressed their initiative was not directed against the US, and Maas added that he would be happy to see the US join the effort.\n\nMaas claimed multilateralism was under threat, adding that \u201call of those who want to join such an initiative [should] also declare themselves to be multilateralists. In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\u2019re on.\n\n\u201cWhoever wants to join us can join us \u2013 it is against nobody,\u201d said Mass.\n\nCritics on the left claim the plan is in fact primarily in France and Germany\u2019s national interests since they are the great beneficiaries of the status quo, and so are reluctant to reform institutions to allow currently marginalised nations a greater stake. Others have criticised the plan for being too vague, or duplicatory of the UN\u2019s work.", "description": "UK decision not to send minister to meeting is sign of how Brexit is shifting foreign policy", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour", "Martin Kettle", "Oliver Miles"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/234caad445c21daf82efebf03e67c323f3f7d740/0_143_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9d4b2dd33f44f62280ed6a512b6ab6a4", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
