Jail officials say it\u2019s partly a safety issue, including because too many books could be used to start fires.\n\nOne-time inmate Gregory Koger brought the lawsuit. His lawyers, Mark Weinberg and Adele Nicholas, say they\u2019ll appeal.\n\nWeinberg told the Law Bulletin that access to books is vital to inmates \u201csince reading is one of the few ways people behind bars can escape their drudgery.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A federal judge in Chicago has ruled the confiscation by Cook County Jail guards of over 30 books from an inmate didn't violate his free-speech rights.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
