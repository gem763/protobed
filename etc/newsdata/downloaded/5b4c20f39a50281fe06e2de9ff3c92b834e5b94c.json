REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo\n\nSAP, which makes financial management and human resources software for large businesses, is targeting large, state-owned enterprises in China as customers despite the ongoing trade war between the United States and China, McDermott told Reuters.\n\nSome of SAP\u2019s U.S.-based rivals, such as Microsoft Corp, have been barred from doing business with Chinese firms such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. Other American firms such as Cisco Systems Inc say Chinese state-owned firms will no longer allow them to bid on contracts because of trade tensions.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Germany has excellent relations at the public and the private-sector level in China, it\u2019s no question it\u2019s a help to us,\u201d McDermott said in an interview in San Francisco on Sept. 6.\n\nSAP, with a market capitalization of $131.3 billion euros ($145 billion), does not disclose its revenues from China. But the company does face trade war risks because if enough of a software product\u2019s content comes from the United States, export restrictions can apply.\n\nSAP spent more than $10 billion last year acquiring two American software firms, Callidus Software and Qualtrics. But McDermott, the first American chief of the German firm, said SAP has made no changes to where it makes its software in response to trade tensions.\n\n\u201cIf you have more than 25% of U.S.-driven innovation in the software, we comply with the same rules as a U.S. company,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many solutions that we have where that isn\u2019t the case. We haven\u2019t foundationally changed our development process in anticipation of a no-deal between China and the U.S., yet.\u201d\n\nUNEVEN MARGIN GROWTH\n\nAfter a spate of acquisitions in recent years, SAP has gone into cost-cutting mode, implementing layoffs earlier this year and committing to a goal of boosting operating margins by 500 basis points over the next five years.\n\nMcDermott told Reuters that the progress could be uneven because it will take time for job cuts made this year to take effect.\n\n\u201cYou get the bigger leverage when you get into year two and beyond,\u201d he said.\n\nActivist hedge fund investor Elliot Management Corp also took a stake in SAP earlier this year, which analysts believe has put pressure on the company to announce a share repurchase program at a capital markets day in November.\n\nMcDermott said SAP has not yet determined how large - or even whether - a share repurchase will be announced, because the company\u2019s leaders are still gathering information to present to its supervisory board, which includes worker representatives and must approve major decisions.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t made a decision on quantity, or whether it\u2019s zero, or it\u2019s something in a range, because we haven\u2019t even presented yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are taking a very diligent look at it.\u201d", "description": "German business software company SAP SE has an edge over its U.S. rivals because it faces potentially fewer restrictions on doing business with China, Chief Executive Bill McDermott said in an interview.", "authors": ["Stephen Nellis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428155770&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8903U", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
