There is nothing scarier than forgetting your loved ones. That is what happened with a man whose wife suffered memory loss after she had a stroke during the birth of their child.\n\nHowever, her husband did not give up on her and turned their love story into a book. Steve Curto wrote a book dedicated to his wife, Camre, on the occasion of their fourth marriage anniversary, in order to remind her of their lives together.\n\nThe book is titled But I Know I Love You, and not only is the story to tell people about their lives, but also to remind his wife, Camre, of their lives before their child came into this world.\n\nSteve Curto\n\nShe had a stroke during childbirth and was put into a medically induced coma and when she woke up she had forgotten everything - including the fact that she had given birth to Gavin.\n\nDon't Miss 13.8 K SHARES 4.2 K SHARES 4.7 K SHARES 4.2 K SHARES 4.3 K SHARES\n\nEven though the 38-year-old does not remember anything, she is still living with her husband.\n\n\"We were sitting on the couch and she told me, 'I don\u2019t who you are but I know I love you'.

She didn\u2019t know who I was or who her parents were.\"\n\n\"I basically lived at the hospital. They want the child to bond with the mum after birth but Camre wasn\u2019t able to bet there, so I did skin-to-skin with him and did all the feedings.\"\n\nSeven years after it all, Camre has started remembering her husband and son. She has been trying to develop her memory by writing things down and doing that again and again.\n\nThis is the power of love.", "description": "There is nothing worse than having someone close to you, forget you.
