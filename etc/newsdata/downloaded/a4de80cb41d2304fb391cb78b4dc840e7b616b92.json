The president also claimed lawyers may have stymied his efforts to bring them together.\n\nBut a spokesman for Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles blamed Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Richard O\u2019Brien, for the failed stunt and called him a \u201cnincompoop\u201d.\n\nThe recriminations broke out after Trump on Tuesday invited the grieving parents to a meeting at the White House and, in what the family described as a bombshell, revealed that the woman involved in the crash, Anne Sacoolas, was waiting in the room next door to meet them and personally apologise. They said Trump pressed them two or three times to go ahead with the \u201chealing meeting\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles speak to the media in New York.

They said any meeting would need to be prearranged with therapists present.\n\nSacoolas fled from the UK days after the 27 August accident, claiming diplomatic immunity on the basis that her American husband, Jonathan, worked at RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. The presence of O\u2019Brien at the White House meeting underlines his background in intelligence.\n\nReferring to the Dunn family not wanting to meet Sacoolas at the White House, Trump said: \u201cShe was in the room right out there, we met right here. I offered to bring the person in question in and they weren\u2019t ready for it. I spoke with Boris, he asked me if I\u2019d do that, and I did it. Unfortunately they wanted to meet with her and unfortunately when we had everybody together they decided not to meet. Perhaps they had lawyers involved by that time, I don\u2019t know exactly.\u201d\n\nHe described the meeting as beautiful and sad, and said Dunn\u2019s parents were \u201clovely, desperately sad people\u201d.\n\nOn Wednesday a Downing Street spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister and president spoke last Wednesday. The prime minister asked the president to do all he could to help resolve this tragic issue. The president agreed to work on trying to find a way forward.\u201d\n\nA family spokesman, Radd Seiger, said O\u2019Brien told Charles and Dunn during the meeting that Sacoolas was \u201cnever coming back\u201d to the UK. He said O\u2019Brien \u201cappeared to be extremely uptight and aggressive and did not come across at all well in this meeting, which required careful handling and sensitivity\u201d.\n\nMark Stephens, the family\u2019s legal adviser, said: \u201cHaving ice in your veins is a very good characteristic for being a spy but thinking you can treat human beings in that way, you would have to be a nincompoop.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s piled additional grief and hurt on the Dunn family that was entirely unnecessary. He started it by causing her to be a fugitive from justice, spiriting her out of the country on US Air Force transport without telling the Northamptonshire police.\u201d He also said press has been lined up by Trump to see the two families meeting.\n\nCharles said: \u201cWe\u2019ve said all along that we are willing to meet her. We are still willing to meet her. But it needs to be on UK soil and with therapists and mediators. And that\u2019s not just for us. That\u2019s for her as well.\u201d\n\nA statement issued by Sacoolas\u2019s lawyer Amy Jeffress said: \u201cWe are trying to handle the matter privately and look forward to hearing from the family or their representatives. Anne accepted the invitation to the White House with the hope that the family would meet and was disappointed.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear whether Sacoolas is acting freely in refusing to return to the UK or instead is acting on the orders of US intelligence.\n\nNorthamptonshire police said they would soon submit a case file on the crash to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision.\n\nIf Sacoolas is charged with causing death by careless driving or the more serious charge of causing death by dangerous driving, the force could issue an extradition request or an Interpol red notice. Sacoolas has admitted she was driving on the wrong side of the road when the accident occurred.\n\nThe family also has the option of bringing a civil case against Sacoolas. Stephens said: \u201cIt is often not understood that diplomatic immunity only applies in the host country, so the UK, not in the home country. It evaporates the moment you set foot on US soil.\u201d", "description": "President also claims lawyers may have hindered his effort to introduce parents to suspect", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour", "Barbara Ellen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eb20675e6fd1066bacef891b287a92261e5849f/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9dc96bdeba2d301b46b3a703c3af45e7", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
