The chairmen of the House intelligence, foreign affairs and oversight committees wrote to White House counsel Pat Cipollone last week demanding all documents that reference the allegations against Biden\u2019s son, as well as the transcript of a July 25 call between Trump and Zelenskiy.\n\nA Ukrainian readout of the call suggests Trump indicated Ukraine that could improve its image in part by completing the \u201cinvestigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.\u201d\n\nThe House investigation and Giuliani\u2019s comments take on added significance in light of new reports in the New York Times and the Washington Post that suggest a whistleblower complaint about Trump, filed on August 12 by a member of the intelligence community, centers on Ukraine.\n\nAn intelligence community watchdog deemed the complaint credible and \u201curgent,\u201d a designation that typically triggers an automatic referral to Congress. But the nation\u2019s top intelligence official, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, intervened to prevent it from reaching the Capitol, instead referring it to the Justice Department, which determined that the matter was privileged.\n\nLawmakers say they haven\u2019t learned the substance of the whistleblower complaint and can\u2019t confirm whether media reports about it are accurate. But Democrats on the House intelligence committee are sounding the alarm, claiming that the effort to prevent Congress from accessing the whistleblower\u2019s account appears to be an effort to shield high-level wrongdoing by the president or his top advisers.\n\nGiuliani has for months encouraged Ukrainians to advance investigations into whether Biden\u2019s diplomatic work with Ukraine intersected with his son\u2019s role in a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. He has also sought an investigation into whether Ukrainian officials worked to harm Trump\u2019s 2016 election bid.\n\n\u201cIn the course of investigating that, I found out this incredible story about Joe Biden, that he bribed the president of the Ukraine in order to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,\u201d Giuliani said on CNN on Thursday. \u201cThat is an astounding scandal of major proportions which all of you have covered up for about five or six months.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have noted that within days of Trump\u2019s call to Zelenskiy, Giuliani met one of the Ukrainian president\u2019s aides in Spain, a meeting that the State Department later said had been facilitated by the American ambassador to Ukraine, Kurt Volker. Around the same time, POLITICO reported that Trump held up a $250 million package of military aid to Ukraine, meant to shore up the country\u2019s defenses against neighboring Russia.\n\n\u201cIf the President is trying to pressure Ukraine into choosing between defending itself from Russian aggression without U.S. assistance or leveraging its judicial system to serve the ends of the Trump campaign, this would represent a staggering abuse of power, a boon to Moscow, and a betrayal of the public trust,\u201d the three committee chairmen, Representatives Adam Schiff, Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel, wrote.\n\nAfter Giuliani\u2019s interview, Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) recounted a recent meeting with Zelenskiy in which he characterized the Ukrainian leader as very attuned to Giuliani\u2019s demands and Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine\u2019s military aid.\n\n\u201cI told him it was best to ignore requests from Trump\u2019s campaign operatives. He agreed,\u201d Murphy said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what is in the whistleblower complaint,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut it was clear to me that Ukraine officials were worried about the consequences of ignoring Giuliani\u2019s demands. And of course they were. That\u2019s why presidents shouldn\u2019t have their campaigns talking to foreign leaders.\u201d", "description": "Trump\u2019s personal lawyer makes admission in TV interview.", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney", "John F.
