These portrayals are tied to a lack of women working as directors, writers and producers, and in other behind-the-camera roles, the researchers argued.\n\nThe study, called \u201cRewrite Her Story,\u201d is a collaboration between British-based humanitarian organization Plan International and the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, founded by the actor Geena Davis, who has long advocated for more equitable representation of women on-screen.\n\nThe researchers reached their findings through technology called the Geena Davis Inclusion Quotient, a tool that uses facial and voice detection software to analyze female representation in movies and TV shows. The tool ran through the 56 highest-grossing movies released in 2018 in 20 countries, including the U.S., Canada, India, Japan, Germany, Peru and Senegal.\n\nIt found that the women portrayed in leadership positions were more likely to depicted as sexual objects or with nudity, compared with their male counterparts, representing how movies are often told from the \u201cmale gaze.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur most popular films are sending the message that leadership is primarily a male domain,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cWomen leaders are subject to the male gaze and not really \u2018in charge.\u2019\u201d\n\nThese films show a world which is run by men, for men.\" \u201cRewrite Her Story,\u201d a study on representation of female leaders in major movies\n\nFemale leaders were more than four times as likely \u201cto be shown wearing revealing clothing\u201d \u2014 30% of them, versus only 7% of male leaders in the movies analyzed in the study.\n\nThe women in the 56 films were also almost twice more likely \u201cto be shown as partially nude\u201d than men (15% versus 8%), and four times more likely to appear \u201ccompletely naked\u201d on screen (2% versus 0.5% of male characters).\n\nThe study also found that the women portrayed in these movies were almost four times more likely to be sexually objectified \u2014 for example, \u201cthe camera focused on their body parts in slow motion\u201d \u2014 and five times more likely to be sexually harassed than the men.\n\nThe study\u2019s key recommendation for making female leadership \u201cvisible and normal\u201d and not objectifying women on-screen: Hire female filmmakers and champion their work.\n\n\u201cThese films show a world which is run by men, for men,\u201d the researchers wrote, pointing out that \u201cthe filmmakers, too, are predominantly male.\u201d\n\nAmong the films that the researchers analyzed, none of them were directed by a woman, only a quarter of them had at least one female producer, and only 1 in 10 of them were written by at least one woman.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings are consistent with other studies that have shown the importance of women and girls being presented as leaders on-screen and the lack of women directing Hollywood\u2019s biggest movies.\n\nThanks in part to the Me Too movement, movie and television creators have slowly begun to scrutinize and be more mindful of the way women are portrayed, with some positive results.\n\nFor example, the recent box office hit \u201cHustlers,\u201d written and directed by Lorene Scafaria and starring Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez, follows a group of strippers who scammed their Wall Street clients after the 2008 financial crisis. It treats the women at its center with nuance, depicting their complicated relationships and motivations, rather than portraying them one-dimensionally, and the film avoids using a leering gaze when showing their bodies.\n\nSimilarly, the recent Netflix limited series \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d which documents several investigations into sexual assault, has earned praise for not sensationalizing the sexual assault incidents rather than focusing on the women at the center of the story.\n\nSTXfilms Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez in \"Hustlers,\" directed by Lorene Scafaria.\n\nAs part of the study, the researchers also interviewed girls and women ages 15 to 25 in some of the 20 countries on how they see women represented in movies, television and advertising. Many reported feeling discouraged by seeing women often in domestic roles, as sidekicks or as romantic interests to male lead characters.\n\n\u201cEven if I know I could be a leader, I won\u2019t do it because I see it is just for men, not for women,\u201d a 22-year-old woman from Uganda told the researchers. \u201cSo that affects me. I\u2019ll have to sit back and watch men doing it, even though I am capable of doing it too.\u201d\n\n\u201cFemales aren\u2019t in the top leadership positions almost anywhere in the world, and... even female representation in politics is much lower than men, and I think that sort of translates onto our entertainment,\u201d an 18-year-old woman from Canada told the researchers. \u201cAnd I think it creates this vicious cycle.\u201d\n\nMany respondents also pointed out that in addition to not seeing enough women leaders on-screen, they also saw a lack of diversity in race, sexuality and economic class.\n\nThe researchers also interviewed female filmmakers about their experiences, with many expressing cautious optimism that more women getting opportunities to create movies and television, and employing more women in behind-the-camera roles will lead to better female representation on-screen.\n\n\u201cThis is the start of a very exciting time for women filmmakers and I can only hope that this wave for change remains powerful and effective. It is so necessary for female artists to speak out and to speak in unison especially in our current political climate,\u201d Ash Mayfair, a filmmaker from Vietnam, told the researchers, adding that a related issue is equal pay for women. \u201cEconomic support for women at all levels is the most powerful tool to achieve gender equality. We have to create jobs for women.\u201d", "description": "Women in global box office hits are more likely to be portrayed as sexual objects, according to an analysis from the group founded by actor Geena Davis.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d926144220000cd04e04cc0.jpeg?cache=fsik1sstff&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
