The Sacklers, known for a complex network of business interests, had a stake in the company Peak Resorts Inc., which owned the ski areas, according to the Post.\n\nSome of the winter resorts lie within the Catskills of New York and the vast hills of New Hampshire, Vermont and Pennsylvania -- places known to have battled the wave of opioid addiction.\n\nPeak Resorts Inc. declined to comment on the matter.\n\nThe sale, finalized last week, comes just after Purdue filed for bankruptcy in New York following a tentative settlement with many state and local governments suing it over the toll of opioids.\n\nRepresentatives for Purdue Pharma didn't mmediately respond to request for comment from FOX Business.\n\nThe plan calls for turning Purdue into a \u201cpublic benefit trust\u201d that would continue selling preecription opioids but use its profits for lawsuit settlements. The Sackler family would give up control of Purdue and contribute at least $3 billion toward the settlement.\n\nThe \"framework avoids wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and years on protracted litigation,\u201d Steve Miller, chairman of Purdue\u2019s board of directors, said in a statement, \u201cand instead will provide billions of dollars and critical resources to communities across the country trying to cope with the opioid crisis.\u201d\n\nTwo dozen states have signed on to the settlement plan along with lawyers who represent many of the 2,000-plus local governments suing the company.\n\nBut legal battles still lie ahead for Purdue, which did not admit to any wrongdoing. Several states plan to object to the settlement in bankruptcy court and to continue litigation in other courts against members of the Sackler family. They argue the family has funneled a fortune from the firm into shell companies and Swiss bank accounts, and is getting off too easily\n\nA court filing by the New York Attorney General's Office earlier this month contended that Sackler family members used Swiss and other hidden accounts to transfer $1 billion to themselves.\n\nThe Sacklers are simply \"throwing the carcass of this drug company into bankruptcy,\u201d said North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, whose state plans to join Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New York in pursuing the company.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nSince OxyContin was introduced in 1996, addiction and overdoses have surged. In both 2017 and 2018, opioids were involved in more than 47,000 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe Associated Press and FOX Business' Ken Martin contributed to this article.", "description": "The Sacklers had a stake in the company Peak Resorts Inc., which is selling the ski\u00a0sites.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Crotched-Mountain-Ski-.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
