(Sept. 17) AP, AP\n\nWhat impeachment inquiry?\n\nOn Tuesday first lady Melania Trump ignored the crescendo building on Capitol Hill and stuck to her own agenda, announcing the construction of a new tennis pavilion on the White House grounds.\n\n\"It is my hope that this private space will function as a place to gather and spend leisure time for First Families,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nThe new pavilion is being funded by private donations, the White House said, though no details about the construction's cost were available.\n\nIn a tweet, the first lady shared a photo that showed her, wearing her trademark stiletto heels, breaking ground by the old White House tennis court.\n\nExciting to break ground on the new tennis pavilion project at the White House today. Thank you to all who will help in making this legacy piece possible for future first families to gather at and enjoy for years to come. @theNationalMall@NatlParkServicepic.twitter.com/UcYLeJ27Ni \u2014 Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) October 8, 2019\n\nAccording to CNN, while there has been no previous news of the new pavilion from the White House, nor of its projected existence, in June the National Park Service, which operates the 18-acre grounds of the White House, submitted a proposal about the structure and its construction to the National Capital Planning Commission.\n\nThe building proposal states the pavilion will \"provide a unifying element for the tennis court, the Children's Garden and the Kitchen Garden,\" according to CNN. The Children's Garden was installed in 1968 by former first lady Lady Bird Johnson, while the Kitchen Garden was created in 2009 by then-first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nIt's been business as usual this week for Trump, as the Washington Post noted that the first lady seems \"unfazed\" by the growing impeachment inquiry aimed at her husband.\n\nOn Monday morning she visited the headquarters of the Drug Enforcement Administration as part of its Red Ribbon Week promoting a drug-free America. She gave a five-minute speech about her Be Best campaign and equated the dangers of the vaping epidemic to the opioid crisis.\n\nThe president, meanwhile, told House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders Tuesday that his administration will not cooperate with the House impeachment investigators because it considers their investigation to be unfair and illegitimate.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/08/melania-trump-new-tennis-pavilion-impeachment-inquiry/3914109002/", "description": "First lady Melania Trump stuck to her own agenda Tuesday, announcing the\u00a0construction of a new tennis pavilion on the White House grounds.", "authors": ["Andrea Mandell", "Published P.M.
