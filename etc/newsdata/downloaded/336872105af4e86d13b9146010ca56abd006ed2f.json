The numbers provided further evidence that Netflix\u2019s salad days may be over, particularly in the U.S., where most households that want its 12-year-old streaming service already have it.\n\nNetflix added 6.8 million subscribers worldwide from July through September, below the 7 million customers forecast by the Los Gatos, California, company. Just 520,000 of those subscribers were picked up in the U.S., below the 800,000 that management anticipated. The shortfall came after Netflix lost 123,000 subscribers in the U.S. during the April-June period, marking its first contraction in eight years.\n\nThat downturn and the uncertainty about the service\u2019s future growth is the main reason Netflix\u2019s stock had dropped by about 30% below its peak price of $423.21 reached 16 months ago. Netflix\u2019s shares surged by 8% in extended trading Wednesday, apparently because some investors had been bracing for an even bigger letdown in the third quarter.\n\nNetflix said it expects to add another 7.6 million worldwide subscribers during the final three months of the year, down from 8.8 million during the same period last year. The more conservative outlook amounted to a concession to the new entrants in the streaming market.\n\n\u201cThe launch of these new services will be noisy,\u201d Netflix advised in its third-quarter letter to shareholders. \u201cThere may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance.\u201d\n\nThe big question now is whether some of Netflix\u2019s existing subscribers will decide to cancel its service and defect to cheaper alternatives that Apple and Disney will launch within the next month.\n\nApple is charging only $5 per month for its service, set for a Nov. 1 debut, while Disney is selling a service featuring its vast library of treasured films and TV shows for just $7 per month beginning Nov. 12. Netflix\u2019s most popular plan in the U.S. costs $13 per month.\n\nNetflix is counting on the unique lineup of award-winning TV shows and movies that it has amass since expanding into original programming six years ago to help it retain its competitive edge and attract more subscribers.\n\nIt has taken advantage of its head start in video streaming to track the viewing interests of millions of households around the world, giving it valuable insights into the kind of programming that is most likely to appeal to wide swaths of its audience.\n\nThat knowledge, in theory, will help it pick and choose which TV shows and movies to back in the future as it bids for programming against the likes of Apple, Disney and existing rivals such as Amazon and AT&T;\u2019s HBO.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Netflix's subscriber growth is bogging down even before the leading video streaming service confronts high-powered threats from Apple and Walt Disney Co.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Liedtke"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/earns_netflix_85998_c0-130-3125-1952_s1200x700.jpg?46f4522e437543fafbb47efeb3dbed2ad580028a", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
