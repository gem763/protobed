For a moment, it looked as if the NASDAQ Composite might have joined the party, but it came up short at the last minute.\n\nThe market breadth was more impressive than the actual print for the major indices:\n\nNYSE\n\nAdvancers: 1,588\n\nDecliners: 1,350\n\nUp Volume: 1.9 billion\n\nDown Volume: 1.7 billion\n\nNew Highs: 154\n\nNew Lows: 22\n\nNASDAQ\n\nAdvancers: 2,019\n\nDecliners: 1,116\n\nUp Volume: 1.4 billion\n\nDown Volume: 606 million\n\nNew Highs: 167\n\nNew Lows: 54\n\nAfter the close, Alphabet (Google) posted quarterly financial results that initially sent shares tumbling more than 4%:\n\nRevenue: $40.5 billion, consensus: $40.3 billion\n\nEarnings: $10.12, consensus: $12.42\n\nAd Revenue: $33.92 billion\n\nPaid Clicks: +18%\n\nTraffic Acquisition Costs (TAC): $7.49 billion from $7.48 billion\n\nProperties Revenue: $28.65 billion +19%\n\nPixel/Cloud Revenue: $6.43 billion (consensus $6.23 billion); a year ago: $4.64 billion\n\nGoogle Building for Future\n\nGoogle is investing big time in its future and its race against other behemoths, while all seem to ignore the fact the larger they get, the bigger the bullseye on their backs.\n\nCapital Expenditure (Capex): $6.73 billion from $5.28 billion\n\nThe company plans to triple its annual Cloud revenue from $8.0 billion, which played a role in the massive hiring during the quarter when new Cloud executives were among the 6,450 new employees. Interestingly, management suggested its recent breakthrough in quantum computing could power its cloud growth - no wonder the company\u2019s rivals tried to throw cold water.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t consider selling the stock for a nano-second if I was a long-term holder.\n\nAny Bite Without FANG\n\nToday is going to be a great test for the market, which has been rallying with so-called FANG stocks mixed at best. Keep watching semiconductors and software names to power Technology.\n\nComing into the week, FANG\u2019s influence on the S&P:\n\nCapitalization: 9.6%\n\nEarnings: 3.6%\n\nRevenue: 0.4%\n\nForward Price-to-Earnings (Forward P/E) with FANG: 17.1\n\nForward Price-to-Earnings (Forward P/E) without FANG: 16.0\n\nS&P 500 Index +0.56% Communication Services (XLC) +0.93% Consumer Discretionary (XLY) +0.31% Consumer Staples (XLP) -0.20% Energy (XLE) -0.57% Financials (XLF) +0.52% Health Care (XLV) +1.03% Industrials (XLI) +0.28% Materials (XLB) +0.31% Real Estate (XLRE) -1.06% Technology (XLK) +1.27% Utilities (XLU) -1.3\n\nPortfolio Approach\n\nWe closed on Fastenal (FAST) for an 8% gain over a very short period. I like the stock, but I wanted cash and felt that the stock price could meander and grind away in the near term. We added a new Consumer Discretionary yesterday as well.\n\nCommunication Services Consumer Discretionary Consumer Staples 1 3 2 Energy Financials Healthcare 1 2 2 Industrials Materials Real Estate 3 1 1 Technology Utilities Cash 3 0 1\n\nToday\u2019s Session\n\nEarnings Parade\n\nGeneral Motors posted great financial results:\n\nRevenue $35.5 billion consensus $33.8 billion\n\nEarnings per share $1.72 consensus $1.31\n\nNote: UAW strike had $1.0 billion negative impact on revenue during the quarter.\n\nOperating Income\n\nNorth America $3.0 billion\n\nInternational -$63 million\n\nGM Segment Volume 3Q2019 3Q2018 Share Chevy Cars 75,000 118,000 7% from 10.4% Chevy Trucks 249,000 231,000 30.8% from 30.8% Chevy Crossovers 183,000 136,000 14.2% from 11.4% US 739,000 695,000 16.6% from 15.8%\n\nCadillac 40,000 37,000 Buick 52,000 46,000 GMC 141,000 127,000\n\nMerck (MRK)\n\nBeat revenue\n\nBeat earnings\n\nGuides higher\n\nPfizer (PFE)\n\nBeat revenue\n\nBeat earnings $0.75 estimate $0.62\n\nGuides higher\n\nKellogg\u2019s (K)\n\nEarnings $1.03 estimate $0.91\n\nOrganic sales $3.41 billion from $3.33 billion\n\nOrganic net sales growth was supported by consumption growth momentum in key brands such as Pringles, Cheez-It, Rice Krispies Treats, and Pop-Tart\n\nMasterCard (MA)\n\nBeat revenue\n\nBeat earnings $2.15 versus consensus $2.01\n\nGross Dollar Volume\n\nCredit cards $245 billion +14.9%\n\nDebit cards $249 billion +8.8%\n\nAuto Nation (AN)\n\nComp store +3.0% consensus +1.9%\n\nDomestic car income +5%\n\nImport car income +2%\n\nPremium luxury car income +16%\n\nThe major indices are set to open under a little pressure.", "description": "Yesterday, the S&P 500 opened at a new record high .10/29/2019 19:56:08PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/361/961af30f-4ed8-4db3-994c-0af3726c6edf.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
