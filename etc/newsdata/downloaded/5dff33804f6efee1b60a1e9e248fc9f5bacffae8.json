There's no guarantee that Boris Johnson would necessarily win an outright majority.\n\n\"And if a government is formed that wants to hold another referendum, then there would necessarily have to be another extension after this.\"\n\nThis is Johnson's third attempt to call an early election. He lost two similar votes in September because opponents said they wanted to first make sure Britain could not leave the EU without a deal.\n\nBritain has laws setting out a fixed schedule for an election every five years, with provisions for holding an early election. To hold an early election, Johnson would need two thirds of MPs to vote for it.\n\nAnother possible way to trigger an early election could be to pass a one-line act of parliament; this would simply state that parliament had decreed that an election will take place on a certain date and would need to be approved by a simple majority in the Commons.\n\nBut opposition parties could also add amendments, such as reducing the voting age.\n\nAn election can also be triggered if opponents put down a motion of no confidence in the government and win a simple majority for it. This would lead to a 14-day period during which others can seek to form a new government by a vote of confidence. If this cannot be achieved, an election is called.\n\nHowever, because the Prime Minister is himself arguing for an election, this route is not expected to be the one chosen.", "description": "A European law expert from Cambridge University says a fourth Brexit extension could follow a UK election. \n\nProfessor Kenneth Armstrong's comments to Euronews' Good Morning Europe came as an anticipated third extension to the process for the UK was being discussed by the European Union.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/28/78/1000x563_cmsv2_a170bf76-ac4a-5a83-a78f-9f6afa57e51b-4262878.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
