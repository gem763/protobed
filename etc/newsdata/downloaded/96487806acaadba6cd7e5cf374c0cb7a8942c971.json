Liz Cheney and Sen. Rand Paul is over foreign policy. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images congress Liz Cheney throws lighter fluid on feud with Rand Paul\n\nBALTIMORE \u2014 Republican Rep. Liz Cheney is not backing down from her Twitter feud with fellow Republican Rand Paul.\n\nCheney, the third-ranking House Republican and head of the party\u2019s messaging efforts, told reporters on Friday that she \u201cenjoyed\u201d duking it out with Paul over foreign policy and arguing over who is more aligned with President Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI thought it was an enlightening exchange,\u201d Cheney said at a press conference during the second day of the House GOP\u2019s annual retreat. \u201cHere I had been thinking the Senate was dull.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are some issues at the heart of that disagreement,\u201d the Wyoming Republican added. \u201cThere are issues surrounding whether you put America first, as Trump does, or if you blame America first, as Rand Paul does and has for years.\u201d\n\nCheney is slated to lead a breakout session at the retreat on Friday focused on foreign policy issues, including Russia, China and the military of the future.\n\nNot to be outdone, Paul on Friday afternoon tweeted: \"Few people have been as wrong on foreign policy over the last few years as the neocons and @Liz_Cheney. The Twitter exchange represents a real and significant debate on the future of our foreign policy between realists like myself and #NeverTrumper neoconservatives like Cheney.\"\n\nThe spat comes days after the ouster of Trump\u2019s hawkish national security adviser John Bolton, which has prompted a round of jockeying among the GOP\u2019s hawks and doves to bend the president\u2019s ear on foreign policy. And it also comes after Trump said last weekend he canceled secret peace talks with the Taliban that were planned for Camp David.\n\nPaul, a libertarian senator from Kentucky, fired the first shot, sharing an article criticizing Cheney and asking why \u201cneocons continue to advocate for endless wars.\u201d Cheney, an interventionist-minded member of the Armed Services Committee, hit back, saying, \u201cI stand with @realDonaldTrump and our men and women in uniform who will never surrender to terrorists, unlike @RandPaul, who seems to have forgotten that today is 9/11.\u201d\n\nThe fight then devolved, with Cheney jabbing Paul about being a \"big loser\" in the 2016 primary and Paul's top aide stepping in to call Cheney a \"chickenhawk.\" And Paul himself trolled Cheney with a thread highlighting all the times Cheney has split with Trump, an effort seen by some of Cheney\u2019s allies aimed at damaging her prospects in a potential Senate bid.\n\nCheney is still considering whether to run for the Wyoming Senate seat left open after Sen. Mike Enzi announced his retirement in May. Paul has already endorsed Cheney\u2019s potential rival, former Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), who officially jumped into the race earlier this summer.\n\nThe feud between Cheney and Paul runs deep. Their fathers \u2014 former Vice President Dick Cheney and failed presidential candidate and former Rep. Ron Paul \u2014 served alongside each other in the House and disagreed over foreign policy issues.\n\n", "description": "\u201cHere I had been thinking the Senate was dull,\" Cheney said.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a6/3d/4116ee314660b6b1a27b58c38202/190913-liz-cheney-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
