It handed over its final report to President Cyril Ramaphosa in December 2018.\n\nMomoniat on Tuesday said the proposed legislative amendments would also include amendments to the South African Revenue Service Act and the Tax Administration Act. The process would include public comments and hearings, just as the Tax Administration Laws Amendment Bill did.\n\n\"The commission made several proposals related to governance or strengthening organisational leadership, requiring amendments to current legislation to be overseen by the minister of finance and we are introducing a bill next year,\" said Momoniat.\n\nUnder Moyane, SARS also faced controversy for its deal with consultancy Bain & Company, which was found to have developed an operating model which hampered the revenue service's capacity to operate. The company has paid R217m back to SARS, which covers all its past fees plus interest.\n\nIn December 2018 Bain called its involvement with the tax agency under Moyane a \"humbling episode\", saying that there is evidence to suggest that Moyane was \"pursuing a personal political agenda at SARS\".\n\nSARS Commissioner Edward Kieswetter told the committee that as a result of the Nugent report findings, the revenue service was asked by Treasury to look at the processes of procurement to see if there was any abuse.\n\n\"We had to review our standard practices. We were asked to review an IT contract and whether disclosures of conflict of interest and whether SARS derived value for money. SARS has reviewed procurement policy and aligned it to the directive,\" Kieswetter said.\n\nKieswetter told the committee that since referring the Bain contract at SARS to the Director of Priority Criminal Investigations in April, the revenue service has kept a close eye on procurement processes and provisions to prevent abuse.", "description": "Draft legislation to tighten governance at the SA Revenue Service will be tabled early next year.", "authors": ["Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8680/6068e701ddbd4dd8819203be2f418894.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
