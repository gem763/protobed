REUTERS/Temilade Adelaja\n\nThe teenager has been cycling on the one-wheeled vehicle for four years, learning the skill at a dedicated school, the Gkb - or \u201cGod knows best\u201d - Unicycle Academy, in Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t actually do it very much so it looks new to people when they see it with us,\u201d Oguntokun said at an after-school practice session, where pupils learned how to ride in unison, holding hands and twirling around each other.\n\nA performance skill rarely seen on the streets of the west African country, Olalekan Kuyoro founded the academy in 2014 and has trained more than 40 children since.\n\nAfter failing to get into university, Kuyoro learned to unicycle in 2012, soon deciding to teach children full-time rather than adults, saying they picked it up faster.\n\n\u201cI started with ... a seven-year-old boy and I was amazed that (it) took me a month to ride and a seven-year-old boy could just do it easily,\u201d the 29-year-old said.\n\nThe self-funded school, which holds classes in Kuyoro\u2019s driveway, trains children aged seven to 15, teaching them juggling, skipping and other tricks on unicycles. It has 18 unicycles, each costing 7,000 naira ($23)and requiring regular maintenance.\n\nPupils put on paid performances at events and carnivals and also impromptu shows at market venues when in need of urgent funds for costumes, unicycles and, sometimes, food.\n\nThey take home money from their performances, Kuyoro said, and also show off their skills in Instagram posts, where the school\u2019s account has more than 16,000 followers.\n\n\u201cPeople really don\u2019t know what it is, like a broken bike. They are like \u2018What is the future for this thing? I\u2019d rather put my child in football academy.\u2019 So I have to talk to them,\u201d he said, adding the daily rehearsals kept pupils from hanging out on the streets.\n\n\u201cWe take a lot of kids out of the street ... so what they are doing now is channelling their energy towards productive thing instead of doing funny things.\u201d\n\n($1 = 306.4000 naira)", "description": "In a driveway of a suburban Lagos house, 14-year-old Kehinde Oguntokun juggles colourful circus clubs as he swings around on a unicycle.", "authors": ["Nneka Chile", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442253785&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0XV", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
