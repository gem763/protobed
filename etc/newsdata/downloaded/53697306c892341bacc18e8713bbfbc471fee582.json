We\u2019re living in a world with a global debt bubble, and any time you get debt bubbles of this magnitude that are global that are fueled by speculation, something\u2019s going to happen\u201d he said.\n\nWhen is all this going to happen? Giustra said that the signal for the beginning of the bull rally in gold was the Fed\u2019s reversal policy from hiking to lowering rates this year.\n\nWill it explode? Certainly not today\n\nGold is trading negative on Wednesday as investors are cheering news from Hong Kong as leader Carrie Lam said that she will withdraw the extradition bill that sparked mass protests months ago.\n\nOn the other hand, the UK Parliament voted against the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plan, and it opened the door for another Brexit delay. It helped the Pound and global risk interest.\n\nGold pared gains at 1,550\n\nXAUUSD 1-hour chart Gold September 4 More\n\nGold is trading negative on Wednesday after two days of gains; however, the unit remains moving inside the range it has been in the last eight sessions.\n\nThe metal tested the 1,550 level overnight, but the unit was unable to break above the resistance. Then, it started to fall until it found support at 1,530 in the American morning.\n\nXAU/USD is currently trading at 1,540, 0.53% negative on the day.

Above, August 25 high at 1,555 is waiting for bulls.\n\nTo the downside, supports are at 1,530.
