(Toby Melville/Reuters)\n\nMeghan, the Duchess of Sussex, launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday newspaper as her husband, Prince Harry, blasted the British tabloid press on Tuesday for behavior he said \u201cdestroys lives.\u201d\n\nThe duchess, who is being represented by the law firm Schillings, filed a claim in London\u2019s High Court against the paper and Associated Newspapers, its parent company, following an allegation that the newspaper \u201cunlawfully\u201d printed a private letter.\n\nIn a lengthy statement published on Tuesday, Harry said his wife had become \u201cone of the latest victims\u201d of the British tabloid press that \u201cwages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences.\u201d\n\nHe said that his \u201cdeepest fear is history repeating itself.\u201d\n\nReferring to his late mother, Princess Diana, Harry said, \u201cI lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u201d\n\nPrincess Diana was one of the most photographed women in the world before she died in a car crash in a Paris tunnel in 1997. At the time of the accident, her car was being pursued by photographers.\n\n[Princess Diana walked through a minefield 22 years ago. Prince Harry is retracing her steps.]\n\nHarry said the couple were taking legal action after a \u201cruthless campaign\u201d in the press, which he described as \u201cbullying.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere comes a point when the only thing to do is to stand up to this behaviour, because it destroys people and destroys lives. Put simply, it is bullying, which scares and silences people. We all know this isn't acceptable, at any level. We won't and can't believe in a world where there is no accountability for this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe legal action is being funded privately by the royal couple and any proceeds will be donated to an anti-bullying charity.\n\nA Mail on Sunday spokesman said the publication \u201cstands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously. Specifically, we categorically deny that the Duchess\u2019s letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman said the article in question was published on Feb. 10 and included an interview with Meghan\u2019s father, Thomas Markle, and extracts from a handwritten letter he received from his daughter after her wedding.\n\nThis is not the first time Prince Harry has lashed out at the British press. Shortly after he and Meghan began dating, the prince issued an unusually blunt statement in which he condemned the media and social media trolls for their \u201cracial undertones\u201d and \u201coutright sexism.\u201d\n\nHe also successfully sued a photography agency that flew a helicopter over his country home in Oxfordshire, taking photos that he charged \u201cvery seriously undermined the safety and security\u201d of his family.\n\n[Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, guest-edits British Vogue, revealing women she admires]\n\nHarry said on Tuesday that the invasive coverage had \u201cescalated over the past year,\u201d during Meghan\u2019s pregnancy and since the birth of their son Archie.\n\nThe royals said that their particular legal action related to the contents of a private letter published \u201cunlawfully in an intentionally destructive manner to manipulate you, the reader, and further the divisive agenda of the media group in question.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition to their unlawful publication of this private document, they purposely misled you by strategically omitting select paragraphs, specific sentences, and even singular words to mask the lies they had perpetuated for over a year,\u201d Harry said.\n\nHe said there is a \u201chuman cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face \u2014 as so many of you can relate to \u2014 I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been.\u201d\n\nHarry said that the \u201cpositive coverage\u201d of the couple over the past week \u2014 they have been on a tour of southern Africa \u2014 highlights the \u201cdouble standards of this specific press pack that has vilified her almost daily for the past nine months; they have been able to create lie after lie at her expense simply because she has not been visible while on maternity leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is the same woman she was a year ago on our wedding day, just as she is the same woman you've seen on this Africa tour,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that for \u201cselect media this is a game, and one that we have been unwilling to play from the start. I have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nGolden rule broken?
