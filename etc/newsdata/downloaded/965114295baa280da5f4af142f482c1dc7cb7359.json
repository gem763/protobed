Sword and Shield are also the first installments to break the link with past games; you won\u2019t be able to import the pok\u00e9mon you may have been collecting for the last decade or so into these new entries, much to the die-hard Pok\u00e9mon community\u2019s everlasting frustration.\n\nIt\u2019s about balancing what people love about \u2018Pok\u00e9mon\u2019 with making it accessible\n\nBut there are reasons why these games aren\u2019t just more of the same, and why longtime features and traditions may have been forsaken for newer, innovative approaches, like the bombastic Dynamax and Gigantamax transformations that have taken the internet by storm. According to Sword and Shield director Shigeru Ohmori and producer Junichi Masuda, whom I spoke with earlier this month through a translator at Nintendo\u2019s Bay Area offices, it\u2019s about properly balancing what makes Pok\u00e9mon such a beloved series with what can make it fresh and accessible to new players.\n\nSword and Shield represent a bold move forward for Pok\u00e9mon that builds both on last year\u2019s accessible Let\u2019s Go entries and the mobile Pok\u00e9mon Go that\u2019s introduced millions of new players around the world to the series. It features new open-world environments, multiplayer dungeon battles, and a more approachable storyline that is less systemized around collecting monsters and gym badges and more narrative-driven. Yet there are still new monsters to collect and gym leaders to overcome, and the general approach of turn-based battling remains intact.\n\nIn that sense, Game Freak wants Sword and Shield to do three things at once: to be a proper next step for all the new Let\u2019s Go fans, push the series forward with unique and interesting gameplay changes, and appeal to players who might have spent the last 23 years with the series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say that Sword and Shield and Let\u2019s Go, Pikachu! are really different. In terms of basic structure, being an RPG game with a story you follow through, they\u2019re similar in that regard. So it\u2019s a natural progression to go from Let\u2019s Go, Pikachu! or Let\u2019s Go, Eevee! to Sword and Shield. It\u2019s just a step up from that,\u201d Ohmori says. \u201cI think anyone who maybe started with Pok\u00e9mon Go and then first learned what a traditional RPG is through Let\u2019s Go, Pikachu! and Let\u2019s Go, Eevee!, they\u2019d be able to ease in pretty quickly to Sword and Shield.\u201d\n\nGame Freak also took some learnings from Let\u2019s Go, most notably the ability to see random pok\u00e9mon encounters animated on the map, so you can avoid them if you like and only engage in fights when you know you may be facing a creature you\u2019re trying to catch. \u201cOnce Let\u2019s Go, Pikachu! and Let\u2019s Go, Eevee! came out, the reaction to that [feature] was so positive and people really enjoyed being able to see them roaming around, we decided to go back and incorporate the system in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield,\u201d says Ohmori.\n\nHands-on with Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield Game Freak knows it has a die-hard fan base; just look at the national dex controversy that erupted earlier this year. And there is a lot riding on Sword and Shield. They\u2019re the first mainline Pok\u00e9mon games for the Nintendo Switch, breaking with a 23-year tradition of releasing core titles on portable-only consoles starting first with Red and Blue on the Game Boy. Yet Game Freak has set out to create a new version of Pok\u00e9mon that straddles the line between old and new in many of the same ways Sun and Moon did, with the added benefits of the Switch that let it double as a console and a handheld. In my time with Shield\u2019s first hour and a half, it\u2019s already apparent that these games, which come out on November 15th, mark a bold step forward for Pok\u00e9mon, even if they might not do enough to appease the crowd of fans that just want more of the same with better graphics.\n\nBut the last thing Game Freak wanted was to dump overly complicated games onto a player base that still skews younger and continues to add new devotees. After all, the Pok\u00e9mon franchise is continuously expanding. New players can come in from the wildly successful anime, last year\u2019s well-reviewed Detective Pikachu live-action film, or Pok\u00e9mon Go, which still counts tens of millions of monthly active users worldwide. And it\u2019s becoming more likely with each passing year that new parents who played the games as young kids or teenagers are now introducing the games to their children.\n\nThat\u2019s why holding onto tradition sometimes takes the backseat to coming up with new features, which can be more widely enjoyed by anyone who picks up the new games regardless of their past Pok\u00e9mon prowess. \u201cIt\u2019s really a challenge a lot of the time. We know that some of the traditions are important to a lot of our longtime fans, but at the same time as creators, we always want to come with new things and to surprise our players,\u201d Ohmori says.\n\nIn some cases in Sword and Shield, Game Freak is able to both stay true to tradition while also trying something new. Take, for instance, the starter pok\u00e9mon. Sword and Shield feature your standard fire, water, and grass type starters. But instead of being given one from your local pok\u00e9mon scientist, a Professor Oak type, you\u2019re given the choice from your best friend\u2019s older brother, the Galar region champion Leon, who becomes your mentor.\n\nYour rival, Leon\u2019s younger brother Hop, also opts against choosing the starter you\u2019re weak against \u2014 the case with a vast majority of the earlier mainline games \u2014 and instead picks the one you\u2019re strong against. That ends up tilting the scales a little bit in your favor every time you fight. That relationship between your character and Hop is cast in a different, more positive light, building on how Sun and Moon turned the competition with your hometown rival into one with deeper narrative ties about friendship and the strength of the bonds between you and your pok\u00e9mon companions.\n\nAs for the starters themselves, Game Freak also took cues from the real world. In particular, Ohmori says they tried to predict how the pok\u00e9mon would be shared on social media and in memes, as well as perceived by the broader gaming culture.\n\n\u201cI think with the first three pok\u00e9mon \u2014 Grookey, Scorbunny, and Sobble in particular \u2014 it would be fair to say we did try to think about how players and fans would react when we were designing them. We actually went out of our way to assign more of a specific personality to these three pok\u00e9mon than we typically do for other pok\u00e9mon,\u201d Ohmori says. \u201cWe really focused on giving them distinct personalities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe actually went out of our way to assign more of a specific personality to these three pok\u00e9mon.\u201d\n\nOhmori says Grookey is designed to be an upbeat, party-loving character, with Scorbunny being an energetic and exuberant one. Sobble is the sad, mopey type. \u201cWhen we were making them, we were thinking, \u2018Oh, these type of people will like this character.\u2019 We definitely had that on our minds for the three starter pok\u00e9mon,\u201d Ohmori adds.\n\n\u201cThis was a learning for us specifically with the Sword and Shield starters,\u201d Masuda says. \u201cThese days, it\u2019s really easy to get feedback directly from fans or social media. Both Ohmori and myself are on Twitter and interacting with fans and getting all sorts of opinions and really cool messages sent to us.\u201d He says the goal was to give the starters a more distinct personality, specifically to get more animated and passionate reactions from fans. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wide range of reactions, but people are really excited about them in general. I think we can say it was a success going this route.\u201d\n\nWhen asked which starters Ohmori and Masuda preferred specifically, they were quick to act. Sitting between the two of them were three stuffed animal versions of the pok\u00e9mon, and Ohmori picked up Grookey, while Masuda chose Scorbunny. Poor Sobble was left on its own. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be pretty clear what kind of personality... maybe not your personality, but the kind of person you like depending on which starter you choose,\u201d Masuda says. \u201cBe careful in giving that away with your starter.\u201d", "description": "Chatting with Sword and Shield director Shigeru Ohmori and producer Junichi Masuda from Game Freak about how to balance tradition with taking creative risks.", "authors": ["Nick Statt", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XgZTvGQXhmmeSyJfoF84U7yHNJE=/0x292:4032x2403/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19314293/pokemon_game_freak_creators_devs_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
