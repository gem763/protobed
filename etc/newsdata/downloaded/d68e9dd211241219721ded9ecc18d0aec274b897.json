The result is an awkward, uneven film, with writer-director Taika Waititi conjuring some touching moments, but unable to pull off the magic act this \"Rabbit\" trick requires.\n\nBeyond adapting Christine Leunens' book, Waititi (an indie darling whose studio credentials include \"Thor: Ragnarok\") also plays the role of Adolf Hitler, the slightly funky imaginary friend of 10-year-old Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis), who wants nothing more than to be a good Hitler youth.\n\nJojo's redeemable nature is evident early on, when he balks at killing a rabbit during the Nazi youth camp he's attending, earning himself that unfortunate nickname. \"You are not one of them,\" he's told.\n\nStill, his worldview and preconceived notions are really challenged when he discovers that his single mom (Scarlett Johansson) is sheltering a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic.\n\nThe not-so-subtle message is that Jojo's prejudice and hatred begins to erode as he's exposed to a representative of the very group that he casually demonized. Meanwhile, Hitler keeps appearing to him, with Waititi vamping it up in an anachronistic way (\"That was intense!\" he gushes) clearly designed to hold Hitler up as an object of ridicule.\n\nRead More", "description": "Taika Waititi uses Hitler to awkwardly convey anti-hate message, in World War II satire featuring Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191014180141-jojo-rabbit-taika-waititi-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
