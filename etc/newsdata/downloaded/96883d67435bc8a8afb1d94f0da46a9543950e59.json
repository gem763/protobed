The top Democrat in Congress said the actions are unacceptable.\n\nSecretary of Defense Mark Esper said Friday that the decision came at the request of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and represented a \u201cfirst step\u201d in the U.S. response. He reiterated U.S. statements that evidence collected to date shows Iran was responsible for the attacks. The briefing by Esper and General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, followed a meeting of national security officials at the White House.\n\n\u201cIran is waging a deliberate campaign to destabilize the Middle East,\u201d Esper told reporters at the Pentagon. He added that the U.S. has shown \u201cgreat restraint\u201d in responding so far, but called the strike on Saudi Aramco facilities on Saturday a \u201cdramatic escalation.\u201d\n\nEsper and Dunford are still deciding on the specific number of troops and weapons systems but said the personnel deployment will be relatively small, not numbering in the thousands, and that more details would be forthcoming.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Saturday said the decision is an attempt by the administration to circumvent the will of Congress, which adopted resolutions to block arms sales to the Saudis and U.A.E. and condemn the Saudis for the \u201ccontinued assault\u201d on men, women and children.\n\n\u201cThese unacceptable actions are cause for alarm,\u201d Pelosi said Saturday in a statement. \u201cAmericans are weary of war, and have no interest in entering another Middle East conflict, particularly on behalf of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the U.S. missile defense assistance, Esper said \u201cwe are calling on many other countries who all have these capabilities to do two things -- stand up and condemn these attacks\u201d and also contribute equipment.\n\nU.S. and Saudi analyses of the attack have described the strike as complex, involving a mix of low-flying drones and cruise missiles coming from the north. The attack exposed glaring vulnerabilities in Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense capabilities despite having spent hundreds of billions of dollars on weaponry in recent years.\n\nSwarms of Drones\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an international action led by the U.S. and in coordination with the Saudi kingdom to protect the navigation in the gulf and the Arabian sea,\u201d Saudi Arabia\u2019s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir said in a news conference in Riyadh on Saturday. This way \u201ctankers and oil supplies are not subject to any complications from Iran,\u201d he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has already taken delivery of Patriot-3 hit-to-kill missiles bought years ago to defend against cruise and ballistic missiles. The kingdom earlier this year finalized a long-sought after contract for Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s Thaad missile interceptors designed to intercept ballistic missiles at higher altitudes. It\u2019s not known whether any Thaad batteries have been delivered.\n\n\u201cNo single system is going to be able to defend against a threat like\u201d the combination of systems launched against Saudi Arabia last week, Dunford said. \u201cBut a layered system of defensive capabilities would mitigate the risk of swarms of drones or other attacks that may come from Iran.\u201d\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, who has repeatedly said Iran was responsible for the attack, returned early Friday from a two-day trip to Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E., saying he wanted to begin building a coalition that would organize a response to Iran.\n\nDuring a news conference earlier Friday, President Donald Trump signaled he\u2019s trying to avoid a military conflict. Trump campaigned in 2016 on getting the U.S. out of Mideast conflicts and he\u2019s repeatedly criticized the second U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\n\u201cI will say I think the sanctions work, and the military would work,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cBut that\u2019s a very severe form of winning.\u201d\n\nOn Friday the Treasury Department announced it is sanctioning Iran\u2019s central bank and sovereign wealth fund, a move aimed at squelching any remaining trade the country conducts with Europe and Asia.\n\nThe Blame Game\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned that any U.S. or Saudi strike on his country in response to the attacks on the kingdom\u2019s critical oil facilities would lead to \u201call-out war.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. will send a \u201cmoderate\u201d number of troops to the Middle East and additional missile defense capabilities to Saudi Arabia in response to last weekend\u2019s attack on oil facilities, top Pentagon officials said.
