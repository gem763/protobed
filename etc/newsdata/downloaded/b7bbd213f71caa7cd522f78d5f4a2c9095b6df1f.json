Getty\n\n\"I could play easy in the Premier League, so if United needs me, I'm here,\" he said with a grin in Los Angeles. \"But Galaxy has me, so I'm sorry.\n\n\"Nah, I did my job in Europe. I enjoyed it, I have 33 trophies that I brought with me here and hopefully I can get something here.\n\n\"And then we will see where that adventure finishes.\"\n\nUnited could certainly have done with Ibrahimovic's cutting edge at the weekend as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side fell to a galling 2-1 home defeat to Crystal Palace.\n\n\"I look, I look, I look,\" the striker told PA. \"I saw the last game and I think they were unlucky.\n\n\"If they score the penalty, it's a different game but a game in England is not finished until its finished.\n\n\"Anything can happen, especially in the last minutes where everything is in the heat of the moment.\"\n\nHaving come a cropper in the dying embers of Saturday's game, United will be hoping there is no late sting in the tail regarding Paul Pogba as the European transfer window comes to a close.\n\nSubject of speculation and scrutiny over the summer after admitting that he would be open to a new a challenge, Ibrahimovic recently said the midfielder should be allowed to leave if he wants to go.\n\nAsked if he keeps in contact with Pogba, he said: \"I speak with him. A lot of advice I give - but nothing I share with you!\"\n\nOne former team-mate definitely on the move is Wayne Rooney.\n\nAn impressive force in MLS for DC United, England and Manchester United's all-time top scorer will join Derby as player-coach in January - and there is talk that his American exit could come even sooner.\n\n\"No, I'm not surprised (that he's going back),\" Ibrahimovic said. \"Absolutely not.\n\n\"I think he came, he tried, he did his best and, yeah, he had patience. You need a lot of patience and it has finished, the patience.\n\n\"I mean, my deal is until December 31. What happens afterwards I don't know.\n\n\"I'm in a different position than Wazza. Wazza is much younger than me. I am old but still dominating, still making the difference.\n\n\"Let's see what happens. I have to be feeling good physically.\"\n\nIbrahimovic is fully focused on taking the Galaxy into the play-offs and onto what he hopes will be the league crown in a fifth country.\n\n\"I think MLS is an exciting league,\" the striker, who turns 38 in October, said. \"It's a growing league - a lot of things to come in place.\n\n\"New teams coming in. I mean, you have teams playing away for half the season and then they play at home because the stadium was not done. There's a lot of things happening.\n\n\"I enjoy it but there is a lot of things to become better, to come up in level, which it will time by time. We're in the US, where nothing is impossible.\"\n\nIbrahimovic believes MLS requires a few changes to fulfil its undoubted potential, nodding towards things like air travel and budgets.\n\n\"I think it will take time (to become a major soccer force) but they have all the possibilities they can,\" he added.\n\n\"But there is a lot of rules here with the budget. I mean, you saw Rooney, he tweeted something with the travelling. It's not easy all those things.\"\n\nPA", "description": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic believes he could easily still cut it in the Premier League - and the self-styled lion would be ready to roar for Manchester United again was it not for his determination to lead LA Galaxy to glory.
