When you're buying someone from Swansea who was probably brought as someone who could flourish at a later date, who has now been forced into the forefront as the main man in the team at the moment.\n\n\"That says where United are at this minute and I think time is something that is needed. It's not afforded to too many people in the game at the moment.\n\n\"Ole probably needs another window to get more people in, shuffle the pack and get more out, then you can really start to judge him on that.\"", "description": "Former Red Devils defender says club didn't expect overnight success and won't rush to get rid of manager", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Empics Sport", "Bt Sports", "Manchester United Via Getty Imag"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20554751.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League-St-James-Park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
