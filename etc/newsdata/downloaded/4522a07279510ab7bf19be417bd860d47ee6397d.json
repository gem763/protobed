Actions are what we need for a successful Common Agricultural Policy. I wish him good luck for his new task.\"\n\nUlrike M\u00fcller, from the liberal Renew Europe grouping, told POLITICO: \"We are not fully convinced but we give him a chance to improve himself!\" The Greens' MEP spokesperson in the committee, Martin Ha\u00fcsling, said: \"Today he was concrete on a lot of points ... He was clear on organic agriculture.\"\n\nAnd a European Parliament official said \"quite a lot\" of the political groups had expressed \"big reservations\" about him during a closed door meeting after the hearing.", "description": "Poland\u2019s candidate for the European Commission scrapes through a second hearing.", "authors": ["Eddy Wax", "Arthur Neslen", "Zosia Wanat"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174445470-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
