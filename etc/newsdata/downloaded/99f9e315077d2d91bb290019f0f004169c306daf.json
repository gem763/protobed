Drink had been taken. Talk turned to a comparison between fighters.\n\nArum made his argument for a certain famous name as the greatest. The following night, same again. More snow, more drink, and more of the same discussion. This time Arum made his case for an entirely different boxer. One of the party called him on it. Didn\u2019t he say the exact opposite on Tuesday?\n\nFormer British Cycling and Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman gave new evidence on Tuesday\n\n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Arum, \u2018but yesterday I was lying. Today I\u2019m telling the truth.\u2019\n\nThe story has gone down in legend as representing the unreliability of boxing promoters, and Arum in particular. It gets thrown at him in press conferences, in conversation, even in court.\n\nYet, the essence of it is harmless. Boxing promoters are there to sell a show and do it by any means necessary, we all know that. They bluff, they exaggerate, they contradict. The fight\u2019s on, the fight\u2019s off, he\u2019s a bum, he\u2019s the greatest, he\u2019s taken up wrestling instead. It\u2019s OK. It\u2019s boxing.\n\nNot really what you want to hear from a doctor, though, is it? Not really what you want from a man with your life in his hands.\n\nThe indication is Freeman will say he ordered Testogel for the personal use of Shane Sutton\n\n\u2018I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve got two weeks to live.\u2019 \u2018Oh my God, doctor. But yesterday you said I was fine.\u2019 \u2018Yes, but yesterday I was lying. Today I\u2019m telling the truth.\u2019\n\nSee? So that\u2019s the first problem with Freeman\u2019s evidence. There are certain people whose position of trust is so great that lying in a professional capacity is unacceptable.\n\nAnd Freeman was acting in a professional capacity for British Cycling. He was not the jobbing GP his lawyer claimed at the GMC hearing. He is on the GMC register as a specialist in sports medicine; before starting at British Cycling and Team Sky he was with Bolton Wanderers as a doctor to the youth academy, and had a specific brief to deal with anti-doping.\n\nIn other words, he knows right from wrong. There may not have been lives at stake the day the Testogel was ordered but Freeman was a medical practitioner at his place of work.\n\nWhat was written up, what it was for, the paperwork and process around the 30 sachets of Testogel delivered to the Team Sky and British Cycling headquarters at the Manchester Velodrome in 2011 is a matter of ethical principle. As is telling the truth about the purpose of the medication and its intended destination. To admit lying and covering up and now, coming clean, as if this is anything less than the latest self-serving ploy, is hard to swallow. If Freeman lied then, why should anyone believe this newest version of events?\n\nFreeman, do not forget, has had many opportunities to give a frank account of this, and other, controversial incidents during his time as British Cycling\u2019s doctor. He has dodged investigations and parliamentary sittings, he has written a book and given interviews around its publication. At any time the truth, as he sees it, could have come out.\n\nThe indication is that Freeman will say the Testogel was not for an athlete at all, but for Shane Sutton, the British Cycling coach, for personal, private use.\n\nSutton (left) pictured with Team Sky's Bradley Wiggins at the Tour de France in July 2010\n\nSutton will deny this, and again, in the light of Freeman\u2019s casual acquaintance with honesty it leaves more questions than answers. For instance: why would an intelligent man, a doctor, who would clearly know the implications, have Testogel delivered to a centre of sporting excellence, an Olympic base, no less?\n\nTestogel was one of the substances Lance Armstrong used. Testogel, in a sporting context, carries the taint of cheating, however innocent its purpose may have been. To order 30 sachets from a company in Oldham, Fit4Sport, to be delivered to the velodrome is at best careless, at worst reckless, because even having the stuff around arouses suspicion.\n\nOnly this month placing Mo Farah, Alberto Salazar and a box containing testosterone in the kitchen of the same flat was enough to cause headlines. And there is absolutely no suggestion that Farah even knew of its existence.\n\nSo why would a British Cycling doctor think the velodrome a suitable point for delivery? Who has medicine delivered to a place of work rather than a home, or a pharmacy for collection, anyway? If this was a private matter for Sutton why would he not want it privately resolved?\n\nThe complexities of this case mean it might not be resolved until late December, yet already we are in familiar territory: reputational damage. For if Freeman lied about this, what else did he lie about?\n\nThe complicated case involving Freeman isn't expected to be resolved until late December\n\nThis is the doctor who ordered the mysterious Jiffy bag, its contents and mission still unknown due to \u2018inaccurate medical records\u2019. This is the doctor who prescribed Bradley Wiggins the corticosteroid triamcinolone under therapeutic user exemption before his 2012 Tour de France win.\n\nIt is not a good look if he now admits to telling \u2018a lot of lies\u2019 even if these events are unrelated.\n\nFor any day now British Cycling will unveil their new bike for Tokyo 2020. It might make its debut at the World Cup in Glasgow next month. Early reports suggest it will be their strangest looking bike yet, and is the work of aerodynamics expert and Cambridge University professor Tony Purnell.\n\nHe has been the head of technical development at British Cycling since 2013, operating a department known as \u2018the secret squirrel club\u2019 out of a design centre called \u2018Room X\u2019 at British Cycling\u2019s headquarters.\n\nAnd this is what we have always been led to believe. That we\u2019re clever. We\u2019re the brilliant ones, with our brilliant inventions and our special suits and our marginal gains. So when the same place that houses Room X, the secret squirrels and Professor Purnell also takes delivery of 30 sachets of Testogel, it rather tarnishes the image.\n\nFor there\u2019s nothing clever about that; and lying about it, even less so.", "description": "CHIEF SPORTS WRITER: There are certain people whose position of trust is so great that lying in a professional capacity is unacceptable.
