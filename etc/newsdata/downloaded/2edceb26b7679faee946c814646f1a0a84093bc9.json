The question matters for technology giant SoftBank as well as WeWork\u2019s embattled parent company.\n\nThe provider of trendy offices and associated services this week postponed its initial public offering until at least next month. Public-market investors have balked at its valuation\u2014set at $47 billion in a private fundraising this year\u2014and corporate governance. The startup now seems likely to fetch at the very most $20 billion in an IPO.\n\nSuch a big drop in We\u2019s valuation would hurt SoftBank, which, together with its $103 billion Vision Fund and Delta Fund, is the company\u2019s biggest outside shareholder.\n\nSoftBank and its co-investors have given nearly $11 billion to We, including the $1 billion they have committed through warrants. SoftBank marked the value of its stake up earlier this year, likely in response to the $47 billion valuation. That suggests an IPO at a much lower price would force the Japanese technology conglomerate to report billions of dollars in paper losses. The valuation write-down may not be huge relative to SoftBank\u2019s total assets, which include a $122 billion stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and $23 billion stake in Sprint. But it would affect how investors view its prospects, given that technology investing has become its major focus in the past couple of years. Postponing We\u2019s IPO would forestall the pain, but it could also create another problem for SoftBank. We won\u2019t only miss out on the $3 billion it wanted to raise in the IPO, but also $6 billion in bank loans that are conditional on the listing. That means the cash-burning company will likely need to seek financing elsewhere. SoftBank, its largest and most open-walleted shareholder, is the natural choice. SoftBank may even have to dig into its own pocket, as even its investment partners in the Vision Fund seem to have reservations about sinking more money into We. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you think Softbank should do when it comes to its investment in We? Join the conversation below. Neither option is palatable for SoftBank. Ultimately, though, the question of We\u2019s IPO exposes a bigger one: Did the cash SoftBank splurged on private technology companies in the past couple of years merely push valuations to levels unacceptable to regular stock investors? There are some good investments in the Japanese company\u2019s portfolio: Guardant Health and 10x Genomics have both surged since their IPOs. But it is precisely SoftBank\u2019s biggest bets that seem to have the most inflated valuations. Apart from We, it poured $7.7 billion into Uber . That investment is now underwater: The ride-hailing giant\u2019s stock has dropped 25% since its IPO price. SoftBank\u2019s efforts to find investors for another $100 billion technology fund make this question even more urgent.
