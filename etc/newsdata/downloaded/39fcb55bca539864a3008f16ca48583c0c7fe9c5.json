In the fourth, his popularity has dropped so far his party may lose its majority in October elections.\n\n\ufeff A secretly taped call is one reason why. Just before Christmas, Canadian Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould turned on her iPhone voice recorder for a call with the country\u2019s top bureaucrat, Michael Wernick. Mr. Trudeau and senior officials had already pressed her and her chief aide 20 times in calls, messages and in person to let a major Canadian firm avoid a criminal trial on bribery and fraud charges. She had resisted.\n\nOn the phone, Mr. Wernick said the company, SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., was considering selling itself or moving abroad, and Mr. Trudeau believed it should be given the chance to negotiate an out-of-court settlement.\n\nMr. Wernick, unaware of the recording, said: \u201cI think he is going to find a way to get it done.\u201d\n\nMs. Wilson-Raybould didn\u2019t relent: \u201cThis is going to look like nothing but political interference by the prime minister, by you, by everybody else that has been involved in this.\u201d\n\nFall From Favor Canada's governing Liberal Party has suffered in polls since news broke of the SNC-Lavalin affair. Canada's governing Liberal Party has suffered in polls since news broke of the SNC-Lavalin affair. Party popularity Conservative Liberal New Democrat October 2015 election results SNC-Lavalin affair 50 % 40 30 20 10 0 2016 \u201917 \u201918 \u201919\n\nThat\u2019s exactly how it looked to many Canadian voters when the recording surfaced after parliamentary hearings in February and March exposed details of the Trudeau government\u2019s moves to advocate for the engineering-and-construction firm. Testimony in the hearings captivated the public and turned Ms. Wilson-Raybould into one of the most recognizable Canadian politicians outside Mr. Trudeau.\n\nNow, several polls show Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberals trailing the rival Conservative Party or in a statistical tie, after beginning 2019 with a comfortable lead. Nearly two-thirds of Canadians disapprove of the job he is doing, according to polls released in mid-July by Ipsos Public Affairs and Angus Reid Institute. They cite the SNC-Lavalin matter as a primary reason.\n\nThe Canadian leader, who had a rock-star following among progressives for championing clean governance\u2014and a promise to let women and ministers have more governing say\u2014had sided with a scandal-plagued company and overruled his attorney general, eventually moving her to a lower-profile position.\n\nBased on current data, some pollsters say, the best Mr. Trudeau can expect from the election is a minority government needing another party\u2019s support to govern. \u201cIf the election becomes a referendum on Justin Trudeau,\u201d says Nik Nanos, head of Ottawa-based Nanos Research, \u201cthe Liberals may lose.\u201d\n\nJody Wilson-Raybould prepares to testify before parliamentary hearings in February.

You\u2019d have to ask them.\u201d\n\nMr. Wernick declined to comment. In the parliamentary hearings, he said his phone call and other communications with Ms. Wilson-Raybould \u201cwere entirely appropriate, lawful, legal.\u201d\n\nSNC-Lavalin is based in Montreal, a portion of which Mr. Trudeau represents in the legislature. Aides in his office met 23 times with its representatives during a roughly three-year period between the Liberal government\u2019s election in late 2015 and late 2018, lobbying records show.\n\nThat was nearly five times as many meetings SNC-Lavalin secured over the prior three years with aides to Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Compared with the Liberals, the company got little traction from the Harper administration, say people familiar with the firm and former members of the Harper government.\n\nMembers of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s administration had personal ties with the company, a reminder of the tight circles that can make up the top levels of business and politics in Canada. SNC-Lavalin Chairman Kevin Lynch was Mr. Wernick\u2019s boss between 2006 and 2009, when Mr. Lynch was Canada\u2019s chief bureaucrat and Mr. Wernick was a top public servant. SNC-Lavalin said Mr. Lynch declined to be interviewed.\n\nA Trudeau cabinet minister, Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, was the first Liberal government official to meet with SNC-Lavalin lobbyists about the firm\u2019s bid for an out-of-court settlement, according to lobbying records. He had worked closely with the company\u2019s then-CEO, Neil Bruce, between 2008 and 2012 while at a U.K. engineering firm, U.K. securities filings show.\n\nMr. Bruce didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Mr. Champagne says his past relationship with Mr. Bruce had no bearing on any meetings with SNC-Lavalin.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Trudeau says that the government\u2019s actions on SNC-Lavalin\u2019s behalf and meetings with its lobbyists weren\u2019t influenced by any past links and that Mr. Trudeau\u2019s office meets regularly with companies on a variety of matters.\n\nIn retrospect, says a senior Trudeau-government official, taking so many SNC-Lavalin meetings might not have been a wise decision.\n\nFraud allegations\n\nWith about 10 billion Canadian dollars ($7.5 billion) in 2018 sales, SNC-Lavalin employs 50,000 world-wide. It is working on a nuclear-power plant in Britain, Nevada freeways and Riyadh\u2019s subway.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How should Justin Trudeau have handled SNC-Lavalin? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn February 2015, Canadian police charged that SNC-Lavalin bribed Libyan officials and defrauded Libyan organizations between 2001 and 2011. SNC-Lavalin denied wrongdoing and said the acts in question were carried out by two employees without the company\u2019s knowledge. A former SNC-Lavalin vice president pleaded guilty in Swiss court in 2014 to corruption-related charges linked to his activity in Libya.\n\nNeil Bruce, then-CEO of SNC-Lavalin, at its annual general meeting in May. Photo: Christinne Muschi/Bloomberg News\n\nMr. Trudeau\u2019s dust-up was over whether the company should face trial on the Libya charges. A criminal conviction could trigger a ban on SNC-Lavalin\u2019s bidding on government contracts at home and abroad.\n\nAbout a week after Mr. Trudeau was sworn in as prime minister, in November 2015, SNC-Lavalin\u2019s CEO, Mr. Bruce, argued at a Montreal luncheon for a system letting companies reach out-of-court settlements without guilty pleas. Such mechanisms in the U.S. and U.K. let prosecutors suspend criminal charges in exchange for financial penalties, pledges to strengthen compliance and other measures.\n\nOver the following years, the company lobbied Mr. Trudeau\u2019s office, cabinet ministers and their aides, senior bureaucrats and opposition lawmakers, lobbying records show.\n\nIn early 2018, Finance Minister Bill Morneau incorporated a measure allowing out-of-court settlements near the back of a nearly 600-page piece of budget legislation. A spokesman for Mr. Morneau says the measure was written after consulting with business groups and the legal community, among others, and was introduced after approval from cabinet\u2014of which Ms. Wilson-Raybould was a member.\n\nThe law stipulates that only the public prosecutor\u2019s office, which operates at arm\u2019s length from the government, can determine whether a company was eligible. Only the attorney general can overturn prosecutors\u2019 decisions.\n\nIn September, the public prosecutor\u2019s office informed SNC-Lavalin it would proceed with a criminal trial. Ms. Wilson-Raybould decided against intervening, she said in parliamentary hearings this year. She and the public prosecutor\u2019s office haven\u2019t explained publicly why SNC-Lavalin wasn\u2019t invited to negotiate an out-of-court deal. Ms. Wilson-Raybould in an interview declined to discuss the reasons for the decision. The prosecutor\u2019s office declined to provide reasons for the decision.\n\nSNC-Lavalin headquarters in Montreal.

Trudeau and Wernick, according to parliamentary hearings. The meeting\u2019s agenda was aboriginal policy, but the conversation swiftly turned to SNC-Lavalin.\n\nMr. Trudeau asked whether a solution could be found, given the jobs at stake, Ms. Wilson-Raybould testified, saying Mr. Wernick warned SNC-Lavalin would likely move its headquarters to London if an out-of-court settlement wasn\u2019t an option.\n\nAn SNC-Lavalin spokesman in March said the company provided documents to prosecutors indicating a headquarters move was a worst-case scenario.\n\nMr. Trudeau reminded Ms. Wilson-Raybould he was an elected official from SNC-Lavalin\u2019s home base, she testified, saying she responded: \u201cAre you politically interfering with my role, my decision?\u201d\n\nMr. Trudeau backed off, she said. He has publicly confirmed the thrust of her account.\n\nThe next day, Sept. 18, SNC-Lavalin\u2019s Mr. Bruce met with Mr. Wernick, according to handwritten notes Mr. Wernick provided lawmakers, and discussed strategies for persuading the prosecutor\u2019s office to reconsider. Mr. Wernick told Mr. Bruce the company should focus on the public-interest argument.\n\nSNC-Lavalin requested a meeting of its lawyer and Mr. Bruce with the chief prosecutor, according to a copy of a letter sent by prosecutors to the company and filed in the Federal Court of Canada. The prosecutor\u2019s office declined and, on Oct. 9, told company lawyers its decision was final.\n\nIn an Oct. 15 letter to Mr. Trudeau, submitted in hearings, Mr. Bruce said the company had been treated poorly and one of its lawyers, former Supreme Court of Canada justice Frank Iacobucci, \u201cwas not afforded the courtesy of a meeting or even a call.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s top bureaucrat, Michael Wernick, waits to testify before lawmakers in March. Photo: Dave Chan/Getty Images\n\nMr. Wernick testified he got a call that day from Mr. Lynch, his former boss and now SNC-Lavalin chairman, who warned the company would have to make tough decisions and asked: \u201cIsn\u2019t there anything that can be done?\u201d Mr. Wernick said he told Mr. Lynch \u201cin the firmest, curtest possible terms\u201d that queries had to go through Ms. Wilson-Raybould and the public-prosecutions director.\n\nA spokeswoman for SNC-Lavalin, speaking on Mr. Lynch\u2019s behalf in May, says Mr. Lynch had requested a call with Mr. Wernick to inform him of a press release the company had issued on the prosecutors\u2019 decision.\n\nThrough the fall, officials in Mr. Trudeau\u2019s office pressed Ms. Wilson-Raybould and her chief aide to change course, according to Ms. Wilson-Raybould\u2019s testimony. On Dec. 19, she and Mr. Wernick spoke in the recorded call. She told him she realized her refusal would have consequences.\n\n\u201cI knew that this situation was coming to a head,\u201d says Ms. Wilson-Raybould, explaining her recording. \u201cThis was an extraordinary situation that required me to ensure that I protected myself.\u201d\n\nThree weeks later, while Ms. Wilson-Raybould was vacationing in Bali, Mr. Trudeau told her she would be demoted to heading veteran\u2019s affairs, she said in testimony.\n\nMr. Trudeau addresses Liberal Party candidates in July. Photo: chris wattie/Reuters\n\nOn Feb. 7, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported allegations Ms. Wilson-Raybould had faced pressure to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case before her demotion, sparking a media flurry and criticism from opposition lawmakers. Mr. Trudeau initially said the allegations were false. Ms. Wilson-Raybould quit her post heading veterans affairs five days later.\n\nAt the urging of the opposition parties, members of Canada\u2019s parliamentary justice committee agreed Feb. 13 to hear testimony from certain witnesses about the allegations. Those hearings officially ended March 19 after the Liberal majority on the committee voted to cease calling witnesses and hear additional testimony, arguing Canadians possessed the information required. Ms. Wilson-Raybould submitted the recording as additional evidence.\n\nIn April, Mr. Trudeau expelled Ms. Wilson-Raybould from his party\u2019s caucus, saying trust had been broken by the recorded phone call. Mr. Wernick in March announced his retirement from the civil service, citing fallout from the uproar.\n\nA judge ruled on May 29 the case against SNC-Lavalin could head to trial. On June 11, the company said Mr. Bruce would retire immediately.\n\nIn a LinkedIn note, he said his family had moved \u201cand I was keen to join them.\u201d\n\nMs. Wilson-Raybould is running for re-election, as an independent lawmaker.\n\n\u2014Robert Hiltz in Montreal contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com and Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "description": "Revelations about the Canadian prime minister\u2019s advocacy for SNC-Lavalin, which faces fraud allegations, threaten his party\u2019s majority in October elections.", "authors": ["Kim Mackrael In Montreal", "Paul Vieira In Ottawa", "Kim Mackrael", "Paul Vieira", "Kim.Mackrael Wsj.Com", "Paul.Vieira Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-95139/social", "published_at": "2019-08-02"}
