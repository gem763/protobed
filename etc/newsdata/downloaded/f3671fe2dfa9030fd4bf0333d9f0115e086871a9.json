But his task won't be made any easier by the tricky retail backdrop.'", "description": "Julian Dunkerton, the founder of Superdry, has returned to head the fashion firm after jumping back into the helm in April on an interim basis.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
