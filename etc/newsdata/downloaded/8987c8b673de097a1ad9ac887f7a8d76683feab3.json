Lam invoked British colonial powers to enact the ban, using the city\u2019s Emergency Regulations Ordinance (ERO) for the first time in half a century.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government, controlled by the Communist Party of Beijing, insists that the protest movement is violent and requires extreme measures to subdue. The protest movement \u2013 a loosely organized pro-democracy coalition that has attracted nearly 2 million people of the 7 million living in Hong Kong to its biggest marches \u2013 insist on using peaceful means to make their five demands to the government. Lam promised the withdrawal of a proposed law that would allow China to extradite anyone present in Hong Kong if the Communist Party desired it, yielding to one of the five demands.\n\nProtesters are also demanding the right to elect lawmakers, an independent investigation into police brutality, an end to the government calling protesters \u201crioters,\u201d and freedom for political prisoners.\n\nPolice brutality escalated to an unprecedented level on Tuesday, the 70th anniversary of the communist takeover of China, when an officer shot a teen protester in the chest, piercing his lung. The protesters, Tsang Chi-king, is reportedly in stable condition after surgery to repair the damage. The bullet missed his heart by three centimeters, according to reports from the city.\n\nLam blamed this violence on the protesters and said on Friday she hopes the mask ban will empower the police.\n\n\u201cThe decision to enact an anti-mask law is not easy one, but it is a necessary decision considering the situation today,\u201d Lam said at an event announcing the new law. \u201cIn the past four months, we\u2019ve seen that all protesters that have carried out vandalism have covered their face. They\u2019ve become more and more daring, so we believe the regulation on face covering is appropriate.\u201d\n\nLam insisted that the situation in Hong Kong \u201csatisfies this [ERO] requirement of endangering public order\u201d but that, despite satisfying the requirements of the state of emergency law, Hong Kong was \u201cnot in a state of emergency.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more and more young people take part in riots, we hope this new regulation would deter young protesters and keep them away from violence,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt is our objective to de-escalate the violence, but we are not absolutely sure violence would end. Government and law enforcement agencies are taking action. We appeal to society to help us end the violence.\u201d\n\nLam denied that she had discussed the law with senior Communist Party officials in Beijing, where she traveled Tuesday for its annual celebration of communism.\n\nThe new law prohibits all masks and face coverings, including paint, at \u201cillegal\u201d assemblies against the government, subject to a fine of HK$25,000 ($3,187.87). It allows for exceptions for medical or religious masks, or masks necessary during the regular course of some jobs, leaving the door open for Hong Kong residents to wear niqabs or surgical masks if they have been diagnosed with a communicable disease. The law bans both full and partial face covering.\n\nThe legislation took effect on Friday at midnight local time. Thousands took the streets wearing face masks in defiance of the law.\n\nLATEST: Protesters wearing masks fill the main roads of Hong Kong after the government announced a face mask ban pic.twitter.com/i2a27jnMR5 \u2014 Bloomberg TicToc (@tictoc) October 4, 2019\n\nThe law came into effect shortly after the Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP) reported that police broke records on tear gas usage on Tuesday, attempting to quell protests that would embarrass Beijing on its biggest holiday. Police reportedly fired 1,400 tear gas canisters and made 269 arrests, the most in one day. The victims imprisoned ranged from ages 12 to 71 \u2013 including 18-year-old Tsang, who faces charges of rioting and assaulting a police officer while recovering from his near-fatal gunshot wound.\n\nHong Kong protest groups and human rights organizations have condemned the ban.\n\nThe Civil Human Rights Front, one of the key organizations of the pro-democracy movement responsible for ensuring the legal paperwork for many protests is completed, issued a statement warning Lam that fully enacting a state of emergency would \u201cbe declaring the death of \u2018One Country, Two Systems,'\u201d the policy that keep China from imposing its communism on Hong Kong, \u201cand that Hong Kong is now a colony under Mainland Chinese rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the anti-mask law, once applied, will threaten personal safety and the freedoms of expression and religion. The primary reason for wearing masks and industrial respirators is for protection from tear gas,\u201d the group noted. \u201cIt is also a political gesture. Without carefully examining practicalities, such laws would also impede religious practices that are under the protection of the Basic Law.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International also condemned the measure.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another attempt by the Hong Kong government to deter protesters, who have so far been undaunted by unnecessary and excessive use of force and the threat of prosecution, from exercising their rights,\u201d Joshua Rosenzweig, Head of Amnesty International\u2019s East Asia Regional Office, said in a statement. \u201cIt is thanks to the climate of fear Hong Kong authorities have created that protesters feel the need to wear masks in the first place. This ban is especially worrying in a context where protesters fear arbitrary arrest, surveillance, and the indiscriminate use of tear gas and other projectiles.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam's first move since returning from a trip to Beijing was to ban individuals from wearing face coverings.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/masked-man-in-hong-kong-protest-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
