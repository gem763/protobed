Trump is trying to gaslight Americans by claiming, over and over again, that the smoking-gun evidence against him was actually a \u201cperfect\u201d phone call. He said it 12 times in brief Oval Office remarks Wednesday as Finnish President Sauli Niinisto quietly looked on, and four more times at their joint press conference that poor Niinisto had to endure as Trump went off the rails. He has said it repeatedly on Twitter, often in ALL CAPS. Since the rough transcript of the call was released last week, he\u2019s said it virtually whenever he\u2019s been within yelling distance of a microphone.\n\nThe most dishonest president we\u2019ve ever had wants you to believe him, not your lying eyes.\n\nGaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation in which victims are led to doubt the evidence of their senses and the soundness of their reason. The term was coined in the 1930s, deriving from the title of a British play, but the practice is as old as human history. Trump apparently fancies himself a master of it.\n\nHe understands that repetition is one of the keys to making people believe something that is patently untrue. That\u2019s what he does with the derisive nicknames he gives to those he sees as standing in his way. He did it with \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d Clinton, despite the complete absence of evidence that she had committed any crime. He does it with the \u201cfake news\u201d label he stamps on any story he doesn\u2019t like. By saying something over and over, he implants the message.\n\nTrump is trying to do the same thing now in a desperate \u2014 and probably hopeless \u2014 attempt to avoid going down in history as just the third U.S. president to be impeached. When the phone call is brought up, he doesn\u2019t want you to think \u201cabuse of power\u201d or \u201cextortion\u201d or \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d He wants you to think \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nTo a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Trump\u2019s only real talent, and it is a considerable one, is as an illusionist. He created the appearance of being one of the biggest developers in New York by getting his name plastered on a lot of buildings that other people own. He created the appearance of being a genius businessman by playing one on television. He created the appearance of being a mega-tycoon worth upwards of $10 billion by, according to financial sleuths, simply lying about his net worth.\n\nSo now, facing impeachment, Trump resorts to the one thing he knows how to do at an expert level: tell lies openly, brazenly and frequently enough to make some people believe him. He\u2019s going to keep saying there was nothing wrong with the phone call, although obviously there was. He\u2019s going to keep saying that Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, are \u201ccorrupt,\u201d even though there is not a shred of evidence to suggest this slander is true.\n\nHe\u2019s also going to continue to look for \u201cproof\u201d that Russia didn\u2019t really help him win the 2016 election, which clearly it did. That may have less to do with any communications strategy, however, and more to do with Trump\u2019s fragile ego.\n\nThe gaslighting won\u2019t work with the Democratic leadership in the House. Their outrage at the way Trump ignored U.S. national security interests and the will of Congress, in an attempt to leverage the production of dirt on a potential opponent in the coming election, is genuine. The president might be tempted to infer from Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s previous reluctance to utter the word \u201cimpeachment\u201d that she is halfhearted about the process she has now begun. If so, he doesn\u2019t know the woman he\u2019s dealing with.\n\nOver time, however, Trump can incrementally eat away at public opinion, which has shifted dramatically in favor of impeachment over the past week. That is why Pelosi and her lieutenants have to be purposeful, disciplined and vocal in countering Trump\u2019s message with one of their own.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though,\u201d Trump said to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the call. Those 10 words cut through all the fog Trump is trying to generate. Say them as often as you can, and say them loud.\n\nContact Washington Post Writers Group columnist Eugene Robinson at eugenerobinson@washpost.com.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president was an impeachable abuse of power.I repeat: President Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president was an impeachable abuse of power.Once again, President Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president was an impeachable abuse of power.No apologies for the redundancy.
