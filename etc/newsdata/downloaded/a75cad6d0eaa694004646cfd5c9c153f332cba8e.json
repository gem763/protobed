All it does is detects the user with the help of its Radar tech to unlock the phone instantly. When you strech your hands to use the phone, the radar chip will detect that and instantaneously turn the front camera on, unlocking the phone when it's in your hands, without even the need of pressing the power button.\n\nGoogle\n\nWhile the phone getting unlocked by twins or look-alikes is a very specific concern, there's another major flaw in the face unlock technology on Pixel 4. Reports have revealed that the face unlock feature gets easily unlocked even when your eyes are closed. So anyone who wants to gain access to your smartphone just needs to show your sleeping face and that's pretty much it.\n\nGoogle\n\nConsidering there is no fingerprint scanner on the phone, your next bet of securing the phone is using the dated pin/password-based method. We don't know if Google will be fixing this issue with future OTA updates or will this be the way it is supposed to be.\n\nWould you still buy a Pixel 4?
