The alliance will act as an independent body, and its revenue split will be determined according to the number of ads each company serves.\n\nThis is the latest example of publishers joining forces to compete against the duopoly to augment their brand safety with greater scale. Publishers are constantly looking for ways to gain some leverage over the duopoly \u2014 Facebook and Google \u2014 which hoards over 60% of total digital ad revenue, and alliances can serve them well. For example, last year, The Guardian, Telegraph, and News U.K. formed a similar alliance dubbed the \"Ozone Project,\" which reaches 42 million people \"across the UK's most trusted publishers.\"\n\nThe project has had success attracting brands seeking a premium, brand-safe environment: Advertisers like Dunelm, William Hill, and Jet2 are using Ozone for targeted ads. Collectively, Insider, BuzzFeed, and Group Nine offer 100 million subscribers \u2014 more than twice the reach of the UK alliance \u2014 with over a billion views across their video content. While this is nowhere near the reach of social giants, the US alliance could still see strong uptake among advertisers looking for a brand safe supplement to \u2014 or even replacement for \u2014 the duopoly.\n\nAlliances allow publishers to better compete for ad dollars without sacrificing their individual brands by merging. Last November BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Perretti floated the idea of merging with rival publishers to better compete with the duopoly. We've seen some merger-like activity since then \u2014 Group Nine and Vice have each been in talks to merge with Refinery29; In May, Vox Media folded Recode into Vox, the culmination of a previously more distanced partnership \u2014 but few deals have actually materialized.\n\nDespite a hesitance to directly merge, we've seen a strong spirit of collaboration between rival publishers. In addition to the new BuzzFeed-Group Nine-Insider alliance, BuzzFeed formed a separate alliance with Vice and Group Nine earlier this year to offer advertisers standardized metrics around their ad performance across social media. And in September seven publishers \u2014 including the Los Angeles Times and Gannett \u2014 banded together to convince Congress to afford them greater collective bargaining power against the duopoly, per Axios.\n\nIt's possible publishers view collaboration as a more desirable path to the same end that a merger would achieve \u2014 greater scale \u2014 because they won't have to navigate the slew of challenges mergers present, like legal concerns, leadership change, layoffs, and brand integrations.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
