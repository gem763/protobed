Here\u2019s a Common Sense Way to Do It", "language": "en", "text": "Greetings from the Dept. of Reasonable. Have you ever been to the Dept. of Reasonable? It\u2019s a sensible, practical place. Nothing too crazy happens here. One glass of wine. Bed by 10 p.m. Lots of comfy sweaters and corduroys. You may hear some Coldplay.\n\nI\u2019m writing from the Dept. of Reasonable to endorse what I see as a reasonable idea: the Fair Pay to Play Act, a bill that unanimously passed through the California legislature and awaits the signature of Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nYou may have heard about this. This concerns the whole \u201cname and likeness\u201d debate that\u2019s been kicking around college sports for a while now. The bill would empower California college athletes to make money off their name, image and likeness\u2014something currently prohibited by the NCAA.\n\nWant to enlist an agent to seek money-making opportunities? Want to get paid to sign autographs at an autograph show? Have you been offered a commercial for a local car dealer? Come on down to the Cathedral of Convertibles! The California bill would stop the NCAA from penalizing an athlete that does this, and isn\u2019t limited to financial powerhouses like football and men\u2019s basketball. Men\u2019s and women\u2019s athletes in all sports would be permitted to benefit.\n\nThe NCAA is freaking, naturally, but this is not the End of College Sports As We Know It. The bill\u2014due to go into effect in 2023\u2014represents a sensible step toward financial fairness, without the myriad hurdles of schools paying college athletes directly.\n\nMen\u2019s and women\u2019s athletes in all sports would be permitted to benefit. Photo: Image Of Sport/Zuma Press\n\nBy now, we\u2019re all familiar with the multibillion-dollar marketplace of college athletics, especially in football and men\u2019s basketball, and the awkward construct of an economy in which every party (the coach, the school, the conference) is taking home a piece of the action, except one: the athlete actually playing the game.\n\nThe bill is not a radical maneuver. It does not mean schools would start paying college athletes. It would not flood rosters with cash\u2014the largest outside-income opportunities would likely go to the highest-profile athletes, who are already used as uncompensated marketing tools for their sports.\n\nThe bill simply lifts a ban that never really made much sense to begin with, and has been endangered ever since Ed O\u2019Bannon\u2019s case against the NCAA over his name and image being used in a videogame. Why shouldn\u2019t a college athlete have the opportunity to make money on his or her own likeness? Anyone else on campus is afforded this opportunity. A student on a piano scholarship is not prohibited from taking a paid gig at a wedding.\n\nThe California bill was even amended to alleviate concerns about branding conflicts between athletes and colleges\u2014an athlete would not be able to enter a deal that jeopardizes a school\u2019s existing sponsorships, i.e., a player getting paid to wear Brand Y sneakers on the court of a school sponsored by Brand X.\n\nThe historical roadblock, of course, is the graying concept of amateurism, which, depending whom you talk to, is either the special sauce of college sports, or a convenient device that allows students to be exploited and not categorized as employees. There are plenty of people inside and outside college sports who still feel a scholarship, even a partial one, is sufficient, and any further step toward \u201cprofessionalization\u201d would be detrimental to the product.\n\nThat was the vibe of a recent viral interview on ESPN with the former Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow, who now assists in the network\u2019s college football coverage, and fears steps to compensate athletes would turn it \u201cinto the NFL.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know we live in a selfish culture while it\u2019s all about us, but we\u2019re just adding and piling on to that where it changes what\u2019s special about college football,\u201d Tebow said. \u201cThat\u2019s why people are more passionate about college football than they are the NFL.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d never question Tebow\u2019s fervor for college sports\u2014he was one of the most electric college players ever\u2014but there\u2019s something amusing about someone employed by ESPN, which pays many millions for rights to college games, inveighing against the incursion of money. Tebow is presumably being paid to talk about college sports at ESPN. He was at the University of Florida when his coach, Urban Meyer, signed a $24 million extension. Did that diminish the public\u2019s passion for college sports?\n\n\u201cProfessionalization\u201d may be a fear-mongering word for college sports nostalgists, but professionalization is already here. Everyone\u2019s familiar with the big numbers, like the billions in media rights for college events like March Madness. There are college teams with facilities that rival\u2014or exceed\u2014the ones used by their idols in the NFL and NBA. Those absurd videos of college teams gratefully running around lavish new locker rooms send a conflicted message on amateurism. The money\u2019s everywhere.\n\nAs for the NCAA, there\u2019s been some saber-rattling about bans from national title games, or other fallout, should California go ahead with the bill. There are certain to be legal challenges, and there\u2019s concern that a bill such as this may present a hurdle to interstate commerce. The NCAA itself has been exploring changes to the name/image/likeness rules\u2014Condoleezza Rice, who chaired a recent reform commission on college basketball, signaled her openness to the idea\u2014and they do not seem thrilled to be beaten to the opportunity.\n\nBut the ball is rolling here. Other states are exploring name/image/likeness bills; California\u2019s is the furthest down the road. This week a bill was introduced in New York that would permit the use of name, image and likeness while also requiring colleges to give 15% of revenue to athletes.\n\nAre there unseen roadblocks? Probably. Could it get messy? Absolutely. Could outside sources of income create a whole new tool in recruitment, and alter the competitive landscape, as Washington State football coach Mike Leach cautioned the other day in a news conference. (Leach also suggested California should probably prioritize street cleaning.) Perhaps. I already feel like I\u2019m watching Alabama and Clemson in the title game every year, so maybe we\u2019re already there.\n\nThis is not the End of It All. This feels logical. Here at the Dept. of Reasonable, we believe it\u2019s too reasonable not to try.\n\nWrite to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com", "description": "A California bill allowing athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness wouldn\u2019t be the end of the games fans love, writes Jason Gay.", "authors": ["Jason Gay", "Jason.Gay Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108676/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
