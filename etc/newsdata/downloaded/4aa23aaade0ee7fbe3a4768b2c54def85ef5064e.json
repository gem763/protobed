I\u2019m just not standing at this election.\u201d\n\nHer ally and friend Health Secretary Matt Hancock had called for her to be allowed in.\n\nMs Rudd had faced having to stand as an Independent after she quit the Cabinet and Tory whip last month to protest at Boris Johnson \u2019s push for no-deal Brexit .\n\nThe chief whip told her she would not be allowed back into the fold in case she turned on the Prime Minister again.\n\nHe told her \u201creceipt of the whip is an honour, not a right and it cannot be discarded or returned at will.\u201d\n\nShe insisted the PM asked her to stand \u201cjust last week\u201d in the upcoming poll.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nShe said she \u201crespects the decision he had been asked to make\u201d \u2013 even though it means she won\u2019t be allowed the whip back. Ms Rudd resigned in solidarity with 21 of her colleagues who were sacked from for voting to prevent a no-deal Brexit in September.\n\n\"Of those ten have now been offered the whip again. But 11 remain outside of the party.\"\n\nTwo MPs Sam Gyimah and Phillip Lee crossed the floor to join the Liberal Democrats .\n\nAntoinette Sandbach has said she will stand as an independent candidate in Eddisbury, campaigning for a referendum and Remain - and there was no offer to her to restore Conservative party whip.\n\nFormer Chancellor Philip Hammond has ramped up his criticism of the PM in recent days including saying that the real reason for the election was to purge the Conservative party of moderates like him.\n\nWhen asked if he wanted the Conservatives to win the next election, Mr Hammond told the BBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI\u2019ve been a member of the Conservative Party for 40 years and I\u2019m agonising over this.\n\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter how many times my party kicks me, abuses me, reviles me, they\u2019re not going to stop me feeling like a Conservative.\n\n\u201cI believe that my view of the world, my approach to what the Conservative Party should be, a party that stands for sound government, solid economic management, responsible fiscal management, I believe that that is where the Conservative Party has to be in the future and I\u2019m not ready to give up fighting for the soul of the Conservative Party.\u201d\n\nFormer Tory Attorney General Dominic Grieve is also standing as an Independent but the Liberal Democrats are standing aside for him in Beaconsfield.\n\nGeneral election 2019 countdown UK goes to polls in 0 Days 0 Hours 0 minutes 0 Seconds\n\nAsked about the influence the group of Independents might have, he said: \u201cI have no idea what influence we may have on this campaign.\n\n\u201cAll I can do is go out to my electorate and say these are my beliefs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Conservative obviously.\n\n\u201cI think the direction which the party is going in is wrong.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Rory Stewart is quitting to stand to be London Mayor.\n\nExplaining his decision, he said: \u201cThis is not just about a movement away from national politics to local politics; it\u2019s not just about what I would like to do for you in London, which is make you feel safer, make your commute better, make your housing more affordable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually about democracy itself.\u201d", "description": "She joined a raft of women leaving parliament citing abuse and the pressures of the job on their mental health or family.", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett", "Oliver Milne", "Image", "Afp", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12694436.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Pre-Budget-cabinet-meeting-at-Downing-Street.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
