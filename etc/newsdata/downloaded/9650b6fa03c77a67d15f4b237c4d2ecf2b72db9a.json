The editorial team made clear they do not control \u201cthe ad experience,\u201d and acknowledged that many readers had been critical of the way the ads appeared on the site.\n\nWhen asked for comment by The Daily Beast, a G/O Media spokesperson said the company does not comment on advertising partnerships. According to the Wall Street Journal, the company\u2019s ad-operations team did not believe the sites could deliver on the impressions promised to Farmers, and decided to autoplay the ads before videos after failing to hit the ad goals.\n\nMultiple sources confirmed to The Daily Beast that following the editorial team\u2019s public criticism of the ads, Farmers informed G/O that it would not continue with the campaign which, according to the Journal, was worth $1 million and required the media company to deliver nearly 43.5 million ad impressions through next year.\n\nManagement eventually decided to remove the critical posts, causing an even greater uproar among staff and readers.\n\n\u201cThe GMG Union has been informed that posts across our websites asking for reader feedback on an autoplay ad campaign were taken down by management. We condemn this action in the strongest possible terms,\u201d the company\u2019s editorial union wrote Monday in a tweet.\n\nFarmers\u2019 advertising removal comes amid increasing friction between G/O staff\u2014particularly at Deadspin\u2014and their new executive managers.\n\nG/O Media was formed earlier this year when private equity firm Great Hill Partners bought Gizmodo Media, the collection of former Gawker Media websites, from Univision.\n\nIn the months since the acquisition, new management has clashed with many editorial staffers over some of the sites\u2019 editorial direction. Earlier this year, Deadspin\u2019s former editor in chief left the site after G/O brass ordered her to halt publishing stories that did not have a sports angle.\n\nAnd this week, the company\u2019s CEO fired Deadspin\u2019s deputy editor after the site refused to hew to the new \u201cstick to sports\u201d mandate.", "description": "The ads were axed after G/O Media staffers at Deadspin and other sites spoke out against irritating autoplay ads\u2014yet another battle in the ongoing feud between execs and editorial.", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572451028/191030-tani-go-farmers-tease_db7q0x", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
