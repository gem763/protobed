At the same time Congress ponders whether to have an impeachment or an election here in the US, the Mother Country\u2019s mulling over the same conundrum in Westminster. After a unanimous decision by the UK\u2019s top court slapped down Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to sideline Parliament, some members are talking about the I-word. And it doesn\u2019t help that the prime minister once attempted to impeach Tony Blair, either:\n\nPlaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster Leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said opposition party leaders should be ready to impeach Boris Johnson if he failed to request an extension to article 50 to avoid a no-deal Brexit. She said: \u201cBoris Johnson has already driven a bulldozer through the constitution, so no longer are ideas like impeachment far-fetched. I will tell other opposition party leaders, we need to be ready to impeach Boris Johnson if he breaks the law.\u201d In 2004, Boris Johnson supported an attempt to impeach Tony Blair over the Iraq war, co-signing a motion tabled by current Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price. Writing in a column for The Telegraph at the time, Johnson said that Blair deserved to be impeached because he had \u201ctreated parliament and the public with contempt\u201d.\n\nOof. Blair may have arguably treated Parliament with contempt in regard to the Iraq War, but at least he never convinced the Queen to prorogue it to prevent it from interfering in operations. Expect to hear a lot about geese, ganders, and sauce over the next day or two.\n\nThat may not be the only issue that Britons will hear about after Parliament resumes its work early tomorrow. A new scandal involving Johnson during his time as mayor of London has his opposition \u201csmelling blood in the water,\u201d and perhaps multiple potential opportunities to oust the prime minister:\n\nIn an article published this weekend, The Sunday Times of London reported that, when Mr. Johnson was mayor of London, his office directed tens of thousands of pounds in government money to a fledgling entrepreneur and close friend whose apartment he often visited during working hours. The entrepreneur, Jennifer Arcuri, an American and a former model, was 27 when she first crossed paths with Mr. Johnson in 2012. In the ensuing years, she was given coveted spots on trade missions with the mayor to Tel Aviv, New York, Singapore and Malaysia. In some instances, Mr. Johnson\u2019s office intervened to add her to the roster even though she did not meet the criteria for trade delegates, The Sunday Times reported. \u2026 On a plane to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Johnson repeatedly refused to answer reporters\u2019 questions about the article, including whether he was in a sexual relationship with Ms. Arcuri at the time. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, accused the prime minister of an \u201calleged abuse of power.\u201d And the British Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which this year awarded Ms. Arcuri\u2019s company a grant of 100,000 pounds, or about $125,000, intended for British firms, said it was investigating the grant after The Sunday Times reported that Ms. Arcuri had vacated the company\u2019s registered address in England and now lives in California.\n\nFor his part, Johnson says the \u201cobvious solution is to have an election,\u201d while accusing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn of \u201ctalking out the back of his neck\u201d:\n\n\"Jeremy Corbyn is talking out of the back of his neck and he should have an election\", Boris Johnson tells reporters New York. pic.twitter.com/z1zcvj7L6G \u2014 Philip Sime (@PhilipSime) September 24, 2019\n\nComing on the heels of the court\u2019s slapdown and a new emerging scandal, this might not be the most propitious time for an election for Tories, either. A snap poll from YouGov shows that Brits aren\u2019t terribly happy about the prorogation of Parliament, with a near-majority siding with the courts to reopen Westminster, via The Guardian:\n\nThe Supreme Court have said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully in proroguing Parliament. Do you agree or disagree with the ruling?\n\nAgree \u2013 49%\n\nDisagree \u2013 30%https://t.co/MUEKclvlUK pic.twitter.com/6XZuJ1rHIU \u2014 YouGov (@YouGov) September 24, 2019\n\nJohnson still gets majority support within his own party and with Leavers, but mid-50s is probably a lot lower than Johnson needs. Everyone else overwhelmingly agrees with the court, and if that has any indication how a national vote would go, Johnson and the Tories would be in very big trouble.\n\nStill, impeachment and prorogation are both attempts to avoid the main issue. Johnson may have his own motives for this, but he\u2019s correct that this kind of a standoff in a parliamentary system should be resolved by an election, not an impeachment and not another referendum either. If Johnson wanted to take an honest approach to this point, he\u2019d arrange for another short delay in Article 50 to conduct an election to settle where British voters stand on the potential no-deal Brexit. The Tories should have called for such an election when they rejected Theresa May\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement three times this spring.\n\nThus far no one\u2019s budging on their previous position on triggering an election on a no-confidence vote, but Johnson will make another push for it now that Parliament has reopened. If he\u2019s reading the tea leaves correctly, Johnson thinks that Conservatives can win an outright majority in elections based on their hard-line approach to Brexit. If he can, Johnson might be able to fall back to the Northern Ireland-only backstop that the EU first proposed to deal with the border in Ireland, once he no longer has to depend on DUP for his majority. If a 90-day delay gets Johnson his elections, will that be too costly a compromise?", "description": "Impeachment II: British Boogaloo?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/johnson-election.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
