She\u2019s a billionaire, she can do what she likes: the rest of us just exist in a world controlled by people like her. They own so many parts of our lives, so why shouldn\u2019t they also own the cheery soundbites that are designed to smooth over psychic pain like a slick swish of buttercream?\n\nJenner made the application last week after a video snippet of her singing the phrase to her baby daughter went viral. And as a quite new mother myself, I get it \u2013 if I could monetise the version of I\u2019ve Been Working On the Railroad that I sing to my little boy when he\u2019s screaming in the car, I absolutely would. But the commercial power of those three little words also demonstrates how much we cling to aphorisms in this age of anxiety. Why talk about your actual feelings when there\u2019s a hashtag for them?\n\nStruggling to afford to balance full-time work and childcare? You got this!\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just a self-protective instinct: nothing says \u201cI\u2019m not actually interested in your clinical depression and existential angst\u201d more than a $65 \u201crise and shine\u201d sweatshirt. Jenner\u2019s catchphrase is just one of many relentlessly upbeat diktats being batted around these days. Much like \u201cKeep calm and carry on\u201d, today\u2019s aphoristic exhortations insist that we ignore grim realities and continue our pursuit of narrow self-interest, with a dash of hopelessness.\n\nConsider the phrase \u201cYou got this!\u201d It is something I rarely heard before becoming a mother, but from the day I gave birth I noticed that people \u2013 mostly well-meaning \u2013 had adapted this as the go-to phrase in response to women expressing their fears and concerns about the trials of dealing with a newborn, a six-month-old, a teen. It peppers in-person conversation and, even more so, every online space where you see new mothers yearning to be heard and helped.\n\n\u201cYou got this\u201d is intended to be an empowering encouragement to a mother who worries that she hasn\u2019t mastered feeding or changing or entertaining her child, but it also ends the conversation. The implication is that \u201cit\u2019s all on you\u201d, despite the fact that so many challenges of parenthood are beyond the parent\u2019s control. Struggling to balance full-time work and childcare because the cost of the latter is barely covered by the former? You got this! Overwhelmed by a child who only sleeps for an hour at a time before requiring milk while you try to get enough sleep ahead of your 12-hour shift? You got this! Desperately afraid that your child is going to reach adulthood just in time for an apocalypse? You got this! \u201cYou got this\u201d is what we say when someone wants to hear \u201cI\u2019m here to help\u201d but we don\u2019t actually have time to say it, or any help to offer (or interest in helping). What if you haven\u2019t got this? Well, you\u2019ll still be told that you do, until you either come to believe it or stop sharing your feelings.\n\nThe dark art of copyright: trademark battles from Specsavers to Facebook Read more\n\n\u201cBe the change\u201d is another one \u2013 tagged on Instagram, the beating heart of all of our anxiety, a chilling 4.6m times. It\u2019s shorthand for \u201cBe the change you wish to see\u201d, and like these other upbeat phrases it seems to stem from good intentions. But again it thrusts the responsibility for big problems on the individual, not the powerful. It\u2019s a cheerful way of telling someone to get their own house in order before they dare levy criticism elsewhere. Don\u2019t bother coming out to a climate protest against the corporations that cause the vast majority of global emissions if you\u2019ve ever drunk from a paper cup or eaten a hamburger.\n\nWhat if the change you don\u2019t want to see is the departure from your country from the European Union? Too bad. \u201cGet ready for Brexit\u201d is surely the most meaningless exhortation of them all. Get ready for what? How? When? No matter. Rise and shine! You got this.\n\n\u2022 Jean Hannah Edelstein is a freelance journalist and author in New York", "description": "Like other upbeat insta-phrases, \u2018rise and shine\u2019 is a crude instruction to ignore our feelings, says the New York-based journalist Jean Hannah Edelstein", "authors": ["Jean Hannah Edelstein"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d008177f87808e523766c02c150adcaeff160c91/0_121_3054_1833/master/3054.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2837a5797262ee95e556b897eab36c06", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
