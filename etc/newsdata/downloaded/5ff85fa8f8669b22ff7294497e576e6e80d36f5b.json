All the votes against it were from Future Forward.\n\nKing Vajiralongkorn has moved to consolidate his personal authority since taking the throne in 2016.\n\nIn July 2017, the military-appointed legislative assembly amended a 1936 law to give the king full control of the Crown Property Bureau, which manages the crown's multi-billion dollar holdings.\n\nPublic criticism of the king or his family is illegal in Thailand, with insults to the monarchy punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
