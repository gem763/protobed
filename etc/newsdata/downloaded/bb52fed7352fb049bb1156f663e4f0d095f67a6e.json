REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday he and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He for talks in early October, while clarifying that the Trump administration had requested Chinese officials to cancel the farming trip last Friday.\n\nNews of the cancellation had caused a sharp pullback in U.S. stocks on the day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much that people have become positive on (trade talks), but had taken the cancellation as a sign that the deal was in trouble, and now the administration seems to be suggesting that it\u2019s not,\u201d said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.\n\n\u201cThe market seems to be in a pretty tight range, while they await some more concrete news about the China situation.\u201d\n\nThe trade-sensitive Philadelphia chip index .SOX gained 0.61%. The broader technology sector .SPLRCT rose 0.79%, with iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) providing the biggest support.\n\nApple gained 1.3% after Jefferies assumed coverage with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating, citing the company\u2019s potential in the 5G cycle.\n\nEven as trade talks remain the primary focus, investors will also watch out for the Conference Board\u2019s U.S. consumer confidence reading for September that is expected to come in at 133.5, from a reading of 135.1 in August. The report is due at 10:00 a.m. ET (1400 GMT).\n\nData due later this week, which includes the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge for inflation, will also offer insights into U.S. economic health ahead of the third-quarter earnings season and the central bank\u2019s policy meeting in October.\n\n\u201cMarkets are in this delicate period where investors don\u2019t want too much acceleration because they are concerned that it will put an end to low interest rates but they also don\u2019t want enough slowing to impact corporate profits,\u201d Cherry Lane\u2019s Meckler said.\n\nAt 9:37 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 97.17 points, or 0.36%, at 27,047.16, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 11.12 points, or 0.37%, at 3,002.90. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 34.89 points, or 0.43%, at 8,147.35.\n\nTen of the 11 major S&P sub-indexes were higher, with only the energy sector .SPNY marginally lower.\n\nVideo streaming platform Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) fell 2.1% after Pivotal Research cut its price target.\n\nNike Inc (NKE.N) rose 0.3%, ahead of the world\u2019s largest sportswear maker\u2019s first-quarter results after the bell.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.05-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.63-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 8 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 14 new highs and 16 new lows.", "description": "U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, lifted by technology shares, after Washington confirmed that trade talks with China would resume in two weeks, easing some uncertainty fueled by the cancellation of a planned U.S. farm visit by Chinese delegates last week.", "authors": ["Ambar Warrick", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433318677&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0YF", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
