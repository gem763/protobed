Here are some of the biggest things that set Southwest Airlines apart from other carriers. USA TODAY\n\nSouthwest Airlines is extending its flight schedule revisions involving grounded Boeing 737 Max aircraft into February 2020.\n\nIn a press release Thursday, the airline said it is continuing to monitor information from Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\n\"With the timing of the Max\u2019s return-to-service still uncertain, we are extending the Max-related flight schedule adjustments through Feb. 8, 2020,\" the statement read.\n\nSouthwest previously revised its flight schedule by removing the Max through Jan. 5.\n\nBy proactively extending the flight schedule revisions, the airline hopes to reduce \"last-minute flight cancellations and unexpected disruptions\" for travelers.\n\nSouthwest, American and United have been rebooking flights since the plane was grounded March 13 following two fatal crashes in less than five months that killed 346 people.\n\nThe timetable for the plane's recertification by the FAA and return to service is still unclear, forcing airlines to scramble to remove it from their schedules and put passengers on other flights.\n\nSouthwest is the largest U.S. operator of the Max, with 34 of the planes at the time of the grounding. American had 24, and United had 14.\n\nBoeing 737 Max: How many of those planes fly for Southwest, American, United, and where?\n\nUnited took the plane out of its schedule through Dec. 19, ahead of the peak Christmas/New Year's travel rush. And American said it was extending Max cancellations through Jan. 16.\n\nWhat if your flight will be affected?\n\nSouthwest says customers who already booked flights that will be affected by the amended schedule will be notified of \"re-accommodated travel.\"\n\n\"The revision will proactively remove roughly 175 weekday flights from our schedule out of our total peak-day schedule of more than 4,000 daily flights,\" the statement said.\n\nContributing: Dawn Gilbertson\n\nBoeing 737 Max fallout: How an 8 a.m. nonstop turned into an evening flight with a stop\n\nCheck your flight: American removes 737 Max from schedule through holiday travel rush\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2019/10/17/southwest-airlines-extends-boeing-737-max-cancellations-february-8/4006744002/", "description": "Southwest Airlines is extending its flight schedule revisions involving Boeing 737 Max\u00a0aircrafts through February 2020.", "authors": ["Sara M Moniuszko", "Published A.M.
