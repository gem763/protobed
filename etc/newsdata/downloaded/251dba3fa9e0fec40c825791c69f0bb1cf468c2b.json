George\u2019s police lieutenant indicted on second-degree sex offense charge in off-duty incident", "language": "en", "text": "A Prince George\u2019s County police lieutenant was indicted Tuesday on a second-degree sex offense charge in connection with an incident in 2017, prosecutors said.\n\nPrince George\u2019s police and the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office said they have been investigating allegations that Lt. Richard Tallant sexually assaulted a woman he knew while he was off duty in February 2017.\n\nTallant, who has been with the department since 1997 and is assigned to the narcotics enforcement division, was suspended this April when county police learned of the allegations, police said.\n\nThe charge stems from a social outing in Upper Marlboro two years ago with a woman he was familiar with, police said.\n\nAfter learning of the allegation, police began an investigation and brought the case to prosecutors for review, police said.\n\nPrince George\u2019s State\u2019s Attorney Aisha Braveboy (D) said that she could not detail the nature of the relationship between Tallant and the victim but that prosecutors with her office\u2019s public integrity unit thought it was appropriate to charge him and bring the case to a grand jury.\n\n\u201cWhen we find there are matters where an officer has committed a crime, our job is to at least investigate the allegations and determine whether or not there is truth,\u201d Braveboy said. \u201cIf so, that unit is charged with moving forward to prosecute those individuals.\u201d\n\nTallant, who is suspended without pay, could not immediately be reached for comment, and online court records did not list an attorney for him.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The charge stems from a social outing two years ago with a woman he knew, police said.", "authors": ["Lynh Bui", "Reporter Focusing On Public Safety", "Criminal Justice"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1Plrf8psS0Hq9ZxXQVaVnFcLXqQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M7ENUKHFT4I6NJKHL64UCHJTFQ.jpg"}
