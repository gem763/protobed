Hohn, a former U.S. Air Force colonel. Hohn was carrying nonmetallic pellets used in low-power replica air guns in a checked bag and cannot leave China pending the outcome of his investigation, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nHohn is out on bail and under criminal investigation for smuggling ammunition, Geng said Friday.\n\nChina has some of the world\u2019s strictest gun-control regulations and even many Chinese are not aware of draconian rules governing replica airsoft weapons, which fire pellets that can leave bruises but are seldom deadly. Chinese state media in 2016 covered the case of a man in Fujian province who was bewildered when he was given life imprisonment after ordering 24 replica guns from the Internet.\n\nChina confirms detention of Australian writer Yang Hengjun on suspicion of endangering national security\n\nHohn\u2019s case adds another pressure point for FedEx in China, where the company faces serious political risks. Chinese officials have opened investigations into the express service since June, and state media have suggested the company could be placed on a blacklist of \u201cunreliable\u201d foreign firms after Huawei, the Chinese technology giant, accused FedEx of misrouting parcels and potential foul play.\n\nChina\u2019s proposed unreliable-entities list appeared to be a response to Washington\u2019s decision to ban U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei after the U.S. government added the Chinese technology firm to a Commerce Department blacklist.\n\nU.S. blacklisting of Huawei prompts European firms to follow suit\n\nFedEx said this week that its business outlook for the year has darkened dramatically amid the U.S.-China trade dispute.\n\nChinese authorities have been investigating FedEx in recent weeks for illegally shipping weapons, including knives, to Hong Kong, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency. FedEx has said the package containing knives never left its origin city \u2014 coincidentally, Guangzhou.\n\nAll summer, China has accused the United States of covertly fomenting protests and violence in Hong Kong, but has not provided substantial evidence.\n\nHohn, who left the Air Force in 2017, had passed through security and was waiting in an executive lounge for a Cathay Dragon flight home to Hong Kong when he was detained, the Journal reported.\n\nA protracted investigation into Hohn could add strain to bilateral relations at a time when Western countries, including Canada, Australia and the United States, have accused China of seizing foreign nationals on murky or trumped-up charges to apply political pressure to their governments.\n\nAustralia asks why Chinese authorities detained one of its citizens in potential new diplomatic row\n\nChina accuses two detained Canadians of stealing state secrets\n\nChina confirms detention of Australian writer Yang Hengjun on suspicion of endangering national security\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The case against Todd A.
