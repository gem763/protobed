(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nFor the second time in two games of this best-of-five WNBA semifinal series, the Washington Mystics had to do something against the Las Vegas Aces they are not accustomed to: defend \u2014 truly defend \u2014 their home court at Entertainment and Sports Arena with a level of ferocity and heart they hadn\u2019t previously had to show until these clutch moments.\n\nOn Thursday, it wasn\u2019t just a double-digit run from the Aces in the fourth quarter that posed a problem for Washington, as it did in Game 1 on Tuesday. In Game 2, Washington staved off a big run at the end of the first half and another incursion in the fourth to hold on for a 103-91 win and take a 2-0 lead as the series heads to Las Vegas for Game 3 on Sunday.\n\n\u201cObviously, a game of some interesting runs,\u201d Mystics Coach and General Manager Mike Thibault said. \u201cA lot of teams that have not been through this before would have been in a tough shape mentally at halftime. We gave up the run right before halftime, and yet there was no sense of disaster among those players. We traded baskets for the first couple minutes of the second half, and then we got going.\u201d\n\n[The inaugural Mystics seldom won. Now, they think it\u2019s their time.]\n\nThe Mystics\u2019 regular season, full of blowouts and straightforward wins, is a memory. On Thursday, Washington had to work to salvage momentum in the third quarter and did so thanks to another dominant stretch from Emma Meesseman \u2014 the forward who had a similarly successful third quarter in Game 1.\n\nShe had 13 points in the period Tuesday; in Game 2, she had 11 points in the third and finished with a game-high 30 points, which tied a career high for the 6-foot-4 Belgian.\n\n\u201cWe know what not to do against Meesseman,\u201d Aces guard Kelsey Plum said when asked what the team could take from these first two games.\n\nMeesseman had plenty of help; five other Mystics scored in double figures, including Natasha Cloud (18 points) and LaToya Sanders (17). Elena Delle Donne, named league MVP for the second time in her career earlier Thursday, chipped in 14 points and 10 rebounds. Aerial Powers had 10 points. Kristi Toliver had 10 as well, seven of which came in the fourth quarter.\n\nSanders, the team\u2019s 6-foot-2 center, had the added task of wrangling 6-8 Liz Cambage on defense. The Aces center led her team with 23 points and 10 rebounds, but Sanders kept her under wraps for large swaths of the second and fourth quarters. Sanders also had three crucial blocks on defense.\n\n[Meditations on an MVP season: Elena Delle Donne thrives with new approach]\n\n\u201cI just take what the defense gives me. My job is probably the easiest on the team, because when they\u2019re doubling on Elena or Emma, my job is basically to get wide-open jumpers and layups,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m pretty sure I can do those two things . . . defensively, Cambage is a talent, she\u2019s a big girl, so I just do what I can to just try to make it difficult for her. I know she\u2019s going to make some buckets here and there, but I just try to dish it out as much as I take it.\u201d\n\nPlum, playing point guard instead of shooting guard as she did during the regular season, had 19 points. Jackie Young added 13.\n\nBut it was the Aces\u2019 defense that stood out in the second quarter.\n\nLas Vegas made smart switches to create mismatches, erasing a 10-point deficit. The Aces took an edge early in the third before Meesseman tied the game at 57 with a three-pointer at the top of the key.\n\nFrom there, the teams went back and forth before Delle Donne put the Mystics up 65-64 with just over four minutes left in the period and Meesseman won a key jump ball on the other end to give possession back to Washington, then dished a sharp pass to Sanders in the middle of the lane who completed a three-point play to put the Mystics up 71-64. Toliver capped the sequence with a deep corner three in front of Vegas Coach Bill Laimbeer, bringing her hand to her ear, readying for cheers, before the ball even swished through the net.\n\n[Svrluga: Elena Delle Donne, the WNBA\u2019s MVP, is right at home with the Mystics]\n\nWashington had its 10-point lead back with 1:45 left in the quarter and was never seriously threatened after that, though Las Vegas got within eight midway through the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cThey capitalize on everything that you do,\u201d Plum said.\n\nThe Mystics did well keeping Las Vegas close in the competition on the boards, gaining 28 rebounds to the Aces\u2019 35, and just as critically, the free throw attempts were close as well: Washington edged Las Vegas there, 20-19. Those two factors were nearly as key as Meesseman\u2019s shooting, Delle Donne\u2019s rebounds and Sanders\u2019s overall performance.\n\n\u201cWe got contributions from a lot of people, obviously Kristi had a great fourth quarter \u2014 little by little, it\u2019s looking like the Kristi Toliver that we all know \u2014 I thought Aerial Powers gave us a huge lift tonight, and we just did what we were supposed to do,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cWe held serve. The next game will be the hardest game so far.\u201d", "description": "Emma Meesseman scores 30 as Washington heads to Las Vegas needing one win to return to the finals.", "authors": ["Ava Wallace", "Reporter Covering Local Colleges", "September At Pm", "Ava Wallace Covers College Sports With A Focus On Georgetown", "Navy", "Maryland", "As Well As Tennis", "The Wnba For The Washington Post.
