Bill Pascrell of New Jersey tweeted that the photo showed Pelosi \"speaking out against Trump's disgraces to his face and every man on his side looks down in shame.\"\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell added that the photo is \"definitely in the running for her Speaker portrait.\"\n\nTrump's tweet came after Pelosi accused Trump of having a \"meltdown\" in the meeting.\n\nShe and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who was also present, told reporters that Democrats walked out of the meeting as they were insulted instead of being provided with details of how to deal with the Syria crisis.\n\nPelosi also said Trump was \"shaken\" after the House vote in the meeting, The Hill reported.\n\n\"That's why we couldn't continue in the meeting because he just wasn't relating to the reality of it,\" she said. \"What we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown, sad to say.\"\n\n\"I pray for the president all the time, and I tell him that,\" she added, according to The Hill. \"I pray for his safety and that of his family. Now we have to pray for his health because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.\"\n\nRead more: A top senator says Trump's Syria retreat and the Ukraine scandal may have damaged America's credibility forever\n\nSchumer also revealed details of the meeting, telling The Hill that Trump was \"insulting\" to Pelosi but \"she kept her cool completely, but he called her a third-rate politician. [...] I mean, this was not a dialogue. It was sort of a diatribe, a nasty diatribe.\"\n\nTrump later tweeted a photo of Pelosi and Schumer during the meeting, captioning it: \"Do you think they like me?\"\n\nIn a separate tweet, he posted a photo of the meeting after Pelosi and Schumer walked out, calling them \"Do Nothing Democrats.\"", "description": "The photo was taken at a meeting after the House voted to condemn the US withdrawal from Syria.
