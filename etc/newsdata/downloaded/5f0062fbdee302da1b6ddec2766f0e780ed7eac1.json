She's asked me on more than one occasion, \"Mummy are you going to die?\"\n\n'I have no energy, I'm in pain all the time and I have no quality of life.\n\n'I\u2019ve become so weak as the years have gone on, my body simply can\u2019t hold my joints in place anymore.'\n\n'I was on crutches at first but I\u2019ve been using a wheelchair full-time for the past three years now.\n\nShe added: 'When I was pregnant with my daughter I had a very specific idea of how my life would be and it could not have been further from how it's turned out.\n\n'Me, my husband and daughter have all been hugely affected by this disease.'\n\nOne afternoon in April 2012, Mrs Evans-Lippett was lifting her daughter when she felt a 'burning pins and needles' sensation in her right hip.\n\nAfter days of trying to ease her pain with an ice pack, Mrs Evans-Lippett, who was now hobbling, visited her GP who gave her crutches and told her to come back in two weeks.\n\nUnfortunately, her symptoms intensified, and an MRI revealed Mrs Evans-Lippett had torn ligaments in her hip, which were making it semi-dislocate every day.\n\nIn September 2012 she was booked in for surgery to remove the loose tissue and correctly position her bones to prevent any further dislocating.\n\nBut, a week after the operation, her physiotherapist made a startling discovery.\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett, of Bridport, Dorset, was told she had Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), a genetic condition, in 2012 (pictured)\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett's condition began with an agonising hip which, despite an operation, would dislocate up to 20 times a day\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett said: 'I was working on getting movement back in my joints and I suddenly felt my hip pop again.\n\n'I didn't realise at the time, but it had fully dislocated and, thinking nothing of it, I just popped it back in. It wasn't comfortable, but I soon realised I could pop the joint in and out by myself.\n\n'As soon as the physio found out this was happening, he sent me right back to see my consultant.'\n\nWhen Mrs Evans-Lippett was referred to a specialist at University of Central London Hospital (UCLH), her right hip joint was dislocating up to 20 times a day.\n\nShe said: 'I'd always had \"clicky hips\" growing up, but I'd never thought anything of it.\n\n'Now, suddenly they were dislocating every day, sometimes every hour, and it left me in absolute agony.'\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett's parents, who she would rather not name, paid for a private appointment at UCLH in October 2012 so she could get some answers.\n\nAfter a thorough physical examination, she was diagnosed with EDS.\n\nThe group of genetic conditions affect the body\u2019s connective tissue keeping everything - bones, organs, and skin - together.\n\nThe prevalence of all types of EDS appears to be at least one in 5,000 individuals worldwide, according to the National Institute of Health.\n\nIt is difficult to determine the true figure, as those with mild joint and skin problems may be undiagnosed.\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett, who is cared for by her husband, Tony, 48, said: 'I can pull my thumbs down to my wrist, put my knee to the side and have one foot face forward and the other one back'\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett was given a permanent feeding tube that provided her with 1,000 calories a day. After losing weight, she said she has no energy or quality of life\n\nWHAT IS EHLERS -DANLOS SYNDROME? Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is the name for a group of rare inherited conditions that affect connective tissue. Research statistics of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes show the total prevalence as 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 5,000 people, according to charities. There are thirteen individual genetic conditions, all of which affect the body\u2019s connective tissue. Connective tissues provide support in skin, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, internal organs and bones. Depending on the type of EDS, the faulty gene may have been inherited from one parent, or both parents. Sometimes the faulty gene isn\u2019t inherited, but occurs in the person for the first time. EDS can affect people in different ways. For some the condition is relatively mild, while for others their symptoms can be disabling. Some of the rare severe types can be life-threatening. There are several types of EDS that may share some symptoms. These include an increased range of joint movement (joint hypermobility), stretchy skin and fragile skin that breaks or bruises easily.

If anything, the diagnosis spurred me on to do more while I could.'\n\nWhen her career as a singer songwriter was just kicking off in 2015, Mrs Evans-Lippett's health drastically deteriorated.\n\nA month after an album launch, Mrs Evans-Lippett was dealt a devastating blow when doctors said her bowel was failing to work.\n\nHypermobile EDS (hEDS), the most common type of EDS, causes problems with the digestive system and internal organs.\n\nThe muscles which push food along the digestive tract may malfunction, leading to issues such as acid reflux and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett said: 'My bowel suddenly stopped working, I wasn't able to go the toilet for months.\n\n'There was one doctor at our local hospital who had a proper understanding of EDS and he explained to me that the soft tissue in my bowel had stopped working and, as a result, it was sluggish and not working properly.'\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett was booked in for surgery in October 2015 to have an ileostomy bag fitted to collect her body waste.\n\n'A lot of people struggle psychologically with whole ileostomy thing, but I felt completely blessed,' she said.\n\n'The crippling stomach pain went and I was able to start eating again.'\n\nSadly, the relief did not last for long, because six months after her operation, Mrs Evans-Lippett started being sick after every meal.\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett said the worst thing about her condition is worrying her daughter, Amelia, 10, will also end up with it\n\nAmelia has asked her mother on more than one occasion, 'Mummy are you going to die?'\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett, who is 5ft 5, has a body mass index (BMI) of just 15.6. She is hoping to get total parenteral nutrition (TPN), it enables the body's daily requirement of nutrients to be fed through a catheter placed in a vein leading to the heart\n\nShe said: 'It was quite infrequent at first, every now and then I would throw up after a meal here or there but it immediately raised red flags.\n\n'As the weeks passed, I was being sick after every single meal. I couldn't keep anything down.'\n\nReferred back to UCLH by her GP, doctors confirmed that Mrs Evans-Lippett's EDS was now impacting on her stomach.\n\n'They told me it wasn't working properly and that I couldn't digest the food I was eating, so instead it was being pushed up.'\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett was kept in hospital on a feeding tube for seven weeks before the decision was made to fit her with a permanent feeding tube in February 2017.\n\nShe said: 'That's where I'm at now and that's where I've been at for the past few years.\n\n'Each day I attach a tube directly to myself, feeding me 50ml of liquid food every hour, for 10 hours a day, providing me with a total of 1,000 calories - the amount people normally have on a strict weight loss regime.'\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett, who is 5ft 5, has a body mass index (BMI) of just 15.6, as opposed to the NHS recommended range of between 18.5 to 25.\n\nWorried that losing more weight would impact further on her failing health, Mrs Evans-Lippett is now keen to start a treatment available at Hampshire's Southampton General Hospital.\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett, pictured with her husband, said: 'I'd always had \"clicky hips\" growing up, but I'd never thought anything of it'\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett had to stop singing despite having sell-out gigs before her health snowballed\n\nCalled total parenteral nutrition (TPN), it enables the body's daily requirement of nutrients to be fed through a catheter placed in a vein leading to the heart.\n\n'I'm waiting for the referral from my consultant until I can start the treatment,' she said.\n\n'In the meantime, I'm hoping to raise funds to see the private specialist at UCLH so we can look into alternatives.\n\n'There's got to be more to life than this. I just hope sharing my story gets me one step closer to a better life and will help raise awareness of this awful disease.'\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett had to stop singing despite having sell-out gigs before her health snowballed.\n\nSadly, Mrs Evans-Lippett had only properly found her voice when her health disasters began, when a fellow church goer insisted she take up jazz singing.\n\n'But the worst thing about my EDS was hearing that in some cases it's genetic, which means Amelia could get it,' she said.\n\n'That's what keeps me up at night. That's what makes me shout and scream.\n\n'I've been told I should be seeing an EDS specialist every six months but with costs adding up to \u00a3600 per appointment with trains and accommodation, having no income makes it next to impossible.'\n\nMrs Evans-Lippett is trying to raise \u00a34,000 using GoFundMe in the hope of it giving her 'some form of life back'.\n\nTo donate to Chloe's fundraiser, visit here.", "description": "Chloe Evans-Lippett, 31, of Dorset, said her hip would dislocate up to 20 times a day.
