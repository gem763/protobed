When contacted by ABC News, the Daily Mirror declined to comment on the proceedings.\n\n(MORE: Prince Harry retraces his mom Princess Diana's footsteps at Angola landmine field)\n\nThe new claims filed by Harry are reminiscent of the telephone hacking scandal that engulfed several British tabloids a decade ago, according to ABC News' royal contributor Omid Scobie. News of the World was shuttered in 2011 as a result of the hacking scandal that extended to the British government and saw a reporter from the outlet accused of hacking the voicemail of aides to the royal family.\n\nPrince Harry, now 35, was in his 20s and years away from meeting his future wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, when the hacking scandal unfolded.\n\nNow a husband and a dad who earlier this week announced legal action against another British tabloid, the Mail on Sunday, Harry is using his platform to take on the British press.\n\n\"For Harry this comes after three years of what he says is a relentless campaign by some of the British tabloids to damage the reputation of his wife through insulting commentary pieces, negative stories and false gossip,\" said Scobie. \"This is a man who feels emboldened to take on three of the most-read newspapers in the country and fight for what he believes is right.\"\n\n\"Harry and Meghan really want to draw a line to say, 'Enough is enough.' They will not tolerate the abuse anymore,\" he added.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday, the subject of the lawsuit announced on Tuesday, published a letter in February that Meghan is said to have written to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, after he missed her May 2018 wedding to Harry.\n\nEvents surrounding the couple's wedding are said to have led to Meghan's estrangement from her father, who bowed out of walking Meghan down the aisle at St. George's Chapel amid a paparazzi scandal and a reported heart attack.\n\nHarry and Meghan sought legal advice immediately after Meghan's letter was published in the Mail on Sunday, according to Scobie.\n\n\"This industry of 'fast' news is incredibly toxic and I think Harry wants to change this, not just for himself and his wife, but for the entire royal family in general and the future members of the royal family like the Cambridge children and Archie,\" he said. \"This is Harry feeling confident enough to take on what he sees as dark force.\"\n\nA Mail on Sunday spokesman said in a statement in response to the Sussexes' legal claim, \"The Mail on Sunday stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously. Specifically, we categorically deny that the duchess's letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.\"\n\nHarry, whose mother, Princess Diana, died in a car crash in 1997 while being chased by paparazzi, delivered a passionate statement announcing the claim against the tabloid, describing Meghan as \"one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences.\"\n\n\"Though this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one. Because my deepest fear is history repeating itself,\" Harry said. \"I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\"\n\n(MORE: Prince Harry invokes Princess Diana's death in new legal action against British tabloid)", "description": "Prince Harry takes new legal action against the press over 'illegal interception of voicemail messages' originally appeared on goodmorningamerica.comPrince Harry's battle against media outlets in the U.K. appears to be growing.Buckingham Palace confirmed Friday that Harry, the Duke of Sussex", "authors": ["Katie Kindelan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bPli777E.NO74fXoAzSPTg--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.gma.com/markle-harry-3-sh-ml-191004_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
