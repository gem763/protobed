While some research has found a link, a new, robust study on the topic has revealed somewhat surprising results: that the amount of time teens spend on social media appears to have no connection to such mental health issues.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, it\u2019s the longest study ever on social media and mental health,\u201d lead author Sarah Coyne, a professor of family life at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah, tells Yahoo Lifestyle about the research, which followed adolescents over a period of eight years. The findings were published earlier this month in the journal Computers in Human Behavior.\n\n\u201cWe spent eight years trying to really understand the relationship between time spent on social media and depression for developing teenagers,\u201d Coyne said in a BYU press release. \u201cIf they increased their social media time, would it make them more depressed? Also, if they decreased their social media time, were they less depressed? The answer is no. We found that time spent on social media was not what was impacting anxiety or depression.\u201d\n\nExisting research on the topic, Coyne notes in the study\u2019s abstract, is mostly an observation of data, and \u201clacks analytic techniques examining individual change over time.\u201d In this new study, however, the same 500 participants completed annual surveys, about both time spent on social media and the state of their mental health, during the ages of 13 to 20 \u2014 \u201creally important time periods in terms of mental health and development,\u201d Coyne says.\n\n\u201cResults revealed that increased time spent on social media was not associated with increased mental health issues across development when examined at the individual level,\u201d the study notes. \u201cHopefully these results can move the field of research beyond its past focus on screen time.\u201d\n\nCoyne, a mother of five, stresses that the findings should not be taken as a green light for adolescents to enjoy limitless time on Instagram, Snapchat or other popular platforms. \u201cOne of my biggest fears about the study,\u201d she says, is that it somehow gets misinterpreted, paving the way for \u201cunfettered access to social media for, say, my 11-year-old.\u201d\n\nInstead, the researcher is hoping her findings \u201cmove us beyond screen time,\u201d because aiming to \u201cjust get kids off phones is not going to help all that much.\u201d\n\nThe amount of time teens spend on social media has risen 62.5 percent since 2012 and continues to grow, the study points out. In 2018, the average time teenagers spent on social media was estimated at 2.6 hours per day.\n\nWhat Coyne found in her research was that, at age 13, adolescents reported an average social media use of 31 to 60 minutes daily, with duration increasing steadily so that by young adulthood, use had climbed upwards of two hours a day.\n\nBased on these realities, Coyne hopes to educate kids about wise social media use, and \u201cempower parents with real tools they can use to help regulate the habits.\u201d\n\nWhile this new study looked strictly at time spent on social media in relation to mental health struggles, Coyne\u2019s past research has examined other healthy or unhealthy aspects of the ways in which social media is used, prompting her to offer three suggestions on how to use social media more positively:\n\nBe an active, rather than passive, user: Instead of just scrolling, actively comment, post and like the content of other users.\n\nStop using social media at least an hour before bedtime, as \u201cthat hour right before bedtime tends to be really problematic in terms of disrupting sleep,\u201d Coyne notes, and getting enough sleep is \u201cone of the most protective factors for mental health.\u201d\n\nBe intentional in your use of social media and examine your motivations. For example, \u201cIf you\u2019re just using it because you\u2019re bored, that tends to bring more negative outcomes,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you get on specifically to seek out information or to connect with others, that can have a more positive effect than getting on just because you\u2019re bored.\u201d\n\nFinally, Coyne tells Yahoo Lifestyle, \u201cSocial media is not going away anytime soon, [so] the conversations we are having in our society are just not realistic\u2026 a fear based, end-of-the-world type of approach. The average teen is of course on social media, so we need to teach them to be thoughtful and mindful about it.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "\u201cWe spent eight years trying to really understand the relationship between time spent on social media and depression for developing teenagers,\u201d lead researcher Sarah Coyne explains.", "authors": ["Beth Greenfield", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tdaLJMTl6IdXJNPHVAtFbA--~B/aD00MDEzO3c9NjAxOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/d2896310-f734-11e9-bfe9-cfcecbb031cc", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
