(AP) - Jeff Hottle hoped to prepare his family for the day when he would leave them.\n\nHe wanted to share with them his best advice, and he wanted them to always be able to hold a piece of him in their hands because he worried that he may only have months to live.\n\nJeff had good reason to worry. In the summer of 2016, he tripped in Caledonia State Park on a path he had run many times before. It was an odd sensation before he fell, as he felt his foot drag along the ground before his body hit the ground.\n\nIt would take nearly a year to find out why his body was betraying him.\n\nTHE DIAGNOSIS\n\nJeff, now 49, had been telling himself that he wasn\u2019t getting any younger. He was an avid runner, but starting in about 2014, he found himself tiring more easily. By 2016, he felt like he had lead weights around his ankles when he exercised.\n\nJeff and his wife, Kelley, loved to hike, travel and work in their backyard together. Jeff worked long days as director of human services for a large Macy\u2019s fulfillment center, and when he was home in Chambersburg, he was devoted to his wife of more than two decades and three daughters.\n\nJeff had grown up in the outdoors, camping, sailing and hitting the beach with his family and the family of his childhood friend, Tracy Mullins of Shrewsbury.\n\nSo, he was baffled by his stumble at Caledonia and the weakness he felt in his legs and shoulders. He waited until the end of 2016 to see a doctor, and it remained a mystery.\n\nA neurologist he visited thought he had a muscular issue, and a rheumatologist thought he had a neurological problem, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, his physician told Jeff repeatedly that he did not have ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cThe obscurity was just stifling, knowing something\u2019s happening but not knowing what,\u201d Jeff said.\n\nFinally, he got an appointment at Johns Hopkins with a specialist. There, tests upon tests began to reveal to a team of doctors what Jeff had. When he, Kelly and one of their daughters waited in a room for the doctor, a nurse performed a breathing test on Jeff. Her nametag was turned around so they couldn\u2019t read the three letters that would reveal his diagnosis: ALS.\n\nKelley had already believed this was his condition and had been crying about it for weeks. Jeff wanted to hear it from the doctor, but when he did, a hurricane of emotions hit him.\n\n\u201cIt was so loud in my head that I couldn\u2019t hear. Dr. (Charlotte) Sumner kept talking, but I couldn\u2019t hear. It was almost like I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Jeff said.\n\nIn an instant, his future blew up.\n\n\u201cNothing would be the same,\u201d he said. \u201cHow would we move forward? Goals, dreams, wishes, routines suddenly stopped.\u201d\n\nHe was 47 years old.\n\n\u2018GO MOVE A MOUNTAIN\u2019\n\nJeff looked at his life as though he may only have six months left. Quit working, he told himself, and start writing the book in his head.\n\nHe retired less than three months after his diagnosis and self-published a book, \u201cAnd they wonder why we drink: Life through the eyes of a man who is so normal that he is the oddball.\u201d\n\nHe wrote what he knew: At work, he worked on sexual harassment cases and employees\u2019 drug and alcohol issues. \u201cThere\u2019s amazing depths to which the human experience can sink \u2026 and amazing heights to which the human experience can rise.\u201d\n\nIn the fast pace of business life, \u201cwe can lose the human element of what we\u2019re doing but the human element makes it all possible.\u201d\n\nEach chapter ends with life lessons for his daughters. His final advice: Go move a mountain.\n\n\u201cI wanted them to have something tangible of me, and not just a family heirloom but a tangible piece of my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall message was: Life is not about you. It\u2019s about what you make it and how you improve the lives of others.\u201d\n\nFOUR LITTLE BEARS\n\nTracy Mullins commutes to Baltimore for work every day, but the work she really loves is in the sewing room of her home.\n\nShe makes teddy bears, and the first four of those bears were for her old friend, Jeff Hottle.\n\nJeff and Kelley had found bears online, made from pieces of clothing, often given as keepsakes for the loved ones of someone who died. Jeff wanted his daughters and wife to have homemade bears, stitched together from his old work shirts.\n\nKelley thought of Tracy, who created blankets and pillows as keepsakes. Could Tracy make bears? It would make them all that more special.\n\nWell, Tracy once made miniature bears, she told them, but not in a long time. She would need to create a pattern first. She made the four bears and started making more, now sellilng them on Etsy.\n\nShe has made bears for three breast cancer patients, friends of another breast cancer survivor. She\u2019s in the midst of 25 bears, made for a man\u2019s grandchildren. She even makes bears from a child\u2019s onesies.\n\nA woman who saw her bears once told her she wouldn\u2019t buy flowers for a funeral anymore. \u201cFlowers die,\u201d Mullins remembered her saying. \u201cThese can be kept forever.\u201d\n\nSIX MONTHS\n\nAt Christmas, Jeff gave his wife and three daughters the bears Tracy had made from his work shirts.\n\nHe wanted to see them receive the gifts while he is alive.\n\n\u201cThey were cuter than I thought they\u2019d be,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were shirts that I had worn for quite some time, and they had been transformed into keepsakes.\u201d\n\nAt one time, he thought he had just six months to live, and he wrote his book and quit his job, watching the clock tick on his life. But now, he focuses on today and all that he has, including two grandchildren.\n\nHe said: \u201cWith the right perspective, there\u2019s a lot of beauty in life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rough, but we laugh every day,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cHe\u2019s so calm. He always says, \u2018We\u2019ll figure it out.\u2019 With ALS, there\u2019s a fighting chance.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2mnEHgO\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jeff Hottle hoped to prepare his family for the day when he would leave them.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kim Strong"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
