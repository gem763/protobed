She blended in so well that the venue\u2019s security guards appeared unable to identify her and it fell to Hadid to face up to the trespasser and shoo her off the runway.\n\nOn Benoliel\u2019s YouTube channel, where she goes by the name Marie s\u2019Infiltre, her biography reads: \u201cMarie infiltrates everywhere, to better reveal the comic reality that is hidden in the news!\u201d Earlier in the week she infiltrated an Etam presentation where she again passed undetected for some time as part of the show by wearing silver underwear. After the Chanel invasion she posted a picture of herself with Hadid online.\n\nA Chanel spokeswoman said that the infiltrator had taken them by complete surprise but that \u201cthis is not the first time that she has done this\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to make a drama out of it,\u201d she added. \u201cWe would have preferred if it hadn\u2019t happened.\u201d The woman was \u201cescorted to the exit by our security personnel afterwards\u201d.\n\nThe incident did not derail the show, which was the first ready-to-wear collection produced entirely by Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s successor, Virginie Viard. Viard was Lagerfeld\u2019s longstanding \u201cright hand\u201d, first at Chlo\u00e9 and then at Chanel, and took over at the brand after his death in February.\n\nThe set, assembled within the soaring art nouveau arches of the Grand Palais in Paris, was a 330-metre recreation of the city\u2019s distinctive peach-coloured Lutetian limestone and zinc rooftops. Chanel\u2019s sets are always spectacular \u2013 Lagerfeld\u2019s famously consisted of aeroplanes and entire supermarkets \u2013 but this was evocative in a more understated way. It came with realistic signs of life: the creamy stone was infused with a smoky grey patina while the \u201czinc\u201d (actually painted linoleum) was tarnished.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tweed and boucle on the runway.

Hemlines were short, with A-line and puffball skirts cut to the mid-thigh, a departure from the longstanding midi hemline trend still seen at many of the other fashion houses.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chanel\u2019s iconic quilted bag \u2013 with a new-season twist Photograph: Corbis via Getty\n\nThere was a kaleidoscope of tweed and boucle, from the opening look \u2013 a black suit jacket with short black kilt \u2013 to sturdy pink and red romper suits. The shoes were commercial and wearable, comprising patent flat and block-heeled sandals and the ever-popular cream and black Chanel two tones. Another standout section featured graphic, block-printed silk skirts, suits and jackets with \u201cChanel\u201d in white block capitals.\n\nViard has already shown resort and couture collections for Chanel, thoughready-to-wear tends to have the most impact. So far her output has been interpreted as quieter than the pop-art stylings of her predecessor. Some have seen Coco Chanel as the dominant influence in Viard\u2019s pared-back take on house codes.\n\nLike many of the shows this season, Viard presented a simplified way of dressing, a heartening riposte to the frequent fashion brand impulse to pile on the merchandise on the catwalk. That aesthetic \u2013 with models often wearing many-layered outfits and carrying more than one handbag on the catwalk \u2013 can feel queasily like stuffification for shoppers increasingly tuned in to concerns about sustainability.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A model in a fresh take on the classic Chanel suit.

Chanel is \u201ccommitted wherever possible to recovering, recycling and/or reusing materials and elements used in the set design for the shows\u201d, a spokesperson said.\n\nFounded by Coco Chanel as a small millinery boutique in 1910, Chanel is now a world megabrand. In 2018 its revenues rose 13% to $11.1bn (\u00a39.1bn).", "description": "Gigi Hadid stepped in to stop a prankster derailing Virginie Viard\u2019s elegantly understated show", "authors": ["Hannah Marriott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc1c1f4c89e53677310dc3dbcd28b05abfd0e80d/0_3_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dcfe9f33fd3dd4fcd0bdc9afaecf4013", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
