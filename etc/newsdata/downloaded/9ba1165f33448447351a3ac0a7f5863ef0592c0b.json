Add Interest\n\nThe bombshell texts were expected to fuel the ongoing impeachment inquiry by House Democrats, and put increasing pressure on Republicans to defend the administration\u2019s actions.\n\nIn text messages provided to the House Intelligence Committee, Kurt Volker \u2013 at the time the special envoy to Ukraine \u2013 tells a top aide to Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Zelenskiy would have to persuade Trump in a phone call later that day \u2013 July 25 -- that he\u2019s willing to initiate an investigation.\n\nJose Luis Magana/AP\n\nVolker was pressing Ukraine to announce it would examine potential 2016 election meddling, an apparent reference to conservatives\u2019 claims that Ukrainian politicians had tried to help Hillary Clinton beat Trump. Volker also wanted Ukraine to say it would look into the dealings of Burisma, an energy company that employed Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, on its board.\n\nIn one July exchange, he writes to the Ukrainian government aide that Zelenskiy will be granted a meeting in Washington \u2013 if he meets U.S. conditions.\n\n\u201cHeard from White House \u2014 Assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.\u201d\n\nThe aide later responded that the phone call between the two leaders went well. More than a week later, on Aug. 10, the aide says the Ukrainian president is willing to make the statement on the investigation the U.S. wants, but requests a date for the meeting first.\n\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBy September, after it became clear that hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid to Ukraine may have been on the line too, a third career foreign service officer weighed in declaring such a quid pro quo would be \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nThe head of the Federal Election Commission on Friday retweeted her past statement that any quid pro quo intended to benefit a political campaign violates election laws.\n\n\u201cIt is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIs this thing on? \ud83c\udf99 https://t.co/K6phZRex8k \u2014 Ellen L Weintraub (@EllenLWeintraub) October 3, 2019\n\nThree House Democrats chairing key oversight committees said in a statement that the texts show a pattern of abuse of power and that they were particularly alarmed by Trump publicly calling for China to also investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cIt is unethical, unpatriotic, and wrong,\u201d the Democrats wrote. \u201cAmerican Presidents should never press foreign powers to target their domestic political rivals.\u201d\n\nRepublicans mostly defended the president or remained silent on the matter, although Texas Republican Rep. Will Hurd, who announced this summer he is retiring his House seat, said he was disturbed by the texts.\n\n\u201cI think some of these things are indeed damning,\u201d he told CNN on Friday. \u201cHowever I want to make sure we get through this entire investigation before coming to some kind of conclusions.\u201d\n\nTrump, who on Thursday openly said not only Ukraine but China should investigate the Bidens, insisted in tweets Friday that he did nothing wrong asking \u2013 that it was about ending corruption not politics.\n\n\u201cAs President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!\u201d\n\nABC News' Conor Finnegan and Katherine Faulders contributed to this report.", "description": "Newly released texts show U.S. diplomats offered Ukraine a meeting with President Trump is they promised to launch a political investigation involving Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-afo-gty-ps-191004_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
