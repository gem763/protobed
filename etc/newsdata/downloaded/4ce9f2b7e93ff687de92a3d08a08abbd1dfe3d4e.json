American negotiators have proposed including the language in other prospective deals, including with the European Union, Britain and members of the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe administration\u2019s push is the latest salvo in a global fight over who sets the rules for the internet. While the rules for trading goods have largely been written \u2014 often by the United States \u2014 the world has far fewer standards for digital products. Countries are rushing into this vacuum, and in most cases writing regulations that are far more restrictive than the tech industry would prefer.\n\nEurope has enacted tough policies to curb the behavior of companies like Facebook and Google and passed laws to deal with privacy, hate speech and disinformation. China has largely cordoned itself off from the rest of the internet, allowing Beijing to censor political content and bolster Chinese tech companies like Alibaba and Tencent. In India, Indonesia, Russia and Vietnam, governments are introducing regulations to ostensibly protect their citizens\u2019 privacy and build domestic internet industries that critics say will stymie the ability of American companies to provide services in those countries.", "description": "The push is the latest salvo in a global fight over who gets to set the rules for the internet.", "authors": ["David Mccabe", "Ana Swanson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/business/00DIGITALTRADE-01/00DIGITALTRADE-01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
