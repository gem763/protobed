Every year I assess my races \u2013 where I can improve or get a bit stronger or quicker to keep pushing where I can go as an athlete. I think that\u2019s how you keep being great irrespective of your results.\u201d\n\nAsher-Smith said she had not responded to the hundreds of tweets and messages she had received since winning the 200m in a British record time because she did not want to jeopardise the British 4x100m women\u2019s chances of winning a medal this weekend. But she did admit to enjoying a congratulations video sent by the Great British Bake Off star Mary Berry, which the athlete described as \u201cso cool\u201d.\n\nShe also paid tribute to her coach, John Blackie, who has guided her career since she was eight. \u201cHe is like a second dad to me,\u201d Asher-Smith said.\n\n\u201cHis intelligence and patience is what gets us through. He knows me so well and understands my moods. He has known me since I was eight and he\u2019s had such a part to play in who I am as a woman today.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Seb Coe has predicted that Asher-Smith will become the \u201cposter child\u201d for the British team at next year\u2019s Olympics providing she keeps her focus. Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, said: \u201cIt\u2019s only a short time in your career where you know you will probably win \u2013 and the rest of the field know that \u2013 and she looks like she has entered that period.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\n\u201cCareers can sometimes be brutally short but if she can combine a world championship win with an Olympic title it puts her in the top handful of performers.\n\n\u201cThere are athletes who love the championships environment. They are trout going up stream. She looks like she is really enjoying it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what advice he would give her, Coe was clear. \u201cDon\u2019t screw around with too many variables, do what you are doing, don\u2019t introduce new things. If it is working let it be. Keep the continuity. She is going into the next season as the poster child of our Games next year. I cannot think of anybody else who will so easily fit that bill.\u201d\n\nHowever, Coe said Asher-Smith had to be careful not to get distracted by the celebrity circuit. \u201cShe will have to be buried away in training and get that balance,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has a heightened awareness of what she can do in the sport. We have chatted about that on various occasions.\n\n\u201cI hope for her own self she is a little bit selfish and doesn\u2019t feel a responsibility to go to everything. She will figure it out, she is smart.\u201d", "description": "Dina Asher-Smith has set her sights on becoming one of the greatest athletes of all time after her 200m world championship gold medal in Doha", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89b5230581434c282cc13977229830b51fe76f75/0_123_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a82d7089514ff12c60cd2da77bfc5f22"}
