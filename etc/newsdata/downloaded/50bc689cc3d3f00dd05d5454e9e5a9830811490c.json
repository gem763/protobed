So when it went on sale, I decided to take the plunge. This oil is definitely expensive, but I have no regrets about buying it because, as you can see, I used it to the very last drop. What I like most about this oil is how intensely nourishing and hydrating it is on the skin without being at all heavy. It\u2019s the lightest face oil I\u2019ve ever tried, so if you\u2019re the kind of person who likes the results face oils deliver but can\u2019t stand that thick, greasy feeling, this one is great. It\u2019s incredibly healing: Anytime I was struggling with post-breakout scabs, redness, or dry patches, I put this on and it sped up the healing process. (A note: The best dupe for this oil is Go-To\u2019s Face Hero, which delivers nearly identical results at a fraction of the price.)", "description": "The Beauty Products Our Writer Used The Most 2019  including Dr. Loretta Gentle Hydrating Cleanser, SMD Cosmetics Saromae Snail Secretion Cream, PURITO Centella Green Level Unscented Sun SPF50+ PA++++ and Supernal Cosmic Glow Oil.", "authors": ["Rio Viera-Newton"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/10/16/16-beauty-0.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
