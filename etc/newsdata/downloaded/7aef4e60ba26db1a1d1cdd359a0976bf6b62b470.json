Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) told reporters Tuesday.\n\nThe meeting, which Kent told lawmakers took place on May 23, according to Connolly, was just days after the administration recalled Marie Yovanovitch from her post as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Yovanovitch spoke to House investigators last week about the campaign against her, which she and other former diplomats have said was organized by Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe revelations from Kent\u2019s testimony suggest the decision to wrest Ukraine policy away from career diplomats and put it in the hands of officials seen as more sympathetic to the president was taken several weeks before Trump spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In their July 25 call, Trump appeared to pressure the Ukrainian leader into launching probes of the 2016 U.S. election and the son of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nAdministration officials informed the Ukrainians of their decision to shift authority for Ukraine policy during a meeting with Zelensky in Kiev on June 2, Connolly recalled Kent as saying.\n\n\u201cFor some Americans from the embassy, that was news to them,\u201d he added.\n\nAD\n\nKent spoke for several hours Tuesday in a closed-door meeting with the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees, which together are conducting an impeachment probe into whether Trump abused his office to pressure a foreign government into doing work that could affect the election.\n\nAD\n\nThe longtime Foreign Service official had been summoned for a deposition in the investigation, with Democrats expected to question him about a campaign by Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, to pressure Ukraine into investigating the president\u2019s political rival.\n\nKent arrived on Capitol Hill after the House Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena for his testimony, according to a congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. The White House, in a letter to top Democrats last week, said it would not cooperate with the impeachment investigation, forcing Democrats to rely on subpoenas to compel witnesses to appear.\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani accused Yovanovitch and Kent, formerly the No. 2 ranking diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, of trying to protect the Bidens from an investigation by Ukrainian prosecutors. Yovanovitch, who was recalled from Kiev in May, adamantly pushed back on those accusations during testimony before House investigators on Friday. Kent will also likely be asked about those assertions.\n\nAD\n\nInternal documents turned over to Congress by the State Department inspector general in early October preview what Kent might tell lawmakers: The messages show that Kent suspected beginning in March that Yovanovitch had become the target of a \u201cclassic disinformation operation\u201d \u2014 and that he raised concerns to his superiors in hopes they would defend their own.\n\nGiuliani and a columnist for the news outlet the Hill had alleged earlier this year that Yovanovitch provided a \u201cdo not prosecute list\u201d to Ukrainian officials to protect the Bidens and other allies. But Kent, according to the documents, told his colleagues that the list was phony, pointing to incorrect name spellings that longtime officials like Yovanovitch and himself would never have gotten wrong, he said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOne key sign of it being fake is that most of the names are misspelled in English \u2014 we would never spell most that way,\u201d said Kent, who is fluent in Russian and Ukrainian, in one email to colleagues.\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani has maintained that his activities related to Ukraine were above board and that he\u2019s done nothing wrong.\n\nKent, according to the documents, suggested that the department could counter the attack by \u201ccircling in red all the misspellings and grammar mistakes and reposting it,\u201d as the U.S. Embassy in Moscow had done in similar counter-propaganda campaigns.\n\n\u201cIf we wanted to push back hard(er), we could consider a similar approach,\u201d he said.\n\nLawmakers are bound to ask Kent about whom he contacted with his concerns. According to the inspector general\u2019s documents, he took them to Philip Reeker, a U.S. diplomat in Europe, and later forwarded them to the No. 3 official at the department, David Hale, and State Department counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a close confidant of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBrechbuhl also has been summoned for testimony before House Democrats.\n\nIn an attempt to make sense of what he called the \u201cfake list,\u201d Kent suggested it could be an effort by a former Ukrainian prosecutor \u2014 Yuri Lutsenko, who was ousted for corruption \u2014 to try to pin the blame for his failures on the United States.\n\n\u201cThis list appears to be an effort by Lutsenko to inoculate himself for why he did not pursue corrupt associates and political allies \u2014 to claim that the U.S. told him not to,\u201d Kent said. \u201cComplete poppycock.\u201d\n\nLawmakers will most assuredly question Kent about that theory as well, given his vast knowledge of the region.\n\nKent, who joined the State Department in 1992, currently serves as deputy assistant secretary in the European and Eurasian Bureau, where he oversees policy on Ukraine as well as about half a dozen additional countries. From 2015 to 2018, he served as deputy chief of mission in Kiev. Previously he was senior anti-corruption coordinator in the State Department\u2019s European Bureau.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKent is one of more than a half-dozen State officials who have been summoned by Democrats as part of their probe into Trump\u2019s bid to pressure Ukraine into digging up dirt on the Biden family \u2014 and sideline State officials who did not take well to that task. Democrats have also requested documents from the White House, Vice President Pence, the Pentagon, and the Office of Management and Budget, subpoena deadlines that will come due this week.\n\nJohn Hudson contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine, is the latest Trump administration official deposed as part of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Paul Kane", "Senior Congressional Correspondent", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_Nc6YDCWcCnLzKeHbWtLkPmj_EY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DMUAPUXPKMI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
