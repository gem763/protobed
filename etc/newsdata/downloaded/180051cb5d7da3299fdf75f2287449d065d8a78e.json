She came back on Thursday to hold a Q&A session for the two hundred-plus policies on her agenda.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Hong Kong protest leader Jimmy Sham of the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) was attacked by a group of \u201cat least four non-ethnic Chinese assailants\u201d in the Mong Kok district and beaten to the ground with hammers and wrenches. Bystanders said the attackers brandished knives at them when they attempted to halt the beating.\n\nSham was reportedly struck in the head and arms by his assailants and was found lying in a pool of blood, but he was said to be in stable condition at the hospital with no sign of brain injury as of Thursday morning.\n\nAccording to his CHRF colleague Figo Chan, as Sham was departing in an ambulance his last words were, \u201cFive demands, not one less\u201d \u2013 a favored slogan of the protest movement. Sham was attacked and beaten with clubs on a previous occasion during the Hong Kong uprising, but never before this severely. Adding insult to injury, pro-democracy legislator Tanya Chan noted that the assailants from Sham\u2019s previous beating were never arrested.\n\nWhen Carrie Lam arrived at LegCo for her Q&A session on Thursday, she was greeted with chants of \u201cFive demands, not one less\u201d from legislators and placards that depicted her with bloody hands.\n\nIn addition to police brutality and gang violence like the attack on Jimmy Sham, pro-democracy legislators carried funeral flowers to symbolize the death of a 15-year-old student named Chan Yin-lam, a teenage activist whose body was found floating naked in the sea three days after she disappeared on September 19.\n\nChan\u2019s death was officially ruled a suicide, but many suspect she was murdered, or at least believe the police have not properly investigated her disappearance and demise. Student activists believe the last known campus CCTV footage of Chan was deceptively edited before it was released to the public, while officials say the edits were performed only to protect the identity of unrelated persons captured in the footage and police have seen the unedited video.\n\nWhen pro-democracy lawmakers asked LegCo President Andrew Leung to permit a moment of silence in honor of Chan Yin-lam, he refused and ejected three of the legislators from the chamber, including Claudia Mo, who is currently pressing a complaint against firebrand pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho for using \u201cblatantly sexist and racist\u201d language against her.\n\nAnother legislator, Ted Hui, was ejected for yelling \u201cHow are you still qualified to be the chief executive?\u201d at Lam. He was soon joined by Kwok Ka-ki, who was ejected for asking Lam to apologize for causing the protest movement.\n\nThings snowballed from there, with more aggressive questions, shouts of protest, and placards directed at Lam, countered with objections and accusations from pro-Beijing legislators, until the session was suspended, resumed, and finally canceled after more ejections.\n\nThe 12 lawmakers ejected from the chamber complained that security guards handled them roughly, as reported by the Hong Kong Free Press:\n\nAfter the session with Chief Executive Carrie Lam was cut short on Thursday, legislator Au Nok-hin attempted to chase after her. Au said a female security guard then tried to wrestle him to the ground. As a result, his left arm was injured and left bleeding. \u201cThis is unacceptable \u2013 I am stripped of my right to protest,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no need for the security guard to do this.\u201d He said he would consider reporting the case to the police. Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting also said he was shoved by security guards in an attempt to prevent him from protesting. \u201cI was conducting a peaceful protest. I only had a placard. LegCo security guards were acting like the government\u2019s personal security, and Carrie Lam has more than ten guards to herself,\u201d he said. Lawmaker Claudia Mo said that four to five male guards used their arms to push away Civic Party lawmaker Tanya Chan. \u201cEven if [Chan] was not protesting, it would still be unacceptable for four to five men to surround a woman,\u201d Mo said. \u201cIt would be very dangerous if she fell.\u201d Chan said disproportionate force was used with the intention to injure lawmakers.\n\nFor their part, pro-Beijing lawmakers complained it was the \u201cworst Q&A session ever conducted\u201d because the pro-democracy legislators were so disruptive. They said serious discussion of Lam\u2019s policy proposals was important for the economic health of Hong Kong and should not have been thwarted by political theater.", "description": "Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam was heckled by anti-communist legislators for the second day in a row on Thursday.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/legislature-hong-kong-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
