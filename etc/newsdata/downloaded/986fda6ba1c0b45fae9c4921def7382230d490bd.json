REUTERS/Jason Lee/Illustration\n\nProspects for progress in U.S.-China trade talks dimmed on Monday after Washington blacklisted Chinese companies but comments by U.S. President Donald Trump and his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow on looming trade talks were generally upbeat.\n\n\u201cWe think there\u2019s a chance we could do something very substantial,\u201d Trump said about the talks.\n\nThis comes after a media report stated that China is looking to narrow the scope of the talks.\n\n\u201cChina is realistic and would only target issues that both countries have agreed on this week,\u201d a DBS note said. However, sentiment seemed buoyed on hopes of a partial deal despite Washington\u2019s move to blacklist Chinese companies.\n\nThe Chinese yuan CNY=CFXS reopened after a week long holiday to strengthen 0.3%.\n\n\u201cHopes have emerged on trade talks, inspired by reports that Beijing is preparing to work through tough negotiations with the U.S., setting a time-line for the thorny issues,\u201d Vishnu Varathan, senior economist at Mizuho Bank said in a note.\n\nThe Philippine peso PHP= firmed 0.3% against the dollar, clawing back some of the losses from the previous session. The peso had weakened 0.4% on Monday amid caution ahead of the trade talks.\n\nThe Taiwan dollar TWD=TP strengthened 0.3%. Data showed that the island's equity markets received about $2.9 billion of foreign investment in September, on optimism over its economy, as a growing number of local firms were shifting their factories to Taiwan from mainland China.\n\nThe South Korean won KRW=KFTC firmed 0.2% after better than expected third quarter forecast from the world's biggest semiconductor firm, Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), reduced concerns over South Korea's exports.\n\nMeanwhile, the Thai Baht THB=TH bucked the trend to weaken about 0.1%. The baht has shown resilience by strengthening by the most among Asian units so far this year.\n\nIndian financial markets were closed for a holiday.", "description": "Most Asian currencies edged higher on Tuesday with the Chinese yuan firming the most after reopening from a week long holiday while investors held positions ahead of the high level Sino-U.S. trade talks on Thursday and Friday.", "authors": ["Shreya Mariam Job", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438359497&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970F5", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
