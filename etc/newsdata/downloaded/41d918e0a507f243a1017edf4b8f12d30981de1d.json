But the 21-year-old\u2019s busy schedule has already taken a toll on his health that led to an intervention from his parents, Will and Jada.\n\n\u201cWill and I had a bit of an intervention with Jaden because he\u2019s a vegan now, but we realized he wasn\u2019t getting enough protein,\u201d Jada said on the Season Two premiere of her Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk. \u201cSo he was wasting away. He just looked drain, he was just depleted. He wasn\u2019t getting the nutrients.\u201d\n\nThe episode, which featured regulars Jada, Willow Smith and Adrienne Banfield-Norris, also brought Will, Jaden and Trey Smith to the red table for a discussion about health and food. And after Will had an admission about his own health, reaching his heaviest weight this past summer, the family discussed Jaden\u2019s scare.\n\nJaden Smith admits that he \"was not doing good\" before his Coachella 2019 performance.

And we got really nervous,\u201d Will said about their son.\n\nJaden joined in the conversation to clarify that he tried to be vegan but has now been a vegetarian for the past year. Before that, however, he agreed that he was unhealthy.\n\n\u201cI was just eating like two meals a day. And maybe one,\u201d Jaden said. \u201cMaybe just that one big meal and then I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, you know I didn\u2019t get around to it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe 21-year-old went onto explain that those unhealthy habits ended up manifesting themselves into sickness right before Coachella.\n\n\u201cI was not doing good. I feel like I was at like an 8 of stress,\u201d he explained. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking good, I wasn\u2019t feeling good, I wasn\u2019t sleeping.\u201d\n\nJaden even experienced nausea spells for an entire day on two different occasions \u2014 one of which landed him in a hospital in Australia, which left his entire family in fear.\n\n\u201cThat scared me,\u201d Willow said. \u201cI was about to hop on the plane to Australia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all were,\u201d Trey added.\n\nThe Red Table Talk episode led to numerous other health-related admissions from members of the Smith family, including both Will and Willow saying that they\u2019ve eaten for physical appearance rather than nutritional value.\n\n\u201cWe all have issues with food in this family,\u201d Jada said.\n\nNow, the family is working on a health and food intervention all together with the help of a pair of professionals that were introduced in the episode, and are encouraging their Red Table Talk audience to join them on their journey.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
