Bernard Sanders said Democratic presidential rival Sen. Kamala D. Harris has changed her views on health care, while arguing that a new proposal of his own amounts to a \u201cclarification\u201d in his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d vision.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris has changed her views on the health care plan,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview with VICE News published this week. \u201cI have not changed my view on the health care plan. All that I\u2019ve changed my views [on] is if an employer, if an employer is spending less money on health care than they used to, who benefits from that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur health care plan was not changed by one word. Kamala Harris changed her views on her health care plan in a very significant way,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Sanders of Vermont said Ms. Harris of California was a co-sponsor of Medicare for All, but is now not comfortable with it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s her privilege. I\u2019m not arguing with her. And she does not support what I support,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Harris campaign responded by saying that Ms. Harris put forth a plan that experts and analysts say is the best way to get to universal health coverage and most reflects expanding the \u201cactual Medicare program\u201d to all Americans.\n\nMs. Harris, a co-sponsor of Mr. Sanders\u2018 bill, recently put out her own plan that calls for a longer transition to Medicare-style insurance policies that still envisions a role for the private insurance industry.\n\nMr. Sanders last week released a plan intended to bolster the strength of labor unions that would require companies to pass on money they would save on contributions to health plans under a Medicare for All system to workers through increased wages or other benefits.\n\nThe Vermont independent said his new policy did not amount to a change to his Medicare for All proposal, calling it a \u201cclarification.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was criticized by some of my opponents, but it did not change one word of our plan,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got a bill. It\u2019s a long bill. We didn\u2019t change one word of the bill.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
