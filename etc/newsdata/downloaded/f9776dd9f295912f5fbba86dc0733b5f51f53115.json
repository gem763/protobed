The comedy centered around a group of Allies at a German prison camp during World War II. While being held as prisoners of war, the group conducts secret spy missions on their dim-witted Nazi captors.\n\nCrane, who played American hero Colonel Hogan in the series, was murdered in 1978 at age 49.\n\n\u201cIt was a shock to hear the potential premise of this after \u2018Hogan's\u2019 effort,\u201d Robert Crane wrote exclusively to Fox News. \u201cOne of the co-creators of \u2018Hogan's Heroes,\u2019 Al Ruddy, is involved, but this afterlife idea is so removed from the original it's hard to conjure up any valid opinion. It's also hard to ignore the success and longevity of the original after 168 episodes playing continuously somewhere in the world for 54 years and counting.\n\n'HOGAN'S HEROES' REBOOT IN THE WORKS FEATURING DESCENDANTS OF ORIGINAL CHARACTERS\n\nBOB CRANE'S SON RECALLS 'HOGAN'S HEROES' STAR'S DOUBLE LIFE, GRISLY 1978 MURDER\n\n\u201cLeave it alone is my worthless opinion,\u201d continued the younger Crane. \u201cEnjoy the original with a cast, stories, and milieu that will never be duplicated or bettered. The Emmy-winning \u201cM*A*S*H\u201d tried and failed. My father, were he alive, might ask, \u2018Why Al? Why now?\u2019 \u2026 I'm tired of appearing at autograph conventions. By the way, loved \u2018The Godfather.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn September 2019, Deadline reported Ruddy, 89, is working on a reboot with executive producers Danny McBride, David Gordon Green and Jody Hill. The reimagined version reportedly will be set in the present day and focus on the descendants of the original characters, who are now scattered around the world, gathering together for a global treasure hunt.\n\nRuddy previously worked on projects like \u201cThe Godfather\u201d and \u201cMillion Dollar Baby.\u201d McBride, Gordon and Hill have found success with HBO series \"Eastbound & Down,\" \"Vice Principals\" and \"The Righteous Gemstones,\" which was just picked up for a second season.\n\nAs Forbes noted, \"Hogan's Heroes\" was politically incorrect, even for its time. The antics of Col. Robert Hogan (played by Bob Crane) and his gang made light of WWII wounds that were still fresh in many Americans' minds. In fact, Robert Clary, who played Corporal Louis LeBeau on the show, was a Holocaust survivor.\n\n'HOGAN'S HEROES' STAR BOB CRANE'S MURDER STILL A MYSTERY DESPITE NEW DNA TESTS\n\n'SAVED BY THE BELL' STAR TIFFANI THIESSEN EXPLAINS WHY SHE\u2019S NOT RETURNING FOR REBOOT\n\nDespite the controversy, \u201cHogan\u2019s Heroes\u201d was a huge hit right out of the gate. It became a Top 10 show in its first season. The show was nominated for 12 Emmy awards during its run, with actor Werner Klemperer, who was Jewish, winning two for his portrayal of Nazi camp leader, Commandant Wilhelm Klink.\n\nAlthough CBS originally aired \u201cHogan\u2019s Heroes,\u201d it\u2019s unclear at this time where its revival would air and whether it would be broadcast or streamed.\n\nRobert Crane previously released a memoir titled \u201cCrane: Sex, Celebrity, and My Father\u2019s Unsolved Murder,\u201d which attempts to shed some light on the man behind the handsome, clean-cut persona.\n\nIn 2018, Crane told Fox News he had both fond and tough memories of his father.\n\n'FAMILY MATTERS' STAR JALEEL WHITE REVEALS HOW HE FEELS ABOUT STEVE URKEL TODAY, ESCAPING CHILD STAR CURSE\n\nLUCILLE BALL ENDURED RUTHLESS CRITICISM ON \u2018LIFE WITH LUCY,\u2019 SAYS CO-STAR: \u2018THEY WERE SO BLOODY\u2019\n\n\u201cI remember when I was a kid during summer vacation, I would go with him down to the station where he would do his radio show [before \u2018Hogan\u2019s],\u201d he said. \u201cNo chauffeurs, no assistants, no handlers. He drove 80 miles an hour to get there by six and be on the air live.\n\n\"Not one cup of coffee. No drugs. Just pure adrenaline and pure love of entertaining people. He craved it\u2026 [But he later] made some bad choices, some bad decisions\u2026 And he missed out on so much over these bad choices he made with people.
