That employee was fired in 2016, at which point the matter was reported to authorities. He faces a maximum of five years in prison.\n\nAD\n\nBoth cases show the challenges the Navy faces as it works with profit-minded manufacturers to build complicated weaponry. They also illustrate how the best-funded defense industry on the planet can still deliver an imperfect product, sometimes degrading the U.S. military\u2019s readiness for war.\n\nIn a letter sent to the company\u2019s shipbuilders recently, Newport News Shipbuilding President Jennifer Boykin admonished employees to conduct their work in an ethical manner, noting that the incidents had called the company\u2019s integrity into question.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe cannot and will not tolerate a lapse in ethics and integrity at Newport News Shipbuilding. Period,\u201d Boykin wrote.\n\nIn his first press statement on the matter, the whistleblower expressed admiration for the company\u2019s shipbuilders, whom he called \u201ctrue craftsmen\u201d who \u201cwant nothing more than to build the finest ships in the world.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLawrence added, however, that he thought the company had made it impossible for him to do his job responsibly.\n\n\u201cI could not in good conscience sit back and watch, be a party to, or provide my signature in the course of accepting work that clearly did not meet contractual requirements and standards,\u201d Lawrence told The Washington Post in an email forwarded by his attorneys. \u201cI could not abide allowing materials I believed to be defective to be installed on submarines bearing our company\u2019s good name.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA spokesman for Huntington Ingalls said the company intends to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d itself, adding that it cooperated fully with an earlier federal investigation. The Justice Department, which declined to comment for this report, decided not to prosecute the case.\n\nNavy spokesman Danny Hernandez declined to comment on the ongoing litigation but emphasized that the hull coating problem \u201cdoes not present a safety concern to the crew or the submarine.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday, a court struck the complaint from the record and asked that a new one be filed by Oct. 15, though the case has not been dismissed. A whistleblower who brings a lawsuit on behalf of the U.S. government under the False Claims Act can be rewarded financially if it is successful.\n\nAD\n\nAn attorney representing Lawrence vowed to move forward with the case.\n\n\u201cAri Lawrence is a young man of great courage,\u201d said Jamie Shoemaker, an attorney representing him. \u201cWe intend to represent his interests and those of the United States aggressively.\"\n\nThe Navy\u2019s Virginia-class \u201cfast attack\u201d submarines are built to quietly patrol unfriendly waters for months at a time, seek out and destroy enemy vessels, or launch cruise missiles against land-based targets. One of them was reportedly used to launch a Tomahawk missile against chemical facilities in Syria last year.\n\nAD\n\nAbout $2.8 billion each, they are among the most expensive assets in the U.S. military arsenal. The Navy\u2019s five-year shipbuilding plan calls for 11 more of them to be built by 2024. The Navy is behind schedule on negotiations for the next 10 submarines and is asking Congress for a substantial increase in funding.\n\nAD\n\nThe ability to operate silently beneath the ocean\u2019s surface has long been a selling point for the Virginia-class program. The exterior hull coating is supposed to absorb the sound waves sent out by enemy sonar detectors, allowing the submarines to operate unnoticed.\n\nBut the Navy has faced a recurring problem in which the coating peels off in large chunks during long deployments as the adhesive that binds it to the hull is buffeted by harsh undersea conditions.\n\n\u201cThe undersea environment is a really tough place for adhesives and coatings,\u201d said Craig Hooper, a defense consultant who has studied the issue, adding that the Navy \u201cshould strive to ensure that best practices are used.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSubmarine experts contacted by The Post said the coating problem would probably not put sailors\u2019 lives at risk under current circumstances, since they are not fighting an active war against a foreign navy.\n\nBut there is a concern that the hull coating problem could render the submarines unfit for missions in which stealth is important, possibly degrading the Navy\u2019s readiness for war. The Defense Department under President Trump has de-emphasized fighting terrorism in favor of competing with Russia and China for military dominance, something that has raised the profile of Navy assets such as the Virginia-class submarine.\n\nIn his whistleblower complaint, Lawrence and his attorneys argued that the crumbling hull coating has endangered the lives of U.S. sailors.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe failure of this exterior sound-absorbing material jeopardizes the safety of the submarines, and makes the submarine easier to detect by those who would seek to harm the United States, thereby endangering the crew and national security,\u201d the complaint alleged.\n\nAD\n\nLawrence\u2019s complaint paints a picture of a manufacturer that ignored Navy requirements in order to keep more of the taxpayer-funded work for itself, and then misled the government to cover up its own shoddy work.\n\nThe complaint accuses \u201ccertain groups within the Huntington Ingalls organization\u201d of seeking to install an important part relevant to the hull coating themselves rather than contract the work out to another company through a competitive process.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the complaint, Lawrence discovered that the departments responsible for applying the coating did not hold the technical certifications required to do so.\n\nLawrence further alleged that the company ignored objections raised by the shipyard\u2019s quality assurance department and \u201cexerted pressure on employees to improperly certify and accept the work performed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAccording to an attorney representing Lawrence, he was fired in October 2017 shortly after he raised concerns. He later brought the issue to the Justice Department, which investigated his claims. A Huntington Ingalls spokesman did not answer specific questions about whether the company had fired Lawrence or pressured employees to falsify records.\n\nBoykin\u2019s letter to shipbuilders Friday urged the company\u2019s shipbuilders to take responsibility for their actions.\n\n\u201cI am a firm believer that we learn more from our failures than our successes, and mistakes are a natural part of life,\u201d Boykin wrote. \u201cTaking ownership of them is how we learn, grow and change. There is a big difference, however, between unintentionally making a mistake and deliberately choosing to do something that is wrong.\u201d", "description": "Contractors allegedly weren't qualified to install an important hull coating on the Navy's Virginia-class fast-attack submarines, leading it to be incorrectly installed.", "authors": ["Aaron Gregg", "Reporter Covering The Defense Industry", "Commercial Aviation", "Government Contractors."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3d5omghQQYR9lMn6bXsu3QFw784=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2NAW5VBJCNEWPNB7FSWY4VUC4M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
