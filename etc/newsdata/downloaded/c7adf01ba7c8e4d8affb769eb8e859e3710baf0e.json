But that\u2019s where we are, in a total what the eff moment, as the detectives realize that they have two nearly identical suspects who just so happen to be brothers. If Unbelievable had sprung out of someone\u2019s imagination fully formed I\u2019d be prone to dismiss this as an absurd attempt at a last-minute plot twist. But this happened. As the (astounding) Marshall Project story that Unbelievable is based on explains, when detectives went to the door of the suspect\u2019s home to install a surveillance camera, another man came to the door. The brothers Marc and Michael O\u2019Leary closely resembled one another, and detectives now had no idea which brother might have committed the rapes, or if they were possibly in on the attacks together.\n\nDuvall and Rasmussen find themselves in that exact quandary. The brothers, called Chris and Curtis McCarthy in the show, have the same physical ID, the same address, and even more confusingly, they share markers on their DNA that will make it impossible for the limited sample the detectives have to rule out either one. That mug with Curtis\u2019s saliva all over it can\u2019t help police determine which brother was at these crime scenes.\n\nLuckily, the detectives\u2019 good old-fashioned police work comes in handy again. They comb the intel they have and begin to tail both brothers. (Admittedly, after years of devout The Americans viewing, I was a little alarmed at how casually detectives sat right outside the McCarthy home and acted as if they wouldn\u2019t be seen.) Both brothers served in the Marines \u2014 Curtis in Okinawa, Christopher in South Korea \u2014 so they each might have the language skills that the rapist explained to Amber so eagerly. But the LPR (license plate reader) that we heard so much about earlier in the season turns up some important results. It spotted Curtis on trips out of town with his girlfriend, meaning he has an alibi for the nights Doris, Lilly, and Sarah were raped. (The girlfriend even posted their whereabouts on Facebook, and you know that shit will hold up in a court of law.) His record is also spotless.\n\nChristopher, however, has left behind a trail of bread crumbs so vast and crunchy that you could roll some chicken in them and have a delicious parm. The day after Sarah\u2019s rape he visited the DMV, a place that would \u201ckill his buzz\u201d Duvall says, as if that wouldn\u2019t apply to all of us. But what the hell did he need a new license for? A Ruger 357, a small revolver just like the one that Amber describes having pointed at her head.\n\nJust as the pieces are falling into place you\u2019d expect Duvall and Rasmussen to be cheering. But both women have years of experience with cases imploding in front of them. One thing Unbelievable does so well is fill in all the gaps that usually exist in police procedurals. They normally skip the moments of daily grind, meticulous affairs like listing every single item that you want to make sure is in the affidavit. They skip from tension point to tension point to keep the viewer breathless. Unbelievable dips and turns, hits points of monotony, lets different characters work through their emotions without turning them into cardboard cutouts. It also somehow makes way for tender moments that don\u2019t feel forced. When Duvall offers the story that explains why she can\u2019t go home while they\u2019re still dotting their i\u2019s and crossing their t\u2019s \u2014 of that battered wife whose husband comes back after his arrest to \u201cfinish what he started\u201d and leaves her brain-damaged \u2014 Merritt Wever delivers it so quietly, so much as if it\u2019s a memory buried under fog that occasionally becomes crystal clear, that it defines the whole show. The scene ends with a quiver of her chin, a flick of her hair, and then her face straightening itself out, and with that this series belongs to her.\n\nRasmussen sees it that way, too \u2014 she undoubtedly lets Duvall handle McCarthy\u2019s arrest on her own for the glory that will accompany it.\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable about the actual arrest is how quietly and easily McCarthy comes in. No running, no evasion, no gun drawn \u2014 he must know that he\u2019s been made and that there\u2019s no point in prolonging things. As his brother puts it, Chris has always been \u201cweird, but a lot of people are weird.\u201d (Then again, it\u2019s rather telling when your sibling\u2019s first instinct is to ask the police if you\u2019ve been building a bomb.) A peek into his room, with its extreme orderliness, is a glimpse into that kind of \u201cweird\u201d mind. In a stack he has Spinoza\u2019s Ethics; Sexy Origins and Intimate Things, Charles Panati\u2019s reference book about sexuality; The Ethical Slut, a guide to polyamory; The Only Astrology Book You\u2019ll Ever Need, which is self-explanatory; and a Bible. He has also catalogued his pursuits: At least a dozen flash drives litter his desktop, along with CD-ROMS magic-markered with names across them, like \u201cSarah.\u201d\n\nIn a reversal of fortune, McCarthy goes from stalking and documenting the lives of the women he attacks to being documented and catalogued himself. His military precision \u2014 those plastic bags with one pair of folded panties apiece \u2014 is matched by the team of detectives picking through all his belongings \u2014 the pink Cyber-Shot, the black Adidas sneakers, the backpack \u2014 and tagging and bagging them. (It\u2019s also worth looking at the real police photos taken from O\u2019Leary\u2019s house to note how exactly the show\u2019s creators copied the objects he owned and used.) And now he has to go through the indignity of complete body scan, to be swabbed and poked just like his victims, to have his pubic hairs ripped out one by one, to be tied up and then left naked, just like we saw Marie. It\u2019s a kind of justice, even if it isn\u2019t complete justice.\n\nWhich is why I\u2019m delighted \u2014 truly delighted \u2014 that they showed McCarthy naked, showed that sad, lonely, swinging penis. In television it\u2019s so often the victim\u2019s body that\u2019s exposed, her clothes torn, her underwear ripped off. In Unbelievable this wasn\u2019t the case. Yes, we got small flashes of their bodies, but for the most part, they weren\u2019t made to perform their trauma. Instead, it\u2019s the rapist\u2019s indignity on display, his body turned into an object to ogle. And damn that feels good.\n\nEspecially since we see how grotesquely he documented his victim\u2019s bodies, and we wonder just what he did with those photos later. Rasmussen and Duvall are perhaps inured to such sights: They hardly bat an eye while they flip through the photos onscreen. But in that last batch their bodies suddenly jolt forward. This body, which looks, like Duvall says, as if it belongs to a 12-year-old, is one they haven\u2019t seen. It\u2019s Marie, of course, with her ID right there to prove it. Three years after her rape, police are finally seeing it for what it is.\n\nWe still don\u2019t know what will happen to her in that interim, if she\u2019ll regain some footing, get a new job, shed some of the lingering trauma \u2014 if such a thing is even possible. Because what we think might be a redemption scene with her court-appointed therapist Dara (played by Brooke Smith) shakes out into something else entirely. Marie tries to run out the clock \u00e0 la Will in Good Will Hunting, but eventually can\u2019t help but ask Dara if she \u201cisn\u2019t even curious\u201d about Marie\u2019s supposed lies. After she unburdens herself, the traditional TV thing to do would be to send Marie on her way, happier and healthier and committed to carrying \u201cthose burdens\u201d that Dara refers to \u201ca little more lightly.\u201d Instead, we get the far more honest truth. If this injustice were to visit Marie again, she \u201cwould lie earlier and better.\u201d And why not? That would have saved her an infinite amount of heartache.", "description": "Chris McCarthy goes from stalking and documenting the lives of the women he attacks to being documented and catalogued himself.
