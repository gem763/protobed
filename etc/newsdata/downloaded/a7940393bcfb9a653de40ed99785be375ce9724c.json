This was just before the fourth-quarter swoon ended last year on a sour note.\n\nAfter she bolted down her portfolio, some of those protections began to yield results. The $64 billion Global Real Return portfolio she manages has gained 10% over the past year, and it sits in the 90th percentile among funds in its peer group according to Bloomberg data.\n\nHer portfolio decisions have been made through the lens of a bull market that's likely in its latter stages, and an economic cycle that is veering into contraction around the world.\n\nShe sees the risks of a market downturn as greater than the odds of a turnaround, thanks to a laundry list of challenges from the trade war to uncertainty around Brexit.\n\nThe natural response from policymakers, in her view, will be to pull out all the stops in order to prevent another financial crisis. Their response would not only need to address financial risks, but also the social inequality that has ramped up since the most recent crisis.\n\nThat leaves nothing off the table, including some sort of income redistribution scheme through taxation, or higher government spending based on Modern Monetary Theory ideals.\n\nRead more: Dan Fuss is revered as 'the Warren Buffett of bonds.'

This possibility, and other nearer-term risks, are the reasons why Hutchins has remained in capital-preservation mode.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, she discussed a few strategies she has adopted to earn returns while hedging against the unexpected.\n\n1. She has increased exposure to gold as a direct hedge against higher inflation. Gold-linked assets including exchange-traded funds now make up 12% of her portfolio, up from about 2% previously. Her biggest holdings include Barrick Gold, Newmont Goldcorp, and Newcrest Mining.\n\n2. Besides these traditional hedges against market turmoil, Hutchins is making some thematic bets that would generate income if they continue to grow.\n\nFor example, she has gained exposure to infrastructure-related projects where she says the return streams are usually stable. Her portfolio includes bonds from Network Rail and HS1, both major operators of railways in the UK.\n\n3. She is also invested in renewable energy via US Solar Fund, a portfolio of power plants across North America.", "description": "The BNY Mellon Global Real Return strategy has outperformed 90% of its peers over the past year despite its cautious outlook.
