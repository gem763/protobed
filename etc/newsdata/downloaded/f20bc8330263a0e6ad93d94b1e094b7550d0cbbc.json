It's been national.\"\n\nThe fine initially stemmed from an NFL uniform infraction, however Davis\u2019 told Fox Nation that he was able to see God\u2019s hand after receiving the fine and the winning the ensuing appeal process.\n\n\"It went from something that was going to cost me $7,000 now went in favor of good, $120,000 and we just took that fine that we were planning on paying to the league and donated it to the cause,\" he said.\n\nFor his part, Davis says he was encouraged by the entire situation, and looks forward to raising more money for the hospital\u2019s emergency department.\n\nThe Collins, Miss. native did admit to initial feelings of confliction, and grappled the idea of simply following the league\u2019s rules or continuing to use his headband as a spiritual message?\n\n\u201cShould I continue to wear it because of the messaging or would I follow the rule? Which would bring ultimate glory to God,\" he explained on the Fox Nation show.\n\nDavis, who just last year signed a three-year deal with the Saints worth $24 million, including $16 million in fully-guaranteed money, said he doesn\u2019t hold a grudges against the NFL for the headband fine before once again emphasizing his purpose to \"glorify God\" in everything he does.\n\nThe NFL did not return Fox Business Network's request for comment.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The Saints linebacker turned a $7,000 fine by the NFL into an opportunity for $120,000 worth of charity.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/DeMario-Davis.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
