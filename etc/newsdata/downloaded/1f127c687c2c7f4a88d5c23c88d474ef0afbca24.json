REUTERS/Ruben Sprich/File Photo\n\nThe company said Nawana, who will be replaced by former Roche Diagnostics head Roland Diggelmann, was leaving to pursue opportunities outside the United Kingdom and his departure was a mutual decision. A spokeswoman gave no additional details.\n\n\u201cThere appears to be a pretty simple reason Nawana is leaving \u2013 pay,\u201d AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.\n\n\u201cIt became apparent over the summer that the company was looking for ways to increase its head honcho\u2019s remuneration with apparent discussions about a move to a U.S. listing to escape an increasing backlash in the UK towards excessive executive pay.\u201d\n\nAn earlier FT report had said Smith+Nephew directors discussed moving the company\u2019s main listing from London to New York, where higher executive payouts are more common and less controversial, to boost its top salaries.\n\nAnalysts at Berenberg also said Nawana\u2019s pay \u201caspirations\u201d made his departure inevitable. Nawana, who steps down at the end of the month, did not respond to request for comment on LinkedIn.\n\nFaced with stricter rules in the United Kingdom designed to tackle soaring executive pay, the company is in talks with shareholders over its 2020 remuneration policy.\n\nNawana, who joined the British maker of artificial knees and hips in May 2018, received total pay of $2.88 million that year, according to the company\u2019s last annual report. His predecessor Olivier Bohuon received $5.12 million in 2017.\n\nSmith+Nephew shares, which have risen 40% since Nawana\u2019s appointment last year, fell 8.2% on Monday.\n\nPRODUCT DIVISIONS\n\nNawana had focused on boosting revenue and profitability by realigning the 160-year-old company\u2019s operations, concentrating on product divisions rather than geographies.\n\nHe was former head of U.S. diagnostics company Alere - where he earned $8.6 mln in 2016 - and overhauled more than half of Smith+Nephew\u2019s leadership team. He hired heads for the company\u2019s main divisions of sports medicine, orthopaedics and wound management to speed up product development.\n\nResults came quickly as the company reported higher than expected half-year profit and boosted its 2019 revenue forecast in July.\n\nAnalysts expect Smith+Nephew\u2019s revenue to rise more than 4% this fiscal year, compared with the 0.8% to 3% growth the company has had over the last three years.\n\nSmith+Nephew is looking to Diggelmann, with more than 20 years in the orthopedics and diagnostics sectors, to continue revenue growth by building on Nawana\u2019s strategy. He has already had a hand in many decisions having been a board member since March last year.\n\n\u201cWe expect (Diggelmann) to pursue a strategy of improving operational execution, something any competitor of Roche Diagnostics would say he did extremely well,\u201d Berenberg analyst Tom Jones said.\n\nHigh executive pay has become a controversial issue in Britain, highlighted by outsized awards such as a $100 million pounds bonus to Jeff Fairburn, chief executive of housebuilder Persimmon (PSN.L). The company said in November he would leave after deciding criticism of the award had become a distraction.\n\nRegulations introduced in January mean listed companies with over 250 employees will have to disclose the ratio of CEO pay to the rest of the company\u2019s workforce, in a move the government said would make companies justify the pay of top bosses.", "description": "Smith+Nephew Plc Chief Executive Namal Nawana is stepping down after just 17 months in the role after becoming dissatisfied with his salary at the medical device maker.", "authors": ["Uday Sampath Kumar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443340961&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0VH", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
