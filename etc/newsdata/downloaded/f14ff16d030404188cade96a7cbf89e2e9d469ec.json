Keep me in this race.\u201d\n\nThe debates require a rising threshold of donor numbers and opinion poll support in order for candidates to be allowed to take part.\n\nOn Friday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ended his 2020 presidential campaign, leaving 19 other Democrats including Booker to vie for the chance to take on Republican Trump.\n\nBooker and his rival Democratic candidates are due to speak later on Saturday at the Polk County Democrats\u2019 annual Steak Fry in Iowa, which will hold its presidential caucus on Feb. 3.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Cory Booker speaks at the One Iowa and GLAAD LGBTQ Presidential Forum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, September 20, 2019. REUTERS/Scott Morgan\n\nDemissie told reporters that the funds would be invested in campaign operations in October and November to better ensure success in next year\u2019s early voting states and Super Tuesday primaries.\n\nHe dismissed Booker\u2019s weak poll numbers, predicting that the Democrat\u2019s efforts in early voting states would quickly change the dynamics once voters start casting ballots next year, if he could raise the funds necessary to stay in the race.\n\n\u201cThe final field that is going to be offered to the Democratic Party come February, March and April and beyond, is being determined right now, here, in September,\u201d he said.", "description": "U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker will drop out of the running for his party's 2020 White House nomination unless he can raise $1.7 million over the next 10 days, his campaign said on Saturday.", "authors": ["David Morgan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432381412&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K0NP", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
