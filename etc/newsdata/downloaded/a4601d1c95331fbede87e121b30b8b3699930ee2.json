But according to lawyers for one of his accusers, the league has said \"it will continue to investigate all claims regarding his behavior.\"\n\nJust two days after Brown signed with the Patriots, a former physical trainer filed a civil lawsuit accusing Brown of three sexually assaulting her three separate times.\n\nThe woman, Britney Taylor, met with National Football League investigators Monday.\n\nThe NFL has not taken any disciplinary action so far against Brown, who has denied Taylor's claims.\n\nTaylor's lawyers declined to comment on his release by the Patriots.\n\nThe Patriots allowed Brown to play and kept him on the team on the heels of Taylor's allegations. And he remained on the team after another woman, an artist, was quoted in a Sports Illustrated article saying Brown had made an unwanted sexual advance on her and fired her after she did not reciprocate.\n\nBut on Thursday, Sports Illustrated published a new story saying that the woman on Wednesday had received what she took as intimidating text messages from Brown on the heels of the magazine's first story about her claims.\n\n\"The text chain, with four other phone numbers on it, included photos of her and her children, with the person she believes is Brown encouraging others in the group to investigate the woman,\" reported Sports Illustrated, which has not identified the woman.\n\nOn Friday, shortly before Brown's release, lawyers for that woman, Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, said that the NFL had promised to them that the league would contact the Patriots about the text messages.\n\nThe lawyers also said that the NFL had \"pledged to conduct a thorough investigation under its Personal Conduct Policy,\" and advised us that the Patriots directed Mr. Brown to have no further contact with our client, either directly or through his associates.\"\n\nAnd, \"The NFL also advised us that it contacted Mr. Brown's representative and reiterated that Mr. Brown was to cease and desist efforts to contact or intimidate our client,\" Banks and Katz said.\n\nKatz last year represented Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct when they were high school students in the 1980s.\n\nBanks and Katz, in a statement about Brown's release, said: \"The NFL and the Patriots clearly took our client's concerns seriously. She wanted the threats and intimidation to stop and we hope that will be [the] case.\"\n\n\"The NFL has assured us that regardless of Antonio Brown's roster status, it will continue to investigate all claims regarding his behavior.\"\n\n\"We are gratified that the NFL recognized that it has an important role to play in policing player conduct that is sexually harassing and threatening,\" the lawyers said.", "description": "The New England Patriots released Antonio Brown just 11 days after signing the wide receiver.
