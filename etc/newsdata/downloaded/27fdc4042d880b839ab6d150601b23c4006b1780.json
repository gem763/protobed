He may be literature\u2019s first cyborg.", "language": "en", "text": "Critic\n\nLast January, I wrote briefly about 18 books from 1923 that had entered the public domain. One of these, \u201cThe Clockwork Man,\u201d by E.V. Odle, particularly caught my attention, in part because it was reportedly the first novel ever published about a cyborg. I subsequently researched \u201cThe Clockwork Man\u201d to find out more. After learning that Brian Stableford \u2014 our leading historian of British science fiction \u2014 had once named it the work he would most like to see rediscovered, that was enough for me.\n\nI quickly bought a paperback of Odle\u2019s only novel from HiLobrow publishers, which reissues the book in its line of \u201cRadium Age Science Fiction.\u201d This edition features an excellent introduction by Annalee Newitz, who opens with a funny but accurate summary of the novel:\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop making war on each other, one day women will team up with benevolent, naked aliens and implant you with a clock that controls your behavior and sends you into a timeless multiverse. Oh and also? That timeless multiverse will be full of hat and wig stores.\u201d\n\nIs \u201cThe Clockwork Man,\u201d then, serious or slapstick? In fact, it\u2019s both, very much in the manner of H.G. Wells\u2019s comparably serio-comic \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d and \u201cThe First Men in the Moon.\u201d\n\n[1923 and me: A critic picks some favorite books now in the public domain]\n\nAs the novel begins, Arthur Withers notices something odd during a village cricket match. On a nearby hill, a peculiar jiggling figure has suddenly appeared, apparently from out of nowhere. Its \u201carms revolved like sails of a windmill. Its legs shot out in all directions.\u201d Arthur cautiously proceeds to investigate. \u201cThe strange figure wore a wig. It was a very red wig, and over the top of it was jammed a brown bowler hat. The face underneath was crimson and flabby.\u201d This Buster Keaton-like fellow also flaps his ears.\n\nTo a polite greeting from Arthur the stranger answers:\n\n\u201cWallabaloo-Wallabaloo-Bompadi \u2014 Wum. Wum \u2014 Wum \u2014 nine and ninepence \u2014 .\u201d\n\nTo which, Arthur naturally responds, \u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2018Wullabaloo,\u2019 replied the other, eagerly. \u2018Walla\u2014 Oh, hang it\u2014Hulloa, now we\u2019ve got it \u2014 Wullabaloo \u2014 No, we haven\u2019t \u2014 Bang Wallop \u2014 nine and ninepence.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAt this point, Arthur hears what \u201csounded like a hundred alarum clocks all going off at once, muffled somehow but concentrated. It was a sort of whirring, low and spasmodic at first, but broadening out into something more regular, less frantic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only my clock,\u201d says the stranger, who clearly isn\u2019t from the next village. Or even our own time. As for those mechanical tics and spasms, they augur an approaching breakdown. The rest of the novel revolves around the Clockwork Man\u2019s efforts to repair himself and return to full functionality.\n\nAt first, Odle keeps everything mildly farcical. When the Clockwork Man joins the cricket match, he knocks the ball out of the park. When told to run, he takes off in a straight line, accelerating faster and faster like the cartoon Road Runner until he disappears over the horizon. Gradually, though, Odle introduces his cyborg to a cross-section of typical English folk, notably the fogeyish Dr. Allingham, who has begun to worry about his impending marriage to Miss Lillian Payne: \u201cInstead of charming little notes inviting him to tea he now received long, and, he was obliged to admit, quite excellent essays upon the true place of woman in modern life.\u201d\n\nWhen the Clockwork Man reappears, he explains that he must have \u201clapsed. Slipped . . . back about eight thousand years, so far as I can make out.\u201d Though stranded here for the moment, he continues, \u201cI am capable of going not only someplace but also somewhen,\u201d moving effortlessly through all dimensions. About to listen to a story, he affably remarks, \u201cBegin at the end, if you like . . . It\u2019s all the same to me. First and last, upside or inside, front or back \u2014 it all conveys the same idea to me.\u201d\n\nBecause the Clockwork Man upsets so many conventions and beliefs, Odle\u2019s various characters soon take to arguing about technology, evolution, sex, woman\u2019s role in society, free will and humankind\u2019s destiny. The Clockwork Man contends that \u201cit was not until man began to respect the machines that his real history began.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, during a bizarre surgical examination, Allingham discovers a slip of paper: \u201cThe Clockwork Man. Directions for Use.\u201d Is the supposed Ubermensch actually \u201ca very elaborate and highly complex puppet\u201d?\n\nOnly in the book\u2019s final pages does Odle extinguish the last vestiges of humor. The cyborg happens upon Arthur and his sweetheart Rose:\n\n\u201cDown the smooth surface of the Clockwork Man\u2019s face there rolled two enormous tears. They descended each cheek simultaneously, keeping exact pace.\u201d Asked about his distress, he answers, \u201cI remember now . . . all that old business \u2014 before we became fixed, you know. But they had to leave it out. It would have made the clock too complicated. Besides it wasn\u2019t necessary, you see. The clock kept you going for ever. The splitting up process went out of fashion, the splitting up of yourself into little bits that grew up like you \u2014 offspring, they used to call them.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cNo children. No love \u2014 nothing but going on for ever, spinning in infinite space and knowledge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Clockwork Man\u201d closes on a bleak vision of the future that quite undercuts all that initial comedy. Overall, though, Odle\u2019s novel is more about choices than fixed destinies. One critic even sees it as a subtle metafiction about the relationship between actual people and the people in books. \u201cWe readers should enjoy our humanity,\u201d suggests Richard Bleiler, \u201cfor such is denied to fictional characters who have no free will and are no more than Clockwork men.\u201d Perhaps. Whatever the case, given ongoing advances in robotics and medical technology, not to mention the possibility of uploading consciousness into a computer, \u201cThe Clockwork Man\u201d seems, so to speak, both timely and alarming.\n\nMichael Dirda reviews books each Thursday in Style.", "description": "E.V.
