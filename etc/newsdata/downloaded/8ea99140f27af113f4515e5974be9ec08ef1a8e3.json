She will make investments out of the venture capital firm\u2019s bio fund, which closed on $450 million in 2017.\n\nYoo spent the last eight years as a co-founder and chief product officer of Kyruus, a venture-backed healthcare provider matching tool. She\u2019s joins as a16z\u2019s 17th GP; the firm hired David George, who focuses on late-stage deals, and Anish Acharya, who specializes in fintech deals, as GPs earlier this year.\n\nMore notably, Yoo becomes the fourth female general partner at a firm that for years had only men at the top of its ranks. The Slack investor hired its first-ever female GP, Katie Haun, in June 2018 to lead its crypto efforts alongside Chris Dixon. Longtime a16z investors Connie Chan and Angela Strange were later promoted to GP.\n\nYoo joins Vijay Pande and Jorge Conde on a16z\u2019s biotech investment team. The trio will focus on life sciences, synthetic bio and broader health tech.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve focused on these three areas we\u2019ve realized it\u2019s a pretty broad opportunity,\u201d Conde tells TechCrunch. \u201cWe wanted to find a GP that had the phenotype of what we look for in all of our GPs \u2026 and someone who has deep operating expertise that knows how to build companies.\u201d\n\nBefore co-founding Kyruus, Yoo was the vice president of product at Generation Health, a CVS-acquired health management company. In her first role as a venture capitalist, Yoo says she will identify investments in companies transforming access to our healthcare system.\n\n\u201cWe are an extension of the phrase \u2018software is eating the world,\u2019 \u201d Yoo tells TechCrunch. \u201cWe are focused on software eating care delivery and everything that flows from that.\u201d\n\nAmong a16z\u2019s health and bio investments is Devoted Health, which helps Medicare beneficiaries access care through its network of physicians and tech-enabled healthcare platform. Other investments in the space include Freenome, a liquid biopsy diagnostics platform; Apeel, which makes a kind of plant food-based barrier for fruit that aims to replace wax coatings; a care coordination network called PatientPing; and BioAge Labs, a company that\u2019s trying to find drugs that extend humans\u2019 health span through machine learning and biomarkers that speed up the discovery process.", "description": "Julie Yoo will make investments out of the firm's bio fund.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-598748714.jpg?w=600", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
