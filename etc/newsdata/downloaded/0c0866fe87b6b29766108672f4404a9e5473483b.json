However, that standard was discredited after many of the world\u2019s biggest investment banks pled guilty or paid large sums to settle accusations that they colluded to rig Libor and other benchmarks.\n\nLast week Bank of China sold $350 million in three-year floating rate notes linked to the Secured Overnight Fundraising Rate (SOFR), a relatively new rate published by the New York Federal Reserve and tipped to replace U.S. dollar Libor. It was the first such offering from Asia\u2019s private sector.\n\nWhile the BOC\u2019s issue was relatively small, bankers involved in the deal said they expected it will open the market for other borrowers.\n\nChristophe Cretot, head of debt origination and advisory, Asia-Pacific at Credit Agricole CIB, was involved in the deal and said the BOC\u2019s SOFR tranche was \u201cdefensively sized\u201d to allow underwriters to sound out interest in the new securities.\n\n\u201cWe were positively surprised by the level of response that we got from the investors, it was better than we had anticipated,\u201d he said. However, he acknowledged many banks and investors in Asia did not yet have systems in place to process SOFR transactions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not expecting SOFR linked bonds to become the norm tomorrow, but we expect to see more and more of these in 2020,\u201d Cretot said.\n\nShifting new and existing contracts to use the new rates is a major challenge for investors, banks, and many bond issuers. Libor underpins hundreds of trillions of dollars of existing derivative contracts, loans and bonds around the world.\n\nSOFR is based on the pricing of rates in the Treasury repurchase market and was first published last year.\n\nAsia currently lags North America and Europe in preparing for the end of Libor, currently due in 2021, and companies in the region have also lagged peers elsewhere in selling bonds linked to SOFR or any of the other new rates intended to replace British pound Libor or Euribor.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that pace of (adoption of new interest rate benchmarks) will be non-linear,\u201d said Tim Galt, head of debt capital market syndicate at UBS. \u201cWe are likely to see steady progress followed by a sharp acceleration in adoption, leaving early movers well placed\u201d he added.", "description": "Bankers are readying Asian clients to issue more bonds linked to the new interest rate benchmarks replacing Libor after Bank of China sold the first such private sector deal in the region last week.", "authors": ["Alun John", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
