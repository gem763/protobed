I\u2019m damaged\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Britain\u2019s pioneering former fighter and five-time world champion, who won a landmark case for women in 1998, is rediscovering her lust for life after enduring a torrid time in the sport\n\n\u201cI just think I\u2019m damaged, like really damaged,\u201d Jane Couch says quietly as the tears roll down her face. She hunches over and her body shakes. This is the painful cost of being the pioneer of women\u2019s boxing in Britain. Couch was the five-time world champion boxer who was barred from fighting in her own country. Just over 20 years ago the British Boxing Board of Control still insisted women were too emotionally unstable to box.\n\nOn my way to meet Couch I hear that Katie Taylor, the brilliant Irish boxer, will headline a bill at the Manchester Arena on 2 November with Anthony Crolla, a former world champion and much-loved Mancunian, on her undercard. Without Couch\u2019s courage and defiance, Taylor would not be in this position.\n\nThe boxing dentist: a fighter who breaks and remakes teeth for a living Read more\n\nCouch had to win a court case against the sport\u2019s governing body to make British sporting history in August 1998. Bernard Buckley, the board\u2019s solicitor, built his case on the claim that \u201cmany women suffer from premenstrual tension which makes them more emotional and more labile and accident-prone. They are too fragile to box and they bruise easily.\u201d\n\nBut Couch had shown her mettle to win her first world title in only her fifth fight in 1996. She had flown to Denmark to face Sandra Geiger, the French world champion who came from a kickboxing background. Couch suffered a broken jaw, shattered cheekbone, fractured eye-socket, cracked ribs and a missing tooth but she still won a unanimous decision over 10 rounds. She and Geiger both ended up in hospital.\n\nHer world titles and landmark legal victory were of little benefit to Couch. She still struggled to get fights and there were many times when she travelled abroad and, after brutal bouts, was not even paid. At home Couch was shunned by boxing promoters and mocked on television and in the tabloids.\n\nIf I had known what it would cost me I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it. I gave up everything. I didn\u2019t even get into a proper relationship until I was 41\n\nI have known Couch since the late 1990s, when I first interviewed her, and she is one of the most admirable and kindest people I\u2019ve met in boxing. She retired 10 years ago but today, as she relives the past trauma, her usual laughter is replaced by grief. When we take a break, because it is so upsetting for her, Couch says simply: \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t been the first. I wish I hadn\u2019t gone through all that shit.\u201d\n\nCouch nods when I ask if it\u2019s OK to continue. \u201cI want to,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if I had known what it would cost me I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it. I gave up everything. I didn\u2019t even get into a proper relationship until I was 41. I was my own worst enemy because I\u2019d just argue with [promoters] Frank Maloney and Frank Warren. I\u2019d be like: \u2018I\u2019m not frightened of you. Fuck the pair of you. I\u2019ll fight in France, Germany or America.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe 51-year-old Couch looks up when I say her scars seem more like wounds. \u201cI\u2019m damaged,\u201d she says again. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was but the counsellors and doctors encourage you to talk. They say: \u2018It\u2019s good to get it out. If you hold it in, Jane, you\u2019ll only do more damage.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe wipes her eyes and apologises for crying. Yet her tears are a sign of strength. They show her candour and fight. \u201cI hope so. I just find it hard. It hurts my pride to talk this openly but I don\u2019t think people realise the damage they did. Most of them had never met me and they\u2019d call me a lesbian or a freak.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jane Couch on her way to beating Australia\u2019s Sharon Anyos for the WBF lightweight title in 1999, the year after winning her case against the British Board of Boxing Control. Photograph: John Gichigi/Getty Images\n\nAt the heart of Couch\u2019s engaging new book, The Final Round, she details the legal battle she waged against the boxing board which peddled views of women more suited to the 1890s than the 1990s. Her victory changed sport in this country but Couch shakes her head. \u201cDon\u2019t credit me with women\u2019s boxing. All credit goes to them two women [who represented her]. Sarah Leslie, the solicitor who died of breast cancer at 42, and Dinah Rose, the top sex-discrimination barrister in the country by a mile. We were all young and one of the journalists wrote that we looked like three lesbians. I apologised to Dinah and Sarah because they\u2019re middle-class women. They went: \u2018Jane, it\u2019s terrible.\u2019 I was like: \u2018This isn\u2019t that bad compared to what I\u2019ve been through.\u2019\n\nThree years before I retired I would just sit on my own, crying. I couldn\u2019t see a way out\n\n\u201cDinah messed them up because they thought she was going only on sex discrimination. She used that but focused on restraint of trade. I was already a double world champion and the board was stopping me making a living in this country. We won but, when I got the licence, I thought: \u2018It will be all right now.\u2019 The abuse got worse. Dinah knew it would happen. We left the press conference after the court case. She put her arms around me and goes: \u2018I don\u2019t want to tell you this, but your fight\u2019s just beginning.\u2019\u201d\n\nCouch\u2019s eyes are clear again. \u201cI know what she means now. I\u2019d be on TV shows like Richard and Judy and they would have phone-ins for people to vote. \u2018Is she a freak? Should she be allowed to box?\u2019 When people keep calling you a freak you think, \u2018Maybe I am?\u2019 Three years before I retired I would just sit on my own, crying. I couldn\u2019t see a way out.\u201d\n\nA year after she retired, in 2008, Couch had a breakdown. \u201cI was very down. I didn\u2019t want to go out. I was having panic attacks. Other women fighters were sending me messages about their problems. I had pains in my chest like I was having a heart attack.\u201d\n\nA friend took Couch to hospital and \u201cthis amazing lady doctor told me I was having a panic attack. I was like: \u2018How can I have a panic attack? I\u2019m not scared of anything.\u2019 I told her what I did and she said: \u2018You\u2019ve got to bury boxing otherwise this will always haunt you.\u2019\u201d\n\nCouch held a private little funeral for her boxing career in a graveyard. She tried to bury it, at least in her head if not the ground below her feet. It was an important symbolic step. \u201cThat night I slept properly for the first time. I started to think differently but it took two years on the [antidepressant] pills. Now I\u2019m getting counselling and I\u2019ve been off the pills for eight months. I\u2019m feeling brilliant.\u201d\n\nWriting her book, and talking about it, has been distressing but Couch knows this is the road to lasting peace. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a skilful boxer. I fought with my heart. I learned that in the gym because I had to be tough \u2013 sparring with boys. Those first days in the gym were bad. They\u2019d say: \u2018Fuck off, you\u2019re a girl.\u2019 They laughed at me. They\u2019re all skipping brilliant and I\u2019m tripping over the rope. I could hear them laughing but I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019ll show you.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest WIBF light welterweight world title holder Jane Couch, pictured in July 1998. Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Guardian\n\nShe laughs at her youthful audacity. Before her first world title fight against Geiger she trained for nine months and sparred against well-known male professionals such as Glenn Catley and Dean Francis. \u201cGlenn was a serious puncher but he was good with me. They were all good with me but they still hit me. They\u2019d be no good to me if they didn\u2019t. They taught me to fight back when you\u2019re hurt.\u201d\n\nGeiger was so well-known in France that, as Couch says, \u201cThe president of France [Jacques Chirac] was there when we fought. He gave her the belt but she took a hell of a beating. We both did. I had a metal plate in my cheekbone and I was pissing blood for three weeks after.\u201d\n\nNot one line about her becoming world champion was written in the national press or mentioned on radio or television. \u201cI thought I was going to get mobbed at the airport but no one was there. I got Boxing News that next Friday. I was all excited but there was nothing. My manager shrugged. \u2018They don\u2019t do women\u2019s boxing.\u2019 He was as bad as them. A week later he said: \u2018You\u2019ve got a defence in New Orleans.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even want to go back to the gym but I convinced myself.\u201d\n\nCouch cleared \u00a3200, after expenses were deducted, for winning the world title. But the New Orleans promoter said he had no money to pay her after she won another hard fight. At least she ended up having Angelo Dundee, Muhammad Ali\u2019s trainer, and the great former world champion Matthew Saad Muhammad helping in her corner. Couch also talks about the kindness of Marvin Hagler and Lennox Lewis, and her friendships with Frank Bruno and Ricky Hatton. But her love of boxing has soured.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t right a few years before I retired. I went on too long. We did the brain scan. They said: \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve had a slight alteration.\u2019 I knew that meant brain damage. They said: \u2018If you carry on taking blows it will get progressively worse.\u2019 That\u2019s why I retired.\u201d\n\nDoes she feel any side-effects now? \u201cYeah. The memory\u2019s a bit bad. But that\u2019s most fighters, isn\u2019t it? Physically I\u2019m not too bad but I became institutionalised, I think, to the other damage.\u201d\n\nMany former fighters suffer from depression and Couch believes \u201cboxing is definitely a factor. So many of my old sparring partners are in prison or on drugs or alcoholics. There\u2019s got to be some connection with boxing when you look at all the lads in jail or on drugs.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Couch after her points defeat to Lucia Rijker in Los Angeles in 2003. \u2018I was swallowing blood and it made a cracking sound,\u2019 she recalls. \u2018I thought: seven rounds to go. The damage is done. I might as well carry on.\u2019 Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\nCouch\u2019s toughest fight was against Lucia Rijker in Los Angeles in 2003. Rijker is arguably the greatest female boxer in history and Couch survived 10 rounds despite having an eardrum perforated. \u201cI thought I was brain-damaged because there was a roaring in my head and my balance was totally gone. I was swallowing blood and it made a cracking sound. I thought: \u2018Seven rounds to go. The damage is done. I might as well carry on.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter all the pain she suffered for such little reward does she feel any envy when hearing about Taylor\u2019s headlining show? \u201cNot a bit because I\u2019ve buried it all now. What Katie\u2019s done for boxing and women in Ireland is massive. I know because my fella\u2019s Irish. She\u2019s a superstar and that\u2019s how it should be. It just wasn\u2019t like that for me \u2013 or most women boxers today. I had a girl telling me her fight\u2019s been cancelled because she didn\u2019t sell enough tickets. That\u2019s more typical of women\u2019s boxing. It\u2019s even been tough for Nicola Adams.\u201d\n\nNicola Adams: \u2018I jumped in front of my mother and tried to protect her\u2019 Read more\n\nWhen she won gold at the London Olympics in 2012, Adams made a point of acknowledging her success would not have been possible without Couch carving out a path before her. British boxing\u2019s great female pioneer is still fighting to win her own battle to overcome everything that boxing did to her. Does she feel as if she is winning?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting there,\u201d she says with a little smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been with my partner Brian for nine years. We\u2019re so happy. It\u2019s helping me find a way out of boxing. It\u2019s hard \u2013 but I\u2019m happy when I\u2019m not talking about boxing.\u201d\n\nJane Couch\u2019s The Final Round is published by Pitch", "description": "Britain\u2019s pioneering former fighter and five-time world champion, who won a landmark case for women in 1998, tells Donald McRae she is rediscovering her lust for life after a torrid time in the sport", "authors": ["Donald Mcrae"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4df9c62eed2868176815582ea79ead6838964c3/0_370_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=068a406fb584472fd983b63696e00d9b", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
