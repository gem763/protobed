After many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this.\n\nUnfortunately, with no detail from BALPA on which pilots would strike, we had no way of predicting how many would come to work or which aircraft they are qualified to fly, so we had no option but to cancel nearly 100 per cent our flights.\n\nWe remain ready and willing to return to talks with BALPA.\n\nOur customer teams \u2013 supported by additional colleagues \u2013 have been working tirelessly to help as many of you as possible and to provide options, including a full refund or re-booking to a different date of travel or alternative airline.\n\nWe are offering all affected customers full refunds or the option to re-book to another date of travel or alternative airline.", "description": "British Airways pilots that are members of the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa)\u00a0have walked out for the second day in a 48-hour strike\u00a0over pay.
