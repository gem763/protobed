Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman star as Kelly and Carlson.\n\nThe film deals with the fall of a media mogul, the culture of Fox News, and the sensitive topic of sexual harassment, and so far it's generated rave reviews and few complaints thanks to performances by its star-studded cast.\n\nVariety reporters Marc Malkin and Angelique Jackson said Theron's performance as Megyn Kelly could earn her a second Oscar.\n\n\"Up until Sunday, it seemed like Ren\u00e9e Zellweger was going to sail through awards season picking up one honor after another before taking home her second Academy Award in February,\" Malkin and Jackson wrote. \"However, Theron could be serious competition for Zellweger.\"\n\nTheron reportedly worked to portray Kelly as accurately as possible, even altering her voice to match the anchor's.\n\n\"The entire cast is incredible but Charlize disappears into the role of Megyn,\" Hollywood Reporter senior film editor Piya Sinha-Roy wrote. \"That Oscar race just got more interesting.\"\n\nLos Angeles Times film critic Katie Walsh said the \"Bombshell\" main characters \u2060are \"morally complex\" heroines who surprise viewers in their attempts to do the right thing. Walsh called Theron's performance \"unreal.\"\n\nCritics are also buzzing about Margot Robbie for her supporting performance as a Fox employee. Her character is a fictional composite of several women, but Robbie still tackles \"the film's most significant sex-harassment scene,\" New York Times writer Kyle Buchanan wrote in a tweet.\n\nVariety predicted Kidman could pick up a supporting actress nomination and that John Lithgow, who plays Ailes, is a strong contender for best supporting actor.\n\nKara Warner, who writes for People Magazine, described the film as \"powerful,\" \"intense,\" \"appropriately uncomfortable,\" and \"empowering.\" Scott Mantz, the cofounder of the LA Online Film Critics Society, also said \"Bombshell\" is empowering and called out Theron, Kidman, and Robbie for their \"superb\" performances.\"\n\nSome fellow actors and writers who attended the screening also sung the cast's praises.\n\nHere's what those in the audience had to say about \"Bombshell\":\n\n\u2014Shaya Tayefe Mohajer (@Shaya_in_LA) October 14, 2019", "description": "'Bombshell,' which depicts the fall of Fox News boss Roger Ailes amid claims of sexual harassment, was well-received by critics for 'superb' performances.", "authors": ["Alyssa Meyers"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4c29fcc4a0a195f27a5e8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
