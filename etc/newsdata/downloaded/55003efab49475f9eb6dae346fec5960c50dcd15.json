In a phone call with Mr Johnson, he said the commission would examine the UK\u2019s legal text \u201cobjectively, and in light of our well-known criteria\u201d.

If there is not, Mr Johnson will be confronted with the choice of going ahead with his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to crash out of the EU without a deal on 31 October or asking Brussels for further delay.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A \u201cStormont lock\u201d gives the assembly and executive in Belfast powers to pull out in 2025, but means the plan is dependent on the suspended institutions being restored by June next year.\n\nBoth sides would have to commit to avoiding checkpoints on the border under Mr Johnson\u2019s proposals. But there would be customs checks on all goods travelling between the Republic and the North \u2013 except for some exempted small traders \u2013 carried out either electronically or through physical examinations in traders\u2019 premises or in the supply chain.\n\nA \u201cNew Deal for Northern Ireland\u201d will funnel funds towards infrastructure and business investment in the province, on top of the \u00a31bn supplied as a result of the DUP\u2019s 2017 deal to prop up Theresa May\u2019s government.\n\nThe pound tumbled during the day amid jitters over Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan.\n\nAnd trade group Manufacturing Northern Ireland said the proposal was \u201cworse than no deal for Northern Ireland businesses\u201d.\n\nTariffs on north-south trade would mean the crucial farming and agrifood sector would be \u201cdecimated\u201d, while businesses near the border would be cut off from their customers and supply chains, said the group.\n\nThe Johnson proposals were welcomed by the Democratic Unionist Party as \u201ca basis for the EU to continue in a serious and sustained engagement with the UK\u201d. The 10 DUP MPs are vital to the prime minister's slim hopes of getting a majority in the Commons behind his plans.\n\nBut Ulster Unionists described the proposals as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said they were \u201cneither viable nor acceptable\u201d.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn denounced the plan as \u201cworse than Theresa May\u2019s\u201d, warning it would take the UK into \u201ca regime of deregulation and undercutting\u201d and undermine the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nAnd Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson Tom Brake said: \u201cThese proposals just confirm what we already know \u2013 Boris Johnson has no viable alternative to the backstop.\n\n\u201cIt is ludicrous to think that somehow Boris Johnson believes the answer to ensuring no Irish border is to create two.\u201d\n\nIn a four-page letter to Mr Juncker, Mr Johnson described his plan as a \u201cfair and reasonable compromise\u201d which could provide the basis for \u201crapid negotiations towards a solution\u201d so the UK can leave in an orderly way on Halloween.\n\n\u201cThe government wants to get a deal, as I am sure we all do. If we cannot get one, it would represent a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible,\u201d he told Mr Juncker. \u201cOur predecessors have tackled harder problems: we can surely solve this one.\u201d\n\nAnd he wrote: \u201cBoth sides now need to consider whether there is sufficient willingness to compromise and move beyond existing positions to get us to an agreement in time. We are ready to do that, and this letter sets out what I regard as a reasonable compromise: the broad landing zone in which I believe a deal can begin to take shape.\u201d\n\nLabour MP Mary Creagh, a prominent supporter of the People\u2019s Vote campaign for a second EU referendum, said Johnson\u2019s proposed deal \u201cbreaks every promise he made to people in the referendum campaign and the solemn promises we made to the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the Good Friday Agreement\u201d.\n\nIn place of the \u201cfrictionless\u201d trade promised by Vote Leave in 2016, Mr Johnson was offering \u201ccustoms barriers in Ireland and at ports around the UK\u201d, she said.\n\nShe added that the prime minister\u2019s rejection of a level playing field on regulation would make the UK \u201cthe bargain basement of Europe, with the worst paid workers relying on minimum wage laws, with the lowest taxes for the wealthy, and a return to being the dirty man of Europe \u2013 where polluters from home and abroad can dump their waste\u201d.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to take the UK out of the European Union at the end of this month would impose two new borders on Northern Ireland, to the horror of local businesses.
