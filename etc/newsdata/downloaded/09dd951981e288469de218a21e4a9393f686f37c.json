REUTERS/Manaure Quintero\n\nNow back at his four-room house in the western city of Maracaibo, hard-hit by Venezuela\u2019s protracted political and economic crisis, the boy\u2019s hopes center on his own version of the American Dream.\n\n\u201cI want to make the big leagues and help my mother, so we can buy a house and get away from this,\u201d Salcedo said in an interview.\n\nProfessional baseball, which is wildly popular in parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, has long been viewed as a path out of poverty. And players from the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Cuba and Puerto Rico make up more than 20% of current big league rosters, according to Major League Baseball (MLB).\n\nBut Salcedo said his trip to the United States \u2014 whose government is seeking to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro through economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure \u2014 highlighted some of the extraordinary challenges he and his teammates face.\n\n\u201cThe ballplayers over there (in the U.S.) are fat, and they\u2019re not tired,\u201d Salcedo said, alluding to Venezuela\u2019s growing problems stemming from malnutrition and hunger.\n\nKids from other countries he spoke to during the tournament in Williamsport, Pennsylvania - the world\u2019s biggest youth baseball event - were aware of the problems facing Venezuela, said Salcedo, a lanky and soft-spoken left fielder.\n\n\u201cThey asked us how we put up with all this,\u201d he said, referring to Venezuela\u2019s increasing state of decay.\n\nSalcedo and 13 other players from Venezuela\u2019s Cacique Mara team qualified for the Little League World Series by winning a national championship and then a Latin America-wide tournament in Panama. They went on to beat Australia and Mexico before crashing out of the World Series with a loss to Curacao.\n\nOn their return home, late last month, the players were greeted by family members cheering and holding signs at the airport in Maracaibo, Venezuela\u2019s second-largest city.\n\nOnce the bustling oil capital of the OPEC nation, the city now regularly goes more than eight hours a day without power under a rationing plan that affects everything from running water to internet connectivity.\n\nMany businesses have shut down since a wave of lootings during a prolonged power outage in March, leaving a cityscape marked by boarded-up storefronts and abandoned buildings.\n\nTwo days after returning to Maracaibo, Salcedo woke up in the middle of the night after a power outage knocked out his fan, leaving him tossing and turning in the Caribbean heat.\n\nHe was so tired the next day that his mother, 44-year-old single homemaker Diana Nunez, had to browbeat him into doing his workout routine, which includes a makeshift weightlifting session with two sand-filled bottles strung to a pole.\n\nNunez said she used to serve her son beef or chicken every day, but lately she can only buy meat three times a week.\n\nUnlike the well-manicured U.S. ballparks, the field where Cacique Mara practices has no grass. A pump that used to irrigate it was stolen two years ago and lights, which once allowed teams to practice at night, have been out for years.\n\nFunding for the U.S. trip and visa expenses, both for Cacique Mara\u2019s little league team and for a younger division that won a Latin America-wide championship in Mexico in early August, was a challenge.\n\nUltimately, the teams had to rely almost entirely on contributions from Venezuelan major leaguers and complimentary tickets from airlines due to a lack of support from the cash-strapped government, according to Cacique Mara director Daniel Gutierrez.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like this before, but now even gloves and cleats are luxuries,\u201d Gutierrez said.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s Youth and Sports Ministry and the government\u2019s Information Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. But Pedro Infante, the minister for youth and sports, has blamed the U.S. \u201ceconomic and financial blockade\u201d on Venezuela for preventing the government from importing equipment and paying for athletes to travel overseas.\n\nBaseball was briefly ensnared in the diplomatic dispute between Caracas and Washington last month, when the MLB banned players from participating in the upcoming Venezuelan professional league season due to U.S. sanctions.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived in the United States I was impressed,\u201d said outfielder Eduar Pinto, 12, who enjoyed going out to eat and playing in the game room in the team\u2019s dorm in Williamsport.\n\n\u201cWhen the time came to return, I didn\u2019t want to come back. I wanted to stay there.\u201d\n\nWhile players\u2019 families often struggle to buy them everything they need, relief could be on the way soon for at least some of Cacique Mara\u2019s stars. Many are aiming to join one of Maracaibo\u2019s numerous private baseball academies, which provide players with food and equipment in exchange for a cut of any eventual professional contract they may sign.\n\nSuch contracts are far from guaranteed in the hyper-competitive world of sports, however, and Nunez acknowledged her son may have to put his hopes on hold.\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t make the major leagues, it doesn\u2019t matter to me, but I want him to study, to be a professional,\u201d said Nunez, whose brother - like more than 1 million other Venezuelans - has migrated to neighboring Colombia to find work and help the family.\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t graduate, he\u2019s not going to get a job. Let\u2019s hope that by then, Venezuela will have gotten better.\u201d\n\nPhoto essay here reut.rs/2lTbDO0", "description": "While playing for Venezuela in baseball's Little League World Series in the United States last month, 12-year-old Adrian Salcedo ate tacos and Chick-fil-A, donned a virtual reality headset to envision himself hitting home runs in big league ballparks and marveled at the lush grass of the fields.", "authors": ["Luc Cohen", "Mariela Nava", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431257321&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H14E-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
