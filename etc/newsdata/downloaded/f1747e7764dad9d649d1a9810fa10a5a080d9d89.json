Operating in the 5GHz band appears to be the best choice for consumers under all circumstances.\"\n\n\"The 5GHz band also has the benefit of more recent technology developments which includes features such as directional beamforming and MU/MIMO (with up to eight antennas and multiuser sub-channels).\"\n\nRelated coverage", "description": "It comes just as the federal government has issued the reallocation of 2.4GHz spectrum in the 26GHz band.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/25/29ed718f-e4b9-402f-bd0a-6bff50acfe94/thumbnail/770x578/526d1838e29d88341f51ff47b163abc8/istock-cell-tower.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
