Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who called it a \u201cshitshow.\u201d Even the hosts of Trump\u2019s favorite TV show, \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d turned on him over the move \u2015 or as Oliver called them, \u201chis cheerleaders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. You know things are bad for Trump when he\u2019s even lost the support of \u2018Fox & Friends,\u2019\u201d Oliver said, giving the show a sycophantic new slogan:\n\nLove HuffPost?
