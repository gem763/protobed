But Democrats will soon start holding public hearings with impeachment witnesses and releasing transcripts from their closed-door interviews, complicating the GOP\u2019s strategy.\n\nIn fact, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Monday that the House would vote this week to formalize the next phase of their impeachment probe, a step that the California Democrat argued was necessary \u201cto eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump Administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing\u201d House investigators.\n\nAnd a federal judge ruled last week that the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is valid even without a formal vote to open it, blowing up one of Trump and the GOP\u2019s chief arguments.\n\nRepublicans, however, still think they are on solid ground when it comes to their process argument and aren\u2019t ready to drop that crusade entirely. Just last week, dozens of Republicans stormed the secure facility in the Capitol where the closed-door depositions are held. And the GOP painted Pelosi\u2019s surprise announcement about the impeachment resolution as an admission that the probe has been invalid all along.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fix this process at this point, where they\u2019ve done so much in secret,\u201d said Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the GOP Conference chairwoman. \u201cBut the fact that they now feel like they\u2019ve got to move and do something in public shows you it\u2019s an admission of guilt.\u201d\n\nBut there is a growing feeling among some in the party that they can\u2019t rely on process arguments alone. Republicans want to get out ahead of whatever allegations might be coming down the pike when Democrats take their impeachment inquiry public.\n\n\u201cI believe that both are important to talk about,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cThe process goes to the legitimacy, the credibility, the fairness of what House Democrats are pursuing. The substance is incredibly important as well.\u201d\n\nMeadows fired off a tweet on Monday morning that laid out his case for why he thinks Trump is innocent in the Ukraine scandal, likely offering a preview of the more substantive argument that he and his allies will be making in the coming days and weeks.\n\n\u201cWhile Democrats continue to leak false narratives,\u201d he wrote, \u201chere\u2019s what the actual witness interviews would show you: No aid was ever traded for any political investigations. Ukraine aid continued to flow WITHOUT new investigations. There is zero basis for impeachment.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas), a former prosecutor. But some of the other Republican members on the committee, like Reps. Mike Turner of Ohio and Will Hurd of Texas, may be less reliably staunch defenders: Both have expressed concern over Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine.", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "President Donald Trump."], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d2/fb/8a95ec3147c5827bd2266499887d/191028-gop-impeachment-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
