Poland eventually finished fifth.\n\nFelix, 33, has also won three world titles in the women\u2019s 200 meters, one in the 400 meters, three in the women\u2019s 4x100 meters relay and four in the women\u2019s 4x400 meters relay.", "description": "Allyson Felix won her 12th world title, and her first since becoming a mother, as the United States claimed the inaugural world championship 4x400 meters mixed relay on Sunday.", "authors": ["Brian Homewood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435299364&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0SU-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
