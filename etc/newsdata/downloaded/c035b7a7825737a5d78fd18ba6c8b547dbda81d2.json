Stop.\u201d\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlanis attempted to deal with the depression on her own before she finally went to a medical professional.\n\n\u2018My survival strategy is to just push through, and then I spoke with a professional who knew all about postpartum depression,\u2019 she said.\n\nAlanis has dealth with PPD for around 10 years (Picture: Gary Miller/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018And I asked her, \u201cDoes this go away if I just white knuckle through it?\u201d she said, \u201cNo, it actually gets worse.\u201d\n\n\u2018So as soon as I heard that, I thought \u201cit can\u2019t get worse than this\u201d so then I went on medication right away.\u2019\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning singer penned an essay on her website earlier this month explaining why going through this is all okay.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nA part of her essay said: \u2018I have been here before. I know there is another side. And the other side is greater than my PPD-riddled-temporarily-adjusted-brain could have ever imagined: as a mom, as an artist, as a wife, as a friend, as a collaborator, as a leader, as a boss, as an activist [sic].\n\n\u2018\u2026There is so much more support this time. I knew better so I set it up to win as much as I could beforehand. Support. Food. Friends. Sun. Bio-identical hormones and SSRI\u2019s at the ready.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then concluded the essay promising to share more, saying: \u2018I am here. With you.
