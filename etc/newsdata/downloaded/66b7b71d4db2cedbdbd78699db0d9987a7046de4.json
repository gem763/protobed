We all know it. It\u2019s beyond a disgrace. He\u2019s a low-life. He\u2019s going to ruin this country,\u201d De Niro told the outlet.\n\nROBERT DE NIRO SUED FOR GENDER DISCRIMINATION BY FORMER EMPLOYEE\n\nHe continued: \u201cHe\u2019s beyond a horrible person. I went on television the day after he was elected and I said, \u2018I\u2019m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.\u2019 But he\u2019s worse than we ever thought he would be.\u201d\n\nThe 76-year-old went on to lambast fans of Trump\u2019s successful reality series \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d for selling people on his qualifications to run the country.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an idiot. He\u2019s a fool. He\u2019s a buffoon. He\u2019s silly. He\u2019s tacky. He\u2019s dangerous. That stupid show 'The Apprentice,' people bought it. They buy into it\u2026 They created a monster.\u201d\n\nThe interview took place on the same day that 22 people were killed in an El Paso, Texas Walmart by a shooter who said he specifically targeted Mexcian people. When asked about the massacre, De Niro was quick to blame the president\u2019s rhetoric as well.\n\nANTONIO SABATO SLAMS ROBERT DE NIRO: HE CALLS TRUMP A 'GANGSTER,' BUT HE'S ACTING LIKE ONE\n\n\u201cYeah, I think he does. And everyone is realizing that now, more and more,\u201d he said when asked if Trump has blood on his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s so preposterous that the NRA has a grip on the Republicans. It\u2019s all about money. They\u2019re beyond shame. Those [gunmen] are crazy people, but they\u2019re inspired by Trump and what he\u2019s allowed. It\u2019s all subtle but it\u2019s all there. He\u2019s allowed it. He starts it. He encourages it.\u201d\n\nDe Niro is rarely shy about calling out Trump during public appearances and interviews. In June 2018, he actually got the president\u2019s attention. Trump dressed the \u201cRaging Bull\u201d actor down in a pair of tweets calling him a \u201clow IQ individual.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cRobert De Niro, a very Low IQ individual, has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies,\u201d the tweets read. \u201cI watched him last night and truly believe he may be \u2018punch-drunk.\u2019 I guess he doesn\u2019t realize the economy is the best it\u2019s ever been with employment being at an all time high, and many companies pouring back into our country.
