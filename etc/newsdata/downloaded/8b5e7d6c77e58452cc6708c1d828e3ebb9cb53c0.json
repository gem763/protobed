Mahathir mobilized a movement by allying with the unlikeliest of partners: Anwar Ibrahim, a man his government had convicted 20 years earlier on a charge of sodomy. (It\u2019s illegal in Malaysia\u2014a relic of British colonialism.) Anwar had once been the prime minister\u2019s handpicked political heir, but the pair fell out in 1998. The next year, Anwar began a five-year prison sentence. He eventually reassumed leadership of the opposition, but in 2015 he found himself again imprisoned on sodomy charges. Anwar\u2014by the time of his release, already 70 himself\u2014then joined his old tormenter to bring down the far-more-scandal-ravaged Najib.\n\nDr. M.\u2019s advanced age was supposed to guarantee Anwar\u2019s speedy succession; after all, how long could a nonagenarian be expected to last? But Mahathir shows few signs of leaving the stage, and his closest aides are reportedly trying hard to kick Anwar to the curb. The effort took a hit, however, when a putative replacement heir was himself accused of sodomy\u2014with a videotape to back up the charges.\n\nWhen asked why they support Mahathir so strongly, many Malaysians I asked responded with a question of their own: Who else is there?\n\nLesson Four: It\u2019s the issues, stupid\n\nTo the extent that Mahathir\u2019s age is a factor in people\u2019s minds, it may even play to his advantage. \u201cPerhaps it has to do with Asian culture,\u201d James Chin, a Malaysia scholar at the University of Tasmania, told me. \u201cAge and experience are deeply respected.\u201d This difference between Asian and Western values\u2014whether or not such a broad generalization is indeed valid\u2014is precisely the contrast that the prime minister has championed throughout his career. And the issues confronting Malaysia certainly deserve a steady hand at the wheel: recovery of public trust after 1MDB, questions on how to deal with a rising China, and\u2014perhaps most important\u2014the long-term challenges of a multiethnic, multi-religious society.\n\nDuring his earlier stint in office, Dr. M. released \u201cVision 2020\u201d\u2014a plan to transform Malaysia from a society in which the bumiputra (ethnic Malays) were granted special privileges, but other communities (such as ethnic Chinese and Indians) enjoyed a disproportionate share of the economic and educational benefits. The plan made sense: Offer a big, bold agenda\u2014and place its implementation safely three decades in the future. When he unrolled Vision 2020 back in 1991, he assumed that the thorny question of how to implement it would fall into somebody else\u2019s lap. Perhaps the greatest challenge for Mahathir 2.0 is how to fulfill the promises made by Mahathir 1.0.\n\nMalaysians are divided about the economy, the rise of China, Vision 2020, and everything else. These questions seem more important than how many years their prime minister has been on the planet. \u201cHis challenge isn\u2019t that he\u2019s old,\u201d said Lemiere, who watched voters interact with him over the course of half a year. \u201cIt\u2019s that he\u2019s old-fashioned.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S. presidential election, the incumbent and his three top challengers are, combined, half a century older than the nation itself. Will that matter? Should it? Malaysian citizens have plenty of legitimate reasons, quite apart from age, to either adore or detest Mahathir. Will the American people be willing to support a, um, mature candidate? One way or another, they probably will. Maybe give them credit for having a bit of maturity themselves.", "description": "The country\u2019s 94-year-old prime minister offers lessons for the array of 70-somethings running for the presidency.", "authors": ["Jonah Blank"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS1QOR0/facebook.jpg?1568290505"}
