But he\u2019s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.\u2019\u201d\n\nLet that sink in for a moment. On a debate stage on a major broadcast network, the sitting president of the United States was point-blank accused of responsibility for the vicious slaughter of 22 innocents.\n\nYet that wasn\u2019t even the most slanderous charge leveled against the chief executive, not by a long shot. The \u201cwinner\u201d in that category also emanated from the addled brain of the White House wannabe initially referenced above:\n\n\u201cBut we will also call out the fact that we have a white supremacist in the White House, and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country.\u201d\n\nIn other words, our president, per Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke and Webster\u2019s dictionary, is \u201ca person who believes that the white race is inherently superior to other races and that white people should have control over people of other races.\u201d And endangers their existence.\n\nNow, debates over the last two cycles have occasioned some fairly gnarly incidents \u2014 including a previous all-time low when candidate Donald Trump himself assured America of the ampleness of his manhood.\n\nBut these latest calumnies are so far out of the realm of acceptable political discourse that they represent a new level of debasement of the electoral process.\n\nThere was a time when some adult on the stage would have protested \u2014 in the manner of the time-outs called last night when internecine attacks got a little too heated \u2014 that these animadversions had crossed a line. Instead, the progenitor of those defamations earned shout-outs by no fewer than five of his fellows for his shameless politicization of the unthinkable tragedy in El Paso, on top of similar blood libels of the president.\n\nYet as shameless as the candidates\u2019 collective deportment, the real blame must be laid at the feet of the completely immoderate moderators at the half-cattle calls, half oratorical free-for-alls now passing for debates.\n\nSpeaking of harking back to an earlier era: Can one imagine such men as Cronkite, Huntley, Brinkley, Reynolds or Reasoner \u2014 for all their liberal leanings \u2014 simply moving on to the next contrived question following an assertion that the head of the state of the Land of the Free was a racist?\n\nCertainly, a real journalist would have stopped the proceedings and said, \u201cMr. O\u2019Rourke, did I hear you correctly? Did you just suggest that the president believes that whites are superior to nonwhites and that nonwhites should be under subjugation?\u201d Just as a disbelieving Max Frankel called time and doubled back on President Gerald Ford\u2019s far less offensive brain fart in a 1976 debate that \u201cthere is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.\u201d\n\nToday, that role has been abandoned in favor of panelists\u2019 serving as activists spurring candidates to new heights of \u201ccan-you-top-this\u201d excess.\n\nThe premier examples at last night\u2019s affair were Linsey Davis and Jorge Ramos, who neatly fulfilled the stereotypic functions assigned them as moderators of color: to stir up further controversy and racial division.\n\nEvery single Davis question went to questions of race, including suggestions that Trump has worsened the racial divide, that the justice system is inherently racist, and that nonwhite schools remain deliberately segregated and therefore underfunded. Each Ramos query related to the inherent racism in the president\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nTheir questions evoked the intended rhetorical pyrotechnics, which went beyond the indictments of the commander in chief to up the ante on the Democrats\u2019 damnation of the entire country as thinly veiled Simon Legrees.\n\nO\u2019Rourke again: \u201cRacism in America is endemic. It is foundational.\u201d\n\nCorey Booker: \u201cSystemic racism \u2026 is eroding our nation from health care to the criminal justice system,\u201d not to mention \u201cenvironmental injustice in communities of color.\u201d\n\nPastor Pete Buttigieg one-upped the \u201csystemic racism\u201d charge in referring to \u201cthe generational theft of the descendants of slaves\u201d that \u201cputs us in two countries.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s arguable that Buttigieg boasted the second-lowest moment of the night with his own \u201cdeplorables\u201d misstep by jumping feet-first into Ramos\u2019 leading interrogative:\n\nRamos: \u201cDo you think that people who support President Trump and his immigration policies are racist?\u201d\n\nButtigieg: \u201cAnyone who supports this is supporting racism.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton \u2014 call your office.\n\nBetter yet: Where is Joseph Nye Welch when we need him? Have these Democrats, at long last, have left no sense of decorum? And is there no moderator left who truly believes in moderating to call them to account?\n\nShare this...\n\n\n\n\n\nReddit\n\nLinkedin\n\nemail", "description": "As shameless as the candidates\u2019 collective deportment, the real blame must be laid at the feet of the completely immoderate moderators.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/issuesinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/debate-e1568366534242.jpg?fit=1185%2C570&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
