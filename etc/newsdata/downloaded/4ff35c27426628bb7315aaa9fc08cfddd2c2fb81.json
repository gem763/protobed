Prosecutors say she orchestrated his killing when she fell in love with another man and feared she could lose custody of her children.\n\nGreen's body was found on a dirt road in Sonoma County, California two weeks after he was last seen with Li, according to the Associated Press.

By the 1990s, the property development company had scored property in the high-rent business district around the China World Hotel.\n\nThe family came to the San Francisco Bay area and continued their real estate adventures on this side of the Pacific.
