Photo: PAUL ELLIS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMPs are urging the UK government to lay out how prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal could affect the economy ahead of their crunch vote in parliament on Saturday.\n\nPoliticians have been left with just two days to decide whether to back the new divorce agreement, after UK and EU negotiators announced their breakthrough and published the details on Thursday.\n\nThe UK government needs to win over wavering MPs from across parties as it lacks a majority in parliament, but now faces growing pressure to make clear how it could affect British jobs and firms in years to come.\n\nThe previous administration under former prime minister Theresa May had published a detailed economic analysis, which predicted various Brexit scenarios including May\u2019s deal could significantly dent economic growth.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018We\u2019ve been here before\u2019: businesses gives Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal a cautious welcome\n\nNow the head of an influential cross-party group of MPs on parliament\u2019s Treasury committee has written to chancellor Sajid Javid, urging the government to clarify how it believes its revised agreement will affect GDP.\n\nCatherine McKinnell, interim chair of the committee and a Labour MP, said: \u201cThe Treasury committee asked HM Treasury whether the government has updated its economic analysis of Brexit three months ago, yet we are still awaiting a response.\n\n\u201cWhen MPs vote on the government\u2019s new deal on Saturday, we should do so with as much information as possible. I have asked the chancellor, therefore, to respond prior to the meaningful vote.\u201d\n\nSeveral think tanks and business groups have already warned the deal could increase the cost and difficulties of trading with Europe, with less commitment to frictionless trade than under May\u2019s deal or current arrangements.\n\nMarley Morris, trade director at the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank, said: \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s new deal with the EU paves the way for a rupture with the EU. The new political declaration reveals he is heading towards a more distant UK-EU relationship than Theresa May proposed, involving more trade barriers and less cooperation.\n\n\u201cAnd the withdrawal agreement removes the arrangements for a UK-EU customs union, thereby eliminating a key barrier in his ambitions for a hard Brexit.\u201d\n\nThe IPPR notes Johnson\u2019s deal has removed references to alignment with EU rules, and acknowledges firms will face fresh bureaucracy trading with Europe through new \u2018rules of origin\u2019 checks on where goods have come from.\n\nIt has also downgraded a commitment to maintain environmental, social and employment standards at current levels from the legally binding withdrawal agreement to the non-legally binding political declaration.\n\nThe Treasury has been approached for comment.", "description": "Fears are growing the new Brexit deal could damage frictionless trade with Europe as parliament prepares to vote on Saturday.", "authors": ["Tom Belger", "Finance", "Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FP.bYgrTj0g1Bdbf_zgy3Q--~B/aD0yODI0O3c9NDYzMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/ae8b2610-f185-11e9-b5bf-50c38084c9bf", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
