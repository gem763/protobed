I didn't expect it to happen\", he said.\n\n\"When it happened I was devastated. I thought it was going to be Dean and I calmed down when Lord Sugar said he had lost us profit. But then he flipped back to me and I knew.\n\n\"When they said they sold nothing, I knew I was a dead man walking.\"\n\n(Image: twitter)\n\nDean's review continues: \"Proper place, pukka pies looked as if they'd seen better days but I had some fond memories here despite everything.\n\n\"Last few visits weren't my own choice but I'd definitely be back at my own leisure.\n\n\"Top notch tea and staff always welcomed me and my guess no matter the mood we were in.\"\n\nHe concluded: \"Less blue sky thinking, more tea drinking if you know what I mean.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMeanwhile, Kenna is now reportedly considering going on Love Island in his bid to become a reality TV star.\n\nSpeaking to Mirror TV, he said that the experience certainly hadn't put him off appearing in more reality TV shows and is keen to stay on telly.\n\nHe said: \"Definitely, because it's a way to keep my business in the public eye to do more TV work.\"\n\nAsked whether he'd be interested in doing Love Island, he replied: \"Yeah that's on my to do list! Not to find love, obviously.\"\n\nSpeaking about his future plans, Kenna said: \"For me, it's to launch my vegan apple and cheese ice cream product my Christmas time. But yeah, definitely like I said, to stay in the public eye and to do more TV work.\"\n\n*The Apprentice returns next Wednesday at 9pm on BBC One", "description": "The Apprentice star Dean praised the cafe's pricing and quarter pounder burgers", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Pa", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20554997.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_The-Apprentice-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
