But there were significant charges during the quarter related to a massive restructuring effort at GE.\n\nRemoving one-time costs, per share earnings were 15 cents, 3 cents better than Wall Street had expected, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.\n\nThe losses this third quarter were less than half of last year's $22.8 billion.\n\nGE took a $8.7 billion charge related to its diminishing involvement with the oilfield services company Baker Hughes, and almost $2 billion in charges related to financial and power businesses.\n\n\"We have more work to do, and we will continue to take actions to improve our financial position and strengthen our businesses as we prepare for 2020 and beyond,\" Culp said in a prepared statement. \"I remain confident that we will unlock value for GE's stakeholders as our transformation accelerates.\"\n\nCulp became CEO last October after John Flannery was forced out.\n\nSince then, shares of General Electric Co. are up 27%. Shares jumped 7% before the opening bell Wednesday.\n\nGE said it is making progress in cleaning up its troubled power division and its focus on its industrial core is bearing fruit.\n\nWhile overall revenue was flat at $23.36 billion, industrial segment organic revenues rose 7%.\n\nIn July the company anticipated its full-year industrial free cash flow would be negative $1 billion to positive $1 billion. On Wednesday it painted a rosier picture, saying it now expects industrial free cash flow would be flat to $2 billion.\n\nThe company expects that cash flow to remain in positive territory next year, and that it will accelerate in 2021.\n\nRevenue for the aviation segment rose 8%, with GE saying it continues to work closely with Boeing to ensure the timely and safe return to service of the 737 Max.\n\nGE helps make engines for Boeing's 737 Max planes and took a hit after the plane was grounded following two deadly crashes.\n\nTotal orders increased 5%, while backlog grew 14%.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nPortions of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.
