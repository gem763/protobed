The deal was negotiated by Executive Editor Shannon Welch at HarperOne and Judith Curr, President and Publisher, HarperOne Group. The book will be published across all HarperCollins locations worldwide.\n\nBACK is a candid and intimate narrative of an outsize American life: from growing up a celebrated golfing prodigy to shattering centuries-old racial barriers as a young pro; from rising to unprecedented fame and global icon status to battling devastating injuries and personal issues; from enduring years of physical anguish to mounting an astonishing comeback at 43 years old, culminating with the 2019 Masters, where his thrillingly impossible victory captured the imagination and hearts of people around the world.\n\nThis memoir is the first and only account directly from Woods, with the full cooperation of his friends, family, and inner circle.\n\nWoods said, \u201cI\u2019ve been in the spotlight for a long time, and because of that, there have been books and articles and TV shows about me, most filled with errors, speculative and wrong. This book is my definitive story. It\u2019s in my words and expresses my thoughts. It describes how I feel and what\u2019s happened in my life. I\u2019ve been working at it steadily, and I\u2019m looking forward to continuing the process and creating a book that people will want to read.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled and proud to work with Tiger on what I believe will be the publishing event of the decade,\u201d said Curr. \u201cTiger will reclaim his own story and legacy and it\u2019s a story for the world over.\u201d\n\nWelch, who will edit the book, said, \u201cMeeting with Tiger, speaking with him at length about the process of writing a memoir, I was delighted to discover how much he has to say, and how ready, how eager, he is to say it. He\u2019s at a place in his career and his life where he\u2019s thinking deeply about his story, the highs and the lows, and how it all relates and connects. I think the result will be extraordinary.\u201d\n\nAbout Tiger Woods:\n\nWoods serves as Founder and CEO of TGR, Tiger Woods Ventures, a multibrand enterprise comprising his various companies and philanthropic endeavors, including TGR Foundation, a charitable foundation serving underrepresented youth through education; TGR Design, the golf course design company; TGR Live, an events company; and The Woods Jupiter, an upscale sports restaurant.\n\nHe has 81 PGA TOUR wins, the second-highest total of any player.
