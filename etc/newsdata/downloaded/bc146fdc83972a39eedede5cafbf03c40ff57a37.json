The question is, do you know what they look like and how they differ?\n\nTake our quiz to test your speed camera facts - and read on below if you want to find out more about all the different types and how they can catch you.\n\nIf you're unable to see the quiz in the MailOnline app or in Facebook Instant Articles please click on the following link to view it.\n\n1. Digital Gatso speed cameras\n\nThe Gatso is the original speed camera - the first type of camera enforcement introduced to Britain's roadsides some 27 years ago to flash over-the-limit motorists.\n\nIt was one of the most commonly-used speed cameras on UK roads in the early phase of Big Brother speed enforcement, though it's slowly being replaced by newer technology.\n\nThe square yellow boxes - which were grey from 1992 until 2001 when law stipulated that all speed cameras needed to be easy to see - have cameras using film that are now considered old hat.\n\nThe manufacturer has a new system called Digital Gatsos, which have been available since 2007 and becoming more widespread.\n\nThe benefit to motorists is that they're easier to spot because they are much larger.\n\nBut there's a big advantage for operators and police forces too, because the use of digital images instead of film means they no longer need to constantly check they are still working correctly and always active to enforce offences.\n\nThe traditional Gatso (left) is the one most drivers will be more accustom with. However, it is now widely replaced by a Digital Gatso (right) that doesn't use film\n\nNo matter which type of Gatso it is, they are all rear-facing only (so they don't dazzle drivers when the flash goes off and also so they can catch motorcyclists breaking the law) and use radar technology to trigger the camera to take two photos in quick succession - which is why drivers often see a double flash.\n\nThe flash not only illuminates the car and its registration plate but also the white calibration lines painted onto the road surface.\n\nWhile the speed is measured by the camera, these white lines are a secondary measure to prove if a driver was over the limit by judging the distance covered over time.\n\n2. Truvelo Combi speed cameras\n\nThe Truvelo camera uses infra-red technology, so you won't see it flash\n\nThe problem - for enforcement - with Gatso speed cameras is that, being rear facing, they fail to capture the face of the motorist at the wheel.\n\nThis has allowed fine-dodging individuals to claim they weren't the driver of the car at the time it was snapped.\n\nHowever, the forward-facing Truvelo camera eliminates that issue and is now becoming more common on British roads.\n\nUnlike Gatsos, it doesn't flash. Instead, it uses infra-red technology, so the forward-facing installations won't momentarily blind any motorists with a bright light.\n\nUsing four sensors that are hidden in the road surface, it can calculate at what speed a vehicle is travelling when it passes the camera.\n\nSimilar to Gatsos, they are positioned where there are three white lines on the road to measure the time it takes a car to cover a particular distance. This is then used as back-up proof of speeding if a motorist disputes the camera reading.\n\nThe Truvelo D-Cam is also a forward- and rear-facing camera that can identify the speeding motorist at the wheel\n\n3. Truvelo D-Cam speed cameras\n\nTruvelo's latest offering arrived in 2013.\n\nCalled the D-Cam - short for Digital Camera - it uses the same technology but can be installed both forward- and rear-facing, making them the ideal replacement not just for the older Truvelo systems but Gatsos too.\n\nYou'll most commonly spot these futuristic-looking cameras fixed in the central reservation of the road - though the example pictured is at the side - and they can monitor across up to three lanes of traffic at a time.\n\nDigital photos taken by these cameras are sent in real-time to databases run by police forces and operators.\n\nSmart motorways call for smart speed cameras, and the HADECS3 is the latest version being used to snap drivers during variable restrictions\n\n4. HADECS3 speed camera\n\nMotorway speed cameras have been through the biggest transformation in the last decade - and the arrival of Smart Motorways has made them even smarter - and more sneaky.\n\nAre Smart Motorway speed cameras operating at all times? Can you be caught speeding by cameras on smart motorways when there are no variable limits in place? Find out here.\n\nThe latest example is the third system from HADECS, which stands for Highway Agency Digital Enforcement Camera System.\n\nThis camera type being used predominantly on smart motorways, including sections of the M25, M1 and M6.\n\nThey can be notoriously difficult to spot as they are placed high on gantries above the road and - reportedly - not all of them are painted yellow.\n\nThey're among the most advanced systems in use, using radar technology unlike anything we've seen in speed-camera technology yet.\n\nThey can monitor up to five lanes of traffic (including the hard shoulder, which may be active as a running lane) and can capture vehicles using lane identification, vehicle position and positive vehicle identification.\n\nThey also operate faultlessly to catch speeders in all weather conditions.\n\nThe SPECS camera is the first of the average speed monitors that were given UK approval in 1999\n\n5. SPECS average speed camera\n\nThe turn of the century brought a new menace to motorists with the introduction of the average speed camera, with the Home Office giving them approval in 1999.\n\nSPECS are the earliest examples of average speed restriction enforcers, using a combination of video and Automatic Number Plate Reading (ANPR) technology to track motorists between at least two cameras on motorways and dual carriageways.\n\nEach camera - fitted on overhead gantries - has an infra-red system to monitor vehicles and appear in a sequence on a motorway at least 200 metres apart.\n\nThis way they can calculate your average speed over a set distance, which can be anything between 75 metres and 20 kilometres.\n\nThe ANPR technology is used to identify the vehicle and owner and is used to issue a ticket.\n\nVECTOR average speed cameras are later versions of SPECS that can be used to capture more than just speeding offences\n\n6. VECTOR average speed cameras\n\nVECTOR average speed cameras came just five years after SPECS and do almost exactly the same job.\n\nHowever, the manufacturer has managed to retrofit the technology for additional use as well as speed detection.\n\nIn fact, only those painted yellow can catch you over the limit.\n\nGrey VECTOR cameras can be seen dotted around city centres, especially London.\n\nThese are ANPR cameras for the enforcement of bus lanes, traffic lights, yellow-box junctions and the capital's Congestion Zone. They're also used at tolls and for parking management.\n\nDespite being bright yellow, the Siemens SafeZone cameras are so ultra-compact they're incredibly difficult to spot on the road\n\nMost of the Siemens cameras are being used in slower restrictions, such as outside schools\n\n7. Siemens SafeZone average speed camera\n\nDespite being bright yellow these Siemens cameras incredibly compact and discreet, making them one of the hardest speed cameras to spot on the road to date.\n\nThis average speed camera is most commonly used in towns, cities and villages in the UK, particularly zones where low-speed management is critical, such as outside schools.\n\nThey're another example of ANPR technology being put to use to enforce speed limits but also to assist to reduce traffic congestion.\n\nThe SafeZone camera is approved for constant monitoring of speed limits between 20mph and 140mph, so can also be used in a variety of locations, from urban areas to Europe's fastest-moving motorways.\n\nWhat makes them even more difficult to identify is the fact they can be fitted to existing street furniture, such as cantilever poles and bridges, and double installations can film in one or both directions at the same time.\n\nSpeedSpike is one of the latest forms of ANPR speed camera. Up to 1,000 can be hooked up to work together to capture average speeds across an area\n\n8. SpeedSpike average speed cameras\n\nAnother newcomer to the market is the SpeedSpike, which has some fairly incredible - and frightening for motorists - claims.\n\nFor instance, the manufacturer of this average speed camera says a network of up to 1,000 separate cameras can be linked together using GPRS to provide enforcement of an area 24 hours a day.\n\nLike SPECS, VECTOR and the Siemens camera, it uses ANPR, so can identify your vehicle rapidly when cross-referenced with an online database.\n\nMost are being trialled on gantries and roadside posts where there are roadworks on one side of the carriageway and different limits need to be enforced in each direction.\n\nThe cameras, which are positioned together but facing away from each other, can sit in the central reservation and detect speeding motorists going in both directions in different restrictions.\n\nPeek speed cameras, like this one, are considered old hat and have mostly been replaced across the country\n\n9. Peek speed cameras\n\nPeek cameras are few and far between today with just a few still in operation in built-up areas in the UK.\n\nSimilar to Gatsos, they're solely rear-facing systems, have a flash and rely entirely on radar technology.\n\nSpeedCurb cameras are used to catch drivers running red lights, but also those speeding\n\n10. SpeedCurb speed cameras\n\nYou might have to look fairly high to spot one of these cameras in the wild, as they have been categorised as one of the tallest-mounted units currently being deployed in the UK.\n\nThey have a dual-purpose, being used to monitor traffic light offences too, though most will be tracking your speed.\n\nIn most situations they are installed on their own, though some are being dual mounted in the centre of dual carriageways and motorways to monitor up to a total of four lanes of traffic, two in each direction of travel.\n\nLike Gatsos, they're only rear-facing.\n\nHowever, they use radar to capture speeding motorists, with sensors in the tarmac triggering them to fire - similar to the Truvelo systems.\n\nIf you're unfortunate enough to be snapped by one, it will take three digital photos as proof of your law breaking.\n\nThe first two are wide-angle photos to show the vehicle in full, while a third is a zoomed-in shot on the vehicle's number plate.\n\nTraffic light cameras have recently been retrofitted for use as speed cameras, working in a similar way to Gatso cameras\n\n11. Traffic light cameras\n\nDon't be under the assumption that an obvious camera situated at a set of traffic lights can't catch you speeding.\n\nThese cameras tend to be triggered by radar technology or ground loops in the road at junctions to take pictures of those jumping red lights.\n\nHowever, they can also be used in combination with speed measurement in a similar way as a Gatso speed camera operates.\n\nREDFLEX cameras can capture both multiple offences by one vehicle at the same time and multiple offending vehicles speeding through the same junction\n\n12. REDFLEX Speed Cameras\n\nREDFLEX is another new camera that many Britons might not have seen yet, but having been approved by the Home Office recently are likely to crop up more often.\n\nThere are two types - REDFLEXred for traffic light enforcement and speeding through green lights and REDFLEXspeed - a motorway speed enforcement system covering up to six lanes.\n\nREDFLEX says the cameras can also be used to enforce average speed zones, though these can only measure average speed from one camera to another.\n\nEach camera has a built-in 11 megapixel digital camera that produce high-resolution colour images.\n\nImpressively, they can not just capture multiple offences by a driver in a single vehicle but identify multiple offending vehicles at the same junction.\n\n13. Mobile speed cameras\n\nMobile speed camera vans are still being used in the UK at multiple sites.\n\nHidden inside the vehicle is an operator with one of a number of different cameras.\n\nThis includes mini Gatsos, radar guns and laser guns.\n\nThere are two types of mobile speed camera - ones that rely on technology in the road (DS2) and ones that can be used anywhere\n\n14. DS2 mobile speed cameras\n\nIt's a little unfair to call these mobile speed cameras because they're actually semi-permanent.\n\nThat's because they're only used at sites where there are three piezo strips either on top of the road surface or embedded within the tarmac.\n\nWhen in use, the camera partnership vans used for the operation are connected to the DS2 sites that automatically trigger the cameras. The lines on the road can then be used as additional evidence of speeding.\n\nOne benefit for operators is that DS2 systems can be left unattended with some of the cameras used by forces, meaning the vehicles can be unmanned and still capture speeders.\n\nThe long-ranger camera can snap drivers speeding from a mile away. It can also be used to enforce dangerous driving, seatbelt and mobile phone offences\n\n15. Long Ranger mobile speed camera\n\nGloucestershire Police has been using this new long-range camera at 35 sites on the A417 since November 2018.\n\nIt can capture speeding drivers from one kilometre away, making it the longest distance speed enforcer currently in use.\n\nAnd it's not just speed that it can detect.\n\nIt's also used for catching tailgaters, middle-lane hoggers, drivers not wearing seatbelts and anyone using a phone behind the wheel.", "description": "Do you know your Gatso from your HADECS?
