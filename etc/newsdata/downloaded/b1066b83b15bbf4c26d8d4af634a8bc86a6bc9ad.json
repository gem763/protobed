He is already a wanted criminal suspect in Taiwan with a warrant out for his arrest,' Tsai said during a visit to the Taiwanese-held island of Kinmen just off the Chinese coast.\n\n'Therefore, regarding this case, there is no issue of free travel or just being a backpacker. There is only the matter of arrest and no question of simply turning oneself in,' Tsai said.\n\nChan Tong-kai, center, talks to the media as he is released from prison in Hong Kong Wednesday\n\nTaiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said allowing a murder suspect to fly on his own would ignore the safety of other passengers and that Hong Kong's approach would indulge Chan and make Hong Kong 'a criminal paradise where murderers can walk around.'\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam had repeatedly cited Chan's case as justifying the proposed amendments to the extradition legislation, saying he could not be sent to the self-ruled island because there was no extradition agreement in place.\n\nBut the proposal stoked widespread fears residents of Hong Kong, which has maintained its own independent courts since reverting from British to Chinese rule in 1997, would be put at risk of being sent into mainland China's Communist Party-controlled judicial system.\n\nChan Tong-kai, left, bows after talking to the media as he is released from prison in Hong Kong Wednesday\n\nLam was forced to announce last month that she would drop the bill in the face of fierce opposition.\n\nThe protests erupted in early June and snowballed into the city's biggest political crisis in decades, expanding to demands for universal suffrage and an investigation into allegations of police abuses, most recently including the spraying of a mosque and bystanders with high-pressure blue-dyed water from an urban assault vehicle.\n\nAmid the ongoing political chaos and street violence, Lam's future as Beijing's pick to lead Hong Kong has been repeatedly questioned.\n\nThe newspaper Financial Times reported Beijing may be planning to replace Lam with an interim chief executive as early as March, but is holding off so as not to appear to be caving into the opposition's demands.", "description": "Months of pro-democracy demonstrations in the financial hub were sparked by protests against the now-cancelled extradition law - which would have allowed suspects to be extradited to China.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/10/20073428-0-image-a-12_1571821370921.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
