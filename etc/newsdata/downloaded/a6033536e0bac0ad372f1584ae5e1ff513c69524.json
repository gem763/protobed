For much of the 20th century, smoking was not just an indulgence some people enjoyed every now and then, but the default vice of pretty much every adult. That\u2019s why cars ended up with cigarette lighters and ashtrays crammed in every door, and why bonkers accessories like the Ronson Robot-Litre exist.\n\nThe Ronson Robot-Litre was the perfect accessory for smoker-drivers who were fed up, just absolutely sick of the tedious, inefficient joke of a process required for someone to enjoy a comfortable smoke in the car.\n\nSure, cars came with in-dash cigarette lighters and ashtrays, but you still had to manually fish a cigarette out of your pack, place it in your quivering, waiting mouth, push in the cigarette lighter, wait the interminable molasses-glazed seconds until it popped out, glowing spiral ready to ignite your smoke, then apply it to the cigarette to get it going then returning the lighter to its socket.\n\nWhew. Holy shit, that\u2019s exhausting. That\u2019s like five whole steps, and who the hell has time for that? That\u2019s time you could be smoking, or, at least, paying a little more attention to driving.\n\nThankfully, the Ronson company, which had been making matches and lighters for cigarettes since the 1890s (also patriotic and maybe a touch Jingoistic hood ornaments for cars) came up with a solution to the problem of simplifying driving and smoking in the 1960s: the Robot Litre.\n\nThe Robot Lighter reduced the complex, involved process of lighting up in a car to an incredibly streamlined two-step process: push a \u201ccontrol bar,\u201d take a lit cigarette.\n\nYes, this thing wasn\u2019t just some cheap-arse cigarette dispenser: this under-dash smoking assist system placed, directly into your nicotine-stained, shaking fingers a pre-lit cigarette, ready to be lodged in your mouth and experienced.\n\nThe Robot Litre plugged into the existing cigarette lighter outlet, and the hopper can hold 20 cigarettes\u2014why that\u2019s good for at least an hour, right?\n\nHere\u2019s a video of one\u2014sadly, it\u2019s not plugged into anything, and has no smokes in the hopper:\n\nIt appears the Robo-Litre could be mounted under the dash, or on the centre console. I\u2019m not certain how many of these they sold, but I imagine for the truly committed car-smoker this must have been some pro-level shit, you car just ejecting a lit cigarette right into your hand.\n\nThe only way this could possibly be better is if it could somehow be mounted on the visor to shoot a lit cigarette right into your waiting mouth, and maybe with a photocell to detect when the previous one was gone, so a new one can be fired off automatically.\n\nWhat would the modern equivalent of something like this be? An in-dash coffee maker that shoves a spring-loaded straw in your mouth, ready to inject coffee at preset temperatures and proper cream/sweetner/whatever mixed in?\n\nA sandwich injector that unwraps and stabilizes the sandwich? I don\u2019t really think anything analogous to this exists anymore, so let\u2019s just marvel at this artefact of a time and place now long gone.", "description": "It\u2019s easy to forget just how popular and widespread smoking once was.
