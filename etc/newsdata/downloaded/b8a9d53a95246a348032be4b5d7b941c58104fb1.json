REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Novartis AG laid the blame for the manipulation of data behind its $2.1 million gene therapy Zolgensma at the feet of the former executives Brian and Allan Kaspar, who it alleges either personally manipulated the data or pressured subordinates to manipulate the data.\n\nThe Kaspar brothers were executives at Avexis, the company that developed the drug and was acquired by Novartis for $8.7 billion last year.\n\nLast month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Novartis could face civil or criminal penalties because of the data manipulation and the possibility the company had waited to notify regulators.\n\nThe new allegations were in Novartis\u2019 response to the FDA\u2019s inspection report. They were written by the company in late August and released by the regulator on Tuesday.\n\nRepresentatives for the Kaspars could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nAfter its investigation Novartis fired Avexis\u2019 Chief Scientific Officer Brian Kaspar and Senior Vice President of Research and Development Allan Kaspar for cause on Aug. 13.\n\nThe company also said its internal investigation was drawn out because of the Kaspars\u2019 \u201clack of cooperation and categorical denial of the allegations.\u201d\n\nZolgensma - the world\u2019s most expensive drug - was approved as a one-time treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in late May.\n\nThe disease often leads to paralysis, breathing difficulty and death within months for babies born with the most serious Type I form. SMA affects about one in 10,000 live births, with 50% to 70% having Type I disease, and is the leading genetic cause of death in infants.", "description": "Novartis AG laid the blame for the manipulation of data behind its $2.1 million gene therapy Zolgensma at the feet of the former executives Brian and Allan Kaspar, who it alleges either personally manipulated the data or pressured subordinates to manipulate the data.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433391218&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1FD", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
