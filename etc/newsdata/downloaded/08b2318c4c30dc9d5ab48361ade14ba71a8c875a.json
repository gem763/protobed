The state Legislature established a program in 2015 that gives tax credits to Montana residents who provide supplemental funding to public schools or donate to scholarship funds to send children to private schools, including ones that are religiously affiliated.\n\nThe Department of Revenue determined the program violated the Montana Constitution by aiding religious schools and adopted a rule that excluded them. Three parents who filed suit challenging the rule won a decision in their favor but the state Supreme Court reversed the ruling, saying the program violates the Constitution\u2019s \u201cstringent prohibition on aid to sectarian schools.\u201d\n\nThe parents appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nWalter Weber, senior counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the parents, said the case is about school choice. The plaintiffs are seeking to affirm the principle that excluding eligible participants from a neutral government program simply because they are religious violates the Constitution, he said.\n\n\u201cSchool choice is a win-win,\u201d Weber wrote on the ACLJ website. \u201cParents select the program that best suits their educational plan for their children. Taxpayers save the money that public schools would otherwise have had to spend on the children.\u201d\n\nPatrick Elliot, senior counsel for the Freedom From Religion Foundation, called the court\u2019s decision to hear the case troubling and said using state aid for religion \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 is inherently coercive of taxpayers.\n\nHe also fears a decision upholding the program could have a \u201chorrendous impact\u201d on the rights of citizens under state constitutions.\n\n\u201cDepending on how broadly the justices decide the case, it could potentially undo one of the bedrock principles on which this nation was founded: Churches have no right to dip into the public purse,\u201d Elliot said.\n\nThe case has been accepted for review but arguments have not been scheduled.\n\nTransgender, gay rights\n\nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case of a transgender employee who was fired from a Detroit-area funeral home after informing the owner of plans to transition from male to female and begin dressing as a woman.\n\nFuneral home owner Thomas Rost said he dismissed Aimee Stephens (formerly known as Anthony Stephens) for violating the business dress code, which required men to wear a suit. He also argues that as a devout Christian who interprets the Bible as teaching that gender is immutable, he \u201cwould be violating God\u2019s commands\u201d if a man presented himself as a woman while representing the company.\n\nThe question before the justices in Harris Funeral Homes vs. EEOC is whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects people against discrimination based on their gender identity.\n\nThe court also will hear arguments that day in two cases \u2014 Bostock vs. Clayton County and Altitude Express vs. Zarda \u2014 about Title VII protections of men who allege they were fired from their jobs for being gay.\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing Rost, says the common original understanding of the term \u201csex\u201d means the objective biological categories of male and female. Title VII\u2019s ban on sex discrimination forbids businesses from treating employees of one sex better than employees of the other sex, ADF lawyers say.\n\n\u201cADF is also arguing that the decision of whether to amend Title VII to include \u2018sexual orientation\u2019 and \u2018gender identity\u2019 should be left to Congress, not unelected government bureaucrats or judges,\u201d Jordan Lorence, ADF senior counsel and director of strategic engagement, wrote on the organization\u2019s blog.\n\nDavid Cole, legal director of the ACLU, which represents Stephens, said on the At Liberty podcast that members of Congress obviously were not thinking in 1964 about how the Civil Rights Act might apply to LGBTQ people.\n\n\u201cBut the argument that we have made, and that a number of lower courts have accepted, is that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and discrimination on the basis of transgender status are essentially subsets of sex discrimination,\u201d Cole said.\n\nFree speech\n\nOther cases on the groups\u2019 watch lists have been appealed to the high court but the justices have not decided whether to accept them for review.\n\nOne is a First Amendment challenge to a policy prohibiting religious advertisements on buses, Archdiocese of Washington vs. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.\n\nIn another free speech case, Price vs. City of Chicago, the petitioners, who engage in \u201csidewalk counseling,\u201d are targeting a law that creates a \u201cbubble zone\u201d around abortion clinics. The ordinance prohibits people from coming within a 50-foot radius of the entrance of an abortion clinic or other medical facility or closer than eight feet to someone else \u201cfor the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to displaying a sign to or engaging in oral protest education or counseling with such other person.\u201d\n\nOther cases involve a florist who declined to make flower arrangements for a same-sex wedding; teachers who were fired or not rehired for failing to meet the standards at religious schools; a Seventh-day Adventist who says his employer failed to accommodate his Sabbath observance; and a student and her parents who allege a school district\u2019s lesson about Muslims violated the First Amendment\u2019s bar against government establishment of religion.", "description": "Oct. 7 (UPI) \u2014 The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to grapple with religious liberty cases ranging from transgender rights to religious ads on public", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
