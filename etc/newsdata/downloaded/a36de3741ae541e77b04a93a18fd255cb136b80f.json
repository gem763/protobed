Live like French royalty amid Medoc vineyards", "language": "en", "text": "Cordeillan-Bages looks magical lit up at dusk\n\nThere is something undeniably magical about a stay at a French chateau.\n\nIt is the stuff of Disney movies and dreams \u2013 and Chateau Cordellian-Bages fits the bill for both.\n\nA beautiful gold-stone turreted chartreuse (country mansion) set in a gorgeous wine-growing estate in the Haut-M\u00e9doc, a charming part of France a 40-minute drive from Bordeaux, it is exactly the sort of \u2018chateau chic\u2019 you hope for when you plan an escape to the chateau.\n\nAs the sweeping drive takes you to the entrance through acres of vineyards \u2013 the chateau owners produce some of the region\u2019s finest wine \u2013 you can\u2019t help but feel a little like visiting royalty.\n\nCh\u00e2teau Cordeillan-Bages is more than just the chateau itself \u2013 it is part of a remote, gold-stone hamlet restored by the Cazes family in 1989, nestled between two hectares of vineyards in the M\u00e9doc region just south of Pauillac on the left bank of the Gironde estuary.\n\nThe gold-stone chateau Cordeillan-Bages with its cute turrets and charming gardens\n\nThe chateau is famous for a wine beloved to those in the know \u2013 the fifth growth Grand Cru Classe, Chateau Lynch-Bages \u2013 and is one of the most famous vineyards in all of the M\u00e9doc region, but there\u2019s plenty more to do in this lovely part of France.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCycling the beautiful countryside, horseriding, bikes and hikes in the extensive 19th century forests, drives through medieval towns and villages and more than 150 miles of white sandy beaches on the nearby Atlantic coast.\n\nAway from the vineyards, surfing and watersports are a big deal and with such a long coastline accessible, beaches are uncrowded and peaceful.\n\nThere\u2019s also an annual wine marathon, the Marathon des Chateaux du M\u00e9doc, that takes place every September. This may be the only time the term fun-run really applies \u2013 you\u2019ll run 26.2 miles alongside people dressed as giant wine bottles with 20 wine stops en route that fuel runners with wine, steak, oysters and cheese as they pass through the vineyards of the M\u00e9doc.\n\nLe vibe\n\nRelaxed but elegant. We pulled up next to a line of Ferraris parked outside the hotel and felt slightly out of place in our little car \u2013 but we needn\u2019t have worried. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, no matter what wheels you arrive in.\n\nThe interior of the hotel combines French art de vivre with interiors designed by Milan-based architect, Anne-Monique Bonad\u00e9i, designer accents and walls adorned with contemporary works by Pierre Alechinsky, Emilio Perez, Tan Swie Hian, Antoni Tapies and G\u00e9rard Titus-Carmel.\n\nThe laid-back atmosphere extends to the grounds, where you can relax by the outdoor pool or sunbathe on the terrace overlooking the vineyards. This is the spot to grab a glass of Lynch-Bages as the sun sets ahead before heading in for a Michelin-star dinner in the hotel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLes rooms\n\nThe rooms are a neat blend of modern design cut with traditional chateau flourishes. There\u2019s a transparent glass wall that frosts over for privacy and nice big shower heads. From all of the 28 rooms you\u2019ll be treated to some sort of greenery for a view \u2014 be it the courtyard or the front garden filled with ornamental magnolia trees. Oak cupboards and Danish lighting finish off the peaceful, earthy design.\n\nThe rooms have a soothing blend of contemporary and traditional design with a little Danish design flair\n\nWhat to do\n\nWine is the natural choice \u2013 of course, you must tour the vineyards of the chateau and beyond. Elsewhere though, there\u2019s much more to do. Oyster tasting is a highlight in the M\u00e9doc region. You can simply rock up at La Petite Canau farm to discover how the region\u2019s refreshing oysters are cultivated once they\u2019re transported from Brittany while enjoying the wide skies that stretch across the farm.\n\nDuring the tour and tasting, there\u2019s the chance to learn about the logistics behind oyster farming. This particular farm is essentially a weight-gaining farm for the oysters, packing them with enough nutrients to make them plump and meaty.\n\nDifferent farms favour different flavours which can be achieved through the salt levels of the water they\u2019re soaked in, which is why the oysters of La Rochelle are particularly salty compared to those in the M\u00e9doc region. It\u2019s certainly an alternative date location\u2014sipping wine and eating oysters as the sun slowly sets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2010, the Cazes family renovated the village of Bages which is peaceful pit stop out of the hotel grounds.\n\nCycling through the vineyards and through the country paths is ideal for getting around and seeing the local area and some of the world\u2019s most famous vineyards \u2013 Chateau Latour, Mouton Rothschild and Lafite Rothchild are all just minutes away from the hotel.\n\nA short distance from the hotel, you\u2019ll reach the centre of Pauillac, with its wine library and the largest estuary in Europe, the Gironde, where you can gently cruise along the waters.\n\nFestivals and events happen all summer long here, including the festival of the cinema Les Vendanges du 7\u00e8me Art and winegrower presentations.\n\nIn August, the House of Tourism and Wine hosts a rendez-vous for lovers of music, gastronomy and wine in an idyllic setting on the estuary.\n\nThe food\n\nThe ch\u00e2teau, which has the only Michelin-starred restaurant in the Medoc, welcomed young Michelin-star chef Julien Lefebvre to lead the way in 2017, at the age of 35. His passion for sourcing natural produce draws in crowds of curious gastronomy lovers to try his contemporary French haute-cuisine.\n\nOne of the dishes at the Michelin-starred restaurant at Cordeillan-Bages\n\nDuring the early summer months, the Pauillac region is famous for its asparagus and strawberries with local producers harvesting their crops, so expect the freshest ingredients.\n\nWe tried the eight-course tasting menu which started with a decorative pre-amuse bouche on a winding bark-like ornament stippled in canap\u00e9s.\n\nNext came a modest batch of Laurent Hullot\u2019s asparagus with caramelised morels followed by line-caught meager, a succulent fish served with Noilly Prat sauce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tasting menu ended with two spectacular creamy desserts. The pastry chef, Antonin Billot, has somehow managed to achieve the ideal level of sweetness without going too overboard, making two desserts easy as pie.\n\nOr pop out to Cafe\u0301 Lavinal, which is awarded the Bib Gourmand status, for a bistro lunch. Because there\u2019s no such thing as too many oysters. Or too much wine!\n\nChef Julien Lefebvre creates stunning dishes that look too good to eat \u2013 though that didn\u2019t stop us\n\nDon\u2019t miss\n\nSipping wine dating back to 1989 for dinner is a norm in a place like Ch\u00e2teau Cordeillan-Bages. Wine tasting in 18th-century wineries and vineyard picnics are also on the agenda.\n\nBook a tour at Ormes de Pez winery for an introduction to the process of producing wine in the Medoc.There\u2019s a tasting session at the end of the tour \u2013 and in case you\u2019re a wine-tasting noob, there are tips on how to swirl the glass to draw oxygen from the air into the wine. Ormes de Pez has enough acidity to give it a really good swirl, bringing out a very warm and masculine flavour.\n\nCh\u00e2teau Lynch Bages (Red: Cabernet Sauvignon 75%, Merlot 15%, Cabernet Franc 10%) has maintained a particularly strong following for its succulent richness, especially when aged.\n\nThe winery was closed in 2017 in preparation for a comprehensive renovation of its wine-making facilities by American Architect Chien Chung Pei and is scheduled to reopen its doors in 2020.\n\nAnother essential is the luxury picnic, a new concept by the hotel that gives guests a portable gourmet meal to enjoy between chateau stops or cycling trips.\n\nThe Bages Box comes in medium-sized mason jars to contain the heat and make it easy to dine al fresco amid sun-dappled vineyards. And in style, bien s\u00fbr.\n\nYou can book or find out more about Ch\u00e2teau Cordeillan-Bages at cordeillanbages.com or find them on instagram here.\n\nGETTING THERE Fly into Bordeaux.
