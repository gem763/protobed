Idracowra has a carrying capacity of 7500 adult equivalents.\n\nMr Warriner said the sale of Idracowra prior to auction was a very positive signal of demand in the market, despite the current drought conditions.\n\n\u201cIdracowra\u2019s proximity to the Stuart Highway provided ease of access to Alice Springs and end-markets located to the south providing a logical addition to the purchaser's existing holdings,\" he said.\n\nIt continues a busy period of station sales in the Northern Territory, with JLL recently selling Retreat Station in the Jundah region of Queensland for $20 million to the Taroom-based Speed family.\n\nOther major station sales include cattle operation Suplejack Station which sold for $21 million at auction to Robert Savage and his family, also through JLL.\n\n\"What has been significant is that local buyers continue to be represented strongly in the current market. To me, this is sending a compelling message as to how sustainable the rural industry is, despite the persisting drought conditions,\" Mr Warriner said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Holgar said Idracowra generated significant levels of interest as it represented an \"efficient, low-cost pastoral enterprise enabling the supply of livestock to primarily southern domestic markets\".\n\nIn other recent outback station sales, David and Suzanne Bassingthwaighte bought Epenarra, a 265,800-hectare NT cattle station on the lower Barkly Tableland. The property had been marketed by Landmark Harcourts with a sale price of $16 million.\n\nThe 101,000-hectare Scott Creek Station, once owned by the Sultan of Brunei, sold for $12 million to Argentinian agricultural company Cross Pacific Investments earlier this year.", "description": "One of the Northern Territory's renowned pastoral holdings, Idracowra Station, is back in local hands after being sold by a company owned by Abu Dhabi's royal family.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2627%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_189/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4260cdda01f8dd7c58e2bbaf9e3c98e7b7e200bc", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
