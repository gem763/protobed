She felt the sleeping tablets she was taking were the only thing keeping her sane. Though a man who might have had something to do with the kidnapping was eventually arrested, she didn\u2019t have answers and kept believing her daughter, Rehana Kwena Moshoeshoe (then 15), was still live.\n\nThen came a call two months ago. Someone had met a homeless young woman in the Pretoria CBD who looked exactly like Rehana.\n\nThe well-spoken homeless woman had made an impact on this person and she remembered her again when, not long after their meeting on the streets, she coincidentally saw a pamphlet for the missing Rehana which had recently been distributed again on social media. This woman was struck by the resemblance between the two young women and managed to contact an old school friend of Rehana\u2019s from Kimberley Girls\u2019 High School.\n\nThis friend got in touch with Mpho who informed her about the woman\u2019s chance meeting with a girl who looked just like her long-lost daughter.\n\nMpho didn\u2019t waste a moment and in August she met, Candice Modisenyana (22), who\u2019s known on the streets as Karabo.\n\n\u201cThe resemblance was overwhelming \u2013 almost every feature: the eyes, the high forehead. I couldn\u2019t stop staring at her. But I didn\u2019t want to get too excited. I asked her, \u2018Do you know me? Where are you from\u2019?\u201d\n\nAt the time of Rehana\u2019s disappearance, Frans Olifant (then 38), was arrested in Lichtenburg. There had been text messages between him and Rehana on his phone that he couldn\u2019t explain. He was found guilty and sentenced to 36 years in prison for kidnapping, as well as other crimes including rape, arson and theft.\n\nRehana\u2019s body was never found and Mpho went to see Olifant in prison but got no closer to the truth.\n\nThe young woman Mpho met in Pretoria looked exactly like Rehana, but the mom soon realised she didn\u2019t sound like her. Karabo\u2019s voice was much deeper, and her background far removed from the Northern Cape.\n\n\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t recognise me. She told me she\u2019s from Klerksdorp, that she\u2019s adopted . . .\u201d\n\nMpho and Rehana\u2019s brother, Hussein (28), returned home without their Rehana.\n\n\u201cI had so much hope when we drove there,\u201d Hussein says. \u201cI believed when we drove home, Rehana would be with us. But we lost Rehana, then found her and lost her all over again.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after Mpho met Candice (Karabo), Mpho found out Candice had also appeared on the well-known Afrikaans magazine programme Kw\u00eala when they visited the homeless in Pretoria earlier this year. In this insert, which was posted on YouTube in May, one can again see the uncanny resemblance. Karabo is seen telling Kw\u00eala in fluent Afrikaans she was an adopted child who grew up with a white couple. But after the couple divorced, she eventually ended up on the streets.\n\nPictures of Karabo as a teenager also surfaced that seem to disprove that her and Rehana are the same person.\n\nStill, though they doubt the young woman is Rehana, Mpho hasn\u2019t given up all hope. The only thing that can provide a definitive answer is the results of a DNA test \u2013 for which they could wait weeks or even months.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to stay calm. I don\u2019t want to get depressed again. I\u2019m ready for everything and anything, no matter the outcome [of the tests],\u201d Mpho says.\n\nOn the morning she disappeared, Rehana had left home to go to town. She\u2019d wanted to buy an outfit to wear to the Lira concert she had tickets for the following week. But her family never saw her again.\n\n\u201cI just want my daughter back. It doesn\u2019t matter where she is or what happened \u2013 we\u2019ll get her back on the right path,\u201d Mpho says. \u201cSometimes when I pray, I tell God, \u2018It\u2019s too dark. Please let there be light\u2019.\u201d\n\nNot a day goes by that the family doesn\u2019t miss Rehana. \u201cShe was a bubbly person. She was good with people and easy-going \u2013 a lot like Karabo.\u201d", "description": "The mother of a Kimberley girl who went missing nine years ago talks about what happened when she met a woman who looks just like her missing daughter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9474/3a0e9323b44b4e9ea0ffa7680c2187ef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
