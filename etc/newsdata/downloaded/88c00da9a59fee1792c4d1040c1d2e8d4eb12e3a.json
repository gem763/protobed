While some said the Emmy-winning star didn\u2019t deserve to go to prison, many others insisted she should have been given more jail time.\n\nCritics cited examples of low-income individuals and people of color receiving years in jail for such minor offenses as stealing a loaf of bread. Others mentioned Connecticut mom Tanya McDowell, who in 2012 was sentenced to five years in prison for enrolling her son in a school district where he didn\u2019t live. According to the Connecticut Post, McDowell told the court she was seeking a \u201cbetter education\u201d for the little boy.\n\nHuffman offered a similar explanation for paying a fixer $15,000 to have someone correct her oldest daughter\u2019s answers on an SAT exam.\n\nSocial media users pointed out the disparities between the sentences, with some saying Huffman\u2019s 14-day sentence is a result of celebrity privilege and or white privilege.\n\nLegend addressed the issue in a series of tweets. Without saying Huffman\u2019s name, the Grammy-winning singer/songwriter suggested Americans have become \u201cdesensitized\u201d to the U.S. prison system.\n\n\u201cI get why everyone gets mad when rich person X gets a short sentence and poor person of color Y gets a long one,\u201d he began. \u201cThe answer isn\u2019t for X to get more; it\u2019s for both of them to get less (or even none!!!) We should level down not up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans have become desensitized to how much we lock people up. Prisons and jails are not the answer to every bad thing everyone does, but we\u2019ve come to use them to address nearly every societal ill,\u201d he continued.\n\nAmericans have become desensitized to how much we lock people up. Prisons and jails are not the answer to every bad thing everyone does, but we've come to use them to address nearly every societal ill. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 14, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nLegend then mentioned some of the cases people cited as examples of inequities in sentencing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insane we locked a woman up for 5 years for sending her kid to the wrong school district. Literally everyone involved in that decision should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nIt's unconscionable that we locked a woman up for voting when, unbeknownst to her, she was ineligible. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 14, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThe musician went on to argue that nothing is gained by locking up Huffman for 14 days, writing: \u201cNo one in our nation will benefit from the 14 days an actress will serve for cheating in college admissions.\u201d\n\nAnd no one in our nation will benefit from the 14 days an actress will serve for cheating in college admissions. We don\u2019t need to lock people up for any of this stuff. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 14, 2019\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
