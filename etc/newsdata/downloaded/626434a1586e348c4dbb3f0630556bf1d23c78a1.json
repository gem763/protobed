I'm sobered up now, I'm eating a BLT sandwich, I've got to be a bridesmaid for my sister and my foot is like this.\n\n\"Apparently I can't walk on it. I've got to pack. But what a fun night, it was really fun, I'll just have to be a big girl about it.\"\n\n(Image: Mike Marsland/WireImage)\n\nOn the plane, Helen then held up her hands to show that her nails were ruined and asked for recommendations for good nail technicians.\n\nAnd when Scott started poking fun at her burned foot, she rolled up the divider between the seats, joking it was her favourite part of the holiday.\n\nMum-of-two Helen has clearly been letting her hair down as she partied at the fancy Le Royal Meridien Beach Resort.\n\nBut sadly it ended in an injury.\n\nDespite the drama, Helen made it to the Lake District for the wedding.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
