(Henry Nicholls/Reuters)\n\nBritain reached a tentative agreement with Brussels on Thursday regarding its exit from the European Union.\n\n\u201cThis new deal ensures that we #TakeBackControl of our laws, borders, money and trade without disruption & establishes a new relationship with the EU based on free trade and friendly cooperation,\u201d British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced via Twitter.\n\n\u201cThis is a deal which allows us to get Brexit done and leave the EU in two weeks\u2019 time,\u201d he continued, adding that \u201cParliament should get Brexit done on Saturday.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere there is a will there is a deal \u2013 we have one,\u201d wrote European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on hist Twitter account. \u201cIt\u2019s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is a testament to our commitment to find solutions.\u201d\n\nJohnson still faces resistance from his coalition\u2019s Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, which has refused to support the new agreement.\n\nNegotiations had stalled over the question of how to deal with goods crossing between Ireland and Northern Ireland, the former of which is in the E.U. while the latter is part of Britain. Setting up customs checkpoints on the Northern Irish border with Ireland would have violated the 1998 Good Friday agreement, which ended decades of conflict in the region.\n\nThe new agreement keeps Northern Ireland in the U.K. customs zone while tariffs will be applied on goods traveling from Britain to Northern Ireland if those goods are marked for a destination beyond Northern Ireland\u2019s borders.\n\nThe DUP, however, could \u201cnot support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues and there is a lack of clarity on VAT,\u201d said DUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds in a statement.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage voiced discontent with the deal, writing on Twitter that \u201cthe \u2018new deal\u2019 is not Brexit, despite improvements on the customs union.\u201d\n\nLabour Party head Jeremy Corbyn has also refused to support the deal, pushing instead for another referendum on whether to leave the E.U.\n\n\u201cFrom what we know, it seems the Prime Minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May\u2019s,\u201d Corbyn wrote on his Facebook page. \u201cThis sell-out deal won\u2019t bring the country together and should be rejected.\u201d", "description": "\"This is a deal which allows us to get Brexit done and leave the EU in two weeks\u2019 time,\" said Boris Johnson. \"Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday.\"", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Lee Edwards", "Kevin D.
