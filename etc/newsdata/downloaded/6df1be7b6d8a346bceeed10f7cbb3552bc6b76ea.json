Many of the candidates are sticking to vague rhetoric about their tax plans. Others are pitching changes that go beyond the scope of the 2017 law.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Which pieces of the 2017 tax law would you keep? And which should be repealed? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not getting sucked into a discussion about which specific provisions they\u2019re going to keep,\u201d said Seth Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a think tank aligned with Democrats. \u201cThey\u2019re being bold on the investment side and also bold on the tax side.\u201d\n\nThe tax-law dilemma echoes Republicans\u2019 promises to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which backfired once voters saw the details and feared they would lose coverage or see costs rise.\n\nA Democratic president would likely need the party to retain control of the House and regain the Senate in 2020 to make much of a dent in the law.\n\n\u201cDemocrats can easily suggest repeal without the political risks, as few understand how most Americans received a tax cut in the early years,\u201d said Nicole Kaeding of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, a nonprofit research group affiliated with a conservative organization. \u201cBut an explicit repeal attempt would be fraught with difficulties.\u201d\n\nThe law remains unpopular: A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in May found 27% of respondents in favor and 36% opposed. Just 5% of Democrats said the law was a good idea.\n\nDemocratic candidates Juli\u00e1n Castro, former U.S. Housing and Urban Development secretary, and California Sen. Kamala Harris advocate full repeal of the law, which passed without any Democratic votes.\n\nMr. Castro said the law would be repealed within his first 100 days. Ms. Harris has said she would pair repeal with other tax policies, including a proposal to give tax credits up to $500 per month to households making under $100,000 and one to offer assistance to renters.\n\nOther candidates, such as former Vice President Joe Biden, say they want to repeal the tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations, though they have shied away from explaining where they would set rates and breaks. Mr. Biden\u2019s climate-change plan says he would be \u201creversing the excesses\u201d of the 2017 law.\n\nStill others have zeroed in on individual policies. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet proposed repealing the tax law\u2019s 20% deduction for pass-throughs such as partnerships and S corporations. He called the break egregious and said the money could be better used for apprenticeships, wage insurance and other programs to assist workers.\n\nMost campaigns haven\u2019t offered a full tax agenda. Unlike Republicans, whose voters in the 2016 primary viewed taxes as a distinct policy area, Democrats typically take a more piecemeal approach.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren had said relatively little about the 2017 law until this month, when she proposed raising $1 trillion in unspecified taxes to pay for her climate-change agenda.\n\nMany Republicans have proposed extending the 2017 law\u2019s individual tax cuts beyond their scheduled 2025 expiration date, and Mr. Trump has at times floated additional tax cuts.\n\n\u201cThe only thing Democrats know about taxes is that they\u2019ll raise them,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, communications director for his re-election campaign.\n\nMany Democrats say they do want to raise taxes on the top sliver of households, who now face a top rate of 37%. A top individual tax rate of at least 39.6%\u2014the level under Democratic Presidents Clinton and Obama\u2014draws wide consensus within the party.\n\nSo does a return to the estate-tax parameters that were in place in 2017 or even in 2009, before Congress reduced the number of people who have to pay.\n\nDemocrats also generally agree on setting corporate taxes at around the 28% rate that Mr. Obama supported\u2014above the 21% rate in place today but below the 35% rate that existed before Mr. Trump took office. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, however, backs the 35% rate, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota would go to 25% to pay for infrastructure and is considering going to 28%, with the remainder used for deficit reduction.\n\nBut the changes for middle- and lower-income households are trickier. The 2017 law expanded the standard deduction, lowered tax rates and increased the child tax credit. That was enough to outweigh new limits on other deductions and the end of the personal exemption.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me to take a run at taking them away from people,\u201d said Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, a progressive coalition. \u201cWhat you do is take away the things that benefit the top 2% and major corporations. And you call it a day.\u201d\n\nInternational provisions of the 2017 law also would be complicated to repeal. They led to dramatic changes to corporate structures, and it would be technically challenging to undo those rules in 2021, under a Democratic president, more than three years after they began taking effect.\n\nDemocrats have been relatively quiet about the law\u2019s cap on the state and local tax deduction, which disproportionately affected high-tax Democratic states such as New York, New Jersey and California. The benefits of repealing that cap would go disproportionately to high-income households, and relatively little would go to states with early presidential-primary votes.\n\nWrite to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com", "description": "President Trump\u2019s biggest legislative achievement\u2014the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u2014will be on the ballot with him next year, and Democratic contenders for his job are trying to figure out how to approach it.", "authors": ["Richard Rubin", "Richard.Rubin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106426/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
