There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son, and the Ukrainian firm has not been convicted of any criminal activities.\n\nThe intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s report says Mr Volker provided advice to Ukrainian leaders about how to \u201cnavigate\u201d Mr Trump\u2019s demands for a Ukrainian government probe of the Bidens and Burisma.\n\nRudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney. has said Mr Volker offered to put him in touch with an aide to the Ukrainian president.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump flails wildly at enemies as Democrats increase pressure\n\nThe deposition comes just after reports revealed Mr Volker met with a top official from Burisma last year, even as Mr Giuliani was pressing Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate the company and the Bidens' involvement with it.\n\nMr Volker reported met in September 2018 with Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board of directors of Burisma, on the sidelines of an event held by a Washington-based foreign policy think tank.\n\nThe September 2018 encounter was likely to be a subject of questioning during his testimony on Capitol Hill after photos from the event on the Burisma website showed the two men together.\n\nThe encounter also highlighted the dissonance between Mr Giuliani\u2019s assertions on Twitter that Burisma was a \u201ccorrupt company\u201d and demands that the Bidens\u2019 role be investigated, and the envoy\u2019s efforts to conduct day-to-day relations with Ukraine\u2019s government and corporate interests.\n\nDetails of the pair\u2019s meeting was not immediately available, though Burisma said in a statement that Mr Pozharskyi \u201cheld a number of meetings with US officials\u201d.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Trump flails wildly at enemies as Democrats increase pressure", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s former US special representative for Ukraine is testifying before congressional committees investigating the president over allegations he abused his power and withheld financial aid to the country while asking for dirt on a political rival.Kurt Volker, who abruptly resigned from his post", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YCvlCOL75HeKTmKWJFmN2w--~B/aD0zOTM7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/a4f9896c78e6d441017ea0de373e094b", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
