Stuck in car park now for 35 minutes,\" she explained.\n\n\"May be worth telling people to avoid unless necessary.\"\n\nEmma Farrell, woke up first thing to nab the best bargains and to take photos.\n\n\"Hundreds of toys were up to half price, but not all of them had the 50% off tag,\" she said.\n\n\"I saw Harry Potter, LEGO, Barbie, remote controlled cars... but no Dyson vacuum.\"\n\n(Image: Emma Farrell of LatestDeals.co.uk)\n\n(Image: Emma Farrell of LatestDeals.co.uk)\n\nOn Tuesday, a Sainsbury's worker leaked that Dyson vacuums would be down to \u00a350 on Wednesday morning.\n\nHowever, the retailer was quick to quash any hopes of finding one, after saying it's taking place in selected, unconfirmed stores only.\n\n\"You could see people wandering up and down the vacuum aisle looking for them,\" shopper Emma said.\n\n\"Staff said it was a false rumour and they hadn't been sent any. Tbh, people at Latest Deals thought it was too good to be true so I wasn't surprised.\n\n\"My top tip is to use the handheld shopping scanners. Some toys don't have the discounted price displayed, so if you use the scanner you can see what the sale price is. And don't forget your Nectar card!\"\n\nTom Church, at deals blog LatestDeals , added: \"October toy sales are a great way to spread the cost of Christmas.\n\n\"Argos is doing 10 weeks of toy promotions, with 25% off Chad Valley this week, and then also hot on the bargain hunter's calendar is 25% off ASDA George kids clothing on Thursday, and Sainsbury's Tu Clothing 25% off on Tuesday.\n\n\"With Black Friday around the corner, it's becoming an exciting time for deals!\"", "description": "Sainsbury's workers say they've been inundated with calls since the early hours of this morning over the retailer's flash promotions", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Plymouth Herald", "Emma Farrell Of Latestdeals.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20596223.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PRIO-Chaos-in-Sainsburys-with-35-minute-queues-after-toy-sale-and-Dyson-offer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
