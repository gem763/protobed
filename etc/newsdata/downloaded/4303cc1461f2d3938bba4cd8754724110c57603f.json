WU and online retail giant, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN have come together to launch Amazon PayCode in the United States. This service, to be available in a few weeks, will enable Amazon\u2019s customers pay for online purchases in cash at any of Western Union's 15,000 U.S. locations.\n\nSo far Amazon\u2019s customers have been using Amazon Cash, which enabled them to load cash into their Amazon Balance for making online purchases. Following this partnership, PayCode, another cash payment mode has been introduced and is available in more than 100,000 cash-loading locations nationwide.\n\nThis service has been rolled out to address customers\u2019 desire to pay in cash for their online purchases. Providing cash payment services at Western Union will make it easier for customers, given that nearly 80% of Americans live within five miles of the money transferor\u2019s 15,000 locations. This will boost the number of customers for Amazon and consequently for Western Union.\n\nThis service is an extension of PayCode rolled out in 10 countries \u2014 Chile, Columbia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Peru, Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand\u2014 earlier this year. It enabled shoppers in these regions pay for Amazon items using local currencies. Consumers in these markets would go to Western Union outposts and pay for their purchases in cash.\n\nTo expand its business reach, Western Union has been making several tie ups and partnership with banks, retailers, post offices across the globe. These tie ups and partnerships are in line with the company's efforts to grow its market share amid rising competition from many fintech companies such as PayPal Holdings, Inc. PYPL and Square Inc SQ that have entered the payments space in recent years and are fast eating into the market share with their low cost and efficient services.\n\nWestern Union has also streamlined its business operations by recent sale of three of its businesses\u2013 Speedpay, U.S. domestic bill pay business, Walletron, a provider of mobile bill presentment solutions and Paymap mortgage payments services.\n\nPart of the funds generated from the above business will be used for sharebuyback and debt payoff, which will aid the company\u2019s bottom line and reduce its leverage.\n\nThe company's revenues have been under pressure. High compliance costs and foreign exchange volatility have further weighed on its profitability.\n\nYear to date, its stock is up 23% compared with the industry 's growth of 18%.\n\nWestern Union carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\n5 Stocks Set to Double\n\n\n\nEach was hand-picked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2020.
